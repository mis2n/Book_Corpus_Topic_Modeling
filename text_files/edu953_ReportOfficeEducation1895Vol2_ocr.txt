Number in elementary schools, 694,218, or 97.3 per cent of the pupils in all schools, 
The general features of the school system indicate that it is estab- 
lished by authority of the State. A law of 1842 provided for a station- 
ary school (fasta folkskola) in each church district or parish, or for 
ambulatory schools (flyttande folkskola) where the character of the 
country prevented attendance on the stationary schools. Preparatory 
schools (smiskolor) for children from 7 to 9 years of age are to be 
established in mountainous districts. A teachers’ seminary (normal- 
skola) is to be established in each chief town of a diocese. Higher 
grade elementary schools (hégre folkskolor) have been obligatory since 
1858 in villages and districts where there are more than 60 pupils. 
The secondary grades (hégre allminna liroverken) include two divi- 
sions, which correspond to the classical or Latin schools, and to Real 
schools with course of study fitting for practical life. Professional 
schools, special schools, and the universities complete the public school 
system. 
The elementary schools are maintained by the district with help from

the State; secondary and normal schools receive aid‘ from the State, 
which also gives subsidies to private schools of this grade. There are 
special State subsidies for the extension of sloyd training, for technical 
instruction, and for the universities and medical school. 
The general control of the schools is vested in central boards of 
officers connected with the different ministries at Stockholm. The 
ministry of education and ecclesiastical affairs has two educational 
divisions, the one having general control of elementary and normal, the 
other of secondary and higher schools. 
The uniyersities are under direct charge of a council, which is affili- 
ated with the ministry, but has the chancellor or rector of the university 
as chief officer. Special schools are adjuncts of the ministry of the inte- 
rior or of finance; military schools of the ministry of army and navy. 
Special inspectors have oversight of elementary schools in each diocese, 
visiting the schools and reporting to the district-school board and con- 
sistory, and later to the department or ministry of education and eccle- 
siastical affairs. Each district has its school board, whichis under the 
eontrol of the church authorities; it superintends all elementary and 
preparatory schools, extends a certain supervision over private schools, 
and reports to the chapter of the bishopric of the diocese. Thus, it may 
be seen that one of the main features of the Swedish school system is the 
influence of the church over the school. The bishop and chapter (con- 
sistory) in every diocese carefully supervise all schools, watching over 
their development. The secondary schools have a board of school 
directors for local management, but the bishop as ephor of all the schools 
of the diocese outranks this board. The normal schools are under the 
direct supervision of the chapter of the diocese in which they are situ- 
ated, but a higher control over these training schools for teachers is 
exercised by the chief of the division of the ministry of education and 
ecclesiastical affairs at Stockholm having special charge of normal 
schools. The local officials report to the higher officials in Stockholm, 
as above indicated, and these in turn to the King, who is the highest 
educational authority, possessing in school matters both legislative and 
executive power. 
SCHOOLS AND THEIR METHODS.” 
The main features of the administration of the school system having 
been summarized on the preceding page, it remains to present whatever 
may appear to be additional to the statements presented in former — 
reports published by this office. The present conspectus necessarily 
reiterates much that has been said before, but, as it is taken in the main 
from the “Reports from the Swedish Ladies’ Committee to the World’s 
  
1 The instruction in secondary schools is nearly free, amounting to only about $8 or $10 for each 
pupil. (Thesis of Dr. N. G. W. Lagerstedt presented at International Congress of Education in 
Chicago, 1893.)

  970 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Columbian Exposition at Chicago, in 1893,” there is a noticeable femi- 
nine tone, and special stress is laid upon the woman’s side of the 
educational question, the training of girls, etc. 
To promote education it is stated that larger amounts “ are expended 
in Sweden than in other European countries in proportion to the insig- 
nificant national property of the country.” Instruction in the State or 
national schools is mainly gratuitous and scholarships are bestowed 
annually. Admission to Government offices requires a high standard 
of knowledge, and hence the school standard is kept up proportionally. 
Education in the national or common schools is similar for both sexes, 
but secondary education for boys is differently organized from that for 
girls. The boys are educated by the State free of cost, while the higher 
education for girls is “an entirely private undertaking.” Privateschools 
sometimes obtain State and municipal grants; boarding schools are not 
found in Sweden. There are none for boys and only one of special 
importance for girls. 
The object of the national schools is to give to the rising generation 
of Sweden the first elements of education. Thus they correspond to 
the Volks or Elementarschulen of Germany, the Ecoles primaires of 
France, and the board schools of England. 
« The establishment of such schools goes as far back as the end of the 
sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century. 
According to the ecclesiastical law of 1686 nobody could get married 
without knowing Luther’s catechism,’ and the rector of each parish, 
moreover, was to take special care that the young people of his district 
learned to read “out of a book.” The duty of teaching this subject 
devolved upon the chaplain and the sacristan. 
By means of voluntary contributions from private people as well as 
from parishes, several national schools were established by degrees; 
but as late as 1840 more than half of the parishes in the Kingdom had 
no such schools. Many children, however, learned fo read at home. 
By the ordinance of June 18, 1842, it was settled that in each parish 
there should be at least one schdol (stationary if possible) with a duly 
approved teacher, and that the attendance should be compulsory, with 
an exception only for those children who obtained corresponding 
instruction at home or at another school. 
The school expenditures were then defrayed by the parishes; a poor 
parish could, however, obtain a grant from the State for the teacher's 
salary. 
Since 1875 the State has paid two-thirds of a teacher’s salary, which 
amounted to 700 crowns ($187)? The rest is paid by the parish. The 
parish expenses for the national schools amounted in the year 1890 to 
19.1 per cent of the sum total.* The State allows the parishes more

2.4 Swedish crown is equivalent to 27 cents, computed at 26.8. 
21 the same year the exponses of the parishes for ecclesiastical purposes amounted to 15.6 per cent 
and for the poor to 15.7 per cent of the whole sum.

than 4,500,000 crowns ($1,206,000), that is, 8 per cent of the whole 
budget. In 1891 the expenses for the national schools amounted to 
13,566,825 crowns ($3,635,915). 
In the same year the pupils were 692,093 of both sexes, the whole 
population amounting to 4,774,409 persons. 
The instruction is free and equal for boys and girls. 
Coeducation is everywhere prevalent up to 10 years of age; in the 
rural schools it is generally carried on throughout the school period. 
The cost of schoolhouses and apparatus is paid by the parish, and 
both are—particularly in the large towns—of superior quality. New 
schoolhouses are built every year, but nevertheless, the classes in town 
generally have 30 to 40 children each. 
The school age is from 7 to 14. In the “Normal plan for instruction 
in national and infant schools” of 1878, the course of study in a station- 
ary infant school was fixed for two years and that of a stationary 
national school—being a continuation of the former—for four years or 
six years. 
Within each school district containing a parish, the board—chosen 
by the voting members of the parish—exercises an immediate influence 
over the instruction of the people. Above this board is the bishop and 
the chapter of each diocese. The supreme direction remains with the 
Government through the medium of the department of instruction, 
which since 1861 has appointed inspectors, who visit the schools on its 
behalf. 
The national schools are of several kinds: 
(1) Infant schools (smaskolor) were established in 1858. The object 
of the infant school is to teach the children the elements of reading, 
writing, religion, arithmetic, and (in the towns) needlework according 
to new, practical methods. Sometimes these schools are connected with 
the national schools. In Stockholm there exist no separate infant 
schools. 
(2) National schools proper (egentliga folkskolor), which must be pro- 
vided with teachers examined at the-training colleges.1 These schools 
impart instruction in plain and fluent reading of the Swedish language, 
printed in Roman as well as black-letter type, generally acquired by 
the phonetic method; in religion and Bible history, up to the standard 
required by the clergy for being allowed to attend a confirmation class; 
in church singing, ‘with exception for those who have no ear for music; 
in writing, and the four rules of arithmetic. The result gained is that 
all read well (in Sweden there exist, according to the statistics furnished 
at the enrollment of conscripts in 1890, only 0.5 per cent of analphabets 
and among the emigrants to America there are no illiterates); that the 
majority write a good hand (for good handwriting the national schools 
of Stockholm carried the first prize at the Philadelphia Exposition of 
1876); and they spell fairly well. Beyond this compulsory minimum 
1 The term training college is used for normal school throughout this article.

  course, instruction is imparted in geography, Swedish and general his- 
tory; arithmetic, to and including double rule of three in whole num- 
bers and fractions; geometry, geometrical drawing, and natural history. 
In the national schools gymnastics and military drill are also taught, 
and in some of them gardening and manual work. A special grant for 
manual work (sloyd) for boys was not given until1878. Needlework is 
learned in schoolin towns by the girls and in some of the schools in the 
country—in all about one-third of the schools. There is a movement to 
to bring it into every school. In the upper classes for girls cookery 
has begun to be introduced since 1889, and has led to good results.! 
These schools, however, do not prepare for the higher schools, though 
there are always pupils passing from the one to the other. 
(3) Minor schools (mindre folkskolor), which are to be found in the 
provinces, and are but few in number, can be said as a rule to extend 
their instruction only to the minimum course. The teachers in them 
are not required to pass the national teachers’ examination, and have 
generally a lower salary. 
(4) Besides, there are so-called continuation schools (fortsittnings- 
skolor), the object of which is to give in one or two years further instrue- 
tion to those pupils who, with good testimonials, have passed through 
the national school and wish to increase their knowledge for practical 
purposes. 
(5) Higher national schools (hégre folkskolor) are schools possessed 
in common by several parishes in the country and arranged with the 
purpose of giving an opportunity to the children of the working classes 
to attain a higher standard of learning, while at the same time the 
pupils may continue their manual labor. These schools are open but 
twenty-four weeks a year. Only those pupils who have gone through 
the national schools are admitted. The subjects are the same as in the 
schools before named, except that a foreign language is sometimes 
taught. The teachers must have studied at the university. These 
schools are not many in number, and should not be confounded with the 
people’s high schools (folkhégskolor) or the burgher schools (borgar- 
skolor) in the towns. About half of these schools are mixed. The 
others are for boys. If a school claims a State grant for the teacher’s 
salary the annual time of instruction must extend over eight months in 
ayear at least. The daily hours of attendance in the national school 
ought not to exceed six and in the infant school not more than five. 
As a rule, the instruction at almost all of the infant schools has been 
kept up by women teachers, and for that reason the appointment of 
women as teachers in national schools may be counted from the time 
these schools were established (in 1858). Before that time female school 
teachers were only few in number. At the national school proper the 
employment of female teachers in ordinary was sanctioned by the stat- 
  
1Tn Germany it began in 1890. Cooking schools will be mentioned farther on. In 1890 in Stock- 
holm, and a year later in Géteborg, warm and cold baths were arranged for the pupils of the national 
schools, and these baths have exercised a salutary influence both morally and physically.

ute of October 21, 1859, which fixed at the same time the establishment 
of female training colleges. In 1868 the number of female teachers 
amounted to 29.6 per cent, compared to that of males. To what extent 
female teachers have been further employed at the schools appears 
from the synopsis below: 
  
Male teachers. | Female teachers. 
Year. cae ee teas a 
Number.| Percent. | Number. | Percent.     
4,832 5L8| 4,479 48.2 4; 829 40.9} 5,538 591 4,900 42 | 6,754 58 
  5, 060 39.7 | 7, 684 60.3 
Out of the whole number of female teachers in 1885, no less than 
4,624 were employed in the infant schools and 850 at minor schools, 
while only 1,280 served in the national schools proper. Of the last 
group, 776 were teachers in ordinary, viz, in the country 368 and in 
towns 408 (in Stockholm alone, 184). Reviewing the state of things in 
the whole country, such as they presented themselves in 1890, we find 
60.3 per cent of the teachers to be women and 39.7 per cent men. Thus, 
during each of the last twenty-four years, the number of female teach- 
ers has on the average risen more than 1 per cent. In the country the 
salary for male and female teachers is the same; in Stockholm a female 
teacher receives about two-thirds as much. 
The burgher’s school (borgarskola) of Stockholm is thus described: 
The origin of the high, or burgher’s, school for the working and middle 
classes in Stockholm was a Sunday and evening school for men, founded 
in 1836 by a private society. In 1882 the school was thoroughly reor- 
ganized, and advanced classes were established by the side of the lower 
ones existing before. In 1880-81 female pupils were admitted and at 
the same time female teachers were appointed. The school is supported 
by the annual fees of the society members, an appropriation from the 
city council, the artisan union, etc., and the school fees of the pupils. 
These, however, are excessively low, 2 crowns (53 cents) a term for 
twelve hours a week. The national school buildings are thrown open 
to the free use of the burgher school, the hours of attendance being 
Sundays 8.30 to 10.30 a. m. and 2.30 to 6.30 p.m.; week days 5 to 9.30 
p.m. The subjects of instruction are, in the lower division, Swedish, 
arithmetic, writing, geometry, free-hand and geometrical drawing; in 
the higher division (where the subjects are optional), the same, with 
the addition of bookkeeping and the German and English languages. 
Lectures are held upon history and geography, history of Swedish 
literature, politics and national economy, hygiene (with ambulance), 
chemistry, physics, astronomy, and other natural sciences, out of which 
four to six are to be found on each year’s reading plan. <A circulating 
library is open to the pupils free of cost. The school is managed by 
a head master with eight male teachers in ordinary and thirty-two 
assistant teachers, of whom ten are women. In 1890-91 the number of  
-P-A-G-E-16

pupils in nine parallel classes was 1,352, 410 of whom were females. 
These attend the lectures and the language classes simultaneously with 
the male pupils. Their age ranged from 14 to 30 or above. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
The secondary schools include the “hégre allmanna 4 Latinlinien 
fullstiindige laroverken” and the “hégre realliiroverken”—that is, clas- 
sical and modern schools. They were 75 in number in 1892-93, with 
14,608 students. It is stated that only about 30 of them fulfill require- 
ments leading to the universities. The cost of instruction amounts to 
from $8 to $10 for each student. In 1891 there were 650 students (15 
women) who passed the required examination for admittance to the 
universities. Expenditures for secondary education amount to about 
$1,000,000 annually. These schools are described by Dr. N. G. W. 
Lagerstedt as follows: 
The secondary schools ‘‘do not form a direct continuation of the primary schools 
as in tho United States,” although they are preparatory to university education. 
They aro all complete in their organization, although usually considered to be of 
two kinds, the higher or complete schools with nine classes, and the lower or incom- 
plete schools with two, three, or five classes. Yet ‘‘the teaching in these classes 
agrees precisely with that of the corresponding classes of the complete secondary 
‘schools.” The secondary schools consist of the classical and “modern” (Real) 
schools. The curriculum comprises nine years and the boys (girls are not admitted 
to these schools) must be 9 years of age before entering. The plan of instruction 
is the same for the first three years; during that period German is the only foreign 
language taught. Then a bifurcation takes place, some pursuing the Latin (clas- 
sical) course, others the English (modern) course. Still, in all subjects other than 
Latin and English, instruction is as a rule the same for the two following years. 
French is taken up in the fifth year, both in the modern end tho classical side. 
The last four years, the sixth to the ninth, the pupils of the modern and classical 
lines are separated, and at the same period—the sixth year—a new division takes 
place on the elassical side. Greek is taken up by some, English by others—that is, 
there is “‘a full classical section and a half classical section.” At the close of the 
secondary course the maturity, or graduation, examination takes place; the diploma 
attained, the student may then pass to the university, to military or forestry schools, 
or to low-grade positions in the Government service. This maturity examination 
is quite a severe one, and the boys of the modern (Real) side, not having studied 
Latin, must give special evidence of greater knowledge in mathematics, natural 
sciences, and modern languages than the boys on the classical side. 
According to reports of discussions, the intention is to bring the 
elementary and secondary grades more nearly together by “eliminat- 
ing one or more of the lower classes of the secondary schools and by 
making the elementary directly preparatory to the secondary school.” 
THE TEACHING FORCE.' 
‘When the infant schools were established in 1858 it was resolved that 
female teachers should be employed in them, and that a pupil who had 
passed the two lower classes of a training college for national schools

EDUCATION IN SWEDEN AND ICELAND. 975 
had the right to present herself as a candidate for the post of an infant 
school teacher. Special training colleges were also established by the 
district or diocesan authorities or else by private enterprise. 
The instruction at these colleges has hitherto generally covered a 
period of eight months, but has now in many places been extended to 
one or even two years. 
The training colleges provided by the authorities of the district or 
diocese are at present seventeen in number; those established by pri- 
vate individuals are five. They are all attended by female pupils; in 
some of the former there are also male pupils. 
The subjects of study at these training colleges are religious instruc- 
tion, Swedish language, arithmetic, didactics (in some also history and 
geography of Sweden and natural history), handwriting, drawing, 
singing, gymnastics, and needlework. 
In some districts there is a head master; in others, a head mistress. 
The assistant teacher at the infant school for practice connected with 
these training colleges is nearly always a woman. The salary of a head 
mistress varies between 1,200 and 2,000 crowns ($321 to $536). 
Besides the training colleges mentioned, there are in the far north 
of Sweden two establishments maintained by the State for the purpose 
of training male and female infant school teachers for the Finnish and 
Lapp schools in that part of the country. The Finnish training school 
at Haparanda has a course of study extending over three years and is 
managed by a head master, three male teachers, and a female teacher 
of needlework, The Lapp training school at Mattisudden (a village in 
Lapland) has a course of study extending over two years and is man- 
aged by a head master and an assistant female teacher. 
The instruction, which is carried on in Swedish in both, comprises 
the following subjects: Religious instruction, Swedish, Finnish (only 
at Haparanda), Lapp (only at Mattisudden), arithmetic, object lessons, 
handwriting, drawing, singing, gymnastics, and needlework. 
To be qualified for the profession of a national school teacher in Swe- 
den it is necessary to have passed through one of the training colleges 
of the Kingdom. In 1860 the right of applying for admission to a train- 
ing college was extended to women, and several female training colleges 
were established. 
Since 1878, to the three classes, of one year’s duration each, has been 
added a fourth, so that the course now extends over four years. The 
time of instruction at a training college extends annually over thirty- 
six weeks, divided in two terms. At the end of the spring term a final 
examination is held with the pupils of class four and an annual one 
with the three lower classes. The daily sessions are six hours in length, 
the time for gymnastics not included. 
The various subjects of instruction (which are the same at the male 
training colleges, with the addition of military drill), comprise: 
Religious instruction: Bible reading, sacred history, catechism, sey- 
eral hymns, and the outlines of church history.
-P-A-G-E-18
  976 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96 
Swedish language: Grammar, spelling, elocution, recitation, and com- 
position. 
Arithmetic: Elementary arithmetic, solving simple equations of one 
unknown quantity, extraction of the square and cube roots of numeri- 
cal quantities, and bookkeeping. : 
Geometry: Geometrical object instruction, measurement and caleu- 
lation of certain plane and solid figures. 
History: Swedish history (detailed) and the political constitution of 
the country, chief events and lives of the most famous personages out 
of general history. 
Geography: Physical and political (that of Sweden most minutely). 
Natural history and science: Zoology (comprehending knowledge of 
the human body and the laws of health), botany, chemistry, physics, 
the elements of geology and astronomy. ‘ 
Pedagogy and methods: Outlines of psychology, a pedagogical and 
methodical representation of the development of national schools. 
Drawing: Freehand and model drawing (also designing of easy 
objects of art and sloyd), the elements of perspective, and mechanical 
drawing. : 
Music and singing: Solo and part singing of chorals and patriotic 
songs, liturgies and hymns, scales and technical exercises, the princi- 
ples of harmony, organ. 
Gymnastics: With or without apparatus, marches, ete. 
Gardening and planting of trees: The elements. 
Needlework: The same courses as those of the national schools. 
The practical training begins in class 2, the pupils of which teach in 
the infant classes of the school for practice; it is continued with the 
pupils of class 3, who teach sacred history, elocution, and arithmetic in 
the national school classes, and is finished off in class 4, the pupils of 
which teach the other subjects in the same divisions of the school. The 
number of hours devoted to practical training are: In class 2, four hours 
a week; in class 3, four, and in class 4, fourteen. 
The teachers at each training college are to be a male head master 
(rector) and at least four assistant teachers, of whom one must be a 
woman. The qualifications for a coadjutrix are: (1) To have reached 
the age of 23 years; (2) to have passed the complete final examination, 
at the higher training college of Stockholm and to have obtained the 
highest testimonial in didactics and the second best in pedagogy and 
methods; (3) to have served at least a year at one of the State train- 
ing colleges and to have gained a good character in that employment, 
and (4) to have given evidence of practical skill of instruction before 
the consistory to which the training college is subordinate. 
A female teacher, having been nominated coadjutrix, only obtains a 
warrant of her appointment. If, after that time, she marries, it remains 
(in virtue of a new statute) with the consistory to decide whether she 
may keep her place or not. The obligatory time of instruction is
-P-A-G-E-19
EDUCATION IN SWEDEN AND ICELAND. 977 
twenty-four to twenty-eight hours a week. <A coadjutrix enjoys the 
same salary as a coadjutor, from 1,750 up to 3,500 crowns ($467 to $978). 
Besides the coadjutrixes, there are female assistant teachers engaged | 
at the schools for practice connected with the training colleges. Ata 
female training college, teachers in the so-called subjects of exercise, 
drawing, music, singing, and gymnastics, ought also to be women. 
At the Riksdag of 1844 the first claim was made on the State to take 
measures for the purpose of training able female teachers for the higher 
schools. The matter was dropped at that time, but at the Riksdag of 
1859-60 a subsidy was granted for the foundation of a higher female 
training college. It was established in Stockholm in 1861, and in 1862 
a higher school for girls (State model school) was ‘attached to it, in 
which the pupils had the opportunity of learning how to teach from 
practice. 
The conditions for admitting a pupil to the training college are that 
she have the standard of education imparted in a complete higher girls’ 
school, which always comprises three modern languages. These condi- 
tions, however, have been raised by the fact that there are more 
applicants ‘than places. The age of admittance was 17, but has now 
been raised to 18 years. The instruction is free of cost. 
The course of study extends over three years, to which a fourth (with 
complete liberty in the choice of subjects) can be added by those who 
wish to perfect themselves as teachers of some special subject. Terms, 
hours of attendance, hygienic conditions, etc., are equal to those of the 
higher schools. About twenty-five pupils are generally admitted every 
autumn. 
The subjects of instruction in the first division are: Religion, Swedish, 
French, German or English, geography, history, mathematics, natural 
history and science, and pedagogics. In the second division, physi- 
ology and hygienics are taught also; geography is dropped; German 
and English, mathematics, with the exception of arithmetic, as well as 
the conversational classes in foreign languages, are optional. In the 
third division this is also the case with natural sciences, foreign lIan- 
guages, drawing, and singing. The pupil must, however, study either 
one language or natural sciences. 
The instruction atthe training college is adapted to what may prove 
of use to the future teacher. The courses of study are strictly limited, 
clearly defined, thoroughly mastered, and the teaching is very method- 
ical. Great importance is attached to the correct writing and speaking 
of the Swedish language, as also to the pronunciation and grammar of 
foreign languages studied. 
The practical training of pupils is brought about partly by listening 
to lessons in the mcdel school and giving oral or written accounts of 
them, partly by exercises in questioning and narrating, and then by 
giving lessons in the model school. 
The fourth course, with the purpose of training specialists, was not
-P-A-G-E-20
  978 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
established till 1891. In that course the pupil carries on private 
studies in one to three subjects under the direction of the teachers at 
the training college. These studies should be more independent and 
less limited than the preceding ones, which might be said to form a 
continuation of the systematic school studies. In some of the subjects 
passed by a pupil during the fourth course her knowledge is considered 
equal to that for a bachelor’s degree. 
Instruction is imparted by masters and bachelors of art, paid by the 
State, and at the same rate with teachers in the boys’ schools. They also 
teach in the model school connected with the training college. Con- 
versational classes in foreign languages are kept up by foreign ladies 
or persons who have spent a long time abroad. At the head of the 
training college is a head master and a head mistress. As the number 
of applicants is very large the establishment of another training college 
has been spoken of, but since the universities are now open to women- 
there will most likely be no need of it. 
THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN.! 
In 1884 a commission of inquiry was appointed by the Government 
to examine into higher elementary education for girls and present a 
scheme for its improvement. This commission inquired carefully into 
the state of the schools, gathered copious statistics (presented to the 
public in the report of 1885) and worked out a plan for the higher edu- 
cation of girls. This work, however, has not as yet led to any practical 
result, either in one way or the other. 
The State has attended to the superior education of women by 
founding special female training colleges and by giving women the 
same rights as men in studying at the universities. 
Women are excluded from the professional schools of Sweden (for 
engineering, shipbuilding, veterinary surgery, etc.), but the fine-art 
schools and those for sloyd and gymnastics are open to both sexes. 
Private industrial schools also exist. 
The pedagogical influence exercised by woman upon the rising 
generation within the house may be said to have aided woman to find a 
new sphere of action outside her own home. As teachers, head mis- 
tresses of schools, members of school boards, lady inspectors, writers 
on pedagogies, ete., women have attained an influence which is steadily 
increasing. Woman’s work also affects the higher education of her 
own sex. 
Asa general observation it may be mentioned that the social position 
of a woman teacher in Sweden, be it as a governess or a school mis- 
tress, is a highly esteemed one. Daughters of higher officers in public 
service or otherwise, belonging to the best families, devote themselves 
to this noble calling. Many of the largest young ladies’ colleges are 
founded and chiefly managed by ladies; and the number of lady teachers 
  
1 As presented by the Swedish Ladies’ Committee.
-P-A-G-E-21
  EDUCATION IN SWEDEN AND ICELAND. 979 
increases with every year. In 1889 women obtained the right of being 
chosen members of parochial school boards, which exercise their influ- 
ence on the national schools. Miss Lilly Engstrém, teacher at the 
State Model School for Girls, was the first woman elected to this 
important function, and since then one lady after another has been 
chosen member of the board. The zeal shown by women in this new 
office has already been acknowledged. 
Parents who do not wish to send their daughters to the national 
schools, and who want them to get a knowledge of foreign languages, 
either send them to the higher schools for girls or to private classes, or 
else have them taught at home by governesses. The latter expedient 
prevailed up to the middle of our century, and with families living in 
the country is still in general use. 
In Giteborg a merchant, Mr. Kjellberg, founded a school for girls 
in 1826, and in Stockholm the historiographer, A. Fryxell, and J. O. 
Wallin, later archbishop, another in 1840. These schools are still in 
existence, and may be looked upon as the oldest girls’ schools of Sweden, 
in which the course of study includes several modern languages, mathe- 
matics, and natural sciences. In the fourth and fifth decades of this 
century women themselves took the initiative in the direction men- 
tioned, and Miss Cecilia Fryxell and Mrs. Jane Tengberg established 
schools in Westeras and Upsala, which have exercised great infinence 
on female instruction in Sweden. 
At the Riksdag of 1862 a subsidy was granted to a model school for 
girls in connection with the higher female training college founded the 
year before, which is the only school for girls that has a staff paid by 
the State. This school was soon enlarged to a college of eight classes, 
and became more or less a model for other schools, though this was 
done voluntarily and without any intervention of the State. 
In Sweden there exist at the present moment about 124 higher 
schools for girls, which fall under two heads. 
* Endowed schools, with an annual State grant not exceeding 2,000 
crowns ($536), and which receive a certain number of free pupils. These 
schools are under the control of the State, but are at liberty to plan 
their instruction independently. These number 76. Then there are 
unendowed schools. 
Schools of the two categories belong to parishes, associations, or 
private individuals. If district authorities contribute toward a girls’ 
higher school, this generally involves the right of electing one or more 
members of the school board. In most of these girls’ schools the board 
consists of men; at one school it is made up of women exclusively. 
Some schools have obtained donations from private individuals and 
societies, but as a rule they are supported by fees, varying between 
50 and 200 crowns ($13.40 and $53) a year for each pupil. 
In many places the location of the schools is far from satisfactory, 
especially when compared with the boys’ colleges, which are built like  
-P-A-G-E-22
  980 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
  palaces by the parish and the State. The appliances can rarely bear 
comparison with those of the boys’ schools. Connected with most of 
the schools for girls is a preparatory school with two or three classes, 
receiving beginners (often including boys) generally at 6 years of age. 
The higher school proper has in the larger towns eight classes, of one 
year’s duration each. In some of the larger towns there exists, con- 
nected with the higher school proper, a so-called continuation school, 
having for its objects (1) to prepare for admission to the university, 
or (2) to the higher training college; (3) training of teachers, or (4) 
imparting knowledge necessary for a good general education or one 
required in practical oceupations. 
The school year is divided into two parts—the spring and the autumn 
terms. The summer holidays extend over the months of June, July, 
and August. In general, the annual instruction covers only a time of 
thirty-two weeks. In the preparatory school the hours of attendance 
are mostly three to four a day; in the school proper and the continua- 
tion school, generally five (home work excepted). Of the three modern 
languages studied in school, two are, as a rule, optional. In many 
schools this is also the case with geometry, needlework, singing, and 
drawing. 
Instruction by means of questions and answers is the one chiefly in 
use. Examinations at the end of the school year rarely take place at 
girls’ schools, except in those schools which prepare for the university, 
The pupil is examined on admission, and then, if at the end of the 
spring term she has a sufficient number of marks at the repetitions, 
moves into a higher class; if not, she has the opportunity of making 
up her marks by studying during the long summer vacation. 
Competitions and distributions of prizes hardly ever occur. 
Religious instruction begins in the preparatory school with narratives 
from sacred history, orally rendered and illustrated by pictures, and 
with easy hymns learned by heart. In the school proper, Bible history 
is studied out of a text-book; Luther’s smaller catechism is learned, 
with explanations; later on, a Bible manual, and, in the highest classes, 
church history. Bible reading takes place partly during the Scripture 
lessons and at morning prayers. 
The girls’ school of Sweden attempts more and more to make the 
Swedish language its principal subject. The pupils are taught to 
express themselves clearly and distinctly in speaking and writing their 
mother tongue. They are also made acquainted with our best poets 
and prose writers. Reading is taught by the phonetic method. At 
about 10 years of age the study of grammar begins; later, composi- 
tion, which first consists of writing down something told or read to the 
pupil. In the higher classes, the history of Swedish literature is 
studied; Norwegian and Danish authors are also read. 
Instruction in Swedish history generally begins in the highest class 
of the preparatory school. In this, as well as in the lower classes of
-P-A-G-E-23
  EDUCATION IN SWEDEN AND ICELAND. 981 
the school proper, the historical facts are imparted chiefly by the 
teacher’s oral narratives out of ancient Scandinavian history. In teach- 
ing, attempts are made more and more to abandon that method which 
consists of the mere learning of names, dates, and dry compilations, 
and instead to give the pupils a detached and connected description of 
historical events. 
The study of general history begins at the age of 11 to 12 (the study 
of Swedish history is continued), and is carried on according to the 
same principles as those for Swedish history. In the higher classes 
a thorough review is undertaken with the help of more detailed text- 
books than those used in the lower classes. In a few schools polities 
are also taught. 
The foreign languages taught are French, German, and English; 
in the schools preparing for the university Latin is also taught. The 
first foreign language, generally French, is begun at 8 years of age; 
the second, usually German, at 10; and the third, English, at 12. In 
the few schools where Latin occurs it is not studied until after the age 
of 16. There are modern pedagogues who vote for the precedence of 
the English language, as being the easiest from a grammatical point 
of view. Experiments have been made in this direction. Reading, 
grammar, translation, as well as speaking and writing, are taught. 
The question about the proper way of teaching languages has, at the 
present moment, awakened a most lively interest. The excessive study 
of grammar has been given up and practical methods are prevailing 
more and more. The aim and object of the instruction is that the 
pupil should acquire the ability to understand and speak the language 
taught. In several schools the instruction in question is given in the 
foreign language itself. Foreign languages are also the most favored 
subjects in the girls’ schools. A pupil learning the three modern lJan- 
guages devotes more than half of her compulsory time for homework 
to that study. At school the languages occupy more than 25 per cent 
of the time for instruction. 
Geographical instruction in the preparatory school has for its chief 
object to clear up geographical ideas by studying the map and learn- 
ing the geography of Sweden and of Scandinavia in general, thereby 
gaining a solid foundation for study. Then the other parts of the world 
are studied. By providing the school library with good and authentic 
books of travel, the interest of the pupils is awakened to the need of 
private study. In the highest classes astronomy is generally studied 
and there is detailed repetition of the geography of Sweden. 
The text books of late endeavor, as a rule, to do away with a super- 
fluity of names, to concentrate the Study of geography which the pupil 
then more unfailingly commits to memory. The new methods serve to 
connect with geography parts of natural history—for instance, botany, 
zoology, and mineralogy. .In some schools map drawing is taught. 
Zoology and botany generally begin in the second class (tenth year),
-P-A-G-E-24

and are taught during the next four years. In the higher classes physics 
as well as chemistry and geology are taught. In class 6 (fourteenth 
year) rules of health are imparted in connection with the study of 
anatomy, and in the highest class of many schools hygiene forms a 
special subject of study. In some schools domestic economy and chem- 
istry applied to household affairs are studied in the highest or in the 
finishing class (in the so-called continuation school), 
Since 1892 practical instruction in cooking has been imparted to the 
pupils in the continuation class of the State medel school, the teaching 
of which is carried on in a cooking school founded by Mrs. Anna Hierta- 
Retzius and placed at the disposal of the higher training college and 
the model school. Other schools in Stockholm and Géteborg also 
teach cooking. 
In spring and autumn botanical excursions are made. The duty of 
collecting a certain number of living plants during the summer holi- 
days is enjoined upon the pupils. The appliances for instruction vary 
according to the financial circumstances of the schools. 
Arithmetic begins in the preparatory school and is taught objectively 
by means of little balls. Great importance is attached to readiness in 
mechanical ciphering, which is brought about partly by mental arith- 
metic and partly by exercises written at school and at home. In class 
3 (eleventh year) the pupil should know the four rules of arithmetic 
properly. Then common and decimal fractions follow, with their appli- 
cation to interest, discount, division of profit and loss, ete. Special 
importance is attached to the learning of the metric system. In the 
continuation school algebra is taught, or an easy course of bookkeeping 
and economical arithmetic is gone through, by those who are going to 
devote themselves to practical professions. 
Geometry beginsinclass 5 with geometrical object lessons; theaim is to 
give a clear idea about lines, angles, surfaces, and geometrical figures. 
In classes 6 to 8 the three first books of Euclid are generally studied. 
Drawing is taught by copying diagrams, models, living plants, plas- 
ter casts, architectural and other ornament, and by drawing from life. 
The lessons in needlework aim to make the pupils skilled in such 
kinds of work as may be deemed necessary to every woman. Knitting, 
darning, patching, and plain needlework are compulsory; opportunity 
is also given to learn art needlework. In some schools wood sloyd 
aud dressmaking are taught. 
Of late great attention has been devoted to the hygienic conditions 
of schools. Jn the larger schools physicians are appointed, in part to 
superintend the hygienic conditions in general, in part to examine the 
state of health of the pupils and judge whether they may be admitted 
to gymnastics. The pupils are drilled every day in Ling’s gymnastics. 
In schools possessing a building of their own there is generally a gym- 
nasium provided, with apparatus and dressing room, where the pupils 
put on their gymnastic costumes.
-P-A-G-E-25
  
  EDUCATION IN SWEDEN AND ICELAND. 983 
Attention has been drawn to the danger of intellectual overexertion 
and attempts have been made to arrange school work so as to allow the 
pupils out of door exercise during the earlier part of the day. 
Instruction in girls’ schools is chiefly managed by women teachers. 
For the training of female teachers there are in Sweden five training 
colleges for female national school teachers and one higher training 
college, all founded by the State, and with instruction quite free of 
cost. Other female teachers have qualified for the university or for a 
bachelorship, or else, when teaching foreign languages, have perfected 
their education abroad. In the higher classes, male teachers from the 
boys’ higher schools sometimes give instruction by the hour. 
In smaller schools as well as in private teaching, similar methods are 
followed and the same subjects are studied as those mentioned above, 
with considerable modifications. 
THE PEOPLE’S HIGH SCHOOLS FOR WOMEN.! 
The pupils of these schools are grown-up girls, chiefly belonging to 
the farmers’ class. There is no entrance examination, neither is any 
stated preparatory knowledge required. As a rule, the pupils are pre- 
sumed to possess the standard of knowledge imparted in the national 
schools. 
‘The movement leading to this kind of school began in Denmark. 
The Swedish schools developed however independently. The first 
school for women of this class was founded in 1869; now there are 13. 
The object of the people’s high schools for women is to develop the 
mental faculties of the pupils, to make them comprehend true woman- 
liness and to excite an interest in subjects relating to general education 
and training in manual work. 
The people’s high school is no housekeeping school and does not want 
to be considered as chiefly aiming to impart such knowledge to the 
girls as exclusively belongs to the province of housework. The object 
in view is principally to develop the mental faculties of the girls as far 
as this can be attained by a knowledge of the language, history, and 
character of the native country, by acquaintance with the laws of 
nature, and by reading the best that our literature offers. In addition 
to this are held, especially at the Tiirna school, so-called free lectures 
on religio-ethical subjects. 
The school admits the importance of the rougher housework most 
women have to take part in, and for this reason attempts to organize 
the instruction so as to make the young girl acquainted with the nature 
of what surrounds her in daily life, as for instance the air, the water, 
the articles of food, etc., as well as to acquaint her with those laws 
which rule even in the most ordinary occupations of everyday life, so 
that she may be able to understand the reason why a thing is done in 
1 Reports from the Swedish Ladies’ Committee to the World’s Columbian Exposition, 1893, pp. 31-35.
-P-A-G-E-26
  984 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
such or such manner and so that she may be thoroughly trained for 
life’s duties. 
The subjects of study are: The Swedish language. The instruction 
aims to teach the pupils to read poetry and prose well; to understand 
properly the contents of what is read, and to express their thoughts in 
writing. Literature with recital of excellent excerpts in the evenings. 
History and geography. Free lectures on religio-ethical subjects. 
Hygiene, including the structure of the human body, the laws of health, 
general rules on the proper treatment of diseases, nursing of infants, 
ete. Knowledge of natural science, including some of the principles of 
_ chemistry and physics. In this connection housekeeping is studied, as 
for instance laundry, cleaning, boiling, roasting and frying, preserving, 
pickling, etc. French ironing is taught at several of the schools for 
women. Dairy training (the outlines). Arithmetic, domestic book- 
keeping, writing, singing, solo and part singing. Gymnastics are prac- 
ticed only at three people’s high schools for women, but gymnasiums 
are going to be built within a few years at many schools. 
By teaching needlework, the effort is to meet and encourage the girls 
to like female manual work (sloyd) and, at the same time, to develop 
taste and sound views within that sphere. The instruction in needle- 
work comprises mending and darning, various kinds of knitting and 
crochetwork, plain sewing and cutting, white, colored, and flat em- 
broidery, hemstitch and masking of several kinds, making of fringe 
and tassels, ete. 
For the second years’ pupils, as well as for those who have proved 
themselves clever in other kinds of needlework, there are lessons in 
lace-making and weaving of ancient Scanian textile fabrics for curtains, 
furniture stuffs, etc. The pupils must be quite expert in ordinary plain 
weaving to be taught art weaving at the school. 
To the development of their skill in manual work the school attaches 
great importance, and a stated plan is followed in the teaching of this 
subject. The pupils first must prove themselves skilled in mending, 
knitting, and plain needlework, then they are allowed to choose 
between the ornamental kinds of work. 
Time of instruction—All the people’s high schools for women are 
connected with those for male pupils, have the same head master, and 
are in the same localities. The Tiirna school has a head mistress of its 
own, however. While the course for. men is kept up during the six 
winter months, November—April, that for women covers the three sum- 
mer months, May-July, during which period the farmers are considered 
as most able to spare their young daughters. One female school (at 
Bollnis) is open during the three autumn months; one at (Fornby) dur- 
ing the four months, February-May, simultaneously with the school for 
men. Coeducation, as at the people’s high schools of Finland, is not 
customary in Sweden. The course for women is comparatively short, 
as the same teachers are employed for the summer and winter terms.
-P-A-G-E-27
EDUCATION IN SWEDEN AND ICELAND. 985 
Any pupil is welcome to remain for several consecutive terms, though 
far the greater number only go through one. Separate schools for 
women with a term of six winter months no longer exist. The morn- 
ing hours are in most of the schools devoted to study; the afternoon 
hours to needlework and singing. 
Mode of teaching.—The instruction is chiefly imparted by the teacher 
orally. The pupils are advised to study suitable text-books, by the help 
of which they can follow the teacher’s instruction. By means of ques- 
tions and repetitions, by conversation and written papers, the certainty 
is arrived at that what has been imparted has been well understood. 
As the pupils come to these schools with very different fundamental 
knowledge, the teacher tries to arrange his instruction so that all may 
profit by it. 
The school fee varies between 10 and 38 crowns ($2.68 and $10.28) a 
course. In some schools the fee is reduced for penniless pupils or else 
they get a free place. The second year’s pupils generally pay less than 
the first. Less well-to-do pupils are permitted to apply for scholar- 
ships, which are paid by the treasury and usually vary between 10 and 
50 crowns ($2.68 and $13.40). 
To have one household in common for the head master and the pupils, 
as is the case at the Danish people’s high schools, is not customary in 
Sweden. In some places, however, the pupils live in the school; at 
those of Tarna and of Tjérn a woman is engaged to cook the pupils’ 
own provisions for them. As a rule, the pupils lodge in the neighbor- 
ing peasant homes, where, as at Hyvilan for instance, they can board at 
arate of about 90 ére a day. The ordinary arrangement, though, is for 
the girls to bring provisions from home, which are cooked by their 
Jandlady for a small gratuity. This turns out to be the cheapest way. 
At Tiirna and Lunnevad the pupils live in the schoolhouse. 
Examinations —The people’s high school, not having as an object 
the qualifying of the pupils for any special employment, gives no testi- 
monial on leaving. The pupil can have at her own request a general 
statement concerning diligence, conduct, and standard of knowledge 
acquired. No examination is held on leaving school, this being deemed 
of no use, but rather apt to impair school work. During the short time 
allotted to school work attention is directed to the aims of life, not to a 
more or less successfulexamination. The school is always open to any- 
one wanting to obtain proof of the work done. Exhibitions of indus- 
trial art made by the pupils are arranged at the breaking up of the 
school. 
The school staff generally consists of male teachers, who also manage 
the people’s high school for men. The head master’s wife generally 
assists in the teaching. 
The people’s high school, being comparatively young and depending 
on individual efforts, has been an object of much misunderstanding and 
a good deal of criticism. Because of the short time allotted to it, 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
986 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
people have deemed it able to effect nothing but superficial work and to 
render the young farm girls dissimilar to their own class. The pupils 
find time to acquire an astonishing amount of knowledge in the short 
time given them; their diligence is so great that it rather needs keep- 
ing down than spurring on, and it is to be hoped that the impulse they 
get at school may be such as to serve them as a basis for the school 
of life. 
The school, always located in rural districts, does not remove them 
out of their ordinary conditions of life, which at school are quite as 
simple as al home. The people’s high school is striving, more than any 
other school, to be a home to its pupils—a large, good, loving home, 
where the most intimate intercourse of thought and feeling exists 
between teachers and pupils. The pupils generally like to spend most 
of their recreation time at the school. The country people of the 
neighborhood enjoy coming there to refresh themselves from their 
everyday toil by listening to the singing and the lectures. In this 
way the school becomes the center of its neighborhood. The country 
girl, when returning home, carries with her increased knowledge as 
well as increased practical abilities, and in addition a mind opened and 
made acceptable for wider views. 
Since the fourth decade of this century the higher education of 
women has been in a state of progress, and attempts have been made 
to raise the standard of female education. One party has been trying 
to make the instruction of girls. equal to that of the boys; another 
has attempted to create an independent form of female instruction; a 
third one, again, to bring about schools for coeducation by assimilating 
the standard of knowledge for boys and girls. 
SCHOOLS FOR COEDUCATION.! 
  The principle of coeducation has acquired many sincere friends, but 
still it can not be said as yet to have made any considerable progress 
in wider circles, though it is realized in the lower classes of the national 
school. The question about founding higher schools for eoeducation 
has, however, been discussed of late in the pedagogical periodicals ‘as 
well as at teachers’ meetings and at other conferences called together 
by persons taking an interest in the question. A few schools for coedu- 
eation have also been established by private individuals at Stockholm 
and at Upsala, and are working with good results. 
The oldest and largest is the Palmgren school in Stockholm (founded 
in 1876 by Mrs. A. Hierta-Retzius and by others interested in the ques- 
tion), which has developed under the guidance of the head master whose 
name it now bears. The school attaches great importance to sloyd, has 
a State subsidy, and may be said to have served as a model for the 
coeducational schools of Finland. Coeducation is carried on up to the 
    
1¥rom reports of Swedish Ladies’ Committee and Vor Ungdom.
-P-A-G-E-29

qualifying for the university. This school was founded in 1876, and 
has passed 21 pupils in the final examination.! 
In the Riksdag of 1893 a government. bill was presented whieh pro- 
posed to reorganize the boys’ schools of three classes, found in some 
smaller towns, into schools for coeducation, and where the instruction 
is to be imparted by male as well as female teachers. 
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION.” 
The State universities at Upsala and Lund have complete philosoph- 
ical, legal, medical, and theological faculties. The student is free to 
follow any course. Each faculty confers three degrees: Candidate, 
licentiate, and doctor; and itis stated that to be a lawyer, doctor, or 
elergyman in Sweden one must be a university graduate. The univer- 
sities are under the charge of a board of council, with the chancellor of 
the university as its chief officer. The academic year has two terms, 
from September 1 to December 15, and from January 1 to June 1. The 
salaries of professors range from $605 to $1,206, with the addition of 
tuition fees, which range from $265 to $402. 
The universities of Stockholm and Géteborg have only been in 
existence a short time, and it is conceded that before long they will 
pass from private initiative to the same rights, in matters of subsidies, 
examinations, etc., as the older universities. These new universities 
intend to admit special students, and their aim is to compete with the 
older universities ‘‘as centers of higher scientific teaching, and to make 
their instruction and resources accessible to wider circles of students.” 
Number of students in Upsala, 1,446 in 1894, and 638 at Lund; at 
Goteborg, 743 in 1893; at Stockholm, 160 in 1892. 
WOMEN IN THE UNIVERSITIES.’ 
The universities of Upsala and Lund were founded in 1477 and 1668, 
respectively, and from both women were excluded. It was not until 
the fourth decade of this century that a call arose for the abolition of 
this statute. At the Riksdag of 1865 a Swedish yeoman, Carl Johann 
Svensen, presented a bill for the admission of women to the universities. 
This bill occasioned a lively debate. The one side pronounced women 
to be Jacking in both the physical and practical power requisite for 
earrying on higher studies; the other side showed how unreasonable it 
was to form a decided opinion on that question when no opportunity 
had been given woman to try the power of herintellect. Her fitness for 
the professions of teacher and physician was specially put forth. The 
result of the debate was a petition for the intervention of Government, 
1 Phe Palmgren Practical Work School aims to train both sexes in those studies which lead to prac- 
tical life. There is no special limit as to the elementary or secondary charaeter of the school, nor as 
to the age of applicants for admission. (See pp. 433-434 of the Report of the Commissioner of 
Education for 1801-92; also Palmgrenska Samskolan: Stockholm.) 
2 This subject was so fully treated on pp. 434-436 of the Report of the Commissioner of Fducation 
for 1891-92 that a mero résumé is here given.

demanding for women the right to pass the examinations prescribed 
by the law for becoming teachers and physicians. 
On the 3d of June, 1870, a writ was issued, conferring upon woman 
the right of passing the examination for the university, of matriculat- 
ing at the universities, and of following the profession of a physician. 
Since that time the number of female students has been increasing 
year by year. This number, however, only comes up to about 1 per 
cent of that of the male students, but these, in proportion to the popu- 
lation, are too numerous. 
During the first years the young ladies passed their examinations at 
some boys’ school, but since 1875 the right of qualifying for the univer- 
' sity has been conferred upon girls’ schools also. At the present mo- 
ment there are at least five schools that prepare female pupils for this 
examination. 
The examination for the university is passed either in the classical 
division or in the mathematical division. The classical division com- 
prises the following compulsory subjects of examination: Swedish com- 
position, theology, Latin, French, German, mathematics and. physics, 
history and geography, zoology and botany, and propedeuties of phi- 
losophy. Optional subjects are: Greek, Hebrew, and English, one of 
which is obligatory. 
In the mathematical division classical languages are not studied, but 
the claims on knowledge in the three modern languages, German, 
French, and English, in mathematics, and in physics are greater than 
in the classical department, and, besides, chemistry has to be studied. 
‘Most of the women have passed their examination in the classical 
department. Of the young ladies who have passed the examination 
for the university only about 38 per cent have matriculated at the uni- 
versities. Some have gone back into private life and some have found 
employment as post, railway, or bank officials, or else as teachers. 
The theological faculty in the universities is not open to women. 
In the faculty of jurisprudence there are several examinations, out 
of which the one for a ‘‘candidatus juris utriusque” is the principal of 
those most commonly taken. It requires about five years’ hard study. 
This examination has been passed by one lady. 
The course of study in the medical faculty extends over seven to 
nine years from the time of matriculation. Two ladies have finished 
their medical studies and are practicing as physicians; a considerable 
number of women are studying medicine. The medical faculty in 
Stockholm is opened also to women, and follows the same rules for the 
examinations. 
The philosophical faculty is divided into a philological and a mathe- 
matical section. 
The examinations within both these sections are: 
(1) Baccalaureate, requiring several compulsory subjects arranged 
in different groups. 
   
-P-A-G-E-31
  
EDUCATION IN SWEDEN AND ICELAND. 989 
(2) Licentiate, a scientific examination comprising one principal sub- 
ject and two secondary ones. 
A licentiate, after having written a scientific dissertation and success- 
fully defended it against opponents chosen by the university, is created 
doctor of philosophy, with ceremonies which have been in practice for 
hundreds of years. The baccalaureate, with certain compulsory sub- 
jects, and followed by one year’s teaching at one of the State schools, - 
qualifies for minor tutorship at these schools. 
The licentiate entitles to tutors’ higher appointments, About 23 
women have passed the baccalaureate, while only one woman has passed 
for the licentiate, receiving the degree of Ph. D. in 1883. Several 
women have studied in the philosophical faculty, but, without passing 
the examination, have applied themselves to scientific works later on. 
This has been the case with those studying zoology and botany in the ~ 
faculty of sciences in Stockholm, which, founded in 1878, has, like the 
faculty of philosophy and philology at Géteborg (founded in 1890), 
opened its lecture halls to women. 
It may be stated here that, although permitted to become a practicing 
" physician, a woman can not hold any Government office in this capacity. 
The question whether a woman may become alawyer is still unsettled. 
In 1892 the first Swedish woman graduate at law finished her theoreti- 
cal studies, but is still pursuing the prescribed practical part of her 
juridical studies in a district court. She aspires to be admitted as an 
attorney, but may not become a judge. 
TECHNICAL AND SLOYD TRAINING. 
This subject has been so fully treated in the Report of the Commis- 
sioner of Education for 1891-92 (pp. 427-429, 437-440) that no further 
elucidation seems necessary. It may be stated, however, that in 1892 
about 4,775 men and 1,306 women were receiving technical instruction 
of some kind, while sloyd was taught in about 1,400 schools. The 
number of schools receiving aid from the State for sloyd since 1884 are 
enumerated in the Slojdundervisningsblad, No. 12, 1895, as follows: In 
1884 there were 584; in 1885, 727; in 1886, 872; in 1887, 991, to 1,167 in 
1888; increase to 1,278 in 1889, to 1,392 in 1890; still further increase to 
1,492 in 1891, to 1,624 in 1892; thence to 1,787 in 1893 and 1,895 in 1894, 
Thus the needs or benefits of sloyd training seem to be thoroughly 
understood in this division of Scandinavia. 
DAIRY, AGRICULTURAL, AND HORTICULTURAL SCHOOLS. 
The Government and agricultural societies aid 25 agricultural 
schools, which aim to give practical education to young men so that 
they may carry on farms of their own. Dairy schools (2) and dairy 
stations (18) give regular instruction in dairying, and similar courses 
are carried on in connection with the agricultural societies. The  
-P-A-G-E-32
  
  990 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
standard of education is that of the elementary school; the theoretical 
instruction includes writing, arithmetic, also bookkeeping; practical 
instruction includes domestic work about the household as well as 
dairying. 
A horticultural school at Norrviken opened in 1590, is coeducational 
in character. It is the only school of its kind in Sweden, and in a two 
years’ course trains in the practical management of a garden and in 
floriculture. 
COOKING AND HOUSEKEEPING SCHOOLS.! 
In Sweden it is only exceptionally that cooking and domestic work are 
taught at the girls’ schools.’ To supply this deficiency in the education 
of the young ladies, several families send their daughters, after having 
finished school, to a housekeeping school in the country, where they 
spend from six to twelve months. 
The housekeeping school at Bjérnsniis for the education of house- 
wives, receives boarders from the age of 16, and teaches cooking, the 
principles of housekeeping, practically and theoretically, preserving, 
baking, salting and curing, washing and ironing, cleaning, weaving, 
art needlework, ete. The annual time of instruction comprises an 
autumn term, from August 15 to December 15, and aspring term, from 
January 15 to June 15. The annual fee is 750 crowns ($201). 
Other provincial housekeeping schools, established on the same prin- 
ciples, are the practical school at Samuelsberg for teaching young ladies 
housekeeping and manual work; Miss Ellen Mdller’s housekeeping 
school for young girls; the Alingsids school of languages and domestic 
work, which, besides imparting instruction in household work, offers an 
opportunity of learning modern languages, etc. 
In Stockholm there are also several housekeeping schools, where the 
young girls, while living at home, are taught housekeeping during 
some hours’ daily attendance. Such is (1) the new housekeeping school, 
which teaches educated young ladies the theory and practice of plain 
or more elaborate cooking, preserving fruit and vegetables, ironing, and 
other domestic occupations; it thus enables them in a practical way to 
manage a house. Each course comprises a time of four and one-half 
months. A limited number of pupils are admitted to each course. To 
those who have attended three months at least a testimonial is given. 
The pupils assemble every week day at 8 a. m., and the work is kept up 
till4or5 p.m. The fee is 225 crowns ($60) for a completecourse. For 
a shorter time, 60 crowns ($16) a month. (2) The Stockholm cooking 
school, founded in 1882°by Mrs. Anna Hierta-Retzius with a grant of 
5,000 crowns ($1,340) from the foundation of “In Memoriam of Lars 
Hierta,” is the first school in Sweden where cooking solely (with baking

Athenwum for girls.

and preserving) was taught with the exclusion of other housework. 
For this reason, the course has since the very beginning been limited 
to-three months only. In this cooking school, the physiology of nutri- 
tion and domestic economy are first theoretically taught by means of 
lectures on those subjects. The pupils are also trained in marketing 
under the teacher’s guidance. Those who have passed a complete 
course obtain atestimonial, Thefood is served a la carte to ladies and 
gentlemen taking their dinners at the school (from 2 to 4.30 p. m.). 
The original object of this school was to introduce cooking as a sub- 
ject of information among the daughters of the working classes, to 
qualify them for housework in their own homes after having passed 
through the national school, During the first three years the fee was 
10 crowns ($2.68) a month (and dinner free of charge), but was later 
increased to 20 crowns (85.36) a month, and, to make the school self- 
supporting, admission was granted, with a double fee, to two or three 
married or unmarried young ladies of the cultured classes, who, up to 
that time, had no opportunity of learning in so short a time. For 
ladies engaged to be married a shorter course (of six weeks) was 
arranged. 
Finally, cookery teachers have been trained at this school, to facili- 
‘tate the introduction in future of cooking as a subject of education in 
the national schools. 
In September, 1892, instruction in cooking and domestic economy 
having been introduced as a subject of information at the higher train- 
ing college, Mrs. Hierta-Retzius’s Cooking School was made over to the 
board of the above-mentioned college, the founder, however, having 
undertaken to guarantee the school funds. 
Cooking at .a national school was first taught in 1889 at the parish of 
St. Nicholas, in Stockholm, the information on this subject being intro- 
duced on the initiative of Mrs. Sofi Nilsson, a national school teacher, 
who during many years’ work had realized the necessity of raising the 
standard of practical work. 
The school board having agreed to fit up a kitchen in one of the 
schoolhouses, five to six girls from the highest class were allowed to 
leave their school work at 10 a. m.in order to learn to cook the food 
gratuitously distributed to their younger schoolfellows. 
On the initiative of Mrs. Hierta-Retzius and by means of an endow- 
ment from the foundation of “In Memoriam of Lars Hierta,” a national 
school teacher, Miss Brolinsson, was sent to London to attend “The 
National Training School of Cookery” in South Kensington, and to 
study cooking as it is taught in the board schools in London. 
On her return the cooking school of St. Mary was founded, partly 
after the English plan, where a course was given to future cookery 
teachers. These women, who had previously passed a practical free 
course at Mrs. Retzius’ cooking school and had practiced as cookery 
teachers in the school -kitchen of St. Mary, passed an examination,

received a certificate, and have since obtained employments as man- 
agers or assistants at cooking schools in Stockholm, Géteborg, and 
Vesteras. 
Tn four of the Stockholm national schools, those of St. Nicholas, St. 
Clara, St. Mary, and Hedvig Eleonora, the girls in the highest classes, 
generally to the number of thirty from each school, have.been taught 
cooking and baking and have undertaken by turns to carry out such 
work. The girls, who do the washing up, the house cleaning, etc., seem 
to keep up a lively interest in the matter, and many opinions expressed 
in the children’s homes show that the parents also duly appreciate the 
instruction given. One thing strictly impressed upon the children is 
the necessity of cleanliness, order, and economy. 
The ingredients of the various dishes, the cost, and the method of 
preparation are written down by the girls in special books. The quan- 
tity and price are, as a rule, calculated for six people. Thus, when 
finishing school, the girls bring home with them a little cookery book 
made by themselves and containing receipts tried by them and com- 
prising the dishes mostly used in ordinary, simple houses. The expenses 
for these cooking schools are defrayed partly by private people, partly 
by the respective parishes. 
The teaching of this subject having begun to gain more sympathy 
in the national schools of the capital, the following general rules have 
been established and are to be enforced from the beginning of 1892: 
(1) The girls who take part in the work at the cooking school are 
divided into groups of four to six each; (2) these groups are selected. 
out of the two highest girls’ classes of the school: (3) the girls who 
during their school time have taken a share in the cooking work will 
be allowed to continue it for one term after having left school; (4) no 
more than three groups (exceptionally and for special reasons, four) are 
selected out of each school class; (5) each group has instruction for 
two consecutive days in cooking; (6) after the groups from one class in 
school have in turn attended the cooking school, four days at least 
must elapse before they begin again (during the interval, groups from 
the other class are taught); (7) school girls belonging to the cooking 
school must, before going there, attend the first two lessons of the day 
(from 8 to 10). 
In 1870 a practical housekeeping school was inaugurated in Stock- 
holm, which served as a model school for those since created in Upsala, 
Goteborg, Lund, etc. Opening with six pupils some 200 girls (in 1891) 
had received three years’ practical training. Pupils are received at 16 
years of age, “if of good disposition;” they learn the duties of laun- 
dress, waitress, chambermaid, and have instruction ‘in finer cooking.” 
In 1879 the school established a shop of its own for the sale of bread, 
cake, etc., and in 1881 established a store for cooked provisions. The 
mending of garments is taught one afternoon each week, and there is 
regular instruction in the sewing room,

FRESH-AIR FUND COLONIES. 
As will be observed, the Swedes give practical training of many 
kinds to their youth, and they do not neglect the “weak and sickly 
children” nor the hygienic side of education.! 
In 1885 the Society of the Fresh-Air Fund was established in Stock- 
holm, its object being to provide summer homes in the country for 
weak and sickly school children, especially from the public schools of 
Stockholm. From that date to 1891 there were 148 colonies sent out, 
which ineluded 3,352 children. The number in a colony is usually lim- 
ited to 25, 
As the principal objects of the sojourn are rest and opportunity to 
be in the fresh air as much as possible, all school work is forbidden, 
but the children are not idle in consequence. The girls have to keep 
the rooms in order, set the table, assist in the kitchen; the boys keep 
the yard and vicinity of the house in good order, carry water and wood, 
carry the mail, ete. The children have to keep their clothing in order 
also, under the direction of the matron of the colony or her assistant. 
The regular life, where strictness with regard to order, cleanliness, and 
good conduct is the governing principle, has proved most successful in 
the moral development of the children in the colony homes, and agree- 
able changes in their behavior after their return to the city have been 
recognized by their teachers and parents. 
The result of the colony life, from a sanitary point of view, is consid- 
ered by physicians to be especially successful. The examination of 58 
children of an average age of 10 years, who had been in two separate 
colonies in 1891, showed that “‘the boys gained 1.03 kilograms in weight, 
1.3 centimeters in height, and 8 centimeters in breadth of chest, while 
the girls gained 1.19 kilograms in weight, 1.7 centimeters in height, and 
1 centimeter in breadth of chest. The painful and dull expression and 
the weak, shuffling motions which were observed at the beginning of the 
outing disappear during the two months’ visit in the country, and 
the bright, happy faces, the clear and frank gaze, the healthy appear- 
ance and lively movements, all witness to the benefit gained, not only 
for a short summer but doubtless for life.” 
The Woman’s Union in Géteborg sent out 181 colonists in 1891, and 
the cities of Norrkjéping and Gefle are also sending out summer colonies 
of school children. 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The seventh meeting of the Scandinavian School Congress (Sjiinde 
Allmianna Nordiska Skolmétet) was held in Stockholm, August 6-8, 
1895. This congress meets every five years at one of the three Scandi- 
navian capitals. In attendance were nearly 7,000 teachers; 3,700 from

Sweden, 1,200 from Norway, 1,500 from Denmark, and 300 from Finland, 
During the three-day’s session about fifty papers were read and dis- 
cussed, inteygst in them being shown by educators and also by the 
authorities. The minister of public instruction, Mr. Gilljam, took part 
in the meetings which were presided over by prefect Themptander. 
The subjects awakening the most earnest discussions were, religious 
education in the school, historical instruction, and the peace movement. 
Papers were also read on the peasant high schools, on university exten- 
sion, the Swedish school system, sloyd instruction, etc. The social 
pleasures attendant upon this congress were a special feature of the 
occasion, and the fraternal feeling between the countries seemed 
strengthened by this congress. 
An historical presentation of the peasants’ high schools—the first 
haying been established in Rodding, Denmark, in 1844—was given, and 
due honor was done to N. F. 8. Grundtvig, who is considered their 
founder. The strong development of the Real school, with its prac- 
tical training for life’s duties, was clearly brought out. The absolute 
need of thoroughness in the mother tongue before other languages are 
studied was discussed, also the study of phonetics. Physical education 
awakened interest; stress was laid upon the necessity of the teacher’s 
knowledge of his pupils’ organization, or injury, instead ofimprovement, 
might result from overtraining. Reform methods in different grades of 
schools were presented, the desire being to prevent overburdening of 
mind with its natural reaction upon the body. Hygienic and sanitary 
methods were discussed from the standpoint of the teachers present from 
the three countries. In the matter of reform spelling and phonetics, 
the pioneers of this phase of education in different countries were 
referred to, and those teachers taking part in the discussions recognized 
the fact that changes might be made which would be benefiicial to people 
of various nationalities (Vor Ungdom, 1895, Hefte 1-6).

AREA AND POPULATION, 
Ethnologieally and politically considered Iceland is an integral part 
of Scandinavia, that group of kindred countries usually called the 
North (Norden) by their own peoples. The countries so designated 
are the “United Kingdoms” (De forenede Riger), Sweden and Norway, 
1Prepared by Miss Frances Graham French, specialist in the school systems of northern and 
eastern Europe.

and Denmark, whose chief dependency, Iceland, is 39,200 square miles 
in area, or 7,000 more than that of Ireland. The greatest length of the 
island is 300 miles from east to west, and its greatest breadth 201 miles. 
It is supposed that the population of Iceland was once 100,000, but 
it subsequently diminished. Since 1840, when it amounted to 57,094, a 
gradual increase has taken place, until, in 1880, it had reached 72,000. 
The chief town is Reykjavik, with about 2,500 inhabitants. 
ADMINISTRATION.! 
Formerly Iceland was divided into four quarters—the east, south, 
west, and north. Now the north and the east are united under one 
government and the south and the west under another. 
The island is further divided into 18 counties (syslu), and tWese 
again into 169 rapes” (hreppa) or poor law districts. Ecclesiastically 
Iceland constitutes one bishopric, divided into 20 deaneries, and these 
again into 290 parishes. Iceland has its own constitution and adminis- 
tration under a charter which came into force August 1, 1874. By the 
terms of this charter the legislative power is vested in the “‘Althing,” 
consisting of 36 members, 30 elected by popular suffrage and 6 nom- 
inated by the King. A minister for Iceland, nominated by the King, 
resides at Copenhagen, but is at the head of the administration. He 
submits to the King for confirmation the legislative measures proposed 
by the Althing. It may here be said that the language, laws, and tra- 
ditions of Iceland are quite distinct from those of Denmark, and its 
position so remote that there might seem to be difficulties in governing 
it properly as an integral part of the Danish Kingdom. 
The highest local authority is vested in the governor-general, who 
resides at Reykjavik. : 
He carries on the Government according to the views of the minister 
at Copenhagen. 
The governor-general (Landshéféingi) has two aids (or under-govern- 
ors), one for the south and west, another for the north and east. Then 
there are the sheriffs (syslumenn), who act as tax gatherers, and nota- 
ries public. The “syslu-madr” has an assistant or “hreppstjori,” in 
every poor law district. In such district there are also committees of 
from three to five members who administer the poor laws and look after 
the general affairs. These committees are controlled by the committees 
of the county boards, and these again by the quarter board of three 
members. The State church is Lutheran, and all Icelanders, without 
exception, belong to it. 
HISTORY. 
Notwithstanding its isolated situation, its few natural advantages 
and sparse population Iceland is of great interest to historian, philolo- 
gist, and littérateur.

The historian is delighted with the exactitude of its historical records 
and the strange phases of life to which they bear witness, and the 
singular circumstances which have determined the existence and life of 
the Teutonic community for a thousand years apart from the rest of the 
European family. 
The philologist looks upon the island as the home of a language 
which most nearly represents in a living form the tongue of our earliest 
Teutonic forefathers. Others believe that Iceland had a brilliant period 
of intellectual life long before the literary eras of England and Ger- 
many, and a literature superior to any north of the Alps before the 
Renaissance. 
The historical phase is the only one we can touch upon here, as the 
préSent conditions are an outcome of the past. 
The unit of Icelandic administration was the homestead, with its 
franklin’ owner (“biiandi”), its primal organization, the hundred-moot 
(“thing”), its tie the chieftainship (“g66r5”). The chiefs who led 
kinsmen~to a new land held considerable power, and at first there 
was no higher organization; but disputes, uncertainties as to laws, ete., 
brought about the constitution of Ulfliot (in 930). Through this a cen- 
tral moot or “‘Althing” was created for the whole island, and ‘a speaker 
to speak a single law”? (principally that followed by the ‘ gula”-moot in 
Norway). In 964 the reforms of Thord Gellir fixed a certain number of 
local moots and chieftaincies, dividing the island into four quarters, to 
each of which a head-court or quarter-court was assigned. Ecclesias- 
tical innovations (Christianity was introduced in 1000) caused upheay- 
als, eventually putting an end to the commonwealth, which had 
produced men of mark and encouraged progress. The practical rule 
of Iceland was transferred by the union of the three crowns to Den- 
mark in 1280; it had formerly been under Norwegian viceroys and Nor- 
wegian law; the island then received a foreign governor (Earl, Hird- 
stjori or Stiftamstmadr) and was divided into local counties (syslu), 
administered by sheriffs (sfslumenn); local affairs were attended to by 
the bailiff (hreppstjéri) and the quarter-courts were abolished. 
The ideas agitating Europe percolated through Scandinavia to 
Iceland and successful efforts were made to educate the peasant class, 
who were about all that were left after the cruel wars of the thirteenth 
century had broken down the great houses which had monopolized the 
chieftaincies. The “ Althing” had existed for fully nine hundred years, 
but sometimes as a mere council of powerless delegates. It was sup- 
pressed but reorganized in 1843, Thirty years’ agitation brought about 
home rulé in 1874, The absolutism of the sheriffs and the governor 
was réplaced by officials assisted by elected boards. The government 
may be said to have been at first hierarchic and aristocratic; afterwards 
it became a kind of aristocratic republic.

EDUCATION IN SWEDEN AND ICELAND. DOr 
GENERAL CONDITIONS, 
Two peculiar conditions exist in Iceland; these are the absence of 
towns and the equality of society in a sense which exists in no other 
European country. The priest, who has the title “sira,” enjoys certain 
rank and distinction; but even the governor, with his office of power 
and dignity, is liable to be accosted familiarly by farmer or fisherman. 
The people are distinguished for honesty, purity of morals, and a 
wonderful love of education. Notwithstanding their poverty and other 
adverse circumstances, it is rare to find an Icelander who can not read 
aud write. 
At Reykjavik is the governor’s residence; the “Althing,” which 
once met in the valley at Thingvalla, meets here; the bishop has his 
home here; there is an observatory, a public library of 10,000 volumes, 
and Reykjavik is the seat of an Icelandic society established in 1794, 
Three newspapers are printed here, and since 1530 (when the first print- 
ing press was set up by Mathieson, a Swede) books, original and trans- 
lated, have been annually printed in Icelandic. The translations have 
included portions of Milton’s Paradise Lost, Shakespeare, Pope, and 
Cowper. 
As for the language, as a genuine living dialect, spoken and written 
and even printed in newspapers of the present, Icelandic may claim to 
be the oldest in Europe. The Romaic has dropped many cases and 
tenses; Danish and Swedish are modernized and simplified dialects, 
while Icelandic retains the archaic forms of the ancient Scandinavian 
tongue once in use throughout northern Europe. 
The literature reflects and perpetuates the beliefs and manners of the 
people through successive generations. Both language and literature 
are of historical and living interest to scholar and statesmen. Ice- 
landic literature has always been much studied by the people and 
written in popular idiom; it has preserved the ancient language almost 
unchanged and hence is an isolated survivor of a bygone historical 
period. 
GENERAL FEATURES OF EDUCATION. 
Considering the extent of country, the sparseness of population, and 
the difficulties of intercommunication, the diffusion of knowledge seems 
astonishing, even to those familiar with the history of this island. In 
Reykjavik, and among the clergy in general, men of high literary cul- 
ture are to be found, some of them scholars who would do credit to any 
seat of learning in Europe. A child of 10 who is unable to read is not 
to be found from one end of the island to the other. A peasant under- 
standing several languages is no rarity, and the amount of general in- 
formation is quite noticeable. Formerly all children were taught by 
their parents or neighbors ; now a few elementary schools have been 
started ; classical and general studies are found at a college in Reyk- 
javik, which has about one hundred students and seven professors.
-P-A-G-E-40
998 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
. The general physician of the island, assisted by two medical men, gives 
lectures to medical students. Those who propose to enter upon a 
course of law have to attend the University at Copenhagen. There is 
also a flourishing academy in Médruvellir, in the north of Iceland ; an 
agricultural college at Olafefjord. The island also supports four semi- 
naries for young women, the first one having been established in Reyk- 
javik in 1876. Iceland has always been a land of learned men, and to 
this day erudite Icelanders may be found in almost every university 
of Europe; in no country is a scholar held in more esteem; yet it is 
stated that the Icelandic student devotes himself more exclusively to 
languages and literature, to the neglect of science and mathematics. 
In 1886 a limited suffrage was granted to women, permitting them to 
vote in the selection of clergy for the parishes. In the same year 
women were admitted as students in the higher institutions of learning. 
Owing to the difficulties attendant upon obtaining any very precise 
information regarding education in Iceland, a letter was sent, in the 
autumn of 1895, to the governor-general requesting more specific data. 
The reply of His Excellency Magnus Stephensen, the governor-gen- 
eral of Iceland, is here incorporated. He says: 
In reply to your letter of the 18th September, I have much pleasure in sending 
you the following notes on education in Iceland. As the bulk of the population is 
scattered over the country in isolated farmhouses, with long distances between 
them, schools are impracticable in the rural districts, and the children receive the 
rudiments of learning from their parents or any other qualified member of the 
household. This instruction is superintended by the clergyman of the parish, whose 
duty it is to examine candidates for confirmation, not only as to their religious 
knowledge, but also as to their proficiency in reading, writing, and the first rules 
cf arithmetic, and to refuse or postpone that rite until the children have acquired 
the necessary knowledge. Of late years a system of ‘circuit teachers” has been 
organized and is in operation in many country districts. These teachers travel 
from place to place during the winter, remaining for several weeks at each centrally 
situated farmhouse and teaching the children from all the surrounding farms 
within reach. They are supported by the people of their districts, and receive a 
small grant from the Icelandic treasury. In 1894 these circuit teachers numbered 
165, and they taught 3,280 children, the subjects being reading, writing, orthogra- 
phy, arithmetic, and religious instruction. 
In the towns, trading stations, and fishing villages there are 26 children’s schools, 
which in 1894 were attended by 826 children. These schools are open in the winter 
time for six to eight and a half months, and have generally one, but sometimes two, 
teachers. The subjects taught are reading, writing, orthography, arithmetic, 
religious knowledge, geography, the rudiments of natural science, and Icelandic 
grammar. Some schools in addition to these teach history, Danish, English, singing, 
gymnastics, and swimming. All these schools are locally supported, receiving in 
addition grants from the treasury. 
The higher and specialized schools are three schools for women, where the higher 
branches of education, needlework, and housekeeping are taught; two “Real_ 
schools,” one at Médruvellir, supported entirely by the Government, with three 
teachers; the other, called ‘‘Flensborg school,” is supported by private endowment 
and Government grant, and serves also during part of the year as a seminary for 
teachers; ono Latin school or high school in Reykjavik, with seven masters, besides 
assistants, and 115 pupils last year; four agricultural schools, and one nautical school. 
There is also a school for the deaf and dumb. 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  EDUCATION IN SWEDEN AND ICELAND. go 
The professional schools are a theological seminary and a school of medicine, cach 
with four teachers, both situated in Reykjavik. 
Tuition is free in all the higher schools; most of them provide free lodging for 
their pupils, and bursaries are attached to some. 
. METHODS OF EDUCATION. 
Iceland furnishes a singular example of a country which has almost no 
primary schools, and yet primary education is universal. The pastors 
refuse to give illiterates in marriage, and these are rarely to be found. 
The mothers teach their children reading, writing, and arithmetic.! 
At 7 years of age [says an Icelander] all children know how to read and write 
their language, and they know how to reckon, Even among the poor fishermen there 
are none who have not had a good elementary education. The mothers are the instruct- 
ors; the rural home (boer) is the schoolroom. The nearest clergyman watches over 
the progress of the children, and the child who does not indicate sufficient knowledge 
for his, years and the instruction given is refused confirmation. The mother of the 
family would die of chagrin if such were the case; hence she makes all effort to suit- 
ably prepare the child. Ask the first child whom you meet who taught him the his- 
tory and geography of the country, the names of birds and flowers; his answer is 
invariably, my mother (modre min). Each house is in itself a school of intellectual, 
religious, and industrial training, after a crude fashion. The long winter evenings 
are givon to reading, to traditional lore, to indoor occupation, by which every child 
is trained to such handicrafts as the necessities of their position require—making 
fishing tackle, boats, casks, sails, ete.—and the women to knitting, and working up 
moss, skins, feathers, and eider down into marketable and domestic use. Every 
able-bcdied adult can do something for a livelihood, and the highest dignitary of 
Iceland, judge, governor, or bishop, can, if occasion requires, shoe his own horse and 
_ repair his own boat and tackle or land vehicle and harness. 
The landed proprietors are responsible not only for the education of their own 
children, but those of their servants and of the families who are their tenants. The 
clergymen and their aids are expected to observe what progress has been made at 
least twice a year. 
STUDIES PURSUED. 
In a few towns on the coast there exist a number of villages which 
have primary schools. According to terms of the law the course of 
study includes moral and religious education, national history, reading, 
writing, and arithmetic. 
At Reykjavik there is a gymnasium with 100 pupils, faculties of 
theology, medicine, and law; at Médruvellir a school of agriculture, a 
course of study covering agriculture, Icelandic, Danish, and English ~ 
languages, geography, history, physics, chemistry, and mineralogy. 
The impression seems to be gaining ground that in this little country 
of the far North the learned men are taking a firm stand in regard to 
the carrying on of higher studies, and even now the humanities are 
thoroughly comprehended.

UNIVERSITY EDUCATION.! 
At the close of the session of the ‘“Althing” in 1893 thirty members 
formed themselves into a committee to inaugurate a national movement 
contemplating the founding of a university in Iceland. The committee 
considers that such an. institution would be of material benefit to the 
country and will add greatly to its moral and intellectual culture. A 
subcommittee has charge of this effort to establish a university and to 
take up a subscription in Iceland for that purpose. They hope before 
long to place funds provisionally in the hands of professors of the law 
school of Iceland whilst awaiting the decision of the King of Denmark 
that the university may be opened.

  The report of this Office for 1893-94 contained a series of tables? showing, as fully 
as possible, the extent of the introduction of hand training in institutions of all 
rades in the United States, the intention being to include all organized instruction 
ing in view preparation for industrial pursuits requiring training of the hand. 
This chapter is intended to supplement those tables by showing the 4 purposes and 
character of the instruction—matters which are not susceptible of statistical pres- 
entation. 
It is impossible to represent every institution in such a compilation, but it has 
been intended to set forth as far as possible the aims and methods of typical institu- 
tions in sufficient numbers to show all the phases of industrial education in this 
country in institutions below the collegiate grade. 
In seeking the data required, a circular letter was addressed to all institutions 
concerned, in which information was asked upon the following points:

paratory to higher technical study, or with a direct view to actual work or a trade; 
extent to which manual (or industrial) training is obligatory. 
(2) Organization: Connection with public schools or other institutions; means of 
supports: amount charged for tuition.

those documents were furnished in lieu of or to supplement specially prepared state-

Dr. C. M. Woodward, on The Rise and Progress of Manual Training, which was 
published in the report of this Office for 1893-94, pages 877-949. But little spa 
therefore, is given tc those phases of the subject in the following compilation. 
    I—CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
  MANUAL TRAIN. 
  NG Hien Scnoor, DENVER, CoLo. 
     om the catalogue of 1896.] 
The purpose of this school is to furnish a liberal elementary education, suitable 
not only for those who contemplate a higher education later, but especially for those 
pupils who upon leaving school must enter at once upon the active duties of 
The course of study gives ample preparation to meef the requirements for entr: 
to colleges and technical schools, except to college departments requiring prepa 
tion in Greek. 
The purpose of manual training is just as truly educational as is that of purely 
mental training. Asa part of public school work it must therefore be broad and 
liberal in its scope and universal in its applications. 
The shop exercises are carefully planned to embody many constructive principles 
and to bring into use, one after another, all of the more common and typical tools 
of modern handicraft. ‘ 
The articles mado in the shops are not offered for sale, and indeed seldom have any 
intrinsic value, save as illustrations of certain forms and principles. 
Since the whole object of this training is educational in character, the student, as 
soon as he has mastered the principle or process involved in a certain exercise, is set 
to work upon another. Mere mechanical dexterity is regarded as of secondary 
importance; thorough mastery of principles, comprehension of the logical steps of 
the process, together with intelligent execution of the same is all that we demand. 
Further repetition would doubtless resultin greater mechanical dexterity, but as 4n 
educational process it would be lacking in mental training. Movements that have 
become automatic, that is, which no longer require the active supervision of the 
mind, can not be regarded as highly educational in character. When this point is 
reached, therefore, it is time for the student to drop that particular exercise and turn 
to something else. 
Notice that we said, “intelligent” exeeution of the exercise is demanded. This is 
the key to the whole plan. Students must know how to do certain things, and also 
why certain processes are employed. They do not blindly copy a piece of work, but 
trace the logical steps of a process to its legitimate result. 
This kind of training-can not, fail to make thoughtful, intelligent workers; and 
who will deny that we need more of these in the world? 
It is unreasonable to expect that all of our graduates will become mechanics. 
Some of them doubtless will, and we confidently expect a good account of them. 
Others will find that their natural abilities lead them in other directions, and they 
will turn aside into business channels, or push onward through the higher technical 
school or college toward the professions, such as tho law, medicine, engineering, and. 
the various occupations requiring extended scientific training. It is predicted with 
entire confidence, however, that each and every student will be benefited and 
strengthened by his manual training work. He will go forth into the world with 
a mental training, the vigor and practical worth of which could not have been 
obtained in any other way than by personal contact with tools and materials. 
It will be observed that while no specific trades are taught, we do teach the under- 
lying mechanical principles of a great many trades; and that the possible economic 
applications of these acquired principles is almost limitless in number. 
Each pupil will be helped by his school work to discover his natural capabilities 
and aptitudes, and to make an intelligent choice of occupation. 
Visitors to the school sometimes carry away a false impression of its character, 
because the manual training departments from their novelty attract an undue amount

of their attention. It must be borne in mind that manual training work, although _ 
important, is not intended to supersede legitimate literary work. It will be found 
upon investigation that the academic work required of pupils in this school is supe- 
rior in character. An outline of each year’s work will be found herein. 
It will also be found that the manual training high school is no asylum for lazy 
boys and girls; on the contrary, they will be as sadly out of place here as in any other 
place where activity and industry is demanded 
Tho object of manual training, as introduced into the public schools, is to develop 
the faculties through the education of the hand and eye; to familiarize the pupil 
with tools, materials, and processes, to cultivate habits of thoughtful, intelligent, 
and accurate work, and thus to bring into close relationship, knowing and doing.

From the above, with the approval of the principal, the student chooses 30 hours’ 
work per week, at least 13 of which must be chosen from the. following lines of 
work: Mathematics, science, history, language. The manual work is required of all 
students. 
       
DRAWING. 
The drawing work of the school may be classified under three heads: Constructive, 
representative, and decorative work. The time is divided equally between free-hand 
and mechanical work, the two being carried along side by side throughout the entire — 
course. 
The equipment of the drawing rooms includes a good assortment of models, casts, 
and studies. * 
Constructive drawing: Includes all drawing relating to the facts of form, such as 
free-hand and mechanical working drawings, geometric problems, surface develop- 
ments, projections, intersection of solids, and drawings relating to machine and 
building construction. 
Representative drawing: Drawings dealing with the appearance of form, such as 
drawing from cast and object with charcoal, pencil, and pen and ink. Perspective 
problems. 4

work; pen sketching and shading; perspective; designing. 
Mechanical: Machine design and construction; perspective; shades and shadows; 
geometric problems. A finished drawing with full details, embodying all that the 
pupil has learned in drawing. 
CLAY MODELING. 
This work is done the-first half of the second year, and consists of modeling from 
casts, plant forms, carvings, and designs. 
It is intended to give the pupils along with this work a knowledge of the model- 
ing of the various styles of relief decoration, such as the Greek, Roman, Romanesque, 
and Renaissance, Also in modeling from ‘plant forms to teach the pupil to see 
broadly, and while getting the character of the leaf or flower, to eliminate the non- 
essentials and those features impossible of reproduction in plastic form. 
MANUAL WORK. 
In disciplinary value, the manual work rises to the dignity of laboratory work, 
and holds equal rank with the regular academic studies. It embodies a training in 
habits of careful, patient, systematic, intelligent labor. 
The pupil is made to feel from the beginning the necessity for planning his work 
with the utmost care and exactness, i order to secure accurate results. All exer- 
cises made in the shop must agree precisely in form and dimensions with the drawing, 
usually in the form of a blue print, with which each pupil is provided. 
Each exercise is carefully planned to embody some definite mechanical principle, 
and to bring into use, one after another, the various shop tools. The shop teacher 
explains the construction and use of each tool as it is needed and gives directions 
for its care. Then in the presence of the class he shows exactly how to perform the 
work, and also occasionally by way of a caution, “How not to do it.” 
Economy of time, labor, and material is taught and enforced by careful super- 
vision. Special attention is given to the formation of habits of neatness and onde) 
and to the employment of workmanlike methods. 
For boys the work is as follows: 
First year.—Joinery, turning, carving: In the joinery course only hand tools are 
employed. The obje ct of the course being to give practice in the use of the princi- 
pal woodworking tools and teach the elementary principles of construction. 
The course in wood carving affords instruction in the use of the principal wood- 
carving tools, and a further training in appreciation of beauty of form in design. 
After the work at the bench, wood turning is taught. No kind of shopwork is 
more fascinating to the student, or presents a greater opportunity for developing an 
appreciation for grace, symmetry, and beauty in form. 
Throughout the year frequent talks are given by the instructor upon such topics 
as these: Distribution of forests; processes of lumbering; the principal varieties of 
wood and their leading uses; physical properties of wood; its behavior under var- 
ious conditions; its proper distribution in construction; preservation of timber, ete. 
Second year.—Patterv making, molding, forging: Some foundry work precedes the 
pattern making, in order that the student may better understand the construction 
of patterns. 
The course in pattern making will consist in plain work; pulley, pipe, gear, and 
core work. In the foundry the students are taught to make molds and cores, each 
student pouring for himself into the molds that he has made. 
Forging: Exercises in drawing, upsetting, shaping, bending, welding, punching 
and cutting, hardening and tempering of steel. 
During the course each student forges and tempers a set of steel lathe tools, to be 
used in the shopwork of the following year.

MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1005 
    in ornamental ironwork closes the year’s work. 5 
Third year.—Vise work and machine tool work: The vise work includes chipping, 
surface filing, straight, angular, and round fitting, scraping, and finishing. 
The machine tool work is designed to teach the uses of the most common machine 
tools and the elementary principles of machine construction, 
It consists of a series of graded exercises involving the uses of the lathe, drill, 
planer, shaper, milling, and grinding machines, and will include work in cast and 
wrought iron, steel, and brass. 
The ground covered may be summarized as follows: 
Lathe work, consisting of centering, drilling, and countersinking, straight and 
taper turning, chuck work and screw cutting, also hand turning, filing, and polishing. 
Planing and shaping, including the production of both plane and curved surfaces, 
and key seating. 
Straight and spiral milling, includes key seating, gear cutting, and the fluting of 
taps, drills, and reamers. 
Grinding and fitting, including the sharpening of milling cutters and reamers, and 
the grinding of hardened steel arbors and gauges. 
During the year some project such as a small motor, dynamo, steam engine, or 
machine tool is constructed. 
MANUAL WORK FOR GIRLS. 
First year.—Sewing, joinery: Instruction and practice is given in all the important 
varieties of plain sewing by hand, including mending and darning, also drafting and 
cutting patterns of undergarments. 
Lectures are given by the teacher upon the nature and manufacture of the mate- 
rials used in the work. Local mills and factories are visited by the classes. 
From January to June, joinery alternates with the sewing. ‘This work isintended 
to familiarize the girls with the principal wood-working tools, and elementary con- 
structive principles, and thus serve as a basis for their work in wood carving in the 
following year. 
Second year.—Sewing, wood carving: Cutting and fitting garments; care and use 
of the sewing machine, instruction in selecting and purchasing materials. 
From January to June, wood carving alternates with sewing. Instruction is given 
in correct methods of handling wood-carving tools, and in the principles of applied 
design for relief ornament. A variety of woods, from soft to hard, are employed. 
Third year.—Cooking, domestic economy: The instruction in cookery is both 
theoretical and practical, and is intended to furnish many illustrations of applied 
chemistry. 
Laboratory methods are employed, and habits of neatness, order, economy, and 
systematic work encouraged and cultivated. 
The course in domestic economy is designed to give instruction upon the subjects 
of foods, their constituents, comparative values, and proper methods of cooking. 
Instruction is also given in plain and fancy cooking, invalid cookery, chemistry of 
foods, adulterants, dietetics, and the care of the house. 
The work of the kitchen is done by three housekeepers appointed from the class 
each day; instruction is given in the use of sapolio and scouring agents, the care of 
silver, and sweeping and dusting. 
Foods are treated in relation to the demands of the body, with attention to physi- 
ological subjects. Milk is taken as a type of a perfect food, and its analysis forms 
the basis of all analytical work. Special study is given to economics and the food 
questions in household economy, such as the production of the most nutritious foods 
from the cheapest materials, the best methods of cooking, and the advantageous 
use of food remnants. 
‘The equipment of the cooking room includes a coal range,a gas range, and an 
Aladdin oven, The room fittings are designed to accommodate class sections of 
twenty-four at one time. 
The arrangement of the subject-matter of the course for the year is as follows: 
Fall term.—Fruit cookery, water, starch, milk, eggs, fish, meats, soup stock, and 
simple desserts. Special attention is given to the housework, and only the simplest 
methods of cooking are employed. 
Winter term.—Marketing, baking powder, yeast, batters, doughs, bread, and the 
more elaborate desserts. Work in physiology and dietetics. 
Spring term.—Fancy cooking, invalid cookery, preparation of economical menus, 
dietetics, questions of ventilation and sanitation, practice in laying the table and 
serving.    
EQUIPMENT OF THE SHOPS, ETC. 
The joinery shop is 32 by 51 feet. It has 13 double cabinetmaker’s benches with 
set of tools for each bench; each bench has 6 locked drawers in which are kept the 
individual sets of edge tools of the pupils working at the bench.
-P-A-G-E-48
           
1006 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The pattern shop is 32 by 60 feet. It is furnished with 12 double cabinetmaker’s 
benches, with set of tools for each bench; the same provisions for individual edge 
tools are made here, as in the joinery shop, with the addition of a set of turning 
gouges and chisels. The equipment also includes 25 wood lathes, a band saw, and2 
grindstones. 
~The foundry has accommodations for class sections of 24. Tor the present lead is 
the only metal used in casting. 
‘The forge shop is 35 by 58 feet. It is located on the ground floor, and is equipped 
with 25 Buffalo F ‘orge Company’s improved down-draft forges. The blast is fur- 
nished by a fan driven from the motor in the engine room. The equipment also 
includes 25 anvils and sets of hand tools, a tool rack containing a complete assort- 
ment of special tools, a post drill, a powerful hand punching and shearing machine, 
and 5 vises mounted on the benches which surround the room. In the benches aro 
locked drawers which contain the pupils’ work aprons and unfinished work. 
The machine shop is 32 by 60 feet. It is equipped with the following machine 
tools: 6 Reed engine lathes, 14-inch swing, 5-foot bed; 8 Putnam engine lathes, 14- 
inch swing, 5-foot hed; 1 Pratt & Whitney engine lathe, 16-inch swing, 7-foot bed; 
1 Putnam engine lathe, 20-inch swing, 7-foot bed; 2 Pratt & Whitney hand lathes, 
9-inch swing, 30-inch bed; 1 Brown & Sharpe 9- inch universal hand ‘lathe; 1 Pratt 
& Whitney ‘hand lathe, 14-inch swing, 5-foot bed; 1 13-inch Slate sensitiv ° upright 
drill; 1 221-inch Barnes upright drill; 1 grindstone; 1 Diamond Machine Company 
wet emery grinder; 1 Cincinnati Milling Machine Company universal cutter and 
reamer grinder; 1 Cincinnati Milling Machine Company No. 1 universal milling 
machine; 1 Gould & Eberhardt 12-inch shaper; 1 Gray planer, 22-inch by 6-foot bed; 
1 gas blowpipe for hardening, tempering, and brazing. 
Two sides of the room are lined with benches on which are mounted 18 Prentiss 
vises, for work in chipping and filing. Underneath each vise is a drawer containing 
steel scale, try square, hand vise, dividers, chipping hammer, etc. In addition to 
these, each student has a separate drawer in which to keep his assortment of files, 
chisels, and lathe tools, as well as his unfinished work. 
The tool room, which occupies a space 9 by 16 feet in one corner of the shop, con- 
tains a complete assortment of necessary appliances, such as chucks, drills, reamers, 
taps, dies, gauges, surface plates, micrometer calipers, etc. 
The engine room is situated directly under the machine shop, and contains a 60- 
horsepower Reynolds Corliss engine, “1890” frame. It is fitted with indicator pipe 
and reducing motion, so that by means of the Crosby indicator and Amsler polar 
planimeter, students are taught how to properly adjust the valves, calculate the horse- 
power, etc. 
This engine furnishes the power for the shops, while a 15-horsepower, slide-valve 
engine is used to drive the two large ventilating fans which furnish a constant sup- 
ply of fresh air of an uniform temperature to all parts of the building. 
A 12-kilowatt 500-volt Edison motor is used to drive the blower which supplies 
ae pak to the forge shop. The current is supplied from one of the city power 
plants. 
Tools and materials required in the shops are furnished by the school. When the 
exercise made in school is something which the pupil is to carry away and retain, 
tben he is required to furnish the material. 
  [From a letter from C. A. Bradley, principal of the school.]   
Cost value of plant is about $135,000. The annual expense of maintenance is 
difficult to tell. Our school is a new one, and this is the first year that all of the 
departments are in working order. So far as materials for the shops and laborato- 
ries are concerned I think that the cost per pupil will average about $6 for the year. 
In other directions the cost of maintenance will not differ from that of any other 
first-class high school. 
So far as my experience goes it seems that the effect of manual training upon other 
studies is to stimulate them, or rather to make it possible to do more and better 
work in the same time. The effect in the laboratory work is quite marked; pupils 
who have had manual training work are much superior to those who have not had it. 
WASHINGTON, D. C. 
WHITE SCHOOLS. 
[Statement by J. A. Chamberlain, director of manual training.] 
1, The central idea in the instruction,—There are two classes of pupils who are 
~ attracted by the opportunities presented by the manual instruction. The first have 
higher technical study in view, and this preliminary instruction may be said to thus 
be “educational only.” The other class do not expect to go on to higher study but,  
-P-A-G-E-49
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1007 
while they have not in every case a definite trade or occupation in view, yet they or 
their advisers believe the manual instruction would prove valuable in almost any 
line of work. For this class the instruction may be said to be more or less a direct 
preparation for actual work. In planning a course of study, therefore, it has seemed 
necessary to consider the motives leading both these classes of pupils to take the 
manual work. 
The aim in the Washington schools has been to make the educational idea para- 
mount, but it is believed that while serving educational ends the so-called practical 
side can also be recognized without inviting the criticism that the instruction is 
tending toward industrial or. trades teaching, neither of which is considered proper 
in public-school work. 
In grammar grades seven and eight the instruction is obligatory except for a 
very small percentage who present valid excuses. In the high school the work is 
elective. It may be taken as a minor, or half, study for two periods a week, or as a 
major study for six periods a week. 
2. Organization.—Manual training is part of the regular public school course of 
study. Annual appropriation is made by Congress for the purchase of supplies and 
for pay of teachers. There is no charge for tuition.

The instruction is largely individual, although the class method is followed some- 
what. The latter is always supplemented by the former, and to the greatest extent 
with the youngest pupils. The exerciscis executed by the teacher in view of the class, 
the steps in the process being emphasized. Where possible the uses of the tools are 
likewise taught by steps. There is no general time limit set for the completion of 
any piece; each pupil works at his own best gait. When he is through with an exer- 
cise ho takes up the next in order, regardless of the progress of the rest of the class. 
The rapid worker is not given more exercises than his slower neighbor. He may be 
required to produce better results, however, and later in the year he reaps the benefit 
of his ability by being allowed to make a larger, more elaborate or more difficult 
special piece or project. Pupils of less ability are given less choice in the selection 
ot a project, but their work is treated with the same consideration. 
» 4, Material equipment.—The buildings are old, rented makesbifts, unworthy of eon- 
sideration in this connection. This statement applies more particularly to the build- 
ings occupied by the high-school shops; many of the shops for the grammar-school 
work are located in regular school buildings, and answer the purpose very well, 
except where basement rooms are used. 
The 17 bench shops for the use of the seventh and cighth grades are equipped 
with, altogether, 216 benches and sets of tools. The latter include all the most 
generally used woodworkers’ tools. In each shop there is also a set of such tools as 
are less often needed; these are for use in common by all the boys attending tho 
shop. The first year high-school shop is furnished with 18 wood-turning lathes and 
sets of tools and 5 benches and sets of tools; the latter are for such bench work as 
is required by the pattern work. The second year high-school shop equipment con- 
sists of 16 forges and anvils and sets of tools. The machine shop contains 6 10-inch, 
1 12-inch, and 1 14-inch engine lathes, 1 10-inch hand lathe, 1 6-foot planer, 1 20-inch 
drill, 1 10-inch shaper, 1 milling machine and 1 tool grinder. In addition to these 
machines there are the usual small tools found in a well-equipped shop. There are 
also vises and benches. All the tools provided for all kinds of work are the best 
made, and of sufiicient variety to insure a suitable diversity of results. As the 
work is carried on, primarily, for mind training through the hand, many of the 
“labor-saving” tools and machines are not provided. 
5. Cost.—About $17,500 have been spent for equipment to date. From this sum 
$2,500 can fairly be deducted, because spent, in part, for replacing cheap machines 
which were bought at a time when the small amount of money available and the large 
number seeking accommodation made it necessary, and in part for labor of twice 
rearranging the high-school shops in the effort to provide needed facilities in build- 
ings inadequate for the purpose in hand. 
Making the deduction indicated above makes the value of the entire plant about 
$15,000. The annual expense of maintenance is $3,900.

    1008 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
6, Results.—The following statements are taken from the reports of regular 
teachers: ‘It leads to greater accuracy.” ‘It develops habits of industry.” ‘It 
relieves the monotony of school work.” ‘It tends to make pupils more skillful in 
handling school apparatus,” ‘The change in occupation and thought has had a 
beneficial effect.” 
‘There is not much definite information as to the effect of the instruction upon the 
length of school life, but some instances are known where the pupil remained longer 
in school than he would have done otherwise, and it is believed that the tendency is 
to prolong the school life in many cases. 
No statistics of the occupations of graduates have ever been collected, though 
some are known. There is a large number who are advanced students, largely in - 
technical lines. Several have entered the shops of the Washington Navy-Yard as 
apprentice pattern makers and machinists; several are in railroad and other shops; 
others are in patent attorneys’ offices as draftsmen and assistants, while three are 
conducting the patent soliciting business on their own account. Three ara teachers 
of manual training. 
[From the course of study, 1892.] 
WORK IN SHOPS. 
Wood—Seventh and eighth years.—Bench work: The correct method of using planes,

trom their own tracings and drawings. 
Second year.—Forging: The making and management of a forge fire and the forging 
of small articles of iron involving all fundamental operations. 
Steel tool-making, hardening, and tempering. 
Third and fourth years.—Machine-tool work: The use of engine lathe, planer, 
shaper, drill press, and hand lathe in the various processes of metal turning, boring, 
thread cutting, planing, slotting, drilling, polishing, etc., upon cast iron, wrought 
iron, steel, brass, and composition. 
COURSE IN COOKING. 
Seventh and eighth years.—The object of the course is to give the pupils instruction 
in plain cooking and in housekeeping, so far as it is dependent on the kitchen. In 
addition to recipes for ordinary dishes, and making and cooking the same in the 
school, notes are given on the proper way of mixing ingredients, and on the best 
manner of arranging and preserving provisions. As much of the chemistry of food 
is taught as is necessary for intelligent cooking. Two hours a week throughout 
the two years. 
COURSE IN SEWING. 
Third year.—Basting ; running; stitching; overcasting; hemming, three widths, 
one-eighth, one-half, and 1 inch; top sewing; workbag. 
Fourth year.—Teach bias fell; French seam; tucking; gathering, plain and French; 
patching; buttonholes; drafting of seamless waist and making of same. 
Fifth year.—Gussets; Buttonholes and buttons; cloth darning, with and without 
iece, straight and three-cornered; garment mending, both patching and darning; 
emstitching; feather stitching; herring-bone stitch; draft skirt and make same. 
Sixth year.—Buttonholes, cotton and cloth; stocking darning; draft drawers and 
make same; drafting of sleeve; cutting and fitting by measurement, from ‘‘The M. 
O. Jones self-adjusting tailor system,” as taught in the sixth grades in the south- 
east and southwest sections of the city. 
[From the report of W. B. Powell, superintendent of public schools, 1893-94.] 
The manual training departments of the school were prosperous last year. The 
work of these departments has been extended from year to year, until now every 
child within the District limits is provided with tuition in manual training branches 
belonging to his grade of school, excepting only those pupils attending outlying 
schools which can not without the expenditure of too much time, and therefore at 
too great a cost to the District, be reached by the teachers of these branches. The 
number of such pupils is now, however, very small, owing to the fact that means of 
convenient transit have developed in nearly every part of the District within a few 
ears. 
» These branches of education continue to be held in high repute by the parents 
whose children are taught, while the supervisors, who have given much time and 
careful thought to the consideration of their value as educational factors, as well as
-P-A-G-E-51
        
MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1009 
rts of the school curriculum, are to the consideration of their relation to the other y 
ions to our means and processes unanimous in pronouncing all of them valuable acquis 
of education. 
This high opinion of the value of these manual exercises in our schools is held by 
the majority, if not all, of the teachers. The interruptions occasioned by the division 
of schools when classes are sent to the shops or to the kitchens offer opportunity to 
the teacher to get closer to the minds of the pupils that remain, and to understand 
their needs better, and to provide for them more intelligeatly. This interruption at 
first was a source of annoyance and the occasion, possibly, of some loss of time, and 
was, therefore, objected to by some conscientious and painstaking teacher But 
these are not now considered interruptions, but are welcomed as opportunities for 
doing a work much needed, a work which can be done best when the distracting 
influences of large numbers are few or altogether absent. The pupil now. takes 
readily to the custom of leaving his schoolroom for an hour or two once or twice a 
week to engage in other profitable and educating pursuits, and, because the change 
requires the exercise of other faculties and occasions a variation of processes, he ha 
grown to relish the work and to profit by it. 
We have so related the manual training branches of work to the others of the school 
curriculum, and this articulation or complementary adjustment of school exercises has 
become so thoroughly understood by the teachers and pupils that not only is economy 
of work a result, but in many cases certain parts of many subje<ts are now taught 
much more efficiently than ever before. The drawing and everything that pertains 
to it is now either a necessary introduction to or an accompanying part of or a 
rational outcome of much of the other manual work, and at the same time lays a 
necessary foundation upon which to build, or establishes the necessary pri 
cepts out of which only true art can be built or developed. The cooking g' oppor- 
tunity for the exercise of thoughtful work in several branches of English composition 
and is used largely for that purpose. Besides this, the children’s knowledge of 
elementary chemistry, elementary physics, and the application of hygiene is increased 
and made practical. The child finds that when he is at work in the shop he is 
demonstrating the truth of what he has learned by experiment or from the text- 
books in the regular schoolroom under another subject nominally and under the 
direction of another teacher. The arithmetic learned under the tuition of the regu- 
lar teacher is applied and enlarged, taking on new meanings and greater significance 
by the boys in the carpenter shop and by the girls in the cutting and fitting shops. 
The boy’s knowledge of nature 18 enlarged and enriched by learning of the nature 
of wood, or iron, or other metal, the place of its growth and tlie uses to which it is 
put. The girl’s knowledge of nature is correspondingly increased_by the study of 
food products, their sources and their multifarious values, in the cooking school, and 
by a consideration of the sources and values of the materials which she cuts into 
foria in the cutting and fitting school. These children might study from the one 
source in the one kind of school and from another source in another kind of school 
without economy and without making the two schools complementary or mutually 
helpful and broadening. I am calling your attention to the condition of our schools 
and the quality of our teaching, about which it is my duty to inform you, to say 
that this is not the case. The regular and the technical teacher work in harmony 
alike for the accomplishment of the broader growth of the child, each one supple- 
menting or complementing rather than repeating, under another name or for another 
purpose, the work of another teacher. It has taken years of labor to accomplish 
this integration of work or this complementary effort of all who take part in the 
development of the child. But Ineed not remind you that this is to a large degree 
the legitimate and mandatory office or duty of the superintendent and his assistants. 
That the work has been fully accomplished is not assumed, but I am glad to be able 
to state that it has reached a high degree of efficiency and that it is improving year 
by year, and, what is as gratifying, I may also state that the efforts of the supervis- 
ing corps to accomplish this are seconded in a most commendable degree by the teach- 
ers of the schools, 
The effect of the manual training connected with the art work and with the primary 
reading and language work in the lower grades is very evident since it has been in 
operation long enough for its results to be tested, when the pupils in the higher 
grades are set to do more intricate work, work requiring care and skill. The effect 
of this training is observable in the work of the boys when they first go to the car- 
penter shop, and its growth is also observable when they go from the carpenter shop 
to the manual training shops and the chemical, physical, and biological laboratories 
of the high schools, They learn to do well now in one year or in a given time what 
pupils could do but indifferently in double the time a few years since. The economy 
in the expenditure of effort, also, on the part of the child no less than on the part of 
the teacher, compared with what it was a few years ago to accomplish corresponding 
results, is noticeable.

added to as the school needed room. 
All the tools used are the property of the school. 
5. The cost of the plant outside of the buildings was about $40,000. The amount 
appropriated for the school each year is from $40,000 -to $50,000. Last year we 
expended about $38,000, nearly $30,000 being for instruction. 
The effect upon the other studies is good, but the fact that most of the students 
would not attend any school unless hand training were a part of the course makes 
it difficult to obtain absolutely reliable statistics. 
The occupations the graduates enter are varied. Many enter technical schools, 
while many others go into some occupation where they can use some of the skill 
acquired in their school course.

  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1011 
MANUAL TRAINING IN GRAMMAR SCHOOLS. 
[From the report of Mr. A, G. Lane, city superintendent, 1895.] 
The beneficial resuits of the introduction of manual training into the seventh and 
eighth grades of some of the grammar schools have been clearly demonstrated, and 
the time has come when the system can be further extended. During the past year 
assistants were employed in the Tilden School and in the Medill School (to which 
the class was removed from the Garfield School building), thus allowing the boys 
from six additional grammar schools to receive instruction and to have shop practice. 
Mr. Richard T. Crane, who first provided for manual training in the grammar 
grades at the Tilden School three years ago, still pays all the expenses connected 
with that school, except the salary of the assistant teacher, which is paid by the 
board of education. There are two rooms in the well-lighted basement which are 
used for shop practice. Classes from the Tilden, Skinner, Brown, Emerson, Hayes, 
Carpenter, Washington, Armour Street, and Wells schools receive instruction once 
a week at the Tilden School. 
~The following schools are accommodated at the Medill School: Dore, Goodrich, 
Garfield, Throop, Walsh, Froebel, Cooper, and Clarke schools. 
Classes from the Jones, Haven, Moseley, Douglas, and Calumet Avenue schools are 
taught at the Jones School, and the Agassiz, Alcott, Hawthorne, Knickerbocker, and 
Prescott schools are accommodated at the Agassiz School, 
The work continues to attract and greatly interest all boys who are permitted to 
receive instruction. In several instances requests have been received to permit boys 
in sixth-grade classes to take the shop practice also. 
Boys are surprised to find that they can handle tools, make working drawings, and 
then execute work in accordance with them. They discover their power to do 
things, to make things. The discipline of continuous, interesting, and effective 
work is yery valuable. 
        
      Moline Manual TRAINING ScHooL, MOLINne, Itn. 
[Statement by 0. Curtis Wicks, director of manual training.] 
Our school is five years old, and its central idea is educational, but this being a 
distinctively manufacturing city we find it best not to ignore the fact that our boys 
on leaving school enter the shops, and in a sense we teach a trade to meet the needs 
of the boys. A few of our boys pursue their studies further in the technical school. 
The work is obligatory on all seyenth and eighth grade pupils, but is entirely 
optional in the high school. 
Our school is connected with the public-schools system, is supported from the 
general fund, and is entirely free. 
Course of study.—Seventh grade: Sloyd; cutting tool—knife; laying out tools— 
gauge, square, compass, rule, pencil. Work taught in regular schoolroom 45 min- 
utes per week. Eighth grade: Fifty-five boys; time, one-half day each week; bench 
work in wood; elementary useful articles. 
Exercises: Gauge exercise, pen tray, half-lap joint, tile handle, key label, string 
i and ruler, paper knife, hone, soap tray, blotter pad, spoon, table mat, 
inch), towel roller, hatchet handle, mail box, try square, bevel square, open 
          
  dovetail joint, book rack. 
We always precede the work by making a drawing either from a model or a drawing. 
irst year: Advanced bench work, three periods of 45 minutes each 
per w sses of 14 each. Exercises: Bench hook, stool, spoon, knife box, 
dovetail joint, framed triangle 45°, framed triangle 30° and _ 60°, tusk tenon, scarfed 
joint, stool, dovetail brace joint, box-dovetail corners, small paneled door, beveled 
ay, fly-wheel arms, sash (4 lights). 
Second year: Lathe work (time, three periods of 45 minutes each per week, 1 class 
of 9 boys), Exercises: Cylinder, rolling curves, stepped cylinder, cylinders and con- 
eave cuts, potato masher, chair leg, 1 pair indian clubs, 1 pair dumb-bells, rolling 
pin, chisel handle, ring, mallet, stool, vase form (original). 
Our bench room is equipped with 14 single benches, each supplied with 1 rapid- 
acting vise, 3 planes, 6 chisels, 3 saws, 2 gauges, 1 square, 1 pair wing dividers, 1 
hammer, 1 mallet, 1 brush, 1 bench stop, 1 bevel square, 1 rule, 1 oil stone and can, 
2 brad awls, 1 screwdriver, 1 bench hook, 1 gauge, 2 files. 
We also have about $100 worth of special tools in cases on the wall, including braces 
and bits, pliers, saw set, saw clamp, spoke shaves, plow hand drill, ete. Our machine 
room is supplied with 7 wood-turning lathes, 1 scroll saw, 1 circular saw, 1 band saw, 
and 1 grindstone. 
The main aim of our work, as I said before, is educational, but we also plan our

work that it may work on lines that shall insure, during and by means of the exer- 
cise it affords, the development of the pupil in other definite directions. These are 
of various kinds. As the more important, it is usual to bring forward pleasure in 
bodily labor, and respect for it, habits of independence, order, accuracy, attention 
and industry, increase of physical strength, development of the power of observa- 
tion in the eye, and of execution in the hand. 
Educational manual training has also in view the development of the mental power, 
or in other words, is disciplinary in its aim. 
MANUAL TRAINING HiGH ScHooL, Lovisvit1y, Ky. 
[From the Fourth Annual Report of 1894-95.] 
The school was founded May 2, 1892, when the following proposition was laid 
before the board of trustees of the Louisville public schools: 
“To the Louisville School Board: 
‘‘GENTLEMEN: I propose to purchase a suitable lot, to erect thereon a building 
suitable and sufficient to accommodate 300 pupils, to equip said building with furni- 
ture, tools, and machinery suitable and necessary for a manual training high school 
of the first order, and convey said property, when complete, to the Louisville school 
board in trust and upon the following conditions: 
“First. That the said property shall be used as a manual training high school and 
not otherwise. 
“Second. That the board shall establish and maintain in said building a manual 
training high school of the first order as a part of the public school system, free to 
all white boys in the city qualified to enter the male high school, and not under 13 
years of age. 
“Third. The teachers and professors in the manual department shall in every case 
be graduates of some reputable manual training school. 
“Fourth. The board shall keep the property fully insured, and if destroyed by 
fire rebuild the property at once. 
“Fifth. That no special trade shall be taught in said school nor any articles 
manufactured therein for sale. 
“Sixth, That if the board at any time fail to comply with the conditions herein 
the trust shall cease at my option, provided that six months’ notice of a purpose to 
declare said trust ended shall be given by me or my heirs to said board; and if 
within that time the terms of the trust be complied with in good faith, said trust 
shall not cease, but continue upon the same conditions as before. 
“Seventh. If the trust be terminated, as provided in the foregoing section, the 
board shall reconvey the property herein, on demand, to me or my heirs. 
“T propose, upon the acceptance of this proposition, to proceed to carry out my 
part of the above proposition. 
“A.V. DUPONT. 
“LOvIsvILuE, Ky., May 2, 1892.” 
This proposition was unanimously accepted by the board. 
Mr. duPont lost no time in putting his proposition into execution, and on the 3d 
of October, 1892, the school was opened. 
PLAN AND PURPOSE OF THE SCHOOL, 
The plan of instruction followed in the manual training high school is such as 
will best fit boys of ability who are mechanically or scientifically inclined, and who 
may haye neither the time nor means to continue in school after they become 17 or 
18 years of age, for positions of usefulness in the various productive and construc- 
tive pursuits. * * * 
This school recognizes the preeminent value and necessity for intellectual develop- 
ment and discipline. Close and thoughtful study is required in both shops and class 
rooms. The academic work is taken up as thoroughly as in any school and with a 
view of giving the student a broad general education, without which any special 
course of study or work is, to a. considerable extent, of little value. The course of 
study does not include Greek or Latin, as these are properly the special branches 
taken up in classical schools. In their places this school offers, as its special 
branches, courses in drawing and in shopwork. In both of these method is taught, 
and accuracy and precision are insisted upon. 
In all constructive work in the drawing room, laboratories, and shops the primary 
object is construction, and while many articles of commercial value are made from 
drawings prepared by the student, they are made for the purpose of instruction, 
rather than that a finished article may be produced. Similarly, many of the tests
-P-A-G-E-55
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1013 
and measurements made in the laboratories would be of considerable commercial 
value if performed in the laboratories of business concerns. Their only value here, 
however, is the instruction which they furnish. 
COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. 
Provision is made for but one course of study, which occupies three years of two 
terms each. There are three classes—junior, intermediate, and senior. The junior 
class enters in September, and entrance examinations for this class are held in the 
school building in June and September. 
No student is permitted to elect any special or partial course. Everyone must 
take the full work of the class of which he is a member. 
Recitations are fifty minutes in length, and the classes are divided into sections, 
not more than 30 being placed in each division of the junior class, and not more 
than 24 in each division of the other two classes, so that no more are in recitation 
at one time than is consistent with thoroughness of instruction. * * * 
The subjects composing this course are elementary mathematics, English, German, 
physiology, physics, chemistry, drawing, and shopwork. The course embraces 
instruction by text- books, lectures, and laboratory and shop practice, with special 
reference to practical physics and chemistry, machine design and construction, the 
properties of materials, ete. 
    WOOD-SHOP PRACTICE. 
Two large shoprooms are used for instruction and practice in the use of wood- 
working tools. These are equipped with 30 double wood workers’ benches, 48 lathes, 
2 circular saws, 2 jig saws, and 2 crindstones, besides a bench and lathe in each room 
for the instructor. Necessary hand tools are provided for the accommodation of 150 
students. Power for the lathes and saws is furnished by two 10-horsepower electric 
motors. 
During the junior year students devote ten periods per week to woodwork. The 
course includes joinery, turning, pattern making, and carving. The first fifteen 
weeks are given to joinery. The exercises give practice in the use of the principal 
wood-working hand tools. Each exercise must be carefully laid out with meas- 
uring and guiding tools. The students next spend seven weeks with lathes and 
wood-turning tools, Pattern making follows turning. The making of patterns 
gives practice in the use of both bench and lathe tools and in building up and gluing 
stock for large pieces. This work is conducted in such a way as to secure accuracy, 
care, and judgment. During the intermediate year, students use their own patterns 
in their foundry practice. 
Six weeks of instruction in wood carving concludes the course. At the end of this 
time students become quick and skillful with hand tools, and difficult designs in 
grooving and low relief are executed.    
FOUNDRY PRACTICE, 
One large room in the shop building is equipped with a brass furnace capable of 
melting 50 pounds of metal; 12 molding troughs, 24 snap flasks, and a sufficient 
number of small tools to accommodate 24 boys. 
The course in foundry work is given during the first half of the intermediate year. 
The students are taught the names and uses of tools, and are shown in lectures how 
molds are made, where mistakes are likely to occur, and the effects of these mistakes 
upon castings. 
Students are then given very simple patterns to mold, and as progress is made 
more difficult pieces are used. Later the molds are cast, first in white metal and 
tlen in brass. Instruction is given in the composition of various alloys and in the 
use of gaggers, chaplets, and cores. From time to time lectures are given upon the 
manufacture of iron and copper and upon the construction and management of iron 
cupolas. 
FORGE PRACTICE. 
The forge shop is well lighted and ventilated and thoroughly equipped. There 
are 8 forge stands, each of which has under one hood three separate fires, thus 
accommodating 24 boys. 
The work in this department is taken up by the students in the second year, and 
is hegun with work in lead, the cold lead acting very much as hot iron does under 
the hammer, except that it can not be welded or upset. The purpose of this exercise 
is to give the student facility in using the hammer and tongs. Instruction is then 
given in the building and care of fires. Then the forging of iron is taken up and 
carried forward by the usual steps, such as drawing out, bending, twisting, setting 
shoulders, upsetting, and welding. 
The course in steel work embraces the making and tempering of such tools as 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
1014 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
serew Grivers, chisels of all descriptions, hammers of various kinds and sizes, and 
complete sets ‘of lathe tools for use in the machine shop. 
In addition to the above course, more or less time is given to project work. This 
is usually designed by the student himself, and consists in the making of 5 o’clock 
tea stands, umbrella racks, hatracks, flower stands, and other ornamental work. 
Much ingenuity and skill are often shown. 
MACIINE-SHOP PRACTICE. 
The machine shop is equipped with 12 engine lathes, 14-inch swing; 1 engine 
lathe, 18-inch swing, with grinding attachment; 6 speed lathes; 2 22-inch by 6-foot 
planers; 1shaper; 1 20-inch and 1 24-inch drill press; universal milling machine; 1 
Pratt & Whitney centering machine; 1 emery grinder; 3 1 power hack saw, and 1 gas- 
tempering forge. Besides the above machines, which are of the most improved 
pattern, the shop is well equipped with vises, taps, dies, drills, reamers, squares, 
ealipers, ete., sufficient to accommodate 24 boys at one time. The instruction in 
this department is designed to give to students a thorough knowledge of the con- 
struction of machines and practice in tho use of machine tools. From time to time 
lectures are given, discussing general methods of machine-shop practice. 
  TEXT-BOOKS AND TOOLS, 
The following list comprises text-books and tools prescribed by the Louisville 
school board. All students are required to provide themselves with these from time 
to time, as they are required. Books recommended for collateral reading, books of 
reference, and tabies furnished from the school library are not included in this list: 
Milne’s High School Algebra, Wentworth’s New Plane and Solid Geometry and 
Trigonometry, Waldo’s Descriptive Geometry, Shaw’s English Composition, Lamb’s 
Tales from Shakespere and Brown’s Rab and His Friends from Maynard’s English 
Classics, Guest’s History of England, Pancoast’s Introduction to English Liters vture, 
Civil Government (Peterman’ 8, OF other equally as good), Otis’s German Grammar, 
Bronson’s Colloquial German, Storm’s Immensee, Avery’s Elements of Natural 
Philosophy, Carhart and Chute's Laboratory Physics, Remsen’s Chemistry, Briefer 
Course; Martin’s Human Body, set of drawing instruments, triangular scale, two 
triangles, one T square, drawing board, drawing paper. 
Following is the cost per pupil, for material, for each of the several departments, 
for the scholastic year of 1894-95: Machine shop, $3.59; forge shop, $2.93; molding 
and sheet-metal shop, $3.71; woodworking shops, $2.38; chemical laboratory, $4.59; 
physical laboratory, $0.15; Grawing rooms, $0.09; general shop supplies, oil, ete., 
$0.84; repairs of all kinds, $0.28. 
The average cost of ial of all ee except fuel, for heating, was $5.89 per 
pupil. The “total receipts for tuition were $2,119.58. 
The average enrollment and attendance by years has been as follows: 1892-93, 
118 average “enrollment, 115.8 average daily attendance; 1893-94, 178.9 average 
enrollment, 174.6 average daily attendance ; 1894-95, 185.9 average enrollment, 184.4 
average daily attendance. 
The first class, consisting of 22 young men, was graduated June 15, 1894, Seven of 
these are now attending higher institutions of learning, as follows: One, the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology, Boston; two, the Rose Polytechnic Institute, Terre 
Hante; one, the State A. and M. College, Lexington; one, a school of veterinary 
surgery, Toronto; two, schools of medicine in this city. Number of graduates June 
18, 1895, 24. 
      
[From a letter from H. G. Brownell, principal of the school.] 
Our course as a whole might be described as a ‘‘junior technical course.” We do 
not pretend to teach trades. The course is obligatory npon all whose health will 
permit taking it. School is public and free to residents of city; tuition, $130 to 
nonresidents. Cost, $130,000. Maintenance costs annually $26,000. Our students as 
arule obtain better positions than do graduates from classical high schools. Many 
go away to technical schools and almost invariably are near the heads of their classes. 
Tho shop discipline and the work taken up there improve the academic work. 
The number of students who drop out is not greater than in other high schools,     
   
MaAnvuaL TRAINING SCHOOL, PORTLAND, ME. 
[Statement by Geo. H. Babb, principal of manual training.] 
1. The central idea is primarily educational. Two and a half hours per week are 
given to cach class and everyone is obliged to attend. 
2. Manual training is in connection with the three upper grades of the grammar 
schools and is supported by the city, no tuition being required. 
3. There aro about 600 pupils receiving manual training, and they are very nearly 
equally divided between the three grades,
-P-A-G-E-57
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. LOTS 
The beginners (third grade) work on thin stock, the knife, rule, and file being 
the principal tools. No instruction in drawing on paper is given in this grade, as it 
is sufficient to lay the lessons out on the stock used. 
During the second year (second grade) three dimension stock is used, and after two - 
or three preliminary lessons in drawing each pupil makes a concise working drawing 
from the model, being aided when necessary by the instructor. The plan is to have 
the drawing completed previous to the corresponding lesson in wood. 
‘The third year (first grade) stock of three dimensions is used as in the preceding 
grade, but the work is harder, requiring more accuracy in laying out the work, and 
much more care in working to the lines. In this grade every lesson in the course is 
planned to be of some use to the boy when completed. The drawings in this grade, 
like those in the preceding grade, are made from a study of the model, but there is 
much more individuality to each drawing, as the plan is not to give general instrue- 
tion, the instructor giving individual help when necessary. 
During the year a turning lathe and an electric motor have been added to the 
equipment. As no class instruction can be given with one lathe, only those boys 
who desire to remain after hours receive instruction, and what has been given has 
been of a very practical nature, the object of the lathe being to have the boys keep 
the chisel handles, vise handles, etc., in repair. The grindstone has also been 
attached to the shafting and is driven by power. 
The boys in the second grade are taught to stone their chisels, planes, ctc., only, 
while those in the first grade are taught to grind as well as stone all the edge tools. 
During the last two 's considerable time has been given to the study of the 
different kinds of woods in our own locality. A large wood collection has been 
added to the school by the boys. This work has proven very interesting to both 
instructor and boys. 
4, There are two rooms, each equipped with 30 benches. Each bench has upon it 
4 planes, 3 saws, 3 chisels, 2 files, 1 hammer, 1 brush, 1 mallet, 1 marking gauge, 1 
level, 1 trisquare, 1 2-foot rule, 2 bits, 1 bit brace, 1 nail set, 1 screw driver, a draw- 
ing board, T-square, triangle, and a bench hook. Besides the bench equipment each 
roomehas a good equipment of special tools. 
One of the rooms is in the fourth story of a school building, and is very inconvenient 
everyway. ‘The other is on the first floor of another school building, and has every 
necessary convenience. 
5. The cost of,equipping the two rooms was $1,500. The annual expense is: Sala- 
ries, $2,300; cost of material and incidentals per year, about $400; total expense per 
year, $2,700. Average cost per boy, about $4.50. 
6. The results of manual training in the class room have been very satisfactory, 
because it has helped to stimulate correct reasoning, has decreased truancy, and has 
served to keep boys in school longer.   
  BALTIMORE, Mp, 
BALTIMORE POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE. 
[Statement by John W. Saville, president.] 
Manual training is intended merely as a stepping-stone to higher technical study. 
It does not aim to teach a trade, but does aim to give an insight into many. The 
central idea of such instruction is to develop all the faculties a youth may possess, 
whereas in a purely collegiate school we frequently find that there is no association 
whatever of theory and practice; in a manual training school the two go hand in 
hand. e 
Owing to opposition, the promoters of manual training have not yet met with the 
success that they feel will one day crown their efforts. I boldly predict, however, 
that when that day does arrive, the superiority of the manual training school boy 
to the collegiate student can be easily demonstrated. My belief in this prophecy 
arises from the fact that in this system of instruction may be found the secret of true 
education; the mind should be stored with ideas, instead of words, using the latter 
only so far as they are needed to convey the necessary ideas to the mind. 
The Baltimore Polytechnic Institute bears the same relation to the public-school 
system of Baltimore as do the other public schools. It is supported by the tax- 
payers, thereby making tuition free, excepting to nonresident students, who are’. 
obliged to pay a fee of $50 per year. 
The completion of the entire course requires five years, two of which are devoted 
to preparatory work. During each year, except the last, the students work alter- 
nately in the metal and wood shops, spending half of the year in each shop. This 
is obligatory; the students have no choice in the matter. The final year they 
devote entirely to the construction of some one piece of machinery, such as a triple- 
expansion engine, a steam pump, lathe, ete. This and the preparatory department 
constitute the principal unique features of our work.

direct-acting steam engine (of 9-inch diameter of cylinder and 14-inch stroke of 
piston) built by the members of the graduating class of 1893. 
The value of our plant is $60,000. The annual expense of maintenance is $30,000, 
‘The study of manual training seems to increase the desire of the learner to pursue 
other studies. Seeing, each day, in the mechanical department, the practical appli- 
cation of the rules which they are taught in the academical department, it is but 
natural that they should take an equal interest in both theory and practice. 
NIGHT CLASSES. 
In October, 1894, the board of school commissioners authorized the opening of night 
classes to meet the desires of students who were unable to attend the day school. 
Classes were organized in arithmetic, algebra, bookkeeping and penmanship, 
mechanical and free-hand drawing, carpentry, spelling, typewriting, stenography, 
and clectricity. 
The classes in drawing and bookkeeping have been very large. ‘The efforts of the 
students have been enthusiastic throughout, and they have shown great apprecia- 
tion of their privilege. 
The experiment has been very successful and the continuance of these classes is 
assured. The classes meet on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights of each week. 
The total number in attendance during the year has been 759. 
SEWING. 
[From the report of Mr. Henry A. Wise, city superintendent, for 1893.] 
Instruction in sewing is given to the girls in the third grade of the primary schools, 
and to those of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades of the grammar 
schools. 
The instruction is given by 14 special teachers under the supervision of a direct- 
ress of sewing. Thirteen thousand six hundred and fifty-seven pupils are taught 
this branch, each of whom receives an hour’s lesson once a week. The reports 
received from principals and teachers generally speak very decidedly in favor of the 
great advantages this instruction is to the girls and of its good effect upon the other 
work of the school. It is claimed by some of the principals and teachers that since 
the introduction of sewing into the schools the interest of parents in the work of the 
schools has increased, better attendance has been secured, the girls have become 
neater, more orderly, and that more interest has been awakened in the other studies 
pursued in the schools, 5

MECHANIC ARTS HIGH SCHOOL, 
[From the report of George H. Conley, supervisor, 1896.] 
The Mechanic Arts High School will complete the third year of its existence in 
June and the class which entered when its doors were first opened will graduate. * * * 
‘The course of study following serves at present as a guide for the work of the 
school, and in all probability, with such changes as in time may prove desirable, it 
will continue to be observed as the permanent arrangement or the general plan of 
work; but to arrange a course of study that shall carry out to the best advantage 
the purposes intended in the organization of this school will require such length “of 
time as shall be amply sufficient ‘to demonstrate its needs. It is only through experi- 
ence that these needs can be ascertained and that a satisfactory course, one adapted 
and adequate to meet future demands, can be developed. * * * The intention is, 
as may be seen from the course of study, to provide in about equal measure for the 
study of the elements of the mechanic arts and the practical academic branches 
intimately connected with them:

The study of algebra extends through two years of the course. The first year’s 
work has special reference to the attainment of proficiency in the more important 
processes and extends through simultaneous quadratics. The second year’s work is 
a review of the work of the preceding year and extends through progression. Alge- 
braic methods are employed in the solution of such problems as are met with in the 
study of physical scienco and in the mechanical departments of the school. Also 
during the second year the subject of plane geometry is completed. ? 
The first half of the third year is devoted ‘to the principles of solid geometry and | 
to numerous exercises illustrating and enforcing them, while the remainder of the 
year is given to plane trigonometry and reviews. The work in trigonometry is | 
' 
  designed to familiarize the student with the fundamental principles and formule 
that are constantly used in surveying, mechanics, physical science, and the higher 
mathematic 
The central purpose of the mathematical course is to give pupils clear notions of. 
the value and convenience of mathematical processes in the investigation of practical 
problems. The readiness with which pupils master the difficult problems of the 
machine shop that involve the application of mathematical principles testifies to 
the value of this training. 
In history and in civil ‘government the course consists of a rapid survey of general 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
1020 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
history, followed by a study of the history of England, with special reference to its 
influence upon the colonial period in America. A topical review of the history of 
the United States during the second year is designed to fix in the mind the causes 
and results of important historical movements. The instruction aims to trace clearly 
the growth of the principles of free self-government in England and their develop- 
menf when transplanted into America, to give clear notions of the character and 
functions of the colonial government, and of the municipal, State, and Federal 
governments of the present day. 
The instruction in English aims to cultivate a taste for good literature, and the 
course is largely determined by the requirements for admission to New England 
colleges. A carefulstudy of the authors read is made, with a view to awaken a genu- 
ine interest in literature in the pupils, to raise their standard of reading and thinking, 
and to improye their literary tastes. This work in literature is supplemented by 
exercises whose merits rather than defects are emphasized for improving the style of 
expression. Applications of the principles of grammar and rhetoric are drawn from 
Carpenter’s Exercises in Composition and from portions of Hill’s Foundation of 
Rhetoric, and other sources; but these books are used more as aids and for reference 
than as text-books. The distinguishing feature of this work is the emphasiz placed 
upon practice in writing and speaking correctly: 
‘The two-years course in French is adapted to enable pupils to read easy French at 
sight and to give them considerable practice in elementary French composition. It 
is designed to meet fully the admission requisitions of the leading scientific schools. 
The work in physics consists of a limited number of carefully selected laboratory 
exercises that are performed by all pupils, supplemented by lecture-table experi- 
ments, explanations, and recitations, designed to give clear ideas of the fundamental 
principles and laws in every department of elementary physics. On account of the 
training given in the shops, a smaller amount of quantitative laboratory work appears 
to be required than in the other high schools, and it is deemed undesirable to limit 
the work to the narrow range of a brief laboratory course. Special attention will be 
given to the principles of electricity and their recent practical applications. Ample 
provision has been mado to equip the school adequately with illustrative apparatus, so 
that the course in physics can be made highly interesting and instructive. 
The aim of the course in drawing is to teach the proper use of the pencil and 
drawing instruments, and to give facility in the expression of ideas of form by the 
various methods of free-hand and mechanical representation. About two-fifths of 
the time assigned to drawing each year is devoted to free-hand work and the remainder 
to mechanical drawing. The free-hand work consists of the drawing of type solids, 
simply and in groups, machinery, historic ornament and original designs for wrought- 
iron work, light and shade in charcoal, and the theory and practice of lettering. 
Much attention is given to the rapid production of drawings of models sufficiently 
accurate for many useful purposes, but by no means finished work. Such sketches 
frequently furnish the data for complete working drawings. The mechanical draw- 
ing embraces geometrical problems, elementary principles of working drawings as 
applied to shop exercises, intersections and developments, isometric projection, appli- 
cations of principles of projection to working drawings, geometrical problems ap- 
plicable to machine design, working drawings of machines, and house plans, 
It is the aim of the mechanical departments to teach in a thorough and systematic 
way the elements of carpentry, joinery, wood carving, wood turning, pattern making, 
forging of iron and steel, chipping, fitting, iron filing, and machine-tool work. For 
each department a carefully graded series of models has been chosen, the construc- 
tion of which illustrates every fundamental principle or process. The models in the 
primary series are made by all the members of a class. Running parallel with the 
primary series is a set of supplementary models that involve the application of princi- 
ples already learned to more difficult work. The supplementary exercises are under- 
taken only by those who are capable of doing more than the regular work of the 
class, This arrangement makes it practicable to adapt the rate of movement of the 
class to the needs of pupils of fair ability, while the more rapid and skillful workers 
employ their spare time upon interesting exercises that demand their best efforts. 
The work is planned so as to require the exercise of judgment, thought, and care. 
No tasks are repeated merely for the sake of gaining facility, for the educational 
value of shop exercises depends largely upon the amount of careful thought they are 
adapted to develop; and as soon as the difficulties of a given process have been fairly 
mastered a new problem is substituted. 
It is unnecessary to give a full description of all the branches of work performed 
in the different departments of shop work, since some of them have been described 
in former reports. It will suffice to describe briefly the exercises in the machine 
shop, which was completed and made ready for occupancy in September last. 
The hand tool work at the bench and hand lathe consists of exercises in chipping, 
filing, fitting of sliding parts, drilling, etc. Some of the articles made are surface 
gauges, surface plates, calipers, electric binding posts, and turned brass ornaments. 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1021 
The machine tool work consists of exercises in grinding and setting tools, and prac- 
tice upon models that exemplify the various uses of the different machines, such as 
straight, taper, and irregular turning; screw-cutting, chucking, boring, and ream- 
ing; use of boring bars as in the cylinder of the steam engine; plain and irregular 
work on the planer, shaper, and milling machine. 
The inodels, except at the very outset, consist of articles of practical use, intro- 
ducing as materials cast iron, wrought-iron, steel, malleable iron, brass, and compo- 
sition. Some of these articles are bolts, shafts, handwheels, pulleys, tools for 
various purposes, and parts of machines designed as class projects. When the parts 
of a machine are assembled, all parts are rejected which would not pass the inspec- 
tion of a reputable manufactory. All the exercises are adapted to furnish the pupil 
with material for earnest thought; to compel him to make careful and accurate 
observations concerning the nature of different materials, the action of various tools, 
and the operation of various machines. He soon learns that no work is successful 
that is not carefully planned and thoughtfully executed. 
One purpose of the course of study is to attract to the school those boys who would 
not ordinarily attend a high school, by offering them an opportunity to pursue prac- 
tical studies in connection with shop exercises which aré calculated to call forth 
their best efforts, to develop their judgment, and to give them a thorough knowledge 
of the elements of the mechanical arts as well as some degree of mechanical skill. 
A further purpose is to furnish preparation for admission to such institutions as the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Lawrence Scientific School. The 
course as arranged affords excellent preparation to this end, and is sure to arouse in 
many boys an ambition to continue their studies in these higher institutions or other 
scientific and technical schools. However, this is an ulterior purpose; but, fortu- 
nately, no better course, it is thought, can be devised for those whose school life is to 
end with the high school than one that insures satisfactory preparation for the 
higher scientific schools. In any calling the worth of such preparation will be felt, 
and in any scientific pursuit its value is priceless. In the higher scientific and tech- 
nical schools boys who have passed through good manual training courses have a 
decided advantage over those of equal ability who have not had such training, as 
evidence at hand plainly shows. Manual dexterity, with a knowledge of tools, 
materials, machinery, and mechanical processes, tends to insure in the scientific 
laboratories a more rapid progress and more ready mastery of difficult subjects. 
For all the pupils of the schoo] the subjects of study are the same, but the amount 
of work required in each subject is proportioned to the varying degrees of ability 
displayed by the pupils. The classes are so divided and the work so arranged that 
no pupil may be taxed beyond his power, while those who work rapidly receive the 
stimulus of demands caleulated to call forth their best efforts. The amount of work 
accomplished is deemed relatively unimportant in comparison with the mastery of 
correct methods and the formation of good habits. 
The school has suffered on account of the trying delay in providing for its pressing 
needs, and the satisfaction is great, indeed, to be able to state that its equipment is 
now complete. I may add that in regard to the school building, while some changes 
in construction and finish are desirable and even necessary, the class rooms and 
shops are all well lighted, perfectly ventilated, and attractive in every way. 
           
GRAMMAR SCHOOLS, 
[From the report of Mr. Frank M. Leavitt, principal of manual training schools, 1895.] 
There are at present for the use of the grammar schools 15 rooms equipped for 
wood working. Considering an average class to be 25, and that the supply of pupils 
is limited to the three upper grades, these rooms are capable of accommodating 3,635 
boys per week. There are this year 2,522 boys thus accommodated, as follows: 
Class I, 397; Class II, 1,923; Class IIT, 202. These boys are receiving instruction in 
wood working under 12 teachers, 11 special and 1 regular, Each special teacher has 
weekly an average of 225 pupils in his charge. * * * In addition to the boys’ 
classes there is a class of 30 girls from the Bowditch school. * * * 
The general need of this department to secure its future welfare is the equipment 
of more manual training centers, which will decrease the extent of the districts, and 
the greatest improvement within our reach is the further introduction of the work 
into the first or third classes, or both. * * * 
The present policy of the school committee permits this extension of manual train- 
ing in the same spirit as that which dominates the movement to enrich the grammar- 
school course. Any principal of a grammar school, finding the conditions under 
which his school is working favorable to the introduction of manual training into, 
his first or third classes, or both, is invited to make that extension without waiting 
until every other grammar school enjoys equally favorable conditions.

COURSE IN MANUAL TRAINING IN GRAMMAR SCHOOLS.! 
The relation of manual training to the study of elementary science is intimate and 
essential. Moreover, the relation of both to other departments of school work— 
especially to language, geography, and drawing—is so close as to result in mutual 
helpfulness and in economy of time and effort. 
z Me exercises in manual training are a means not only of physical and intellectual, 
but also of moral, culture. They train to habits of accuracy, neatness, order, and 
thoroughness; they make a helpful occupation for otherwise unemployed time, or a 
relaxation from less pleasurable work; they present an incentive to good work in 
all directions, and offer at all times and in all connections a moral stimulus and 
preparation for usefulness at home and in the community. 
Classes VI, V, IV (two hours a week).—Sewing, light tool work, or clay modeling. 
Nor 1.—All the girls in Classes VI, V, and IV are to spend two hours a week in 
sewing. If, however, any girl shall have passed a satisfactory examination in sew- 
ing, she will be allowed to substitute for it some other branch of manual training. 
Classes III, II (two hours a week).—Cookery, wood working, or clay modeling. 
Notre 2.—Every girl is to pursue a course of twenty lessons of two hours each in 
cookery as a regular part of the work either of Class III or of Class II. ‘ But a girl 
who shall have passed a satisfactory examination in cookery will be allowed to sub- 
stitute for it some other branch of manual training. 
Nore 3.—If the whole or a part of the time assigned to specified branches of 
manual training be not used therefor, such time may be given to any other of its 
authorized branches. 
Class I (two hours a week).—Drafting and cutting, wood working, or clay 
modeling. 
PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
Course of observation lessons and manual training. 
Class III (three hours a week).—Observation lessons on color, form, size, place, 
and prominent qualities of objects, to be related to and illustrated by each of the 
following branches of manual training :

these types (e. g., apple, nest, basket; box, house, stove; bottle, rolling-pin, muff) ; 
also of hemisphere, square prism, and triangular prism, and of familiar objects 
approaching these types (e. g., bowl, spoon, saucer; cake, brick, steps; cradle, boat, 
stool).

grade. 
© Class IT (three hours a week).—Observation lessons on plants, on animals, and 
on the human body, to be related to and illustrated by each branch of the manual 
training and by the drawing: (a) Flower, leaf, stem, root; bud, fruit, seed. (b) Do- 
mestic and other common animals. (¢) The parts of the human body and their uses 
and movements; the care and protection of the body.

animal forms approaching these types (e. g., leaf, petal, corolla, seed vessels, heads 
and trunks of various animals, bills of birds, eggs). 
- Paper folding and cutting, in colored papers (red, blue, yellow, orange, green), of 
plane figures made by sections of the above-named solids, and vf plant and animal 
outlines approaching these types (e. g., leaf, sections of fruit, flower, seeds, starfish, 
shells); also of bilateral and radiate designs based upon these, for decorative work. 
Sewing on canvas, with colored threads, on the same lines of development as in 
the paper cutting. 
Stick laying, preceding and conformed to the drawing lessons for this grade. 
Class I (three hours a week).—Observation lessons on nature, on plants, on ani- 
mals, and on the human body.

in relief on plaques, or as models for art. 
  1A letter from Mr. E. P. Seaver, the city superintendent, dated May 25, 1896, states that ‘‘the 
course of wood working in the grammar schools is still under consideration and has not been reduced 
to definite form.”

COOKING. 
[Based on the report of Amabel G. E. Hope, principal of cooking schools, 1895.] 
It is now ten years since the study of cooking was introduced into the public 
schools of Boston. There are 14 school kitchens in the city under 10 teachers, 3 
assistants, and a principal or director. The course of study in all the kitchens is 
uniform, and consists of 36 lessons. The girls work in sets of 6 to 8, a plan that has 
reduced the cost of food materials to $80 per year, as against $600 under the former 
method of allowing each girl to cook a separate dish. 
All the pupils are from the second class of the grammar schools, the girls going for 
instruction to the kitchen nearest their regular class rooms.

EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
BROOKLINE, Mass. 
[Statement of S. L. Dutton, superintendent of schools.] 
The central thought in all our manual training is education, and not with reference 
to technical study or to trade. We make all branches of hand work in our grammar 
schools, including bench work, sewing, cooking, ete., obligatory—that is, it is a part 
of our regular course. 
In regard to the course of study, we are trying to have some manual work in every 
grade, beginning with the kindergarten. The first three years consists of modeling > 
in clay, cutting in paper, water color, painting, and drawing. The fourth year we 
have cutting upon wood of two dimensions, done at the pupil's desk. Commencing 
the fifth year, we have sloyd, which gradually develops in the upper grades into 
simple construction and wood turning. In one grammar school we are teaching 
sloyd, pure and simple, after the models prepared by Gustaf Larson, of Boston. The 
instructor has taken a course at Naas, Sweden. 
Iam unable to give you the value of our plant. My usual estimate for the fitting 
up of a shop for bench work is $500; for a school kitchen, $250; our wood-turning 
department costs $2,500; our foundry, $200, and our forge shop, $1,200. 
We are well satisfied that manual training has a good effect upon pupils with 
respect to other studies. Many who are slow in the more abstract subjects a 
successful in the shop, and get courage and confidence which helps them in their 
other work. Manual training helps to develop the manly tone and pride, which is 
one of the best products, as I think, of school life. We have one very large grammar 
school where the children come from the homes of working people. Many of these 
pupils after leaving school are going into mechanical pursuits, and some of them 
are making a good record. We are offering elective studies in the way of advanced 
manual training, domestic economy, and needle work to all the classes in our high 
school. As this is the first year in “whieh this plan has been pursued, I am unable 
to make any definite statements as to the results, but quite a number of our pupils 
who are preparing for college are taking this work. 
COURSE OF STUDY IN MANUAL TRAINING. 
  The following schedule provides one year of preparatory practice in wood of two 
dimensions, one year of work upon sloyd models, a year of joinery, a year of wood 
carving and construction, a year of wood turning, and a final year in pattern making 
and foundry work. 
In all elementary manual training there should be a maximum of interest. Only 
neat and accurate work is accepted. All wastefulness of material is carefully 
avoided. While class instruction is given upon the various exercises, each pupil 
works independently. Those who complete their work in advance of others are given 
supplementary exercises. 
Fourth grade.—The work of this year is done upon slips of basswood one-eighth of 
an inch thick and 4 inches square, These are shaped by the knife into simple flat 
forms, some being put together with glue or small nails. The work is done in the 
schoolroom upon the desk, a cutting board protecting the desk and holding the wood 
for the knife. In addition to the knife, each pupil has a pencil and rule. The occa- 
sional tools are the hammer, nails, a brad awl, and sandpaper and glue. 
There are sixteen models in the regular course, with extra ones for the more 
advanced pupils. The teacher makes a working drawing of the model upon the 
blackboard, then demonstrates the construction of the model and the uses of the 
tools required. The pupils draw the outlines upon the wood and cut to the lines. 
The objects to be derived from the training of this course are to read and. to make 
simple working drawings, to take accurate measurements, and to work to those 
dimensions, thereby fitting the pupil for the next year in bench work. 
Fifth grade.—The work of this year is upon sloyd models. There are 20 models in 
this course, with extra models for the advanced pupils. 
The tools used are the essential wood-working tools. The pupil works from his 
own drawing, made from the model, and estimates the worth of the work done by 
judging each part of the model. 
Sixth grade.—The work of this year is joinery. There are 14 models in this course. 
These models include the essentials of joinery, with some applications. The pupil 
works from his own drawings and blue prints. 
The theory of the use and construction of the tools is taught during this year. 
The stock used is clear pine. 
Seventh grade.—The work of this year is carving and constructive work. The 
carving course consists of 11 models which require the common carving tools. 
The latter part of the year is spent upon case work, as a further application of the 
work of the preceding years. 
     
    
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  
MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1025. 
The pupil makes one or more of the models in construction, as his time permits, 
Eighth grade.—The work of this year is wood turning. There are 21 models. 
Ninth grade.—The work of this year is pattern and foundry work. There are 21 
models in the course, 15 of which are required. 
COURSE OF STUDY IN DOMESTIC ECONOMY. 
The course extends over the last four years of the grammar school, each class 
receiving two hours’ instruction per week. In the first year it is intended to give. 
the pupils an idea of the scope of cooking, to be elaborated during the succeeding 
years; the course of each year is, however, complete in itself. It is the aim to com- 
bine both the art and the science of cooking. At the beginning of each year the 
actual cooking is to be made as simple as possible, in order to avoid confusing the 
child and also to give time for the necessary details of housework. The sequence of 
the lessons is followed as closely as possible, but in many instances seasons and prices. 
must be the guide. 
First YEar. 
Housekeeping.—The pupils wash their own dishes at the desks as soon as they have 
finished using them. ‘There are three housekeepers appointed at each lesson, who 
have general oversight of the room, their duty being to see that the room is kept and 
left in a good condition. Thus, No. 1 attends to the fire and care of the stove; No. 2 
has general charge of the room and cupboards, while No. 3 sees that the sink is left. 
clean. 
Since the important part that dust plays as a carrier of micro-organisms is becom- 
ing more and more recognized, attention is given to household bacteriology. Lessons. 
are given on how to sweep the floor; how to get rid of the dust; to wash dishes; 
the care of dish towels; the care of the sink, and the use of the various cleaning 
agents, such as sapolio, pearline, borax, putz-pomade, electro-silicon, pumice 
stone, etc. 
Lessons on the chemistry of foods. 
The food in order to enter the blood from the alimentary canal must be made 
soluble. The solution of food may be greatly aided by the preparation it receives 
before entering the alimentary canal. Water, playing the part of nature’s great 
solvent, is considered first. 
Water.—(1) Effect of cold water upon gelatin; (2) effect of boiling water upon 
gelatin; (3) difference in taste between freshly boiled water and that which has 
Deen boiled for some time; cause of difference in taste; (4) temperature of boiling 
water; cooking in high altitudes; (5) way in which the boiling point of water may 
be raised; (6) amount of water in some of the common vegetables and fruits; 
illustrate both by experiment aid charts. 
* Milk.—After water, milk is studied. Milk is a natural food and contains the food 
materials in the perfect proportions: (7) Allow milk to stand in a glass tube; notice 
what happens at first; later on; (8) temperature of boiling milk; (9) study chart 
giving composition of milk; (10) study chart giving composition of the commercial 
products of milk. The food materials in milk are taken up in turn—albumen, fats, 
sugar, and mineral matter. 
Albumen,—TLhe white of egg is typical albumen. Eggs illustrate the form of a. 
concentrated food. (11) Effect of heaton albumen; illustrate by droppedegg; (12) 
carefully separate and examine the yolk and white of an egg; set each aside for fu- 
ture study; (13) examine same in the dried state; (14) make beef tea; study the 
albumen in meat; note the effects of different degrees of heat of the water solution; 
(15) drop a piece of beef into boiling water; result. 
Fats.—(16) Extract fat from the dried yolk of egg by means of naphtha; (17) 
extract fat from corn meal with naphtha; (18) temperature of smoking fat; correct 
the expression “boiling fat;” cause of bubbles when the fat is heated. 
Sugar.—(19) Burn some sugar. Show that it contains carbon. The reason that 
carbohydrates and fats are heating is because they burn as a fuel in the body. 
Starch and cellulose are the forms of carbohydrates found in the vegetable world. 
These are considered next. 
Starch.—(20) Pop some corn; this illustrates the effect of heat on the starch grains ; 
(21) steam rice; this illustrates the necessity of water with starchy foods; measure 
before and after cooking; (22) pour boiling water upon dry starch powder; result; 
(23) break open lump and examine interior; (24) mix starch with sugar, pour on 
boiling water; (25) mix starch and cold water, pour on boiling water; induction im 
regard to pudding sauces, etc.; rule for making laundry starch; (26) put starch 
and sugar into separate tumblers, add cold water to each; give terms “solubility,” 
“insoluble,” ‘dissolve;” (27) masticate a piece of cracker thoroughly; effect of 
ED 96; 33

1026 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
saliva on starch; (28) masticate a piece of corn meal; compare with former; (29) get 
starch from a potato; (30) get starch from flour; give term “gluten” to substance 
left after the starch is washed out of the flour. 
Cellulose or woody fiber.—(31) Get cellulose from the potato; (32) get cellulose from 
the turnip. 
Cooking. 
Tho experiments just given indicate the plan of the first year’s work. Following 
are given a few of the dishes that may appropriately be given to illustrate these 
principles. The other side, namely the manipulation, is also to be considered, and 
attention is given to the various processes of cooking, viz, steeping, boiling, steam- 
ing, broiling, pan broiling, sautéing, frying, and stewing. 
Water.—Lemon gelatin; the beverages, e. g., tea, coffee, etc. 
Fruiis.—Stewed fruits, scalloped apples. z 
Water and cellulose.—V egetables—potatoes, turnips, carrots, beets, onions, spinach. 
Milk.—Rennet custard, milk toast, blanc mange. 
Albumen.—Beef tea, beefsteak, stews, hamburg steak, boiled mutton, soups, fish, 
eggs. 
“Starch.—Rice, macaroni, the cereals, lemon sauce. Additional dishes—biscuit, 
corn-meal muffins, bread pudding, bread. 
    Ssconp YEAR. 
  Housekeeping.—The housekeeping is the same as in the previous year. A review 
is made of the various cleaning agents. Each pupil is responsible for her own desk, 
and the housekeepers for the whole room. 
Chemistry of foods.—A review of the previous year’s work is made. Since meats 
are to be studied this year, more attention is given to albumen, and how to cook it. 
As the foods are studied, attention is called to their value as foods and to their com- 
position. 
The children are to learn to recognize the different food materials and food 
adjuncts, both by sight and by taste. 
Prices and how the different foods are purchased should be considered. 
The pupils should be led to see that the laws of harmony apply to the mixing and 
combinations of food; as they do in musie and color. 
Cooking. 
The practice work of this year consists in cooking meats and fish, white sauce, 
and simple desserts. 
Meats.—By means of diagram draw from class which cuts will be best for soups, 
steaks, ete. With fresh meat show difference between tough and tenderfiber. Cook 
different parts of the animal and thus get the class familiar with the different cuts 
as well as with the various methods of cooking: Beefsteak, tripe, chops, drippings, 
meat balls, liver, stew, small roast, beef roll, bacon, fricassee, minced meat on toast. 
Fish.—Fish illustrates well the cooking of albumen, Baked stuffed fish, boiled 
fish, fish chowder, fried codfish. 
White sauce.—Demonstrate. Thick white sauce may be served in various ways. 
Salmon in white sauce, creamed salt fish, scalloped fish, creamed vegetables. A 
thinner white sauce may be used for milk toast, and egg sauce for fish; very thin white 
sauce for egg vermicelli. The principle of white sauce is used*in one method of 
thickening soups. Illustrate by making tomato soup or potato soup. Some meat 
gravies aro made in same way. When possible, make gravy when cooking meat, and 
thus give additional practice in making a smooth sauce. 
Desserts.—A few simple formulas are given and the method of work carefully 
demonstrated. From theso few principles many varieties may be made either by a 
change of flavoring or by combinations, Tho following will suggest the work done 
in this line: (I) Cornstarch mold, (II) soft custard, (III) meringue, (IV) lemon gela- 
tin, (V) omelet. 
When once it is understood how certain effects are produced, an endless variety 
may be made, thus: Italian jelly, variation of IV; orange pudding, combination of 
I, II, and III; snow pudding, combination of III and IV; fruit tapioca, based on I; 
Spanish cream, combination of II, IV, and V, and so on. 
Some language work may be brought into the work, thus: The legends in regard 
to the introduction of tea and coffee as beverages are read to the class, from which 
abstracts are written. 
Dictionary exercises are given, and the pupils are taught the use of the following 
terms, with their deriv: : Digestion, maceration, to steep, infusion, decoction, 
percolation, simmer, garnish epicure, etc.

  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1027 
Tarp YEaR. 
The science of the past two years is reviewed and made broader. In connection 
with doughs the chemistry of baking powder, and the various ways to obtain carbon 
dioxide to make the dough porous, are considered. 
Foods are studied in a way ieading to the subject of dietaries. 
The cooking consists of a series of lessons on invalid cooke Just before Christ- 
as a lesson is given on home-made candies. Then the subject of doughs and batters 
ndied carefully. The latter part of the year the food materials are studied top- 
, leading to the combinations of food for simple meals, with the cost and 
qu ity necessary. The whole meal is not always prepared, but parts are, and the 
cost of the whole estimated. 
Invalid cookery.—Dishes suitable for sick-room diet are cooked, with a few sugges- 
tions relative to the comfort of the patient. At the end of the series of lessons each 
pupil is to prepare a paper on the care of an invalid, and also be able to arrange an 
invalid’s tray. 
Dishes to be prepared. Cooling drinks: Lemonade, apple water. Mucilaginous 
drinks: Irish-moss lemonade, flaxseed lemonade. Gruels: Corn-meal and oatmeal 
gruels, milk porridge. Oysters: Oyster stew, parboiled oysters. Simple desserts: 
Apple snow, lemon gelatin with prunes, blanc mange, Additional dishes: Eggnog, 
steamed custard, albumenized milk, chops. 
Demonstrate to class: Flaxseed poultice. How to wring a cloth from boiling 
water. What to do in case of a burn or a cut. 
Doughs.—The subject of doughs and batters may be made very simple. By class- 
ing those of a kind together much may be done in the time allotted. A few things 
are considered carefully: The ways in which gas is introduced to make the mixture 
light. The consistency of doughs required for certain results. Manipulation in 
regard to rolling the doughs. From the simple biscuit formula is shown how the 
other doughs may be evolved. 
Bisewit.—Dutch apple cake, strawberry shortcake, flour muffins, graham, rye, and 
corn-meal muffins, griddle cakes, cake, cookies, etc. 
      
       
    FourtH YEAR. 
The work of the last year is a résumé of what has been given the past three years. 
Many of the children may never have a high-school training, therefore it is intended 
to apply as much chemistry and physiology as is practicable. The foods are studied 
topically, and attention is given to dietaries suitable for different seasons. A review 
is made of the dishes already studied. Attention is given to garnishing, and pupils 
are instructed how from simple dishes more elaborate ones may be made. 
Manvat TRAINING SCHOOL, SPRINGFIELD, Mass. 
[Statement by George B. Kilbon, principal.] 
The central idea in our school is education, either fitting a boy for higher technical 
schools or for business, or to learn a trade more easily. The work is not obligatory. 
It is a part of the public-school system and is supported by yearly appropriation. 
Any boy in the eighth or ninth grades of the grammar school can attend once a week, 
one and one-half hours. Any boy in the high school has hitherto been allowed 
to attend every day, two hours, for three years. A courso of four years in the 
high school goes into effect next year, which is composed of two academic studies 
daily with drawing and manual training. This fits for technical schools or business. 
Our methods are by dictation where possible, and by performing in the presence 
of the class such operations as are difficult or impossible to describe. Drawings are 
made and worked from sometimes and blue prints worked from sometimes. 
We commenced in 1886 with an appropriation of $1,000, which has been yearly 
increased. From $500 to $1,000 has been spent yearly in additional equipment. We 
haye alsoin grades 4 to 7 a system of knife work which all of the 1,200 boys in those 
grades take, while girls in same grades take sewing. These two branches of inter- 
mediate grammar instruction are both very successful and highly appreciated by our 
citizens. The knife work has been gradually built up since 1887, when $10 was 
expended for equipment and a class of 12 boys taught in one school. For several 
years our regular teachers took lessons in knife work at the Manual-Training School 
and taught them to their own pupils. For three years past, however, a special teacher 
has been employed. 
The building occupied for high school and eighth and ninth grammar grades is 70 
by 50 feet, two stories and a basement. Forging and molding are in the basement,

floor. Individual tools are provided for pupils in grades 4 to 7 and general tools in 
grades 8 and 9 and high school, except individual planes for high-school pupils. 
The building is one formerly owned by the county of Hampden and used as a work- 
shop in connection with the jail. It was bought by the city for about $8,000. It 
with the entire jail buildings is to be torn down next fall and the site used for a new 
high-school building. Then the present high-school building will be devoted to 
manual training. 
Cost of equipment in this building at present is about $7,500; annual expense of 
maintaining the work in this building, about $4,000; annual expense of maintaining 
knife work in grades 4 to 7, $800. 
Results: A widespread interest in our community in manual training; an acquaint- 
ance on the part of all of our boys with tool work and on the part of some of them 
to the extent of acquiring skill and ability; the interest they take in it reacts on all 
other school work, promoting interest and aiding discipline; the grammar manual 
training is known in some cases to prolong school life. The high school is so much 
hampered by contracted quarters and new building plans that its manual training 
suffers with other branches in proper development. 
Of 19 graduates since 1891, 1 is now teaching in our own manual training school, 
6 are engaged in drafting, 4 have finished or are pursuing a technical course, 1 is a 
clerk in a hardware store, 4 are employed as mechanics, 1 enters college, and 2 take 
additional study next year in our high school. 
Woodworking equipment.—This consists of 34 benches and sets of tools, costing $850; 
256 drawers for holding work in process, 200 drawers for holding prepared material, 
and supplies costing $484. 
The benches are each 4} feet long by 2 feet wide by 34 inches high. Pupils of 
small stature are accommodated with movable platforms. The bench tops should be 
2 or 3 inches above the wrist when the pupils stand erect. Benches are arranged in 
rows about 3 feet apart each way.

  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TR? 
Pattern-making equipment.—The joinery benches and tools and wood-turning lathes 
are used for pattern making, a few inside ground gouges being added. 
Molding equipment.—This consists of 12 troughs and sets of tools, with 12 drawers 
for holding work, costing $230. Calcined plaster is used sometimes for pouring. 
Also lead is melted at a furnace built in part by the school. 
Forging equipment.—This consists of 12 forges, 28 by 40 inches; 12 anvils, 125 pounds 
each, and 12 sets of tools, as follows: Hardie, set hammer, 1} inches; flatter, 2} inches; 
top and bottom fullers, each three-eighths, one-half, and three-fourths inch; top and 
bottom swages, each three-eighths, one-half, and three-fourths inch; tongs, each one- 
fourth, three-eighths, one-half, and three-fourths inch ; hot and cold chisels; ball-pein 
hammer, 1} pounds; 2 sledges, 8 pounds; 3 sledges, 6 pounds; 1 sledge, 5 pounds. 
The blower and exhauster driven by power. Cost of forging equipment, $1,200, 
The school has 4 grindstones, costing $65, each of which is furnished with a water 
faucet and with a drip box and pipe connected with sewer. 
Ironwork equipment.—This consists of 6 engine lathes, 6 feet by 14 inches, each 
fitted with a 12 by 7 inch and a three-fourths inch chuck; 1 planer, 4 feet by 20 inches; 
1 drill press, 20 inches; 8 vises and 8 sets of bench tools; an assortment of drills and 
reamers; 1 gig saw; 1 drill lathe; 1 twist drill grinder, and 1 emery stand. The four 
last-mentioned machines were made by the school. 
From 1887 to December, 1891, power was furnished by a 6-horsepower Shipman 
engine. Since the latter date it has been furnished by a 15-horsepower electro- 
motor, manufactured by the Nlektron Manufacturing Company, of Springfield. 
The drawing room, which is in the main high-school building, is supplied with 24 
wooden tables of original design, 24 T squares, 24 pairs of triangles, 50 drawing 
boards, with a rack to hold them, and a case of trays to store drawings, also of origi- 
nal design. Pupils furnish their own drawing instruments. Each table is 36 inches 
high, the dimensions of the top being 34 by 22 inches, and is provided with four 
drawers, 14 by 6} by 3} inches, inside measure, each drawer having a metallic pro- 
jection or staple on the ‘side, corresponding when the drawer is closed to a like projec- 
tion on the side of its pocket, so that the hasp of a small padlock may be thrust 
through the staples, thus enabling pupils who wish to secure each his own instruments. 
Lessons in mechanical drawing are given to grammar pupils in the grammar schools 
by regular teachers, under the direction of the supervisor of drawing. 
Knife-work equipment.—In grade 4 the tools used are rule, pencil, compasses, and 
small pocket. knife. As this work is confined to knife carving, no protection is 
needed for the desk but a small piece of thin wood. 
In grades 5, 6, and 7 the gauge and try-square are added and a larger knife fur- 
nished. A desk cover is necessary in th three grades when the work is pursued 
in the ordinary schoolroom. Each boy has his own set of tools kept in a box made 
of one-fourth inch stock, 8} by 44 by 1,3; inches, with his name and number attached. 
Ten of these boxes are placed at the close of every lesson in a larger box, made of 
one-half inch stock, 25 by 9 by 3} inches, inside dimensions, or in some schools they 
are deposited on suitable shelves, Knives which become dull are sharpened every 
week by a regular workman. 
     
  COURSES OF LESSONS. 
Knife work.—Lessons principally given are described in a book entitled Knife 
Work in the Schoolroom, prepared in 1890 by George B. Kilbon, principal of the 
Manual Training School, and published by the Milton Bradley Company of Spring- 
field. Knife carving, taught in grade 4, has been developed since the preparation of 
that book, and will be found better described in The Northampton System of Man- 
ual Training, arranged by F. W. Hinckley, of Northampton. 
Work done in grades 6 and 7 is on wood five-sixteenths, three-eighths, and one- 
half inch thick, successively. Also forms are cut from wood seven- eighths inch 
square and 13 inches square, with still others of miscellaneous dimensions, 
interspersed with problems in construction. 
Eighth and ninth grammar grade courses.—A. course prepared in 1886 for the ninth 
grammar grade has until recently been used in that grade. This course is described 
in Elementary Wood Work,! prepared by George B. Kilbon. Its contents will be 
found below. The admission of eighth-grade boys to the Manual Training School in 
1892 has caused some changes in this course, as if is now made to cover two years. 
Contents of elementary course for eighth and ninth grammar grades.—Use of hammer, 
use of gauge, measurement, use of try-square:and bevel, explanation of saws, use of 
saws, surface planing, edge and end planing, use of bit ’and brad awls, shove plan- 
ing, square prism and cylinder, use of chisel and gouge, use of hand screw and 
screw-driver, to make a pair of scales, to make a beveled box, grinding tools.

  St. CLoup, MINN. 
[Statement of S. 8. P. 
  , city superintendent.] 
The schools of this city have a system of drawing, sloyd, paper folding, clay 
molding, etc. Tho leading lines are those of drawing and sloyd. These forms of 
training extend through tho cight grades (nine years), The drawing includes the 
simple laws.of perspective, a study of how objects appear to the eye and how they 
must be represented, the geometrical basis of form and drawing, the study of the 
simplest view of historic design, and the application of color in the representation 
of objects. 
The sloyd consists of whittling from the second to and including the sixth grades, 
and tho use of the commoner tools in the seventh and eighth grades, for the produc- 
tion of some forty different models of towel holders, coat supports, brackets, rolling- 
ins, ete. 
3 The immediate purpose is purely an educational one. It seeks to develop skill 
of hand and eye and acquaintance with the simplest principles of mechanical 
construction. 
These courses of instruction are supported the same as other teaching, by appro- 
priations from the public-school funds. There is no charge for tuition. 
  COURSE OF STUDY. 
First grade: Clay modeling, paper folding and cutting, color work, drawing. 
Second grado: Same subjects as fi 
Third grade: Clay modeling, paper folding, cutting, and pasting, color wor 
ings from objects, and whittling. 
Fourth grade: Same subjects as third. 
Fifth grade: Drawing, including shading, simplest laws of ornamentation, whit- 
tling simple models. 
Sixth grade: Same subjects as fifth. 
Seventh grade: Drawing, including shading and perspective, the use of saw, try- 
square, square, jack and smoothing planes, auger and bit, spokeshave, chisel, rasp, 
shaving knife, gauge, sloyd knives and gimlet, working drawings. 
Highth grade: Same as seventh, with addition of leading forms of historic 
ornament. 
The value of the plant (tools) is about $250. 
Tho effect of manual training has heen to give added interest to the work; parents 
tell of mechanical things their children do, showing increased skill in constructive

power. The high school and eighth grade now have more boys than girls, whereas 
~ before the opposite was true. 
The effect has been altogether helpful. The community is apparently well satisfied 
of the utility of what is attempted.

In the fourth and fifth grades the drawing gives but one view of the model. 
In all grades a free-hand sketch is first made of the model, using as many views as 
is necessary to express the facts. The model is then analyzed step by step, and the 
dimensions thus obtained put on the sketch, 
From the data of the sketch the accurate working drawing is made.

MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1033 
CaMDEN, N. J. 
[Statement of Mr. Horatio Draper, supervisor of manual training.] 
The central idea of this work with us is entirely an educational one as distinctive 
from technical or industrial, in the commercial sense. 
In the eight grades of our grammar and primary schools (four grades to each) we 
have a course laid down in manual training thatis obligatory on teachers and pupils. 
The aim and basis of this course is form study—stick and tablet laying, color work, 
drawing with the straightedge and pen from the object, paper cutting, paper fold- 
ing, cardboard, etc., constructions, geometric desigus made of colored papers. 
Through the eight grades we use White’s ‘‘New Course in Art Instruction.” 
In addition to the above, on the girls’ side we require a course in plain sewing, 
based chiefly on Hapgood’s ‘‘Sewing in the Schoolroom.” 
In the high school we have both young men and young women, ranging in age 
from 13 up to 17 years. We have a course of twenty-nine exercises in joinery for 
both sexes; a course in carving in wood with light tools, both sexes; a course in wood 
turning and pattern making—models and patterns of parts of steam engines, etc., 
anvils, tool handles, etc., for the young men only; a course in machine work—chip- 
ping, filing, scraping ete., young men only; a course in tin work—open cylinders, 
telescoping, plain seam and lap seam, cones, pyramids etc., and related forms, as 
cups, elbows, T joints, funnels, pans, etc., for young men omy; a course in forging— 
drawing out, upsetting, welding, ete., for young men only. 
We have a full course in drawing, from the object—orthographic, isometric, and 
scenic projections, free designs, in ink, charcoal, etc., the use of colored washes; the 
study of color— arranging, matching, ete. We make use of the color wheel, and use 
colored inks and colored paper of a fine grade. 
Our wood-working class room is 41 feet long and 18 feet wide. It accommodates 
24 pupils at one time, the classes rotating between the academic class rooms and the 
manual-training class rooms. It contains 12 double benches, each bench supplied 
with planes of foursizes (block, smooth, jack, and fore), aset of chisels one-fourth inch 
up to 1} inch, a claw hammer, a screw-driver, a marking gauge, a 1-foot rule, a 
bench dog, and 1 12-inch backsaw. 
In common 2 cross-cut saws, 2 ripsaws, 1 gluepot, 14 dozen wooden cabinet- 
makers’ clasps, 14 dozen iron clamps of different sizes, 1 grindstone, run by a 5-horse 
power C. & C. motor; 2 Crown power wood Jathes, and a Victor power scroll saw. 
During the first year pupils are confined to the use of hand tools; they are not 
allowed to use the scrollsaw, miter box, or lathe. For carving we use Addis’s sets 
of carving tools—!2 tools to a box; each student is supplied. 
Our metal working class room is about 41 by 18 feet. It contains 3 long, double 
benches for machine work, supplied with 24 Parker vises with brass clamp. Each

We use box tin, solder, muriatic acid, and zine. We find the exercise in tin work 
useful in bringing into play geometric developments and sections. 
All exercises are constructed from drawings done by the students. 
The drawing room accommodates 24 students; it contains 24 adjustable drawing 
desks, racks for 145 drawing boards (25 by 20 inches), 1 rack for clay boards (12 by 
6 inches), clay and plaster of paris. 
Manual training is kept up by the city and State—by special tax the city raises a 
certain amount, and the State appropriates a like amount, only in no case will the 
State appropriate more than $5,000; and the money from both city and State can be 
used for no other purpose than manual training.

1034 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Pupils, with us, are required to furnish for themselves a box of drawing instru- 
ments and from two to three aprons. 
Manual training was started in Camden, February 4, 1891; from that time up to 
date our plant has cost us: Drawing, $719.90; modeling, $1,954.19; sewing, $1,234.75; 
metal work, $1,242.07; woodwork, $1,695.92; carving, $163.84. 
During the year ending June 30, 1896, 129 students were taught the higher grades 
of drawing in the manual training high school; 4,898 males and 5,339 females were 
taught the various exercises in modeling (including drawing) in the eight grades 
of the district schools of the city, and 239 boys and 3,174 girls were taught sewing. 
The cost of manual training for the city during the year, $7,603.98. 
Fifty-one young men and 78 young women were taught joining and carving in the 
manual training high school; 51 young men were taught metal work, including 
forging and tinsmithing, in the manual training high school. 
In sewing there is 1 lesson per week, of 60 minutes; in modeling two lessons per 
week, of 45 minutes each. By modeling we understand all construction work, of 
paper, cutting, etc., including color work; we have no clay work in the district 
schools. 
In.the manual training high school two to four lessons per week, of 45 minutes 
each, in shop work. 
In drawing there are 4 lessons per week, of 45 minutes each. 
Since the introduction of manual training I have noticed a greater interest 
among parents in all school work; that we keep a certain class in school longer, and 
educate a certain element, at least, in accuracy, neatness, etc., that seemed “beyond 
our reach under the old methods. By the manual exercises we awaken an interest 
in and get ahold on this element. Once having roused an interest in the pupil the 
skillful teacher can and does carry that interest over to the ordinary class-room work, 
The number of discipline cases is fewer, and the degree of offense less, 
Montciair, N. J. 
[Statement of Randall Spaulding, city superintendent.] 
The object in all instruction in this department is disciplinary. It is notour aim 
to teach any trade, but simply to train the hand and the eye coordinately, and, 
through them, the mental faculties. We have no objection to teaching useful arts, 
but utility, in a commercial sense, is not our chief aim. Manual training is obliga- 
tory with all pupils of both sexes and in all grades until the high school is reached. 
The work is a part of our public school course for which, of course, no tuition is 
charged. Manual training in New Jersey is subsidized by the State, the State giy- 
ing to the town each year a sum to be devoted to manual training, a sum equal to 
that which is raised for the same purpose by the town itself. The town in order to 
avail itself of the State subsidy must raise at least $500, while $5,000 is the maximum 
that can be received from the State. 
In the sixth to ninth grades inclusive, instruction is given by special teachers and 
in rooms suitably furnished for the purpose. 
We have two buildings. One is a one-story building about 25 by 50 feet and is 
used for carpenter work, wood-carving, lathe-work in wood and metal, and vise- 
work. About twenty-eight sets of carpenter tools are provided and an equal num- 
ber of sets of wood-carving tools. Five wood lathes are furnished and the same 
number of metal lathes for turning, respectively, wood and metal; also a suitable 
number of vises. 
Our other building is of two stories. The first story includes (a) room for cook- 
ing and demonstration, (b) scullery, (c) dining-room. The second floor is devoted 
to advanced work in clay modeling and is suitably fitted up with closets, tables, and 
modeling tools. 
Value of pliant, $8,000; annual oxpense of maintenance, $5,000. 
Interest and proficiency in other studies are, so far as I can judge, secured in quite 
as high degree as before the introduction of manual training. Students in certain 
branches, especially thoso that require the use of apparatus, derive a marked adyan- 
tage from their previous training of the hand andeye. I have no statistics concern- 
ing the effect of manual training upon the length of school life. I believe that the 
effect is not very marked in our town. The town is exclusively residential anda 
very large proportion of tho pupils enter the high school. I have no statistics to 
prove it, but I hold the impression strongly that manual training has had the effect 
of turning many of our boys into such institutions as Steyens Institute and Columbia 
School of Mines; that is, into schools of engineering.

MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1035 
New York, N. Y. 
[Statement of Mr. John Jasper, city superintendent. 
The central idea in the manual training instruction is purely educational and itis 
applied as far as possible from the lowest primary to the highest grammar de. 
“Manual training schools” here are not schools devoted solely to manual instrue- 
tion or training, but they are schools having the full course of instruction, including 
not only subjects in which the hand is trained, but every other branch taught in the 
regular schools. They are maintained in the same way in which the ordinary schools 
are maintained, and no special charge is made for tuition therein. Following is the 
course of study in detail:

  a Tho ages of the males and females are averaged together. b The seventh is a kindergarten grade. 
On December 31, 1895, the number engaged in the several subjects more particu- 
larly relating to amanual training course were as follows: Free-hand drawing, taught 
in all the primary grades (7) and grammar grades (8), 28,331; mechanical drawing, 
taught in all the grammar grades, 11,476; cutting from drawn work, taught in the 
highest primary and the lowest three grammar grades, 8,120; clay modeling, taught 
in the highest primary grades and in all the grammar grades except the highest, 
12,394; sewing, taught to all female pupils in the highest three primary grades and 
the lowest five grammar grades, 7,695; shopwork (in wood), taught to all male pupils 
in the highest five grammar grades, 2,529; cooking, taught to all female pupils in the 
second and third grammar grades, 922; carving (wood), taught to all male pupils 
in the second and third grammar grades, 825. 
Tt should be stated, for the clearer understanding of the course, that clay is used 
in form study by all the primary children excepting those in the first and seventh 
grades; that is, by 14,920 children. Also, the folding and cutting of paper are 
employed in the study of form and design. 
In noting the grades, please to keep in mind the fact that, with the exception of 
the highest grammar grade, the terms are half-yearly. The highest grade in each 
class of schools is called the first. 
The school buildings are similar to those in which the regular course of study is 
pursued, excepting only provision is made for a shop or kitchen, or both, and, in 
some few cases, for a r6om specially fitted up for clay work. 
The manner of keeping the accounts will not permit us to give definite information 
as to cost and annual expense. The purpose of the board is not to separate the   
. manual-training element from but tomake it an integral part of the educational plan. 
We have no means of knowing the occupations of former pupils after leaving 
school. 
CLEVELAND, OHIO. 
[Statement of W. E. Roberts, supervisor of manual training.] 
The fundamental idea in our manual training work is that it isa part of general 
education and not special training, and that its value in public-school work lies in 
its contribution to mental development as a result of hand and eye training. That 
our manual training high schools give excellent preparation for higher technical 
school courses is simply incidental, as is also the industrial side of the question. 
Manual training is obligatory in the first six years of school and optional in the 
two highest grammar grades and the high schools. 
The work is entirely under the direction of the board of education, as a part of 
regular school work, and a special tax levy is provided by State law for its support. 
No charges are made for tuition. Below the high school all supplies are provided 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
    MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1041 
for pupils free of charge. In the high school a charge of $5 per year is made for 
materials used. 
The course of study covers eleven years, beginning with the first year in school 
and ending with the third year of the high school. 
In the first four or primary years the manual tr aining work is based upon the study 
of form by means of clay modeling, paper folding, stick, laying, outlining with needle, 
paper and cardboard construction w ork, and drawing, color and arrangement being 
tanght incidentally. 
In these four grades about 32,000 children receive manual instruction, boys and 
a s working together. The average ages of children in these four grades are 6.6 
.2, and 10.5 5 years, respectively. 
"In the fifth, sixth, ‘and seventh years different lines of work are provided for boys 
and girls. A course in knife work, uiring the use of the simplest tools—the knife, 
rule, try-square, compass, and pencil—is provided for boys, and a course in sewing 
for girls. Inthe eighth year bench work is given to boys and cooking to girls. The 
work of the seventh year is not yet fully developed and in most cases seventh-year 
pupils have had bench work and cooking. 
At present, means are insufticient to extend manual training privileges to all pupils 
of the four grammar grades. About 2,400 now receive instruction in the fifth and 
sixth years and about 1,200 in the seventh and eighth years. The average ages of these grades are 11.5, 12.5, 13.2, and 14 years, respectively. 
We have two high manual training schools. In one of these the work is taken by 
high-school pupils in addition to the work of a high-school course, and in the other 
asa part of a high-school course, in which the manual work counts as a study, or 
may also be taken as additional work by pupils in any course. 
The work for boys consists of wood joinery, wood turning, and pattern making 
the first year, forging and chipping and filing the second year, and machine-tool 
work the third year, with free-hand and mechanical drawing throughout the course. 
For the girls, wood joinery the first year, wood turning and clay modeling aud plaster 
casting the second year, and wood carving and a final project inyolving the ideas of 
the entire course the third year, with drawing each year. 
The high-school work is taught to about 300 pupils of from 14 to 18 years of age. 
All of the work is under the general direction of a supervisor, and an assistant who 
has charge of the work in the four primary grades and the sewing in the fifth, sixth, 
and seventh years. All of the instruction below the seventh grade, or seventh year, 
is given by the regular room teachers, under the direction of the supervisors. 
For the seventh and eighth grades two special teachers of woodwork and two 
teachers of cooking are employed, and for the high schools a principal and six assist- 
ants, the supervisor acting as principal of one of the schools. The time devoted 
to manual training varies from one-half hour per week in the first grade to one and 
one-half hours per week in the eighth grade and seven and one-half hours per week 
in the high school. 
For the seventh and eighth grades four special rooms are provided, two for wood- 
work and two for cooking, to which pupils go from adjacent school buildings. The 
woodworking rooms are each arranged with small benches, sets of simple wood- 
working tools, cupboards, etc., for 20 pupils to work at one time, and the cooking 
rooms each with tables, dishes, ranges, cupboards, etc., for the same number of pupils. 
The Central Manual Training School for high-school pupils, erected in 1893-94, is 
a two-story building with basement, of neat and appropriate design, built especially 
for manual training work. The basement is occupied by the boiler and engine and 
forge shop, arranged for 20 pupils to work together. On the first floor are the offices, 
wood-turning rooms, with benches and lathes for 24 pupils, and the machine shop, 
which is not yet complete in all its details, but which is to have an equipment in 
proportion to that of the other departments. The second floor is occupied by the 
wood-joinery room, with benches and tools for 24 pupils, and two drawing-rooms. 
The West Manual Training School occupies the building formerly used for the West high school, remodeled to meet, as far as possible, the needs of a manual train- 
ing school. The equipment is very similar to that of the Central school, though less 
expensive, and is arranged on a basis of 16 pupils working in a department at one 
time. 
In all of the manual training work all tools and materials are provided for the 
pupils, except that high-school pupils are required to furnish their own drawing 
instruments. 
It is at present impossible to give very accurate estimates of the value of equip- 
ments and buildings. For the four primary grades the permanent equipment is 
small, not exceeding an average value of $10 per building or $450 in all. This would 
include the scissors used in the sewing work of the grammar grades. The knife- 
work equipments of the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades cost about $40 per building, 
or about $320 for the work now in operation. The present equipment of the two 
eighth grade wood-working rooms cost $300 each, and of each of the cooking rooms       
    
     
          
-P-A-G-E-84
1042 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
$240, making a total of $1,400 for equipment of grammar grade work. The Central 
Manual Training building cost about $27,000. An estimate of the cost of equipment 
can not be given. The equipment of the West Manual Training School cost about 
$6,000. 
Tho annual cost of supplies—clay, paper, paste, ete.—for the work of the four pri- 
mary grades, as at present conducted, is about 2 cents per pupil. For the knifework 
and sewing of the grammar grades, supplies cost about 54 cents per pupil per year, 
and for tho grammar grado bench work and cooking about 30 cents per pupil. No 
estimate of high- school supplies that would be of value can be given. 
Our manual “training work is so new in the lower grades that but little system- 
atic information has been collected as to its effect upon other school studies, 
‘Teachers are finding it a means of gaining the attention of classes not in this work 
alone, but that its influence in this direction is extended to other school work. Many 
instances are noted of pupils whose interest in school has begun with manual train- 
ing and has been extended through its means to other lines of work. A point of 
particular interest noted is the power of pupils in advanced work who have had 
a year’s training to think and act clearly and decisively for themselves and to 
anticipate and describe the steps in a process. 
In connection with the high-school work there have been better opportunities for 
observation, and more definite statements can be made. It is certainly safe to assert 
that in general the influence of manual training upon other school work is good, 
and in a large number of particular cases that have been observed the final and suc- 
cessful completion of school work was due to manual training. Many have con- 
tinued in high school until the manual training work was completed who would 
otherwise have stopped with or before the completion of the first year, and some 
have been led by its means to complete the high+school course and go on to higher 
education. 
As yet it is difficult to judge much of ihe influence upon the occupations of former 
graduates. Of those that it has been possible to follow, a very large per cent are 
now in classical or technical colleges. Of those remaining all, so far as is at present 
known, aro filling positions principally in mechanical work.

TOLEDO, OHr0. 
TOLEDO MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOL, 
[From the Tenth Annual Report of the Directors, 1894-95.] 
The organization of this school was made possible through the bequest of a citizen 
of Toledo, the late Jesup H. Scott. Mr. Scott had, during his life, an intense appre- 
ciation of the value of trained intelligence in industrial affairs. It was also his 
desire to elevate labor and the laboring men to a higher plane, and clotho both with 
more dignity and respect. For these reasons he had cherished the idea of founding, 
at some time, a university of arts and trades. A short time before his death Mr. 
Scott matured his plan of the Toledo University of Arts and Trades, and conveyed 
to trustees of the same, as an endowment fund, valuable lands lying adjacent to the 
city of Toledo. This fund was afterwards greatly increased by gifts by the sons of 
Mr. Scott. Mr. William H. Raymond also Benerounly, contributed to the fund a sum 
of $15,000. But in 1884, owing to some adverse circumstances, the trustees found 
they would be unable to realize the purposes of the donors on the projected scale, and 
so made a tender of the entire university property to the city of Toledo on condition 
that the city would assume the trust under the powers and obligations imposed by 
the statutes of Ohio. 
In March, 1884, the common council of Toledo accepted the trust in behalf of the 
city, a new board of trustees was appointed, and the department of manual training 
was organized as a part of the public school system, to be managed jointly by tho 
university trustees and the board of education. In October, 1884, the manual train- 
ing work began in an experimental way in the rooms of the high school building. 
The work began with a class of 60 boys and girls, under the instructions of but one 
teacher. For tho first year the only studies pursued were carpentry or light wood- 
work, and free-hand and mechanical drawing. But so popular and useful seemed 
the work, and so eager were others to enter upon it, that it became necessary greatly 
to enlarge the facilities for these studies. 
The school is now completing its tenth year of work. It has proved itself useful 
and popular, and may be regarded as haying passed beyond the experimental stage 
of its history and become a fixture in the educational system of Toledo. 
EXPENSES. 
For the residents of Toledo instruction in the manual training school is free like 
the other public schools, a small charge for material only being made as follows: The 
first year, $6; the second, $7.50; the third and fourth years, $9 each; payable in three 
installments at the beginning of the fall, winter, and spring terms. 
For nonresidents of Toledo, tuition, including high school fee and regular material 
fee, is charged as follows, payable in the same manner as above: For the boys, first 
year, $45; second year, $60; third and fourth years, $75 each. For the girls, first 
and second years, $45 each; third and fourth years, $60 each. 
The work of the student is the property of the school, but may be given to the 
pupil at the discretion of the superintendent. 
THE BUILDING AND EQUIPMENTS FOR MANUAL INSTRUCTION. 
The building for manual instruction is 60 by 120, and four full stories in height. 
The drafting rooms occupy the fourth floor of the east half of the building and_one- 
half of the west wing on the ground floor. These rooms are admirably lighted and

fitted with blackboards, drawing tables, and closet racks, so that the pupils haye~ 
each a place to put away their work, as class after class successively occupy the 
rooms. As drawing is the foundation for almost every species of correct mechanical 
work, students of the manual school continue to work in these rooms from the 
beginning to the end of their school course. 
The woodworking department oceupies two rooms, one on the third and one below 
it on the second story, each 40 by 55 feet. The former contains 1 jig saw, 12 heavy 
double work benches, with full sets of tools for each pupil, and is equipped to accom- 
modate four classes of 24 students each per day. The second-floor room contains 
the samo equipment as the third-floor room, and in addition 24 improved wood- 
turning lathes and 1 emery grinder. The former room receives the boys of the first- - 
year course, and the latter the boys of the second-year course. A complete equip- 
ment of belting and gearing moves all the saws and lathes in the woodworking 
rooms, 
The wood-carving and clay-modeling room is 40 by 27 feet, has plenty of light, and 
is equipped with 12 suitable benches, with racks and cases designed especially for 
wood carving and clay modeling. As in all other departments, each pupil has his 
own tools and drawer. 
The forging room occupies the whole of the ground floor on the east side, and is a 
room 40 by 55, 12 feet high. ‘The room is well lighted and is equipped with 18 forges 
and anvils, with all needed tools for each, and benches, vises, grindstones, emery 
stones, ete, A system of galvanized-iron pipes is over all the forges, and a large 
exhaust fan ventilates into large chimneys. The forge blast is obtained by means 
of a power blower. 
The machine shop is a room 40 by 55, 12 feet in height. It has an equipment of 8 
Putnam engine lathes, 2 speed lathes, 2 drill presses, a good-sized planer, a shaper, 
an excellent universal milling machine, 1 power hack saw, an emery grinder, and a 
grindstone. Vises of the most improved pattern are fixed upon benches placed 
under the windows of the room. 
In the domestic economy department, opposite the drawing rooms on the fourth 
floor, and occupying the whole of the west half of the building, are the cooking and 
textile-fabric rooms, lighted by side and skylight, warmed by steam, and perfectly 
ventilated. 
The cooking room is equipped with two large ranges and 2 gas cooking stoves, 5 
double tables, each made to accommodate 4 pupils ; each pupil has her own table space 
for work, and a small gas stove on the table between each two, the accommodations 
being for classes of 20. Each table has 4 drawers, and cupboards below for all 
essential utensils. At the end of the room are pantry closets and a commodious 
wash room, with all conveniences for girls, including individual closets for each to 
keep aprons, clothes, ete. 
The textile-fabric room is equipped with furniture and appliances for teaching 
domestic handiwork in the cutting and making of garments, house furnishing, hand 
and machine sewing, ete. 
The boiler and coal room is under the sidewalk of Tenth street, in a vaulted room 
especially adapted to the purpose. The boiler is a 70-horse power steel tubular, 
d furnishes power to run the engine and steam to heat the entire building. A 
-horsepower Ball engine, the source of power for all the shops, occupies a place 
in the main hall on the ground floor, and instruction is given the pupils in the use 
and care of the boiler and engine in all their details; and these, as well as the force 
pump, feed water, heater, hot-water receiver, and steam apparatus, are all used to 
illustrate the generation and application of steam.

  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1049 
DOMESTIC ECONOMY. 
SEWING. 
The educational value of sewing, training the eye and hand, developing ingenuity, 
precision, patience, and industry, cultivating good taste, love of beauty, and appro- 
priateness of dress make it an approved means of all-around culture, while the ease 
with which it is introduced as an exercise into the regular class room, and the small 
cost of material and instruction, give it some advantage over other forms of manual 
training. The following outline indicates the course of instruction: 
Hand work.—Basting, running, backstitching, overcasting, hemming, damask hem, 
reversible seam, fell, overseaming, flannel seam, ruffle, patch, darning, buttonholes, 
glove mending. 
Machine work.—Use and care of the machine, hemming, tucking, gathering; pat- 
terns made from actual measurements; cutting and making of drawers, skirts, and 
nightgowns; instructions concerning manufacture of pins, thread, cotton, linen, etc, 
DRESSMAKING. 
Dressmaking is taken by pupils of the senior high-school class. To enter this 
grade the pupils are required to have taken the work in sewing of the junior year, 
‘The time given to dressmaking is one hour and a half each day during the school 
year. When a pupil finishes her work before the rest of the class, she is allowed to 
do extra work. No work is required to be done at home. Practice material and the 
appliances with which to work are supplied by the school, and the garments are 
selected and furnished by the pupils. Two girls work together and each one is 
responsible for the measuring and fitting of the other’s dress. 
First term.—Making buttonholes with twist; sewing on buttons, hooks and eyes, 
and loops; talks on choice of material, color and designs for dresses; taking measures 
for skirt; drafting a skirt; making a dress skirt of plain material; taking meas- 
ures for a basque; drafting a basque; making a basque of plain material: taking 
measures for a sleeve; drafting a sleeve; making sleeves for the basque; examina- 
tion; sketching objects in outline and in light and shade; sketching from life. 
Sccond term.—Talks on the nature and manufacture of woolen textiles; cutting 
from patterns; making stripes and figures; making a dressing jacket or basque to 
apply matching; drafting a waist with two under arm pieces; planning a princess 
dress; talks on the growth and manufacture of silk; sketches, in water color and 
pencil, of gowns. 
Third term.—Make a dress; talks on the manufacture of cloth; examination; mak- 
ing a wash dress and shirt waist; examination; designing of costumes.     
Cooxine. 
The design of this course is to furnish thorough instruction in applied house- 
keeping and the sciences relating thereto, and students will receive practical drill 
in all branches of housework; in the purchase and care of family supplies, and in 
general household management; but will not be expected to perform more labor than 
is actually necessary for the desired instruction. 
The social, hygienic, and economic questions involved in such instruction are of 
the greatest practical concern, and it is believed that the careful and systematic 
teaching needed in this branch of study will yield the best possible educational 
results. 
In the high-school classes four practice lessons and one in the theory and chemistry 
of cooking are given each week. The practice lessons include all the operations of 
a kitchen, and cover the following instruction and practice: (1) Boiling, (2) baking, 
(3) broiling, (4) frying, (5) mixing. 
1. Boiling.—Boiling and simmering water and its action on starch and albumen. 
Practical application of facts thus learned to boiling of meats for soups, for stews, 
and to be served whole, to vegetables, eggs, and beverages. 
2. Baking.—Bread raised with yeast. Bread raised with baking powder. Meats, 
pies, puddings, cakes, vegetables, and fish. 
3. Broiling.—Steaks, chops, fish, oysters, etc.

  MANUAL INSTRUCTION IN WARD-SCHOOL CLASSES. 
SEWING. 
In October, 1894, there were 88 classes organized in 20 ward-school buildings, with 
an enrollment of 2,318. The average attendance.during the year was 1,871. Nineteen 
special teachers were employed, with Miss Olive Parmelee as supervisor. In addi- 
tion to 1,766 pieces of work completed in school, 2,948 were completed at home, and 
12,528 stockings were darned, and 9,126 garments mended. 
On every side is seen a growing appreciation of the great importance of this branch 
of education. Those most interested desire to see this work made compulsory. 
This work in the ward schools consists of four different courses: The beginners, 
second, third, and boys’ course.

CooxIna. 
In December, 1893, classes in cooking were first organized. The course comprises 
one lesson each week for a period of thirty-six weeks, each lesson being an hour and 
a half in duration. 
Practical instruction is given in boiling, broiling, baking, frying, and mixing, as 
illustrated in the preparation of soups, cereals, vegetables, meats, pastry, cakes, 
breads, desserts, etc. 
A study is made of the nutritive properties of the commonest foods, the effect of 
heat upon different substances, the action of yeast or its substitutes upon breads, 
and the approximate money value of materials used. 
During the lesson some branch of domestic work other than cooking is considered, 
as care of the kitchen, cellar, and sink, washing and wiping dishes, sweeping, dust- 
ing, scrubbing, washing windows, setting and cleaning off the table, serving at 
table, waiting at door, ete. 
At the close of a term a breakfast, luncheon, or dinner is cooked and served by the 
girls of each class. 
The following is the course of lessons:

PHILADELPHIA, Pa, 
[From a report on woodwork in grammar schools, by Edward Brooks, city superintendent, 1893.] 
In the development of the manual training idea Philadelphia has not been behind 
her sister cities. In 1880 the board of education introduced sewing as a regular 
branch of study into the girls’ high and normal school. This experiment was found 
so satisfactory that in 1885 sewing was added to the course of study of the elemen- 
tary schools of the city, In the same line of progress, cooking w rtroduced into 
the grammar grades for girls in 1887—a movement that has been productive of most 
excellent results. In 1880 a course in woodwork, devised by Mr. Charles G. Leland, 
was adopted by the board, represented to-day by the carving exercises at the Indus- 
trial Art School, tho earliest institution of its kind in America. In 1885 the boys’ 
manna, training school was established, the phenomenal success of which has occa- 
sioned the organization of a second similar school and given a wide reputation to 
our city in that line of work. An experiment was also made last year in sloyd work 
in the James Forten Elementary Manual Training School. 
THE PHILADELPHIA MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOL, 
  [From the tenth annual catalogue, 1895-96.] 
The Philadelphia Manual Training School is an institution of high-school grade, 
forming an integral part of the public school system of Philadelphia. It was organ- 
ized in September, 1885, with a class of 180 pupils. So rapid was its growth that at 
the end of three years there were no accommodations for many candidates properly 
qualified for admission. In order to meet the demands of those desirous of availing 
themselves of the ‘“‘new education,” a second school was organized September, 1889, 
in the northeastern part of the city. These two schools have separate principals and 
faculty, and thus constitute independent establishments. They are under the direc- 
tion of different committees of the board of public education, but they pursue, as far 
as possible, parallel courses of study. 
They are open to boys who have completed the course in the twelfth grade of 
the grammar schools. Boys from private schools who successfully pass the annual 
examination in June for admission may also be admitted. 
This school affords an opportunity to pursue the usual high-school course in liter- 
ature, science, and mathematics, and at the same time to receive u thorough course 
in drawing and in the use and application of tools. 
The object of a manual training school is the education of all the faculties, and 
not the training of any special group. The boy is trained esthetically, mentally, and 
physically. It is meant that the school shall help each pupil to enter upon his 
advanced or special training with the best economy of time and with some concep- 
tion of his fitting occupation. 
It should be borne in mind that a manual training school is not a trade school. 
The name, unfortunately, is misleading. In the school there are five departments— 
literature, mathematics, science, drawing, and manual training. The name of one   
   department,has been made to cover all, and this misnomer is responsible for much of 
the current misapprehension concerning the work and purpose of the school. It is,   
  however, a name so firmly rooted in our school nomenclature that if would, per- 
haps, be unwise to attempt to eradicate it. It only remains for us to give the name a 
broader meaning and to associate with it in the public mind the full scheme of 
high-school culture of which it forms a part. 
it is not the purpose of this school, therefore, to produce mechanics any more than 
it is to produce any other class of specialists. What it aims to do is to surround 
boys with the realities of lifein both thoughts and things, and to fit them more 
closely to their environment. It is a system of education which is perfectly general 
in its character, and which is recommended with the same confidence to the future 
student of the humanities as to the prospective worker in force and matter.

  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1053 
COURSE OF STUDY. 
The course of study covers three years. The school time of the pupils is about 
equally divided between literary and manual work. One hour per day is given to 
drawing, two hours to shop work, and three hours to the usual academic studies. 
‘The course of study embraces tive parallel lines, as follows: 
First.—A course in language and literature, including the structure and use of 
English, composition, literature, history, economics, German, and French. 
Second.—A course in mathematics, including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigo- 
nometry, bookkeeping, and surveying. ; 
Third.—A course in science, including geology, physics, chemistry, physiology, 
mechanics, steam engineering, and applied electricity. 
Fourth.—A course in freehand, constructive, and agricultural drawing, designing, 
and modeling. 
Fifth.—A course of tool instruction, including joinery, parquetry, pattern making, 
wood turning, wood carving, forging, soldering, ornamental ironwork, molding and 
casting, vise work, and mechanical instruction. 
Post-graduate course ( fourth year).—A post-graduate course has been added to the 
curriculum of the school. This course is elective, and is intended for those graduates 
who wish to pursue an extended course in literature, history, mathematics, and the 
sciences, thus giving them a full and rounded literary course equal to that of any 
high school. 
It will enable those who satisfactorily complete the course to enter the more 
advanced classes of a 2ollegiate course, and it also provides adequate training for those 
graduates who wish to pursue a special course as a preparation for the teaching 
profession. 
COURSE IN DRAWING. 
The importance of drawing in its application to manual training can not be over- 
estimated. It is, in fact, the first step in manual training. Without drawing, the 
use of tools becomes a mere mechanical imitation and has little value as an e:iuca- 
tional factor. From the conception of the idea to its expression in the concrete 
material, the drawing is the description by which the mechanical processes are logi- 
cally developed and brought tova definite and practical form. 
From the beginning, ther efore, the pupil is taught to make and interpret working 
drawings and to reproduce from them the indicated forms. He must understand 
this universal language in which they are described, and acquire by education and 
experience the ability to use it. 
Parallel with this work, the pupil’s powers of observation and expression and his 
artistic sense are cultivated by the study and representation of the appearance of 
objects, and by designing on paper and in clay and wood for their ornamentation. 
While drawing underlies all industrial work, its application is not limited to mate- 
rial purposes. Throughout all the departments drawing is the common language 
used in explaining facts, ideas, and principles. By means of historical, botanical, 
and topographical maps, literary and economic charts, physical and mechanical dia- 
grams, anatomical and geological sketches, the pupil graphically expresses the lessons 
taught in the class room. 
The course in drawing has three general divisions: 
First. Constructive drawing, as the basis of all industrial pursuits. 
Second. Representative drawing, designed to educate the sense of form and pro- 
portion, to train the eye to observe accurately and the hand to delineate rapidly the 
appearance of objects. 
Third. Decorative drawing, used as a means of cultivating the taste and develop- 
ing an appreciation and love of the beautiful.    
COURSE IN TOOL INSTRUCTION, 
In this department, which is a distinctive feature of the school, each exercise 
involves a mechanical principle, and the chief object of the instruction is the deyvel- 
opment of this principle rather than a finished piece of work. The exercise has 
value only as it has rendered educational service during its construction. In the 
changing conditions of the thing in hand during its construction there is a constant 
necessity for creating new means to meet new requirements, and the directive skill 
and logical processes thus evolved make manual training rise to the level of scientific 
or mathematical studies as a means of intellectual development. 
Other values of a specific nature—accuracy of measurement, precision of adjust- 
ment, delicacy of manipulation, exactness in every particular—must be taken into 
account in estimating the educational value of manual work. 
The shop instruction is simply a part of the laboratory methods of education. The 
term ‘‘shop” in this connection is as much of a misnomer as is the term ‘‘manual

training” when applied to the whole school. It would seem more fitting, therefore, 
in speaking of this department to call it a laboratory, a term which carries with it 
the educational significance of its work. 
All the articles made in the shops are required to be of precise forms and dimen- 
sions given in a drawing made by the pupil himself previous to taking up the exer- 
cise. The aim is to teach the pupil to express his thought in a concrete form with 
the least waste of material, in the most workmanlike manner, and in accordance 
with the most approved methods. 
A feature of the work in the manual training departments is a weekly lecture 
bearing either upon the principles involved in the work of the week or the nature of 
_ the material used in construction.

OCCUPATIONS OF GRADUATES, 
An examination of the records of the 520 graduates reveals the fact that the claims 
made by the school as to its practical value in gaining a livelihood are fully sub- 
stantiated, about 70 per cent being engaged in those pursuits in which a high order 
of intelligence, as well as skill of hand, is required. Already a large number occupy 
positions of trust and responsibility, as superintendents, managers, foremen, etc. 
That the school fosters a desire for higher education is shown in the fact that about 
Snes cent of the graduates are students in colleges, universities, or technical 
schools. 
‘The occupations are classified as follows: Teachers, 17; physicians, 5; law stu- 
dents, 8; dentists, 2; surgeon (veterinary), 1; civil engineers, 6; electrical engi- 
neers, 13; mechanical engineers, 7; architects, 10; machinists, 7; engravers, 5;

  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1057 
INDUSTRIAL ART SCHOOL, 
[From the report of J. Liberty Tadd, principal, for 1890.] 
The school was first started in 1880, permission having been obtained of the board 
of public education by Mr. Charles G. Leland for the use of certain rooms in the 
Hollingsworth Building for the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility and practi- 
eability of training the mind and hand of our youth at one and the same time. The 
school was but an experiment, and there being no appropriation for its maintenance 
the board had nothing to offer but the use of the rooms. 
Through the enterprise of Mr. Leland, however, these obstacles were easily over- 
come, and the school was opened with 120 children, who came every Tuesday and 
Thursday afternoons for two hours, permission first having been obtained to absent 
themselves from their regular schools. 
The results of ‘the first year were more gratifying than was even hoped for, and it 
was not long before the school had passed its experimental stage. 
The following year the educational board took charge of this new departure in 
education; regular teachers were appointed and the school placed upon a permanent 
basis, with more than double the number of pupils in attendance. 
Since then it has grown in numbers and enlarged facilities provided, until now the 
number receiving instruction each week has reached almost 1,700, embracing pupils 
from the lowest primary grades to the highest grades in the grammar school, as well 
as the teachers’ classes. The annual cost per pupil is but $3.50. Of course, with the 
experience attained since the opening of the school, there have been material changes 
in the methods employed, a regular graded course of instruction has been adopted, 
new graded series of plaster casts have been provided, and in many minor details has 
the equipment of the schoo! been improved. 
The four fundamental principles now employed in the school are: 
First. Free-hand drawing in its simplest form, or, as it might be called, delineation 
on a flat surface. For instance, we make on the blackboard a circle, one of the ele- 
mentary forms in use. In making this circle the pupils are taught to swing their 
hands around without support, to get the motion and to make a clear-drawn circular 
line. When any simple form can be put down at a stroke, we have acquired a cer- 
tain amount of manual training of a most desirable kind. Pupils are tanght to make 
all elementary forms in this manner. 
Second. To make those elementary forms in soft clay. 
Third, To make those same forms in the opposite of soft clay, i. e., tough wood. 
Fourth. Designing, creating forms on flat surfaces, in soft clay, and in tough wood. 
By these four processes the pupils are taught to draw simple forms, to memorize 
them sufficiently to put them in any direction, thus creating original designs and 
then to carry out the idea in clay or wood. 
There are to-day nearly two hundred and fifty trades, and there is not one of them 
that does not have one of these four principles as a fundamental element; for if the 
eye, the hand, and judgment—all tools—are well trained, the tools of any trade will 
be freely handled, and with reason.

The number of pupils (teachers) enrolled in teachers’ manual training classes for 
the fall term of 1895 was as follows: Elementary drawing, 45; advanced drawing, 31; 
elementary modeling, 22; advanced modeling, 10; wood carving, 22; post-graduate 
classes, 41; total, 171. 
Ihave addressed a circular letter to our graduates for the years 1890, 1891, 1892, 
and 1893, in order that we might obtain some permanent record of the results of the 
public industrial art training. 
From the answers already received I find that the pupils still pursuing their 
studies at the public schools are distributed as follows:

Institute, 3; ‘Temple College, 2; University of Pennsylvania, 3. 
These figures do not include the pupils provided for by the city scholarships at 
theso different schools. 
The total number of answers received to our letters was 130, and among all these 
graduates of the Public Industrial Art School 14 are now earning their living at some 
artistic pursuit, either as engravers, designers, interior decorators, or lithographers.

JAMES FORTEN ELEMENTARY MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOL, 
[From the report of Hannah A. Fox, principal, for 1895.] 
The majority of the pupils of the school are of Russian parentage, and many upon 
entering have no knowledge of the English language. ‘Twenty-two per cent of the 
whole number enrolled were colored. 
Our aim has been to blend the work of the kindergarten into the higher grades, 
In the kindergarten, elementary knowledge in many branches is begun, and an 
attempt has been made to carry on progressively these beginnings in the grades that 
follow. For instance, card sewing with worsteds is one of the occupations of the 
kindergarten. A systematic arrangement of advanced card sewing with worsteds 
is therefore taught in the first grade. It has been found that this drill prepares the 
pupils to begin with ease the regular course of sewing in the second grade, conse- 
quently there is no break in pursuing this branch from the kindergarten till the 
pupils leave school. The same plan is carried out in a sequential order in paper 
folding, paper cutting, parquetry, form making, and drawing. 
Simple science leaeoien in physiology, geology, zoology, botany, and chemistry are 
tanght in each grade. 
The lessons in yocal music are continued, and are a pleasant and helpful 
feature.*..*.* 
In the cookery department 61 girls from this school have received training and 383 
girls from neighboring grammar schools. ‘The attendance is good; the girls seem to 
be glad to avail themselves of the opportunity for drill in order, cleanliness, and the 
simple, wholesome preparation of food. 
In the sloyd department 70 boys and 27 girls from this school have received train- 
ing and 90 boys from neighboring grammar schools. ‘The pupils appear to consider 
this work a recreation. They are always willing to remain after school hours to 
complete unfinished work. While the manipulation of the tools is regarded as the 
more interesting by the younger children, the working drawing, which in the 
advanced stage requires thoughtful consideration and nicety of execution, is preferred 
by the older ones. * * 
In the early days of the school, before all the rooms were needed for classes, one 
was reserved for sewing. Here all the necessary materials were kept, and the girls 
met for their lessons in this branch as in an ordinary sitting room. Now the mate- 
rials are placed in closets in different parts of the building, and the sewing is taught 
in the classrooms. Ifa room for sewing purposes could be added to the building, 
the former more convenient and pleasant plan would be resumed, 
    SEWING. 
[From the course of instruction in sewing, 1993.] 
Instruction in sewing was introduced into the girls’ high and normal school in 
1880. The experiment was so satisfactory that in 1885 arrangements were made for 
a general introduction of the subject into the elementary schools of the-city 
Instruction is given to the girls in all the grades above the- miritiarye key is, 
beginning with the third year of the school system. 
Special teachers are employed. These are assigned to districts comprising adja- 
cent schools, and they perform their duties in accordance with programmes which 
are arranged by the principals ot the several girls’ schools and the sewing teachers. 
There are at present over 1,800 girls in the high and normal school, and about 
58,000 girls in the elementary schools, who receive regular instruction’ in sewing. 
There are 41 special sewing teachers employed in the public schools of the city. 
The city of Philadelphia provides each pupil with needles, pins, thimble, scissors, 
button-hole scissors, cotton (both for sewing and darning), dressmaker’s scales, 
emery bags, and paper for drafting patterns. Muslin, bleached and unbleached, is 
also furnished, A square foot of this is given at first to each pupil, and the quantity 
is repeated as soon as the amount given is used. The city allows 6 cents per annum 
for each child engaged in sewing. 
Garments to be made or mended are also brought from their homes by the pupils. 
  COURSE OF INSTRUCTION FOR THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
Third school year—first half.—Position: The proper position of the body during 
sewing. The correct method of using the thimble finger, the first finger and the

hemming. Teach the method of fastening a new thread in the progress of the hem. 
Overseaming: Overseaming on turned edges. Teach how to fasten the thread in 
beginning this seam, and how to fasten a new or a broken thread. Cutting: Teach 
pupils to cut to a straight-line. Pupils who sew reasonably well may bring towels, 
wash rags, and similar articles to be hemmed. 
Notr,—Pupils should be required in all the grades to express in correct English 
all that has been taught.

    II.—_MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
THROOP POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE, PASADENA, CAL., 
[Statement of Charles H. Keyes, president.] 
    The Throop Polytechnic Institute, of Pasadena, Cal., was founded by Hon. Amos 
G. Throop in 1891. The institute comprises three distinct departments—a sloyd 
school, a manual training academy, and a college department. Manual training is 
one of the leading characteristics of the institute, 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  1062 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The primary idea in the work is educational rather than preparatory for higher 
technical study. It chances, however, that a large number of students come to us 
and after taking our work for two or three years go out to labor successfully as 
tradesmen and mechanics, To that extent the school is incidentally a successful 
teacher of some trades. None of our manual training work is obligatory, although 
more than 280 of the 313 students take some manual training. 
The institution is independent of all other schools or institutions beyond keeping 
up its relationship for admission of students from public schools and the transfer of 
students to Berkeley and Stanford. It has a prospective endowment of about $60,000 
when the final decree of distribution of the Throop estate shall be received. Beyond 
this it depends for its support upon the tuition, which for the ensuing year is $105, 
and upon the gifts and donations solicited for its support. During the last two 
years we have secured $49,630 in the shape of gifts. 
The total plant is valued at about $110,000. The annual expense of maintenance 
varies from $25,000 to $30,000. 
The very large election of subject-matter under the advice of teachers and parents 
is characteristic of our work from the secondary school age upward. Attention to 
the peculiar wants and demands of progress of the individual made possible by 
peeping the number of pupils in a class below 25 is also a peculiar feature of our 
work, 
  SHOPWORK. 
Woodwork.—The work is given to the student by means of a blue print taken from 
aworking drawing. From these he constructs his model. These drawings are made 
with the greatest care and accuracy. Helpful notes in reference to the work accom 
pany each drawing. This method acquaints the student with the reading of accurate 
working drawings and the working therefrom. After the model has been made, he 
then makes his own working drawing from it. 
The course in joinery is composed of eighteen progressive ex ises, involving the 
construction of sixteen different joints, the drawing of analytical and free-hand 
curves, and the use of fifty different tools and machines. 
The student is allowed to exercise his individuality ir. the exercises in inlaying 
and cabinetwork. These exercises are made from his own drawings and after his 
own designs, which are submitted to the instructor before the work is begun. 
The course in turning consists of fifteen progressive exercises given in the follow- 
ing order: Center work, face-plate work, chucked work, and long work. 
The problems in woodwork are taken in the order of joinery, inlaying, turning, 
and eabinetwork. This work is calculated to be finished by the average student 
in one school year, working one and one-half hours daily. 
At the end of the year there will be held a written examination upon the methods 
employed and the technical terms used in the work. 
Forging.—Mechanism of and care of forge; preparatior of forge for fire; building 
and managing fire. 
Instruction in the care and use of tools. 
The processes involved in the year’s work are: Drawing, bending, upsetting, 
different kinds of welding, punching, drilling, fullering, swaging, cutting cold, chip- 
ping, cutting hot, splitting, twisting, filing, brazing, hardening, tempering, and 
ornamental ironwork. 
Hardening in water and oil, tempering or drawing, temperatures and colors used, 
and processes in tempering tools for wood and iron work. 
At the close of the year each student will be required to design some special piece 
involving the various elements of forging mastered. 
Pattern making and machine work.—Vhe work in pattern making alternates with 
that in the machine shop. The course commences with the simpler forms of pattern 
making embodying the fundamental principles of the subject, such as allowance for 
shrinkage, finish, etc. Later, more difficult work is taken up, involving core making. 
Each student is expected to make for himself or assist in making patterns for a 
finished piece of work. For example, during the past year one student has made 
patterns for a breech-loading brass cannon, 20 inches in length; another, a full set 
of patterns for an 8-inch swing wood lathe; another, a set of patterns for a 2-horse- 
power waterwheel—Pelton style; another, a set of patterns for a gas engine of new 
design; the balance of the class have made a full set of patterns for a 4-horsepower 
automatic steam engine with valve of new design. 
One molding bench is provided where the students test their patterns. 
Work in machine shop comprises chipping and filing, use of taps and dies, reamers, 
ete., hand-tool work in speed lathes, work on engine lathes, turning, boring, screw- 
cutting—outside and in. 
During the course each student will work on the following machines, besides the 
lathes: Planer, shaper, drill press, and milling machine. AJ] special tools are made 
by the students and tested with micrometer calipers.     
-P-A-G-E-105
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1063 
Special attention is given to accuracy in measurement, finish of work, care of 
tools and machines. 
Example of work done during the past year: Making planer bolts, face plates for 
wood lathes, mounting chucks, finishing of castings made from patterns in above 
list. Three engines are being made from the steam-engine patterns, one of which has 
been finished as class work; the other two are being made by two students, each one 
doing the entire work on the engine alone. 
Plain sewing tive days a week, two periods a day. The fundamental principles of 
hand sewing, basting, running, hemming, hemstifching, tucking, felling, sewing 
on lace, darning, ete. Machine sewing. Plain stitching, hemming, tucking, and 
gathering. Continuation of plain sewing. Practical experience in shopping by each 
pupil. Neatness and accuracy demanded in the work. 
During the year a complete suit of underwear must be made by each pupil; also 
a shirt waist, a cotton dress, and a wrapper or dressing sacque. Same preliminary 
study in designing for the dressmaking course will be done. 
Modeling and carving.—Modeling of simple leaf forms, followed by the various styles 
of historic crnament from the cast and from the flat, including original designs, masks, 
busts, and bas relief. Instruction in the principles of decorative designs as applied 
to wood, metal, and stone, the principles of form and proportion involved in designs 
of various kinds, and the adaptation of modeled ornament to different surfaces. 
Instruction in the care of tools; their use by practice in cutting to a line and to a 
given depth; Egyptian.and Greek ornament studied and expressed by lining and incis- 
ing; the Moorish, Byzantine, Romanesque, Gothic-Roman, and Renaissance styles im 
succession, advancing from simplest to more complicated forms. 
Specialwork on busts and full-length figures from the antique, the successful com- 
pletion of one of the latter being required of each pupil who receives the regular 
eredits for this course. 
The principles of design studied by taking the scroll framework as a basis for 
developing surface patterns, continuous scrolls, and the various form of radiating 
designs; practical application of these principles to designing and ornamenting fur- 
niture, such as easels, stools, chairs, jardinieres, bedsteads, desks, etc. The suc- 
cessful completion of a piece in Italian Renaissance is required of all students before 
they receive the regular credit for this course. The growth of woods and their 
adaptability for various uses is studied, and pupils are taught to select material and 
have it cut and dressed. They are also instructed in working drawings, light car- 
pentry, and in finishing work in various styles of polish. 
Carving in the round is begun with work on heads, and followed by full-length 
figures. 
“Cunenge Ths fundamental principles of cookery and practice in the preparation 
of vegetables, soups, meats, cereals, biscuits, eggs, cost of materials; care of a 
kitchen; serving a simple dinner. 
Instruction in preparation of more complicated dishes; bread, fish, oysters, pastry, 
croquettes, game, etc.; care of silver and glass; setting and serving a table; table 
etiquette. 
Entrees, salads, desserts, cake, jellies, and creams; giving of entire breakfasts, 
luncheons, and dinners; ordering; proportions of food needed; garnishing; short 
course in invalid cookery; carving. 
Presentation of the physiology of nutrition by special lecturer. 
In connection with cookery, the following topics will be taken up: Classification 
of foods; water, boiling, simmering, its action on starch and albumen; practical 
application in cooking meats and vegetables; composition of foods; the cheapest 
and most wholesome foods; tho greatest amount of nutriment obtained for 25 cents; 
digestion, assimilation; study of yeast plant; properties of carbonic-acid gas; fer- 
mentation, lactic, vinous, acetic; baking powders, soda, cream of tartar; flour,

care of every portion of a house; preparation of a dietary for six persons for one 
week, not to exceed $10; invalid cookery, dietary; tablo etiquette; duties of a cook; 
duties of waitress; special lectures on chemistry of cookery, bacteriology. 
Throughout the year dietaries and nutrition will be kept constantly in mind, the 
object being as much, or more, to study the scientific principles of foods as to pre- 
pare palatable viands. 
Dressmaking.—The course in dressmaking is devoted to the principles of drafting a 
basque and sleeves from actual measurements; cutting, fitting, and finishing a basque; _ 
cutting and making a skirt; choice of material, price, quantity and amount needed; 
cutting of fancy fronts to basques; pupils are required to plan an entire dress with 
written description of it before beginning, including collar, trimming sleeves, ete. ; 
making of dress. 
In connection with the dressmaking the cultivation of taste will be studied. ‘The 
proportion of the human figure. Dress as appropriate to individuals; sketches for 
dresses made in pencil and color. Harmony of color in fabrics,

With the foregoing special attention to bearings of dress on health; how to dress 
to preserve health and strength; rational dress reform studied; presentation of 
physiology of dress by special lectures. 
During the year three gowns and a house jacket or waist will be required from 
each pupil. 
SLOYD SCHOOL, 
The urgent need of educational manual training in connection with the work 
ordinarily done in public schools inspired the establishment of a sloyd department 
in the institute. Pupils will be admitted to this department who have completed the 
usual third year of the public school. The work, as arranged for this department, 
consists of two lines: (1) The ordinary bookwork and (2) that of sloyd proper. 
The sloyd department consists of (1) teachers’ training classes; (2) students’ 
elasses; (3) children’s classes. 
‘Admission vo the teachers’ training classes can be gained only by persons who are 
graduates of high schools, normal schools, or colleges, or by persons passing the 
special examinations required. 
‘The studies and manual work in this course are classified as follows: 
Manual work.—Mechanical drawing; completion of 36 sloyd models; the comple- 
tion of 12 wood-turning models; sharpening and care of tools. 
Theoretical work.—The psychology of sloyd; pedagogy of sloyd; history of sloyd; 
mechanics of sloyd; study of materials, botanical structure and properties of 
wood, etc. 
Sloyd and drawing are correlated. They are in fact inseparable, for there is an 
inner organic connection between those subjects. 
As no methodical work in material, especially wood, can be done except after the 
performance of some outline drawing, the drawing must precede the woodwork; 
and one of our capital aims is to combine manual instruction organically with draw- 
ing instruction, for without this organic connection the sloyd, as well as any other 
form of manual training, will not effect mind training. 
‘The course in drawing includes the following subjects: (1) Geometrical construc- 
tions; (2) principles of representation; (3) representation in reduced size by the use 
of scales; (4) projections, orthographic and isometric; (5) inking and tracing; (6) 
perspective, linear; (7) blue printing. 
The drawing involves not only inventional and descriptive geometry, byt also an 
appropriate amount of free-hand drawing, and teachers who complete the sloyd 
course will also be able and prepared to teach what is termed industrial drawing. 
The students’ classes, distinguished from the children’s classes by the advanced 
work and the age of pupils, are formed for young boys and girls, who take up this 
branch of study with a view to obtain that broad and important culture which 
comes from the education of the eye and hand in connection with the training of 
the mind. 
Admission to these classes may be gained by boys und girls of 14 years of age. 
The course for these classes consists of the making of 24 sloyd models; the making 
of 15 wood-turning models; mechanical and free-hand drawing. 
The aim and end of the instruction in these classes is not chiefly to prepare for 
any other specific department of the institution, but to cooperate to the mutual and 
general end the harmonious development of mind and body. 
The drawing in these classes is a complete course in industrial drawing per se, 
inasmuch as special importance will be given it, and that it involves, in addition to 
free-hand drawing, such intellectual problems as will make it not merely an eye-and- 
hand training, but ideally a mind education. 
The students will receive one lesson a day of an hour and a half, and the course 
will extend through the entire school year. The wood turning will begin at some 
suitable time in the second term of the year. Carving as well as wood turning are 
introduced for the sake of broadening and cultivating the esthetic ideas of the stu- 
dents, and also because this refreshing extension of the work has been found to gain 
for the students a large fund of distinct ideas from which they otherwise would be 
cut off. 
The children’s classes are by far the most important functions of/the sloyd depart- 
ment. The course begins with elementary work. The first year’s course is charac- 
terized by the geometric motives in the outlines of the objects. It proceeds from 
the simple, straight, oblique, and round forms, and advances step by step to higher 
and more complicated forms. No abstract, meaningless exercises are performed, but 
each exercise results in some finished article, as labels, key tags, table mats, vase 
stands, cutting boards, keyboards, triangles, pencil sharpeners, shelves, brackets, 
picture frames, ete. These are methodically arranged in a progressive order, which 
is followed, so that each child receives a successive training of the thinking powers 
in connection with the training of the physical powers. 
The drawing, free-hand and constructive, is a conspicuous part of the work in
-P-A-G-E-107
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. | 1065 
these classes, and precedes the woodwork. This course, including both woodwork 
and drawing, leads up to and through the advanced course taken up by the students’ 
classes. 
In this connection it may be ‘profitable to present an analysis of the exercises 
embodied in the models, and also an analysis showing the interwoven application 
and recurrence of some exercises. The analysis illustrates the well-regulated repeti- 
tion of the exercises, and that this repetition is performed under varied circumstances 
and on advanced work. 
Each model represents a certain number of exercises. The models thus are the 
expressions of said set of exercises, and from the analysis is found that each model 
with its set of exercises is but a sequence of the preceding ones. It further shows 
the fact that every model exists only for the purpose of introducing new cognitions, 
new tools, new exercises in drawing and wordwook, in an organic, progressive 
growth, keeping pace with the growth of mind and body of the student. 
EQUIPMENT FOR MANUAL TRAINING. 
Most of the shops and laboratories of the manual training department are located 
in the Polytechnic Hall, which is a two-story brick structure with a frontage of 140 
feet on Fair Oaks-avenue and 80 feet on Chestnut street. 
The wood shop, which is located on the second floor, has been provided with 20 work- 
benches, at each of which 4 students can work daily. Every bench is provided with 
a drawer for each student who has occasion to use it, in which, under Yale lock, are 
placed the planes, chisels, and turning tools used by the student to whom that 
drawer is assigned. These tools are left to his care; for to sharpen and keep tools 
in proper condition for use involves probably as much skill as does their actual use. 
Accordingly, no two students are permitted to handle the same edged tools. 
Each bench has a set of tools which are used in common by four students during 
the day, and comprise the following: One try-square, 1 T bevel square, 1 foot square, 
1marking gauge, 1 pair of inside calipers, 1 pair of outside calipers, 1 pair of com- 
passes, 1 block plane, 1 hammer, 1 mallet, 1 oil can, 1 oil stone, 1 backsaw, 1 hand- 
saw, 1 rip-saw, 1 screw-driver, and 1 6-inch Coe’s wrench. At the student’s right 
hand on the bench is a 14-inch lathe while at the opposite end of the bench is 
placed his bench-stop and lightning-grip wood-worker’s vise. The shop is supplied 
with a large band saw for cutting up stock, and also afine fret saw. Besides these, the 
following, which are less often used, are at his disposal when needed: One combined. 
rabbet, beading, and slitting plane, 1 plow plane, braces and bits, cabinet scrapers 
and files, carving chisels and veniers, He is thus equipped with all the appliances 
and tools necessary to do thorough work in joinery, turning, inlaying, and scroll 
sawing. A special pattern-maker’s lathe and well-equipped bench are provided for 
the use of the instructor. : 
The forging room, situated on the first floor in the east wing of the Polytechnic 
Hall, is equipped for 23 pupils. 
The furnishing consists of 5 nests of Buffalo quadruple forges and 3 single forges. 
Each forge has a telescopic hood. The fires are urged by a No. 9 pressure blower, 
and the room is kept reasonably free from smoke by a 60-inch exhaust fan. 
The anvils are furnished with all necessary tools, such as hammers, hardies, swages, 
fullers, flatters, tongs, and squares. In addition to these tools for individual use, 
special sets of sledges, heading tools, set hammers, hot and cold cutting chisels, 
punches, calipers, taps and dies, drills, etc., are provided for general use. A hand 
blower, double emery grinder, combined hand and power drill, and 4 blacksmith 
vises complete the furnishing of the room. 
The equipment in the pattern shop is similar to that of the wood shop, but more 
extensive. In addition, it is provided with a well-equipped molding bench, where 
the students may test their patterns and gain some knowledge of the principles of 
molding. The adjoining lumber room contains a band saw and a scroli saw. 
‘The machines in the machine shop, including a 55-horsepower engine, are of the 
latest style, haying all the modern improvements. 
The shop contains the following machines: A 24-inch by 6-foot ‘‘ Powell” planer; 
a “Hendy” shaper, 15-inch stroke; a 24-inch ‘Prentiss Bros.” drill; a Sigourney 
sensitive drill; ‘Brown & Sharp’s” No.1 Universal milling machine, with over- 
hanging arm and universal milling head; a two-wheel emery grinder; a grindstone; 
a24-inch by 10-foot ‘‘Reed” lathe, with compound rest; a 16-inch by 8-foot ‘‘ Reed” 
lathe; four 14-inch by 6-foot “ Reed” lathes, one of which has a taper attachment; 
two 14-inch by 6-foot “ Prentiss Bros.” lathes; a 14-inch by 6-feot ‘‘ Putnam & Sons’” 
lathe; a 14-inch by 6-foot ‘‘ Hendey-Norton” lathe, which has the latest improvements 
for screw cutting, also a compound rest, and two 12-inch by 4-foot speed lathes. 
It contains a bench provided with six machinists’ vises. In the tool room is an 
8-inch by 32-inch Mosely & Company bench lathe. 
The following is a partial list of tools in the tool room: One 24-inch, one 16-inch,

and three 12-inch four-jawed independent chucks; three 12-inch, two 9-inch, and ono 
6-inch three-jawed universal chucks; cutters, and mills, and attachments for tho mill- 
ing machine; a set of twist drills, front one-fourth inch to-1} inches by thirty sec- 
onds; from 1} to 2 inches by sixteenths, a set of hand reamers from one-fourth inch 
to 1} inches by thirty-seconds; aset of ‘‘ Rose” reamers one-fourth inch to 1} inches 
by sixteenths; a set of taps and dies from seven-sixty-fourths to one-fourth inch by 
sixty-fourths and taps from one-fourth to 1 inch by sixteenths; a full set of dogs and 
two sets of arbors. Revolying frame contains calipers, squares, ete. Other tools are 
in the drawers and hung about the room. 
The check system is used in giving out tools and the’ students in turn caring for 
the tool room. 
The sewing and garment-making room is located on the first floor. It has been 
equipped with 4 large tables, furnished with a sufficient number of drawers to accom- 
modate 3 classes of 16 members each in garment making. Seven Standard sewing 
machines, a patent gas iron heater, pressing boards, together with necessary needles, 
scissors, thimbles, scales, tapelines, etc., for the use of individual students, consti- 
tute the equipment of this department. Adjoining the main sewing room a retiring 
room for fitting purposes is provided. 
The cooking room is located on the second floor, and is supplied with tables, upon 
which are gas stoves. Along either side of each table are the drawers, containing 
the caps, aprons, sleeve protectors, notebooks, etc., of the two young ladies assigned 
to work at that.side of the table. A drawer contains cooking utensils, mixing and 
measuring dishes, stirring spoons, kitchen knives and forks, ete., while in the ‘cup- 
board beneath is a full assortment of stove and kitchen furnishings. At cither end 
of the table towels, lid lifters, etc., are hung. Two girls work at cach stove, each 
~ stndent participating in every process called for in the instruction. A large dust- 
proof cupboard, containing meal and flour bins, dish closets, etc., a large water 
heater and Lowe patent gas range, and a large refrigerator and cupboard for furnish- 
ings are also provided, 
Tho sloyd department, located in the basement of the cast hall, is equipped with 
20 sloyd working benches, cach of which is provided with a set of high-grade cab- 
inetmaker’s tools; charts, models, blackboards, and cases divided in compartments, 
avuere students keep their work, material, drawing instruments, etc., are also pro- 
vided. 
The work in clay modeling is carried on in a light, well-ventilated room on the 
main floor of east hall. The department is equipped.with a fine selection of casts, 
of ornament, 118 having been added this year, It is also furnished with a complete 
set of anatomical charts, besides the usual lockers, stands, ete., for clay work. 
The department of wood carving occupies two rooms in east hall, one of which 
is fitted with worktables, lockers with tools for students’ use. and cases for exhibi- 
tionof work. The instructor's private room adjoins this, and is used for special lines 
of advanced work. These rooms are fitted with a good selection of casts and charts, 
showing the various styles of historic ornament. 
  CuicaGe (ILL.) ManuaL Trainrna SCHOOL. 
[Statement of I. H. Belfield, director.] 
This school, the first independent manual training school in the United States, is 
now in its thirteenth year. While its peculiar feature is manual training, it also 
furnishes thorough instruction in the essential studies of a high-school course, thus 
fitting its graduates for immediate entrance into active life, or for admission to 
higher institutions of learning. 
‘The central idea in our instruction is educational. It is true, however, that the 
manual work has an industrial value, and that many of our pupils enter the school 
in order to fit themselves to earn a living, notwithstanding that we have, on every 
proper occasion, distinctly stated that the school does not teach a trade or trades, 
About 50 per cent of our graduates (and many pupils who do not graduate) enter 
upon life without further school instruction, many finding remunerative employment 
as draftsmen, designers, machinists’ apprentices, and in other callings in which 
manual skill is necessary. . About 50 per cent of our graduates continue their studies 
‘in higher schools, principally technological. 
Our manual training work is obligatory upon all pupils. 
This school is not connected with the public school system of the city or State, 
and does not receive funds from cither. It is under the control of a board of nine 
trustees, who are elected by the Chicago Manual Training School Association, which 
association is composed exclusively of members of the Commercial Club of Chicago. 
The board of trustees is organized under a general law of the State. Our means of 
support are principally two: First, tuition, which averages $100 a year; second, 
incomo from an endowment of $50,000, a bequest to the school by the late Mr. John 
Crerar, a member of the Commercial Club and of the board of trustees until his 
death,
-P-A-G-E-109
    
1067 
The average age of pupils entering is about 15 years of age; the average age of 
those graduating i is about 18 years. MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
We aim to adopt the most approved methods of instruction, including laboratories ~ 
for physics and chemistry. Drawings are made from models, casts, machinery, ete. 
The shop work passes from exercises to constructive work as soon as possible; tho 
interest of pupils being better sustained in this way than by mere exercises. Among 
the latest material products of the school are a large gap lathe (1,500 pounds 
weight) and a tower clock with Westminster chime of steel bars. 
however, is subordinate to education. 
The cost of the plant is about $125,000. Tho expense of maintenance about 
$25,000 a year. 
We believe that manual training has its effeet upon other studies, both directly 
and indirectly. For instance, the drawing and shopwork assist to a better under- 
standing of geometry, physics, and chemistry. They assist also, we believe, in the 
development of clearer habits of thinking, and contribute to the development ef the 
judgment and will power to an extent not reached by the study of mere books. We 
have found that the influence of manual training is to retain pupils in school longer 
than they would otherwise stay. 
‘The experience of more than twelve years confirms my belief that manual training 
is an important part of education; thatit hasa purely pedagogic value. An exami- 
nation of the curriculum of this school will show that it makes as great demands 
upon its pupils as does the usual high-school course, in academic work, in addition 
to shopwork and drawing. That this academic work is as well done as similar work 
is done in nonmanual training schools can be proved by the testimony of college 
officers. It is true, however, “that the daily school hours of this school aro about 
ninety minutes longer than ‘the usual high-school hours; and it is believed that 
manual training school pupils devote more > time to their school duties than do pupils 
in nonmanual tre aining high schools.

MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1069 
MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOL OF WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, ST. Louis, Mo. 
[Statement of C. M. Woodward, director.] 
The St. Louis Manual Training School is a subdepartment of Washington Uni- 
versity. Besides the usual college or literary department, the university contains 
six professional schools, all of high grade. There are three subdepartments: An 
academy for girls, a classical school for boys, and the manual training school. 
The manual training school is a secondary or preparatory school between the dis- 
trict or grammar school on the one hand and the high-grade engineering school on 
the other. It was organized to effect several ends: 
(1) To furnish # broader and more appropriate foundation for higher technical 
education. 
(2) To serve as a developing school where pupils could discover their inborn 
capacities and aptitudes, whether in the direction of literature, science, engineering, 
or the practical arts, while securing a liberal elementary training. 
(3) To furnish to those who looked forward to industrial life opportunity to become 
familiar with tools, materiais, drafting, and the methods of construction, as well as 
with ordinary English branches. , 
‘The central idea is intellectual growth and development—the more healthy such 
growth and the more complete such development the better is the student prepared 
for whatever he may undertake after leaving the school. This is especially obvious 
if he enter upon higher technical study, or if he enter industrial life. Oflate I have 
noticed that many graduates of several years’ standing have taken up the study of 
law and medicine. This result has been somewhat of a surprise. 
No student is allowed to enter the manual training school except upon the under- 
standing that he takes all the manual training (shopwork and drawing) in regular 
order, and that last catalogue states that ‘‘ Under no circumstances will a student bo 
permitted to enter upon the shopwork of a higher grade while he is deficient in the 
academic work of the lower.” 
The St. Louis Manual Training School has an invested endowment of about 
$115,000, the income of which enables the school to offer annually between fifty and 
sixty free scholarships. The full tuition fees for the three years are as follows: $75, 
$100, $120. 
The ayerage age of pupils entering the school is about 15 years. I do not regard 
any of our work as unique unless it is this: The instruction in tool work is systematic 
and regular; our teachers do not hesitate to teach the best methods and the proper 
appliances in manual training any more than they do the best methods and proper 
appliances in drawing, physics, Latin, algebra, history, and English composition. I 
have noticed in many schools a disposition on the part of the shop teachers to 
encourage pupils to find out for themselves what tools to use and how to use them. 
I regard the practice as unscientific, unphilosophical, and wasteful in the extreme. 
This unscientific style of conducting manual training is sometimes defended on the 
ground that it is desirable to encourage originality and free development.. I do not 
find that careful teaching destroys opportunity for such desirable results. On the 
contrary, I find that judicious instruction stimulates and expands the intellectual 
powers far more than the inevitable failures and waste of time which result from 
attempts to rediscover and reconstruct all the principles and appliances for manual 
work. 
The course of instruction covers three years, and embraces five parallel lines, as 
follows: 
First. A course of pure mathematics, including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and 
some trigonometry. 
Second. A course in science and applied mathematics, including zoology, botany, 
chemistry, physics, and mensuration. ' 
Third. A course in language and literature, including English grammar, spelling, 
rhetoric, composition, literature, history, and the elements of civic and political econ- 
omy. Latin, French, and German are introduced as electives with a part of the 
English and science. 
Fourth. A course in free-hand and instrumental drawing. 
Fifth. A course of tool instruction, including joinery, wood carving, wood turning, 
molding, pattern making, brazing, soldering, forging, and bench and machine work 
in metals. 
During the second and third years of the course an average of two hours per week 
is devoted to systematic instruction and practice in military drill.

will take the place of civics and political economy. Students are expected to master 
the details of grammar and be able to read easy prose at sight. 
Detaits or SHop INSTRUCTION. 
Shep instruction is given similarly to laboratory lectures. The instructor at the 
bench, machine, or anvil fully expiains the principles to be used or illustrated, and 
in all elementary work he executes in the presence of the whole class the day’s les- 
sons, giving all needed information, using drawings and the blackboard freely. 
After every step has been explained the class proceeds to tho execution of the task, 
leaving the instructor to give additional help to such as need it. At a specified time 
the lesson ceases and the work is brought in, commented on, and marked. It is not 
always necessary that the work assigned should be finished; the essential thing is 
that it should be well begun and carried on with reasonable speed and accuracy. 
Precision and system are taught at every step. The particular shapes are given 
with the intent to familiarize the pupil with the customary styles and methods of 
construction, to teach the meaning and fitness of common tools, and the exact force 
of names and descriptive words. 
During the first half year previous to the execution of a lesson in wood each pupil 
is required to make a working drawing of the same, inserting all necessary dimen- 
sions in figures, é 
By the end of a half year the pupil has become so familiar with the execution of 
shop drawings, and so expert in their use, that it is no longer of educational value 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
1072 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
for him to make the drawings from which he works; accordingly he is then furnished 
with blue prints. 
With the introduction of each tool the pupils are taught how to keep the same in 
order. They are taught that good tools are absolutely necessary to good work. 
The taste of the pupils is cultivated by the introduction of forms of grace and the 
practice of design. | 
A series of lessons is given in wood carving. The lessons are purely elementary, 
and calculated rather to suggest elaborate and delicate forms than to give oppor- 
tunity for their production. 
The object of the forging shop is to enable every pupil in the school to master the 
fundamental principles of forging iron and steel. This work is, in one essential 
feature, different from any other kind. Wood or cold iron will wait any desired 
length of time while the pupil considers what he is to do and how he is to do it; but 
here comes in temperature, subject to continual change. The injunction is impera- 
tive to “strike while the iron is hot,” and hence quick work is demanded—a hard 
thing for new hands. To obviate this difficulty bars of lead are first used, with 
which the lesson is executed, while all the particulars of form and the methods of 
holding and striking are studied. The lead acts under the hammer very much like 
hot iron, and permits every operation on the anvil except welding. After the lead 
come iron and steel. 
The various operations of drawing, bending, upsetting, punching, welding, and 
tempering are learned in connection with simple exercises, which generally have no 
end other than the progress of the student. Occasionally such pieces as hooks, 
stirrups, chains, tongs, hammers, etc., are made for use in the shop. 
The final exercises consist of the construction of a set of tempered steel tools, 
which the pupil will himself use in the machine shop during his third year. 
Forging ‘‘projects” are generally in the form of ornamental wrought-iron work. 
These ‘ projects” are designed and executed entirely by the pupils. The interest 
they take in them may be inferred from the care and skill their pieces show. 
The course in pattern making and molding, with some exercises in soldering, 
occupies ten weeks; i. e., less than eighty hours. 
Castings are made of plaster or lead. Though comparatively little molding or 
casting is done, enough practice is given to illustrate the principles, to test the 
accuracy of molds, and explain the use of technical terms. In some instances 
ornamental or art forms are molded and cast. : 
In the machine shop it is obviously out of the question to furnish a class of 20 
pupils with a lathe, planer, drill, etc., each. The cost of such tools puts the matter 
beyond discussion. Hence, it is not possible to have all the pupils in a class of 24 
performing the same exercise at the same time, as is the ease in all the shops just 
described. Nevertheless, this fact does not interfere with the use of systematic 
lessons and uniform practice. By exercises suited to the uses of each machine, and 
So bench work, and by regular rotation of the class, each pupil does the same work. 
The verbal instruction and illustration at the machine for any lesson is given to the 
whole division at once, though several days may intervene between the giving of 
the instruction and the pupil’s performance. Thus it is practicable to secure, in a 
large degree, the benefits of the class system. 
‘This course includes work at the (a) bench: Use of hammer and chisel, file, scraper, 
hand dies, taps, and reamers. (b) Hand lathe: Use of hand tools, drilling, counter- 
sinking, filing, and polishing. (c) Engine lathe: Turning, boring, with bar and lathe 
tool, screw cutting, external and internal chucking and machine fitting. (d) Drill 
press: Drilling and boring. . (e) Planer and shaper: Producing flat or curved sur- 
faces and fittings. (jf) Care of tool room; the preparation of shop drawings; study 
of the engine and boilers. (g) Construction of a machine, tool, or device invented 
or selected by the student. 
Opportunity for the mastery of these processes determines the nature of the prac- 
tice pieces. The cutting tools the pupil uses are those made, tempered, ground, and 
adjusted by himself. 
Each wood-working shop is upward of 40 feet square, and has uniform accommo- 
dations for a class of 25 or 26 pupils. 
Each pupil has one of the uniform sets of hand edge tools for his exclusive use, 
kept in alocked drawer. For the care and safety of those tools he is held responsible. 
The school has 51 speed lathes! for wood turning, 51 benches, 51 iron vises, 51 sets 
vf common tools, 51 sets of wood-carving tools, and 150 individual sets of edge tools 
in as many drawers. 
Each shop has 2 grindstones, which run continuously during shop hours. 
The molding and casting room contains 24 benches and sets of tools, flasks, etc., 
for molding. A small gas furnace is used for melting alloys and for heating the core 
oven. Separate benches and furnaces are provided for soldering.    
1 Pwo of these lathes are of iron made for the school by the class of 1888, and one by a member of the class of 1889.
-P-A-G-E-115
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1073 
In this shop is the Land saw, which is used for cutting lumber into sizes suited to 
class exercises. 
The first floor of the shop wing is devoted to metal work, and comprises the 
machine shop and the forging shop. The forging shop is 40 feet square, and has its 
complete equipment of 25 forges, anvils, tubs, and sets of ordinary hand tools. The 
blast is supplied by a power blower, and a large exhaust fan keeps the shop reason- 
ably free from smoke and gas, even when all the forges are in use. Brazing is 
taught in this shop after general forging. 
The machine shop is 40 by 50 feet. It possesses an equipment of 16 engine screw- 
cutting lathes, 6 speed lathes,! 2 planers, 2 drills, a shaper of 15 inches stroke, a 
large and a small emery grinder, a gas forge,? an anvil and tools, and a tool room. 
Ten vises and benches afford opportunity for bench work. The shop is furnished for 
a class of 24 pupils at once. 
The engine room is below this shop. The engine is capable of about 40-horse- 
power. It has a 12-inch cylinder and 12-inch stroke, and runs at the rate ef 200 revo- 
lutions per minute. The steam-generating apparatus of the university consists of a 
battery of three large stee] boilers, set and furnished in the most approved manner. 
These boilers furnish heat for the entire group of university buildings, as well as 
steam for the engine in the shop. The equipment of steam power furnishes to pupils 
of the third-year class the means of becoming familiar with machinery on a practical 
scale. 
The plans of our building are not given, inasmuch as I do not regard our present 
quarters as models tor other schools to copy. Elsewhere (see the paper I recently 
contributed to the Bureau on the “Rise and progress of manual training”) I have 
discussed plans and given illustrations of some of the best. 
I have given estimates of the cost of tools and shop furniture in the two books 
which I have written (see the Manual Training School: Its Aims, Methods, and 
Results, D. C. Heath & Co.; also Manual Training, Scribner & Co.). I have also 
discussed the question of cost and annual expenses in the article already referred to 
contributed to the Bureau of Education. 
I do not hesitate to say that all experience justifies the claim originally made for 
manual training that it (a) stimulates an interest in other studies; (b) it arouses the 
ambition of boys who have poor memory for literary and historical studies, but who 
are strong in executive matters; (c) that it lengthens the school life for many boys, 
not only extending it through the manual-training school, but carrying it into higher 
education to a very unexpected degree; (d) the moral influence is very great (this 
point I have discussed quite fully in the two books referred to); (¢) for the ocenpa- 
tions of the graduates of the St. Louis Manual Training School, I refer to the record 
of the alumni in the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1894-95. The 
high, manly character of our alumni is so fully recognized in this community that 
the board of directors of Washington University have recently authorized the 
alumni association to elect annually from their number one of the members of the 
board of control of the school.    
HEBREW TECHNICAL InsTITUTE, NEW York, N. Y. 
[Statement of Edgar S. Barney, principal.] 
The Hebrew Technical Institute is an institution having a three-years’ course for 
Hebrew boys between 12} and 16 years of age. The ‘‘central idea” is to give its 
pupils a general education in the mechanic arts combined with a good English 
education. 
During the last year special attention is given to one of four courses, depending 
upon the aptitude of the pupils—woodwork, metal work, electrical work, and 
mechanical drawing. 
It is not a preparatory school for higher institutions, but educates boys for actual 
mechanical work. 
Manual training is obligatory, about one-third of the time being devoted to it. 
The institute was organized in 1883 and has no connection with the public schools 
or any other institution. 
It is supported by the members and patrons of the society, the members paying 
$10 per year and the patrons $25 per year. 
Woodwork and drawing are taught throughout the course. Metal work is intro- 
duced in the second year. Laboratory work in physics is taught during the first and 
second years, leading to electricity in the third year. 
We are about to erect new buildings and our plans are not yet completed. 
1'Tywo of these lathes were made for the school by the class of 1887. ‘The gas forge is furnished with an air jet from a tank kept filled by an oscillating cylinder air ump made by certain members of the class of 1888. A new air pump is in the course of construc- ion by members of the class of 1896. *

MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1075 
Tus TECHNICAL SCHOOL or CINCINNATI, OHIO. 
[Statement of J. B. Stanwood, director.] 
As stated in the articles of incorporation, the object of this school is to furnish 
pupils instruction and practice in the use of tools, mechanical and free-hand draw- 
ing, mathematics, English language, and the natural sciences; to develop skill in 
handicraft, and to impart such a knowledge of essential mechanical principles as 
will facilitate their progress in the acquirement of manual trades. 
Our work is principally educational. When our pupils leave they are prepared 
_to either enter business or to take a course in some higher college. Manual training 
is obligatory on all pupils. 
We have no connection with the public schools, and the school gets its support 
from the tuition of pupils and from private subscription of citizens. The tuition 
is as follows: For the high-scheol department: First-year class, per term, $37.50; 
per year, $75; second-year class, per term, $50; per year, $100; third-year class, per 
term, $62.50; per year, $125. Intermediate department: Per term, $25; per year, $50. 
Pupils furnish their own books, drawing instruments, and materials, scales, rules, 
calipers, oilstones, ete., and their own aprons and overalls. The school furnishes 
all shop tools and materials. 
Drawing instruments and materials cost from $10 to $12 for the first year and from 
$2 to $3 thereafter. 
A laboratory fee of not more than $2 per year is required of each pupil. This is 
paid to the teacher in assessments as needed. 
Our pupils generally enter the intermediate department at about 12 years of age 
or the high-school department at about 14. Our graduates are generally about 16 
to 18 years of age. 
The cost of the plant is $13,286.66. Tho annual cost of maintaining is about $300, 
not including teachers’ salaries. 
We find manual training very helpful to our school. Our pupils, having taken a 
three years’ course, enter college one year in advance of the city high-school pupils, 
whose courso is four years,

SHOP INSTRUCTION IN THE IiIGH-SCHOOL DEPARTMENT, 
Carpenter shop for first-year pupils.—T wo series of construction exercises constitute 
the general work of the carpenter shop. Tho first series is made at the bench, the 
second at the turning Jathe. These exercises are so arranged as to bring into use 
different tools, to familiarize the pupils with the forms of construction, to develop a  
-P-A-G-E-118
& 1076 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
reasonable amount of skill, to bring into action the muscles of the arms, trunk, and 
legs, to develop judgment, and to train the mind to get control of and maintain 
supremacy over the body. 
Heretofore, with few exceptions, these exercises have had no intrinsic value. Many 
of them are now so designed as to be, when completed, either useful or beautiful, 
and at the end of the year the articles may become the pupil’s property. We find 
that pupils show greater interest and care if their finished produc n be put to 
use or kept as souvenirs. In addition to this series of exercises, which each boy 
completes, there is carried on some larger or more important work, upon which groups 
of boys are employed. 
Blacksmith shop for second-year pupils. —The course in the blacksmith shop consists 
of a series of exercises in iron and steel. This embodies the most important princi- 
ples of welding iron, welding iron and steel, tempering, hardening, and annealing 
steel, and the construction of tools. It is in this work that pupils learn to “strike 
while the iron is hot,” and to know what it is ‘to have many irons in the fire;” all 
of which develop quick judgment. 
The articles comprising the series of exercises and the order in which they are 
made are as follows: 1, paper weight; 2, cold chisel; 3, center punch; 4, picture frame; 
5, plain weld; 6, ring for a flower stand; 7, butcher knife; 8, L weld; 9, bracket; 
10, forging hammer; 11, tongs; 12, wrench; 13, wood chisel; 14, pick; 15, easel; 16, 
flower stand. 
In addition to these exercises special work is done, consisting of ornamental pieces 
of hammered iron, for which original designs are drawn by the pupils in the drafting 
room. ‘This gives practical training in designing and construction. 
Only the simplest measuring instruments are used, the idea being to train the eye 
to estimate dimensions. 
Machine shop for third-year pupils.—The methods of instruction in a machine shop 
must be different from those in a shop where all pupils work simultaneously at the 
bench or forge; for with a variety of machines there must be a variety of work. As 
all pupils of a class must be at work at the same time, some are put at lathes, others 
at planers, others at vises, etc. 
It is, consequently, impossible to instruct by means of a systematic series of exer- 
cises, but we have found that excellent results can be effected by constructing some 
one machine. In building a machine, the special treatment that each detail requires 
and the knowledge of machine anatomy that is obtained gives a variety and breadth 
of experience that a series of exercises does not. 
In the machine shop of the technical school attention has been given chiefly to the 
construction of the steam engine, the great tool of modern times. Three have been 
built in the past four years; the first was a simple slide-valve engine of 10 horse- 
power; the next, a noncondensing compound engine of 15 horsepower, is now driving 
all the machinery of the school; the last, a triple-expansion engine of about 30 horse- 
power, was put in place last year.. The pupils prepared the working drawings for 
all of these engines. It is the purpose of the school to construct from time to time 
engines of different types, thereby creating an interesting and valuable collection. 
Fifteen turning lathes for the carpenter shop have been constructed. 
The equipment of the workshops is as follows:     
    EQUIPMENT. 
Carpenter shop.—Fifty-two cabinetmaker’s benches; 30 speed lathes, 15 of which 
have been made by the pupils; 1 rip and cross-cut circular saw; 1 grindstone; 2 
emery wheels; bench tools for 100 boys; turning tools for 50 boys. 
Blacksmith shop.—Thirty forges; 30 anvils; 2 vises; 1 blower; 1 exhaust fan; 1 bel- 
lows; 1 grindstone; 1 drill press; 2 workbenches, with the necessary tools; tongs, 
hammers, flatters, fullers, and swages, etc., for 90 boys. 
Machine shop.—One engine lathe, 20-inch swing, 10-foot bed; 1 engine lathe, 17-inch 
swing, 8 foot bed; 5 engine lathes, 14-inch swing, 5-foot bed; 1 Brown & Sharpe 
speed lathe; 1 Brainard milling machine; 1 Cincinnati Milling Machine Company

Washburn twist drill grinder; 152-foot bench, with 10 vises; lathe and vise tools for 
24 boys; also necessary chucks, boring bars, taps, dies, and reamers necessary for 
same. The power is derived from a5 by 8 by 12 inch compound steam engine, built 
by the pupils of the class of 1891, taking steam from two tubular boilers in the base- 
ment. There are also 2 other steam engines built by the pubils,

III.—TRADE SCHOOLS. 
CaLIFoRNIA SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL Arts, SAN FRANCISCO, CAL. 
[From the catalogue of 1896-97.] 
The California School of Mechanical Arts is the outcome of the public spirit of 
James Lick, a citizen of California. Having been brought up in narrow cireum- 
stances, earning his living in early manhood as a mechanic, he sympathized with the 
struggles of the young for a place in life, and resolved to found a school where those 
who were dependent upon themselves could receive such an education as would give 
them a foothold in the world. 
On September 21, 1875, Mr. Lick executed a deed of trust, by which he conveyed 
to certain trustees a large amount of property for various purposes of public benefit, 
of which this school was one. 
The execution of this particular portion of the trust was delayed by prolonged 
litigation, and it was not until January 3, 1895, that the buildings were completed 
and the school formally established. 
On Monday, January 14, 1895, instruction was commenced. 
PLAN OF INSTRUCTION. 
A complete course covers.a period of four years, of which the first half is devoted 
toa mania course and the last two years to a formal apprenticeship in some 
one department. 
The prime object of the school is to teach trades. It aims to give each student a 
thorough knowledge of the technique of some one industrial pursuit from which he 
may earn his living. It offers, however, something more than the mere equivalent 
of a workshop apprenticeship. 
(1) Before commencing work exclusively at his trade each student must first com- 
plete a graded course of woodwork and ironwork, involving the elements of carpen- 
try, pattern making, forging, molding, and iron fitting, and covering the first two 
years of attendance, . 
(2) A systematic course of instruction in English, mathematics, science, and draw- 
ing precedes and parallels the purely apprenticeship instruction of the last two years. 
By means of these lines of preliminary instruction the student’s acquaintance with 
tools and materials and with science and art is made broad enough to allow the 
fullest expansion in any trade that he may select, and to permit of his ready adjust- 
ment to the new and varying conditions that are constantly taking place in all 
the mechanical and industrial arts. 
(3) There is the additional advantage that the shop instruction throughout is 
based upon work that is selected, as far as possible, for the benefit of the student, 
and not for the profit of his employer. This does not imply that his time of labor is 
frittered away, or that he is not made to realize the conditions he will have to face 
in after life. On the contrary, a large proportion of his time is devoted to the 
manufacture of marketable goods, and his success in the school is measured by his 
ultimate ability to execate his work in such a manner and at such a rate that the 
product of his labor, if placed upon the market, will stand the test of competition. 
The school has facilities for teaching the following trades and technical courses: 
(1) Carpentry, (2) pattern making, (3) forging, (4) molding, (5) machine-shop practice, 
(6) machine drawing, (7) archictectural drawing, (8) technical design, (9) modeling, 
(10) wood carving, (11) cookery, (12) dressmaking, (13) millinery, (14) preparatory 
for technical college course. 
PRELIMINARY COURSE. 
The two years’ preliminary course serves as a foundation for the different trades 
and technical courses. This part of the curriculum is essentially the same as the 
course given in the so-called manual training schools. It is different for boys and 
girls as regards tool work and domestic branches, but otherwise it is the same for all 
students, and is required of all. It divides its time equally between academic and 
industrial branches. 
The academic branches include English, mathematics, science, and history. One 
period of fifty minutes per day, for two years, is devoted to each of these subjects, 
with the exception of history, which is given on alternate days. 
The instruction in English includes word study, grammar, and rhetoric, practice 
in written and oral expression, and a study of literature through English classics. 
   
-P-A-G-E-120
  1078 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Tho mathematical instruction includes elementary algebra, and plane, solid, and 
spherical geometry, carried on side by side throughout both years. 
‘Fho science work consists of physics during the first year, and chemistry during 
the second year. 
The preliminary instruction includes, also, a general course of ancient, medi 
and modern history. 
The industrial branches arc made up of the three elements: Tool work, industrial 
art, and household art and science. 
Tho industrial art instruction begins the same for boys and girls. Free-hand 
representative and decorative drawing, mechanical drawing, modeling, and carving 
are substantially the same for both up to the middle of the second year, from which 
point of divergence the boys continue along the mechanical and architectural lines, 
while the girls do more of tho free-hand work, such as designing. 
Tho tool work (for boys only) consists of a graded course of carpentry, molding, 
and pattern making during the first year; forging, molding, and iron fitting dur- 
ing the second year; and during the first term of the third year machine-shop 
ractice. 
iE Tho work in household art and science begins in the first year with a course of 
plain sewing and the preliminary parts of cutting and fitting. Drafting and dress- 
making proper are completed during the first term of the second year. The rest of 
‘the second year is used for millinery. ‘The third-year work of this department com- 
prises cooking and a comprehensive course in the direct application of science and 
art in the household, including interior decorations and furnishings, heating, light- 
ing, ventilating, and other sanitary conditions, and hygiene.        
    2 
TRADES AND TECHNICAL COURSES, © 
At the beginning of the third year each student must elect one of the courses 
enumerated and must serve in it an apprenticeship of two years. 
All apprentices are required to meet one hour per week, either in a body or in sec- 
tions, for the purpose of discussing papers and reports to be submitted by individual 
members, somewhat after the seminary plan. The subjects of these reports are 
selected or assigned by the pupils themselves, as far as possible, and relate to manu- 
facturing processes and devices, to topics from the history of art and industry, and 
to scientific subjects. Each report must be exhaustive, and will be placed before 
tho class as clearly as possible by means of printed abstracts and the stereopticon, 
the presentation to be followed by a fhorongh discussion. 
Allapprentices are given a brief course in political economy, commercial geography, 
physical geography, and United States history and government. 
The mathematical instruction for apprentices is different for different courses, as 
indicated under each course. Nearly all apprentices take one or more of the follow- 
ing: (1) Heat calculations, including a general study of transformations of energy; 
(2) theoretical mechanics and elementary kinematics; (3) strength of materials, 
graphical determinations, construction of trusses and beams, and problems of tensile 
strength and elasticity; (4) bookkeeping and business forms; (5) logarithms, and 
the use of tables in general; (6) plane and spherical trigonometry; (7) those who 
elect technical course No, 14 are required to review the entire subjects of algebra, 
geometry, and trigonometry, and to add such parts as are required for admission to 
the universities. 
Science work for apprentices is selected from the following: (1) Tests upon the 
school boiler and engine; (2) metallurgy of iron; (3) experimental mechanics; (4) 
use of microscope; (5) phenomena of combustion; (6) physical and chemical proper- 
ties of foods; (7) adulterations; (8) sanitary chemistry; (9) chemistry of dyestuifs ; 
(10) physics, sound, and light. 
The following is an outline of the shopwork and other instruction for apprentices 
in each department: 
1. Carpentry.—Actual construction of cabinets, stairs, ctc., and of a large model of 
framo house, in all its details; specifications, contracts, and estimates; ventilation,

ities at the school for executing designs for oilcloths, fabrics, stained glass, wall 
paper, mural decorations, etc., bub this defect will be corrected, as far as possible, 
by frequent visits to factories and by inquiries among manufacturers. Since the 
school itself will have means for executing designs in wood, clay, terra cotta, and

EXPENSES. 
There is no charge for tuition, but students are required to furnish their own 
books, drawing instruments, overalls, aprons, and edge tools, and to pay the actual 
cost of working materials. The total expense averages about $20 a year. 
Working materials, such as lumber, iron, clay, chémicals, sewing materials, draw- 
ing materials, etc., are purchased in quantities for each department, and at the 
opening of each term payments are required in advance for the estimated cost of 
materials for the ensuing half-year. For the year 1896-97, this charge has been fixed 
at $5 aterm. 
Drawing instruments can be purchased from the school at cost, if desired. It is 
important that these instruments should be of good quality, and well selected. The 
sets handled by the school are sold at prices from $5 to $10. These are to be pur- 
chased at the beginning of the first year, and they last throughout the course. 
A set of chisels and plane-blades for carpentry and pattern making can be pur- 
chased from the school, if desired, at a cost of $2.50. They are required of all boys 
at the beginning of the first year. 
A set of carving tools is required during the second year. These may be purchased 
from the school at a cost of $3 per set of ten tools. 
Each boy entering the machine shop must provide himself with the followin, 
tools: 5-inch try-square; 8-inch outside calipers; 4-inch outside calipers; Ginck 
inside calipers; 6-inch dividers; 12-inch steel straightedge; three-fourths-pound 
hammer. ‘These are sold by the school for $5 per set. 
All other tools and appliances are furnished by the school, and loss or breakage, 
resulting from carelessness, is charged to the pupil responsible for such damage. 
Beginning with the year 1896-97, a new plan for furnishing overalls, aprons, and 
towels will be put into practice. For the sake of uniformity, and to avoid confu- 
sion, these garments must be of a prescribed pattern for each line of shop-work, 
must be washed at intervals to be designated by the instructor in charge, and each 
suit must be marked with the name of the owner.     
SPRINGFIELD (Mass.) INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTE. 
[Statement of L. P. Strong, director. ] 
Our several departments cover almost all lines of practical work, the central idea 
in the trade school being the trade. In the high school department is the manual 
training course for the first year and a half, at the completion of which, the stu- 
dent chooses a trade to which he devotes the remaining year and a half. 
Our engineering department, being a preparation to higher technical study, the 
practical work being compulsory even in this course. 
This is a private institution; our shops are thoroughly equipped to do business, 
and do work for outside firms which goes a long way toward our support. The 
amount charged for tuition varies from $50 for the trade school to $90 in the engi- 
neering department. 
The high school boys must be 15 years of age; the trade school boys must be at 
least 17 years of age and most of them are older. 
Our building is a four-story brick structure 160 feet long and 50 feet wide. The 
machine shop has 29 engine lathes, 1 planer, 3 drills, 1 shaper, 1 universal miller, 1 
tool grinder, emery wheels, hack saws, cutting off saws, etc., and a well stocked 
tool room in charge of a machinist where students can get any tools for their imme- 
diate use. 
Our carpenter shop equipment consists of 8 wood-turning lathes, 1 pattern-mak- 
ers’ lathe, 1 jig-saw, 1 pattern makers’ saw, and 1 jointer. We have a tool room 
here also where the extra tools are kept; each student has a drawer with lock and 
key containing the most common sizes of chisels, bits, planers, etc. 
The cost of the plant including equipment is about $50,000. 
Baron DE HirscH TRaDE SCHOOLS, New York City. 
[Statement furnished by J. Ernest G. Yalden, superintendent. ] 
This school, organized five years ago by the trustees of the Baron de Hirsch fund 
in order to assist Russian and Roumanian Jews to gain a knowledge of some trade, 
is as yet little known to the general public. * * * 
Its object is to render it possible for a young man to gain, during his stay at the 
school, a sufficient knowledge of the English language and the principles of some 
trade to enable him on leaving school to obtain work as a helper or ‘‘ junior” at that 
trade.

MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1081 
The trade school is not intended to turn out skilled mechanics, but to give a young 
man such a training in the principles of a trade and the proper ways of doing work 
that he is better fitted quickly to’ acquire, upon active practice at the trade, that 
necessary skill and quickness which is required of the tirst-class mechanic. * * * 
The school offers free course of instruction in six grades: Plumbing, carpentry, 
wood turning, machinist, house painting, and sign painting. 
Each course is five and one-half months in length, and the pupil is required to 
complete the same satisfactorily in order to obtain a certificate. 
A kit of tools is given to each graduate and efforts made to obtain work for them 
at the completion of their course. 
The first class to graduate was composed of 23 young men, distributed among the 
departments as follows: 5 carpenters, 8 machinists, 6 plumbers, and 4 sign painters. 
Eighty-seven per cent of these graduates came from Russia, the remainder from 
Roumania, and the average age was 19.1 years. Within three weeks after leaving 
the school 91 per cent were working at their chosen trade. * * * 
All exercises, whenever possible, are made directly from drawings and exactly to 
size. Shop methods are followed as closely as possible, and during the course 
frequent visits to large shops are made by the pupils,-under the guidance of an 
instructor, who points out the significance of the work viewed. 
The machine shop is 25 by 50 feet and accommodates about 20 pupils. It is 
equipped with 5 12-inch and 2 18-inch lathes or shapes, 2 drill presses, 2 planers, and 
all necessary hand tools, besides ample bench room for vise work. , 
The pupil is required to first complete some thirty exercises, in most part the com- 
pletion of some finished article, involving as far as possible all the fundamental 
principles of the machinist trade, i. e., bench work, drill press, planes, and lathe 
ractice. i 
E Toward the énd of the course the class is divided into squads and put at construc- 
tion work, such as the completion of a copy press or similar article. Lectures are 
given throughout this course on the tools, material, and operations of the trade. 
The carpentry and wood turning shop has a floor space of 1,25’ square feet and 
can accommodate 12 carpenters and 8turners. It is equipped with 10 turning lathes, 
circular saw, band saw, and all necessary benches for the carpenters. Each pupil 
first completes some twenty-four exercises, embracing the use of nearly all the car- 
penter’s tools and showing the fundamental operations of woodwork. 
These exercises include a complete set of joints, the application of mitering, dado- 
ing, rabbetting, chamfering, ete. The pupils then construct a number of articles, 
such as boxes, cupboards, arch centers, house trimmings, ete., and, finally, the class 
builds a small cottage complete from plans. i 
In the wood-turning course the pupil is taught the names. uses, and care of the 
turner’s tools; the use of the lathe, circular and band saws; finishing, staining, and 
polishing, and the construction of finished articles. 
The plumbing shop accommodates about 20 pupils and is equipped with 20 solder 
pots, benches, and all necessary tools of the trade. The course in plumbing and 
gas-fitting is very complete. Each pupil completes a set of exercises in lead work, 
such as joint wiping and sheet-lead work. The use of cast-iron pipe, wrought and 
galvanized iron pipe in plumbing work is fully explained, and each pupil has prac- 
tice in handling such material. 
In the house-painting course the pupil is taught plain painting, preparation of 
surface for painting, and how to remove old paint; kalsomining; painting in two 
and three shades; flatting, stippling, gilding, graining, etc.; paper hanging and the 
preparation of stencils. 
The sign-painting course includes the drawing, with chalk and triangle, the dif- 
ferent alphabets used by sign painters; preparation of colors and boards for paint- 
ing; lettering on wood and metal; glass sign painting in plain colors and gold; 
drawing of ornaments, scrolls, and borders, and the preparation of stencils. 
Instruction in drawing is given to the members of the machinist and carpentry 
departments, and consists of exercises in practical geometry; then the drawing of 
plans, elevations, and sections of various objects; and, finally, the making of simple 
working drawings from objects or written descriptions. 
This is decidedly a practical course, its object being to enable the graduate to 
read drawings and to work understandingly from them, though in nearly every 
anstance the pupil becomes skilled enough to make a very creditable working 
rawing. 
A course of instruction in English is offered to such pupils as are not familiar with 
the language, and also some instruction in arithmetic. 
Evening lectures are given at intervals throughout the course on general, scien- 
tific, and ethical subjects.

    1082 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
New York Trapy Scuoor, New Yorx City. 
[Statement of H. V. Brill, general manager.] 
Our school is exclusively a trade school, and instruction is given in trades only. 
By onr system of instruction we fit our graduates to carn their livelihood at tho 
trade they come to the school to learn. The manual training school does not have 
this particular purpose in view, the instruction in the handicrafts being supplemen- 
tary and an aid to literary work. 
The New York Trade School is an incorporated institution and has a charter from 
tho University of the State of New York. It is managed by a board of trustees and 
is not connected with the public schools or any other institution. Tho school is sup- 
ported by tuition fees from students and tho income from a permanent endowment 
fund. The rates of tuition vary from $12 to $16 for an evening course, and from $25 
to $40 for a day course. The charges for instruction include the use of tools and 
materials. < 
The school is restricted to young men between 17 and 23 years of age, and the 
instruction furnished is of the same practical character as will be met with in actual 
practice at the trade. A course of instruction is arranged for each trade for the 
student to follow. The course commences with simple work, and step by step 
advances on work more complicated. Skilled mechanics are employed as instructors, 
and the student receives individual instruction. The scientific principles which 
underlie the practical work is also taught by means of lectures, so that the student 
acquires not only manual skill but learns why work should be done ina certain way. 
The workrooms of the school are equipped the same as first-class workshops. The 
school furnishes ali tools and material. 3 
The value of the school plant is $275,000. The annual cost of maintenance is 
$30,000. ‘ 
The yearly attendance is 500. In the evening classes the members are residents of 
the city. Those who come to the day classes attend from all parts of the United 
States and Canada. 
       
  [From the catalogue for 1896-97.] 
Evening instruction is given in bricklaying, plastering, plumbing, electrical work, 
carpentry, houso painting, stonecutting, fresco painting, blacksmith’s work, print- 
ing, sign painting, and cornice work. 
There are day classes in plumbing, house and fresco painting, sign painting, brick- 
laying, carpentry, steam and hot-water fitting, and printiag. 
The evening classes are intended to give young men already in the trades an oppor- 
tunity to improve themselves, and to give young men who are earning their living 
at other occupations during the day a chance to learn a trade. 
Tho day classes, which are also open to beginners as well as to those who have some 
knowledge of the trade, graduate young men who are possessed of the skill of the 
average journeyman and have a wider knowledge of the trade in all its branches. 
The past few years much work of an advanced character has been introduced in 
the various day courses, and the constant practice gained by continuous application, 
such as the hours of the day classes afford, enables a pupil to rapidly acquire both 
skill and proficiency. 
Master Burtpers’ MECHANICAL TRADE SCHOOL, PHILADELPHIA, Pa, 
[Statement of William A. H. Allen, superintendent.] ae 
The school was established for the,instruction of boys desiring to enter the build- 
ing trades as apprentices, or those already engaged in those trades, but. whose term 
is not yet completed, The pupils make their own choice of the trade, and instruc- 
tion is given in actual work, both practical and theoretical, the former taking pre- 
cedence. With the present accommodations there are no advanced classes, but 
pupils often attend a second term, and not a few have taken a third term. 
The school was founded by the Master Builders’ Exchange, and though now incor- 
porated, still bears its name. The income is derived from instruction fees, from a 
small but increasing cndowment fund, and an appropriation from the State of Penn- 
sylvania—any deficit being made good by the Master Builders’ Exchange. The 
instruction fee paid by cach pupil is $27 for the term. 
The schools at present are divided into seven departments, in which instruction is 
given in the following trades, viz: Carpentry, bricklaying, plastering, stonecutting, 
blacksmithing, painting, and plumbing. 
Each department is furnished with competent instructors and is under the direct 
supervision of three members of the committee of that particular trade, and the 
schools as a whole are in charge of a superintendent.

MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1083 
     only haveabeen formed, but should a sufficient For the present, evening clas: 
ved to warrant the management in so doing, day number of applications be rece! 
classes will be established. 
Three evenings per week are occupied in the instruction of each class, two being 
devoted to shopwork and one to theoretical instruction, calculation, and drawing. 
The pupils begin work at once in the trades they have chosen. 
The present (sixth) term has 90 admissions in all, of an average age of about 18 
ears. 
» In mechanical instruction the instructors follow printed forms, the lesser details 
being left to their discretion, The theoretical instruction is given in the form of 
questions and answers, the pupils writing the latter from dictation, and any required 
explifiation is given on the following evening. These questions form the basis of 
the examination at the end of the term. Working drawings only are made, the 
object being rather to teach the understanding of plans than to mako draftsmen. 
Tho pupils are expected to have the elements of a common school education, and, 
if deficient, assistance is given. All the instruction is arranged to meet the prac- 
tical needs of those intending to become workmen at the several trades, 
The basement of the exchange building is used as a workshop and an upper floor 
for the drafting room. The shop is equipped with the usual hand tools of the differ- 
ent trades, and both tools and materials are furnished in both the shop and the draft- 
ing room. 
The cost of the plant is about $4,500 and the usual expenses of maintenance about 
$6,000 per annum, varying somewhat with the number of pupils. The majority of 
the pupils have been taken as apprentices by members of the exchange, who speak 
in very favorable terms of their acquirements, and are willing to reduce their term 
of apprenticeship where a certificate is obtained. Of those who complete their time 
with the same employer a record can be kept, but it is of necessity incomplete in 
the case of many. é 
It has but seldom come to our knowledge that pupils have taken up some oceupa- 
tion other than the trade learned at the school, and several who attended the carlier 
terms are now in business for. themselves. ~The later admissions have been greatly 
due to the recommendations of former pupils, and when these have been visitors, it 
has been with a satisfaction which they were very willing to express. 
It has been contemplated to add other mechanical trades in connection with build- 
ing when circumstances allow remoyal to quarters affording increased accommoda- 
tion. The present space is fully occupied, and in some trades the number of appli- 
cants has exceeded the capacity of the school.         
        
   
  WILLIAMSON FREE ScHOOL OF MECHANICAL Travers, WILLIAMSON ScHooL, Pa. 
[Statement of John M. Shrigley, president.] 
Our support is entirely from the income of the endowment fund given us by Mr. 
Isaiah V. Williamson. Our machine and carpenter shops are provided with hand 
and power tools and our bricklaying shop with all the appliances required in that 
trade. Our plant, including 200 acres of ground, has cost $426,757.36. The cost of 
maintenance in 1895, average number of pupils having been 163, total population 205, 
was $60,695.56. Our first class was graduated in the spring of 1894, and many of its 
members are now receiving full journeymen’s wages at their trades. A very largo 
proportion of our graduates follow the trades taught them here. We hayo not the 
exact figures at this moment, but 90 per cent of the entire number will closely 
approximate the percentage so doing.   
  [From a cirenlar of tho school, 1896.] 
This school was founded by Isaiah V. Williamson for tho purpose of giving poor 
and deserving boys a good English education, for training them in habits of morality, 
economy, and industry, and for teaching them mechanical trades. 
Only natives of the United States are eligible for admission, and no one will be 
accepted who is not able-bodied, intelligent, healthy, and possessed of natural apti- 
tude and liking for mechanical work. Candidates to be successful must also be of 
epee moral character and be sufficiently educated to readily enter on the school 
work. 
The school is only for pupils who intend to follow mechanical pursuits for a living. 
The scholastic examination is held four to five months prior to the date of admis- 
sion, and covers reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic, including fractions, and 
weights and measures, geography, United States history, composition, and language. 
All scholars are bound as indentured apprentices to the trustees for the term of 
three years, with the provision that tle indenture may be canceled at any time by 
the trustees for the scholar’s incompetency or bad conduct, or if for any other reasons 
the trustees think him unworthy of future and continued support and education.    
 
-P-A-G-E-126
    1084 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
By the indenture the scholar will be obligated to conform to all regulations and 
restrictions prescribed by the trustees or their representatives, and all right or claim 
to control them during the period they remain at the school will be vested in the 
trustees. 
Each scholar is given a preparatory course in woodworking and mechanical draw- 
ing, in connection with studies in the schoolroom and extending through six months. 
At the end of that period he is placed at one of the following free trades, the selec- 
tion of which is made by the trustees, due regard being given to the inclination and 
adaptability of the boys to the trades to which they are assigned: 
Woodworking in its various branches, such as carpentering, pattern making, 
cabinetmaking, etc. 
Building, including bricklaying, range, furnace and boiler setting, plasteriffg, ctc. 
Machine trade in all its usual details, including practical training in steam and 
electrical engineering, steam fitting, etc. Zs 
Each scholar takes but one of the trades named, and his instruction in mechanical 
and free hand drawing, which continues during the entire three years, tends in the 
general direction of his trade. The courses are systematic and thorough, and based 
on instructional methods. 
The branches taught in the academic department are reading, writing, arithmetic, 
algebra, geometry, physical and political geography, history, elocution, physical 
science, English literature, physiology and hygiene, civil government, chemistry, 
yocal music, theory of the steam engine, strength of materials, and building con- 
struction. 
The school and shops are in session eight hours daily on five days of the week and 
four hours on Saturday, each scholar spending about four hours in the class rooms 
and four hours in the shops daily the first year, the proportion spent in the shops 
gradually increasing toward the close of the apprenticeship. . 
The school term continues the entire year, but those pupils who merit it are given 
about two weeks vacation in summer and a few days at Christmas. 
Ample facilities are provided for in and out of door games, and each scholar, in 
turn, performs a moderate amount of open-air work. 
Scholars are required to bring with them a modest outfit of plain clothing, but 
while at the school no charge is made for boarding, clothing, or instruction, the 
benefits of the institution being free. 
‘The domestic life of the school conforms, as far as is practicable, to good family. 
government. To that end the scholars are divided into families of twenty-four, each 
having its matron and its own distinct home or cottage, cared for by its occupants. 
The homes contain no kitchens, dining rooms, or laundries, these being located in 
other buildings. % 
The trustees deem it to be quite as essential to have the pupils become good men 
as good mechanics, and special attention is given to their moral training. 
IV.—NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
GrorGia NORMAL AND INDUSTRIAL COLLEGE, MILLEDGEVILLE, GA. 
[From the Third Annual Announcement and Catalogue, 1894.] 
The object of the State in establishing this school is to provide for the young 
women of Georgia an institution in which they may get such special instruction and 
training as will prepare them to earn their own living by the vocation of teaching 
or by those industrial arts that are suitable for women to pursue. Subsidiary to 
these two main objects the institution also teaches those branches of learning that 
constitute a good general education. It furthermore instructs and trains its pupils 
in those household arts that are essential to the complete education of every woman, 
whatever her calling in life may be or in whatever sphere of society she may move. 
In other words, the purpose of the college is to prepare Georgia girls: (1) To do 
intelligent work as teachers, according to the best methods known to modern peda- 
gogics. (2) To earn their own livelihood by the practice of some one or other of 
those industrial arts suitable for women to follow. (3) To exert an uplifting and 
refining influence on family and society by means of a cultured intellect, which ean 
only be attained by a systematic education in the higher branches of learning. (4) 
To be skillful and expert in those domestic arts that lie at the foundation of all sue- 
cessful housekeeping and home making. (5) To accomplish this fourfold educational 
purpose, the courses of study to be pursued in the school are divided, in a general 
way, into four principal departments, namely : Thenormal department; the industrial 
department; the collegiate department; the domestic department. 
It must not be supposed that each of these departments constitutes a distinct and 
separate school. On the contrary, they are coordinate and coequal parts of one
-P-A-G-E-127
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1085 
complete system, and are so united as to form one harmonious whole. Many of the 
studies pursued in the college belong in common to all of the departments, but in 
certain lines of study the departments differentiate, giving rise to the above fourfold 
classification. 
- INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT. 
The object of this department is to give thorough instruction in those industrial 
arts that are suitable for women to follow as a‘means of livelihood. The department 
will confine itself for the present to the following branches: (1) Stenography and 
typewriting, (2) telegraphy, (3) bookkeeping, (4) dressmaking, (5) free-hand and 
industri@l drawing, (6) cooking. 
In selecting these from all the available industries, the authorities of the college 
had regard primarily to their business value and secondarily to their culture value. 
Carefully compiled statis show that the first four arts mentioned have a greater 
business value for women than any other employment whatever. The fifth in the 
list, namely, free-hand and industrial drawing, was selected mainly for its culture 
value, though if pursued as a specialty for two or more years by persons who have 
anatural aptitude for drawing, it will afford the most pleasant and lucrative means 
of livelihood of any of the industrial arts taught in this school. Cooking, the sixth 
and last art in the list, was selected almost entirely for its domestic or household 
value, 
  SCHOOL OF” DRESSMAKING. 
The whole practical work of dressmaking is taught in this department, including 
cutting, fitting, draping, hand sewing and machine sewing. Careful instruction is 
also given in the principal branches of sewing in white goods. 
The §. T. Taylor system of dressmaking, generally acknowledged to be the best in 
the world, is used. It is based on strictly mathematical principles, which insures 
accurate results, and, where it is well learned, guarantees a perfect and artistic fit 
an every case. Although thoroughly scientific, it is simple and not very difficult to 
learn. 
The department is furnished with an abundance of the very best and finest makes 
of sewing machines, and with all other furniture, implements, and devices that go to 
make up a perfect equipment. 
There are two classes of pupils who study this art in our college: (1) Those who 
wish to learn it merely for home or domestic uses. (2) Those who wish to learn it 
asa trade. For the first class, one hour a day devoted to the work throughout the 
session is usually sufficient, but for those who wish to become professional, artistic 
dressmakers, from three to five hours a day for at least one year are necessary. 
All pupils studying dressmaking are required, by way of practice, to make their 
own college uniform dresses, or to do any other work that may be required of them. 
by the principal. 
In order to afford those pupils who intend to make dressmaking a profession the 
practice absolutely necessary to acquiring a high degree of proficiency in this art, 
there has been organized ir. connection with the department a regular dressmaking 
establishment, which carries on the trade of dressmaking under strictly business 
regulations. The establishment is in direct charge of Mrs. Fannie Shealy, under 
whose careful supervision all work will be done. A number of licensed assistants 
from among the most skilled pupils in the department will be appointed for this 
establishment, and they will receive reasonable compensation for any work they may 
do. All contracts for work to be done must be made directly with Mrs. Shealy, and 
all money paid for work must pass through her hands. No work shall be done for 
pay in the dressmaking department except in this trade school and under these 
regulations. 
It is hoped that this will in time become one of the best and most artistic dress- 
making establishments in Georgia. The charges will be reasonable and all work 
will be strictly guaranteed. 
‘Those pupils who wish to learn cutting and fitting must provide themselves with 
the S. T. Taylor text-book and accompanying drafting and measuring instruments. 
The whole outfit costs $7, and can be purchased at the college. Pupils whe wish to 
take only sewing or any branch of needlework will not require this outfit. 
All students of dressmaking, unless specially excused, are required to take the 
industrial-English course of study. 
SCHOOL OF COOKING. 
This is the pioneer institution of the sort in the Southern States. Neither expense 
nor pains have been spared in fitting it up. During the three years of its existence 
it has accomplished much good, but in several important particulars it will do better

work next session than ever before. 'The course of study will be better adapted to 
the particular needs of the Southern kitchen and to the dietary of Southern house- 
holds than heretofore, and the methods of instruction will be more thoroughly prac- 
tical. To tho gas stoves and oil stoves with which the school is already abundantly 
supplied the common wood cooking stove will be added, so as to familiarize the 
pupils with its use. The aim of the course of study will bo to acquaint the girls 
with all the fundamental principles of cooking and to give them a practical training 
inthe most healthful and economical methods of preparing such articles of food as 
aro usually found on a well-appointed Southern family table. Spe: stress will be 
laid upon the making of plain bread and biscuit, the cooking of ordinary meats and 
vegetables, and the preparation of simple desserts; sufficient attention will also be 
paid to fancy dishes. Several special lessons aro given on cooking for invMlids. 
Each cooking class consists of twelve pupils and each class receives one lesson of 
two hours’ duration every week, and at each of these lessons every pupil in the class 
does actual cooking directly under the eye of the teacher. In connection with every 
lesson instruction is given in hygiene as related to foods, in the nutritive properties 
and values of the materials used, and in the chemical changes caused by cooking. 
Dining-room training.—As an adjunct to the cooking school there will be established 
next session a well-equipped, nicely appointed dining room, in connection with which 
girls will be taught to make ont bills of fare, to set the table, to serve meals, and to do 
everything in this branch of housekeeping in the best and most approved manner. 
They will also be carefully instructed in the etiquette of the table and in everything 
that constitutes good dining-room manners. Both in tho kitchen and in the dining 
room great pains will be taken to train the girls into habits of absolute cleanliness 
and neatness. 
The cooking schoel ccecupies a very large, conveniently arranged room in the top 
story of the college building. It is-equipped with the most improved implements 
and appliances. 
Tho cooking lessons are obligatory upon all members of the senior class. No stu- 
dent shall be awarded a diploma from this college until she has taken the course in 
cooking and has stood a satisfactory examination in the same. Ordinarily only 
seniors aro allowed in this department, but girls over 16 years of age who expect to 
be in the college only one year will also be permitted to take the lessons if they wish 
to do 
An incidental fee of $2 is charged in this department, and must be paid when the 
student’s name is enrolled in the class. No other charge is made,

MANUAL TRAINING IN THE COLLEGE DEPARTMENT. / 
[From circular of information for 1895-96.] 
AIM AND SCOPE. 
The aim of the department is (1) to train teachers and supervisors of manual train- 
ing and art education, and (2) to give instruction in manual training and art work to 
students pursuing major courses in other departments of the college, to special stu- 
dents, to pupils of the Horace Mann School and of the Macy Manual Training High 
School. Aided by the other departments of the college, this department gives not 
only the principles of teaching special branches and practice in such teaching, added 
to a thorough drill in subject-matter, but also a broad professional training, enabling 
graduates to view their specialty not merely as an isolated subject, but in its true 
relation to the other branches of education. As an experiment station, this depart- 
ment aims to assist in the solution of many problems connected with the introduc- 
tion of manual training and drawing into the public schools. 
EQuieMEnt. 
The home of the new department is the Macy Manual Arts Building. This build- 
ing, completely equipped, was given by Mrs. Josiah Macy as a memorial to her hus- 
band. Itis 147 feet long, 71 feet wide, and is five stories high, including a well-lighted 
basement. It occupies a commanding position, overlooking Morningside Park, the 
Harlem River, and Long Island Sound on the northeast, and Riverside Park, the 
Hudson River, and the Palisades on the northwest. The view from the upper win- 
dows can hardly be surpassed in New York City. It contains three large rooms for 
woodworking—joinery, carving, turning, and pattern making; four for metal work- 
ing—chipping and filing and soldering, molding and casting, forging and machine 
tool work; twofor clay modeling; one for mechanical drawing; one for architectural 
drawing; one for elementary manual training; two for elementary free-hand draw- 
ing, and two large studios for advanced drawing and painting. In addition to these 
is a lecture room, provided with a stereopticon, many smaller rooms, such as offices, 
store rooms, a library, museum, conference room, photography room, engine room, and 
stock room. 
The machinery, tools, cases, and furniture constituting the equipment of the vari- 
ous departments have been selected with special reference to the requirements of the 
work to be done in these departments. Whenever it has been impossible to find such 
furnishings in stock, special pieces have been made,

  1090 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The departmental library contains many hooks and pamphlets on manual training 
and art education. In the corridors and on the walls of various rooms are many 
photographs illustrating the history of art. In the museum and scattered through 
the work rooms are vases, reliefs, models, carvings, and casts. The purpose has been 
to make the building and its equipment complete { and inevery way adapted to its use.

universal milling machine, a grinding machine, planer, upright drill, sensitive drill, 
and the necessary smaller tools, all of which have been carefully selectéd from the 
latest patterns of the best tool manufacturers. 
18. Free-hand drawing and clay modeling.—Four periods weekly. A course from 
the standpoint of the teacher. The subject for the first part of the year will bo the 
work of the primary school; that for the last part of the year the work of the 
secondary school. 
19. Drawing and painting.—Kight periods weekly. This course is arranged so that 
the student first makes a light and shade study from the object or groun of objects, 
and afterward makes a color subject from the same object. This plan affords an 
opportunity for the study of black and white values in connection with color values, 
and emphasizes the importance of the light and shade work as applied to painting. 
The course includes studies from fruit, flowers, still life, and the human figure, and 
in the latter part of the year out-of-door sketching. 
20. Free-hand drawing.—Two periods weekly. A special course for major students 
in domestic art. 
21. Mechanical drawing.—Four periods weekly. The work of this course is taken 
up from the standpoint of method; hence a knowledge of the subject-matter is nec- 
essary on entering the course. During the course a comparative study is made of 
the mechanical drawing courses of elementary and secondary schools of recognized 
standing, with a view of arriving at conclusions as to what should be included in a 
coutse of mechanical drawing, and what method should be employed in teaching. 
The notebook work is an important part of this course.

manual training; methods of teaching manual training; planning courses of instruc- 
tion for elementary and secondary schools; the manual training high school—its 
distinguishing characteristics and its place in American education. 
23. Plans and equipments.—Two periods weekly, second half year. The teacher 
of manual training is called upon not only to lay out his courses of instruction, but 
often to plan and equip rooms for manual training work. With this requirement in 
mind, a course has been designed covering the essential principles involved in plan- 
ning and equipping for manual training work in elementary and secondary schools,
-P-A-G-E-134
  1092 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
In this course the following points are considered: Planning with reference to num- 
ber, size, and location of rooms needed; their light, accessibility, and convenience one 
to another; tools and appliances necessary for a given range of work; how to pur- 
chase tools and machinery; arrangement of these with reference to use, convenience, 
and safety of operation; location of line shafting; selection of motive power, 
hangers, belting, and other material required. 
Classes usually work from assumed data, although in some cases data is supplied 
by schools desiring the assistance of Teachers College in planning new buildings. 
In such cases the school furnishing the data receives a copy of the completed plans 
free of charge. 
24. Wood carving.—Four periods weekly. A course in two parts. The first part 
is a continuation of course 5, students being expected to work from their own 
designs. The second part is a course from the standpoint of method, which is adapted 
to secondary schools. In the second part students are expected to take accurate 
notes of all lectures, but are not required to make all the models. 
25. Drawing and painting.—Eight periods weekly. A continuation of course 19 con- 
sisting of studies in black and white and in color from casts, still life and from life, 
and out-of-door sketching in color. Talks on perspective, light and shade, composi- 
tion, color, anatomy, etc., are given from time to time as the work progresses. In 
this class much individual instruction is given, thus enabling a student to do 
advanced work in any branch he desires especially to teach. f 
26. Designing.—Four periods weekly. A course in principles of design, including 
a study of the historic styles of ornament. Working designs are made for: 
(a) Wood carving, (b) wood turning, (c) pyrography, (d) bent iron work, and

visors and special teachers of drawing. This course will include the study of 
conditions existing in schools; courses of instruction in drawing, modeling, and 
decoration; the adaptation of work to the ability of classes, to the season of the 
year, and to the equipment. Attention will be given to the correlation of drawing 
with other subjects. The relation between supervision and special teaching, the 
holding of teachers’ meetings, the giving of typical lessons, and the making of 
programmes will be considered. Equipments will be planned, material for the 
different grades in public and private schools selected, and the expense estimated. 
28. Free-hand drawing.—Two periods weekly. A course from the standpoint of 
method, beginning with primary work. It includes drawing from models and 
objects from nature, illustrative drawing, and modeling from typical and natural 
forms. This course is designed for major students in the departments of the kinder- 
garten and elementary teaching. 
29. Machine design.—Four periods weekly. The course involves the consideration 
of the strength of material and the form and proper proportion of such machine ele- 
ments as the following, which are employed to a greater or less extent in all forms of. 
machinery: Rivets, keys, bolts and screws, journals and their bearings, shafting, 
couplings, cams, and gears. Later the subject of machine design is taken up wit! 
reference to simplicity, proportion, beauty of outline, cored and ribbed sections, 
harmony of parts, ete. Finally, some machine is designed and a set of working 
drawings made. 
30. Architectural drawing.—This course in the elements of architecture will not be 
opened until September, 1896. 
31. Clay modeling.—A continuation of course 9, consisting of advanced work from 
the antique and from life. The course will not be opened until September, 1896.

mouths, it has been decided to opena summer school of manual training and art 
education at Teachers College in 1896. The entire equipment of the Macy Manual 
Arts Building will be utilized, including library, photographs, casts, models, and 
exhibits. 
Tt will be possible to offer courses in (a) psychology as applied to manual training 
and art education, history and principles of manual training, methods of teachin 
manual training, methods of teaching drawing, planning and equipping manua 
training schools; and (b) in wood joinery, wood carving, wood turning, pattern 
making, foundry practice, forge work, chipping and filing, machine tool work, 
elementary manual training, claymodeling, designing, outline drawing, light and 
shade, water-color painting, architectural drawing, mechanical drawing, and machine 
design. The work will consist of lectures, conferences, recitations, and practice. 
The number of courses opened will depend upon the demand, The school will be 
open six weeks. 
MACY MANUAL TRAINING HIGH SCHOOL. 
In order to provide better opportunities for observation and practice teaching in 
manual training and art work the Macy Manual Training High School for boys and 
girls was established in May, 1895. 
The general plan of the school requires the pupils to divide their time in school
-P-A-G-E-136
  1094 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 5 
about equally between English, mathematics, and other academic studies, and man- 
ual training and art work. Throughout the entire course of four years each regular 
student pursues six lines of study—language, mathematics, science, sociology, 
drawing, and mannal training. 
The course is so arranged as to fit a grammar- school graduate for the School of 
Mines, Columbia College, in three years. 
DEPARTMENT OF DOMESTIC SCIENCE AND ART. 
MAJOR COURSE. g 
This course is designed for those who wish to prepare themselves to become teach- 
ers of cooking and sewing in accordance with educational principles. 
Candidates for admission to this course will feel the need of a broad and liberal 
education. A good high-school course, with two years’ added experience as teacher 
or student, is the least that should be considered adequate; much more is desirable. 
All candidates for admission will be required to pass the examinations for entrance 
to the college. 
The course continues two years, and includes instruction in plain cooking and 
plain sewing, cutting and fitting; drawing; the application of chemistry, physics, 
physiology, and hygiene to matters of the household; psychology and general 
method, history of edueation, methods of teaching and practice teaching. 
From two to four periods weekly are assigned for observation and practice in the 
Horace Mann School. The assignments are changed as often as the best interests of 
the individual require. 
The laboratory work in cooking includes practice in all branches of cookery. 
More attention, however, is given to such economical and wholesome cooking as can 
be properly taught in public schools and ia industrial classes than to the preparation 
of elaborate dishes. Careful study is made of the different methods of applying 
heat to food materials, and in, these experiments the student learns to operate coal, 
gas, gasoline, and kerosene stoves and the Atkinson cooker, It is the purpose of the 
course to reduce cooking to a science by the exact methods of the chemical labora- 
tory. In all the processes the aim is to study the conditions and learn to control 
them until uniform results are obtained. 
‘The course in sewing includes all branches that are required by public and indus- 
Arial schools; plain sewing, plain embroidery, the drafting, fitting, and cutting of 
simple garments. A course of lectures is given on methods of teaching sewing; the 
materials and tools in use and their development and manufacture ; color in econnee- 
tion with dress and home furnishing; healthful dress; hygiene, ete. There is also a 
course of lessons in drawing and color for the study of the human form and drapery. 
A collection of raw materials, textiles, and tools for demonstration lessons has been 
procured, and is of great value to the student. 
‘Training is given in such details of departmental management as the purchasing 
of supplies and the planning of courses of lessons and equipments for cooking and 
sewing classes. A special feature is made of economical cooking and sewing outtits, 
and the student is given such practical problems as the planning of an inexpensive 
outlit for a class of” twenty and the making of the best selection of utensils to be 
obtained for a given sum. 
Occasional visits are made to the schools of New York and vicinity to study the 
conditions of the work, and many of the studonts acquire excellent experience by 
teaching ¢lasses in some of the mission schools in New York when the hours do not 
interfere with college work. 
  MINOR COURSES. 
The following minor courses are offered to those who do not intend to become 
teachers of cooking and sewing, but who desire a practical knowledge of the subjects: 
Cooking.—Five periods weekly. 
Sewing.—Two periods weekly. 
Art of costume.—Five periods weekly, 
Cooking.—One and one-half hours weekly, October 5 to March 14.

[Statement of W. W. Deatrick, director. ] 
Our manual training is educational, with especial reference to later work of the 
pupil-teachers in the construction of apparatus, charts, ete. 
The plant was established by the State Normal School and tuition is included in 
general charges. Materials are paid for by pupils.

MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1095 
Instruction is given in the senior year only. Average age of pupils about 19 years. 
In cardboard sloyd and wood sloyd pupils work from blue prints, which each one is 
required to make, The required course in cardboard and wood includes the making 
of geometrical forms, surfaces, and solids, which may later be used as apparatus, 
Turning, scroll sawing, metal working, are optional. Fifteen charts, covering a 
course in color, are required; also two large wall color charts. Ten large wall charts, 
astronomical, anatomical, physiological, or psychological are required. In making 
these, some must be drawn by the method of squares, some by pantograph, and some 
by the use of the optical lantern. Several charis of geographical projections are 
required. Five pieces of apparatus are expected from each pupil. Photography is 
taught to pupils electing the same. The chart making appears to be the most valu- 
- able feature of our work. Clay modeling occupies several weeks of the year. 
HZquipment.—Sixteen sets of wood-working tools; a full line of extra tools, not in 
lathes, wood and metal; gasoline furnace, photographic outfit, drills, vises, 
scroll saws, and optical lantern and slides. 
Four large work benches, each accommodating four pupils at a time; a long filing 
bench, running the entire length of the room; all in a large, airy, well-lighted 
room, in the basement of the ‘‘central” building of the school. The windows are 
all above ground and the floor is cemented. 
The value of tools, etc., is $1,000 to $1,200. No cost of maintenance, except as salary 
of instructor, is included in general current expenses. Instructors have other work. 
Pupils pay for materials used. 
The training in construction of apparatus and chart making has materially influ- 
enced the public schools. One superintendent says: ‘‘I can see an improvement in 
the schools of the county with reference to schoolroom apparatus since the intro- 
duction of manual training into the normal school at Kutztown.” 
The metric system is used in all measurements and cvery graduate must thus 
acquire a practical acquaintance with that system. 
The department is under the direction of the professor of psychology and pedagogy.    
Stare NormaL ScHoot, West CHEsTER, Pa. 
[Statement of George Morris Philips, principal.] 
We have a workshop well located in our recitation hall, about 70 by 30 feet, with 
an adjoining room about 30 by 25 feet. We have benches for 40 students, each fitted 
up with all the ordinary tools. Students in tho last two years of the normal course 
are required to spend three quarters of an hour per day every other day in the shop. 
During the first of those years they take substantially the graded course in wood- 
work of the Philadelphia Manual-Training School. The second year they spend in 
making school apparatus of various sorts, especially philosophical apparatus, which 
they are privileged to take with them to their schools when they leave. Working 
drawings are made by the students in all cases, and the work done from these draw- 
ings. All other students in the school are privileged to take this work and many do. 
In our model school the children, both boys and girls as young as 8 or 9, take it regu- 
larly with much pleasure and with satisfactory results. The course in woodwork is 
taken by the young women in the school just the same as by the young men, and 
their work is practically as good. We confine our work at present wholly to wood- 
work and the necessary drawing. 
V.—SCHOOLS FOR DEFECTIVE CLASSES. 
Tur AMERICAN SCHOOL FoR THE Dear, Hartrorp, Conn. 
[Statement of Job Williams, principal.] 
Briefly, the object of our manual training is to teach with a direct view to actual 
work. Every boy old enough to do so is expected and required to spend about three 
hours a day in one of our etre: 
We have a cabinet shop and a shoemaker’s shop. Tho expenses of the shops are 
a part of the general expenses of the school. 
About 25 pupils are taught in each shop. 
Cabinetmaking tools and shoemaking tools are provided. We use no machinery. 
CoLorApdo SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF AND BLIND, COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO. 
[Statement of D. C. Dudley, superintendent. ] 
The central idea in teaching industries is to form industrious habits. Few of our 
pupils follow the trades learned here, but they are willing to work at what they can ~ 
get to do.  
-P-A-G-E-138
  1096 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Two and one-half hours a day are required in industrial work, though such pupils 
as have any talent devote one hour a day out of this two and one-half hours to art. 
No charge is made for tuition. It is part of this school’s regular work. 
Branches taught: Printing, carpentry, and baking to deaf boys; mattress making, 
broom making, cane seating, piano tuning to blind boys; sewing, crocheting, knit- 
ting, dressmaking to deaf girls; sewing, crocheting, knitting, bead work, hammock 
weaving, and basket work to blind girls.. Pupils range in age in each shop from 8 
to 20 years. 
We have a beautiful building for the industrial departments and the shops have 
a reasonable amount of suitable machinery for hand work. 
The principal expense of maintenance is’salaries of foremen. 
The results are good in improving discipline of pupils while in school and forming 
an industrious habit, and the work is no hindrance to other studies.    
CoLuMBIA INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DuMB, WASHINGTON, D. C. 
[Statement of E. M. Gallandet, president. ] 
We give instruction to the boys of our Kendall school in carpentering and cabinet- 
making. We expect to give instruction in printing next year. To the girls we give 
instruction in sewing (including machine work), dressmaking, and housework. 
We do this mainly because of its acknowledged educational value. 
INSTITUTION FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE BLIND, JACKSONVILLE, ELBE 
[Statement of W. F. Short, superintendent. ] 
The central idea in our instruction is educational and with direct view to actual 
work or trade. Some form of manual training is obligatory upon all our pupils 
This institution is supported by appropriations from the legislature, aud there is 
no charge for board or tuition. 
All the branches of manual instruction are carried on throughout the school year 
and are arranged according to the age and capability of the pupil. 
The workshop is equipped with suitable tools and machinery. 
The cost of the workshop was $15,000. The annual expense of maintaining it and 
other branches of manual instruction is about $1,500. 
The effects of manual training upon other studies we regard as very salutary. 
The average length of the school life of the pupils is about twelve years. The 
pupils usually follow the occupation of the trades learned in school. 
MARYLAND SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF, FREDERICK, Mp. 
[Statement of Charles W. Ely, principal.] 
The central idea in our industrial instruction is the cultivation of habits of indus- 
try, training in the use of tools, with a view chiefly to acquiring such a degree of 
skill as to enable the pupil to turn his hand to any kind of manual work. We teach 
shoemaking, cabinetmaking, and carpentery, chair caning, turning, wood carving, 
\ and finishing. We also teach dressmaking and finer needlework. 
This manual training is carried on as a department of our school, which is sup- 
ported by the State. There is no charge for tuition except for persons from other 
States. 
The course in manual training is not commenced in any particular year, but is 
determined rather by the age of pupils. They-are placed in the industrial classes at 
10 to 12 years of age. It is our purpose to give each pupil training in the use of all 
the tools used in the shop to which he is attached. In the shoe shop, for example, 
every boy learns to perform every part of the making of a shoe, in the different 
grades of work, up to the cutting. The same rule applies in the other shops. 
We have a building recently erected, two stories in height with a basement, 65 by 
30 feet. The first floor is occupied by the cabinet shop, the other is divided between 
the shoe shop and printing office, while the basement is used for storage. An engine, 
15 horsepower, runs the machinery. The cabinet shop is supplied with a planer, 
jointer, circular saws, scroll saw, mortiser, tenon machine, turning lathe, all run by 
steam, and there is also a good equipmentof tools for cabinetmaking and joiner 
work. The printing office has a Hoe Enterprise Cylinder of the latest make, a small 
Gordon press and a good supply of type of considerable variety. In the shoe shop 
steam power is not used. We have several sewing machines and the usual tools 
found in a well equipped shop. 
Value of the plant, about $6,800. Cost of maintenance, $642.08. 
As a rule [ think the industrial training has tended directly toward making better 
scholars. Undoubtedly parents are better satisfied to have their children remain in 
school longer than they would if instruction looking toward employment were not 
furnished.

  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1097 
MicnIgaN SCHOOL FOR THE Dear, Firnt, Micu. 
[Statement of F. D. Clarke, superintendent.] 
Our manual instruction is with a view to actual work and a trade. Itis obligatory. 
This school is supported by the State, and no charge is made for tuition. 
Pupils or parents select a trade at the beginning of the sixth year, and are expected 
to continue at it at least a year. At the end of that year, for reason, are allowed to 
change. After the first year they continue till they know all of the trades we can 
teach. Our pupils in shops average from 12 to 21 years old, except art, drawing, 
etc., where they begin at 8. Number taught shoemaking, 38; cabinetmaking, 25; 
tailoring, 20; baking, 3; printing, 23; sewing, 57; art, 33. 
Our shops are fairly well equipped with tools and machinery. 
Cost, exclusive of buildings, $9,645.71. Annual salary of instructors, $3,700. 
Effect on other studies is good, and it lengthens the time we are able to keep our 
pupils. Many pupils follow the trade they learn at school, while almost all of them — 
acquire ‘the habit of industry” and work regularly and steadily after leaving school. 
I attribute the good habits of the deaf largely to this regular work at school. 
Iowa INSTITUTION FOR FEEBLE-MINDED CHILDREN, GLENWOOD, Iowa. 
[Statement of F'. M. Powell, superintendent. ] 
While we consider industrial training an essential and important part of the sys- 
tem of training, we have not yet a very systematic course on account of lack of 
facilities. There is provided a wood-working room with machinery and tools at cost 
of $2,000. In this division twelve to eighteen boys work at intervals during the day. 
The benefits derived are expected to be educational as well as preparatory to actual 
labor later on in life. Wood carving constitutes a part of the labor. In this the boys 
are benefited especially in hand and eye training. Wood turning, planing, and a 
variety of work are accomplished in this department. The majority of boys at work 
here also attend the regular school exercises; in this way it becomes a part of their 
educational training. 
On the same floor four to eight boys work at intervals during the day in leather 
work, for the same reason involved in other industrial work. In this quite a num- 
ber have become proficient in handwork, even where the mentality rates low. 
The expenses connected with this department are nearly counteracted by the sale 
of manufactured goods. There is a brickyard on the premises in which are made all 
the brick that enter into the construction of new buildings. Its sales also yield 
considerable profit. A number of the boys participate in this labor of production. 
Farming and gardening are especial sources for remunerative, as well as educa- 
tional labor. Forty to titty boys work in this department during the spring and 
summer, 
The industrial departments are carried on in connection with other branches of 
the institution so closely that we have not made any effort to itemize expenses sepa- 
rately. Each year we learn to appreciate more fully the value of industrial training. 
Onto INSTITUTION FOR FEEBLE-MINDED Youtm, CoLumBus, OuIo. 
[Statement of G. A. Doren, superintendent.] 
In connection with school work almost all the children are engaged in some kind 
of work about the house and grounds dependent upon their needs and those of the 
institution. They are instructed in farming and gardening, carpenter work, paint- 
ing, shoemaking, tailoring, sewing, and other kinds of work, with reference to the 
requirements of the institution. The industrial training is made useful in the eco- 
nomical working of the household. The children are happier to be occupied in this 
way when not engaged in schoolroom work, and are made self-supporting toa greater 
or less degree. The exercise, too, is very often very beneficial. Their education is 
with reference to life in the institution, the object being to brighten their lives in 
every way possible and to make them self-supporting. 
VI._SCHOOLS FOR COLORED PUPILS. 
Storrs ScHOOL, ATLANTA, GA. 
[Statement of Ellen E. Roper, principal.] 
We teach only sewing to girls. All take the course except those in the highest 
grade. The object of our teaching in this branch is primarily to render them com- 
petent to make their own clothing, also to teach them tidiness and a horror of rags, 
ED 96——35* 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  1098 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Several, having natural taste for sewing, have been able, after finishing our course, 
to get positions with dressmakers. We also teach dressmaking when it is desired. 
The industrial work is in connection with Storrs School, founded and supported 
by the American Missionary Society. 
SPELMAN SEMINARY FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS, ATLANTA, GA. 
[From the catalogue for 1895-96.] 
INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT. 
The industrial department is made a prominent feature in this institution. The 
results accomplished through the aid of the Slater Fund prove beyond a doubt the 
desirableness and practicability of industrial training in connection with our course 
ofstudy. Every year increases our firm conviction that labor of the hands fora 
part of the day, directed by skilled instructors, promotes good discipline, good 
morals, and good mental energy as nothing else can. Every woman should bea 
good housekeeper, for her own honor and the progress of civilization. For all, espe- 
cially for those who are to be teachers and mothers, we believe industrial training 
to be essential to give self-reliance and self-support. Our great aim is to make edu- 
cation practical. Hence all the boarders are required to learn the art of housekeep- 
ing in all its branches. The time of eight teachers is mainly devoted to this 
department. 
Regular courses of instruction are pursued, and certificates are awarded accord- 
ingly. Each student receiving a certificate in this course has attended the school 
at least two years, is of good moral character, and has served creditably in the fol- 
lowing branches taught in the industrial department: Chamber work, table work, 
dish washing, cooking, washing, ironing, and plain sewing. 
Printing is an elective study. Sewing, dressmaking, and printing may be taken 
by day scholars as well as boarders. 
HOUSEKEEPING. 
The daily routine of life in the institution gives practical instruction in house- 
keeping. Boarders take care of their own rooms, and of the schoolrooms, halls, and 
dining rooms. Every pupil is expected to give at least one hour daily to house- 
work, Each one has her duty to perform daily, and the assignments are changed 
once a month. By this means table work, dish washing, bedmaking, sweeping, and 
dusting, and all the other arts that make home neat and pleasant are taught to all. 
COOKING. 
The daily cooking for our family of boarders is done under the eye of the matrons 
by students. In addition to this, there is a class in cooking, consisting of the candi- 
dates for the industrial certificates, who study cooking as a science, with a regular 
course of instruction which includes both plain and fine cooking. Bread making is 
considered of great importance. 
WASHING AND IRON! 
  A large, airy, fireproof laundry gives ample provision for fine laundry work. Each 
boarder is expected to do her own washing and ironing under the supervision of a 
competent teacher. 
SEWING AND DRESSMAKING. 
Every boarding pupil is required to learn the art of plainsewing. There are four 
classes in sewing, and promotions are made from the lower to the higher as fast as 
the pupil’s proficiency will allow. Mending, the cutting and making of under- 
garments, and buttonhole making are taught. Fancy needlework is taken up after 
skill in plain sewing is acquired. Those desiring to learn the dressmaker’s trade 
ahorons aly: haye an opportunity to doso. The most approved methods of fitting 
are used. 
Day scholars who wish to make a specialty of dressmaking can enter for that 
branch alone. . 
PRINTING. 
One of the pleasantest trades open to women is that of compositor in a printing 
office. We call the attention of parents to our facilities for teaching this trade. 
Our printing office issues monthly an eight-page school paper, the Spelman Messen- 
ger; it also prints our annual catalogue, besides the letter and bill heads, envelopes, 
programmes, cards, and labels required for school use. This variety of work insures 
instruction in a variety of typesetting.

  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1099 
NURSE TRAINING DEPARTMENT, 
The profession of nursing the sick is to-day attracting women of all ranks, 
Every young woman should be familiar with the fundamental principles of good 
nursing, so that sho may care for her own health and that of her family. Many a 
valuable life has been lost for the lack of skillful nursing. All who contemplate 
sionary work should be prepared to nurse the sick. In no way can one be more 
sure of following in-the footsteps of Christ than in entering a sick room with a 
trained hand and a sympathetic heart. > 
We offer two courses, nonprofessional and professional. The former is for those 
who wish merely such instruction as will enable them to care intelligently for the 
sick in their own homes. The latter requires three years’ study. During the first 
two years physiology and the theory of nursing are studied in connection with 
English studies; during the last year the ontire time must be given to practical 
work. All the sick of the school are cared for in the Everts ward by the senior 
nurses, and they do district nursing among tho poor and private nursing in the fam- 
ilies of the rich. Certificates are given on the completion of the course. Every 
graduate must possess a good moral character, must pass satisfactorily the required 
examination, and must have acquired skill in practical work. It would be pos- 
sible for a person of good education to complete the course in two years by giving 
toit her entire time. Atlanta physicians constantly employ and recommend our 
graduates, who receive very high wages. Students under 17 years of age can not 
enter this course.     
  TouGALoo UNIVERSITY, ToUGALOO, Miss. 
[Statement of Rev. Frank G. Woodworth, president.] 
The central idea of the instruction is educational—the development of manual 
skill as part of the education of the whole person. Incidentally there is the impar- 
tation of such skill as will enable the student readily to use tools in actual work and 
give fitness for further technical instruction. ‘The manual work is obligatory, form- 
ing a part of the regular curriculum as much as does arithmetic or grammar. 
‘The chief support of its teachers is from the Slater fund. The tuition charge is 
$1 per month for the full school work. No special charge is made for the industries. 
There have been in the past year 110 pupils in woodworking and forging, 30 in 
mechanical drawing, 100 in needlework and cookery. The ages average about 18. 
So far as it is possible, the methods used are those of the better manual-training 
schools, like the Rindge School in Cambridge, St. Louis schools, and the Pratt Insti- 
tute. The time spent in the industrial period is ninety minutes per day. In all 
branches the endeavor is made so to teach that the pupils shall have ability to teach 
others. 
In addition to tho strictly manual training class work there is opportunity given 
for practice on finished work, and very creditable cabinet and iron work have been pro- 
duced. A somewhat unique feature in the girls’ industries is the practical house- 
keeping in the girls’ industrial cottage, a most admirably arranged and equipped 
building, in which cight girlsat a time can keep house for two months, learning all the 
practical details of household economy under the direction of a competent teacher. 
As a preparation for that home making which is so essential a part of the training 
of the colored people, if they are to rise at all, this cottage work is of incalculable 
value. e 
‘The material equipment includes a building 40 by 26 feet for the woodwork and 
drawing, with an addition 26 by 20 for the ironwork. There are full sets of 
admirably made benches and carpentry tools for 24 pupils, 4 forges, and full draw- 
ing outfits for 20. The girls’ industries are taught in aspecially constructed ‘‘indus- 
trial cottage,” of three stories, 30 feet square, having sewing and cooking class 
rooms thoroughly furnished, and the rooms for the housekeeping above mentioned. 
This building has been pronounced the most complete of its kind in the South. 
‘The value of the industrial plant used for purely educational purposes is $7,000. 
We have also painting, steam sawing, farming, market gardening, nurse training, 
which I do not include in this estimate. The annual expense of maintenance 
is $4,000. : 
The effort to coordinate the manual training with other studies has been attended 
with no small difficulty, but our observation has been that the hand work helps the 
bookwork. The habits which must be developed in successful manual work have a 
directly helpful effect on studies in general. It is found that industrial education 
becomes an inducement to lengthened school life. We have knowledge of many 
students who are making use of the industrial training received here as carpenters, 
blacksmiths, mill hands, mechanics. Some of them have been able to receive large 
wages through the acquired skill. Not a few of the girls are seamstresses and 
dressmakers, and many are making good homes as the result of the impetus and 
training given.  
-P-A-G-E-142
    1100 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
After nine years of observation and practical experiment, it is my opinion that the 
most valuable form of industrial education for the colored people is a combination 
of strictly manual training with the trade school. In each of the large schools all 
should have the opportunity for the best manual training and this should be obliga- 
tory, so that all may have the discipline of it and also the gain that comes from 
familiarity with tool manipulation. Then those who have special aptitude should 
have the opportunity for development through thorough technicaltraining. In this 
way the largest material lift can be given to the race. 
CLAFLIN UNIVERSITY, ORANGEBURG, S. C. 
[From catalogue of 1893-94.] 
DEPARTMENT OF MANUAL TRAINING. 
The advantages arising from the systematic training of the hand and the teaching 
of trades and industries, in connection with courses of literary culture, are so patent, 
that no excuse or argument is needed to convince the thoughtful mind of the wisdom 
of the undertaking. 
Over $80,000 have been spent in supplying outfits for the various industrial depart- 
ments of Claflin University, and it is the purpose of the management to make it a 
first-class manual training school. 
The object of the industrial feature is to give instruction in manual training and 
to teach trades in connection with literary studies. 
In order to provide for manual training, there is no effort to lower the literary 
standard of the university, to consume time that properly belongs to that depart- 
ment, or to detract in any way from the broadest and most thorough literary 
Culture.’ * -*<* 
Experience has demonstrated that the subjects taught in the literary departments 
receive a new inspiration from the practical applications which are made of them in 
the manual training departments. For instance, there is scarcely a principle of 
mathematics that is not found useful and helpful in the mechanical departments. 
Students soon learn that mathematics is as essential to them as the tools in their 
hands, and, consequently, a subject that has seemed abstract and uninteresting 
suddenly becomes one of the most entertaining in the curriculum. 
Claflin University has in successful operation the following manual training 
departments:

cations, contracts, etc. Lectures on buildings and superintendence. Lectures on 
historic styles of architecture and ornamentation. Lectures on ventilation. Prac- 
tice in determining the strength of materials. 
SCHOOL OF WOOD WORKING. 
This department is furnished with benches, tools, etc., for classes of 20, Lessons 
are given in mechanical drawing. Students are taught the names and use of tools 
and how to keep them in order. 
A variety of actual work is performed, such as building cottages, shops, repairing 
buildings, making and repairing furniture, ornamenting buildings and campus, 
pbuilding and repairing fences, making and repairing agricultural implements, etc. 
The following is the course of study pursued: (1) Exercises in methods of holding 
and using try-square, gauge, dividers, bevel, saw, mallet, chisel, and plane. (2) 
Elementary framework: Cross lap joint, tenon and mortise joint, end T. and M. frame, 
and blind T. and M. brace frame. (3) Lathework: Cylinders, spindles, handles, 
rosettes, exc. (4) Advanced framework: Miter lap joint, dovetail joint, lap dove- 
tail joint, methods of searfing, keyed joints, double dovetail puzzle, etc. (5) Small 
articles, embracing framework, nail driving, turning, scroll sawing, and miscella- 
neous work. (6) Cabinetwork: Sawing, turning, framing, wood carving, paneling, 
brackets, plain bedsteads, washstands, tables, etc. é 
WOOD WORKING BY MACHINERY, 
This department is supplied with 2 80-horsepower boilers, an engine, 2 planers, 
ripsaw, jig saw, cut-off saw, variety machine, 3 turning lathes, boring and mortising 
machine, tenoning machine, band saw, carving machine, shaping machine, paneling 
machine, sash machine, etc. Students are taught how to operate the machines and 
how to keep them in order. With these facilities the university has been enabled to 
do its own building, repairing, and to manufacture its own furniture. 
During the past year the industrial departments have put up a 4-story brick annex 
to the main building, 63 by 80 feet. 
SCHOOL OF IRON WORKING. 
This department is fitted up with 8 forges, driven by a steam fan, and with the 
necessary outfit of tools, vises, drills, etc. The course of instruction includes the 
care and management of the fire and lessons in heating, holding, and striking 
iron; drawing, upsetting, shaping, bending, punching, cutting, breaking, welding, 
hardening, and tempering steel. 
Considerable attention is given to repairing. Many shoptools have been made, 
such as tongs, hammers, swedges, fullers, punches, chisels, flatters, cleavers, hardies, 
headers, bending forks, tire sets, drawjacks, traverse wheels, wrenches, bevel 
squares, try-squares, screw-drivers, pincers, clinch knives, toe knives, shoe ham- 
mers, masons’ hammers, calipers, etc. Special attention is given to filing and finish- 
ing, and there are many specimens of work on exhibition that do credit to the 
department. 
This department is supplied with a planer, power drill, turning lathe, and a 
20-horsepower engine. 
SCHOOL OF MILLING. 
A first-class mill has been furnished, and students are taught hoy to grind corn 
into meal, grits, and hominy. Feed is also ground for the stock. 
BRICKLAYING. 
Students are first taught the names and uses of the tools; then follow lessons in 
the kinds of materials and their uses, mixing mortar, cement, ete. 
Practice is given in laying walls, corners, window and door caps, arches, flues, 
chimneys, cornices, ete. 
During the early part of the course good work only is sought, but later good work 
and speed are insisted upon. 
Instruction is also given in reading plans and specifications. Students who wish 
to stand at the head of their business will join a class in architectural drawing. 
Two large boilers were set, several foundations for buildings put down, forges and 
flues built, and a 4-story brick building, 60 by 83 feet, was put up last year.

PLASTERING. 
Special instruction is given in lathing, plastering, whitewashing, and fresecing. 
Samples of this work are upon exhibition at the university. 
This department is attractive, and many students have learned enough in one year 
to command good wages during their vacation. 
STEAM LAUNDRY, 
A commodious 2-story building has been furnished with the most improved laun- 
dry machinery, the entire outfit costing $4,000. The object of this enterprise is 
to give instruction in all that pertains to good laundering, so that young ladies may 
haye the advantage of their training in their aomes or may follow it as @ business. 
The work of the university is done here, and girls of moderate means may carn a 
part of their necessary expenses by doing extra work. 
SCHOOL OF PRINTING. 
This department has been under the management of an experienced printer. The 
office is furnished with two good presses, paper cutter, and a good supply of type and 
other necessary furniture. During the session of the school asmall paper is published 
four days in the week, known as The Claflin Daily. 
MOUSE PAINTING. 
Lessons are given in colors and naterials, and in mixing and applying the same. 
Instruction is given also in graining and staining woods; in lettering and sign 
painting; in glazing, and in “frescoing. Students become quite accomplished in 
this department in two years. 
MILLINERY. 
  
This is one of the most attractive and successful departments. Advanced students 
only aro received. They are taught to bleach and sew straw, and shape and trim 
hats and bonnets. The department is under the direction of a lady of large 
experience in the business. 
SCHOOL OF COOKING, 
Classes in cooking are taught both at the university and at the Simpson Home. 
The departments are furnished with the necessary implements and materials to do 
most kinds of plain cooking. We have adopted in part the methods used in the 
public schools of Washington and in part the methods taught at Chautauqua, 
Course of study.—Cooking: Definition, purposes, processes, and incidental and

PLAIN SEWING. 
All of the girls not members of the dressmaking classes are required to take plain 
sewing. So far as we are able we provide them with material for the making of 
useful articles, but many are kept upon sample or practice work. 
SIMPSON INDUSTRIAL HOME. 
Another important industrial feature is the Simpson Memorial Home, established 
by the ladies of Philadelphia, in memory of the late Bishop Matthew Simpson, one 
ot the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church. <A neat two-and-a-half story 
building, containing twelve rooms, has been erected and furnished throughout. The 
home is under the care of a matron, who gives daily instruction imthe art vf domestic 
economy. Several girls reside permanently in the home, and have the constant 
benefits of the same; others are sent by classes from the university for instruction in 
cutting, sewing, and ornamental work. 
COURSE OF STUDY IN THE SIMPSON INDUSTRIAL HOME, 
First term: Plain cooking, plain needlework, laundry work, general housekeeping, 
good manners. 
Second term: Bread making, cutting and sewing, laundry work, care of the sick; 
hygiene—lectures. Pastry cooking, dressmaking, fine laundering, hygiene, and 
sanitary regulations. Care of rooms, general housework, and work in the dining 
halls required every day. 
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. 
The School of Agriculture was established in 1872, and is sustained by a portion of 
the interest accruing from the land-scrip fund, the Morrill fund, and a small appro- 
priation from the State of South Carolina. The farm consists of about 120 acres of 
arable land and about 30 acres of pastureland. The farm maintains 7 head of horses 
and mules, 7 head of Holstein-Friesian and 7 head half Jersey cattle, 20 head hogs, 
and somé coops of choice fowls. The farm is under excellent cultivation, as its prod- 
ucts will indicate. 5S 
The crop last year was as follows: 1,000 bushels of corn, 1,200 bushels of sweet 
potatoes, 300 bushels of oats, 50 bushels of clay pease, 3 bales cotton, 1,009 gallons of 
milk, and vegetables and eggs. 
HORTICULTURE. 
This is a new department. Twelve acres have been planted in Irish potatoes, sweet 
corn, turnips, collards, cabbage, tomatoes, squash, melons, beans, okra, asparagus, 
egeplant, cucumbers, etc, 
‘These departments furnish employment and experience to students, and supply, at 
the market prices, provisions fresh and crisp for the boarding department. We hope 
to place these departments among the most attractive in the institution. 
Bisnor COLLEGE, MarsHati, TEX. 
[Statement of F, N. Goble, superintendent of the industrial department. ] 
Our idea in such instruction is educational, but with a direct view to actual work. 
We keep these as distinct as possible. The regular manual-training work is divided 
up as in most such schools, and is obligatory on all students, as all other classes are. 
The trade work is for those who wish to learn a trade, and they put extra time on 
the special trade they may select. 
The work is in direct connection with the regular school work, and no special or 
extra charge is made for it. . 
The principal work is in the academy, but begins in the grammar school and runs 
on up into the college work, though of a different character in each. The work is 
modeled after the best schools of the North, and is quite similar in many respects. 
The age of the pupils will probably be older in the same grades than in the North.
-P-A-G-E-146
1104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
We all feel that the effects of the industrial work show themselves in all the other 
school work in increasing exactness, dexterity of hand, neatness, and general good 
work. The department ee not been in operation long enough to give any definite 
answer as to the occupation of pupils. One effect of the printing office and the 
training the students have received there is that the standard of printing in the col- 
ored offices of the State has been raised. 
VII._MISCELLANEOUS INSTITUTIONS. 
Pratt InstrTuTE, BRooKiyn, N. Y. 
[From the catalogue of 1895-96.] 
Pratt Institute was established after many years of investigation on the part of 
its founder, Mr. Charles Pratt, of Brooklyn. Its object is to promote manual and 
industrial education, as well as cultivation in literature, science, ané art; to incul- 
cate habits of industry and thrift, and to foster all that makes for right living and 
good citizenship. 
It is now generally recognized that manual training is an important and necessary 
adjunct to the education of the schools, and that mind and eye and hand must 
together be trained in order to secure symmetrical development. Manual training 
aims at the broadest, most liberal education. While developing and strengthening 
the physical powers, it also renders more active and acute the intellectual faculties, 
thus enabling the pupil to acquire with greater readiness and thoroughness and to 
use more advantageously the academic education that here goes hand in hand with 
the manual. 
But the need of manual training as a developing power is not greater than that of 
industrial education,—such education and training in the application of knowledge 
as will give a more complete mastery of life, whether in domestic, business, or pro- 
fessional pursuits. 
Accordingly, the institute seeks to provide facilities by which persons wishing to 
engage in educational, artistic, scientific, domestic, commercial, mechanical, or allied 
pursuits may lay the foundation of a thorough knowledge, theoretical and practical, 
or may perfect themselves in those occupations in which they are already engaged. 
The institute is based upon an appreciation of the dignity as well as the value of 
intelligent handicraft and skilled manual labor. It endeavors to give opportunities 
for symmetrical and harmonious education; to establish a system of instruction 
whereby habits of thrift may be inculcated; to develop those qualities which pro- 
duce a spirit of self-reliance, and to teach that personal character is of greater 
consequence than material productions. Its purpose is to aid those who are willing 
to aid themselves. Its classes, workshop, library, reading room, and museuin are 
for this purpose, and while tuition fees are required, yet it is the endeavor to make 
possible, by some means consistent with self-helpfulness and self-respect, the admission 
of every worthy applicant. 
In accordance with these principles, the work of the institute is prosecuted upon 
several lines, with four distinct aims in view: 
(1) Educational, pure and simple; the purpose being the harmonious development 
of the faculties, as in the work of the high school. 
(2) Normal, the ultimate aim being the preparation of the student to become a 
teacher. Normal training is at present given in the department of fine arts; in the 
department of domestic art; in the department of domestic science; in the depart- 
ment of science and technology, and in the department of kindergartens. 
(3) Technical, or special training to secure practical skill in the various branches 
of industrial and domestic art, the handicrafts, the applied sciences, and, the 
mechanical trades. 
(4) Supplementary and special, intended for the benefit of those who wish to sup- 
plement the training of school or college by attention to special subjects conducing to 
more intelligent direction of domestic, financial, social, or philanthropical interests. 
The institute is provided with a liberal endowment, which enables it to make 
merely nominal charges for tuition, and, at the same time, to secure the best talent 
and facilities for the accomplishment of its aim and purpose. All receipts from 
tuition and other sources are used for the maintenance and advancement of its work. 
      
          HIGH SCHOOL. 
The high school of Pratt Institute aims, as far as is possible in the time given, 
to fit boys and girls for an industrious and useful life, whether the graduate begin 
life work immediately or after more advanced study. In the words of its founder, 
Charles Pratt, ‘the idea of the school is not to teach any trade, but to educate the 
panes work patiently, systematically, and constantly with the hand, eye, and 
rain.
-P-A-G-E-147
MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1105 
It is not expected that only pupils of peculiar mechanical or artistic tastes will 
undertake the work of the school; the course is planned to develop that culture, 
information, and character distinguishing the best citizenship. To this end, a 
thorough course in the usual academic subjects is supplemented by art studies and 
manual training. The technical studies of the course are given for their educative 
ower, 
a Such students as may be able to continue systematic instruction beyond the course 
of the high school are encouraged to enter other departments of the institute or to 
enter college. 
Subject to the approval of the principal, pupils intending to enter college may 
select such work as is required for admission to the college they desire to enter. 
The equipment to carry out the designs of the course is thoroughly complete, as 
permitted by the organization of the high school as an integral part of Pratt Insti- 
tute. A brick building with three stories and basement, south of and adjoining the 
main building on Ryerson street, has been erected for the especial use of the school. 
The academic classes recite here, and in the basement are a gymnasium, lockers, and 
bathrooms. The experimental and theoretical work of the natural sciences and the 
manual work for boys are carried on in the laboratories and workshops of the 
department of science and technology; the manual work for girls, in the depart- 
ments of domestic art and of domestic science; and the drawing, in the department 
of fine arts. 
The institute library is directly across the street from the high-school building, 
and supplies the high-school reading room with special collections of books for 
reference as needed by various classes. The museum of the institute maintains per- 
manent art and industrial collections in the school, besides lending material for class- 
room use. 
The cultivation of an appreciation of good art is sought throughout the whole 
course of study. Contributing to this result, a collection of over four hundred 
framed pictures is hung upon the walls of the high-school building. It comprises 
a permanent loan of the Century Company and photographic reproductions of art 
works, besides paintings lent by friends of the school. 
The expenses of the school for tuition are $45, payable $15 each term. The tuition 
for special classes, open only to members of Pratt Institute, is $3 per term for each 
class. In addition to tuition fees, students are required to provide their own books, 
drawing instruments and materials, clothing for use in shops, and, in the case of 
girls, most of the materials used in the work in sewing, millinery, and dressmaking. 
All tools and materials required for work in the shops are furnished by the school.

DRAWING AND ART. 
The drawing of the high school is threefold in character—constructive, represen- 
tative, and decorative. The work is both free-hand and instrumental, the two being 
carried forward in parallel lines throughout the entire course. The course includes— 
Constructive drawings.—W ork relating to the facts of form, namely, free-hand work- 
 
-P-A-G-E-148

ments, intersection of solids, and all drawing relating to machine construction. 
Representative drawing.—Work relating to the appearance of form, namely, free- 
hand perspective drawing, outline and light and shade from cast, pencil and pen- 
~and-ink sketching, and perspective drawing in color. 
Decorative drawing.—W ork relating to the decoration of form, namely, elementary 
design, historic ornament, decorative design in color, and clay modeling of ornament. 
IMustrated art lectures are given regularly cach year and an effort made to famil- 
iarize the student with the best in architecture, sculpture, and painting, as well as 
to surround him with influences likely to develop the love for the beautiful. 
ManvuaL WORK FoR Boys. 
In the educational work of the high school, the manual exercises stand in equal 
regard with the regular academic studies. ‘Their office is not to turn the student 
aside from intellectual studies, but to reenforce them; to prepare not for any parti- 
cular mechanical pursuit, but for the common activities of life. The discipline of 
care, patience, judgment, promptness, celerity, and skill is sought for in this work. 
The work for boys, which is under the direction of the department of science and 
technology, is given below. 
To carry out this work, the department is equipped with a series of shops and 
laboratories, which are supplied with every appliance that can in any way enlarge 
the scope or promote the efliciency of the instruction. 
The exercises of the bench-work course are designed to give practice in the use of 
the principal woodworking tools—the saws, the plane, the chisel. By use of the 
measuring tools, the pupil is led to see the necessity of laying out work with care 
in order to secure accurate results. After this, practice in joinery is taken up; at 
first with simple examples, and then, as the pupil becomes more skillful, leading on 
to more complicated forms and more difficult constructions. 
After the work at the bench, operations in wood turning are pursued. No line of 
shopwork affords so great an opportunity to develop the appreciation of form in 
design as does wood turning. The free outline of its projects offers constant illus- 
tration of the subtile qualities of curves, and every exercise affords an opportunity 
of presenting a model of good proportions and grace of form. 
Work in pattern making follows the practice in turning; the making of patterns 
requires operations both with the bench tools and in turning, and involves very 
exacting requirements of care and forethought. With his patterns already prepared, 
the pupil is introduced to the foundry, and there practices the operations of mold- 
ing in sand, 
‘The methods and applications of plaster casting in the arts are also explained at 
this time, and duplicates of clay and other originals are obtained by the students. 
Next comes forging. . Of all the shopworkin the school course, none is more bene- 
ic its effect upon the character of the pupil than this practice at the forge. In 
other kinds of work there is time for deliberation, but here one must “strike while 
the iron is hot,” must think quickly and act quickly. 
‘The exercises embrace a comprehensive course in drawing, bending, and welding 
different forms in iron. They end with the forging and tempering of a set of steel 
lathe tools, to be used in the shopwork of the later classes. The course is generally 
finished by the construction of some simple ornamental pieces, which serve to indi- 
cate the possibilities of wrought iron in this direction and to emphasize right prin- 
ciples of design. 
The last shop entered is the machine shop. 
The bench-work course comprises chipping, surface filing, straight, angular, and 
round fitting, and the making of calipers, try-squares, and inside and outside gauges, 
in sheet stecl. 
The first portion of the machine-tool course gives practice in plain and taper turn- 
ing and fitting, serew cutting, etc. After this come exercises introducing various 
operations on the different machines, and finally a set of taps, twist drills, and 
reamers is made and finished. : 
Practice in these, the most exacting of all mechanical operations, enforces methods 
of patient accuracy, and does much to develop the power of persistent, careful appli- 
cation. In addition to this, the work with the power tools affords an insight into 
the principles governing the action of machines, and an acquaintance with numer- 
ous examples of mechanical device in accomplishing various ends, 
      
   
MANUAL WORK FOR GIRLS. 
The subjects are chosen to afford the girls of the high school a training in the 
expression of thought and an exercise of the executive faculties similar to that 
obtained by the boys in wood and metal working, as well as to prepare for a more 
   
-P-A-G-E-149
  
MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1107 
intelligent administration of the home. They comprise cooking, sewing, dress- 
making, and millinery. 
These last three branches, which are closely related to each other and also to the 
course in instrumental and free-hand drawing, are under the direction of the depart- 
ment of domestic art. A room has been especially equipped for the classes, with 
everything which can inspire the student to do good work. The courses are based 
upon the same lines as those pursued by the special classes of the department, but 
are somewhat modified in order to increase their educational value and to bring 
them within the limited time allowed. 
The courses in sewing, dressmaking, and millinery are arranged to make clear the 
  fundamental principles of these arts, and to lead the students to appreciate the - 
necessity of forethought, design, accuracy, and thoroughness in all good work. 
The course in sewing occupies about four hours each week. Practice is given 
in all important varieties of hand sewing upon small pieces of cloth, muslin, cash- 
mere, etc., until a reasonable degree of proficiency is attained. During this time 
the student applies the knowledge gained to measuring, cutting, and folding 
squares, oblongs, triarigles, hems, square corners, mitered corners, ete. The nature 
and manufacture of materials used in the work are studied and are illustrated 
by specimens from the museum; and the management of different kinds of sew- 
ing machines is taught. Attention is also given to the position of the body and 
the care of the eyes while sewing. Considerable time is devoted to teaching mend- 
ing and darning, with practice upon articles of clothing brought from home by the 
pupils. 
é The pupils take measurements of each other, in order to learn cutting and fitting 
of skirts, and make simple garments, using both machino and hand sewing. 
Throughout the last term of the first year nearly two hours each week are devoted 
to making free-hand drawings and sketches of hats and dresses, in preparation for 
the courses in dressmaking and millinery which are taken up in the following two 
years. This study, in connection with tho general course in drawing pursued in the 
art department, leads the pupil to appreciate good form and proportion, and educates 
the taste in dress. 
In the course of dressmaking the students are first taught to take measurements 
of the figure and to draft skirts and waists. Here, again, they apply their knowl- 
edge of mathematics and instrumental drawing. When the student can make cor- 
rect drafts for all figures, she makes for herself a simple dress of cotton fabric. 
To st her in a proper selection of material, the teacher shows to the class samples 
of dress materials, explaining their suitability for different uses. A talk upon color 
and form, and their relations to dress, is also given. 
Four hours each week during the first and second terms of the third year are 
devoted to a study of the principles of making and trimming hats. Here the laws 
of form, proportion, and color must be observed. The pupils practice trimming 
upon straw and felt hats, using colored cotton flannel, sateen, and cheese cloth, in 
place of velvet, ribbon, crape, etc. These materials they purchase themselves, with 
as much care in regard to the color as if they were-to be worn. When the elemen- 
tary principles of millinery are understood, each pupil selects materials and makes 
for herself a finished hat. A house dress from an original design by the pupil is 
made, a thorough preparation for this final project having been gained by the previ- 
ous training in sewing, dressmaking, millinery, instrumental and free-hand drawing, 
and elementary design. 
The instruction in cookery is based upon laboratory methods, and is both theoret- 
ical and practical. The chemical, physiological, and economic consideration of 
foods leading to the science of nutrition forms a course parallel with instruction 
and individual practice in culinary treatment. The calculation of dietaries afford- 
ing a sufficiency of nutriment to meet the body’s needs, as estimated by standard 
authorities, is one form of written work required. The practical work includes 
simple invalid cookery, and the preparation of cereals, vegetables, meats, soups, 
salads, fancy desserts, cakes, frozen creams, a breakfast, a luncheon, and a dinner, 
    DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. 
This department affords instruction in various scientific and technical subjects, as 
well as a practical training for the principal mechanical trades. 
‘The instruction in manual training included in the high-school course is also under 
the direction of this department. To carry out this work the department is equipped 
with a series of shops and laboratories, which are supplied with every appliance that 
can in any way further the purpose and increase the efficiency of the instruction. 
Although the chief aim of the various courses is to afford instruction of direct 
value in industrial and technical pursuits, certain of the courses also serve to continue 
the education of those whose school training has been necessarily limited.

1108 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96, 
Norma Ciass Iv Manva TRanina. 
This course has been organized in response to the large number of applications 
received for trained teachers of manual training in the upper grammar and high- 
school grades. 
The work of the course occupies the entire school session from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. 
upon five days of each week, and requires in addition a considerable amount of time 
devoted to study. 
A thorough study of the practical details of manual training is obtained by a large 
amount of practice in each of the shops, and by special instruction in regard to 
methods of presentation. The problem of equipment is considered at some length. 
The cost of tools and fixtures is carefully compiled, and plans for different con- 
ditions of school work embodying all details of construction and expense are pre- 
pared by the class. 
The courses of the most prominent manual training schools of the country are 
illustrated by drawings and models, and the character and sequence of the exercises 
are analyzed. The history and present condition of manual training work in the 
pied Rates and European countries is studied, and considerable reference reading 
is required. 
Among the other subjects considered are: A history of tool development from the 
tude implements of the Stone age to the highly specialized forms of to-day; prin- 
ciples of teaching as applied to manual training instruction; coordination of studies; 
mechanical and free-hand drawing. Systematic instruction in physcology and the 
history of education is afforded throughout the course. 
For students who have had considerable experience in practical work and who 
wish to give special attention to one particular branch a course of one year is 
arranged. 
DRAWING AND Macuine Dusian. 
The course aims primarily to furnish a thorough training in mechanical drafting, 
but is also designed to afford a sound equipment to all desiring a knowledge of 
machine construction. The work occupies the entire school day, the mornings being 
devoted to drawing and the afternoons to mathematics, technical studies, and 
shopwork. 
The course in drawing covers working drawings, projection, development and 
intersection of surfaces, machine and engine details, problems in mechanism, assem- 
bly andshop drawings, and finishes with problems in construction and machine design. 
Besides the above, students are required to take a considerable amount of work in 
free-hand drawing. 
The instruction in mechanism, theory of steam engine, and strength of materials 
is planned to give a sound knowledge of the principles underlying machine con- 
struction. 
The class room instruction in the last two subjects is supplemented by a large 
amount of practical experiment in the steam and testing laboratories. In order to 
deal most efficiently with the above subjects, instruction in algebra and geometry 
is given throughout the two years, and a course in elementary physics, including the 
subjects of mechanics and heat, is given in the first year. 
Practice in shopwork occupies the latter part of the afternoons, and comprises a 
progressive course in joinery, turning, pattern making, molding, forging, and 
machine work. 
A study of the processes of iron and steel production, which serves to prepare the 
student for’ the work in strength of materials, is taken during the course, and the 
various branches of the subject are illustrated by visits to the iron and steel plants 
in the vicinity. TRADE CLASSES. . 
The day courses in carpentry and machine work prepare beginners for practical 
work at the trades. 
These courses are a modern siibstitute for the old apprenticeship system. During 
the school training the entire attention is given to the development of the learner, 
and the large waste of time inevitable under the old system is avoided. Theschool 
does not aim to turn out journeymen mechanics, but to afford a training that further 
practice in active work will perfect. 
The hours of session are from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. for five days each week, giving 
practice for 35 hours per week, 
The evening courses of the department afford to the students in these classes val- 
uable opportunities to study the mathematical and theoretical subjects bearing upon 
the trades. CARPENTRY. 
The course is one yearin length. Practice is first given in the use of saws, planes, 
chisels, and laying out tools, and is followed by a thorough course in joint work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1109 
After this practice a model of a frame house is made, and the different methods of 
framing are illustrated. Partitions are set and bridged, and floors laid. Door and 
window frames are made and placed in position, and the house is sheathed, clap- 
boarded, shingled, and corniced. Finally, inside trimming is taken up; doors, 
sashes, and shutters are made and hung; wainscoting, baseboards, and stairs 
built, ete. 
Systematic instruction in drawing is given during the course, and constant prac- 
tice in laying out work from plans is obtained. 
MACHINE WORK. 
This course is one year in length. Bevel, surface, and keyway chipping are first 
practiced, after which the class is put upon straight surface filing until ability to 
file straight and true is obtained. This is followed by straight, corner, round, and 
dovetail fitting, free-hand filing, filing to templet, making calipers, square, bevel, 
and gauge in sheet steel, use of taps and dies, and practice in scraping. 
The tool work gives practice on the engine lathe in plane and taper turning, chuck- 
ing, and boring, outside and inside screw cutting and fitting; after this, exercises 
are introduced in hand turning, followed by varied operations on the planing 
machine, shaper, drill, drilling machine, and grinding machine. , The theory of cut- 
ting tools is analyzed and the construction of the different machines explained. 
After the above course is completed, constructive pieces are gradually introduced, 
and throughout the remainder of the course the student is constantly employed upon 
examples of practical work. 
Systematic practice in forging, ending with making and tempering of steel tools, 
as well as instruction in making working drawings, is given in this course. 
PLUMBING AND FRESCO PAINTING. 
With the completion of the new trades school building for the ensuing year, it is 
proposed to open day classes in plumbing and fresco painting, provided a sufficient 
number of applications are received. 
EVENING TRADE CLASSES. 
The evening classes aim, principally, to broaden and extend the training of those 
already engaged at the trades. 
Carefully arranged courses of practical work are provided, in which the reason of 
each step is clearly explained. Frequent talks on methods and materials are given 
throughout the courses. Under such a system time is economized to the utmost 
extent and progress is necessarily rapid. 
Applicants must be between 16 and 25 years of age. All courses are at least six 
months in length, and no applicants will be admitted later than two weeks after the 
beginning of the term. All tools and materials are furnished without extra charge. 
The hours of session for evening classes are from 7.30 to 9.30 on Monday, Wednesday, 
and’ Friday of each week. 
CARPENTRY. 
The plan of work is similar to that described under the day class, but is greatly 
abridged in amount and variety. About one-half of the course is devoted to practice 
in the use of tools and to joinery, and the remainder to house construction. 
MACHINE WORK. 
The course follows the same general lines as those laid down for the day classes, 
but is necessarily limited to practice work. Construction is not attempted. The 
course requires two years for its completion. One term is spent upon bench work 
and three terms upon the machine tools. 
PLUMBING. 
The Journeyman Plumbers’ Association of Brooklyn cooperates in the direction of 
these classes. At the end of a two-years’ course a committee of the association 
examines: the members in regard to both manual skill and knowledge of trade 
methods, and awards certificates to those showing satisfactory proficiency, which 
certificates, in case of the holder afterwards applying for admission to the association, 
are accepted in place of the examination of like character otherwise required. 
The plumbing shop is equipped for about 50 pupils, each member having a gas 
furnace for melting solder, and a drawer holding a set of tools. Instruction is both 
practical and theoretical, lectures being given from 8.30 to 9,30 every Wednesday 
evening. fi 
The manual work includes the use of, tools; preparing wiping cloths; making soil; 
tinning soldering iron, brass, iron, lead, and tin; making solder; soldering seams;

making cup joint, overcast joint, straight-wiped joint, flange joint, and branch joint; 
working sheet lead into bends, traps, service boxes, and safes; lining tanks; calking 
iron pipe joints, and bending with sand and kinking irons. 
The lectures deal with the material used in the trade; the proper arrangement of 
drain, soil, and waste pipes; trapping and ventilating the same; supply pipes; 
boilers; tanks; fixtures, and pumps. Charts and diagrams are freely used in the 
instruction, and the examples of defective plumbing illustrated in the trade journals 
are fréquently studied. Special pains are taken to make clear the principles under- 
lying the plumbing rules of the city of Brooklyn. 
HOUSE, SIGN, AND FRESCO PAINTING. 
Tho Master Painters’ Association of Brooklyn cooperates in the direction of the 
painting classes. At the end of the course a committee of the association examines 
the work of the students and awards certificates to those showing satisfactory 
proficiency. 
The equipment for the house-painting class consists of screens containing doors, 
windows, and wainscoting; and for the fresco workers, of booths, plastered on sides 
and ceiling, with varied forms of cove and cornice. In addition to these, two large 
rooms containing facilities for drawing from the cast are provided for the advanced 
work in fresco painting. 
House painting.—The house-painting course includes both elementary and advanced 
classes, the former having practice in the preparation of surfaces, mixing paints, and 
plain painting on wood, brick, and plaster surfaces; and the latter in varnishing 
and hard-wood polishing, polish white, gilding, lining, graining, and paper hanging. 
Lectures are given on the harmony of colors, mixing colors, proportion of oils and 
driers, and the various materials used in painting. 
Sign painting.—The instruction includes preparation of surfaces, spacing, and plain 
lettering, followed by ornamental lettering in gold and colors, and painting on glass 
and metal. 
Fresco painting.—This course extends over three years. Its purpose is not only to 
afford training in the technical practice of the trade, but also to provide for the 
thorough study of fresco design. 
In the first year instruction is given in preparing walls and ceilings in kalsomine, 
in lining, laying out work, making and applying pounce and stencil, and putting on 
flat and shaded ornaments, 
‘The next two years are devoted to the study of design, and include practice in free- 
hand drawing, drawing and painting relief ornament, study of historic ornament, 
and composition of ornament for wall and ceiling decoration. 
Candidates for the advanced work who have not taken the elementary course are 
admitted only on approval of some member of the Master Painters’ Association, or 
after giving satisfactory proof of proficiency in plain fresco painting. 
DEPARTMENT OF DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 
‘The purpose in the domestic science courses is to afford training and instruction in 
these special subjects which must be considered in the daily administration of every 
home. 
To meet the varied needs of students in these lines, courses affording both theo- 
retical and practical instruction are offered. Large, well-appointed chemical and 
physical laboratories, attractive kitchens, valuable charts and models, an extensive 
library, and a rich museum, here constitute an efficient equipment for theoretical 
and practical work. 
LECTURES, 
The work of the normal course is supplemented by a series of lectures, open to the 
public, given by special investigators in their different fields. 
‘NorMAL COURSE (FIVE DAYS EACH WEEK TWO YEARS). 
This course, which requires two years for its completion, aims to meet the 
increased demand from the secondary schools for teachers thoroughly trained in 
domestic science. 
Instruction will be given by means of lectures and recitations, supplemented by as 
inch laboratory work as the best methods demand. 
First year.—Drawing, German, physics (energy and heat), chemistry (general and 
qualitative), biology (bacteriology and physiology). 
Second year.—Chemistry (quantitative), chemistry of cooking, chemistry of foods 
and calculation of dietaries, household science; emergencies, home nursing, and 
hygiene; public hygiene; original work (thesis).
-P-A-G-E-153
  
MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1111 
The applied work includes courses in cookery, laundry work, and sewing. 
The field-work involves a study of manufacturing processes, Through this real 
knowledge of commercial methods is acquired a valuable fund of information of 
practical use. 
Psychology and the history of education, together with instruction in normal 
methods, observation of class work, and practice in teaching, receive due attention 
throughout the two years. 
In-the last term of the second year, a thesis is required of each diploma candidate, 
which tests her ability to do original work. 
A brief consideration of some of the more conspicuous branches of the normal work 
will reveal something of its philosophy. 
Chemistry and physics.—A trained intelligence being the aim, subjects contributing 
alike to training and to technical acquirement are fundamental. Following the 
steps that all properly conducted laboratory work involves, the study of physics and 
chemistry will develop the daily demanded power to observe, to compare, to con- 
elude, Among the desirable habits formed will be those of system, accuracy, and 
economy. Aside from this inestimable training of mind and hand, any serious 
consideration of physiology and of foods requires the technical acquirement that 
these subjects confer. 
The chemistry of cookery and of foods, the study of ferments, of food adulterations 
and their tests, naturally follow as the resultant of the previous studies. 
Bacteriology.—The bearing of bacteriology upon sanitary science renders desirable 
a scientific and practical study of this side of biology. Primarily the purpose is to 
show that cleanliness is a first condition of sanitation. 
German.—A reading knowledge of German is necessary for bacteriology, as well as 
for physiological chemistry, which is an essential feature of a scientific study of food 
problems. : 
Household science.—The essential principles of house sanitation, household art, and 
household economy are taught by means of lectures, recitations, laboratory and 
field work. 
The principal laboratory work includes tests for impurities in water, the study of 
antiseptics and disinfectants, the determination of the ‘flashing point” of oils, and 
other investigations bearing directly upon the topics. 
The field work comprises the study of sanitary conditions and appliances and 
their application in private and other houses. 
Emergencies, home nursing, and hygiene.—The aim of these courses is to give a sound, 
if limited, knowledge of the laws of health, to enable women to care intelligently 
for sudden illness or accident, and to perform the duties of nurse where trained 
service is not employed. 
Public hygiene.—The courses devoted to the consideration of house sanitation and 
to individual hygiene culminate naturally in the study of problems concerning the 
public health or the care of the body politic. Ss 
For detailed outlines of these subjects, see Special Courses. 
Cookery.—The aim of the work in this direction is to illustrate applied science, 
physics, chemistry, and physiology. 
The instruction based upon laboratory methods is both theoretical and practical. 
Tho chemical, physiological, and economic consideration of foods forms a course 
parallel with the instruction in the culinary treatment. = 
Oecasional papers are required treating of various food ingredients and foods. 
Tho composition, sources, chemical and physical tests, microscopic features, food 
value, and cost are some of the topics discussed. A nutritive, attractive, and varied 
Vill of fare, ataminimum cost, is another form of written work occasionally required. 
The elementary practical work includes a course in invalid cookery, the prepara- 
tion of cereals, vegetables, batters and breads, meats, soups, salads, fancy desserts 
and cakes, frozen creams, a breakfast, a luncheon, and a dinner. Advanced courses 
follow the elementary courses, 
Laundry work.—Theoretical and practical instruction is given in the twelve lessons 
forming the course in laundry work. A study of the principles underlying the vari- 
ous processes is followed immediately by individual practice in these processes. 
Soaps, starch, washing fluids, bleaching powders, and bluings are chemically and 
practically considered. Visits to the manufactories of these articles form a feature 
of the work. In the practical work every variety of article, from bed linen to the 
most delicate colored embroidery, is laundered. 
Sewing.—The requirements include hand and machine wotk, the cutting and inak- 
ing of several pieces of underwear, and theory and practice in drafting a gown. 
While the normal course thus briefly outlined is designed especially for students 
preparing to teach domestic science, its classes are open to all women qualified to 
enter, who desire the preparation thus afforded for the serious duties and the fine 
art of home keeping.

DEPARTMENT OF DOMESTIC ART. 
This department provides comprehensive and systematic courses of study in those 
branches which are related to healthful and appropriate clothing of the body. 
The laws of nature as interpreted by science and art are studied in their bearing 
upon the physical development and clothing of the human body. Such study leadg 
to more healthful living, and to the cultivation of good taste and wise economy, an¢ 
supplements the education usually gained in school life. The courses now given are: 
Sewing.—Hand and machine, drafting and making garments, study of materials. 
Dressmaking.—Drafting, cutting, fitting, and making dresses and jackets. Form, 
color, design, study of textiles. 
Millinery. — Drafting, making and trimming hats, bonnets, and caps. Form, color, 
design, study of materials. 
Drawing.—Sketching dresses and hats in pencil and in water color; outline and 
proportion of the human form; historic costume. 
Physical culture.—F ree exercises and exercises with light apparatus to stimulate 
and develop all parts and organs of the body. Special exercises to strengthen weaker 
members. 
Normal course.—Sewing, dressmaking, millinery, drawing, physical culture, and 
normal methods. 
General course.—Domestic art and domestic science. 
The courses of instruction are carefully graded, not only to insure a thorough 
knowledge of the subject, but also to impress upon the pupil the value of order, 
aceuracy, economy, and logical sequence. The methods of instruction are such as 
lead pupils to grasp the artistic and scientific principles underlying all good work, 
and encourage them to observe and judge for themselves, thereby gaining self- 
reliance, 
The rooms devoted to the work of the department, situated on the third floor of 
tke main building, are large, sunny, well lighted and ventilated, and fully equipped 
with the apparatus essential for good work. The electric lights are so arranged as 
to allow work to be carried on with as much comfort in the evening as in the day. 
The rooms are also provided with casts of the best sculpture and photographs and 
colored plates of costume. The museum contains many specimens of textile fabrics, 
both ancient and modern, and affords pupils ample opportunity for study. The 
library is also an important factor in the usefulness of this department. The best 
and latest books treating of domestic art and science are constantly added, and mate- 
rial on the topic in hand is collected for the pupils. 
LECTURES. 
  Public lectures on subjects closely related to the work are given during the year 
by well-known specialists. Attendance is expected from the pupils. 
Norma Course (FIVE DAYS EACH WEEK—TWO YEARS). 
This course is organized to fit women to fill the increasing demand for trained 
teachers of domestic art in public and industrial schools, 5 
Applicants are admitted only in September, and must be at least 20 years of age. 
In addition to the general institute examination for normal courses, a spécial prelim- 
inary examination in technical ability is required to prove the applicant’s knowledge 
of the cutting and making of garments. 
The course of study will require the entire time of the student for five days each 
week, and will cover the full regular courses in sewing, dressmaking, millinery, and 
physical culture. Instruction in normal methods, the history of education, obser- 
vation of class work, and practice teaching form a part of the course. 
For students who have had considerable experience in practical work and who 
wish to specialize upon one particular branch, opportunity will be afforded to finish 
the course in one year. 
SEWING. 
The full course is divided into four parts, each of which is arranged to cover one 
term of the school year. Applicants are required to pass an examination in simple 
fractions, and must be at least 15 years of age. ; 
The first term comprises instruction in all the different stitches used in hand sew- 
ing, including patching and darning. Practice is given in all the various stitches 
upon small pieces of suitable materials, which are furnished by the school; other 
materials are furnished by the pupil. In the second term sewing by machine is 
introduced, and the pupil is taught the use and care of various machines; also draft- 
ing, fitting, and making drawers and skirt.
-P-A-G-E-157
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 4015 
In the third term the student is taught to draft, cut, fit, and finish a dress of wash- 
able material, without a lining, and to cut and make from pattern either a dressing 
sacque or shirt waist. This part of the course, satisfactorily completed, fits the 
pupil to enter the dressmaking and millinery classes. 
The fourth term is devoted to fine hand and machine sewing, and the making of a 
child’s dress, dainty undergarments, and baby linen completes the course. 
In connection with the course, talks are given upon the various materials used, 
with special reference to judicious purchasing. A collection of specimens of the 
different kinds and qualities of materials used is arranged in the class room for the 
inspection of the pupils. 
Pupils are required to record in notebooks, which are submitted for correction, 
the instruction received at each lesson, and written examinations are given during 
the cou A certain amount of sewing is required to be done at home between the 
lessons. The following is the course of study: 
Varieties of stitches used in hand sewing; patching, darning, and making of 
buttonholes and eyelets; talks on the nature and manufacture of the materials used ; 
machine stitching; practice in taking measures; drafting, cutting, and making 
drawers and skirt; advanced machine work; eutting, fitting, and making dressing 
sack or shirt waist; drafting, fitting, and making a dress without lining; drafting, 
cutting, and making nightdress; drafting and making baby’s dress by hand; child’s 
dress made from pattern by hand and machine. 
Special course.—(Four mornings each week—six months.) The class is organized 
in September, and completes in six months the full course as deseribed above. It 
has been arranged for those who can devote their entire time to the study. The 
students meet on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 9 to 1 o0’clock. Suf- 
ficient home work is required to oceupy the rest of the day. This class is a satis- 
factory one for those who wish to become seamstresses or desire to complete the 
course in as short a time as possible. Upen the completion of the second grade, 
orders received for undergarments and wash dresses are executed by the pupils, who 
in this way are able to pay their tuition in part. Once a week the students attend 
the lectures on the history and development of art, given by the director of the 
department of fine arts. 
Applicants must be at least 16 years of age, and are required to bring for inspec- 
tion a garment, made by themselves, which shows some knowledge of hand and 
machine sewing. They must also pass an examination, including hand sewing and 
simple fractions, which proves their ability to take up the work. 
Children’s classes.—These classes meet from 9.30 to 11.30 o’clock on Saturday 
mornings, and are for children between the ages of G6 and 15 years. The course of 
study has been arranged to suit their capacity and to arouse theirinterest. Children 
learn to sew easily and with pleasure, thus laying a foundation for beeoming good ~ 
workers in later years. Throughout the course the pupil writes in a notebook the 
important points of each lesson, illustrating as fully as possible by diagrams. The 
following is the course of study: 
Method of threading needle, making knot, and using thimble; position of body 
while sewing; running; basting and overhanding; method of weaving explained; 
turning hems by measure and hemming; making workbag; stitching, backstitching, 
and overcasting; felling; talk on the manufacture and history of the needle and thim- 
ble; gathering, stroking gathers, and putting on bands; making an apron for doll; 
making buttonholes and eyelets; sewing on buttons; putting in gussets; herringbone 
stitch on flannel; talks on the nature of emery and of wool; chainstitching, feather- 
stitching, and mitering corners; making flannel skirt for doll; hemmed and over- 
handed patching; talk on the growth and manufacture of cotton; hemstitching, 
hemming, and whipping ruffle; darning; darning on cashmere; French hem on 
damask; machine stitching; drafting and making drawers; drafting, cutting, and 
making skirt; cutting and making underwaist. 
        DREsSMAKING. 
The complete course is systematically graded, and is divided into four parts, each 
of which covers a term of theschool year. Two lessons a week, of three hours and 
ahalf each, are given, two hours being devoted to practical work and one hour and 
a half to free-hand drawing and design. 
Applicants must be at least 18 years of age, and must have successfully completed 
the first, second, and third grades of the sewing course, or must submit samples of 
their work which prove their knowledge of hand and machine sewing and their 
ability to make simple garments and cambric dresses.. An examination, including 
simple fractions, is also given. 
Materials used are selected.and furnished by the pupils. Large tables for drafting, 
tracing, and cutting ; sewing machines, dress forms, mirrors, books of models, samples 
of dress materials, and lockers for storing work are supplied by the school. *
-P-A-G-E-158
    1116 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
In order that the pupil may gain a knowledge of design and the ability to origi- 
nate and make tasteful garments, talks are given throughout the course on hygiene, 
on the selection of fabrics, and on form and harmony of color in dress. 
During the first term the principles of cutting skirts from measure, and of neatly 
finishing and hanging them, are taught. Close-titting waists are cut from a pattern 
made for each pupil according to the system used throughout the course. Pupils are 
shown a variety of materials, and are instructed in regard to the texture, color, and 
suitability of each for various uses and for different types of wearers. The talks on 
form treat of the most becoming manner of making a dress. by adapting the lines of 
the material to those of the figuze, and in selecting trimmings suited to the material 
and to the character of thetigure. Dresses are planned to carry out these principles. 
Each pupil is required to complete one dress for herself, and to do as much practice 
work at home as is possible. 
The pupils are required to record in notebooks, which are submitted for correction 
and criticism, the instruction received at each lesson. Throughout the course the 
work cut and planned in the class must be finished at home. Pupils are also required 
to show a satisfactory knowledge of the elementary work before undertaking the 
more advanced, and examinations are held at intervals during the course. 
In the second term the drafting and fitting of waists are taught. Much time is 
given to practice in taking accurate measurements as the basis of success in fitting 
garments. Home practice in drafting is required. One waist of plain material is 
completed, and one of striped or plaid material is cut and fitted. 
The making of house and evening dresses which embody artistic lines and harmony 
in coloring is taught in the third term. A princess dress and an evening dress are 
completed by each student. 
Instruction in drafting a child’s dress, and in the drafting, fitting, and making of 
jackets, affording a knowledge of tailor finish as applied to ladies’ coats and gowns, 
completes the dressmaking course, and covers the fourth term. 
Drawing.—A parallel course in drawing, under the direction of the art department, 
forms a part of the dressmaking course. All students in day classes are required to 
complete the course in drawing as well as that in practical dressmaking. 
No previous training in drawing is required, and though the student may not 
become technically skillful, the course cultivates the taste, and is found most help- 
ful and suggestive in home decoration, as well as in the selection of wearing apparel. 
The course is designed to train the eye and hand, and to give to the student the 
ability to see objects in their true proportions, and to express them in simple light 
and shade, in pencil, and in water color. All work is done, except in specified cases, 
from the object. Some time is given to the study of the human form in outline, to 
the character of different textures, to historic costume, and to designing hats and 
“gowns. Practice at home is required between the lessons. 
The classes are held in a room especially equipped for the purpose with models, 
casts of ornament and of the figure, photographs of famous statues and paintings, 
and colored plates of historic costume. 
The course covers four terms, and includes»pencil sketching, the appearance of 
objects, simple ornament in outline, the study of drapery in pencil and in color, the 
drawing of gowns, study of the human form in outline, sketches in water color, and 
the designing of gowns. 
The course in drawing and costume design may be undertaken apart from the 
courses in dressmaking and millinery, provided the applicant can give evidence of a 
practical knowledge of either subject. The following is the course of study: 
Instruction in the choice of materials; study of color and textiles applied to dress;

tember, and completes in nine months the full course in dressmaking. It has been 
arranged for those who can devote their whole time to the study. The class meets 
, except Saturday, from 9 to 1 o’clock, and from 2 to 5 in the afternoon. 
Two afternoons each week are given to the course in drawing, and all students 
attend the lectures given once a week by the director of the department of fine arts 
upon the history of art. These lectures are fully illustrated by lantern slides. Lec- 
tures upon hygienic, artistic, and historic dress are given by the best authorities, 
Instruction in ‘physical culture and in the methods of keeping accounts and making 
out bills is given by trained specialists. The literature of hygienic and artistic 
costume is brought to the notice of the pupils, and it is expected that they will 
inake uso of the valuable books contained in the library of the institute. 
This class is a satisfactory one for those who wish to become dressmakers, since 
they have an opportunity to make dresses for others in order to gain experience, and 
are thereby able to defray part of their expenses. 
Applicants must be at least 18 years of age, must have a knowledge of making 
dresses from pattern, must bring for inspection a dress.which in its finish proves 
their ability to do good work, and must pass a written examination on the making 
of a simple dress. 
      
MILLINERY. 
Tho object of this course is to give a thorough training in the practical, scientific, 
and artistic principles of millinery in order to prepare the student to make head 
coverings according to the best methods, and to cultivate the taste of the student 
in color and design, as related to costume. The first part of the course is valuable 
in developing lightness of touch in the making of bows and trimmings which are 
used in dressmaking as well as in millinery. 
In this branch of the department the full course comprises four terms of three 
months each with two lessons a week. 
The sessions are three hours and a half in length, two hours being devoted to prac- 
tical work, and one hour and a half to free-hand drawing and design. Applicants 
must be over 18 years of age, and able to do neat hand sewing. ‘They must also 
pass an examination in simple fractions. 
Pupils are required to record in notebooks the instructions received at each lesson. 
These are submitted for correction and criticism. 
Instruction is given during the course on the suitability of materials, combination 
of colors, and character of lines and form as essential to artistic millinery. In the 
class rooms there are cases containing hats of choice materials, selected with care, 
and used as models to educate the eye of the pupil; also a collection of examples of 
the various materials used in millinery, and photographs and colored plates illustrat- 
ing the history of costume. 
The first term of the course consists of instruction in the methods of making the 
various facings and edges used on hats, and in trimming with suitable bows. This 
forms the basis of all subse: quent work, and is therefore most important. 
Materials used for this practice work are colored cotton flannel to represent velvet, 
and harmonizing shades of sateen cut and used as ribbon. In order to apply the 
principles learned in practice work, time is given to making and trimming a hat of 
choice materials selected by the pupil. 
In the second term the method of making plain covered hats and various kinds of 
bonnets is taught, and also the making of mourning hats and bonnets of silk and 
erape. 
During the third and fourth terms the pupils work in choice materials to gain con- 
fidence and experience, each pupil making three or more hats for herself and friends, 
suited in style and materials to the season. The work of the two seasons differs 50 
materially that it is absolutely necessary that the student have experience in both 
before a certificate gan be granted 
As a help toward original work, pupils are required throughout the course to 
make hats and bonnets at home, aha to submit them for criticism. Pupils are also 
required to record in notebooks ‘the instruction received at each lesson. These are 
submitted for correction. 
Drawing.—The parallel course in drawing, under the direction of the art depart- 
ment, is an essential part of the course in millinery, and all students in day classes 
are required to complete the course in drawing as well as that in millinery. Its aim 
is to train the eye and hand, thus enabling pupils to apply the laws of design to 
millinery, and to sketch their own designs. ‘ 
The course includes pencil practice, the appearance of cylindrical objects, simple 
ornament in outline, and the study of bows and drapery; drawing of trimmed hats 
and bonnets, and practice in the use of water color, sketches in water color, study 
of the head in outline, and designs for hats. Practice at home is required between 
the lessons. The following is the course of study: Study of form, line, color, and 
texture as applied to millinery; talks on the growth and manufacture of materials

used; lessons upon the care and renovation of materials; instruction upon the dif- 
ferent facings and finishes used upon brims of hats and bonnets; practice in making 
varieties of “bows, and in trimming hats of various shapes; designing, drafting, and 
making hat and bonnet frames for heads of different proportions; some of the: prin- 
ciples applied in trimming a hat of choice materials; making and trimming covered 
hats and bonnets, also mourning bonnets of crape and of silk. Winter season: Mak- 
ing draped toque, evening bonnet, street bonnet, and velvet hat. Spring season: 
Making hat of fancy straw braid over frame, also lace bonnet and shirred hat. 
Drawing: Pencil practice, appearance of objects. Ornament from casts: Drapery, 
bows, hats; outline and proportion of the head; practice in the use of water color; 
sketches in water color of drapery and hats; study of historic costume; designing 
hats and bonnets. 
Special course.—(Five days each week—six months.) ‘This class, completing in six 
months the full course described above, is organized in September, and has been 
arranged for those who can devote their ‘whole time to the study, as well as for those 
who wish to become milliners. 
Tho class meets daily, except Saturday, from 9 to 1 o’clock and from 2 to 5 o’clock. 
Two afternoons each week are devoted to the course in drawing, and all students 
attend the lectures given by the director of the department of fine arts upon the 
history of art. These lectures are fully illustrated by lantern slides. 
Teetures upon hygienic, artistic, and historic dress are given by the best 
authorities. 
Instruction in physical culture and in the methods of keeping accounts and mak- 
ing out bills is given by trained specialists. The literature of hygienic and artistic 
costume is brought to the notice of the pupils, and they are expected to inform 
themselves upon these subjects, making use of the library of the institute. 
Applicants must pass an examination in hand sewing and in simple fractions, and 
must also submit for inspection a hat which has been made by themselves, and which 
shows their ability to undertake the course.

The Drexel Institute was founded by the late Anthony J. Drexel, in 1891, for the 
promotion of education in art, science, and industry. The chief object of the insti- 
tute is the extension and improv ement of scientific, industrial, artistic, and com- 
mercial education, as a means of opening better and Wider avenues of employ ment 
to young men and. young women. 
The institute, as at present cor 
each department is organized with reference to its special objects and cour:    
  stituted, comprises eleven departments. While 
es of 
instruction, it sustains import: ant relations to the other departments, and the various 
lines of work are carried on in so broad a spirit as to give a certain unity of purpose 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
    1120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
to the scope and ends of the institution as a whole. The organization of the several 
departments is as follows: (1) Department of fine and applied art; (2) department 
of mechanic arts; (3) department of science and technology; (4) department of 
commerce and finance; (5) department of domestic science and arts; (6) department 
of physical training; (7) normal department for the training of special teachers; 
(8) department of evening classes; (9) department of free public lectures and 
concerts; (10) library department; (11) museum department. 
DEPARTMENT OF MECHANIC ARTS. 
The department of mechanic arts provides a thorough course of instruction and 
training in mathematics, science, drawing, and shopwork, in connection with the 
essential English branches of a secondary education. 
While the education given is intended to prepare for business or industrial pur- 
suits, it seeks to develop and cultivate those qualities of mind and character that 
are of most value in the conduct of life. The object at every stage is to give the 
student the power to think and act for himself—the practical ability that is the best 
result of school training. 
The whole course of instruction is so broad and yet so practical that the graduate 
can not fail to find some occupation for which his taste and aptitude fit him; and at 
the same time he will be prepared for such an advanced scientific or technical course 
as he may desire to pursue. 
The department of mechanic arts prepares students for admission to the téchnical 
courses in electrical engineering and machine construction, and to the course in 
architecture, in the institute.

The time of the student is about equally divided between the class-room and 
laboratory studies and the shopwork. 
The scientific instruction is given chiefly by lectures and laboratory work, the 
text-book being used only for reference and review. 
The English instruction, which is carried throughout the entire course, is thorough 
and comprehensive, and furnishes a basis of sound, liberal culture for all the other 
studies. 
The practical instruction given in the shops affords a valuable aid to the scientific 
studies. It brings the student into direct and intimate relation with natural forces, 
where a practical application of these studies is required. While no attempt is, 
made to teach the student a trade, yet a good knowledge is imparted of the tech- 
nical apparatus involved in the mechanic arts, this knowledge being indispensable 
in the work of the mechanical or electrical engineer, in order that his designs may 
be practicable and of economical construction. 
Visits are made by the students, accompanied by the professors, from time to time 
to the chief industrial establishments of the city and neighborhood. 
A diploma is granted to students who complete the course and pass all the required 
examinations. 
Special courses can be arranged to suit the individual needs of students who are 
fitted to pursue them advantageously.    
   
            
    LABORATORIES AND WORKSHOPS. 
The cherical and physical laboratories are large, well lighted, well ventilated 
rooms, and are supplied with extensive collections of apparatus and with every 
appliance for the work done by the students. 
The technical shops for woodwork, bench work, machine work, and forging are 
unsurpassed in the completeness and perfection of their appointments. A small 
Corliss engine, which is placed in the machine shops, supplies the power to all the 
shops and is used also for the instruction in steam engineering. 
There are two electrical laboratories, besides smaller rooms devoted to eiectrical. 
work. The engineering laboratory is a finely appointed room and is provided with 
a 40-horsepower Porter-Allen engine, a 40-horsepower Armington-Sims marine engine, 
dynamos of the most recent design, storage batteries, and all the necessary appa- 
ratus and appliances for practical instruction in electrical science and its applica- 
tions. The smaller laboratories are situated in the annex and are well equipped 
with apparatus and conveniences for the study of theoretical electricity. 
The extensive mechanical and electrical plant of the institute building is also 
made available in the technical instruction.

figure; draperies, dresses, gowns, and coats, in monochrome and color. One lesson, 
of one hour, is given each. week. 
Tn the second term of each year instruction is also provided in accounts, business 
forms, and correspondence. One lesson, of one hour, each week. 
Courses of lectures in the chemistry of dyeing and cleansing and in physiology 
and hygiene with reference to dress are given during the second term of each year. 
These lectures are made as nontechnical as possible, with a view to interesting the 
students and furnishing them with knowledge that can be made practically available,     
  
     
   
    
      II. Special course. 
This course is arranged to meet the needs of those who wish to accomplish the 
work of the regular course in one year, and who desire additional practice in execut- 
ing orders which they may take on their own account during the second half of 
the year.

COURSES IN MILLINERY. 
The following courses in millinery are offered: I. Regular course. II. Special 
course. III. Normal course in domestic arts. IV. Evening classes. 
I, The regular course. 
The regular course in millinery consists of three systematic grades, each occupying 
one term. Each grade is complete in itself, but the three grades are essential to 
thorough training in the practice of the art. In each grade two lessons in millinery, 
of two hours each, are given weekly. 
First grade.—In this grade the work is begun with the study of the hat in detail. 
The methods of preparing the various fittings for the brim are taught upon a straw 
and a felt hat, cotton flannel and cheese cloth being used, which represent, respec- 
tively, velvet and crape. The hat is then trimmed with suitable bows of sateen to 
represent ribbon. Harmony of color is carefully studied in all this preliminary 
work. One hat is made of choice materials. 
Second grade.—The study of the bonnet and the toque, using for practice the mate- 
rials appropriate to the same. The latter part of the grade work is devoted to the 
making of bonnets and toques of choice materials. 
Third grade.—Vhroughout this grade students work in choice materials to gain con- 
fidence and experience; they are allowed to receive and execute orders.   
  
GRADUATE WORK. 
Students who have finished the three grades of the regular course may remain an 
additional term for the purpose of doing more original work and gaining additional 
practice in dealing with the designs and materials appropriate to the two millinery 
seasons. The work may consist largely of orders taken by the students.   
Il. Special course. 
The special course differs from the regular course only in completing the work of 
the three grades in one year. It is intended especially for those intending to become 
practical milliners, and who desire additional practice in executing orders, which 
may be taken by students on their own account during the second term.

JUNIOR AND ELECTIVE COURSES IN DOMESTIC SCIENCE AND ARTS. 
Coursrs oF INSTRUCTION. 
  The following courses are offered: I. Junior course. II. Elective courses. 
I. Junior course.—The junior course is a nonprofessional course of prescribed 
studies and is designed: (1) To supply that training for the duties and responsibili- 
ties of home life which the ordinary academic education fails to give; (2) to lay a 
broad and solid foundation for the technical work involved in the direct preparation 
for a profession or trade. The course of instruction covers two yea: 
This course is based upon the recognition of the fact that the training for the prac- 
tical business of life should have its due place in the education of the individual 
during the plastic period of life. Experience is constantly showing the soundness 
of this position. 
Of the classes that have thus far been graduated, more than three-fourths of the 
pupils have developed aptitudes for one or another of the arts and sciences, and are 
now taking advanced courses in chemistry, biology, domestic science, millinery, or 
dressmaking, with a view, in each case, to following the pursuit as a profession. 
As a resvlt of this preparatory training ina well-arranged and soundly correlated 
course of study, these pupils have the advantage of entering upon the pursuit of 
their technical courses with good habits of thought and study, and with the ability 
to take an intelligent delight in their work.       
   
-P-A-G-E-169
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1127 
The course is divided broadly into scientific work, academic work, and industrial 
work—about one-third of the time being given to each, 
The list of studies is as follows: 
FIRST YEAR. 
First term.—Sewing, millinery, cookery, household economics, mathematics, draw- 
ing, history, current topics, English and American literature, rhetoric and composi- 
tion, physical training. 
Second ter m.—Sewing, millinery, cookery, household economics, mathematics, 
drawing, history, current topics, English and American literature, rhetoric and

chemistry, physiology and hygiene, laundry work, drawing applied to dress and 
ornament, English ‘Jiterature, rhetoric and composition, current topics, business 
forms and accounts, physical training. 
Il. Elective courses.—The elective courses are intended only for advanced students 
who are qualified to make a choice of studies for specialization. ‘These courses are 
designed for youngewomen who desire a course of training in the sciences or arts, 
combining with such training, when necessary, courses in the academic branches. 
Students may elect a single study or a “group course” from the several courses 
offered below. 
The institute affords superior advantages for students who wish to specialize. 
The following courses are offered: (1) Mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, 
physical training; (2) cookery, millinery, dressmaking, household economy, chem- 
istry of foods, laundry work; (3) free-hand drawing, drawing from the antique, 
mechanical drawing, painting” in oil and water color; (4) rhetoric and composition, 
English and American literature, history of art, civics and economies. 
  A@TENDANCE. 
In the regular prescribed courses, attendance five days a week, and, upon an average, 
five hours a day is required. Work begins at 9 a. m. and continues to such hours (up 
to 4 o’clock) as the programme of studies demands. 
FE 
  Regular course, $30 per term. Advanced elective courses, according to the group 
of subjects chosen. The cost of the materials used in the science and the cookery 
classes is included in the fee. 
All the materials used in the dressmaking and millinery classes and all text-books 
and stationery are supplied by the student, 
SUBJECTS OF I 
  STRUCTION. 
The following outlines furnish more detailed information concerning some of the 
subjects of instruction embraced in the junior course and the elective courses 
Cookery.—A thorough course in all the ordinary processes of cookery, with indi- 
vidual practice during each lesson. Each pupil performs the whole of the process 
treated in the lesson and produces a complete dish from a given recipe. Of the four 
hours per week, three are given to practice and one to theory. The theoretical part 
considers, in an elementary way, the chemical properties and constituents of foods 
and their nutritive value, 
Millinery.—The fundamental principles of trimming and making hats, with 
thorough practice in wiring, binding, puffing, facing (plain and shirred), covering of 
buckram frames, trimming hats in choice materials, making of shirred hats. The 
course fits the pupil to do thoroughly all her home millinery and forms a solid basis 
for a professional course. 
; Sewing and dressmaking.—Practice in sewing various materials used in making a 
dress. 
Cutting, drafting, fitting, and making plain dresses, waists, etc. The course fits 
the pupil to do all ‘ther home dressmaking and forms a solid basis for a professional 
course. 
The incidental instruction in millinery and dressmaking includes the principles of 
hygienic dressing and the consideration of form and color as applied to dress, 
Laundry work.—During the last term of the senior year practical instruction is 
given in washing and ironing in the scientific laundry of the institute. The stu- 
dents pore make important applications of the facts of chemistry in regard to the

removal of stains, the preservation of texture and color, and the use and constituents 
of soaps, washing fluids, bleaching powders, and starches. 
Houschold and social economy.—This term covers broadly the instruction in the 
various subjects that relate to the growth and well-being of the household and of 
organized society. The instruction is given (1) incidentally as opportunity occurs 
in the course of the daily work, and (2) in a series of lectures and lessons system- 
atically arranged with a view to correlating kindred subjects in their bearing upon 
the household and upon social life and organization. 
The following general outline indicates the scope of the work. It will be noted 
that every part of the work capable of demonstration has its outcome in actual 
laboratory work. 
The home.—Evolution of the home; significance in the social economy; relation to 
the individual, to the community. Administration of the home. Relation of income 
to expenditure; the commonsense of economy; the vulgarity of extravagance. The 
executive functions of the housekeeper. The question of domestic service.

  SPRING GARDEN INSTITUTE, PHILADELPHIA, Pa. 
[Statement of Addison B. Burk, president. ] 
The institute has three departments: Art, mechanical handiwork, and electrical 
departments. The art school is educational in its aim, and prepares some pupils for 
higher studies and others for work as designers. The mechanical school is strictly a 
workshop school, the pupils working eight hours a day.. There is no intention to 
teach a particular trade, but in the course of their training the metal, workers 
become machinists, and the woodworkers pattern makers. ‘They have, however, 
general knowledge of various other trades, and are fitted to become learners in any 
of them. They have also a good foundation upon which to pursue higher studies. 
In the electrical department laboratory instruction is given as well as practical 
work in wiring, winding dynamos, etc., so that the pupils may become linemen, 
makers of electrical apparatus, or electrical engineers. , 
The institute is independent of other institutions, and is maintained by fees of 
pupils and interest on its endowment fund. The fees of pupils range from $40 to 
$75 for the day classes, and from $5 to $15 for the night classes, the bulk of the pupils 
paying $40 in the day classes and $5 at night. The higher charges are for electricity. 
The unique feature of our work is the maintenance of workshop schools, with no 
theoretical studies and work at the bench for eight hours a day. 
The shops are fully equipped with hand and machine tools. The pupils are fur, 
nished with all tools and materials that may be required.

The value of the plant exclusive of buildings is probably $25,000. The annual 
expense of maintenance is probably $1,000. 
The result of our system is that boys become highly skilled mechanics (without 
commercial speed) in the course of two years. They become so intelligent (without 
being taught to do anything but work) that they readily acquire theoretical knowl- 
edge by the reading of books. Our aim is that of Stephen Girard, to teach them 
things, not words, and let them pick up the words afterwards. 
  WoRrKINGMAN’S SCHOOL, NEW York Ciry. 
[Statement of Maximilian P. E. Groszmann, director.] 
  Our school is in no way connected with the public schools, and receives no State 
aid. It is supported by the United Relief Works of the Society for Ethical Culture, 
a fund of voluntary subscriptions. We have about 400 pupils in our schools, three- 
fourths of whom enjoy free tuition. The tuition for the others is.$75 in the kinder- 
garten and $125 to $150 and $200 in the school classes a year. 
The Workingman’s School aims to be a model public school and to serve as an 
experimental field in which new methods of education, as they arise, may be tried 
for the benefit of the entire public-school system. This is the function which it 
aspires to fulfill, It hopes to remain in constant touch with the public schools, to 
work with them and for them, and for their advantage to try new educational ideas, 
such as can be tested under more free and favorable conditions by an institution out- 
side of the system than by one that forms a part of it. 
Manual training is one of the special features of the school. Manual training has 
been introduced into the high-school course of several of the public schools of the 
country with the expectation that it will work its way downward into the lower 
grades. To us, the opposite way of proceeding seems far more logical. The plan 
of education should develop from below upward, like a tree, unfolding its several 
branches more and more as it rises in height, and thus maturing toward perfect frui- 
tion at the top. 
The school, howeyer, is in no sense a trade school for the education of artisans, 
nor merely a manual-training school. It is a complete day school in which manual 
training is utilized solely on account of its educational value. 
The equipment consists of one 6-horsepower steam engine, 1 engine lathe, 6 speed 
lathes, 6 sets soldering tools, 6 sets carpenter tools, 10 sets carpenter tools, 10 sets 
metal-working tools, 20 sets mechanical drawing tools, 4 sets forge tools. The pupils 
are provided with all the tools. 
The cost of equipment is about $3,000, and the annual expense for material and 
supplies about $200. 
It is difficnlt to determine the effects of manual training upon the length of school 
life. It is true that our children, even those who are the children of the working 
classes, remain with us longer than is usnal, but whether this is due to the effect of 
manual training only or to the general spirit of the school can not be ascertained. 
There are a number of our pupils who have taken up a technical course after 
graduation. 
       
COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. 
The course of instruction comprises in all classes: Elementary natural science 
(object lessons), geography, geometry (form lessons), construction (manual work), 
mechanical drawing, free-hand drawing, designing, modeling in clay, reading (litera- 
ture), composition, language and spelling, German, writing, arithmetic, history, 
ethics, vocal music, gymnastics.. In the three highest grades algebra is tanght in 
connection with arithmetic and geometry. Latin has been introduced in the two 
highest classes. Coeducation of the sexes in the same class room and studies is the 
rule; from the third grade up, however, the boys receive their instruction in manual 
work in the workshop, the girls being taught in the sewing room; and in some of 
the lessons in gymnastics the.exercises of the boys and girls are conducted in sepa- 
rate classes.

  Stoyp TRAINING ScHooL, Boston, Mass. 
[From a circular of the school, 1895.] 
This school was established by Mrs. Quincy A. Shaw in 1888, It represents private 
experimental work in the intere: st of education, and offers free instruction to teachers 
in the hope of giving them such acquaintance with the subject of manual training 
as will tend to an understanding of the pedagogical basis of the work, as well as to 
give thorough instruction in mechanical drawing and woodwork. 
Heretofore the work of the Sloyd Training School has been confined to the prepa- 
ration of teachers for grammar-grade pupils. The superior facilities of the new 
location of the school not only afford better opportunities for the training of teach- 
ers, but make possible the introduction of a course of work for high schools based 
on the educational principles charactéristic of sloyd. The recent “act of the Mas- 
sachusetts legislature regarding manual training in high schools and the demand for 
thoroughly equipped teachers make more than ever apparent the need for this work. 
The Sloyd Training School now occupies nearly the entire upper floor of the North

Bennet Street Industrial School. Two large, well-lighted and well-ventilated 
rooms, thoroughly equipped, are devoted to the normal classes, 
Another room accommodates classes of children, giving to normal students ample 
opportunity for observation and practice of teaching. 
‘The commodious office contains a careful selection of books for the use of students, 
and also complete and graphic illustrations of various manual-training courses. 
    COURSE OF STUDY. 
Daily lectures on the educational principles of manual training, including reasons 
for and explanation of the exercises and their progression, and also the application 
of gymnastic principles to movements and positions in working. 
Lectures on: The nature and development of the child as the guide to that which 
the teacher must provide; history and growth of manual training; the great edu- 
cators, as Comenius, Rousseau, Froebel, “Cygneus; the use, construction, and care 
of tools; woods, their growth, qualities, and structure; suitable sloyd room, proper 
outfit, prices, ete. 
A course of lectures on psychology is also given by a recognized authority. 
Students are required to produce weekly abstracts from the lectures, and also 
papers showing their ability to demonstrate the educational value of the work. 
  REQUIRED TECHNICAL WORK. 
The satisfactory completion of 31 models, including the making of 15 different 
joints and involving the use of 47 tools. The course represents 72 different exercises. 
Working drawings of each model, full size and to scale. 
Simple projections and geometrical problems. 
The sharpening of every tool used in the course. 
Recognition and selection of the proper material for cach model. 
Oiling, shellacking, and polishing. 
Selection and preparatiou of specimens of various woods. 
Working ont in wood, steps showing the progression of exercises in the first six 
models. 
Invention of a sloyd model involving certain exercises. This model to be the 
property of the school. 
Estimate of proper wood and outfit for a given number of pupils. 
Criticising and marking the finished work is an important feature of the course. 
Two of the teachers and two or more students examine each model and pass judg- 
ment upon it before it receives the mark of the school. 2 
The high-school course will include wood turning, wood carving, and advanced 
drawing, besides more practice with tools than is given in the grammar-school course, 
and on a different set of models. 
In addition to the above, the following are required: Observation of children at 
work as a basis for child study; teaching of individuals and classes; a thesis on a 
given subject concerning educational manual training. 
Twenty-five hours a week for eight months must be given to the study of the 
theory and practice of educational manual training. 
A working drawing must be made previous to “the making of each model. The 
drawing to ‘De handed i in, with the complete woodwork, for approv al. 
Models must be made in the given sequence. 
Notes must be taken of the “ talks” given in class, and students will be required 
to read such notes in class when called upon. 
Each student will be required to keep his tools sharp. The use of dull tools will 
not be permitted. 
The use of file or sandpaper will not be allowed until the work is as well done as 
possible with the edge tool, and is accepted by the teacher. 
Students must select lumber and submit it to the class teacher for inspection before 
using. 
Models made out of school hours will not be accepted. 
The benches and tools must be left in perfect order, also the pigeonholes and lumber 
on the shelves. 
Admission to the high-school course will be granted only to men who give evidence 
of special fitness and to graduates of the Sloyd Training School. 
Students are received on probation. Those showing little aptitude for the work 
will be advised to discontinue the course. 
Students will be expected to follow a special course of reading, and are advised to 
obtain the following books:

The 1 inaking of the models and drawings alone is not considered by the Sloyd Train- 
ing School a “sufficient preparation for teaching gsloyd. The educational bearings of 
the subject should be studied thoroughly in connection with the bench work, pand 
for this reason: The regular diploma and the badge of the Sloyd Training School 
will be given to students who satisfactorily complete the whole course of study, 
giv ing continuous d. attendance during the school year. 
Special classes are formed for those who are engaged in teaching. 
A special certificate will be given to members of weekly classes. 
SLOYD FOR AMERICAN SCHOOLS. 
[By Gustaf Larsson, principal. ] 
The course for grammar schools in tool work and drawing here submitted is one 
which is adapted to the teaching of classes in elementary sckools. It includes the 
making of 15 different joints and involves the use of 47 tools. The course repre- 
sents 72 different exercises. * * * 
Sloyd is not the outgrowth of a single mind, or of the experiments at one time 
or place, but the result of the work of wise investigators and practical teachers 
in many countries. Based, as is the kindergarten, on the philosophy of Froebel 
and Pestalozzi, sloyd aims primarily, by its appeal to many activities, to make 
the boy, and not the wooden model., This system was originally planned after 
the Swedish sloyd as taught under the direction of Herr Otto Salomon, who has 
devoted a lifetime of faithful study to this subject at N at which place educators 
from all parts of the world have contributed their thought, Asa result of actnal 
experience in Boston, since 1888, with classes of boys, it has now been carefully 
adapted to the needs of American children. _The drawing as an integral part of 
sloyd work is a conspicuous American gain, * * * 
AIM or SLoyp. 
  The harmonious development of the pupil, during the formative age, giving him 
by inanual exercises and the use of the creative instinct such general training as 
will tend to fit him, mentally, morally, and physically for any subsequent special 
training. 
Sloyd is not limited to work in wood. Clay, cardboard, and iron, if adapted to 
the physical and mental requirements of the pupils, may serve as sloyd materials.    
  
CONDITIONS AND MEANS. 
In pursuance of its aim, sloyd insists upon the necessity for: 
(1) Properly located, well-ventilated and well-lighted workrooms, with sufficient 
space for freedom of movement for each pupil. 
(2) Adjustable benches which are so constructed that they can be adjusted at any 
lesson. 
(3) The maintenance of gymnastically correct positions in the performance of all 
kinds of work. 
(4) The exclusion of all kinds of tools and forms of work tending to retard growth, 
to injure or malform the body. 
(5) Giving prominence to the use of such tools as require the exercise of both sides 
of the body equally, and to those which require strong muscular effort. 
TOOLs. 
Since the chief object of this training is the evolution of forces, not the acquisi- 
tion of skill, as such, a_great variety of tools are provided, calling constantly for 
new effort in gaining control. In fact, sloyd employs more tools, more exercises, and 
requires greater variety of manipulations than any other course of manual training 
yet presented for schools. 
To insure careful thonght, the more mechanical contrivances are avoided and hand 
tools requiring a higher degree of muscular control are employed. Right under- 
standing of a tool and a certain degree of control resulting from using if are what 
the worker is intended to gain, not such mastery of any oye tool that using it    
   
-P-A-G-E-175
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. tds 
requires 2 minimtm amount of effort. This is one of the differences between indus- 
trial and educational manual training. Yet even if technical skill were the only 
object in view, the sloyd method would be found far more successful as a means of 
securing it than abstract exercises and long practice with a limited number of tools. 
The manner of using tools in sloyd haying reference always to the physical and 
mental need of the worker will increase his ability to handle skillfully and success- 
fully the instruments of any occupation or profession, because it gives him control 
of himself. .A surgeon, a lawyer, a clergyman, a chemist should be as much indebted 
to.sloyd for the gain of power as the cabinetmaker or carpenter. No peculiar 
methods, however, are used which followers of the latter occupations would have 
to unlearn, 
It is of utmost importance that the first impression of the purpose and method of 
using a tool should he correct and effective. 
In using any tool the results produced by it, in the wood, should be tested at every 
step, in order that the purpose for which the tool is used may he fulfilled.   
EXERCISES. 
An ‘‘exercise” in sloyd is the specific use of a tool involving ceriain mental and 
physical effort. 
The progression of exercises follows carefully the increase of power in the child. 
The models are based on the exercises. 
MOopELs. 
(1) Models should be simple but pleasing in appearance. Form and proportions 
should be as far as practicable such as a true artist would approve. 
(2) The models should be serviceable articles for home use, suited to local require- 
ments. 
(3) The exercises in each model should be so related to the previous steps that they 
“constitute a gymnastic exercise of the attention and the will, never an exhausting 
labor.” ! 
Nove.—It has been found that, as a general rule, a suitable progression does not 
allow more than four nor less than one ney ercise in a model. 
(4) The finished article should be a truthful expression of the amount of effort or 
skill the child has exercised in making it. f 
(5) A large proportion of the models should involve such exercises as will require 
testing by the unaided eye and the sense of touch. 
The principles previously stated have been so carefully followed in arranging the 
course here illustrated, and the course has been so well tested by experience that 
it is presented with great confidence for the training of children from 12 to 15 years 
of age; but it is not considered in any particular as a finality. Better means are 
constantly sought and suggestions leading to improvement most cordially welcomed. 
It will be seen that the value of a course of sloyd models should only be tested by 
considering their fidelity to the fundamental principles, and that changes of models 
should be made with re, It is also evident that while no one series of mod- 
els need be arbitrarily used, all adaptations which conform to the same principles 
will possess strong points of resemblance. So long as the completed object forms 
the basis of judgment, there will be as many systems as there are persons to make new models, and the educational value of manual training will suffer. Not until 
the motive and the significance of the progression of exercises is understood can the 
value “of any system of work be estimated. Thorough investigation of manual 
training courses is urged upon those who are concerned in the introduction of the 
subject into schools or reformatories. Such investigation will show that this is not 
a matter of mere theory, but, in the words of a prominent reformatory officer who 
has seen the work of sloyd for several years, that ‘‘The moral improvement of the 
individual is as clear and indubitable as his advance in skill.” 
     
            
      
DRAwIinea. 
‘The making of the working drawing, which is a concise means of thought expres- 
sion, should precede the making of each model. The drawing would be tanght to 
greatest advantage in the regular schoolroom by the class teacher or the drawing 
teacher, who should he supplied by the sloyd teacher with models and directions 
about the drawing. New lite would be given to the drawing, for the pupils would be 
eager to understand and draw the objects to be made in the sloyd room, a great gain 
on the blind copying of processes which is now carried on in so many schools. —

1134 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96, 
The connection of sloyd with the regular school work in this way would lead to a 
better appreciation of its value by teacher and parents and to greater interest in the 
drawing on the part of the pupi 
In introducing mechanical drawing into schools, independent of sloyd, objects can 
be selected from the sloyd models and these rules followed: 
(1) The pupil should be led to see that drawing is a convenient and forcible means 
of thought expression. 
(2) In teaching orthographic projection the third angle is employed ; that is to say, 
the object is placed below the horizontal plane and behind the vertical plane. 
(3) Pupils should be taught to read understandingly any simple working drawing. 
(4) A working drawing should contain only such views, lines, and dimensions as 
are actually nece: y to a clear comprehension of the object to be made. 
(6) The objects used should present such a combination of principles as will afford 
variety, and also sufficient repetition to impress them upon the pupil’s mind, 
(6) As arule, no object should contain more than four new facts. 
(7) All the objects should be made to exact dimensions. 
(8) The inspiration which comes from the uso of the creative instinct is as useful 
in drawing as in other lessons, and therefore, even when drawings are to be made 
independently of tool work, they should represent, as far as possible, objects of use.   
        TE. 
It is difficult to say just how many sloyd exercises can be exeented in a given 
time, for, as has been stated, the work is based on growth, and this varies in differ- 
ent individua however, from observation and experience the following course 
shows approximately what can be accomplished in three years (forty school weeks in 
a year), giving two hours per week to the work. 
This course might be taken in one year, if six hours a week (three two-hour 
lessons) were allotted to the subject.   
3      
Whenever this time has been given to sloyd, under a thorongh teacher, improyement in the chool studies has been marked.    ELE 
  rARY SLOYD. 
The demand for manual work for children younge: than those provided for by the 
sloyd courso has led to various attempts to meet this want. 
The danger of exacting from young children work which requires constant repe- 
tition of fine precise movements has been so plainly pointed out by physiolog: 
that in the following course there has been constant endeayor to provide for ex 
cising the larger groups of muscles. But this work is still experimental, and it must 
be clearly understood that it is not so confidently recommended as was the previous 
course. 
Elementary sloyd is a course of work in two dimensions of the wood, requiring, in 
most cases, but one view in drawing. 
A special room, fitted with suitable benches, is necessary for this work. But the 
outfit is not so expensive as the regular sloyd, the tools being fewer and smaller. 
~The knife isnot used in this course. The objects are suited to the age of the children 
(9 to 12 years), and the exercises aro very simple. Elementary sloyd is considered a 
valuable training by the teachers, who have observed its results in the children. 
Before attempting to teach this course it is important that the regular sloyd course 
be completed in order that the principles of the work be understood and sufficient 
mastery of tools acquired. 
Special attention should be paid to the selection of tools for elementary sloyd. 
There must be suitable benches, with proper vises. The splitting saw should be 14 
inches long, with 12 teeth to an inch; turning saw 8 inches long, one-eighth inch 
blade, 15 teeth to an inch; smoothing plane 8 inches; center bit well adjusted and 
sharpened, etc.     
    Wuirriine Course. 
Many earnest teachers, particularly in the smaller towns, fee] the need of manual 
training in their schools, but are unable to secure it on account of the expense 
involved. 
A special teacher and sloyd outfit being out of the question, a course of woodwork 
that can be given in the schoolroom by the regular teacher, and requiring but few 
implements, has been planned for such cases. 
With simply a desk board, sketchbook, pencil, rule, compasses, try-square, knife, 
and sandpaper block (all costing about $1) for each pupil, the course here outlined 
can be executed. 
The exercises are chiefly whittling, but are planned to give as great variety of 
thonghtand movement as possible. ‘The exercises involve drawing, lining, measuring, 
testing with rule, try-square, etc. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  
MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1135 
While I would not recommend a course of woodwork requiring the use of one 
cutting tool only, if a fuller outfit were possible, yet I feel sure that the development 
which will be gained by such a course as this is far better than having no manual 
training in the school. 
A sharp distinction must be made between cutting wood with the point of the 
knife, ‘knife work” (so called), and whittling. 
The former is done in a bending or sitting position and with a cramped muscular 
movement. Though a great variety of forms may be cut in this way, there is not 
sufficient stimulus to new thought after cutting the first pieces, the muscular action 
being nearly the same in all cases, 
Whittling, on the other hand, is done in a good, standing position, with free 
muscular movements. New thought is constantly required in making the various 
articles which are carefully selected with reference to awakening and holding the 
jnterested attention of the worker. 
The pupil should in most cases express his thought of the model in a correct 
working drawing before making each model (such a drawing to include but one 
view of the object). 
Thus drawing becomes of more consequence to the pupil as he realizes that the 
eare and accuracy with which he measures dimensions and makes his drawing go 
far to determine the excellence of his model. 
The pupil should also have practice in reading working drawings from the black- 
board. 
No teacher who has not herself satisfactorily completed both the drawing and the 
whittling of the entire course should undertake to teach it.

  1142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
  Tur Boston NormMaL ScHoon or Cookery, BosTon, Mass.   
[From cireilar for 1895-96.} 
The Boston Normal School of Cookery was founded by the late Mrs. Mary Hemen- 
way. Itis designed to enable those who wish to become teachers of or experts in 
the theory and practice of cookery and allied subjects to obtain adequate prepara- 
tion for positions in public or private schools, medical schools, or other institutions, 
training schools for nurses, etc. 
The course of instruction has covered hitherto only one year, but experience has 
shown that this time is insufficient, and it will henceforward extend over two years. 
By this means it becomes possible to supply better laboratory facilities, more 
advanced instruction, and more thorough practical work. 
Provision has now been made for a sound elementary training in chemistry, physics, 
biology, physiology, and hygiene (in which subjects the instruction, by special 
arrangement, is given in the laboratories of the Massachusetts Institute of ‘Technol- 
ogy), as well as in the theory and practice of cookery and the cognate household arts. 
For the latter subjects, a kitchen laboratory in one of the public school buildings of 
Boston has been fitted with all necessary appliances, and placed under the super- 
vision of an expert teacher. Here are taught the manifold practical details of 
kitchen and laundry work, as well as the domestic applications of modern science. 
      THE COURSE OF STUDY. 
    First term: General chemistry, physics (elementary), the household 
arts, first principles. Second term: Chemical analysis (qualitative), biology (ele- 
mentary), cookery (theory and practice). 
Second year.—First term: Physiology and hygiene, chemical analysis (volumetric), 
bacteriology (lectures and laboratory), cookery (special practice). Second term: 
Physiology and hygiene, chemistry (sanitary), practice in teaching classes in cook- 
ery, thesis work.   
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION, 
Chemistry.—Inasmuch as cookery is based upon an application of chemistry to 
food preparing, and deals with food stuffs and their treatment by fire and water or 
by other mainly chemical methods, chemistry-has been made one of the principal 
features of the course. After a general introduction and practice in elementary 
analysis covering the entire first year, the students proceed to volumetric analysis, 
and, finally, to the careful chemical examination of air and water, as well as of milk, 
butter, bread, and other foods. Constant laboratory work accompanies the more 
formal lectures and recitations. 
General biology, physiology, bacteriology, hygiene, etc., are of equal importance 
with chemistry to the expert teacher of cookery. The income and ontgo of the 
_human body, its sources of energy, its relation to food stufis and foods as illustrated 
by digestion and indigestion, absorption, circulation, metabolism, and excretion— 
these and many kindred topics, such as food economy, shvuld be familiar to every 
teacher of cookery. The modern advances in bacteriology, which underlie a seien- 
tifie comprehension of canning, preserving, refrigeration and cold storage, 
and fermentation, sterilization or pasteurizing of milk, ete., will also hencefor 
claim a much more considerable equipment on the part of well-informed teachers of 
the household arts. 
Professional work.—The principal object of the school is the fitting of persons, ade- 
quately prepared, to become teachers of cookery and the cognate household arts. 
To this end, therefore, all the other instruction offered is tributary. Side by side 
with the more general and theoretieal training there goes throughout the course 
instruction in the theory and practice of cookery; and inthe last half year the stu- 
dents themselves become teachers, and actually apply in practice what they have 
learned. Each student is also expected to prepare a thesis embodying careful per- 
sonal study of some appointed subject relating to the professional work of the 
school. The following is a more detailed outline of the courses in cookery. 
The work is arranged on educational as well as technical lines, and affords both 
theoretical and practical iustruction, which is given in the well-equipped kitchen 
laboratory already referred to. There are four courses. 
(1) The fundamental principles of foods and cookery. The preparation of simple

and regulation of fires; the use of gas and oil with relative costs of various fuels. 
(2) The physiological relations between food and the body. Average composition 
of the body under given conditions. 
(3) Composition of food stuffs and a study of the “‘ food principles” thus afforded 
for the body. The effect of heat with objective points to aid digestion by taste, 
solution and dilution of food materials, and partial chemical change (or decomposi- 
tion). A study of the physical and chemical properties of foods with experiments

MANUAL TRAINING. 
Our manual training school has had a successful year. There has been a marked 
increase in the interest shown by the boys in their work. ‘The improvements in the 
building have been accomplished by still greater improvements in the work of 
instruction, Every effort is being made to get the best results, to give the boys that 
training which is best for hand, eye, and mind. Heretofore the metal working has 
been, to an extent, the center around which the work of the other departments has 
revolved. ‘That is to say, the work of other departments has been largely prepara- 
tory to that of the metal-working section. While this line of work will be con- 
tinued, it will not be given quite so much emphasis. We do not know what the 
future of any boy of the college will be. The jduestion for us to consider is, ‘In 
what way and by what means can we best develop the special capacities and apti- 
tudes of each boy, so that he may most easily find his proper place in life and 
become a self- dependent and self-governed man?” The new curriculum now being 
developed and applied enlarges the work of each department, gives it greater v ari 
ety and more practical worth, places all departments more or Jess on the’same level, 
and encourages the head of each to make the most of his own sphere of labor. * * 
Some friends of manual training are now advocating trade teaching. Whether 
this is better than to give mere skill of hand and knowledge of the use of tools is a
-P-A-G-E-186
    1144 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
question. In Girard College, in which the boys are all very young, I believe that 
the best results are obtained by giving the all-round training which will enable the 
Jad to employ his time to the best advantage when he leaves the college to earn his 
livelihood. From statistics it would seem that specializing has not brought the best 
returns. During the five years ending with 1894 we did some trade teaching in 
several departments, and yet the number of boys going to mechanical occupations 
on leaving school was 40 per cent less than during the previous five years when little 
or no trade teaching was attempted. These statistics may not be, and probably are 
not, conclusive. We can understand, however, that there are many boys who care 
more for manual skill than for trade skill, who are pleased with the idea of being 
taught the use of carpenters’ tools, but who lose interest at once when they suspect 
that they are to be taught the carpenter's trade. * * * 
While we would emphasize the fact that manual training is not trade teaching, we 
hold that it brings pupils a long way on toward the learning of the trades. This is 
because the instruction is based on the principles underlying the trades, not in the 
details of the trades themselves. It is the result of applying the science of educa- 
tion to the learning of trades. Asa trained mind is the best preparation for the 
study of a profession, so are the trained hand and the trained eye the best prepara- 
tion for the successful acquisition of a trade. 
We believe that the problem is now being satisfactorily solved under the wise 
action of the board, recently taken, first in restoring class teaching in place of the 
elective system, and, second, in giving to graduate pupils the privilege of taking a 
special course in any one of the departments of the mechanicai school, This will 
give manual training to all and trade instruction to such as shall desire and merit it.

COOKING, 
Since the management of a household is to be the occupation of most women, we 
endeavor so to train our pupils that this responsible office shall seem to them an 
interesting and noble one by showing them, practically, in some departments of 
work, what a vast differeace intelligence and skill. forethought and sel{-possession 
can make; as, for example, in cooking. For eighteen years women who are known 
throughout the country as skilled specialists in their work have cooked and explained 
their methods in the presence of* all the pupils. 
Miss Parloa, Mrs. Daniell, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Oakes, and Miss Barrows need but to 
be named to give assurance that the instruction has been the best to be obtained in 
this country. 
We hold that applied science can have no better uses for most girls than in scien- 
tific housekeeping—since in no technical art will a little prac 1 knowledge go 
farther to simplify what is otherwise complicated and laborious; or do more toward 
what is a chief result of all science—adding to the comfort and happiness of the 
human race. The application of chemistry and physics to daily living, and of such 
knowledge of sanitary principles and domestic economy as can be turned to practical 
use in homes by housekeepers and mothers, seems to us an essential part of girls’ 
education, and not to be neglected. Hence, for instruction in cooking we have a 
thoroughly furnished lecture room, with raised seats, and the appliances of a well- 
ordered kitchen, and we give the subject a place in the required curriculum. In 
other branches of domestic accomplishment instruction is also given. Dress cutting 
and fitting, mending, house furnishing and management, marketing, etc., receive 
eareful attention. 
The results have been well tested in homes, and numerous testimonials to practical 
efficiency from delighted mothers prove the thought and work to be no visionary 
one. Better than all is the approval of earlier pupil ring now the burden of life 
in their own homes, who thank us especially for this instruction, assuring us that it 
has helped them over many hard places in a young housekeeper’s life. 
The instruction in cooking is arranged for a course of three years—the whole free 
of cost to pupils, and attendance required of all until satisfactory acquirements have 
been made. Those who pass examinations in the first year’s work are advanced to 
the second year; those failing are conditioned, or recommitted to the first-year class, 
as seems best; from the second to the:third year pupils are passed in the same man- 
ner. The first and second year’s work is by demonstrations; that of the third year 
is done entixg}y by the pupils in the practice kitchen. 
Private cl&sses for personal work, at fixed rates, for any grades, are open to all 
pupils. ‘

DRESS CUTTING. 
An opportunity is given to learn dress cutting by the most approved method. 
The best dress cutters are always in demand, and receive high wages. Some of 
our former pupils are now earning their living by this; others doing all the work at 
home. Many a woman who fails in music or art might excel in some handicraft. 
Foolish prejudices must yield to the increasing necessities of the age. The depart- 
ment of dress needs the influence of educated women. The actual work done in this 
branch has shown its practicability. 
  MILLINERY. 
Like thorough instruction is offered in millinery ;. the pupils, if they wish, making 
their own hats or bonnets. The success in this class has been encouraging. 
MENDING. 
We do what time permits to teach those who need it, how to mend their clothing. 
The matron will give special attention to any for whom her offices are requested. 
These, like other studies, may not be suited to all; but to many they will furnish 
added elements of independence and strength for the needs of life. 
All is furnished at the lowest possible expense. It is not proposed to make money, 
but to fit our girls to be self-helpful. 
UNIVERSITY SCHOOL, CLEVELAND, Oni0.! 
[From the catalogue for 1894-95. ] 
The aim of University School is to develop the pupil symmetrically in mind and 
body, to impart to him as much as possible of useful knowledge, and to aid him 
in acquiring healthful and manly habits and in forming an earnest and upright 
character. 
dhe courses of study are arranged with the aim of fitting pupils to enter any col- 
lege or technical school, and of giving a good education to those who intend to go 
from the school immediately into business life. During the first four years the work 
is substantially the same for all pupils. For the last four years the course is so 
planned that each pupil may pursue such studies as will fit him for his future work. 
The studies are arranged in two courses, the scientific and the classical. The aim 
of the classical course is to thoroughly prepare boys for the best American colleges, 
care being taken that, without detriment to his general scholarship, each boy shall 
be fitted in every subject required by the college of his choice. 
The scientific course is designed to meet the wants of those who desire to prepare 
themselves for business or for technical schools. The special aim is a thorough 
training in the English branches. The study of some language, ancient or modern, 
is required, as essential to a proper mental development. For pupils preparing to 
enter a technical school, the work in Latin, German, and French is adapted to meet 
the requirements. 
The study of mathematics, science, English, and history forms a part of each 
course, and is regarded as essential for all. 
The work in manual training is begun in the first year with free-hand drawing, 
which is continued during the second year. In the third year this is replaced by 
clay drawing or modeling, and in the fourth year by wood carving. This is followed 
in the fifth year by mechanical drawing and wood work, in the sixth by mechanical 
drawing and metal work, and in the seventh by mechanical drawing, forging, and 
machine work. In the eighth year are introduced the study of engines, boilers, 
and other machinery, experimental work, and the visiting of manufacturing 
establishments. 
The pupils in the classical department are not required to take all of the shop work, 
but it is believed desirable for the best development that all should follow the course 
through the fifth year. Classes are so arranged that older pupils may, if they wish, 
do special work in free-hand drawing or in wood carving.    
    TYLER SCHOOL, PROVIDENCE, R. I.? 
[Statement of E. B. May, sloyd teacher.] 
The work is intended for educational purposes, and is a part of the regular school 
course, which covers the primary and lower grammar grades. The boys are obliged 
to give two hours a week to manual training.

-P-A-G-E-188
  1146 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The school is parochial, and is under the immediate supervision of the rector of 
the cathedral. It is supported by the church, there being no charge for tuition. 
The course is the Swedish sloyd, as adapted to American schools by Mr. Gustaf 
Larsson, of Boston, Mass. There are 31 models, intended to cover three years’ work. 
There are also 15 preliminary models for pupils of the lower grades. 
There are 6 classes of 8 to 16 boys, with a total of about 80. 
The average age is about 11 years. 
The method of instruction, owing to the small number in the classes, is almost 
wholly individual. 
A working drawing is first made by the pupil from a model belonging to the school, 
and from this drawing he afterwards makes a similar model. This ‘shows him the 
connection between the working drawing and the model, and also why certain lines, 
etc.—dimension lines, for instance—are necessary. 
Each pupil is allowed to advance as rapidly as he is able, not being obliged to wait 
for those slower than himself. 
The building itself is of the common style of school buildings, four stories in height, 
and contains ten class rooms and hall beside the manual-training department. 
The equipment is as follows: Nine double and two single benches, The double 
ones each have 1 common ripsaw and 1 cutting-off saw, and on each side 1 10-inch 
backsaw ; 1 jack plane; smoothing plane; 1 block plane; 1 marking gauge; 1 sloyd 
knife; 1 spokeshave; 1 bench hook; 1 5 5-inch try-square; 1 2-foot rule; 1 hammer; 
4 chisels. There are also a number of common tools—files, braces, bits, turning saws, 
etc.—at the sides of the room. There are several foot-power machines, but they are 
not used by the boys. 
The drawing room is fitted up with adjustable desks, cases for drawing boards, 
materials, etc. 
The cost of equipment is stated as being $1,600. The annual expense is from $1,200 
to $1,500, including the teacher’s salary. 
Outside of the skill obtained by the pupils there seems to be yery little to show for 
the time spent.

UnitTep States INDIAN SCHOOL, CARLISLE, Pa.   
{Statement of A. J. Standing, assistant superintendent.] 
This school has practiced industrial and manual training from its beginning, seven- 
teen years ago. The object of such training has been instr uction, oceupation, and 
utility. 
Bepcine’ as this school did, with a class of pupils who had no knowledge of the 
English language, it was not practicable to give instruction by any course of lessons 
or explanation ‘of processes. Of necessity, therefore, skill in any trade had to be 
acquired by observation and practice. A competent mechanic was placed at tho 
head of each workshop, whose duty it was to show the apprentices how to do th 
work. The education has been wholly practical, the carpenters working on neces- 
sary buildings and repairs for the school; shoemakers and tailors on articles needed 
for school use; tinners and harness makers on supplies required by the Government; 
blacksmiths and wagon-makers on necessary work for the school farm and in build- 
ing wagons for Government use at Indian agencies. The instruction from the first, 
therefore, has been productive and ata small cost, for the reason that the various 
mechanics employed as instructors have done, with ‘the help of their apprentices, the 
work of the school in their various lines, which otherwise would have had to be done 
by outside mechanics. This system was the only one open to us under the 
stances, and we also think that with undisciplined and uneducated minds 
the best system to pursue; there was not the ability to appreciate a prog vi 
technical course, but the low est intellect can derive some satisfaction from being able 
to make something complete, as a til cup, & pair of shoes, a horseshoe, a ta able, ete. 
Another fe: ature of this system is its great utility to the school, kee US SIIp- 
plied with many articles which, if not manufactured here, would have to be pur- 
chased, combining therefore instruction, occupation, and production. 
rhe system that experience has shown to be the best for us is a half day in the

While the foregoing applies more especially to the instr given to the boys, 
the same system is pursued with the girls, but witl Vv occupations, they

cooking, and some tailoring; but nothing for girls has heen attempted aside from 
these usual and necessary lines. 
The school is purely a Government institution for the education of Indians; it is 
supported by Government appropriation at the rate of $167 per capita per annum, 
all Indians of the United States being eligible without charge except the Five Civil- 
ized Tribes. 
The graduating point of the school is somewhat in advance of the ordinary grain- 
mar grade. Pupils are of all ages, from 8 to upward of 20 years, some entering as 
adults, without any education whatever or even knowledge of the English language, 
They are therefore of all grades, from the adult primary “to tho graduating point, 
Industrial training in the workshops commences when the pupil is of a suitable 
age, and if already grown, when they haye made selection of the particular trade 
which they wish to learn. 
For the younger pupils a sloyd department has been established in connection 
with the class-room work at the schools, where the instruction is purely educational, 
A modification of the Swedish system is used by a competent teacher trained in 
Sweden. A basement room in the school building has been fitted up for this pur- 
pose, which is light and sunny and well ventilated. Ordinary manual training 
benches made in the school workshops are used in this department, the equipment 
being simple, but sufticient. 
Observation by tho teachers leads them to the conclusion that sloyd instruction 
quickens the interest of the younger pupils in their studies and makes them more 
practical and active. In the matter of discipline it is also helpful, makes them 
more cheerful and intelligent, and gives them pleasant exercise, developing a taste 
that will in a marked degree determine their future. It is also expected that when 
the pupils now in the sloyd department are passed on into the trade shops they will 
make much more skillful and intelligent mechanics. 
The school workshops were formerly cavalry stables; they oceupy three sides of a 
quadrangle, the buildings being one story brick, 40 feet w ide, with 12-foot ceilings, 
and a total length of 332 feet. 
The constant aim has been not to introduce a multitude of expensive appliances, 
but to work with such tools as a young man could easily purchase for himself, the 
idea being that the use of hand tools makes the best mechanics. 
In the printing office, which is extremely valuable as an educational and indus- 
trial factor, there are published two papers, all the mechanical work being done by 
the students. The office is the second story of a building 40 by 70 feet; it is well 
lighted, and supplied with a cylinder and three smaller presses, and is a well- 
equipped office, the plant being valued at about $3,000. The motive power is now 
electricity. 
The buildings occupied by the workshops are valued at about $8,000, the plant— 
i.e., tools, etc., exclusive of the printing office—probably $2,000 additional. 
The annual expense of maintenance is very small, for the reason that all the opera- 
tions are productive, with very little waste material, and the labor of instructors 
counts in actual work done for the school. Instruction is therefore practically 
without cost. 
Experience has demonstrated, in the case of this school at any rate, that literary 
progress is almost.as great under the half-day system with an evening study hour 
as by having all-day school, while the gain to the class of pupils under instruction 
in other ways is of inestimable value, contributing to their education, health, and 
discipline. 
Another result of industrial education is that it preserves an equilibrium between 
the abstract and physical in education. It also gives the student an advantage by 
opening another avenue for excellence which he may pursue simultaneously with his 
literary work. The dull student has also a chance to achieve excellence industrially 
where he may be a positive failure in the schoolroom. This success, of course, gives 
him encouragement and self-confidence, so that by the end of his five years’ school 
term ho may be sufficiently well equipped in his chosen trade to enter the labor 
market himself. 
In order that a distinction may be made in the workshops between those who are 
active and intelligent and those who are lazy and unprogressive, a system of grad- 
ing has been established, promotions being made from one grade to another by 
examination at the end of each quarter, grades being that of “helper, apprentice, 
efficient apprentice, and journeyman, no one being graded until having worked at a 
trade four months and shown sufficient ability and adaptitude to follow it up. 
Whatever may be the experience elsewhere, at this school we could not do without 
our industries, the theory of the education here given being first a knowledgo of tho 
English language; second, some industry that will give ability for self- “Support; 
and. lastly, a knowledge of books or purely literary education,

EXTRACTS FROM REPORTS FOR 1894. 
[From the board of trustees.] 
We have in the institution 272 children over 14 years of age—boys, 153; girls, 119. 
Two hundred and sixty-nine are receiving preliminary instruction in industrial pur- 
suits. The importance of industrial training can not be overestimated. 
The clothing department furnishes a good illustration of what may be accom- 
plished in the v way of economy, as well as the great advantage these industries are 
to the boys and girls. To do the work of this department, there were employed in 
1890, 19 lady assistants; in 1891 lady assistants; in 1892, 27 lady assistants. 
Since the introduction of machinery and the conversion ‘of the department into a 
school of industry, the present foreman and instructor, with one lady assistant, 
aided by his pupils, manufactures all the clothing for the children. 
Many other occupations are doing equally well. The interesting reports showing ~ 
the condition and progress of all of them are herewith published, and deserve 
special attention. During the year there has been organized a school of telegraphy, 
and as soon as the necessary funds can be commanded we hope to see a school of 
electricity established.

  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 1149 
[Brom the superintendent. ] 
In no other year of the history of the institution has the manual training depart- 
ment made a better exhibit. The introduction of first-class machinery, especially 
in the printing, clothing, shoe, baking, and engineering departments, has success- 
fully demonstrated the wisdom of training these children in habits of industry and 
to be self-supporting. The reports of the heads of departments show that the labor 
of these children has been utilized in the interest of economy. In every department 
savings are shown, aggregating many thousands of dollars. 
It is the intention, as near as possible, as Henry Ward Beecher said, ‘‘To find the 
bent of each child.” That this is so, the vocations followed by many of our grad- 
uates and ex-pupils give ample proof. 
It is noticeable that the greater number of our children take pride in their trades, 
and the hours devoted thereto do not lessen their interest and standing in the 
schools. A child in every instance employed a half day at industrial training will 
keep up in the study room with a child who goes to school all day.

[From the chief matron.] 
The school of domestic economy, in charge of Miss Belle Pigott, continues to 
instruct successfully our girls in practical and scientific housekeeping and dress- * 
making, thereby dignifying domestic service. Everything that tends to elevate 
labor and make our pupils self-reliant, as well as thorough and competent in all the 
branches taught in schools of a like nature, is here promoted and sustained. 
[From the printing office.] 
At the time of my last annual report 25 boys were at work in the printing office; 
since then 11 have been admitted and 14 discharged, leaving now on the roll 21 
names, 
The work of the department is conducted with the fact constantly in view that 
this is a manual training school and not a commercial printing office; that is, that 
the work is done not for its own value, but to teach how it should be done. The 
effort is made to give each boy who works two years as a half-day pupil a knowledge 
and experience in the trade at least equal to that of the usual apprentice of a full 
year’s experience. Each one, besides typesetting, is given experience in making-up, 
pressfeeding, and other miscellaneous work of a printing office; and one boy in each 
half-day’s force is regularly detailed to do the job printing, which, though limited 
in variety and mostly plain in character and of standard forms, gives fully as varied 
an experience as would be acquired in the same time in any office. 
Of the boys discharged the past year 7 have been reported to me as working at 
printing, though 2 of these gave up their situations to attend schoo!. Of the others, 
some are working in different lines of business and some have not written as to their 
employment. The past record of the department is still sustained that more boys 
from this department find good positions and continue to work at the trade after

I have had an average of 22 boys at work learning the trade. Twelve have been 
discharged; all are fully able to make a living at the trade. 
The work of the past year has been 2,145 pairs of new shoes, worth $4,972.50, and the

$2,359.65. Salary paid to employees, $1,500. 
I find the machinery which was placed i in this department a little over a year ago 
of great benefit to the boys who are learning this trade, This also enables us to 
turn outa greater number of shoes and of better quality. 
  FRIENDFORD INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, RoxBuRY, Mass 
  [Statement of E. C. Hunneman, superintendent.] 
The school, which is a part of the work of the Ruggles Strect Baptist Church, 
meets each Saturday morning at 10 o’clock for a two hours’ session. The term opens 
the last Saturday in October and closes on the first Saturday in May. 
‘The opening exercises each week consist of responsive reading by superintendent 
and school, singing and repeating the Lord’s prayer, after which the several classes 
are formed and work lasts till noon, when the school is dismissed. The membership 
of this department is somethingover 125. 
The central idea in the work of the school is educational—intellectually, practi- 
nd morally. In many cases the influence here is the only refinement the child 
uside from the public schools, where the size of the class prevents the personal 
attention we endeavor to give. If so desired, the work may be carried on outside in 
a trade. 
The boys enter the school of their own desire, but regular attendance and punctu- 
are required. ‘The line of work is optional—sloyd, vearpeatry, and woodcarving, 
chine drawing or free-hand work. 
The school was organized and is supported by the Ruggles Street Baptist Church 
and friends, being in no way dependent on the city for maintenance, No tuition is 
charged, but each boy pays for the material he uses, having the result as his own 
property. In the carpentry and wood-carving and sloyd classes each pupil is 
expected to make something which may be sold for the benefit of the school. 
Various classes are as follows: Primary, ages 5 to 8; about 20 pupils. Work suit- 
able for age of pupil, emphasizing drawing. Elementary mechanical, ages 7 to 9; 
abeut 12 pupils. Use of ruler and T square and angles taught, with application and 
drill of each. Preparatory sloyd, ages 9 to 13; about 30 pupils. In this class the 
pupils draw the models instrumentally to scale, placing dimensions correctly. A 
clear understanding of the work at hand is given by skillful questioning on the part 
of the teacher and from use of model, but no copying from finished drawing is 
allowed. Accuracy and neatness are insisted on as being the fundamental principles 
of all good working drawings. Sloyd, ages 10 to 16; about 28 pupils. Here the 
pupil is assigned the model to be made. First, he draws the model (this time work- 
ing it out for himself, the teacher watching the result step by step), after which he 
carries his drawing to the shop, where wood is given him, and he makes the model 
he has drawn. Machine drawing, ages 9 to 13; about 12 pupils. Projection forms 
the early work of this class, as well as geometry, leading up to the drawing of parts 
of machinery, learning use, etc., of each part of itself and as related to whole 
machine. Carpentry and wood carving, ages 10 to 16; about 22 pupils. Use and 
handling of@tools taught. Small articles of furniture, crickets, stands, frames, etc., 
are made and carved for ornament; and some larger pieces have been made by the 
boys of this class, as chairs, tables, and bookcases. Free-hand, ages 8 to 15; about 
1¢ pupils. This is the only free-hand class, so the work is fitted to the pupil. Out- 
line drawing from models and objects (singly and in groups), light and shade (char- 
coal) drawing of same, as well as from casts, covers the work. 
A year is supposed to be spent in each class, though under favorable cireumstances 
promotions are made from the younger to the next advanced eclass as deemed 
expedient. 
One of the most gratifying results of the work is the strong interest the children 
have for the school. They show hearty enjoyment in their classes and are very 
proud of their work when it is exhibited at the close of the term. A roll of honor 
is awarded to those perfect in attendance, deportment, and faithful work throughout 
the year, and a card of honorable mention to those nearly perfect in the same. 
As this school is one of the many charities of the church, and there is but one 
session a week, the drawing-rooms are not reserved for us alone. One large room or 
hall accommodates the drawing classes. A table on horses is placed between two 
seats for a class which has 10 pupil 
In the free-hand class easels and chairs are provided.

insists on truth, accuracy, and neatness, and leads to practical use of acquired 
knowledge in all branches of work. Manual training offsets the mental training a 
child is constantly receiving, thus making him a well-dev eloped all-round being. 
Some boys after leaving “school go to work with carpenters or machinists, a few 
carry on the work toward draftsmanship, and others do not follow the line at all. 
FREE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, WoBURN, Mas 
  [Statement of Willis S. Carter, principal.] 
Six years ago the Woburn Free Industrial School was started with 12 pupils in 
woodwork, 25 in the sewing department, and 30 in the cooking department. The 
school is run during the summer months only, and has been free to everybody until 
this year, when the age is limited from 10 to 21 years. The school is not a trade 
school; there is no course of study, but each child takes one or more of the courses 
as he chooses, and is constantly advancing. Everything is furnished for the pupils. 
The plant is an old academy building called the Warren Academy. ‘There is a fund 
connected with the estate, part of the interest being given to support the industrial 
school. It costs between $800 and $1,000 to run the school one term. Last year we 
had a total of 400 pupils; this year, 350, the falling off being due to limiting the age. “The school, ever since established, has been very successful, the pupils, parents, 
and general public being interested in the work. 
  New York Stare RErormMarory, Evmrra, N, Y 
[Statement of Z. R. Brockway, general superintendent.] 
The central idea of instruction in the trades school of this reformatory is the prep- 
aration of the inmates in skill and disposition to earn legitimately the means of 
their satisfaction when released. The outlines of instruction in the several trades 
are prepared for a course of one year, Those who by good conduct and gained con- 
fidence of the management are adjudged, after so short a period as one year, to be 
reasonably well fitted for orderly behavior in free society again are not longer detained 
to perfect themselves in their trades, but hayi ing had a year of experience and train- 
ing, if they can find employment as advanced apprentices or in any way in connection 
with the business carried on in society which involves the use of the technical knowl- 
edge imparted here even in this brief period, they are generally released. Of course, 
others who by misconduct or for any reason remain longer than a year get more 
training than those who are discharged in. the shortest time. The organization of 
the trades classes here embraces instruction in thirty- four trades, the instruction 
being given at present in the evening—two evenings each week for most of the trades, 
and three ev enings for a few of them. The ev ening trades school session is of two 
hours’ duration. I may properly add that, since, under the new constitution of the 
State of New York, productive industries must cease in the prisons and reformato- 
ries after the Ist of January next, it is contemplated to bring these trades classes 
under instruction during some portion of every day, thus adding very greatly to the 
number of hours of trades instruction the pupils w ‘ill receive during ‘the period of 
one year. 
The processes of the several trades are subdivided under suitable heads, and there 
is assigned to each division of the processes of each trade a given number of hours 
in which that portion of it is to be accomplished, when always an examination occurs; 
and so, again, at the termination af the arranged course of instruction, areview exam- 
ination is also had. These examinations determine, to the proper extent of them, 
the progress of vach prisoner toward his release. A pupil failing in his trades school 
examination for any month has lost that month, having made no progress during it 
toward the goal of “his desired release; this is with opportunities to recover losse: 
of course. The trades classes are under the special care of a trades school director— 
a graduate of Cornell University, mechanical engineering department—who has a 
trained assistant also, the remaiuder of the instruction being given by mechanics 
resident in the institution or employed to come in from the city adjacent and assisted 
by advanced pupils from among the prisoners. 
The means of support for the institution consist of annual appropriations by the 
legislature and whatever of incidental earnings the inmates accomplish while 
pursuing their trades. The amount of earnings last year was $40,000; the appropri- 
ation by the legislature $200,000. I repeat, as above stated, that after the Ist of 
January next there can be no more earnings, since productive employment is pro- 
hibited by law. 
The age of the pupils for admission here is fixed by law at from 16 to 30 years— 
those convicted of felony, not known to have been previously convicted of a felony. 
All the inmates are confined under the so-called indeterminate sentence. 
         
-P-A-G-E-194
  1152 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The material equipment of the trades classes, aside from the buildings, is a very 
complete one. 
The buildings are within the reformatory inclosure and are a part of the group 
of buildings which, together with the ground upon which they stand, has necessitated 
am investment, roughly ay ted, of $i, 500,000. The average period of detention of 
inmates is about two 
Manual training is for Shee purposes than the practic 
in trades by w hich they are to earn their living. It is a new departure here, and 
likely to bé very much developed to the extent of the systematic manual training 
for the purposes intended for say 300 to 500 of the inmates. From the very complete 
records kept in the institution of the whole previous history and of the physical and 
mental peculiarities of inmates on admission, it has been practicable to easily select 
those manifestly defective as indicated by the records kept, and after a time, during 
which they fail to progress under the ordinary régime of the institution, to with: 
w them and subject them to the manual-training treatment. This departure was 
initiated on the Ist of October last. At present there are 100 defectives receiving 
manual training, not for the purpose of trades instruction, not for the ordinary 
common school manual training purpose, namely, the facilitating of progress of 
pupils in the ordinary common-school studies, but rather for the purpose of over- 
coming by assigned manual exercises, in connection with physical training and the 
educational work of the school of letters, the peculiar discovered mental defect of 
each pupil. A general classification or division of the hundred pupils was made at 
the beginning into three separate groups: First, those apparently ordinarily normal 
in all respects, except in their inability to accomplish simple arithmetical processes— 
those showing a manifest defect in the mathematical faculty of the mind. The 
second group is composed of those possessing ability enough in every direction 
except in the matter of moral control of their conduct. Third, the matoids or 
stupids. In this general classification into three groups the instructor proceeds to 
assign such manual tasks as are believed to most surely call into play the defective 
faculties, namely, the arithmetical faculty of the mind, additional mora] control, and 
with the third division the awakening and quickening of interest and development 
of intellectual power, This latter, I suppose, is substantially the purpose of manual 
training in the common schools. Not time enough has yet elapsed to enable a sum- 
ming up of the work attempted to be accomplished or a tabulation and presentation 
of any results. So much of promise appears upon the surface here in this new edu- 
cational effort for the defective inmates of the reformatory that it is contemplated 
to greatly extend it. Ata late meeting of the managers authority was conferred to 
employ additional instructors, and it is believed that fora large number of the inmates, 
apparently incorrigible under the ordinary régime of the institution, something very 
valuable may be accomplished by these means, and many of them be reseued and 
ultimately be rehabilitated. I have no published matter relating to this, but we 
shall at the close of the fiscal year, September 30 next, write it up in our report to 
the legislature.

Lyman ScHOOL FoR Boys, WESTBORO, Mass. 
[Statement of T. F. Chapin, superintendent.] 
‘We have two shops especially devoted to manual training. The central idea of 
instruction in each is educational, and the training,is obligatory. In one shop the 
training is the sloyd system, as worked out for public schools by Gustaf Larsson, of 
Boston. In the other we have wood turning, machinery, benchwork, and forging. 
About 100 different pupils are instructed in sloyd each year, receiving about 200 
hours each; in the other shop about 32 boys, receiving 400 hours shopwork each. 
The boys are from 13 to 16 years old. Those receiving the iron and wood work com- 
bined are, as a rule, 15 or 16, while those receiving the sloyd are, as a rule, not much 
over 15. 
As far as possible, the instruction is class instruction. In order to provide for the 
quick boy and the slow boy, the boys are classified somewhat with reference to their 
rate of working, and also those who do rapid work are permitted to make designs 
which they work out in their spare moments, thus giving them a kind of busy work. 
The sloyd shop is equipped with 25 benches; the other shop with 16 forges, 16 
benches, and 8 turning lathes. The outlay is principally for tools, and represents, 
perhaps, $2,500. The cost of maintenance aside from instruction is not far from $350 
a year for material, light, and heat for the sloyd, and $250 for the forge and wood- 
turning shop. 
The cost of instruction in sloyd is $900; for iron and wood turning, $1,000. The 
pupils who take this course are visibly more competent in other lines of work, and 
they seem to do, on the whole, better in their schoo] work. 
In a good many individual cases the pupils instructed in manual training, going 
out from the school, seem to do hetter and get better plices to work. We have no 
sufficient data to make a generalization upon in this respect, however.

Pe CHAPTER XXII. 
HIGHER AND SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
By Dr. GABRIEL CoMPAyRé.! 
HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
The following abstracts include the substance of M. Compayré’s report on higher 
education in the United States. They are translations, with little or no condensing 
of the passages selected. The aim has been to present only M. Compayré’s own 
observations or comments on the character and scope of higher education in this 
country as it was presented to him for study, principally at the Columbian Exposi- 
tion at Chicago. So far as possible, therefore, all the details of information which 
are contained in the reports of the Bureau of Education and the catalogues and pro- 
grammes of institutions which M. Compayré was obliged to publish and digest as 
the basis of his observations have been omitted in giving the results of his study, 
they being besides well known. In the course of his work many reflections occur 
to this competent observer from studying the influence upon education of the peculiar 
form of democracy exhibited in this country, which are interesting and valuable— 
not to say entertaining—not only to those who are interested in the special subjects 
under investigation (the teaching of metaphysics, for example), but to the general 
student of social conditions as well. 
M. Compayré begins his review with noting the multiplicity of universities in the 
United States. They abound, he says, in this country. If we have few in France, 
and if even the projects of reconstruction of our higher education promise us only a 
small number of them, it may be said that the Americans have too many, at least. 
apparently. With them the word university has lost its high significance. Any 
institution, however small its pretensions, where Latin and mathematics are taught, 
does not hesitate to give itself the pompous title of university. This great name has 
become vulgarized and almost dishonored by the great number and the mediocrity 
of some of the institutions which have assumed it. There are many pseudo-universi- 
ties which have nothing, or almost nothing, to do with higher education. In the 
statistics published in 1889-90 by the Bureau of Education there are no less than 125. 
universities, and they are of all kinds, including Protestant of all denominations, 
Catholic, and nonsectarian. Some are open to young men only, while others are for 
the benefit of both sexes, and some have been founded expressly for negroes (these 
latter are institutions of an inferior grade, established since the war of secession). 
Their efficiency also varies from those having more than 200 professors and several 
thousand students to others having five or six professors and less than a hundred 
students, Professor Bryce, in his American Commonwealth, speaks of a Western

university where the faculty consisted only of the president and his wife. A glance 
over the list of these 125 or 130 so-called universities is sufficient to show that the 
distinction between secondary and higher education is not clearly established. A 
university simply represents a scholastic institution of a somewhat elevated char- 
acter. To baptize it with the name of university little attention is given to tho 
character of its instruction, whether secondary, technical, agricultural, industrial, 
or superior, in the sense which we attach to the latter term in Europe. This isso 
true that some of the real universities, which by the number of their students and 
the high plane of their studies best merit the name, haye preferred to content them- 
selves with their old and more modest name of colleges. It was only in 1887 that the 
traditionary title of ‘Yale College” was changed to “‘Yale University.” If we 
attempt to distinguish in this multitude of nominal universities those which are in 
reality only small institutions of secondary instruction, comprising the preparatory 
and collegiate departments, and those which approach more or less to the conditions 
which we expect of universities in Europe, there still remains a great number of 
institutions which aspire to give, wholly or in part, what we call in France higher 
instruction—theology, law, medicine, and high scientific, literary, and philosophical 
culture—together with technical instruction, in varying proportions, which in France 
is reserved for special schools, 
A first glance at American universities gives an impression of diversity, an indefi- 
nite multiplicity of forms, and an absence of a common type. To begin with, there 
are the universities which have been founded by private individuals, and which are 
tho most powerful and tho richest in the country, such as Harvard, Yale, Columbia, 
and Princeton, which date from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; others, 
like Cornell and Johns Hopkins, of recent date; and still others—Clark University, 
the University of Chicago, and Leland Stanford University, in California—which 
were founded only within averyshort time. In these institutions, which owe nothing 
or next to nothing to public assistance, which are independent of the State, which 
owe their existence to the liberality of private individuals, and are private corpora- 
tions—some being nonsectarian, while others are under the auspices of a church or 
a denomination—it is natural that the character of the studies should be influenced 
by the private initiative, or tho original wishes of the founder, or of the body of 
men who now have their control. In these institutions the instruction must be 
adapted to tho object for which they were founded, which is evidently not the same 
in universities free from all religions control and pervaded with a purely scientific 
spirit, such as Johns Hopkins or Clark, and where, consequently, there is no theo- 
logical instruction, and in those which are under Methodist or Baptist auspices, as 
at Boston and Chicago. The studies are selected with a view to local needs and 
different environments. At Cornell, for example, professional instruction is upper- 
most, while at Harvard or Yale the old classical training prevails. As means allow 
and when suitable donations have been made for the purpose, new departments of 
instruction are organized. In a word, cach university has its own constitution, nor 
is it obliged to follow a single and uniform model, but adapts itself with an admi- 
rable facility to its varied circumstances, having its own character and ways and ils 
own distinct originality. Some have the stamp of time upon them, and while endeay- 
oring to regenerate themselves and advance in new ways, must still obey their ancient 
traditions, while others, founded from day to day, with millions at their command, 
can, in the full independence of their youth and novelty, make innovations at will 
and inaugurate bold experiments hitherto untried. Side by side with the institu- 
tions of private origin are the State universities (28 in number in 1889-90), which 
are maintained at the public expense, and which, after the primary and high schools, 
complete and crown the national system of education. In them, too, a great 
diversity prevails. They have no fixed rules nor a common programme. In the 
absence of a central power imposing a uniform system of regulations over the whole 
country, each State, like each private corporation, acts in its own way, distributes 
tho studies as it pleases, and restricts or enlarges, as it has means, the number of 
          
 
-P-A-G-E-197
HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. ipo 
departments of instruction. These State institutions also show great diversities in 
their means, ranging from Ann Arbor, with a yearly grant of $274,272 (in 1889-90), 
to others, in Nevada and Oregon, with $30,000, and the teaching corps varies corre- 
spondingly from over 100 to 14 or 15, while the number of students varies from over 
2,000 to a little over 100. 
We do not mean to say that this diversity is in itself an evil. If it is duetoa 
settled intention to develop one part of higher education in particular without neg- 
Jecting the others it would be rather a good. Even when it owes its origin to cir- 
cumstances it has the advantage of parceling out higher culture over the whole 
country. In France, where we are suffering from the contrary evil, we would like 
to have a little more flexibility and variety introduced into the rigid framework of 
our tradition-bound faculties. The question was proposed and answered favorably 
to such a proposition at the Lyons meeting in 1894. It must be said, however, that 
the excessive American decentralization presents grave drawbacks, and leads to a 
dispersion of effort and areal waste of force. Aside from a very small number of 
       
  institutions, seven or eight at most, which really possess all the apparatus for high 
education, American universities are, generally, only the beginnings or fragments of 
  universities. The different portions of superior instruction are scattered in a multi- 
tude of separate institutions so that both professors and students are in insufficient 
numbers in most of them. This is a necessary consequence of a system of excessive 
liberty of initiative. Each State and each city wishes to have its university, and 
there appears the contrary of what happens in France, where we sometimes haye the 
thing but not the name—they have the appearance and paraphernalia of a university 
without the solid and substantial reality. In America they first build a city, open 
its streets, lay the pavements and gas pipes, or light with electricity, and then the 
inhabitants come if they can. I ought to add that they generally do come, and in 
large numbers. But the same process applied to the foundation of universities does 
not always succeed. The buildings are erected, the programmes drawn up, the pro- 
fessors appointed, and then the students are awaited, but it sometimes happens that 
they do not crowd to the new institution. 
  LAW SCHOOLS AND MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
If we reflect that there are 52 law schools in the United States, it is not necessary 
to consult statistics to learn how prejudicial this excessive dissemination is to the 
study of law, there being neither a sufficient number of capable professors nor of 
students to constitute solid and vital centers of instruction. [The statistics quoted 
show that the number of students ranged from 1 to nearly 500, and the professors 
from 1 to 23.] Harvard and Yale had only 153 and 106 students, respectively, while 
there is no law school at Johns Hopkins, or Princeton, or Clark University. So 
with medical schools; the report for 1888-89 showed that aside from many nonregu- 
lar schools there were 94 distinct institutions in that year, with a great range in 
numbers of students and professors. 
DISPERSION OF EFFORT AND WASTE OF FORCE. 
We can not too often repeat that, sustained by their enormous wealth, the Ameri- 
cans give themselves over to a veritable waste of force. They commit follies in the 
way of education. Carried away by local pride, or, rather, to speak more accu- 
rately, moved by the legitimate desire to put higher education within reach of the 
young in as many places as possible, they increase the number of foundations of 
the same kind without caring for doubling the expenditure of money for the same 
purpose or disturbing themselves about competition, so that it too often happens 
that their costly institutions, which have been established under unfavorable condi- 
tions on an unfruitful soil, languish painfully, and only make a problematical suc- 
cess. But how could it be otherwise when we find three or four schools of law or 
medicine not only in the same region but in the same city?

1156 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
This is a luxuriant vegetation of which we can form no idea in our country of 
restricted activity and limited initiative, a vigorous growth which springs up on 
every side, and if it is impossible to disguise the bad features of this unrestrained 
fecundity, we can not repress our admiration at the extraordinary power of the sap 
which so profusely nourishes the numberless branches of the tree of knowledge even 
at the risk of their mutual injury from their varied superabundance and intergrowth, 
THE IDEA OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
From what has been said upon the schools of law and medicine, one might be 
tempted to conclude that the Americans have but little conception of the necessity 
of uniting or grouping side by side, like the different children of a family, the diff 
ent branches of superior instruction, and that the idea of the university—that is to 
say, of an intimate association of all the higher studies—does not exist in the United 
States. Such a conclusion would not be absolutely ex: There is undoubtedly a 
marked disposition to regard the schools of law and medicine as capable of separate 
growth and function in the condition of professional schools, which is their official 
title. They have a separate place in the report of the Bureau of Education, under 
the head of professional instruction, by the side of the theological schools. In the 
same way, conformably to this spirit of special classification, the schools of pure or 
applied science (of technology, agriculture, and mechanic arts), some endowed by 
the State and the others private institutions, are placed separately under the head of 
schools of science, even when they are annexed to universities. The contrary tend- 
ency, however, is making its appearance in the opinions of some of the leaders of 
American pedagogy and is also becoming realized in fact. Thus, at the Chicago 
congress we heard Prof. Woodrow Wilson, of Princeton, announce his deliberate 
opinion that a professional school could not exist by itself. It must, he said, form 
part of a university, so that the university atmosphere may envelop and penetrate 
it. And, in fact, in most of the leading universities, those which, by their work of 
two centuries or more, have gradually enlarged their scope, like Harvard and Yale, 
and also in those which we see springing out of the ground at the magic call of their 
miilionaire founders, like Leland Stanford, for example, the idea of the universality 
of instruction seems to prevail. Compared with so many other institutions which 
are, as we have seen, only fragments or portions of universities, the most renowned 
of the new institutions aspire, not without an evident exaggeration, to embrace eae 
contain everything in the nature of high instruction. 
    
  46 * * * + * * 
Haryard and Yale disconcert our habits of measurement and surpass our mediocre 
imaginations by offering to the choice of their students fifteen or twenty distinct 
programmes of special studies. They resemble towers of Babel, where all languages 
are spoken, or rather scholastic caravansaries where one can provide oneself with all 
articles concerning instruction. The truth is that we are in the presence of two 
opposite conceptions of the development of the university, between which the 
leaders of American pedagogy have not yet made a final choice, On one hand is the 
tendency to particularization, as shown by the existence of so many schools of law 
and medicine, and independent and isolated scientific schools, as is shown also by 
the recent creation of universities really worthy of the name, which, expressly dis- 
claiming a complete education, aim at excelling some parts only of the entire field 
of knowledge, such as Clark University, which is above all and almost exclusively 
a school of experimental sciences analogous to one of the sections of our Ecole 
frangaise des Hautes Etudes; such, also, as Cornell University, which is principally 
aschool of agriculture and mechanic arts, the equivalent to both our Institut agro- 
nomique and our Ecole centrale. On the other hand, there is the opposite tendency 
toward the excessive centralization of all these studies and the full application of 
the formula of Comenius, ‘omnia doceantur.” M.Compayré then proceeds to follow 
the discussion, given in the “proceedings” of the Chicago meeting, of the question
-P-A-G-E-199

whether universities should be of a uniform type, and concludes that if, even in 
France, where central authority has such weight, the effort to compel uniformity 
has been unsuccessful, still less is it to be expected that the dissertations of educa- 
tional theorists could force uniformity in a country where each university corpora- 
tion and each political community can dispose of its resources as it wishes, 
FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES, 
The want of money alone can prevent the growth of American universities, which 
is an improbable event, says M. Compayré, in educational matters in the rich and 
generous American democracy. What, he continues, are our expenditures of ten or 
twelve millions [of francs] for higher education, obtained, too, with difficulty, com- 
pared with the sumptuous liberality, nay, the princely prodigality, for its universi- 
ties of which America is constantly giving examples? We could not understand the 
situation of higher education in the United States if we did not consider, above all, 
how rich the universities are there, and how the dollars flow in to endow them and 
maintain them in a splendid condition. In the first place—and it is a circumstance 
which is hardly met with elsewhere and certainly exists nowhere else in the same 
degree—there is the extraordinary emulation among private benefactors—enriched 
individuals of the industrial and commercial classes—who believe that they can — 
not make a better use of their fortunes than by devoting them partly, sometimes 
wholly, to the foundation, support, or development of schools of higher instruc- 
tion. Sometimes, if they are particularly rich, they create at onestroke a new uni- 
versity, complete from top to toe. Sometimes, to increase the scope of an old insti- 
tution, they present it with a department or faculty which it needs, or, at least, with 
a special chair; and, again, if they can do nothing more, they enrich libraries already 
existing with collections of books, or equip laboratories and museums with costly 
instruments and rare specimens. What is elsewhere only an accident or a rarity isa 
habit in America. The United States is the only country in the world where proper 
names are given to the universities, the names of the generous men to whom they owe 
either their existence or their aggrandizement. Harvard, De Pauw, Cornell, Vander- 
bilt, Johns Hopkins, and Clark are at once the names of universities and of the free 
givers who have contributed more or less, in proportion to their means, to building up 
these different houses of study. Sometimes the benefactor conceals his identification 
with the university by suppressing hisname. Forexample, the foundation of the Cath- 
olic University at Washington was due to the liberality of Miss Caldwell, of Phila- 
delphia. So, also, Mr. John D. Rockefeller would certainly have a right to be called 
the godfather of the recently founded University of Chicago, since he presented it 
with more than $5,000,000 for its christening. 
Of course the universities of the United States have not always had such splendid — 
beginnings, such fortunate births. But even those which, like Harvard and Yale, 
had an humble origin and received only a moderate endowment from their original 
benefactor, have seen their treasury increase year by year, thanks to the incessant 
and continuous generosity of their former students, their protectors, and their 
friends, What the fanciful munificence of a Leland Stanford could do at one stroke 
in California an uninterrupted succession of small gifts has accomplished, or almost 
accomplished, at Harvard. In two centuries and a half Harvard bas come to possess 
an annual revenue of $720,000. Who is to ask such wealthy institutions to moderate 
their ambition and contract the sphere of their activity? Their resources are enor- 
mous, nearly unlimited, and it is natural that their scope should be correspond- 
ingly great. 
After giving a brief account of State institutions and State aid, including land 
grants, M. Compayré proceeds to the subject of degrees and their multiplicity in 
America. He continues as follows: American universities, therefore, are rich and 
even opulent from various sources, but it is not their popularity alone (whereof their 
riches are the proof) which will maintain and develop them. It must be said that  
-P-A-G-E-200
1158 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
» is another cause, of an entirely different order, which tends to promote the 
ve multiplicity ofeducational institutions, and thatis the conferring of degrees. 
prerogative, which is too easily accorded to institutions of all grades, is a power 
which those who possess it appreciate very highly and which they are not disposed 
tosnrrender; and this explains, in part, the great number of colleges and universities 
in America. We all know the extent to which the division and subdivision of degrees 
are pushed in the United States, and this fact would suffice to show, without any 
examination of the programmes, how fragmentary and scattered, and consequently 
how superficial, to some extent, much of the American education is. It is true that 
we suffer from the same evil in France to some extent, and there is the story of a can- 
didate for a degree who presented himself before one of our faculties on the morning 
when he was to begin his written examination, perhaps a little sleepy or confused by 
tho near approach of the dreaded ordeal, and who declared that he did not know 
exactly in what particular series of what particular section he was to begin his work. 
He was like a traveler who enters a railway station where there are many trains 
ready to start and asks anxiously for the proper train to which his ticket entitles 
him. I know that much can be said in favor of this system, and that just as it is 
fortunate that the network of railways by their multiplicity make communication 
easier, so it may be urged that by splitting up and diversifying the baccalaureates, 
licenses, and doctorates we facilitate success by augmenting the number of ways of 
reaching it. Nevertheless we must say that the object to be attained has been 
execcedcd in the United States. We are far from equaling the Americans in this 
respect, with their endless nomenclature of diplomas of all kinds. Nowhere, except 
in the country of the mandarins, has the superstition of degrees been pushed to such 
an extreme; and it may be said in passing that in America it is not always well to 
refuse diplomas even to those who do not deserve them. With us the victims of the 
examinations content themselves with reviling their judges. Bad marks are rare, 
and the rage for obtaining diplomas is only equaled by the facility with which they 
can be obtained at least from certain institutions. 
(The statistics quoted show that in 1889-90 some 400 colleges and universities con- 
ferred nearly 10,000 degrees of twenty-four or twenty-five different kinds.)    
          THE DEGR' 
  E OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY. 
We will not insist upon what is so strange from our European point of view, viz, 
seeing bachelors in music or painting, or doctors of veterinary medicine, nor upon 
other singular peculiarities such as that one can become a bachelor in philosphy 
after having followed a course simply of geology, chemistry, or architecture, nor 
upon the confusion which results from giving different names to the same degree. 
What merits our attention more, and what the Americans themselves most complain 
of, is the absence of guaranties, the insufficiency of the conditions under which the 
degree of doctor in philosophy is granted, 2 degree which assures to its possessors 
more consideration than any other. The question was discussed fully at Chicago and 
the evil was clearly defined. Onone hand is the ardor with which the title of Ph. D. 
is sought if only for the sake of being called ‘‘doctor,” and on the other is the culpa- 
ble compliance of some institutions which lend themselves, unfortunately, to the 
unjustified pretensions of tho seekers after diplomas. It is interesting to remark 
that while in France we aspire to a certain degree of diversity, the Americans would 
like to have a little more centralization. We complain of an excess of regulations, 
while they regret the absence of a common directing power. One of the speakers at 
the Chicago congress, Mr. Sproull, dean of the faculty of the University of Cincin- 
nati, expressed the wish that there should be a general understanding in regard to 
the essential conditions to which the examination for the degree of doctor in philos- 
ophy should conform, As there could be no appeal in such a matter to a ministerial 
department or a central government, it was suggested to appoint a committee com- 
posed of the chiefs of the principal universities.. It should be the duty of this
-P-A-G-E-201
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 1159 
committee to draw up a list of the institutions which it should judge were qualified by 
their importance and the value of their studies to confer the degree. A journal, to 
be the organ of the committee, would publish this list, which might be extended or 
restricted from year to year. This proposition was accepted by the congress and 
acommittee was appointed, including the presidents of the Johns Hopkins, Yale, 
Columbia, Princeton, Chicago, and California universities, with instructions to take 
the necessary steps to maintain the plane and protect the significance of the degrees 
of doctor of philosophy and of science. 
* * * * x “ “ 
This committee will have only a moral effect, as it has no legal sanction or au- 
thority. 
Moreover, it is not only in itself and at the moment of conferring it that the high 
degree of doctor allows of criticism and is too easily acquired. On this point it 
is some defense to say that the evil is not general; that certain institutions main- 
tain the dignity of this title, and that after all an enlightened public opinion can 
distinguish the tares from the wheat. A graver fault is that even the more serious 
universities open their courses of law and medicine to students who are insufficiently 
prepared. It is not yet a settled question in the United States whether an antece- 
dent liberal education should be required of students in law and medicine or not. 
Americans are right in retaining the titles of professional schools for their schools of 
Jaw and medicine. The instruction which is usually given in those schools, as it 
does not rest upon the solid base of a liberal, that is to say general, education, hardly, 
merits the dignified name of higher education. As it is given to young men who 
haye not received secondary instruction, and are therefore without sufficient prepa- 
ration, who often leave college in their froshman year to enter the professional 
school, the instruction they receive in the latter can only form practitioners and 
empirics without breadth of mind or a wide scope, and who will be imprisoned 
closely in the circle of routine and daily business. The Americans are well aware of 
this defect, but are at a loss how to remedy it. Opposed to the interest of society, 
which demands better instructed physicians and lawyers, is the interest of the indi- 
vidual, who demands the shortest cut to the practice of a lucrative profession. 
There is no appeal to the law. ‘One of the principles the most intimately and 
tenaciously united with our conception of a democratic government is that admis- 
sion to the different professions should remain almost absolutely free, and our legis- 
lators are unwilling to place any restrictions upon it.” So it is public opinion, as 
usual, which must be convinced, and that is far from being won over. ‘Public 
opinion is not disposed to act summarily in this matter, because it has not yet learned 
that general education ought to precede professional instruction. A given commn- 
nity is proud that its lawyers were admitted to the bar after only six weeks of 
study.” As long as the public is satisfied, doctors and lawyers without education 
will continue to multiply. Even,if public opinion should reach the idea of reform it 
would not be easy to carry it out. ‘In America reforms can only be made bit by 
bit, by way of trial and example; there is no central authority which can impose 
them all at once and in their entirety.” [The name of the author from whom M. 
Compayré takes these quotations is not given.] In short, the remedy must come from 
those universities which, like Harvard, are rich and strong enough to be severe, - 
and demand from their students sufficient evidences of qualification, and if the mete 
conception of the ideal were sufficient to realize it, higher education in America 
would have nothing to desire. 
The evil is aggravated by the short duration of the course of study; while primary 
and secondary studies are relatively long and slow in America, and are free from the 
feverish, dizzy rapidity which seems to whirl everything along, university studies 
are too much abridged and too hurried. By a kind of regrettable compensation, ~ 
after the American student has loitered and reflected a little in the high schools and 
academies and then in the colleges, from which he emerges as a bachelor of arts at 
the age of twenty-one, two, or even three years of age, in the universities he is 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
1160 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
  obliged to quicken his pace, and in three years he becomes a doctor of medicine, or 
in four a doctor inlaw. This triennium or quadriennium also is a maximum, and is 
only required in the more important universities. In many institutions less time 
is required, as the statistics quoted show. 
  RECRUITING OF PROFESSORS. 
The requirements which must be fulfilled in France before a candidate can receive 
the appointment of professor do not obtain in the United States. ‘Anybody who 
_ chooses may call himself a professor ”(Discourse of President Jordan, Proceedings, 
p. 34). But the great universities at least make the greatest efforts to obtain a per- 
sonnel which shall be of the highest rank. Cardinal Newman’s saying is often 
quoted in America, ‘Install your universities in hovels or tents, if you will, but 
give them great teachers.” The Americans do not install their universities in hovels, 
but they do try to give them great teachers, and for this purpose they resort to aid on 
every side, The titular professor of the chair of European history at Leland Stan- 
ford University is Dr. Andrew D. White, who was envoy extraordinary and minister 
plenipotentiary from the United States to Germany from 1879 to 1881, and in 1892 to 
Russia. His name gives reputation to the chair assigned him. At the same uni- 
versity Mr. Harrison, who was Mr. Cleveland’s predecessor as President of the United 
States, is the professor of constitutional law. These are things which are only seen 
in the United States, and we would have difficulty, in France, in imagining a former 
«President of the Republic, Mr. Grévy, for instance, giving lectures on law. Of 
course, it is hardly necessary to say the salaries of the university professors are 
large. They also enjoy all sorts of facilities for their work. They are allowed to 
visit Europe periodically and study on the spot, at some university, the progress of 
their favorite science. When Mr. Stanley Hall was nominated as president of his 
university, and before he assumed his duties, he made a lengthy visit in Europe to 
examine the organization of higher education there. A great number of American 
university professors have studied in Europe, especially in Germany. They also 
move about a good deal in their own country and change their residence frequently, 
on account of the great number of institutions and the difference in the salaries. 
        
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR? 
American pedagogy has clearly conceived, in its dreams for the future, even if 
there is no present realization, that the function of a university professor is not only 
to transmit ready-made knowledge to his students, but that his mission is to create 
knowledge as well—that is to say, to add to the patrimony of acquired truths and 
extend the field of knowledge by original researches, President Jordan says that 
“a professor to whom original investigation is unknown should not find a place in a 
university. The day will come when our universities will understand that the most 
useful of its professors may be those who give no lectures, but devote all their 
strength and time to profound investigation. Their presence and example are, per- 
haps, a hundred fold more valuable for a body of students than the lectures of other 
teachers.” The idea of a higher instruction looking to the future rather than the 
past and opening out new ways to science is, therefore, not new to American peda- 
gogy. Iteven appears that in certain universities it dominates with some exaggera- 
tion and diverts a certain number of teachers from their original duties. If we may 
believe a Harvard professor, who has described the spirit and tendencies of that uni- 
versity in the Educational Review [for April, 1894, an article by Professor Santa- 
yana], it sometimes happens that some of his colleagues, in the exclusive preoccupa- 
tion of their investigations and personal work, come to forget and neglect their 
professional occupations. Hesays: ‘ There still remain at Harvard some professors 
of the old school, with whom intimate and moral relations with the students is the 
first care, but for the typical young professor the principal interest is science,” and 
we are shown these teachers demonstrating with indifference and almost with dis-

dain the well-known principles, which are, however, the foundation of instruction, 
and only becoming animated when they come to speak of the novelties and discoy- 
eries of the day. They aspire to be scholars and are teachers only by accident. 
STUDIES, TEACHERS, AND METHODS. 
Speaking in a general way, it may be said that the best American universities sen- 
sibly approximate the ideal of higher instruction, but in the greater number of 
universities of second or third rate the common defects are excessive specialization, 
a dribbling out of knowledge, the want of a broad initiation into the principles of 
science, and an anxiety to get a diploma as soon as possible. Of these institutions 
the criticism may be repeated that has already been made of English colleges. “In 
them letters are not literary enough and science is not learned enough; in the former 
they only study texts and in the latter processes.” (Quotation from Demogeot et 
Montucci, De l’enseignement secondaire en Angleterre.) Whatever may be the specu- 
lative efforts of friends of the university in the United States, it is not in vain that 
their surroundings are utilitarian, so that their institutions are like scholastic oases 
planted in an immensity of workshops, grain elevators, cattle yards, docks, and 
manufactories of every kind, and that they have the formidable task of maintaining 
the rights of thought and opening the springs of moral and intellectual life in the 
midst of a society which is a prey to an infernal industrial activity, and is, as it were, 
possessed or bewitched by the demon of business. It is impossible that the univer- 
sities themselves should not be affected, in their tendencies and spirit, by the prac- 
tical and positive character of the entire nation. Even in the schools of the great- 
est renown the methods in repute would not accord with our ideas. In the law 
school at Yale, for example, the methods consist largely in learning by heart. The 
lecture rooms have the significant name of recitation rooms. Properly speaking, 
there is no didactic course, no lectures ex cathedra. The student studies his text- 
book in his own room and is questioned upon it in the lecture room, the teacher limit- 
ing himself to giving explanations upon the subject studied. ‘It is the conviction 
of the faculty of law,” say the Yale programmes, ‘‘and it is also the tradition of the 
entire university, that precise and durable impressions of the principles of every 
abstract science are best acquired by the study of text-books at leisure in the stu- 
dent’s room, and supplemented by the questions and explanations which are given in 
the recitation room.” We must add that this method of instruction is not of gen- 
eral use in American law schools. At Harvard, for instance, the method by recitation 
is formally repudiated; the regulations declare that it is not desirable to memorize 
pages of text-books. In the law schools, as in all others, care is taken to favor 
practical exercises, and the students are encouraged to discuss the subjects taught, 
either by themselves or under a professor. So in the scientific schools extreme 
importance is attached to manipulations and laboratory experiments; without sup- 
pressing theoretical instruction, greater attention is given to the practical side, to 
things which the student learns by himself in the laboratories, which are admirably 
furnished with all the instruments and appliances of research. 
One thing which acts as a constraint upon the full development of American univer- 
sities is that they find difficulty in freeing themselves from the traditions of second- 
ary instruction. (Secondary in the French sense, as here used, relates to the lycée, 
which corresponds to our high or preparatory school with two years of our colleges.) 
* * * * * * * 
They started, for the most part, with being simply colleges, and only gradually 
have the schools of law and medicine, of letters and higher sciences been added to 
the primitive colleges, usually by the wills of generous benefactors, like so many 
annexes, which are rather juxtaposed than associated and fused together in a har- 
monious plan. New departments, institutes of fine or industrial arts, of music, 
schools of veterinary medicine or electricity or archwology are constantly added to

1162 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
a pedagogical domain-which is constantly widening, and this indefinite branching 
out is not always crowned with success. Harvard, for example, has recently found 
that it is difficult for studies which are too dissimilar to prosper side by side. The 
Bussy Institution, which was established there at great expense, only had six stu- 
dents in 1892-93. In many years it has only conferred three or four diplomas of 
bachelor of agricultural sciences, most of its students being only amateurs 
The great evil which pervades the whole system of American education is that it 
is without definitions and delimitations. In France we do not mix different things, 
and are fond, perhaps excessively so, of logical regulations. We allow only well- 
defined categories and precisely determined divisions. In American institutions, 
on the contrary, everything is confused and intermixed. Secondary instruction 
is divided into two portions, one, corresponding to our grammar schools (c¢ 
de grammaire), in the high schools and academies, and the other, which is nearly 
equivalent to the higher classes in our lycées, in the colleges and the uniy 
Out of 2,000 students at Yale, only some 500 take the higher instruction. Of 1 
at Cornell and 1,000 at Princeton, there are not over 200 who take univ 
courses, properly so called. Everywhere the collegians, tho under graduates, 
that is the students of secondary instruction, form the great majority. Anyone 
can see the great disadvantage of this coexistence of two kinds of instruction 
which are profoundly distinct in their character and objects. Is there not danger 
that the interests of one or the other might be sacrificed; that the secondary 
instruction might become too specialized and too technical, so as to loso its proper 
character, which is to give a general culture to the mind? May it not be that pro- 
fessors who teach both in the university and the college (at least as far as letters and 
seience are concerned) might either import into their secondary instruction the 
requirements and habits of learned research which do not belong to it, or, conversely, 
might they not introduce into their higher instruction the clementary methods of 
college instruction, whereby the higher culture would be lowered/and lessened, the 
line of demarcation between tho ‘two not being well defined? If we complain in 
France—and not without reason—that the professors of the faculties of letter 
sciences are impeded in their proper work of scientific investigation and orig 
work by the heavy and tedious drudgery which the baccalaureate examinations 
. impose upon them several times a year, in America the evil is still greater, becanso 
there the professors not only have charge of the examinations but of the studies 
which precede them besides. 
[M. Compayré devotes a short notice each to students, clubs and univ 
sion, and coneludes this introductory review with presenting the views of we 
American university presidents upon higher education in America. He can not 
refrain from admiring the spacious and sometimes even palatial buildings of univer- 
sities and schools.]  ‘‘ Undoubtedly,” he says, ‘‘the largest and finest buildings in 
America are generally those of banking and commercial houses or hotels, but the 
buildings for educational institutions, whether universities or primary schools, are 
thorivals, at least, of church edifices both in size and the ornamental character of their 
architecture. Externally they look like strongly built chateaux or citadels with 
towers, buttressesand battlements. Within, with their large, vaulted halls, th ol- 
onnades and bas-reliefs, they resemble temples. Ah, what fine class and lecture 
rooms there are at Harvard and Yale! How spacious and convenient, with plenty of 
light and air! It is impossible to visit them without thinking how good it would 
be to study or lecture in them.” 
(The remaining chapters of the work are devoted to details of the various univer- 
sities and their programmes. We pass to the chapter on instruction in philosophy, 
to which, as the highest branch of learning, M. Compayré devotes considerable 
attention, and give the following extracts.]

AMERICA HAS AS YET NO ORIGINAL PHILOSOPHY. 
The story goes that an intensely patriotic citizen of Chicago once asked his fellow- 
citizens if they would like to establish a school of ‘‘ American geometry.” We need 
not be astonished at this naive outburst of nationalism in the midst of a people 
which voluntarily affects to depend on itself alone, and which would like to show 
itself original in all things. It must be acknowledged, at any rate, that there is yet 
very little originality in philosophy in America despite very laudable efforts in that , 
direction, and that if an American geometry is impossible, there is, properly speak- 
ing, no ‘American philosophy.” Undoubtedly there has been a great change since 
De Tocqueville wrote, in alltruth, ‘I believe that there is no country in the civilized 
world where so little attention is given to philosophy as in the United States. The 
Americans have no philosophical school of their own, and they care very little about 
those which divide Europe. They hardly know eyen their names.” On this point, 
as on some others, the reflections of the author of ‘‘Democracy in America” have 
become somewhat antiquated. Time has been moving, and to keep oneself au 
courant and not fall behind in studying a nation particularly active and alive, 
which is always going ahead, one must strike the balance of its progress every year 
and almost every month. The Americans of to-day differ in their intellectual and 
moral condition from those described by De Tocqueville nearly as much as some of 
their large cities—Washington, or Chicago for instance—Chicago especially—aro 
different now from what they were fifty years ago, Even in the domain of philo- 
sophical speculation, where progress is least perceptible, meritorious attempts have 
been made in these latter days, and some interesting results have been reached, 
especially in direct contrast to what De Tocqueville affirmed, and what he was justi- 
fied in saying, halfa century ago. It is true that the works of European philosophy, 
preferably the latest, are now studied with ardor and often with enthusiasm, and it 
would not be paradoxical to say that German philosophers are better known and more 
frequently translated and read at the present time in America than in France. 
However, De Tocqueville uttered a permanent truth when he said that ‘the social 
condition of the Americans turns them away from speculative studies.” Without 
taking too strictly the humorous adage which the Americans themselves repeat, that 
philosophers are as rare in America as snakes in Norway, we must acknowledge 
that they are not numerous, and it is not difficult to discern tho reason of their 
rarity. 
SUPREMACY OF THEOLOGY, OR, AT LEAST, THE CHRISTIAN SPIRIT. 
What strikes us at first is that philosophy is much more under the influence of 
* religious belief in the United States than in Europe. ‘The “servant of theology” is 
far from having shaken off the old yoke in most American colleges and universities. 
The State University of California, for instance, announces itself as nonsectarian, 
but it nevertheless remains religious in tone, as its president declares. In a country 
where theology and religions thought are diversified and separated into an infinity 
of distinct sects and denominations, philosophical thought finds in this same diver- 
sity a semblance of frecdom and easily accommodates itself to each creed. And, on 
the other hand, a vague, undefined Christianity is always exercising its sway, even 
over the most enfranchised minds, so that, in one way or another, it is almost always 
under the patronage of religion that philosophy strives hesitatingly to develop 
itself. 
THE NONTHEOLOGICAL SPIRIT IS RARE IN AMERICA. 
The “lay” spirit, as we understand it in France, is a rarer thing than would be 
expected in the free American society. Even when they believe that they do not 
belong to any religious denomination, that they are unsectarian, the educational 
institutions, as we have said, can not always detach themselves from biblical 
traditions. Here is a striking example: ‘When I visited Girard College,” says M. 
Paul de Rouziers [la vie Americaine, p. 656], “the janitor asked me if I was a clergy- 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
1164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
man. I was surprised, and made him repeat the question; and when, after I had 
answered in the negative, | was admitted into the building, I related the cireum- 
stance to the president. ‘These are the instructions,’ he replied, ‘ because Girard, the 
founder, declared in his will that no minister of any denomination should ever cross 
_ the threshold of the college.’ ‘But what is the meaning of that handsome chapel?’ 
Tasked. ‘It is for religious exercises. We have prayers there morning and evening, 
and on Sunday one of us gives a lecture on the Bible.’ ‘And do you think that the 
shade of Girard is pleased with these lectures?’ ‘Oh, you know the Bible is unsecta- 
rian.’” So here is a college which its founder, a French freethinker grown rich in 
the United States, endowed generously on the condition that no clergyman should 
ever be admitted to it, and whose legatees, faithful as is usual in America to the 
wishes of the testator, really believe that they are carrying out his will by refusing, 
very vigorously it is true, the entrée of the college to clergymen even for a visit, 
while they throw the doors wide open to the sacred books of Christianity. In such 
a medium—of men completely imbued with Christianity, even when they belong to 
no denomination—philosophy—that is to say, the spirit of independent research 
which goes right on to the conquest of truth, without caring cither for the beliefs 
which it may injure on its way or the dogmas which it will have to contradict ulti- 
mately—philosophy necessarily remains the privilege of a select number of enterpris- 
ing and bold men. The crowd of thinkers continues to move in the narrow and 
impassable circle in which traditional opinions inclose the steps of human reason 
without feeling its limitations or aspiring to a liberty of which they feel no need. 
We have examined a great number of catalogues of American colleges. Philosophy 
is certainly represented in them, but inthe mostelementary andhumble form. Ingen- 
eral the president of the college takes charge of instruction in philosophy, which is 
usually moral and pedagogical and most often designed as an instrument of edification 
or of Christian moralization rather than an’ensemble of free and scientific research. 
The professor is rarely a specialist in philosophy; he unites with that accidental 
instruction other and very different kinds. If it is true that in Spain, asis said, there 
are still professors of Latin and singing, and if we remember to have known at the 
college of Soréze in France a regent who boldly styled himself ‘‘ professor of rhetoric 
and physics,” this confusion of things which, with us, is a very rare exception, is of 
very frequent occurrence in America. 
  THEOLOGICAL TENDENCY OF PHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUCTION. 
But it is not only the insufficiency or the want of specialization on the part of the 
teachers which compromises the future of philosophical studies in the United States. 
The primordial cause of the evil—we must repeat—is the semitheological tendency 
of the instruction. This tendency is favored and developed by the private nature 
of most of the secondary and superior institutions of learning. In France, political 
and social centralization, of which the university is the scholastic expression, undoubt- 
edly has its inconveniences and dangers. Butitat least permits the State to disengage 
a sort of general conscience from the ensemble of diverse and often contradictory 
individual aspirations, which becomes the rule of education and elevates university 
studies above all sectarian spirit and any particular religious tendency. In our 
lyeées and faculties a teacher of philosophy is not responsible to anyone except his 
own conscience and society—the nation at large. Now, the nation is neutral as far 
as religious opinions are concerned, and consequently theological prejudices do not 
enter the philosophical lecture room. In America, on the contrary, where the system 
of private initiation prevails, so fruitful from other points of view, where colleges and 
universities owe their existence for the most part to the liberality of some private 
individual enriched by commerce or industry, who has become philanthropic in his 
old age, and where the institutions are under the supervision of a committee of 
trustees who are the vigilant depositories and guardians of the will of the founder, 
and sometimes under the direction of the founder himself, if he is still alive, it is to 
be feared that the freedom of the teacher of philosophy may often be only a myth,

  HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 1165 
Those who have contributed from their means to create and maintain an institution 
naturally wish that the spirit of its studies should conform to their own opinions or 
doctrinal preferences. They, or their executors, have the choice of teachers, and it 
can not be expected that they should take professors from outside the ranks of the 
faithful of their own denomination. The college or university becomes thus the 
chattel or property of one man or a small number of men. It would be unjust not 
to add that these observations do not apply to all the universities of America. At 
Harvard, at Columbia, and half a dozen other institutions—to take the figures of 
Mr. Stanley Hall—emancipation is nearly complete. We are only speaking of the 
generality of colleges and universities. | i 
It is noticeable, too, that the American who is so active and energetic in business 
matters becomes indifferent and indolent about questions which have no direct 
relation with practical life. Doubt does not seem to be in any sense an American 
product. It is astonishing how easily ready-made dogmas and a well-determined 
religion, which is accepted without discussion, satisfy positive, busy men, who have 
no time to seek for truth at their own risk and peril, through the difficulties and 
obseurities of philosophical speculation, and who yet wish to satisfy their need of 
belief. And so they like to observe Sunday by complete repose after the feverish 
labor of the week, and they are willing to bestow, as the crowning act of their 
tormented life, a docile acquiescence upon any religion which will free them from 
all intellectual worry and offer them the tranquil shade of traditional beliefs. Add 
to this that the flexibility of American theology is of a nature to facilitate adherence, 
If you find that you are unwilling to accept some of the numerous Christian dogmas, 
which you are called upon to believe, do not let that disturb you; there will always 
be some accommodating sect which has effaced the objectionable articles from its 
creed, and so can free you from the trouble of submitting your belief to them, In 
this profusion of different denominations, if we may be permitted to use so familiar 
an expression, all tastes can be satisfied. The choice is easy; the supply always 
responds to the demand. In France, if you have broken with one of the two or 
three accredited religions, you are reduced to the necessity of entering at once the 
diocese of free thought; there is no intermediate ground between belief and 
unbelief. But in the United States there is a multitude of degrees of successive 
steps and insensible transitions interposed between ignorant and blind bigotry on 
the one hand and free thought on the other, the latter being rarely met with. 
* * * * * * * 
  But, however convenient for preserving liberty of conscience may be these mani- 
fold forms of a Christianity, which is more and more attenuated, in which dogma is, 
so to speak, reasoned out in different ways, so as to respond to a diversity of appe- 
tites, it is none the less true that the American is usually tied to some theological 
party or definite sect or other, so that if he does flatter himself that he is as little 
religious as possible by having reduced his beliefs to a minimum, he has none the 
more become philosophical. 
ABSENCE OF TRADITIONS. 
The American philosophical spirit is not sustained by the traditions of the past as 
it is in our old countries of Europe. Assuredly, in one sense, it is an advantage not 
to be compelled to follow furrows already made and to be free from the incumbrance 
of oppressive hereditary traditions which prescribe the course of our thought. : 
Originality appears to have everything to gain by the absence of established schools, 
and the Americans, who are a young people without a history and but recently 
awakened to the life of thought, seem to realize in actual life that fictitious condi- 
tion of the tabula rasa in which Descartes essayed to place himself when stripping 
his mind of all old opinions he attempted to approach the problems of nature and 
the soul with a reason entirely fresh and freed from prejudices. Still, the inherit- 
ance of long-continued previous labor, even if it leaves the field of thought covered 
with much deadwood, is nevertheless a necessary condition for serious philosophical

development. Philosophical systems can not be improvised; they are not built ina — 
day like a gigantic houso or a colossal bridge. The complicated, refined, and pene- 
trating turn of mind which distinguishes philosophers can only spring from tho 
slow preparations of a progressive evolution. In Enrope how many philosophers 
there are who are only such because they have followed the footsteps and developed 
the thought of some distinguished or eminent thinker whose reputation was estab- 
lished years or eyen centuries ago. From this kind come the “scholasties”—tradi- 
tion has its bad side—who survive long after the disappearance of the head of their 
school, and who too often paralyze all invention and innovating tendencies. But in 
return, thanks to these legacies from the past, the habit of philosophizing has gradu- 
_ally insinuated itself into our minds; numberless suggestions and inspirations come 
to us from those who have struggled with the same problems before us; we are 
rounded with examples and lessons; we live in an atmosphere saturated with 
questionings, hypotheses, problems proposed, and formulated solutions, Al] this is 
wanting in the United States, hence Mr. Stanly Hall observes ‘‘As a nation we are 
not yet old enough to have had time to develop a philosophy.” ® 
  IMITATION OF EUROPEAN PHILOSOPHY. 
The same author continues in the article here quoted:! ‘““We have too much 
curiosity and are too receptive to despair of having one hereafter.” To prepare 
themselves for this event Americans resolutely go abroad for assistance from foreign 
schools. Having no philosophical traditions of their own they go to Europe for 
them. Philosophy is an imported article with them and, it should be added, Ger- 
man philosophy particularly. Our classical French philosophers are generally little 
known; Descartes is the only French writer who is studied in America. Among 
philosophers of the nineteenth century Cousin is cited once or twice in the pro- 
grammes; Auguste Compte is scarcely mentioned and I hardly see any French 
writers besides Janet and Ribot, who are quite widely known. The Germanic influ- 
ence is manifestly preponderating, not only in the domain of psycho-physiologieal 
researches, the success of which in America is not surprising, but also, and this is 
more remarkable, in the higher speculations of the great metaphysicians. Hegel 
and Kant are among the authors who are most read, if not textually, at least in the 
critical expositions which American authors have made of their doctrines, and it is 
astonishing that such a transcendental philosophy could find a place in an industrial 
and business community. ‘Kant is the Julius Cesar and Hegel the Augustus of 
modern philosophy,” says Professor Everett of Harvard. And, again, ‘‘Hegel is 
the sovereign in the world of thought and Fichte in that of life.” The following 
translations of German philosophical classics haye been published at Chicago: 
Kant's Critic of Pure Reason, by Morris; Watson’s Schelling’s Transcendental 
Idealism; Everett’s Fichte’s System of Knowledge; Kedney’s Hegel’s Asthetics; 
Noah Porter’s Kant’s Morals; Morris’s Hegel’s Philosophy of History ; Harris’s Hegel’s 
Logic. Tho programmes show what a large place is given to German thinkers. 
This preference for German philosophy over English philosophy itself, although difii- 
cult to explain fully, seems to be due to several causes. First of all, and it would 
be ungracious not to recognize the fact, it must be attributed to the scientific value 
and power of German philosophic thought, and then to a number of minor reasons. 
When Americans go to Europe to study they hardly ever go to English universities. 
If only for the sake of learning a foreign language, they go to Berlin or Heidelberg 
or Jena, and while learning German they learn the German philosophy. On the 
other hand, it must not be forgotten that German immigrants are the most numerous 
in America, and the saying isnearly true that the market for German books is nearly 
as good in the United States as in Germany itself. There was at one time quite a 
pronounced Hegelian movement at St. Louis, and it was there, it is said, that Dr. 
Harris became acquainted with the philosophy of the pantheistic German. The

Journal of Speculative Philosophy, which is devoted to metaphysics, is published 
at St. Louis, Is not the explanation of this kind of intellectual activily to bo 
found in the fact that in this city of French origin—it was ceded by Louis XV in 
1763—ont of a population of 450,000 inhabitants about 180,000 are German? What- 
ever may be the cause, the fact is incontestable that German influence predominates 
in philosophical matters in the United States, even over English. The latter, how- 
ever, also has its weight. The English psychologists from Locke to Sully are held 
in high esteem. Critical expositions of the doctrines of Stuart Mill and Spencer 
have been published, and scientific instruction is thoroughly impregnated with tho 
evolution theory; Darwin is a la mode, his teachings being reconciled, of course, 
with religion and Christian doctrines. American philosophy is in process of forma- 
tion under these diverse influences of continental philosophy, and what augurs 
favorably for its future is the prominence which is given to its study in the colleges 
and universities. 
BROAD MEANING OF THE TERM PHILOSOPHY. 
It is obvious that the term philosophy has not the same meaning in the United 
States as with us. In some universities, Columbia for instance, it is ynonym for 
the ensemble of literary studies; the philosophical faculty in Germany is a school 
of philology more than philosophy proper. This bread use of the term is pushed 
still further and is applied to scientific studies of all kinds and even to technical. 
Columbia College confers the title of bachelor of philosophy upon candidates who 
have studied only geology and paleontology, analytical and applied chemistry, or fol- 
lowed a course of architecture. In many universities the single degree of doctor of 
philosophy crowns studies of every kind, philological and scientific as well as those 
which are exclusively philosophical. 
  PHILOSOPHY PROPERLY SO CALLED. 
Philosophy proper, understanding by that term the special study of psychology, 
logic, morals, and even metaphysics, is no less in honor in American universities. 
And as far as psychology is concerned, including physiological and experimental 
psychology, for studying which special laboratories are provided, furnished with 
eyery kind of instrument for research, American universities have nothing to envy 
in those of the Old World. Photographs of the different rooms of the psychological 
laboratory at Harvard, to cite only one instance, were shown and much admired at 
Chicago. In America philosophical studies are regarded as peculiarly belonging to 
higher education, and it would seem at first sight as if the intention was to exclude 
them from secondary instruction, but such is not the fact. Philosophy is not 
reserved for graduates alone but helps to form graduates—bachelors of arts and of 
philosophy. It is part of the college curriculum before becoming part of the univer- 
sity course. Nor is it, as with us, reserved for a single class—the last in our plan of 
studies—but is taught in the last two years of the college course to juniors and sen- 
iors, and sometimes to sophomores. At the present timo when the question is being 
discussed in France whether the teaching of philosophy should be retained in the 
lycées or be relegated to the faculties, it will not be uninteresting to consider in 
detail how the master goes in some of the more important institutions of the United 
States. [After giving the programme of Harvard and the report of the experimental 
laboratory, the anthor concludes as follows:] It is not only at Harvard that the 
psychological laboratory is organized. Clark, Johns Hopkins, Yale, Columbia, and 
others have equipped them at great expense. This is one of the distinctive traits 
of the philosophic movement in America. Professor Royce declares that two 
branches of philosophical study have prospered in the United States, one is exper- 
imental psychology and the other the history of philosophy. To this should be 
added, perhaps, the study of social morals, which is certainly carried further in 
American universities than with us, where it is too much neglected. Here is the  
-P-A-G-E-210

course of applied ethics at Clark: The subjects of study are normal and patholog- 
ical forms of human life; criminal anthropology, criminal embryology, the object 
of which is to collect from “all the kingdoms of nature”—i. e., even from animals— 
“the acts which committed by man become criminal.” Then there are divisions 
and subdivisions of anthropometry, craniology, physiognomy, teratology, etc. 
It is, therefore, incontestable that the colleges and universities of America are mak- 
ing praiseworthy efforts to develop for their students an almost complete system 
of instruction in philosophy. From 16 to 20 years the American student can, if 
he wishes, acquire a better idea of philosophy than his comrades of the same age 
in Europe; and these ideas are taken from the most recent authors. There is no 
- reserve of even the most delicate questions. The school youth are placed au 
courant with everything which contemporary innovators are thinking. There is, 
besides, no official doctrine or uniform tendency. Opposite opinions are often met 
with in the same university. It is true that by a general understanding all teach- 
ers show themselves respectful and deferential to religious beliefs. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES, 
We take from M. Compayré’s report on secondary instruction in the United States 
several extracts in which the author brings out features that impressed him as a for- 
eigner and which he was able to criticise, both as a competent observer of great 
experience, and especially as an outsider. In selecting the passages on methods of 
study it has been the aim to take those which treat especially of the subjects that 
conduce to culture rather than those in which the studies that qualify for business 
are handled. M.Compayré begins with general considerations on secondary instruc- 
tion which is given, he says, in high schools, academies, and in colleges. In other 
words, notwithstanding appearances and the intentions of the Americans them- 
selves, who in their defective definition only assign high schools and similar insti- 
tutions to this grade of instruction, American secondary instruction comprises two 
parts and is divided into two periods. On one hand are the publie or private 
schools, which are either common to both sexes (when they are public) or are for 
one sex only, which differ in their programmes and in the duration of their studies, 
and give a course of instruction corresponding nearly to that of our classes of 
grammar (sixth, fifth, and fourth), or of the first year of our secondary modern 
instruction; and on the other hand are the colleges with their traditionary four 
years of freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior classes, which are nearly the equiv- 
alent of the higher classes of the French lycées, and lead to the baccalaureate 
degree, which is obtained on graduation. The Americans, therefore, give, so to 
speak, without knowing it, secondary instruction in their colleges, while they refer 
these institutions to higher and professional instruction. Words do not have the 
same meaning with them as with us. Secondary instruction in their point of view 
only represents an intermediary grade or transition between primary studies and the 
higher instruction of colleges and universities. In France a lycée or a college con- 
sists of a series of progressive classes, in which the same students receive a continu- 
ous instruction, formed on the same principles, which is adapted to a general prep- 
aration for active life or for professional studies. In America secondary instruction 
is made up of pieces or portions, at least of two portions, the high schools and the 
colleges. And in some States, in Massachusetts notably, certain secondary studies, 
that of Latin for example, have been introduced into the grammar schools which 
are the highest grade of primary schools, so that a little secondary instruction is 
found in every grade of instruction without being distinctly organized in any one. 
It is true that in the great majority of colleges the two parts of American secondary 
instruction are found associated or juxtaposed by combining the preparatory depart- 
ments, so called, with the collegiate. Of 384 colleges and universities enumerated in 
the statistics for 1888-89 there were only 40 which did not have both a preparatory 
and collegiate department. It is to be remarked that the colleges without a pre- 
paratory department are found principally in the Eastern States—New York and 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 1169 
Massachusetts—where pedagogical organization is most complete, from which it may 
be inferred that the separation is regarded as an advance, and that where the high 
schools are numerous and well organized the colleges do not concern themselves with 
preparatory instruction. 
The Americans themselves are the first to recognize the imperfections of their sys- 
tem of secondary instruction, but are not, perhaps, so sensible as we would be of 
the incoherence of an organization which intrusts to different institutions the suc- 
cessive development of one uninterrupted grade of instruction. One inconvenience 
which results from this arrangement is that a majority of the high-school pupils do 
not pursue their studies further. While in France nearly all the pupils of the 
quatri®me continue their studies until the end of the secondary grade, hardly a sixth 
of the population of the American high schools pass on into the colleges. Possibly 
the Americans do not yet realize sufficiently what confusion there is in the manage- 
ment of their high schools, which are half secondary and half superior primary 
institutions, by the simultaneous attendance of pupils who do not intend to pass 
beyond the high schools and those who are preparing for college and the uniyersi- 
ties. Think what disorder, what a pedagogical medley would result if all the gram- 
mar classes were suddenly suppressed in our colleges and lycées and the superior 
primary schools were to take their place, and, by a partial transformation, through 
the introduction of Latin and Greek into their course, were to invite to their hetero- 
geneous lessons—half French and scientific, half classic and Greek-Latin—an indis- 
criminate crowd of pupils, some of whom intended to take the humanities while 
the others expected no more than simple primary instruction of a superior grade. 
The evil from which American secondary instruction suffers has an historical expla- 
nation. When their existence began in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 
there was no intermediate grade between the primary schools and the colleges and 
universities. Later the State, or, to speak more correctly, the States, took in hand 
the organization of the primary schools, which became the common schools, but 
they left the colleges and universities alone as having an independent life of their 
own, Then the directing powers proceeded to intercalate an intermediate class of 
institutions between the common schools and the private colleges, which should unite 
the two and also be public schools. This was the origin of the high schools, and as 
they were established at the public expense, it was necessary to take into account 
both their adaptation to the wants of the majority of the citizens who do not wish 
their children to have a complete course of secondary instruction, and also the needs 
of a small number of scholars who desire to enter college. 
OPINION OF DR. HARRIS. 
But if American pedagogues do not sufficiently apprehend the vices of the general 
organization of their secondary instruction, which is, so to say, composite and 
derived from different sources, and consequently wanting in order and unity, they 
do not hesitate to declare themselves on other points of their inferiority. The proof 
is that the question of the reform of secondary instruction has become more 
than any other the order of the day. In 1892 a committee was appointed under the 
auspices of the National Educational Association to consider the improvements 
which might be introduced into the courses of study in the high schools and acade- 
mies. This committee published a long report, of which Dr. Harris declared that 
it was the most important pedagogical document ever published in the United 
States. In his letter of introduction to this report Dr. Harris says that it is admitted 
by all that the most defective part of education in the United States is that which 
is given in secondary schools. He points out the discrepancies which exist in the 
regulations, plans of study, selection of subjects, and the different importance which 
is attached to the latter in different institutions. He speaks of the uncertainty of 
opinion upon the definition of secondary instruction and the unfortunate conse- 
quences which have followed this state of confusion, both on the part of the ele- 
mentary schools, which can not tell on what condition their pupils will be admitted
-P-A-G-E-212
1170 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
to the high schools, and on the part of the colleges and universities because the 
pupils of the high schools are not well qualified to enter them. All of which shows 
that American pedagogy, having cut secondary instruction in two, finds it difficult 
to fit the two pieces together. 
OPINION OF PRESIDENT ELIOT, OF HARVARD. 
  It is interesting to observe that this eminent educator decides in favor of our 
Freneh system of secondary instruction; and it is especially to be noted that in reach- 
ing his conclusions, which are so favorable to European methods, President Eliot 
makes his comparison between the common and universal methods of our 300 lyeées 
and colleges, and what is a rare and exceptional type in the United States, the pro- 
gramme of the Boston grammar schools and the Latin school. He says, ‘The French 
programme is decidedly more substantial, that is to say, it calls for greater exertion 
on the part of the pupil than the American, introduces the children earlier to serious 
subjects, and is generally more interesting and stimulating to the intelligence.” In 
Franco the child of 8 studies a foreign language, English or German; in America he 
does not begin such studies before the age of 13, when the most propitious time for 
learning foreign languages is past. Then, at 8 years the French boy begins his his- 
tory, which is presented in a peculiarly attractive and instructive form, that of the 
lives of great men. The American boy does not begin history until he is 13, and he 
is launched at the start into Greek history. On the other hand, the American pro- 
gramme gives three times as much arithmetic as the French, and yet it does not 
appear that the French are less skillful in handling figures than the Americans. 
The French scholar also begins natural history earlier than the American, and the 
subject is better presented to him. The French scholars generally are of the age 
prescribed by their plans of study, which is not the case with Americans. At the 
Boston Latin School, while the plan of studies is designed for pupils from 11 to 16, 
the real age is from 13 to 18. 
So far we have repeated what the Americans themselves have criticised in their 
secondary instruction, but our study will show, on the other hand, whatever of. good 
thero is in tho efforts already made and the results obtained. In the first place, there 
is the long duration of secondary studies, during which young people of both sexes 
receive a liberal education, designed to be an instrument of general culture for 
developing the faculties and character. Then the comparatively late period of com- 
pleting secondary studies—2i or 22 years of age—is a good rather than an evil, 
and it seems evident that a complete education, intimate and profound, which must 
penetrate into the marrow of the souls, subjected for a long time to the intellectual 
and moral discipline of its liberalizing influence, must result from such a long-con- 
tinued course of training, lasting even to majority. Why say anything of what 
everyone knows already—the material conditions under which American secondary 
instruction is developed? Eyerywhere sumptuous high schools, like pala are 
established in the cities within reach of all the children of the people, while, by way 
of contrast, the colleges are situated in the country in the midst of verdure and 
groves, far from the unhealthy excitement of the feverish life of cities, This is found 
in every State of the Union. Everywhere are comfortable, sometimes elegant, and 
at any rate spacions, buildings, and often in the colleges there are rich libraries of 
50,000 volumes like those of universities; besides, also, laboratories and museums 
which offer the greatest resources for personal research or artistic culture. The high 
schools have no dormitories and their pupils live at home, but even in the colleges 
where the contrary system prevails there is the greatest freedom. While offering 
the students the advantages of the common refectory and. rooms in the dormitories, 
these college authorities allow them freedom to live in private houses if they prefer 
to doso, But those who sleep and board in the college are nevertheless treated like 
day pupils (externes) or, as it is expressly stated, like gentlemen, and they are con- 
stantly reminded that they are responsible for their own actions. Sometimes even 
      
   
-P-A-G-E-213
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. SSE 
collegians help to form a council of administration, which acts with tho official 
authorities in maintaining order and decorum. Education of the character is the 
principal care, and to this end associations and societies of all kinds are encour- 
aged, not only athletic clubs, but literary societies, where the young men practice 
debates and learn to conquer the timidity of their age and speak in public. There 
are also musical and singing societies, and in some institutions there is a general 
mecting of professors and students every week, in which, under the form of lectures, 
readings, etc., the effort is made to develop elevated sentiments and cultivate the 
minds of the scholastic community. 
EXTENT AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE PROGRAMMES. 
What strikes us especially in this investigation is the organization of intellectual 
training in the United States, comprising both the extent and richness of the pro- 
grammes and the flexibility and elasticity of the studies. Strictly speaking, the 
authorities in charge of American secondary instruction do not themselves choose 
the different subjects of which their programmes are composed; it is rather the pupils 
who make the choice. They are offered a great variety of studies which, taken 
together, would make a veritable encyclopedia; the scholar who can not take all 
decides in favor of such and such a study, according to his tastes and aptitudes. It 
is like a richly served table, supplied with dishes of every kind, which is set before 
the student, who sits where he pleases and helps himself to whatever he wishes, 
How far removed from the uniform and tyrannical regulations of secondary instrue- 
tion in Europe is all this. The general rule in America is for each student to choose 
forhimself. The road is pointed out to him—in fact, two or three—at the end of which 
a Cifferent baccalaureate awaits him. But even to reach the samo end and attain 
the same degreo students can take one route or another, as best suits them; can con- 
centrate their attention on some subjects and neglect others, and, in short, act in 
full freedom, and consequently werk with more spirit and succeed better in studies 
which are voluntarily undertaken and which they have chosen in preference to 
others. We do not hesitate to say that the system of elective courses which is more 
or less practiced in the secondary schools of America confers upon these schools a 
character of vitality to which our lycées can not pretend, because our pupils are all 
constrained to follow the same course of instruction, without regard to their different 
intellectual capacities or social destinations. And it is to be noted that this liberty 
of choice allowed to young Americans does not carry with it, as might perhaps be 
expected, an abandonment of classical studies, for the Latinists are quite numerous, ~ 
Greek-Latin instruction, too, is in esteem and holds its place through public opinion, 
nursed by the leaders of education, who, in spite of the practical and utilitarian 
tendencies of a commercial and industrial nation, understand the value of the old 
humanities and, so far from consenting to sacrifice the classics upon the altar of 
science and practical arts, defend and maintain them with as much conviction and 
enthusiasm as the humanists of the old world. 
The report of the committee of ten, appointed by the National Educational Associa- 
tion makes it evident that there is a tendency to give a large place to what may be 
called modern instruction—the physical sciences, natural history, geography, his- 
tory, and modern languages—in opposition to the preponderance hitherto given to 
el ul instruction—Greek, Latin, and mathematics—which Americans call ‘old 
and venerable subjects.” There is no danger of breaking with Latin. If there is 
anyone who would like to ‘deliver us from the Greeks and Romans,” as there are in 
France, it would seem as if there would be no hope for him in America. The Ameri- 
cans manifest almost a religious veneration for the classical humanities; but they 
also feel, and very sensibly, the need of strengthening the course of positive and sci- 
entific studies. 
Of the diverse subjects of study in the high schools and colleges we can only give 
M. Compayré’s remarks on Latin, Greek, and history. He says: ‘‘ Despite the move- 
ment which is making itself felt in America, as everywhere else, toward modern 
     
-P-A-G-E-214
  
  1172 j EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
and scientific studies, Latin has remained in practice one of the fundamental studies 
of the high school. And in theory nearly everyone recognizes its importance as an 
instrument of intellectual discipline. What strikes us at first is the late period (i. ¢., 
about 15 years of age) at which, according to the traditionary usages of Europe, 
American scholars begin Latin. The two essential points in the study of Latin as 
itis understood in secondary schools of the United States are reading the Latin 
text and Latin composition. The latter is only used because it is regarded as an 
excellent means of penetrating the secrets of Latin construction more thoroughly, 
learning the meaning of the words and remembering the forms and inflections of 
nouns and verbs; of giving, in short, a better understanding of the rules of syntax. 
Now this is what one must know in order to be able to read a Latin author easily, 
which is the object sought. The pupil is therefore exercised in composition not in 
order that he may acquire the useless talent of writing Latin, but in order that he 
may surmount all the difficulties which he meets in reading the text. It can not be 
denied that Latin and Greek studies in America are conceived in a somewhat narrow 
spirit. Ido not dispute the advantages which may follow from studying only one 
author and, only one work of that author, [The programmes show that Cwsar’s 
Gallic Wars and the Aineid are the only Latin books studied the first two years in 
the high schools.] It was the method of the middle ages when there was hardly 
more than one book studied in each faculty. But how much more liberal is the 
modern method which introduces the scholar to all the productions of Greek and 
Latin genius, and opens to him the treasures of classical antiquity! Is there not 
danger that by restricting as much as it does the list of authors to be read and 
explained, American pedagogy may transform a rich study, which is fertile above 
all others, into a mechanical and sterile routine? The conference has, however, 
declared that the selection of Cwsar’s Gallic Wars is most unfortunate, as the work is 
too difficult for beginners and uninteresting from its too exclusively military char- 
acter. Its vocabulary also is limited by the nature of the subject.” 
The committee of ten also points out that Latin is not to be studied merely to 
understand the meaning of words and the form of construction, but also in order 
to enter into the spirit of Latin literature, and so gain an idea of the thoughts and 
sentiments of a people who have contributed so largely to the civilization of the 
present day. Accordingly they recommend certain works of history and criticism 
in which modern authors treat of Cicero, Cesar, and Virgil, and their times. 
To sum up, the features which distinguish elementary instruction in Latin in the 
high schools of America are, the beginner is brought in contact with difficult authors 
sooner than with us; composition is considered more useful and is more generally 
practiced than [written] translation; grammar is only taught as an adjunct to the 
explanation of the text or when translating English into Latin; the number of 
authors studied is very limited, and, what is remarkable in a land of absolute free- 
dom of choice, the same authors are used everywhere. 
GREEK. 
The number of scholars in the high schools who take Greek is very small, not over 
3 per cent of the school population, and of this small number Massachusetts alone 
has one-third; and this small number does not carry its study very far. The stu- 
dents of Greek are those who are fitting for college, and the council of ten does not © 
deem it desirable that the study should be extended. While the Greek classes of 
the high school correspond in degree pretty nearly to those in which French boys 
begin their Greek, the age of the American scholars is greater than that of the 
French by three years. The books studied are the Anabasis and the Iliad, and the 
conference has protested against the exclusive use of the Anabasis as not sufficiently 
important. The beauties of Homer are not celebrated in France with more convic- 
tion than in America, as shown in these words: ‘The prospect of reading Homer is 
no small inducement to pupils to study Greek; in schools where children have been

HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 1173 
encouraged to read translations of Homer the number beginning Greek has been con- 
siderably increased. The Homeric poems appeal to the pupil’s imagination:and 
arouse his interest in the life and thoughts of the Greeks,” and the ‘Odyssey deals 
with fairyland, enchantment, and human effort.” 
American teachers hardly recommend written translations of Greek any more than 
of Latin, but they place great stress on the merits of oral or written composition. 
These exercises are limited to the ideas and words of the lesson of the day, contained. 
in the texts studied in the class room. The exercises of Greek composition are con- 
sidered necessary to a complete understanding of the texts studied in the class. The 
object assigned to the study of Greek by the conference is thus defined: It is to teach 
the language of classic Attic prose by making the Attic grammar ‘understood and by 
reading Attic texts, but the object is also to excite a taste for Greek literature by 
reading Homer. Reading, and cursory reading at that, is the great instrument for 
the acquisition of languages, according to the Americans. This reading is of course 
accompanied by explanations on questions of geography, history, and mythology sug- 
gested by the text, and these explanations are expressly recommended. Nevertheless, 
the progress of the student is measured by the number of lines or verses he has read. 
One teacher felicitates himself on his success and judges it by the fact that a few 
years ago his students only read three books of Homer, while later they could read 
five, and still later eight, and he hopes to go still further with them. The knowledge 
of grammar, in other words, is in no sense the final object of the study of Greek, but 
is only a means for reaching the real end, which is facility in reading a Greek text, 
and as the student does not begin Greek until he has studied Latin for a year or - 
more he is forced to rely upon his knowledge of Latin syntax to understand more 
easily and quickly that of the Greek. 
[The author cites authorities to show that the same idea prevails in teaching 
modern langages. The teachers are recommended to confine themselves to instruct- 
ing their pupils to read French and German readily without requiring them to write 
_ or speak those languages. | 
HISTORY IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The study of history has not obtained the importance it deserves in the secondary 
schools of the United States, only 27.31 per cent of the attendants of these schools 
having taken it in 1889-90. In later programmes it also occupies a subordinate place. 
In the high schools of Chicago, for example, there is no history until the third year, 
when general history appears. It then gives place to other studies. There is no 
ancient history for students of the general course and no national or modern history 
for students of the classical course, nor do the young scholars have any instruction in 
history before entering the high schools, and none in the grammar schools until the 
third year, when the history of the United States until the Administration of Wash- 
ington is introduced. The child is therefore 13 years old before he learns the history 
of his own country. Is this not because the practical American, absorbed by his 
care for the present and future, is indifferent to a past which he disdains and can 
not see, the use of studying the Old World? The committee has made a remarkable 
report on this subject. Rarely have the importance of historical study and the 
influence which it exerts on the development of the mind, when properly directed, 
been better defined. 
MORAL EDUCATION IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS. 
These schools are attended by scholars who only come a few hours a day to follow 
a certain course of study, and they would seem to be above all and almost exclusively 
schools of intellectual education. Are they schools of moral education as well? 
The Americans say that they are and that they contribute with the church and fam- 
ily to form the morale of the young from 14 to 18 years of age. It is a universal tes- 
timony, says Mr. Huling, that the senior classes of the high schools show a manifest 
   
-P-A-G-E-216
1174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
moral improvement over the lowest classes. They have developed in reflection, 
conscience, and propriety. They have a sense of responsibility and duty, are less 
egotistical, and more devoted to goodness for itself. There is less lying and flirting, 
and a general progress in dignity and self-respect. Doubtless this moral progress is 
in the first place the natural effect of mental work. But the studies are not allowed 
to exercise their moral effect unaided. Every opportunity that instruction in history 
' and literature can afford for forming the character is utilized, and advantage is 
taken of public exercises and religious or other lectures to impress the minds of the 
students with a high ideal of morality. Use is also made of private conversations 
adapted to the wants of individuals, and even the aid of parents is invoked to the 
the same end. : 
LATIN AND GREEK IN THE COLLEGES. 
We find nearly the same authors studied in all the colleges. Except Virgil, which 
is a book of the high school, nearly.all the great Latin prose writers or poets figure 
in the programmes. The aim of tho instruction given is manifestly to teach the str- 
dents to read Latin easily, and also to use the study of the text as a means to know 
the history of the manners and arts of the Roman people. The programmes of Greek 
instruction lead us to the same conclusions. [Gives Greek programmes of Oberlin, 
Amherst, and Williams.] The Greek authors studied in American colleges, it will bo 
seen, are nearly the same as those used in France. The question is, are they studied 
in the same spirit? They are, assuredly, in some points. The Amhurst programme 
says: ‘It is our aim to give the student an exact appreciation of the style and 
thought of the Greek writers and open to him the treasures of wisdom and knowl- 
edge which their works contain.” But what especially characterizes the American 
Hellenists is that they try to have a good deal of Greek read and read rapidly. Thus, 
at Oberlin, it is specified in the programme that ‘‘all the comedies of Aristophanes 
will be read” except certain ones which, for obvious reasons, are read only in part. 
Greek composition, like Latin, is not practiced after the freshman year, nor is Greek 
[written] translation regarded with favor any more than Latin. Cursive explana- 
tion of the text is the rule. We must add that the study of the Greek language 
js combined with that of the literature, institutions, manners, and art of Greece. 
At Williams, for example, while reading the Odyssey the principal Homeric ques- 
tions are discussed, and while translating Lysias, the political and social circum- 
stances alluded to in his orations are explained. The use of dictionaries of Greek 
antiquities is recommended, and Athens and Olympia are studied from the topograph- 
jeal and archeological point of view. In a word, the study of Greek is not limited 
to a dry apprenticeship to the language alone, but it penetrates into the genius of 
the Greek race and attempts to know its thought and life, and it is declared that the 
knowledge of Greek is an inestimable discipline for the mind and is at the same 
time an indispensable condition of the knowledge both of ancient and modern 
Janguages and literature ;

CHAPTER XXIII. 
MENTAL FATIGUE IN SCHOOL. 
The Annual Report of 1894-95 contains an article under the caption “Mental Fatigue 
in School” (see Part I, pp. 449-460), in which the views of leading German and other 
European educators and investigators are stated. It contains quotations from Rich- 
ter, Krepelin, Mosso, Burgerstein, and others, and attempts to represent the peda- 
gogical sido of the question. The subject of mental fatiguo has occupied English 
and American educators and a very interesting discussion has ensued, the sam and 
substance of which is here sketched. 
Prof. M. V. O’Shea, of the School of Pedagogy in the University of Buffalo, says 
in Intelligence, after defining mental fatigue from a physiological standpoint: 
“Many nervous diseases have their origin in the schoolroom, and are due in part 
to the ignorance and neglect of teachers in their watchfulness of individual children; 
we say in part, for certainly the unhygienic conditions of the ordinary schoolroom 
aro far more blamable than the teacher who, while charged with grave responsibili- 
ties, yet must work under the conditions impesed upon her. 
“The practical questions for the teacher in the study of this subject are, What 
conditions produce fatigue more easily in some children than in others? What are 
the signs by which the existence or approach of this state may be detected? In the 
first place, it should be understood that fatigue means simply that the nervous sys- 
tem has been depleted of energy which can be restored through proper nutrition or 
rest. But, if one should speak correctly, rest and nutrition mean one and the same 
thing, for they both imply the filling up and enlivening of nerve cells by means of 
proper elements from the blood. In sleep this process of repair goes on more rapidly 
than waste, provided there are sufficient nourishing properties in the blood, for then 
there is, or should be, little effort to use up nerve force; and by mental effort must 
be understood not simply intellectual activity, but all emotional and volitional 
activity as well, If, then, fatigue implies a lack of nutrition of the nerve centers, 
from w chatever cause produced, it is necessary for the teacher to know, in the first 
place, whether individual pupils, in whom she may find signs of undue nervousness, 
partake regularly of a sufficient amount of proper food, and whether there is assimi- 
lation of the essential elements of the food, even if there is the right amount and 
kind. It may be easy enough to find out about the quality and quantity of food, but 
itis not so easy, of course, to determine what each individual appropriates there- 
from, and perhaps this can only be found out by the advice of physicians. But how- 
ever the problem be met, it is an extremely important matter, and one which will 
explain the restlessness and apparent stupidity of at least some pupils in the 
classroom.” 
After citing some examples observed in the schools of Bufialo, the writer goes on 
to say: 
“Tt will not be necessary to multiply examples, for in all likelihood every teacher 
can recall a number in her own experience. But there are other conditions besides 
improper food that may cause fatigue easily in individual children. A pupil who is 
1175

recovering from some wasting disease needs all the energies of the body for the res- 
toration of physical strength, and he is in no wise able to do as much as may be 
required of those in a state of health. Let teachers review their own experiences, 
and recall if some temporary illness even has not ineapacitated them for the work 
which they would ordinarily be able to do easily. Then, too, the kind and amount 
of bodily exercise which pupils have, determines the readiness with which they 
become fatigued. After a pupil has been engaged in intellectual work for an hour 
or more, signs of fatigue become apparent, unless he be given opportunity for phys- 
ical exercise 80 as to quicken circulation and throw fresh pure blood to the brain 
centers. Every observing teacher must have noticed in this connection the tendency 
of children to grow restless and irritable, with inability to think clearly and con- 
secutively, unless they are permitted frequent periods of physical relaxation. 
‘*But it seems not to be sufficiently appreciated that these periods must be frequent 
with quite young children, and must occur at least every hour with older ones, 
Tests made by the writer in the schools of Buffalo, show that with pupils of 11 or 
12, thirty-five minutes of continuous application at any one task shows marked evi- 
dences of fatigue in the number of errors made in their work, the apparent greater 
carelessness in writing, the uncontrolled movements of the body, and the inability 
to work rapidly. With younger children this period is considerably less, and wise 
teachers always give a moment or two for some physical exercise between different 
recitations. It may be interesting and instructive for teachers to test pupils upon 
this point. Ask them to write a few sentences at the beginning of the morning’s 
work when they are fresh and rested, and then after an hour’s work have them 
repeated; and so have three or four writings made during the day, and observe 
whether there is any difference in the smoothness and neatness of the different 
specimens, and the care and rapidity with which they are written. 
“A simple test, but yet an efficient one, will be to have pupils bisect or trisect 
lines of from 2 to 3 inches long, first when pupils are fresh, and then after an hour’s 
work, or at the close of the day’s session, noticing whether there is marked differ- 
ence in the accuracy with which the divisions are made. Other simple experiments 
may be made, such as testing the ability to discriminate colors, tones, slight differ- 
ences in pitch, and so on. When the nervous system is in a state of fatigue from 
overstrain or other reason the pupil can not respond so keenly and accurately to 
impressions through any of the senses. Perhaps many teachers have noticed this in 
the apparent greater carelessness of pupils to what is said at the close of the day 
than in the morning or immediately after recess. While the cause may sometimes 
be due to restlessness and the anxiety of pupils to get out of doors, still it is often 
caused by actual inability to discriminate sound as keenly when pupils are fatigued 
after several hours’ work. ‘ 
“Tt has been pointed out that temperament is an important element in determining 
what may be expected of a pupil and how he should be treated, and it is especially 
true in regard to this matter of fatigue. Children of a neurotic type may become 
fatigued in the prosecution of work which the average individual can do with per- 
fect ease and impunity; and while it will be impossible (and undesirable also) for 
the teacher to treat types entirely different from each other under the conditions 
which exist in the schoolroom, still she can and should make some allowances, and. 
modify her demands to some extent according as special cases require. In extreme 
instances she may be of incalculable aid to a pupil by leading the parents to under- 
stand and care for the child properly at home, and if he needs the advice and diree- 
tion of a physician to secure it for him. 
“Finally it should be understood by teachers that, contrary to common opinion, 
boys before the age of 12 or thereabouts become fatigued over the work of the school 
more easily than girls; and this is to be accounted for probably by the greater im- 
pulsiveness of boys. It is unquestionably true that boys have more physical strength 
than girls, but they are not so controlled in its use, but more passionately eager and 
impatient. Dr, Warner, of London, found, after an examination of 100,000 children, 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  MENTAL FATIGUE IN SCHOOL. THe 
that the average school girl is a more healthy being than the average school boy; 
and we have probably been wrong in supposing that boys can endure everything 
without injury, and need no looking after on the part of the teacher. Let anyone 
observe in the schoolroom the comparative abilities of boys and girls at 8 or 9 years 
of age to do the work of any class. Notice whether, if the boys seem to gain results 
a little quicker, they can continue as long at any one task. Observe especially if 
after continuous application for twenty-five or thirty minutes boys’ work becomes 
more careless and more full of errors than that of the girls.” 
If we apply the principle of control of physical movement by definite brain cen- 
ters to the interpretation of signs of fatigue in the class room, we have something 
to lead us to observations valuable beyond doubt. No one has put this subject in 
such agreeable form for teachers as Dr. Francis Warner, of London, who indicates 
other signs also. It will be best to quote his own words, showing conditions of 
fatigue and the way of detecting them: 
“Fatigue is the name given to the condition which follows exertion. It is remoy- 
able by rest, but if not removed passes on to exhaustion. Among the visible signs 
indicating fatigue in the individual I may mention the slight amount of force ex- 
pended in movement, and the smaller number of movements. “There appears to be 
a lessened total of force passing from the nerve centers to the muscles. There seems 
to be general evidence that lessened force in the brain is apt to be followed by asym- 
metry of action, the two sides not acting equally; the result is asymmetry of pos- 
ture and unequal movements in the two sides of the body. Nerve centers when weak- 
ened by overwork are often irritable, giving out force on the slightest stimulation, 
or upon no apparent stimulation. As you look at the child you see too little move- 
ment, or occasional jerky movements not controlled by cireumstances. The balance 
of the trunk and head is probably asymmetrical—probably the head is inclined to 
one side. The arms, when extended, may not be on the same level, the feeble hand 
or other weak posture is seen, possibly with some finger twitching. The eye move- 
ments may not be distinctly fixed by the sight of objects around; the face is less lively 
looking, less mobile; possibly there may be fullness under either eye, owing to a 
relaxed state of the circular muscles of the eyelids. You will, of course, note the 
circumstances under which those observations are made, that you may determine the 
cause and remove it. In the state of fatigue the body comes more directly under 
the influence of gravity; if work be persisted in by the student, the body should 
be supported, as by an appropriate chair; food may be needed. 
“If expenditure of force continues after fatigue has existed for some time, the 
more severe condition termed ‘exhaustion’ supervenes. In the movements that occur 
there is very little force, and they are not well under the control of the senses; the 
balance of the body is asymmetrical—the head may hang too far forward, and to 
one or the other side; the spine may be too much bent forward in the loins (lordo- 
sis), and bent back in the higher part. Putting the hand forward causes much 
alteration of the balance of the trunk; the feeble hand or the nervous hand may 
be observed probably with finger twitchings in flexion or extension or in lateral 
movements. The eyes probably wander, the face is motionless and pale; often the 
under eyelids are full and puffy. The face may be elongated from relaxation of its 
muscles and slight falling of the jaw, the mouth being partially open. The ordi- 
nary movements of expression are not excited by the ordinary stimuli, and such 
movements as do occur are slow and delayed. The face may have a dull appearance 
from ill nutrition and shrinking of its fat, and the eyes may be slightly shrunken 
from the same cause. 
“A stronger stimulus than usual is requiréd to induce the child to hold out his 
hand. The feeble or nervous posture is then seen with ill balance of the head and 
spine. Sighing and yawning are spasmodic movements common in exhaustion. 
Speech may be slow, or the voice altered in tone, or even lost. In exhaustion we 
often find that the nerve centers are too ready to send out currents to the muscles 
   
-P-A-G-E-220
  1178 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
without being stimulated, and time and quantity of the action of the nerve cen- 
ters are not determined by cireumstances around. A slight noise may make him 
start; on the other hand, speaking to him may not be followed by a ready reply; the 
useless starting moyement is in excess; the reply we want can not be obtained from 
him. You will find it difficult in this condition of the child’s brain to form any new 
organization for movements, or to get him to learn anything. Further, there may be 
a tendency to an action the opposite to that usual under the cireumstances—an 
inverted ratio of action among the centers. When irritable, the child may turn his 
head away from the sight of objects at which in happier moments he would look. 
You say ho turns his head away from his dinner because he is irritable and peevish; 
his nerve centers turn his head away at the sight of food because they are not in 
good acting order. Reflex action is usually in excess in the state of exhaustion; 
movements upon touch are excessive, hence it is not well to try to impress the child 
much when in such a condition. 
“Tho condition termed ‘irritability’ in a child is usually an accompaniment of 
fatigue or exhaustion. Such astate is indicated by the following sign: A slight noise 
makes him start. This is a reflex movement in excess—a reflex that does not occur 
in the more perfect condition of health under such stimulus. In irritability other 
stimuli besides sound may produce excessive reflex action; a touch upon the shoulder 
is followed by sudden movement. Not only is the amount of reflex movement 
. excessive and out of due proportion to the stimulus, but the kind of movement may 
differ from that usually following such a stimulus under better conditions of the 
nerve system. <A child 3 years of age, when irritable, may turn away his head from 
a familiar object such as usually attracts his attention, or from the sight of his food 
and say ‘No, no!’ Here the sight of the object, instead of causing a reflex movement 
of head, eyes, and hand toward the object, moves them all from it. The irritability 
of the nerve centers is indicated by movements in the opposite direction from that 
which the same stimulus would produce in a more restful condition. Besides these 
reflex signs, we find the voice altered. When spoken to, he may answer sharply; the 
motor force generally is lessened and irregular in kind; twitching, irregular moye- 
ments like the spontaneous movements of younger children are not uncommon in 
this state of irritability, which seems to be a condition of reduction to a more infan- 
tile state. Nervous children often show marked signs of irritability; the spontane- 
ous postures assumed are those of fatigue, with the addition of slight irregular 
twitching movements, This irritability may result from exhaustion, and, like explo- 
sions of passions, it may lead to exhaustion. Abnormal conditions in the body, par- 
ticularly in the stomach, may render the child irritable; so may fever or other illness, 
The child that is irritable may require rest and feeding. Inquire as to his sleeping, 
and do not try to produce much impression on him by talking while he is in this state. 
“Fatigue and exhaustion are best removed by feeding and rest. Restfulness 
implies recreation of the parts fatigued or exhausted; the nerve centers are the parts 
most needing rest after work, and they do not all get equally tired. One occupation 
exercises or tires one set of centers; a different occupation may exercise another set 
of centers and allow the first set to rest; reading may be followed by writing, and 
this exercise by singing, which employs the respiratory nerve apparatus. On the 
other hand, the centers concerned in mental work may alone be fatigued, as indi- 
eated by the eyes not being readily drawn to the work, and by uncertainty to reply 
to questions and delay in replying. The nerve-muscular apparatus concerned in 
active play may be found in good order when the lesson is finished. 
“Complete rest is needed at all times; the whole of the body and brain at times 
requires to go through a period of qutet nutrition, without any expenditure of force 
that can be ayoided. This may best be effected after feeding, when the blood is 
rich with nutritive material. The signs of restfulness are negative—the absence of 
movement, as in sleep; indeed, this state differs from sleep only—we will not say in 
the retention of consciousness, but in the signs of impressionability; the child when 
   
-P-A-G-E-221
  MENTAL FATIGUE IN SCHOOL. TLE 
resting speaks if spoken to, and is impressed with what he sees and hears. To pro- 
cure complete rest, let the sources of impressions be removed from around him. It 
has been said that the signs of rest are negative; that rest has been effected is known 
by subsequent activity and increase of spontaneous action, greater capacity for the 
proper functions of the brain, and the removal of all signs of fatigue. 
“Rest is a condition of nutrition leading to the signs of recreation indicated by 
subsequent activity. The most essential element in the expression of the condition 
of rest is the subsequent activity. During rest there is stillimpressionability which 
affords a distinguishing character between simple rest and sleep; arising out of this 
we have the fact that in rest uncomplicated by sleep the eyelids usually remain 
open. 
“(One of the special characters of rest is the absence of movement, although 
impressionability is retained. Rest is usually preceded by fatigue, and it is followed 
by activity; the sequential signs of recreation and activity indicate that during 
the period in which movement was absent there was rest. Rest is expressed by the 
present signs of rest, followed by the signs of recreation and activity. 
“ Asa matter of interest it may be noted that forces, such as the sound of sooth- 
ing music, may affect movements. Music may cause a man to keep quiet.and rest. 
“In contradistinction to the state of rest we have activity. The condition of 
activity is indicated by actions, i. e., movements. In activity with strength the 
moyenents are probably fewer in number than in the state of irritability, and the 
kinds of movements differ in the two conditions. 
“One sign of healthy activity is a quick response to movement upon stimulation. 
For example, the movement quickly follows upon the sight of the object or on hear- 
ing a sound. If such movements are looked upon as reflex actions, the quick and 
ready answer is a reflex series of movements when the period of latency is short; 
this, of course, implies also that impressionability is good. 
“The necessity for alteration of activity and rest in training young people arises 
from the fact that each is necessary to aid the nutrition, growth, and development of 
the body and brain. 
“The signs of nutrition are so important that, although the subject has been 
touched upon, I must speak of it here again. A well-nourished body has a weight 
and height equal to that of the average for the age; the proportions of the various 
parts are the normal; the skin is of healthy color, and the tissues beneath it are firm; 
the face is full and bright. A body thus well nourished is not necessarily possessed 
of a well-nourished brain; a body badly nourished is probably never possessed of a 
brain well nourished, for this, of all parts of the body, suffers first in conditions of 
depression. Thestate of the brain must be observed indepéndently of the rest of the 
body of which it is a part: look to the various signs of brain action as they have 
been described. When brain action is defective, observe how impressions are pro- 
duced upon it by sights and sounds. It may not be sufficiently stimulated by the 
events of daily life, and it may need special training. 
“Nutrition may be expressed by (1) form of growth and (2). by motion, which is 
due to nutrition. 
“ As evidence that motor signs, or movements and the results of movements, may 
express nutrition, let us examine a few examples. 
“1, In an ill-nourished infant spontaneous movement is much lessened, or the child 
may lie almost motionless, instead of being constantly full of movement while 
awake, The return to spontaneous movement is a sign of the improved nutrition. 
“2, In a man, after a severe illness, such as a fever, the tone of the voice is usually 
altered so that we can no longer recognize the individual by his voice. This motor 
sign, as well as the worn countenance, indicates the man’s lowered nutrition. 
Returning health is shown by the patient ‘looking like himself’ and recovering his 
~ old voice. : 
“3, In achild 7 years old emaciation and ill nutrition, indicated by loss of weight,
-P-A-G-E-222
    1180 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
may be accompanied by St. Vitus’s dance or by finger twitching, which disappears 
when weight increases and nutrition is improved. 
“4, A strong, well-nourished man is less fidgety than a weak one. z 
“Now, as to the expression of nutrition by form and growth, proportions of growth 
often indicate conditions of nutrition. Let me describe a typical example of a 
neryous child. Reports may be made of a child that he sleeps badly, talks at night, 
grinds his teeth, emaciates, although there is no disease of any of the organs, often 
suffers from headache, and is irritable, though quick in mind and affectionate. Let 
such a child stand up, and observe him. As to conditions of growth, defects of pro- 
portional development are commonly seen. The form and make of the head and the 
features, as well as the character of the skin, may be good. ‘The height of the child, 
in relation to circumference or to weight, is defective; the child is too tall and too 
thin; either fat or muscle or both may be defective in quantity. The emaciation 
may be unequally distributed. Often it is less in the face than in the limbs and 
trunk. = 
“Now, as to the motor signs, indicating the state of the nerve system. Let the 
hands be held out with the palms downward and the fingers spread. The left upper 
extremity is probably at a lower level than the right. ‘The nervous hand’ is seen on 
either side, perhaps marked on the left. There may be finger twitching, separate 
digits moving in flexion and extension or laterally. The head is slightly flexed, with 
some inclination and rotation, usually to the right. The spine is arched too much 
forward in the loins, often with inequality in the level of the shoulders, and slight 
lateral curvature. The face as a whole is too immobile, although there may be some 
overaction of the muscles, widening the mouth on one or on both sides. The eyes 
move much, mostly in the horizontal direction, these movements not being fully 
controlled by the sight and sounds of objects around, except under strong stimula- 
tion. The tongue, when protruded, is too mobile; some of the teeth are usually 
found ground at their tips. This is most commonly the case with the canines. 
“Such a child should be watched carefully as to matters of health. He should 
rest much, and neyer be allowed to get exhausted by work, play, or late hours. 
“Certain general conditions of the brain will now be described in terms which 
indicate points for observation. A child is said to be inert when slow in all his 
movements, each movement itself being slow, the formation of compound movements 
(associated movements), and the time of action after stimulation being all behind- 
hand. In such a case look for signs of defective make of the features, signs of ill 
nutrition and exhaustion. In any case a wisely conducted training is especially 
necessary to aid brain development. In such a child you will want to see signs of 
increasing brain power, quicker movement upon stimulation, the action being more 
exactly and quickly controlled by the eye and the ear; greater strength for fatigue; 
greater capacity for the formation of the groups of movements or unions among 
nerve centers. Increasing brain development is also shown by lessened spontaneous 
movement, as the child grows up, concurrent with increase of intelligent movements 
controlled through the senses. The power to sleep and rest should remain unim- 
paired. 
“The indications of mental anxiety and bodily pain may be compared. In looking 
at children it is well to see what is wrong before trying to find out the cause. Look- 
ing at the face you may see an average of fixed expression, principally located in 
the frontal zone, as vertical furrows, not apparently due to present impressions 
through the senses, but apparently to a delayed expression of long antecedent 
impression. Such usually indicates a brain state corresponding to mental anxiety 
or pain as distinguished from suffering due to states of other parts of the body. 
Suffering produced by some part of the body at the time of observation is indicated 
in the lower part of the face by depression of the angles of the mouth. Depressed 
angles of the mouth suggest inquiry as to some cause of pain or something acting 
and about to produce an outburst of crying. In searching for the cause of the

expression of mental anxiety, watch the face as you touch upon various subjects in 
conversation; see what increases or diminishes the appearance. It may be that all 
conversation lessens the appearance of anxiety, which returns the most when the 
child is left unimpressed. Then it is probably due to some fixed thought or fear. 
In the condition of mental pain, corresponding to a memory or a sad thought, the 
expression there is written on the forehead, the eyebrows being drawn together, 
causing vertical creases. I have seen a class of boys all frowning and their eye- 
brows thus knit wheu hard at mathematical work. A placid face with changeful 
expression is an index free to show us varying brain states.”—(Mental Faculty, 
Warner, pp. 74-86.) 
While the foregoing quotations are, for the most part, mérely argumentative, 
though evidently based on careful observation, and carry conviction by cireumstan- 
tial evidence chiefly, a witness may now be introduced who presents an array of facts 
carefully gleaned from teachers and students. The statements are based upon 
individual reports of 116 teachers, hence are the depositions of eyewitnesses. 
Mr. Francis Galton, F. R. 8., president of the Anthropological Institute of Great 
Britain and Ireland, published a few years ago, in the journal of the institute, a 
paper read at one of its annual meetings, in which he says: 
“I determined to test the matter of fatigue, and sent out a number of selected 
questions bearing on the subject. The Teachers’ Guild kindly assisted me by circu- 
lating my questions. The replies received form the basis of the following remarks: 
“The objects of my questions were, first, to determine the signs and effects of 
incipient fatigue in as measurable a form as possible, for it is obviously most desira- 
ble to know what the tests of fatigue should be, in consequence of the contradictory 
opinions entertained frequently. There ought to be no room for doubt as to whether 
the pupils in a particular school or class and at.a particular time were or were not 
overfatigued. Secondly, I wished to hear from the teachers whether they had them- 
selves ever broken down from overwork, and what their own experiences might be 
concerning their pupils and friends. The actual questions are subjoined: Nos. 1, 2, 
and 8 regard the person addressed; Nos. 4, 5, and 6 regard their pupils and 
acquaintances: 
“Question 1.—What particular mental work can you perform easily when your mind 
is fresh that you find difficult or impossible when your mind is somewhat fatigued? 
“Question 2.—Has illness, due solely to mental overwork, independent of domestic 
anxiety and worry, ever incapacitated you for more than a month at a time from 
ordinary school work? If so, give dates and symptoms? Do you consider your 
present health to be in anyway affected by that illness? 
“Question 3.—Has experience discovered to you any warning signs, bodily or men- 
tal, distinct or obscure, of the imminent approach of mental fatigue other than the 
growing sense of becoming fatigued? If so, describe them. a 
“ Question 4.—What particular intellectual work do you find your pupils perform 
with ease when their minds are fresh in which they fail, more or less, when they are 
mentally fatigued, even though they are still interested in their work? 
“Question 5.—Have you known cases of more or less serious prostration from mental 
overwork as distinguished from the effects of domestic or other anxiety? If so, give 
initials and dates and a very brief notice of the severity and duration of the illness. 
“Question 6.—Has experience discovered to you any warning signs of imminent 
mental fatigue among overzealous pupils? 
“The upshot of the replies to the questions is as follows: 
“General aspect.—Experienced teachers place most dependence on the general 
aspect of their classes, due to a variety of small indications, such as jaded expres- 
sion and abnormal skin color. They more especially speak of a strange look in the 
eye, which is variously described as dazed, weary, fixed, or lack luster, as being a 
peculiarly characteristic indication that work should be slackened at once. 
“Nervous irregularities.--Restlessness appears to be the commonest sign of partial 
fatigue; that is, of the attention being wearied, while the muscles are craving to be

employed. I may here for one moment break my plan of not traveling beyond my 
brief by alluding to a short account I wrote in Nature, vol. 22, page 174, but signed 
only with my initials, entitled ‘Measure of fidget,’ describing how I had succeeded 
in counting the varying rate of fidget of a section of a large audience during the 
reading of a wearisome memoir. I have since frequently tried this method, It isan 
amusing way of passing an otherwise dull evening; but, in drawing conclusions 
from the number of movements, the average age of the audience and their habits of 
thought have to be taken into account. Children are extraordinarily mobile, and 
those adults who are little accustomed to concentrate their attention are rarely still, 
cept when spellbound by eloquence. On the other hand, I have frequently noticed 
at meetings of the Royal Society that as many of the persons present as I could hold 
in a glance were all as rigid as statuary for many seconds together. Yawning and 
Jolling aro common among tired children, and twitchings and grimaces, which in 
serions cases culminate in St. Vitus’s dance. Here are some extracts from the various 
replics: 
“(1) Sudden muscular movements. (2) Grimaces, frowning, or compression of the 
lips are marked signs. (3) The fingers sometimes twitch and the whole nervous 
system seems affected. (4) Twitching of the face. (5) Twitching, blinking the 
eyes. (6) Fluttering of the eyelids. (7) Tendency to nervous laughter or moye- 
ments. One correspondent has fits of sneezing in the early morning when he has 
been fatigued over night. 
“General unsteadiness of muscular coordination is shown by bad and shaky hand- 
writing; this is sometimes specifically mentioned, but more often implied by such 
phrases as: (8) Careless writing or (9) failure in all work requiring neatness. 
(10) Sometimes a loss of power to continue writing, the pen going crooked, ete. 
Fatigue is also very frequently indicated by disordered utterances, as (11) tend- 
ency to stumble over words when speaking; (12) refusal of the tongue to obey the 
will, so that in speaking or reading I substitute one word for another. 
“Trregularity of nervous action is further shown by conditions of pallor or of 
flushings in the face. They sometimes alternate, testifying to a depression of 
general nerye power, combined with morbid excitability. Allusions to abnormal 
skin color are frequent in the replies. One teacher goes so far as to lay particular 
stress on the color of the tips of the ears in deciding whether and in what way 
the girls of her class aro suffering. If the tips are white, flaccid, and drooping, 
she concludes the girls are thoroughly weary in mind. If they are relaxed but 
purplish, she concludes that they are tired not with study but from struggling with 
their nerves, which the average schoolgirl of 14 or 15 very rarely has completely 
under control. 
«« Teadaches.—The frequent occurrence of headaches in varied forms and in every 
degree of severity may be accepted as a matter of course, similarly as regards cold 
feet, faintness, and actual faintings. Sleeplessness in a very serious degree is 
another well-known sign; much more rarely somnolence. Grinding the teeth at 
night and talking in the sleep are frequently mentioned; somnambulism occasion- 
ally so. I do not propose to enter into details respecting any of the matters just 
mentioned, as they are all of them well-known signs of over fatigue. It may, how- 
ever, perhaps interest the meeting to see a drawing I hold in my hand made in sleep 
not many weeks ago by a young friend and connection of my own, who was study- 
ing rather too hard for a Government examination. He awoke in the night and 
found himself in his nightgown, sitting at his table, with the gas burning and with 
his grotesque sketch of an elephant’s head and of some other animals just com- 
pleted. The ink was still wet. Heo had not the slightest recollection of anything 
previous to the act of awakening, but there had been conversation before he went to 
bed that probably suggested the sketch. 
“ Disposition.—Irritability is perhaps the commonest sign of incipient fatigue. 
My correspondents freely acknowledge it to be so with themselves, and it is very 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  MENTAL FATIGUE IN SCHOOL. 1183 
easily noticed among their pupils, who become cross and peevish when tired. Ishall 
not enter further into this, as the fact is a familiar one; it is also well known that 
the nerves of sensitive people become so irritable by overwork as to be painfully 
jarred by what they wholly disregard when well, such as the ticking of clocks and 
the rattle of the street. A most pitiable amount of suffering is disclosed in these 
replies, due to nervous irritability. Much is said of the gloomy way of looking at 
life that is brought on by overwork; of the sense of incapacity, of magnifying 
trifles, and of dread of society. Irritability is sometimes accompanied by a notable 
amount of ordinary excitablity expressed by such remarks as: (1) I get nervous and 
start at noises; (1) I start sometimes at a sudden noise or movement in the room. 
“Tt is, I need hardly say, known by experiment, that both the quickness and the 
magnitude of the reaction to any stimulus is greatly affected by fatigue. 
“There is an experiment, not so well known as it should be, that after a class had 
practice in performing it, can be repeated at any time in a few seconds, which gives 
an excellent measure of the varying amount of reaction time. The class take hands 
all around, the teacher being included in the circle; a watch with a second-hand 
lies on the table before him. All the pupils shut their eyes. When the second-hand 
of the watch comes to a division the teacher gives a squeeze with his left hand to 
the right hand of the pupil next tohim. That pupil forthwith with his left hand 
squeezes the right hand of the next pupil, and so on. Thus the squeeze travels 
around the class and is finally received by the right hand of the teacher, who then 
records the elapsed time since he started it; or he may let it make many cireuits 
before he does so. This interval, divided by the number of pupils in the class and 
by the number of circuits, gives the average reaction time of each pupil. The 
squeeze takes usually about a second of time to pass through each dozen or fifteen 
persons. We should expect to find uniformity in successive experiments when the 
pupils are fresh; irregularity and prevalent delay when they are tired. I wish that 
teachers would often try this simple, amusing, and attractive experiment, and when 
they have assured themselves that their class enters into its performance with 
interest and curiosity, they might begin to make careful records at different periods 
of the day, and see whether it admits of being used as a test of incipient fatigue. 
Deceptions must of course be guarded against. 
“ Senses.—The frequency with which serious alteration in the power of hearing 
and of seeing is mentioned, and the feelings sometimes of intense sensitivity and 
sometimes of numbness, show that the delicacy of the senses is markedly affected by 
fatigue. 
‘Hearing is often heightened in keenness; sometimes it is dulled. It is height- 
ened in those numerous cases of irritability of which I have spoken, when the tired 
brain becomes almost maddened by an organ grinder. It is temporarily paralyzed 
in others. The following is a mixed case: (1) My hearing had never been very 
acute, and I think the first symptom of fatigue is a feéling of deafness, but at the 
same time that I can not hear the voices I want to hear, the outside noises of traffic, 
bells, etc., become intolerable. Other cases of deafness from fatigue are (2) ina- 
bility to hear in school without a painful effort and (3) increased deafness. 
‘Vision is greatly affected by over fatigue, not only owing to the strain upon the 
eyes from much reading in a bad light, but apparently through more deeply seated 
causes as well. It it difficult otherwise to account for the following interesting case 
in which color-blindness was brought on by fatigue and disappeared after rest. It 
has much physiological interest and well deserves being placed on record. The lady 
allows me to mention her name for the sake of authenticity. She is Miss J. Beckett, 
Girls’ Grammar School, Ripon. She reports as follows: 
««¢ After several hard hours of continuous study I have been subject to attacks of 
color-blindness, which leave me after resting. The first time I noticed that I was 
not able to distinguish one color from another was when I was reading for the 
London matriculation years ago. I was at the same time etching for an American   
 
-P-A-G-E-226

magazine and teaching most of the day. This lasted from Christmas to July, when 
I began to feel considerably worn out. One day I went to spend a few hours with a 
friend, and while there began to paint some ivy leaves on a terra-cotta plaque. 
Imagine my distress when my friend told me the leaves were orange instead of green. 
On my return I went into my study, and to my astonishment the curtains, which 
were blue in color, looked a kind of dingy yellow. However, in a few hours I was 
quite well. Toward the end of the year I was obliged to give up work on account 
of my health. I got well and took up my work again, still subject to temporary 
color-blindness when tired.’ In answer to further inquiries she adds: ‘I do not 
remember whether I have any difficulty in recalling colors when tired. From a 
little child Ihave been particularly fond of them, and can readily paint flowers, 
foliage, and neutral tints from memory.’ 
“The frequency and severity with which the sight is affected by fatigue is suffi- 
ciently shown by the following extracts: 
“*(1) The eyes fail first. Sometimes after hurrying to a lesson, on my arrival I 
could not see a single note on the page of music for a few minutes. After writing 
and playing long everything goes black, or black spots dance up and down. - (2) A 
time of great excitement or worry will so affect my sight that for about half an hour 
at a time I can see nothing clearly. The outline of everything is deficient in some 
part, so that I only see half of a thing at a time. There seems to be a bright wheel 
of light whizzing in the corner of one or the other eye. (3) At first the lines of the 
page become indistinct, then at intervals they appear to vibrate; finally they merge 
into one mass. (4) The words appear torise from the paper, and frequently a double 
row of words is visible. (5) Lights and after images are distinct before my eye. 
(6) A confusion in the lettering of mathematical diagrams is sometimes an early 
symptom of fatigue among my pupils. 
“As regards sensations in the eye itself, beside such remarks as: (7) A dazzling 
and burning sensation in the eye, the following is a case of an affection of the eye 
being subordinate to that of the brain rather than vice versa. (8) A nervous sensa- 
tion in the eyes as though the eyeballs were loose in my head and would fall which- 
ever way the head is inclined. The sensation is worse on lying down. I am some- 
what nearsighted and wear glasses, but only feel this-disagreeable sensation when 
mentally weary, not necessarily through overreading. 
“ Memory.—A very common and early symptom of fatigue is failure of memory, 
using that word in the allied senses of recalling ideas at will, or else of former ideas 
presenting themselves readily by association, or else of the sure association of mus- 
cular movements engaged in utterance with the idea of the words intended to be 
uttered. I have made extracts of no less than twenty-five cases of failure of mem- 
ory, out of which I will select half a dozen. 
(1) My first indication of mental failure is an inability to spell common words; my 
second, an omission of words in writing; my third, sudden forgetfulness of what I 
am actually saying. (2) Tendency to forget the meaning of words in a foreign lan- 
guage which are usually well known or have been met with quite recently. Tend- 
ency to make stupid blunders in subjects in which, when the mind is in full vigor, 
it is accurate without effort. Simple and obvious mistakes are increased twofold in 
number, and that throughout the class. (3) Through days and weeks together the 
utterance of wrong words or sentences not intended or desired to be spoken, and the 
writing of wrong words. (4) Tendency to stumble over words in speaking, and 
to misplace letters in writing, generally putting them too soon, as ‘Wesday’ for 
‘Wednesday.’ (5) Want of power of calling at will to memory names and little 
matters connected with everyday life. (6) Some of the pupils never spell correctly 
when tired. z 
‘Arithmetic and mathematics.—The studies that are the first to fail under fatigue 
differ in different individuals, but in the majority of cases those of arithmetic and 
elementary mathematics go soonest. Though many of the 116 replies come from  
-P-A-G-E-227
MENTAL FATIGUE IN SCHOOL. 1185 
teachers who have little, if anything, to do with those subjects, no less than 47 spe- 
cially mention them, For example: 
(1) The merely mechanical processes of arithmetic become bewildering at the 
end of a day in which I have been particularly engrossed with school work. (2) 
Arithmetic and algebra become impossible when fatigued, not as being disagreeable 
or painful, but because I then blunder so much that it is hardly any use attempting 
them. (3) Another correspondent speaks of the impossibility when fatigued of 
doing work that requires both accuracy of detail and a certain force of will to fix the 
attention, such as arithmetic. (4) Speaks of the difficulty to tired boys of working 
out any common-sense problem in arithmetic. 
‘Though very many similar answers could be quoted in corroboration of these, 
there are two that tell in an opposite direction. They are: (5) Whenever my mind 
is wearied it affords me a certain amount of relief to do some work which involves 
the solving of arithmetical and algebraical problems, and by preference such as call 
for the use of logarithms or of the slide rule. (6) I find accounts a great rest when 
I can not exert my mind usefully in any other way. 
“TImay be permitted again to break my rule by adding a case from my own 
knowledge of a very distinguished man, now deceased, who, having always found 
repose in his favorite mathematics when he was fagged and worried by multifarious 
duties, naively recommended the same remedy to a friend whose brain had so broken 
down for a time that he shrank from the least mental exertion as from a fatal 
danger, 5 
“ Languages.—A difficulty in translating is another of the noticeable effects of 
incipient fatigue, and is partly due to the lapses of memory already spoken of. (1) 
In translating, words and phrases do not occur readily to the mind. (2) Translation 
into or out of a foreign language with which I am not very familiar. (3) I have 
occasionally lost the power of speaking German when fatigued, though when in my 
ordinary condition I speak it without conscious effort, The failure to translate well 
is due, of course, to much more than the simple failure of memory in small things, 
and depends on the loss of power of grasp, and on depressed mental vigor gener- 
ally. The following is an instructivé case: 
“When I taught young boys of ages 8 to 13 all day, I took arithmetic and Latin in 
the morning, and English reading, geography, etc., in the afternoon. On some occa- 
sions the Latin lesson got put off till the afternoon, and I was surprised to find that 
lesson, which was always a successful one in the morning, failed entirely in the 
afternoon. ‘The boys wished to learn but could not. Their ordinary work, which 
made less demand on the intellect, they did in the afternoon well enough. This and 
such like cases fall more properly in the next division. 
“ Failure of mental grasp.—The evidence that the mind fatigued is unable to work up to 
its normal standard, and that it wastes itself in futile exertion, are very numerous. They 
aresuchas: (1) Failure of ability to grasp the meaning of evensimple things. (2) Fail- 
ure of the portative memory. In reading, complete inability to take in the matter 
whilst mechanically scanning the page. A curious incapacity to count the cups when 
serving tea. (3) Reading sentences without recognition of what wasread. (4) Con- 
fusion alternating with excessive clearness of thought. (5) Tendency of thoughts 
to wander. Failure in pupils to grasp the meaning of what is said to them quickly 
and fully. (6) Before the actual sense of power to grasp ideas, and of an incapacity 
for conveying them clearly. (7) Inability to read the Journal of Education, 
(8) Rapid disappearance of immediately preceding concepts, and hence difficulty in 
establishing connections between paragraphs, as in writing a review article. 
(9) Tendency to use long words. (This strikes me as a very suggestive reply.) 
(10) Any book in which the language 1s wanting in ease and simplicity, though its 
subject may be familiar or easily understood. In short, to use a common and vigor- 
ous phrase, the mind ceases to bite when 1t is fatigued. 
“ Failure of energy.—It requires no evidence to corroborate the well-known fact that 
ED 96. 38  
-P-A-G-E-228
1186 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
energy fails as fatigue increases. New subjects are distasteful; teaching dullards 
becomes almost an impossibility, Sustained effort, vigorous inspection, quick 
decision—all are impossible. 
“ Possibility of tests of incipient fatigue.—The replies I have received do not contain 
any distinct proposition of tests of incipient mental fatigue, and I am myself far 
too ignorant of the practice of education to venture to formulate any. On the other 
hand, the replies are not deficient in indications of what such tests might be directed 
to ascertain. They are principally as follows: 
“(1) The length of time during which neatness of execution can be sustained in 
performing a prolonged task. (2) Promptness and sureness of memory in simple 
things. (3) Common-sense arithmetical problems. (4) Reaction time. The meas- 
ure of fatigue is inversely the measure of endurance, and this strikes me as being a 
faculty that well deserves investigation, Under the strain and exhausting calls of 
modern civilized life, the power of endurance is rising continually in importance. 
Men and women have nowadays to act rapidly and for many hours, and not only to 
act exceptionally well. It therefore seems very reasonable that teachers should 
direct their attention to some fair way of appraising the relative power of endurance 
among their pupils. It is of course incidentally discovered in the ordinary course of 
tuition, but one would like to see appropriate tests directly applied to determine it, 
and such as would show at any time, in a definite and unmistakable manuer, whether 
the minds of pupils were fagged or not. 
“ Breaking down.—I now come to the evidence given in these replies respecting the 
frequency with which both pupils and teachers are found to break down. There is 
an intelligible and very transparent tendency in not a few of the respondents to say 
that such a thing as overwork is impossible in their respective schools. Some of 
them protest so much and so extravagantly as to raise not a little suspicion. There 
are eyen a few who say they have never heard of a case of breaking down. 
“Taking all the replies together, I find that, out of my 116 correspondents, no less 
than 23 of them have at some period of their lives broken down, and that 21 of these 
have never wholly recovered the effects. There are 6 other cases of a less serious 
kind, some of them slight. In other words, 1 out of 5 teachers has, so far as the 
evidence before me goes, been severely stricken. As to the cases well known to 
my correspondents, there is a vagueness in some of the replies where the word 
‘several’ and the like are used, to which I am quite unable to assign a numerical 
yalue, but 59 sad cases are specified in detail in answer to question 5: ‘Haye you 
known cases of more or less serious prostration from mental overwork, as distin- 
guished from the effects of domestic or other anxiety? If so, give initials and dates 
and a very brief notice of the severity and duration of the illness.’ 
“Tn many other cases the writers express the difficulty they feel in distinguishing 
between worry and overwork. The latter is a consequence of the former, while the 
former often results from the gloom, anxiety, and sense of incapacity caused by the 
latter. It is a self-regenerating circle of evil. 
“T draw two conclusions from the replies. The first is, that the reason why men- 
tal fatigue leaves effects that are so much more serious than those of bodily fatigue 
is largely owing to tho cause just mentioned. When a man is fatigued in body he 
has yery similar symptoms to many of those mentioned above, but there is a great 
after difference. As soon as tho bodily exertion has closed for the day, the man lies 
down and his muscles have rest; but when the mentally fatigued man lies down, 
his enemy continues to harass him during his weary hours of sleeplessness. He can 
not quiet his thoughts, and he wastes himself in a futile way. 
“The other conclusion is that cases of breakdown usually occur among those who 
work by themselves, and not among pupils whose teachers keep a reasonable over- 
sight. Overzealous pupils are rare, as many of my correspondents insist. But the 
danger is not so much at school, when the hours of study and those of play and 
exercise aro fixed, as it is at the age when young persons are qualifying themselves 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  MENTAL FATIGUE IN SCHOOL. 1187 
for the profession of a teacher, and who have also to support themselves, and per- 
haps to endure domestic trials at the same time. Dull persons protect their own 
health of brain by refusing to overwork. It is among those who are zealous and 
eager, who have high aims and ideas, who know themselves to be mentally gifted, 
and are too generous to think much of their own health that the most frequent 
victims of overwork are chiefly found.” 
The Pedagogium, an educational monthly of high reputation and great influ- 
ence, published in Leipsic and edited by Dr. Friedr. Dittes, recently deceased, con- 
tained in the January number (1896) an article on ‘‘ Mental overpressure in echoate? 
which may be regarded as an authoritative expression from an educational stand- 
point. The article is here reproduced in English as a valuable addition to the 
discussion. The author is Dr. Alfred Spitzner, of Leipsic. He says: 
“The question resolves itself into an inquiry into the causés of nervousness among 
children from overtaxation in school. In examining the following points, most 
important in my estimation, I beg leave to define my attitude from a pedagogical 
standpoint. We may ask, To what extent does the evil exist and in what direction 
is it to be looked for? These points are by no means so well defined as many people, 
the members of the medical profession in particular, incline to suppose. From the 
present understanding of the question the practical teacher has good cause to pro- 
ceed in its examination with the greatest precaution. Let us consider the first 
point. 
““(1) To what extent are schools responsible for the nervous conditions existing 
among the pupils of both sexes? 
“Excepting a few cautious and conservative physicians, we find the medical pro- — 
fession generally convinced that nervousness, as a disease, is on an appalling increase 
even among children, and that this is chiefly due to their being overtaxed in ele- 
mentary as well as secondary schools, ‘The demands of city schools, particularly, 
are greatly endangering the health of the coming generation’—‘ Every third child 
attending a city school has, as a rule, poor blood’—‘ Thirty per cent of the school 
children of Europe suffer from nervous affections’—‘Chorea, hysteria, and psychosis 
among children are consequences of school work.’ Such and similar remarks are 
frequently heard; the foregoing are culled from resolutions passed by medical 
conventions. 
“The educator who is conversant with the actual conditions of a child’s life in 
primary, grammar, as well as high schools, must, in view of his own experience and 
psychological knowledge, earnestly protest against these statements of medical men 
which, in case they be retailed among the people, will result in a pernicious reaction 
against the cause of civilization, i. e., public education. 
“The basis of this protest is the consideration that the statistical material upon 
which medical opinion is based can not be accepted as sufficiently demonstrative; 
all of it is collected from the statistics of the consultation rooms and private inquiry. 
As far as I know, there is no such thing as a comprehensive, officially organized 
investigation and compilation of facts referring to the existence and cause of nery- 
ousness among school children. In consequence, despite the careful investigations 
of Hertel and Key and several others on a smaller scale made in England and 
America, the categorical expressions of nerve specialists concerning dangers to the 
health of school children are by no means sufficiently well established to be gen 
erally accepted, or to lay the foundation for reformatory measures. 
“The protest is furthermore based on the fact that often it is absolutely impossi- 
ble for nerve specialists to determine with any degree of certainty whether in any 
one case of nervousness the school be responsible or not. Error is the more likely 
to prevail the more physicians accustom themselves to consider headache, a dull 
feeling in the head, palpitation of the heart, indigestion, anemia, and the various 
injuries of children’s intellectual powers simply symptoms of nervousness, overesti- 
mating them in their diagnoses, and the more they rely on their memory in retailing

the statements of children and their parents. Mindful of the dignity of the school, 
the educator must demand of nerve specialists that they treat the question How 
and where does nervousness in school children originate? and not merely ask 
What percentage of school children have nervous affections? The attention and 
experience of the medical profession alone do not suffice for an exact and true eti- 
ology of nervousness in children; they must be combined with psychologic-pedagogic 
observation and experience. Unfortunately this is almost éntirely overlooked, to the 
detriment of the school, In consequence schools are held responsible for many 
eyils originating elsewhere. When the new science of ‘child study’ has so far 
advanced that the experience of both the teacher and the physician finds adequate 
consideration, there will be milder judgment on the part of the physician in regard 
to how far the school is at fault. 
“We must enter into detail on this point. To form a fixed opinion on the causes 
of the phenomena specified the teacher must, in the first place, point out the fre- 
quent existence of somatic defects which the child in question has either inherited 
or acquired from some general source altogether independent of school. And in the 
second place he must point out the fact that many forms of nervousness are chiefly 
caused by the evils of public life and of domestic relations, by which children are 
influenced. 
“What I have said is nothing new. I only wish to emphasize that in explaining 
nervousness in children and its causes the facts referred to must be considered more 
in their real meaning and should be considered in the light of a teacher's experience. 
“Professor Kollmann and others maintain that nervous diseases are hardly known 
in the lower social strata, but are caused by the increase of duties in the higher 
strata. Every elementary school teacher knows from personal experience that not 
a few children enter school physically weak and very nervous. In my class of 24 
boys between 12 and 13 years of age only 10 are physically strong; 14 are feeble, 
infirm, and ailing. One boy is epileptic; 2 are afflicted with St, Vitus’s dance; 1 has 
serious heart trouble; 5 suffer from disturbed or weak power of sensation; 4 from 
diseased or weak vegetative functions; 1 boy has a stiff leg; 8 are indisputably ner- 
yous. Surely neither the school nor myself would be held responsible for such 
distressing cases. The epileptic is the son of an innkeeper and spends much of his 
time in the barroom. One of the boys afflicted with St. Vitus’s dance is the son of a 
builder, and being much in company with his father’s workman became a whisky 
drinker early in life. Most of the others with nervous affections have passed through 
severe contagious diseases. In forming a true judgment of diseases among school 
children the fact that many children are not in good health when entering school 
should not be underrated. 
“Educators must lay special stress upon the fact that in many instances the ner- 
vousness found among children is to be charged to the families from which they 
come. ‘Overpressure’ is a very convenient term for the use of parents and superiors 
of children to cover the evils chargeable to their account. Teachers must therefore, 
as far as is within their power, expose the falsity of such excuses and give vent to 
their feeling of regret that many physicians countenance this action on the part of 
the parents by disparaging schools above all other things in their medical advice. 
It is a teacher’s common experience, before and after summer yacation, to receive 
petitions addressed, in pursuance of medical advice, to school authorities stating 
that this or that child of (wealthy) parents needs an earlier or more extended trip in 
the country for the sake of rest from mental application. I am far from wishing to 
deprive children of this rest. I maintain, however, that unless there has been a 
serious illness the need for rest in such cases is commonly attributed to school. Now, 
do physicians in charge know these children well? Do they know exactly what work 
is required of them in school and how much they are able to do? Generally not. The 
teachers of these often pitiable creatures can point to other causes than overtaxation 
in schvol. They know the imperfections, perversions, inconsistencies, and senseless
-P-A-G-E-231
  MENTAL FATIGUE IN SCHOOL. 1189 
principles of home training and the sad consequences of excessive severity and over- 
excitement through ambition that torment childrenin many families. Teachers learn 
to know the sad state of children in homes where a fondness for pleasure and distrac- 
tions is prematurely cultivated, the time for recreation is shortened by useless music 
lessons and coaching, and where imaginative reading and immoderate athletic 
exercises or pleasures (children’s dancing parties, cycling, foot and base ball) are 
indulged in. 
“The consequences of nervousness upon such evil conditions are easily observed 
and proven. Physicians should rouse the consciences of parents before blaming the 
schools. Family physicians influence to.a certain extent the first education of chil- 
dren, and can therefore in a measure see to it that a want of judgment, energy, and 
sense of duty in parents do not, in children of three or four years of age, engender 
intellectual faults which afterwards, in consequence of increased duties of school life, 
develop into intellectual anomalies or disorders of the psychic activities. Observa- 
tions of the intellectual development of infants, such as we owe to Kussmaul, Preyer, 
Striimpell, Vierordt, and Wundt, prove the great importance of early education of 
children. 
“ According to pedagogical experience the children of plain people—the middle 
strata of society—are the healthiest. In Leipsic, for instance, as I may believe from 
private inquiry, complaints about sickly and incapable children are not so frequent 
in burgher schools as in the higher, the pupils of which belong to more pretentious 
families. Although it must not be forgotten that the most capable boys in tliese 
schools usually leave from the fifth grade (eighth school year) to enter a high school, 
for which reason the percentage of less gifted and physically incompetent pupils 
increases considerably in the higher classes, the complaints mentioned are not justly 
to be explained by this fact alone, nor by the mental overpressure of these children. 
‘‘Furthermore, even if many of the children of poor parents suffer from nervous 
affections, no physician can lay the blame on the schools as the first cause, when 
experience points directly to bad food, cramped, badly constructed and located 
dwellings, and unhealthy sleeping apartments. Moreover, with these children the 
strain of outside work plays an important part. Thus I learned from two pale, 
jaded-looking girls in one of my former classes, that they had to sew regularly until 
12 o’clock at night, and during the busy season till 4 in the morning. In districts 
where the custom of house industry prevails—-that is, where, instead of factories and 
large workshops, industrial production takes place in the family dwellings—such 
facts exist in distressingly large numbers. Such evils offer a much broader field of 
action to physicians who are humanely interested in the public health than the sins 
of the schoolroom. But then, the school is so much nearer at hand and so much 
more conyenient for attack, to be sure. 
“Tn examining the causes of nervousness in children the observations and expe- 
riences of teachers lead to exonerating the schools, and plainly show the harmful 
influence of prevalent customs. Especially is this applicable to hygiene in second- 
ary schools. Thesestudents are in the age which an observant physician has called 
the storm and stress period. He who penetrates into the secrets of our city youth 
can not possibly be surprised at the increasing physical and mental derangement of 
the children of certain social strata. With them overexertion in school can hardly 
be taken into account, as such young men usually avoid every higher intellectual 
effort. 
“From the little that has been said it follows, that if psychologic-pedagogic expe- 
riences are properly applied for the purpose of a true analysis of the material 
derived from examinations of children the percentage of illness for which the school 
is held responsible will sensibly decrease. Most of the fault-finding of the medical 
profession will share the same fate, i. e., it will be discredited. Take, for instance, 
the opinion of Dr. Hasse, which for some years was current throughout Germany, 
that the overtaxation of school children lays the foundation for later psychic derange-
-P-A-G-E-232
1190 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
ments; in other words, that schools increase the number of the insane; reports of all 
insane asylums under the jurisdiction of the Prussian Government state, upon inquiry 
of the minister of education, that the views of Dr. Hasse can not be substantiated. 
The cases in which mental derangement can be properly attributed to mental over- 
pressure in school are very rare. 
“Psychologic pedagogy has reason enough to regret that the medical profession is 
so ready to attribute the responsibility of nervousuess, especially in its origin, to 
theschools. Such an opinion can and must never become general, and should always 
be expressed with the greatest reserve. The term “overtaxation” has already 
become an excuse among children, a convenient apology for unscrupulous parents 
who often have no conception of what overtaxation of the brain and nervousness 
are, and a weapon in the hands of the enemies of schools by means of which they 
shield their secret intentions. It is a most significant fact that this term, supported 
by medical authority, acquires an unconditional popular value. Pedagogy must 
point ont the danger lying in the indiscriminate use of the term, for it is a danger 
that threatens all educational progress, clouds the educational wants of the present 
and coming generations, and checks the promotion of science, art, industry, and 
trade. If any governments are occupied with the practical consequences of this 
question, the argument should be emphasized that the strict and earnest fulfillment 
of duty and intellectual work such as the school requires, both in ethical and scien- 
tific regard, is just what is needed to counteract the stimuli of irrational home and 
exciting public life; itis of too great a value for the hygiene of the mind to be 
suppressed by obscure and unfounded opinions of some physicians. 
“Tn contradistinction to what has been said, it is now asserted that schools are 
partially responsible for nervousness among children, because they are favorable to 
its development. 
“This is true in certain cases. In the first place some children of inadequate 
talent can do justice to their work in school only by excessive diligence; and in the 
second place, many children are so hindered in their studies by pronounced physical 
derangements, such as epilepsy, heart trouble, neuralgia, ete., or even by mere incli- 
nation thereto, that they are daily exposed to the danger of overworking themselves. 
In both cases nervous diseases may be caused or developed. Such conditions, 
deplorable as they are, can no more be ascribed to schools than the overtaxation of 
a child which, from a want of the sense of duty and respect for school, and a desire 
for play, etc., idles away or poorly distributes its time, allows work to accumulate, 
and then, at night, with a hot head and cold hands endeavors to perform its school 
lessons when it should be in bed. 
“The consideration of public schools for the physical constitution of pupils has 
its limits} first, on account of the objective educational end which school, conform- 
ably to its character, must keep in view; and secondly, because pupils whose physi- 
cal and mental constitution is normal can not be neglected and wronged for the sake 
of the weak and infirm. It is impossible for school to consult every psychical pecul- 
iarity in children and to prevent discipline, increasing tasks, and higher duties from 
doing harm to those of inadequate ability, energy, and endurance. School can not 
neglect the general good for the welfare of a few individuals. This is particularly 
true of secondary schools, but can also, within certain limits, be said of common 
schools. 
“Now, if schools can not depart from their true and normal course, and in conse- 
quence employ harmful severity where certain ineffaceable differences of mental 
endowment or physical capacity exist in the pupils, it follows that the responsibility 
rests wholly with those parents who exact a higher education for their children than 
their talents warrant. Neither are the principles of the lower schools affected by 
the facts in question. It is to be hoped that a medico-pedagogical examination 
will give increased attention to pathological conditions of children, prevalent to a 
greater extent in elementary than in secondary institutions; views of great value
-P-A-G-E-233
  MENTAL FATIGUE IN SCHOOL. TL9F 
for methods of teaching and training would in consequence develop, and their 
consideration lead to the gradual suppression of many an evil now existing in our 
common school system. 
“The first necessity will be to give more scrupulous attention to weak and sickly 
children on their admission into school. Greater efforts must be made for the found- 
ing of schools for the feeble minded or mentally deficient, though what has been 
done in this direction in some cities deserves praise. With the best arrangements 
possible for weak and intellectually dull children, the most depends upon the judg- 
ment, tact, and personal responsibility of the individual teacher. If he commit an 
injustice against such children it is his personal fault, and the school must not be 
blamed. I know of no school law, regulation, or pedagogical precept which, instead 
of awakening strength of character and a sense of duty, causes children to be over- 
burdened with home tasks, exacts more from them than they can do, arouses fear and 
morbid ambition, or spurs weak children on by questionable or degrading punish- 
ments and methods of training. On the other hand we must be careful in judging 
the individual teacher rashly. For it is a most difficult task to recognize oppor- 
tunely and prevent skillfully those mental states in deficient and less-talented chil- 
dren which react harmfully on the nervous system, It must not be forgotten that 
anxiety; bursts of anger against himself, companions, or even the teacher; envy of 
more gifted comrades amounting to hatred; in short, that many exciting states of 
mind affecting the nervous system of a child of unsound mind (taking this term in 
the pedagogical sense) can be observed during school sessions, and must be rightly 
judged by the teacher if he wishes to avoid injurious rigor in his treatment of these 
children. From a hygienic standpoint, therefore, the greatest possible psychological 
training is as much to be desired for teachers as the thorough anatomic-physiological 
education which physicians of the present day advocate so energetically. 
“From what has been said, it follows that pedagogy disproves the medical opinion 
that nervousness of school children is oftenest caused by mental overtaxation. On 
the other hand, it is impelled to demand that the medical profession give more atten- 
tion to the observations and experiences of psychologic pedagogy in regard to the 
origin of nervousness in children. It it not necessary at this point to consider a 
preexisting physically unsound constitution. But it is by no means understood 
that the modern school need not improve its methods respecting the existence and 
increase of nervous diseases. Pedagogy, together with medicine, from causes stated 
and others to be mentioned, recognizes the pressing necessity for the educational prae- 
tice to take into consideration the actual conditions and relations among schoo] 
children in regard to their physical and mental normality and capacity for education 
within the prescribed limits, The pedagogical opinion is that these relations and 
conditions should above all things else be made the immediate and chief subject of 
exact medico pedagogical examination, investigation, and statistics, so that a pro- 
gressive school hygiene may have the benefit of fixed views and established facts, 
which thus acquired will be possessed of that intrinsic truth from which deviate the 
general and ever-spreading wild assertions and unfounded accusations of physi- 
cians in disparagement of schools. 
““We must now examine the second point. 
«(2) In what direction does the evil of mental overtaxation, to the extent of caus- 
ing nervousness in children, exist in the school practice in vogue founded on the 
principles of pedagogy and considered normal and correct? 
“The proposition generally advanced, that present methods of public education 
imperil the health of children, is not only applied to certain evils for which individ- 
ual teachers or schools are called to account, but directly attacks the normal founda- 
tions of school. The censure of physicians does not refer to the harming of already 
sick or nervously inclined pupils, but to injury done to mentally and physically 
normal children by methods and practices considered normal. Dr. Pellmana thus 
tersely expresses himself: ‘Children work too soon, toomuch, and badly; thatis tosay,  
-P-A-G-E-234
1192 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
under unfavorable hygienic conditions.’ In interpreting his meaning we are reminded 
of the long list of studies, the rushing through of courses, the long duration of 
hourly, daily, and weekly lessons of useless studies, the method of teaching, unsci- 
entific in its disregard of the laws of physiology and purely in favor of psychology, 
the eyil of home tasks which rob children of their short periods of recreation, etc. 
We receive also the practical suggestions of omitting home lessons, instructing 
by means of observation lessons, instituting a beneficial interchange of physical and 
mental occupation, etc. 
“Tt may be truthfully said the judgment of the medical profession on these mat- 
ters is not based on an actual, exact, and technical examination of the methods 
employed—a procedure hardly practical—but on inference from facts connected with 
nervous diseases of children which from a medical standpoint are not to be explained 
by any other cause than mental overtaxation. 
“Psychological pedagogy must protest against such arguments. The following 
important points may be touched upon: 
“First of all, pedagogy must maintain that the members of the medical profession 
are to a certain degree uncertain in the definition and diagnosis of the term ‘nervous- 
ness’ as regards its psychological meaning. The reason of this is, that in con- 
sequence of neglecting nonmaterialistic psychology, we are still in the dark concern- 
ing the establishment of the complex of psychical symptoms of presupposed nervous 
states and their diagnoses. This want is explained by the materialistic tendency of 
psychiatry in advancing the proposition: Mental defects and diseases are defects and 
diseases of the brain. Pedagogy can never consent to this proposition from the 
standpoint of that psychology which is based upon the acceptation of an immaterial, 
indivisible soul which is in sympathetic contact and reciprocal action with the brain, 
and as the support of the whole spiritual life capable of development. Mental 
diseases and defects are not diseases and defects of the brain considered as an organ, 
no more than mental soundness is identical with the health of the organ, the brain. 
We can only say that mental defects may arise from a conjoined influence of somatic 
disturbances and diseases upon the psychic occurrences in the soul; as vice versa a 
disease of the brain and nerves may originate in a psychic process. Therefore, we 
must demand a more exact proof of the connection between psychic and somatic 
irregularities and injuries than psychiatry at present adduces. We must maintain 
that the materialistic proposition referred to in case of its application to the intel- 
lectual life of the child, so far as it is influenced by teaching and training, will, 
unless it be used in connection with other and better thoughts, lead to nothing more 
than a surfeiting of pedagogy with ideas altogether too vague and obscure, 
“From this conception there primarily results a physiology which in the under- 
standing and explanation of certain processes, disturbances and unsoundness in the 
physical organism, fails to consider the cooperating psychic factors which are at times 
the true cause. This gives rise occasionally to opinions on the connection between 
psychic defects and physical conditions in children and their causes, which are not 
merely questionable from a medical standpoint, but prove to be actually false. Such 
opinions can create, and to my certain knowledge have occasioned serious-embarrass- 
ment in educational practice. To propose a fitting example, I take the liberty of 
expressing the opinion that physicians have never with any degree of certainty 
defined the difference between actual organic disease and hysteria. I know cases 
in which psychically controlled (hysterical) diseased conditions of individual pupils 
have been charged to the account of schools as severe physical injuries. In one case 
where the laming of a boy’s legs and paralysis of the organs of deglutation was 
attributed to the influence of school, a judicial error was imminent if at the last 
moment the evidencé of a prominent physician had not saved the court from com- 
mitting the mistake. 
“There are certainly the most cogent reasons for treating the. question in hand 
fairly and conscientiously. ‘No comprehension of the changes to which the condition   
-P-A-G-E-235
  MENTAL FATIGUE IN SCHOOL. 1193 
of our bodies is subject,’ writes a medical authority, Prof. Adolph Striimpell, in 
Erlangen, ‘can be more partial and incorrect than that which attributes every 
change to an external material cause. The simplest self-observation must acquaint 
us with the great influence of consciousness over our physical nature. We can turn 
aside from the question of the kind and nature of these states of consciousness, for 
we really know nothing of them. However, so much is evident from superficial 
reflection that in this case qualities are exposed to the view which we find nowhere 
else in the realm of the inorganic world; and laws are in force whose deduction from 
the laws of mechanical processes has so far appeared impossible. The facts of con- 
sciousness, however, are clearly open to observation; they are the surest, in reality 
the only certain knowledge we have on which every conception of the nature of 
things must be based. Even a cursory observation of the states of consciousness 
shows us how the change of conditions in consciousness endlessly reverberate in our 
physical nature. Psychology and philosophy, studies which were formerly taken 
for granted in the preparation for every scientific profession, are now omitted from 
the curriculum of medical colleges. It is no wonder then that even excellent phy- 
sicians are deplorably ignorant of psychological questions and slow in compreliend- 
ing psychological thought.’ 
“Tf,in view of what has been said, the doctrinary foundation upon which the 
medical profession bases its opinion of psychic and in part physiological conditions 
and processes, can not be accepted by teachers who must protect their profession 
against medicine and its encroachments; that is to say, must place psychologic 
pathology and pedagogical hygiene and therapeutics in so clear a light, that the 
facts connected with the intellect and development of children be studied in a man- 
ner consistent with their real meaning and pedagogical observation. This is espe- 
cially necessary, because many psychic peculiarities which, under actual conditions 
and circumstances during childhood, are seemingly natural, but are in reality faults 
from an educational standpoint and hence to be treated pedagogically, are falsely 
defined by the medical profession, prejudiced by physiological or materialistic views, 
as diseased conditions, either caused by existing educational methods, or requiring 
special institutions conducted by medical men. If, as Pellmann, Friedmann, and 
especially Koch maintain, psychic irregularities influencing the personality of man, 
instability and weakness of character and impaired psychic action are to be under- 
stood as symptoms of existing brain and nervous diseases, even though (as Koch 
specifically states) we can not prove presumed illness either anatomically or chem- 
ically, the dissemination of such views owing to the frequent errors of medicine 
regarding psychic facts, threatens education with the immediate danger of an 
unqualified and paramount influence of psychiatry. This is the more to be feared 
the more the medical profession overlooks the essential differences between the faults 
of adults and those of persons physically and intellectually immature. 
“Before a physician refers weakness and instability of character in an adult to 
diseased nerves, he must first examine whether the patient ever has possessed sta- 
bility and firmness of character; consequently whether these qualities are the result 
of a decline of psychic action. We very often seem to forget that what has no 
existence can not be destroyed. The educator must therefore defend his empiric 
knowledge of psychic peculiarities in the nature and development of children against 
the alleged doctrines of psychiatry. There exists a radical ineffaceable difference 
between medico-pathological and pedagogic-pathological processes, conditions, and 
events in a child’s life. It can not be denied that psychic and partly physiological 
faults and irregularities may, in certain cases, be indications of diseased nerves 
requiring medical treatment; but in most instances the specified states are perfectly 
normal phases of a child’s development, and require the attention of the teacher who 
can correct the faults and elevate and perfect the physical and intellectual abilities 
of the child by educational means. We must insist, however, that pedagogy alone 
has the right to establish and judge the facts relevant to the peculiarities in the 
ED 96. 38* 
     
-P-A-G-E-236
1194 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
nature and development of children. These facts are the foundation given by 
experience in the scientific and Stauton development of pedagogy. Pedagogy needs 
neither a medical nor any other guardianship. 
“Tn view of the foregoing remarks, pedagogy can and must refute the reproach, 
expressed by the medical profession, that schools in their normal and strictly peda- 
gogical methods are the cause of nervousness in physically and intellectually normal 
children, Pedagogy must also demand a salutary school hygiene different from that 
defined by physicians, who are biased in favor of materialistic views. A few remarks 
on this point may be desirable. 
“Notwithstanding that in poor andill-regulated communities the health of children 
has been imperiled by inadequate school buildings, uneducated and careless author- 
ities, all kinds of impediments in the way of healthy progress, an insufficient force 
of teachers, and crude and faulty methods of teaching and discipline—evils against 
which the teaching profession has for a long time been exerting its influence and 
energy—it must be admitted that during this century the development of the prac- 
tice of teaching has gradually led toward exacting lighter, instead of increased, 
inteflectual work. No profession with the public good at heart receives, especially 
from persons of influence and authority, so few advances, so little actual acknowl- 
edgment and support as that of teachers. The teacher, as a rule, is zealous for the 
welfare of children and the people. Since the epoch, inaugurated by the works of 
Rousseau and Pestalozzi, teachers and especially those of the German people’s 
schools, have been unremitting in their efforts to instigate or carry out beneficial 
reforms and improvements as required by modern pedagogy. A selection and arrange- 
ment of subjects and studies in the natural order, in contradistinetion to the 
redundancy modern civilization demands; the establishment of a natural order for 
the ends to be obtained, in contradistinction to the intensity of power conditioned by 
progress in all departments of human exertion; psychologically and physiologically 
founded improvements in methods and means of instruction, in place of antiquated 
contrivances; proportionate occupation for the prevention of overloading with 
tasks and duties; the perfection of school as an educational institution, in contra- 
distinction to the school of learning—these are the objects in view to which teachers 
are devoting all their energies. 
“Efforts are made to bring about a beneficial alternation of oceupation in school 
work. The teacher versed in pedagogy conscientiously tries to bring sense-percep- 
tion, and reasoning, desk work, singing, and gymnastics, rest and exercise, work and 
recreation into proper ‘relationship. Intellectual ability, exercise of the organs 
of sense and the action of the whole body are taken into consideration. What 
physician, who feels called upon to serve the cause of education, is thoroughly 
acquainted with the inner work of the modern school. The conscience of a well- 
trained teacher needs no stirring up by the medical profession; and what is more, in 
the field of school hygiene he stands side by side with the physician as his equal. 
The greatest benefit that medicine can confer on the schoois is to put pedagogy in 
the way of controlling the whole State school system, primary as well as secondary; 
for the latter is ill-arranged, viewed from a pedagogical standpoint. 
“For a full appreciation of pedagogical progress it is likewise necessary to form 
an opinion based on experience and scientific facts on the question ‘In what direc- 
_ tion is the practice of teaching to be developed and improved from a hygienic point 
of view?” 
“ The investigations in the department of experimental school hygiene of recent 
date are deserving of mention. Whether, as Burgerstein observes, in their first 
beginning they promise so much that we may expect important results in the future, 
is a point that may be set aside for the present. Let us confine ourselves to facts, 
Up to the present these investigations deal almost exclusively with the recurrent 
expression of a phenomenon known to every teacher: Intense application to mental 
labor, after a certain time, fatigues the pupil’s mind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-237

MENTAL FATIGUF IN SCHOOL. TE 
“The provocation to experimental investigation of mental fatigue in schook 
children is due to Sikorsky and Burgerstein, especially the latter. Since then arti- 
cles and volumes on the subject have been published by Kraepelin, Laser, Hoepfner, 
and Zimmermann. Sikorsky bases his conclusions on 1,500 dictation tests. Burger- 
stein occupied four classes of children, 11 and 12 years old, each ten minutes, with 
the solution of a large number of simple examples in addition and multiplication. 
After a pause of five minutes a new set of examples was begun. The hour was thus 
divided into four periods, in order to study the signs of fatigue as a function of the 
working time. Kraepelin examined the increase and decrease of mental energy, 
and paid especial attention to the factor ‘practice,’ and skill gained by repetition, 
which Burgerstein neglected to consider. Laser did not follow the example of 
Burgerstein in testing the fatigue at the close of an hour, but investigated whether 
children flagged during five hours of a forenoon session. He tried classes of boys 
and girls of the fourth and fifth school year, at the beginning of each of the five 
hours, with arithmetical tasks similar to those given by Burgerstein, and to which 
he likewise devoted only ten minutes cach time. Hoepfner assigned a two hours’ 
dictation to 46 9-year old boys, and then studied the ‘fault line.’ For two years 
Zimmermann has instructed his pupils of the third school year in half-hour lessons, 
or even shorter periods, so that he easily gives five or six different lessons in three 
forenoon hours. He has made the noteworthy observation that more is gained by 
six half-hour lessons in arithmetic than in four whole-hour lessons per week; that 
pupils advance farther in six half-hour than in four whole-hour periods in reading, 
and that six half-hour lessons correspond exactly to four whole-hour lessons in reli- 
gion. 
“The other deductions from examinations are as follows: 
“Sikorsky finds ‘the essential difference between morning work and that per- 
formed after four or five hours’ instruction to average exactly 33} per cent.’ 
‘‘Burgerstein affirms that children make the most mistakes and work ont the 
smallest number of examples during the third period, or third quarter of an hour, 
In the fourth quarter of the hour the enervation preceding is followed by a revival 
of energy. This energy, however, does not come up to that displayed at the begin- 
ning of the hour. 
“Kraepelin draws the conclusion from his investigations ‘that, according to all 
examinations and tests so far made, the fact is undeniable that schools exact more 
from pupils than their intellectual ability admits.’ 
“ Laser deduces the following: (1) Mental vigor is lowest during the first hour. 
(2) It increases during the second and third hours, and declines after that. (3) 
Errors increase in number until the fourth hour and decrease in the fifth. (4) Tho 
number of corrections made by the pupil increases until the fifth hour. (5) The 
boys counted fewer figures than the girls. (6) The boys made more corrections 
than the girls. (7) The number of errors is about the same with boys and girls. 
(8) The number of those who made no mistakes in caleulating decreases from the 
first to the fifth hour. : 
“Hoepfner learned that errors averaged 2.7 to every 100 letters. ‘In the first five 
sentences, namely, in the work done within the first half hour, the percentage, ayer- 
aging on the whole less than 1, showed a tendency to decline; in the sixth sen- 
tence it jumped to over 2, and continued to rise with few vacillations.’ 
“Only Burgerstein, Kraepelin, and Zimmermann, draw practical conclusions from 
their observations. Burgerstein advocates periods not longer than three-quarters 
of an hour. Kraepelin opposes all the claims of school in toto. Zimmermann 
adyances the proposition of giving half-hour lessons only, and says: ‘If we arrange 
to give in ten morning hours (or two per day) thirty to thirty-two brief lessons, the 
afternoons will be free for gymnastics, singing, recreation, nature lessons out of 
doors, female handiwork, and boys’ manual training.’ Zimmermann published ‘A 
reformed course of study for pupils of the third school year,’ which found the

approval of Professor Preyer. Preyer advocates that, from the beginning of the 
school course to its end, children should never be held down to continued mental 
effort for longer than ten, fifteen, twenty, or at the highest, twenty-five minutes. 
“Observations and investigations of the psychic action and ability of exercise in 
children, the effect of habit and practice, conditions, duration and return of fatigue, 
and the alternation of exercise and relaxation, etc., are certainly of great hygienic 
importance. The question of ‘how long a healthy brain of a child can hold out,’ 
is worth investigating. It only remains to be seen whether the experiments and 
experiences made are adapted or sufficient to set criteria for educational methods. 
Ido not incline to concede the significance generally attributed to the experiments 
of Burgerstein, and those similar to his. In the first place, it is self-evident that 
uniform, uninteresting, mechanical, and lengthy work tires children; and in the 
second place, no normal lesson presents such conditions. The conclusion on the 
present mode of teaching is therefore altogether wrong. The only deduction to be 
made is that continuous and monotonous tasks, such as Burgerstein’s methods in 
arithmetic and Hoepfner’s two hours’ dictation, are to be avoided. The facts so far 
observed do not permit a conclusive opinion on the length of period or the daily 
and weekly school or study hours of children. In my estimation, the chief value of 
these experiments, and what sbould be the chief end in view, is the possibility of 
determining, observing, and judging actual appearances of fatigue. 
“A thorough knowledge of the physiological and psychological cenditions and 
processes in their effects and first appearances, on which the phenomena of fatigue 
are founded, is of great importance for school, so far as it may influence the 
management, occupation, and treatment of the individual child. This individual 
momentum, so to speak, is much more important than the conclusions on general 
school management and methods. Burgerstein keeps this almost wholly in the 
background. Kraepelin, Laser, and, especially, Hoepfner do more in this direction. 
The observations of Hoepfner are of greater importance for the psychology of teach- 
ing than for the question regarding the length of periods. As a matter of course, 
it is to be understood that much must be allowed for what is not fatigue; for 
instance, effects of inattention, carelessness, over-zealousness, all kinds of psychic 
and physiologic accidents, etc. 
“Independent of the desirable general observation and investigation of phenom- 
ena, it is necessary to examine the course and differences of mental ability in chil- 
dren individually and generally. To this end more extensive examinations should 
be made of the experiments started by Burgerstein. According to my experience 
the results obtained have no general significance. 
“Tn my class of 24 pupils, averaging 12} years of age, I have made three kinds 
of experiments for testing the given conclusions: (1) Those of Burgerstein; (2) 
those of Laser with the difference of giving the ten-minute examination at the close 
of each lesson, and (3) an experiment with whole and half hour uniform instruction. 
The tasks given out were those of Burgerstein. More repetitions (eight in number) 
were undertaken in order to make allowance for the ‘factor of practice.’ I made the 
following observations: 
“(1) Four repetitions of the experiment allowing for the ‘factor of practice’ did 
not prove that the ‘line of vigor’ drops in the third quarter of the hour; this was true 
in only one individual. In the other cases, energy declined in the second quarter of 
the hour, rose again in the third, and remained almost stationary in the fourth. 
(2) Ability, or skill in performing, attained its highest point in the third and 
fifth hour after the first twenty, and sometimes after the first ten, minutes. 
“(3) Whole hour lessons had better results than two half hours. 
“More important for school hygiene than the experiments concerning over- 
taxation or overpressure are the recent, more clearly defined efforts at obtaining a 
standard for the selection, regulation, and thorough treatment of the branches of 
study by means of observations which refer to the manner of development of per-
-P-A-G-E-239
  
MENTAL FATIGUE IN SCHOOL. 1197 
ception and interest, as well as thought and speech of children. Such efforts 
require the greatest precaution and circumspection, but are likely to lead to better 
results. The study of the normal child is likely to be more successful than that of 
the abnormal, there being much more material at hand to judge from. 
“Lastly, the comprehensive development of pedagogical pathology belongs to the 
purely educational measures under discussion in the field of hygiene. In this case 
repeated exact observations and investigations of the intellectual growth of chil- 
dren in view of existing faults give us an insight into the world of the coming 
generation; in pursuance of the science of pathology, the thoughtful teacher inves- 
tigates the conditions under which he can best serve his pupils with reference to 
their mental and physical health, and in doing so benefits his country. The prob- 
lems that present themselves in this direction, namely, to determine mental faults 
in children and classify them according to their psychologic meaning, to trace their 
causes, to define the healthy juvenile mind, and to care for children by correcting 
and preventing their faults such problems invite the most zealous educational labor. 
Their solution aims at the foundation of salutary pedagogical school hygiene, sup- 
ported by thorough empiric, psychologic, and physiologic knowledge. 
“The medical science is hindered in all these directions from exerting any notice- 
able influence on education or on the control of educational methods. It is called 
upon only to cooperate in cases of such physical and mental phenomena in children 
as are beyond the teacher’s professional experience and opinion. Even then medi- 
cine can not act independently, for the sciences of anatomy, physiology, pathology, 
therapeutics, and dietetics for children can not aid the teacher in their purely medical 
character, as has in some instances been claimed; such knowledge must be turned 
to account specifically from pedagogical points of view, which means, ina manner _ 
conformable to the peculiar psychic development of children.” 
As the writers quoted in the foregoing pages indicate, the question of mental 
fatigue is closely allied with the movement in favor of child study. Indeed, it may 
be asserted that the investigations into the manifestations of fatigue have led some 
physiologists and psychologists to a more comprehensive study of children. It is 
therefore not astonishing to notice that medical men begin to bestow attention on 
the new movement of child study, as will be seen from the following extract from an 
article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which says editorially 
in its number of February 22, 1896: 
“While the leading idea of such study is undoubtedly psychologic, the subject is 
cuggestive in a medical point of view, and may well be worth an editorial comment 
in a journal that only deals with psychologic questions in their specially medical 
aspects and bearings. 
“There is no period of life when mental and physical development is as rapid as 
in childhood, and therefore there is none more interesting in a physiologic as well 
as in a psychologic point of view. Physicians have studied children in their patho- 
logic peculiarities; pediatrics is a recognized medical specialty, but it is a reason- 
able question whether it might not be as well to widen its scope and take into it 
some attention to the unfolding of the intellectual life in its beginnings. The skilled 
medical practitioner can better than anyone else first take note of and point out the 
way of correcting the morbid traits and tendencies that lead to physical and mental 
degeneracy; he can study and estimate the hereditary influences and advise how they 
are to be met, and can instruct the mother in what should be the most fascinating 
pursuit of her life—the proper method of studying the development of her offspring. 
These are the possibilities of the profession; we do not say they are generally or 
even often realized. . 
“Considering, however, only the physical side of the question of child study, it is 
not a credit to our profession that while the studies of the growth and the physical 
data of childhood are being taken up by laymen and educators, it should be in any 
degree behind them in the same line of investigation, While physiologists were ahead  
-P-A-G-E-240
1198 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
of psychologists in recognizing the value of knowledge of the earliest developmental 
processes and conditions in the study of functions, it seems now that the newer school 
of psychologists, enlightened by the data of physiology, may in their turn put prac- 
tical medicine under obligations for important facts and deductions. Sometimes 
they may be on the wrong track, or on one that is uncertain, but they are always 
suggestive and instructive in their modern methods. 
“The practical value of child study should be evident to anyone. The old saying 
that ‘as the twig is bent the tree is inclined,’ so often quoted with a moral application, 
has a physical and intellectual appropriateness as well. Hence every real acquisition 
of fact or legitimate theory in regard to the bodily or mental development of children 
~ has its value, and there is an ample store of such facts yet to be acquired. At the 
present time we may take, for example, the theories of mental and bodily degeneracy 
that are just now so much to the fore, and it is easy to see that they can only be proven 
or disproven by taking into consideration the earlier conditions of the individual and 
the influences that affected his development. The question as to the existence of such 
a type as the ‘born criminal’ is, as might be inferred from the term itself, one that 
can only be settled by the study of the development and beginnings as well as the 
finished type; in short, by a study of the morbid tendencies and moral development 
of the child. 
“As an almost purely medical line of investigation, and not the least important, may 
be mentioned that of heredity in children, which can hardly be studied by anyone 
so well as by the general practitioner—the family physician. Galton has laid down 
a plan for this line of research in his ‘Natural Inheritance’ that is at least worthy 
of some consideration. The amount of valuable facts and statistics that could be 
obtained from a general interest in this study in the medical profession can hardly be 
overestimated. Other interesting questions aresome of those of the origin of insanity, 
especially those forms that seem to be more or less dependent upon errors of education 
and training and management of developmental periods, and here the well-directed 
attention to the facts of early life will be found to be productive of valuable results, 
It is not meant to be understood that these questions are neglected by physicians, 
but more systematic study of all the stages of early human development is needed 
to fully elucidate them,” ‘

ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION IN AGRICULTURE IN RURAL SCHOOLS IN 
PRUSSIA. 
It is essential to point out a particular difference between the schools of monar- 
chicalGermany andrepublican France. New ideas, newneeds, new currents of thought 
or action appeal in France, as well as in America, directly to the common schools, 
while in Germany the minister of education holds his protecting hand over these 
schools, and points out to the reformers that new things and new methods may first 
prove their power to live by being applied in private, continuation and supplemen- 
tary, technical, professional, industrial, and agricultural schools. These are all 
schools which take the pupils after they have gone through the elementary schools, 
ive., after the fourteenth year of age. Hence we find nospecific agricultural instruc- 
tion in elementary schools in Germany, though we find physics, natural history, and 
not infrequently gardening taught in the upper grades of the elementary or people’s 
school. It is of more than passing interest to compare the subjoined courses of 
study for lessons in agriculture in German and French rural schools. 
A memorial presented to the Prussian Diet by the royal department of agriculture, 
in January, 1897, shows that for rural districts in Prussia not much is done in prepar- 
ing the rural population for their vocation, certainly not as much as is done in pre- 
paring artisans in cities. The industrial schools far outnumber the agricultural 
schools. The authors of the memorial say that the number of boys from 14 to 18 
years of age in rural districts of the Kingdom is 828,000, but the number of students 
in agricultural continuation or supplementary schools is only 13,317, while that of 
industrial and technical and trade schools is over 200,000. The department asks for 
more liberal appropriations for agricultural schools, and submits a course of study for 
such schools of an elementary grade, which course has been in successful operation 
in the school at Rybnik. It contains only the technical studies, besides which the 
ordinary common-school branches are taught with application to the conditions of 
rural life.

The French minister of public instruction and fine arts published in the Bulletin 
Administratif, January 2, 1897, the following guide for the instruction in agricul- 
ture in rural schools. It is very desirable to know just what is taught in such 
schools, hence a careful translation and a reproduction of the illustrations are here 
offered, as evidences of the consistent efforts of the European Governments in behalf 
of young people to furnish not only a general education, but also a preparation for 
practical pursuits. 
PLAN OF STUDY. 
The official circulars of October 24 and November 30, 1895, briefly outline a plan of 
study in the form of a practical guide, designed for the help of teachers in the ele- 
mentary instruction of agriculture, which subject is now compulsory (by the laws 
of June 16, 1879, article 10, and March 28, 1882, article 1). This plan, explained 
further on, is no more than a general sketch; nevertheless, teachers will find in it 
important directions, which should be followed by adapting the suggestions to their 
pupils and applying them to the local conditions of the district in which their 
school is situated.

  INSTRUCTION IN AGRICULTURE IN FRANCE. 1201 
PEDAGOGICAL DIRECTIONS, 
Elementary instruction in agriculture should be addressed less to the memory 
than to the intelligence of the children; it should be based on the observation of 
daily facts in country life and on simple experiments, applying material resources 
at hand, and designed to prove the scientific fundamental ideas of the most impor- 
tant agricultural operations. Children in rural schools should learn, above all 
things else, the reason of these operations, with an explanation of the accompanying 
phenomena, and not the details of the method of effects; still less, a list of precepts, 
definitions, or agricultural recipes. The first things for every agriculturalist to 
learn, things that must belearned by the experimental method, are the conditions 
essential for the growth of garden vegetables, the reasons for habitual work in com- 
mon farming, and the rules of hygiene governing man and domestic animals, 
No matter how well arranged a manual may be, a teacher would pursue a wrong 
course in the instruction of agriculture if he were to require his pupils to study and 
recite from the text-book. It is positively necessary to instruct by simple experi- 
ments, and above all, by observation. It is only by placing phenomena directly 
before them for observation that children can be taught to observe and fix in their 
minds the fundamental ideas on which modern agricultural science rests; children in 
the country are dependent upon schools for these ideas. It is useless to teach pupils 
what their fathers know better than the teacher and what they are sure to learn 
by their own practical experience. 
Schools should confine themselves to preparing children for an intelligent appren- 
ticeship in the calling that will yield them a livelihood and to cultivating in them 
a taste for their future profession. A teacher should never forget that the best way 
to make a workman love his work is to make him understand it. The end to be 
attained by elementary instruction in agriculture is to give the greatest number of 
children in rural districts the knowledge indispensable for reading a book on mod- 
ern agriculture, or attending an agricultural meeting with profit; to inspire them 
with the love of country life and the desire not to change it for the city or manufac- 
tories, and to inculcate the truth that the agricultural profession, the most inde- 
pendent of all, is more remunerative than many others for industrious, intelligent, 
and well-instructed followers. 
DISTRIBUTION OF TIME 
The end defined would be with difficulty attained were only that time devoted to 
agriculture which is especially reserved for it by the rules; in other words, were 
other subjects not studied correlatively in preparing children for their future life. 
In the country especially, teachers should adapt general education to the daily needs 
of the local population, giving the reading matter, language, and arithmetic a touch 
of agricultural knowledge. Pastoral poetry, occupations of rural life, problems in 
the form of simple accounts and referring to the cost of commodities bought and sold 
in the neighborhood, and to the mixtures and proportions of food of cattle, etc., are 
often valuable aids in the lessons on agriculture, as is shown in the division of time 
per week. 
The organized official method! specifies general conditions for a division of exer- 
cises in elementary schools. According to the plan of study proposed, “ two to three 
hours a week at least must be devoted to the physical and natural sciences (with 
their applications), studied at first under the form of object lessons and continued in 
a regular methodic course later on.” / 
The prescribed regulations do not distinguish between the sciences on the one 
hand and agriculture on the other; for instance, it is not necessary, during the 
whole year, to reserve one of the two hours for the sciences and the rest of the time 
for agriculture. The distribution of subjects on the dual programme published in 
1 Enactment of January 18, 1887, article 19.
-P-A-G-E-244
  1202 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
connection with the official method should be arranged with respect to the facilities 
for demonstration offered by the seasons and the weather. All that relates to vege- 
table life and development (processes in the course of demonstration in garden and 
field, out-of-door lessons in agriculture) should be reserved for the spring and sum- 
mer; that is to say, should be included in the programme of study for the second 
semester; the rest belongs to the winter semester. 
The division of exercises referred to later on accords with this condition, at the 
same time preserving a logical and methodic connection. If the first ideas of clemen- 
tary science are properly presented and can be depended upon as the foundation of 
agricultural and horticultural ideas and for the first principles of hygiene, the two 
or three hours allotted a week will suffice for the rational application of the pro- 
: gramme under the condition of not advancing these ideas beyond the pupil’s com- 
prehension, 
COMMENT ON THE OFFICIAL PROGRAMME. 
In obedience to the law,' most of the departmental councils have arranged special 
programmes of instruction in agriculture for the schools of the respective depart- 
ment (province). Exaggeration is a fault common to nearly all of them. 
We must not fail in a just appreciation of the character of elementary instruction; 
strictly speaking, this can not be professional. All that can be required of teachers 
in rural schools is to cultivate the taste for agricultural matters in their pupils, and 
teach them to understand them as far as their age permits. The general programme 
in defining a coordinate branch of instruction (physics and agriculture) may, without 
crowding of subjects, include physical and natural sciences, agriculture, hygiene, 
and domestic economy for girls, studies that should correlate and mutually sup- 
plement one another. s 
We shall examine the nature of the lessons defined in the official programme for 
each of the three courses and for every semester in rural schools. The whole forms 
asketch of what the majority of pupils must know to be graduated. 
ELEMENTARY COURSE. 
(Children 7 to 9 years of age.) 
Object lessons in this course are a continuation of those set apart for infant classes 
and infant schools,? but from an agricultural point of view; objects from the garden 
are simply ranked with class objects. 
IN 
  RMEDIATE COURSE, 
(Children 9 to 11 years of age.) 
The length of the intermediate course is to be at least two years. In the first 
year, that is to say, at 9 years of age, a child can acquire only very rudimentary 
scientific knowlege and begin to apply it to affairs of agriculture. But in the sec- 
_ond year of this course the first ideas of agriculture, properly speaking, can be 
obtained. According to the prescribed regulations, these ideas should be offered in 
connection with reading, object lessons, and excursions. 
This division into two years presents no difficulty for schools of several grades. 
In the country, where schools for the most part have but one teacher, lessons in 
science and agriculture are generally given to the whole school. These lessons neces- 
sarily embrace information adapted to each group of pupils and form a kind of con- 
centric instruction from which each pupil imbibes a part proportioned to the caliber 
and development of his mind. 
A teacher does his duty well if his pupils, according to the division to which they 
belong, acquire the knowledge defined for each course.

FIRST YEAR OF THE INTERMEDIATE COURSE. 
First semester.—It would be difficult to give an idea of the principal functions of 
life, to speak with effect, for instance, on respiration to children ignorant of the 
properties of air, doubting even its being a material thing. We should then begin 
with a preliminary examination of the three states of matter. The natural sciences

Jifth oxygen. 
furnish subjects for parallel lessons mutually supplementary. In natural history 
wo should begin with brute animals; the study of man should follow upon the 
empiric knowledge relative to air and combustion. 
1. The three states of matler.—Several simple demonstrations are indispensable for 
observing and comparing these three states. The following experiments can be 
made without expense. Immerse a glass in water; also a funnel with the mouth at  
-P-A-G-E-246
1204 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
the bottom. We either see or feel the air escape. Collect under water air forced 
from a bellows or exhalation from the lungs; decant and measure it approximately. 
_ Produce steam and condense it; in other words, distill water and observe the changes 
of state. Generate a little oxygen, produce combustion, maintain it by means of a 
draft, and observe the results. Prove atmospheric pressure and elasticity of air. 
The rest may follow later. We suggest the form of experiments easily made. 
2, Animals.—The curiosity of children should be excited by conversations—familiar 
discussions on animals well known to them. Teachers should point out the most 
striking facts in their histories. The dog and the horse may be subjects of several 
illustrated lessons. The principal varieties of dogs may be compared and the points 
of resemblance treated between the horse and the ass, the cat and the tiger and the 
lion. The habits of domestic fowls; the swallows’ periodical travels and those of 
other migratory birds; the metamorphoses of the frog; those of the May bug and 
its ravages; the silkworm, bees, and their products, etc, are subjects full of interest 
for conversations. 
3. Man.—The description of the 
human body should follow the 
lessons on animals; it might be 
begun before the close of the 
experimental lessons justreferred 
to, but only after the treatment 
of the fanctions of nutrition and 
respiration, to which a few re- 
marks on hygiene may be added, 
have been discussed, 
Second senester.—The season 
permits collecting the objects 
necessary for demonstrations; 
either the teacher or the pupils 
should bring them to the class, 
or the lessons should be con- 
ducted near the objects them- 
selves. In the country no object 
lesson on plants or lesson in 
botany should be given without 
the objects being before the eyes 
of the pupils. 
1. Plants.—Naturally, chil- 
dren’s attention should first of all be directed to the active phenomenon of germina- 
tion, easily produced and followed through its diverse phases, especially in the spring. 
A bean or a grain of wheat, an acorn or a horse-chestnut, planted in moss or damp 
soil may serve for the experiment. To make the experiment ordinarily adopted for 
growth in water the seed is attached to a floating cork. The development of the 
rootlets and their essential organs, the crown and rodt-hairs, is easily seen. 
Figure 7 shows how the experiment can be made, and the results obtained at about 
the end of a month. 
The stem and the flower, especially the latter, should likewise be studied from 
nature, A specimen of the subject chosen should be given to each pupil. Under 
the teachers’ direction the parts of the flower—calix, corolla, stamens, and pistil (see 
fig. 8)—should be separated by means of a knife ora long pin. A few examples well 
chosen will suffice to give an idea of the character of several families particularly 
interesting because of their good or bad qualities (useful or noxious plants). 
2. Pirst ideas of agricultwre.—With children under ten years of age these ideas, to 
be profitable, must be restricted; they are merely initiatory in preparing a child for 
observation and familiarizing it with the technical terms employed in the more 
systematical lessons of the following years.         
        
    
  
  
  
    
      
7. Growth in water. 
Germination of a dicotyl (radish) and of a monocotyl (oats) ; 
roots with crown and hairs which absorb the water.

SECOND YEAR OF THE INTERMEDIATE COURSE, 
The plan to be followed is essentially the same as in the first year. The program 
is completed as follows: 
1. Ideas of science.—The study of combustion should extend to that of carbonic 
acid gas, which should be proved to exist in calcareous rocks. Some lime and a few

8. Arrangement of the pupil’s work, 
A good way to make these lessons profitable is to arrange and paste the different parts of the flower 
analyzed on a piece of paper, explaining the natural forms by means of a diagram. The foregoing 
illustration is an exact reproduction of a page in the copy book of a child eleven years old. 
drops of a mineral acid suffice for the following experiments or demonstrations, 
Convert the lime into quick-lime (the stove in the class-room will furnish sufficient 
heat for all the pupils to convince themselves); demonstrate the loss of weight by 
comparison with another piece of limestone similar to the first; observe the action 
of water on quicklime and properties of slack-lime, and whiting-size and lime

water; produce carbonic acid gas (see fig. 9), and let the pupil reconstruct the lime- 
stone in theory and practice. 
The mechanical separation of vegetable earth (A) into clay (B) on the one hand

separated; the carbonate of lime (E) can finally be regenerated by means of a solu- 
tion of carbonate of soda. This experiment is easily explained and requires little 
eare to be conveniently carried out. It is advisable to preserve the results and note 
them down on a card, as shown in fig. 10. 
2. Ideas of agriculture.—Examination of the principal kinds of soil, especially 
during walks. Children should be taught to observe that plants, like animals, 
require nourishment. For this purpose a few growing plants in pots or garden plots 
are needed. The following experiment is the first in order. Sow some seeds of rap- 
idly growing plants—early beans, for instance. (Fig. 11.) 
In the pot to the left exhausted soil without manure is used. In the pot to the right 
good soil, with a sufficient quantity of manure added, is used. The necessity of 
manure will be thus demonstrated. The knowledge of its composition follows 
later on. 
The first ideas of common agricultural implements and labor are best gained 
during walks. They are developed in the more systematic lessons referred to in the 
programme of the advanced course. 
  11. Experimental growth in sterile and in fertile soil. 
Strictly speaking, the advanced course is rarely organized in rural schools. Ordi- 
narily, the oldest or more advanced pupils form what may be called a higher division 
of the intermediate course. However the case may be, the rule to be observed is as 
follows: 
Children of 12 or 13 years of age should receive more advanced instruction in agri- 
culture than that which is indicated in the programme of the intermediate course. 
For the largest pupils the teacher should add to what has preceded all that he can 
add of the following programme, the application of which will present no serious 
difficulty, provided ideas of fundamental science have been established by means of 
simple experiments in the class room and in observation of nature, 
ADVANCED COURSE. 
(Children 11 to 13 years of age.) 
The ideas from physical and natural science presented in this course are, first, an 
extension of those of the intermediate course. The extension bears essentially on 
facts of hygiene as applied to man and domestic animals, on ideas of vegetable 
physiclogy, and on some elements of organic chemistry. The subjects of lessons are 
defined for each semester, the natural and physical sciences being confined to the 
winter and taught in parallel lessons so as to correlate. 
First semester.—(1) Animals.—The distinguishing traits of classification should be 
defined by means of examples taken as far as possible from among native animals,
-P-A-G-E-249
INSTRUCTION IN AGRICULTURE IN FRANCE. 1207 
either useful or destructive, according to preference. Domestic animals naturally 
rank first. The facts upon which rules of hygiene and the feeding of cattle are 
based should be considered above all other things. 
A study of the principal organs may be facilitated by the direct observation of a 
dead animal. Some teachers know how to prepare the digestive apparatus of smaller 
animals, and even skeletons, by means of which the school museum is enriched. Their 
example deserves commendation. 
(2) Man.—The ideas of anatomy should be primarily directed toward convincing 
children of the necessity of the rules of hygiene. They bear essentially on diges- 
tion, circulation, respiration, and the relation of the senses to the nervous system. 
Exaggeration should be avoided. All recipes, more or less empiric, are not to be 
confounded with hygiene, still less with medicine, and should be omitted. 
(3) Physics.—The experiments necessary are simple and cheap. This part of the 
programme should be developed, particularly in cities and industrial centers, In 
the country demonstrations may be confined to proving the principal effects of heat, 
light, electricity, and gravitation. In this case it is of importance to excite the 
children’s curiosity and to select examples from among phenomena easily reproduced 
or observed; others should not be mentioned unless the first series be exhausted. 
Somo ideas of meteorology are necessary. Children should become familiar, not 
with the construction of the barometer and thermometer, but with the indications 
furnished by these instruments and the man- 
ner of noting them; they should even be 
tanght to read the meteorological bulletins. 
(4) Chemistry.—There are numerous experi- 
ments easily carried out with very limited 
material. Figure 12 represents the best and 
most easily mounted of all minor apparatuses, 
with which any elementary school may be fur- 
nished. It cam be made anywhere, and suffices 
to extract, for instance, alcohol from a fer- 
mented drink and ammonia from mineral 
fertilizers and even liquid manure. 
From among practical experiments those 
should be chosen which refer directly to agri- 12, ‘Distilling apparatus. — Prepara: 
culture; substances which serve as nourish- tion of ammonia. 
ment to plants are the most important. 
Potash should be extracted from wood ashes; a calcined bone should be converted 
into soluble phosphate by bringing it into contact with diluted hydrochloric acid, 
and reconverted into insoluble phosphate by neutralizing the acid used by a base, 
or simply by means of carbonate of soda. With the aid of limestone, ammonia should 
be detected in the salts of which it is a constituent and which are used as fertilizers. 
Pupils should learn to distinguish among the principal commercial fertilizers, nitrates 
of ammoniac and potassic salts, hypophosphates of scorie, ete. It is important that 
the precise meaning of each scientific term, current in the language of agriculture 
to-day, be understood by pupils about to leave rural schools. 
The knowledge of the principal fertilizers will be greatly facilitated by the 
use made of them during the summer semester in experiments of demonstrative 
growth. 
(5) Minerals.—Facts relative to soil, rocks, and earths, should be taught partly in 
object lessons with the aid of objects from the school museum, and in connection 
with experiments in chemistry, partly and principally during outdoor lessons in 
agriculture. 
(6) Agriculture and horticulture.—Lessons in these branches should begin before 
spring. They should bear on all interesting subjects, especially local crops. As far 
as possible, a lesson should refer to things seen or objects already examined by the 
pupils. Teachers should begin with subjects touched upon in the intermediate 
     
-P-A-G-E-250
  1208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
course that have already been explained in connection with reading matter and dur- 
ing walks. 
During the whole summer season, lessons should be in close connection with practi- 
cal exercises, excursions into the neighborhood, etc. The subject of each lesson on 
agriculture and horticulture should be that of the last or that of the next walk, or 
that of a practical exercise assigned for the same period. 
Second semester.—(1) Demonstrative growth.—The experi- 
ments should be prepared and conducted in a manner to 
prove the following fundamental maxims: 
(a) Air should be allowed to easily penetrate into the 
soil, as roots can not dispense with oxygen; they breathe 
like leaves, They should find appropriate nourishment— 
that is to say, fertilizers should be mixed with earth so 
as to enter into all parts of the soil in which roots develop. 
(b) In all arable land four substances—azote, phosphoric 
acid, potash, and lime—suffice for the complete nourish- 
ment and perfect development of vegetable life.

furthermore, acts efficaciously on the nutritive substances 
contained in the soil, so that dung is the first fertilizer recommended for earth in the 
best condition to furnish the four elements in appropriate proportion; appropriate 
chemical fertilizers are afterwards added. 
(d) A fertilizer is good for soil, if it supplies what is wanting for the maintenance 
of vegetable life. The composition of a good fertilizer depends, not only upon the 
kind of culture for which it is intended, but also 
upon the nature of the ground. It is impossible 
to prepare a fertilizer appropriate to all soils, for 
even one single kind of plant. Formulas, or 
recipes, termed infallible and generally appli- 
cable, deserve no more confidence than quack 
remedies alleged to cure all diseases. 
(e) To obtain remunerative harvests, the soil, 
after having been fertilized, must contain the 
four nutritive substances in proportion depend- 
      ent upon the kind of plant cultivated. The a

very clementary, but fundamental, should be 
made in pots, or, better, in boxes with the children’s aid. The above illustrations, 
reproduced from photographs taken from nature, show the simplest arrangements 
successfully carried out in numerous schools. 
The experiment represented by figure 13 proves that the four substances dissolved 
in the water of the bottle suffice to bring the plant to maturity. If no air is allowed
-P-A-G-E-251
  
, INSTRUCTION IN AGRICULTURE IN FRANCE. 1209 
to penetrate into the water of the flask, the oxygen indispensable for the roots will 
be wanting and the plant will perish. 
Figure 14 shows one of the simplest means of proving that if one of the nutritive 
elements be found only in very small quantity (all arable land, even the poorest, 
always contains a little of each of the four elements) vegetation suffers noticeably. 
The experiment represented by figure 15 is the starting point of the field of demon- 
stration. More complicated than the preceding, it may also be made in pots or in 
boxes, or better still in a garden plat, if the soil be of good physical quality but 
greatly impoverished of nutritive elements. It is very important in point of view 
of the demonstration of the fundamental truths referred to above. It shows the

immense differences in the harvests from the same field in case the fertilizer responds, 
or not, to the composition of the soil or the wants of the plant. It does not permit 
an estimate of the production, for it is a qualitative, not a quantitative experiment, 
but it suffices to show in a striking manner that the excess of an element is just as 
detrimental as its insufficiency. 
Observations.—Precautions to be observed in growing plants in pots: Pots used for 
demonstrative growth are and should be made of porous clay ; consequently there 
is rapid evaporation, necessitating frequent watering. Placing the pots in suffi- 
ciently deep saucers or troughs, into which water is poured, provides sufficient 
moisture for several days, even during warm and dry periods.
-P-A-G-E-252
1210 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Holes large enough to contain the pots may also be dug in the garden. One should 
avoid overheating, likely to take place in the neighborhood of a wall in consequence 
of radiation, and which rapidly withers the plants used in the experiment. 
To avoid superficial hardness of the earth caused by repeated watering, the pots 
may be covered with a light bed of moss, thin straw, or sawdust; coarse sand or 
gravel will do, too. 
No. Lis the ‘‘evidence” without fertilizer. No.2 received a fertilizer formed of 2 
grams of nitrate of sodium a, 3 grams of hypophosphate of lime b, and 1 gram of 
chloride of potassium ¢ to 1 kilogram of soil. No.3 received a and ¢; No. 4, b and 
¢; No.5,a and. No. 3 gave more straw and less grain than the “evidence” No, 1; 
hence the fertilizer was detrimental. It was useless in No. 4. 
The foregoing experiments, prepared in such a way that they can be brought into 
the class room during lessons, should be repeated in a garden plot in connection with 
experiments in kitchen gardening. Arrangements must be made for those important 
experiments that supply in a certain measure the place of fields of demonstration 
where these can not be made. 
For instance, transplant cabbage or lettuce plants in: three adjoining furrows. 
The first furrow should receive no fertilizer; the second, on the contrary, should be 
liberally provided with a fertilizer equally qualified for the soil and for the plant; 
the third should receive either a ferti- 
lizer deficient in one of the elements, 
orplainmanure, Figure 16 represents 
the results obtained from an experi- 
ment of this kind. The weights of 
heads vary according to the furrow in 
which they were grown. 
Two other important clementary ex- 
periments that can be made in pots or 
boxes deserve very especial mention. 
The first (fig. 17) proves that the liquid 
and gaseous products escaping from 
manure have great fertilizing proper- 
ties; the second (fig. 18) demonstrates 
the absorbing properties of land or soil. 
Transplant cabbage plants in three furrows—A in ‘Three flowerpots filled with ordinary 
manure, Bin manure enriched with mineral ferti- 6 4>4h nearly sterileandsown with grass

a plant from each one of the furrows. or a cereal suffice for each of the ex- periments. One of the three pots (C) 
seryes as ‘‘evidenco” and receives only plain water; the second (B) receives liquid 
manure; the third may receive only the grass liberated from manure and liquid manure 
(see figure 17) by fermentation, or it may receive liquid manure first and then be 
abundantly watered. Watering does not lessen its fertility (figure 18). 
The value of fertilizing matter lost annually in France exceeds 500,000,000 franes (5 
francs to the dollar). A great service would be rendered to agriculturists by persuad- 
ing them that the first practical progress, without increase of funds, consists in dimin- 
ishing this enormous loss. The preceding experiments prove this evident loss. Ifthey 
are concluded with precise indications, appositely given, of poor or rich manure, the 
chances are that the lesson will bear fruit. Teachers can do a great deal, by means 
of a few lessons in school, toward clearing the streets of our villages of the streams of 
liquid manure that infect the atmosphere, defile the waters of springs and wells 
instead of fertilizing fields in the country where the laborer, negligent in collecting it, 
complains of the insufficiency of his crops. 
The experiments just referred to are the necessary foundation of all instruction in 
agriculture; they ought to be carried out in all rural schools at least once every two 
years, so that all children over 11 years of age may have had the benefit of following 
them. These experiments, or others similar to them, require little care, and cost

  almost nothing; they forma natural and necessary introduction to those following 
in the field of demonstration. 
(2) Field of demonstration.—Experiments can not be too prudently organized. Their 
chief end is to teach agriculturists what to do with given soils, to obtain more remu- 
nerative production than that which results under ordinary circumstances. It must 
not be forgotten that the same formulas do not apply to all cases. The fertilizer best 
adapted for the plant to be cultivated is that which contains what is wanting in the 
soil for its nourishment.

17. Fert ng power of liquid and gaseous products from manure. 
Grass is sown in three pots. Pot A has received liquid manure; B received the gas liberated from the 
fermented manure in the bottle; C has received nothing. Air is renewed in the bottle by forcing it 
in at S, either by means of a bellows attached to a rubber tube or otherwise. 
  A knowledge of the soil, consequently, is necessary in order to determine what 
fertilizing elements should be used in conducting the experiments. Teachers do 
well in following the advice of specialists or well-instructed practical farmers. Too 
much fertilizing should be avoided under all circumstances; common local custom 
should be the basis of comparison. The simplest field demonstrations should always 
accord with the three following divisions (figure 19) : 
    
      
    
      
  
    18. Power of absorption in arable land. 
The carth in boxes numbered 1 and 2 has imbibed liquid manure. Box 1 was afterwards abund- antly watered by rain. Number 3 received no nourishment; it was used as “‘ evidence.”

II. Manure alone in the proportion in common local use (from 10 to 30 tons to the 
hectare, about 2 acres). 
Ill. The samo quantity of manure, and in addition complementary fertilizers pro- 
ortioned according to the nature of the soil and that of the plants to be cultivated.  
-P-A-G-E-254
  1212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Under the head of supplementary lessons, and in different divisions, the nature of 
the fertilizer in the third division might be varied by leaving out one or more of the 
constituent elements. In the field of demonstration the teacher acts as a collabo- 
trator of the work of the official professor of agriculture. However, in his efforts to 
raise the best kinds of vegetables and fruits the most conclusive experiments are 
made in his own garden. This one particular point should receive special mention; 
the culture of fruit and garden vegetables offers useful work in his own sphere, 
besides being a source of personal profit. 
The participation of pupils in the preceding work should depend upon their age, 
manual skill, and knowledge of the sciences. It is difficult to lay down any fixed 
rule in this respect. In some instances the majority of pupils may take part as mere 
Jookers on in the cutting and grafting of fruit trees. In others, the older pupils may 
themselves manipulate the pruning knife, and even acquire the dexterity necessary 
for obtaining a diploma of grafter. Sometimes all take a hand in watering and 
weeding, ete., a garden plot devoted to experiments. All that is required is reason- 
able practice, and that manual labor and intellectual work be combined. 
(3) Out-of-door lessons in agriculture, or agricultural excursions.—They serve as a 
preparation for, and a complement to, the lessons given in the class room on minerals,

rocks, principal kinds of native soil, insects, useful or noxious plants, the essential] 
operations of growth, the manipulation of agricultural implements, the spreading} 
of fertilizers, the sowing of seed, the gathering of crops, etc. 
The application of scientific knowledge derived or to be derived in the regular 
lessons is what is to be gained from the observation and occasional examination o 
agricultural operations. It is not enough, for instance, to show how earth is mel 
lowed by plowing; it should be clearly explained how breaking up the soil facilitate 
the development of roots, brings them into contact with the fertilizers, insures t 
them by consequent aeration the necessary amount of oxygen for their respiration, 
etc. Mostof the other agricultural operations should be explained in the same way. 
Attention is called to the principal subjects of study, to the nature of the observa. 
tions to be made in walks, and to the practical exercises for the intermediate an 
advanced courses, as follows: 
Plowing.—Arrangement of the different parts of the plow; how the cutter ani 
plowshare break up the earth which is turned back or over by the mold board, thu: 
causing a furrow; distance from the edge of the cutter to that of the plowshar 
according to the tenacity of the soil. How the soil is mellowed; its aeration; it 
 
-P-A-G-E-255

, INSTRUCTION IN AGRICULTURE IN FRANCE. 1213 
mixture with fertilizers; the utilization of the moisture in the subsoil. How the 
depth of the plow is regulated. Date and frequency of plowing according to season; 
plowing in fallow land and worked land. 
Harrowing and rolling.—Arrangement of the teeth of the harrow; effects produced 
by them; superficial leveling and pulverization; consequences of sudden rain, 
according to whether the earth may be argillaceous or siliceous; if hardening is pro- 
duced it impedes aeration. Action of the harrow on seed beds, on dog grass, and other 
weeds. Breaking of clods by the roller; leveling to facilitate later mowing; add- 
ing new earth to the winter cereals that have been lifted up by frosts. Date of 
\ harrowing and rolling. 
Use of fertilizers.—Treatment and spreading of manure. Divers fertilizers. Use 
before and after plowing. Fertilizers used broadcast on cultivated ground, prairies, 
meadows; effects of manure in hotbeds. 
Sowing of seeds.—Conditions necessary for germination; influence of the depth of 
the seed bed. The date of sowing. Quantity of seed; quality to be selected. 
Cutting and grafting of fruit trees, shrubs, and vines.—In the vineyards ravaged by 
the phylloxera the grafting of grape vines receives special attention. 
Particular kinds of soils.—Dressing the earth, developing adventitious roots; sec- 
ond tilling; weeding and other destruction of weeds; aeration of superficial roots; 
danger of too deep a dressing for certain plants, vines, etc. 
Distribution and rotation of crops.—Succession of plants with long or deep roots to 
those with superficial or short roots; nitrates again found in the subsoil. Fresh 
fertilizers. Fallow ground. 
Crops.—Principal operations; treatment in barns, preservation; estimates of the 
crops of a country. 
Manipulations of implements, such as rakes worked with horsepower, mowers, reap- 
ers, sowers, thrashers, sorters, chaff and straw cutting machines, etc., are interesting 
subjects for explanation, given either by the teacher or the practical agriculturist 
employed. . 
To sum up all in a few words, explanations of agricultural operations in fields or 
vineyards, in barns or cellars, in stables or poultry yards should be based upon 
observation; they should aid lessons in the schoolroom and form the substance of 
written reviews. Notes of appropriate reading matter are to be compared with 
actual observations. 
Pupils leaving the elementary school necessarily have only rudimentary ideas of 
the science of agriculture, even though their attendance has been normal and regular; 
but if the study has been made attractive and interesting, they will continue it even 
under disadvantages. 
The introduction in popular libraries of well-chosen books on agriculture and 
special publications on local crops constitutes one of the means for this end, but it 
is inadequate, The adult must not only preserve, but perfect and enlarge the knowl+ 
edge gained in boyhood. When there are no long interruptions facility and skill 
will come with age. The zeal of teachers who open classes for their former pupils 
during the long winter evenings can not be too much encouraged, and should be sup- 
ported. Familiar discourses, popular lectures, well-selected practical exercises, con- 
ferences for experiments and projects, held from time to time, arouse intellectual 
effort in young men very profitable to the progress of the country. 
As-with all other instruction, so with that in agriculture, the work of schools remains 
very imperfect if it be not continued. It will have no practical result if the interest 
in 1t is not kept up and the study continued.

SWITZERLAND.

countries. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 
When, in 1806, Napoleon defeated the army of Prussia, the Prussian Govern- 
ment, prompted by Queen Louise, resolved to regain its power and influence by 
quickening the intelligence of the people and awakening political consciousness 
and patriotic feeling by means of renewed efforts in systematic public education. 
The result was magical, and the effect is visible to-day in the record of achieve- 
inents, beginning with the battle on the Katzbach and ending at Waterloo, and 
latterly at Sedan. Field Marshal Moltke justly said, ‘‘ The schoolmaster has won 
our battles.” 
When, in 1876, at the World’s Fair in Philadelphia, Germany found herself 
beaten by other nations in the field of art and industry, the courageous German 
commissioner, Professor Reuleaux, cabled to Prince Bismarck: ‘‘ Our goods are 
cheap, but wretched.” This determined the governmentsof the twenty-six German 
states to try the Prussian manner of regaining lost ground by means of education 
of the people. The means of this were available owing to the enormous war 
indemnity paid by France. The result of this educational campaign in less than 
twenty years far surpassed the most extravagant expectations. The World’s 
Fair in Chicago proved conclusively that Germany occupies a place in the front 
rank of industrial nations, and such books as ‘Made in Germany” show that that 
country is successfully competing with France end England in the world’s markets. 
A few striking facts gleaned from the statistics in ‘‘Made in Germany” may 
prove the rapid growth of Germany’s commerce. The intervals of time stated are 
not always the same in the following table:

The steam tonnage of the German merchant marine has increased as follows:

The effective tonnage (including sailing vessels) amounted to 4,214,385 tons in 
1893 and 4,573,526 tons in 1894. This shows an increase of 8 to 9 per cent, while 
the increase of English tonnage during the same year was 3} per cent. 
Says Mr. S. N. D. North, the secretary of the National Association of Wool Man- 
ufacturers, in an article in the Forum: ‘‘The record of German progress is most 
significant. Applying the test usually applied, we find that German commerce 
has increased from $180,000,000 in 1850 to $815,000,000 in 1889, the percentage of 
increase being 350 as compared with 150 per cent of increase in British commerce. 
Admitting that these percentages are not a fair test, it must nevertheless be agreed 
that German progress has been much the faster of the two, and very much faster 
when we consider the relative disadvantages under which Germany started in the 
race. In twenty years Germany had doubled her exports and lifted herself toa 
point of vantage equal to that at which England started in 1846. In twenty years 
more she has attained an industrial development on a par with that of England 
in practically every line of manufacturing, in many lines surpassing it. German 
ambition sets no limit on the progress of the future, for it looks upon the develop- 
ment of the half century as merely preliminary and preparatory.” 
These facts are indications of the enormous industrial activity going on in Ger- 
many, an activity which has been developed chiefly since the Franco-German war. 
At first the various governments of Germany proceeded by setting afoot a num- 
ber of inquiries into the causes of the evident inferiority, and found (1) that the 
requisite technical knowledge was wanting among the laborers, a knowledge 
which could be acquired only in suitable schools; (2) that every industry, if suc- 
cessful in the world’s markets, relies upon the technical knowledge and ability 
accumulated in a community by years of skilled labor, not to say transmitted 
from father to son; hence that special excellence in any branch of industry is a 
result of both technical schooling and acquired skill. Instances are the cutlery 
industry at Solingen, the silk industry at Crefeld, the toy industry in Thuringia 
and Saxony, and the furniture industry at Berlin. 
The commissioners, examining into the causes of the German industrial deca- 
dence, agreed that the excellent results of the French textile industries and the 
great value of the product of French art industry were owing not only to great 
innate talents of French laborers, but also to their thorough and very appropriate

pose” has been going on in France from the time of Colbert, the minister of 
finance during the reign of Louis XIV. Indisputable evidences of this were fur- 
nished by the various world’s expositions, which opened the eyes of intelligent 
Germans to the inadequacy of the institutions for industrial education prior to 
1876. It may be said that German industry thereupon took an upward start most 
gratifying in its results, since it was consistently planned and aided by the estab- 
lishment of a large number of institutions for technical and industrial pursuits. 
These institutions are of a threefold kind: (1) elementary industrial schools, 
which prepare the broad mass of laboring people; (2) secondary industrial schools, 
which prepare the foremen and designers, and (3) higher institutions, like poly- 
- technical and art schools, which prepare engineers and industrial leaders. Of 
course there were already in existence some schools of each kind previous to 1876; 
put the State governments now began to foster industrial education by subsidizing 
schools established for that purpose. The communities usually furnished build- 
ings and adequate equipment, and paid for light and fuel, and the State would 
then defray a large part, and in many cases all, of the expenses needed for salaries 
of teachers, 
It was deemed unwise to introduce purely technical (industrial or agricultural) 
work into the common school, but efforts were made to draw into the sphere of 
infiuence of a systematic industrial training boysand girls who had passed through 
the common school; hence, all schools for special training admit only students 
over 14 years of age. An imperial law (that is, a law which is effective in all the 
26 States of the Empire) prohibits the employment of children under 16 years in 
factories and workshops; hence arose the establishment of numerous ‘‘continua- 
tion or supplementary schools,” designed to prevent the results of elementary 
school education from being lost, and to add industrial features which would be 
serviceable to the students in the choice of occupations or professions. 
These elementary schools are mostly evening or secular Sunday schools; in some 
instances they have developed into day schools. Many of these special schools, 
being situated in rural communities, are agricultural schools. Many communities 
have found it to be to their interest to make attendance at these schools compul- 
sory for boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 16, and certain States make this 
possible by law. Thus the German child of the humbler strata of society is pre- 
vented from forgetting his early education before he takes up his life’s work, and 
is systematically trained to work in directions that will lead to his ultimate self- 
support. 
In order not to injure the system by uniformity, the State leaves it to the com: 
munity to determine what industrial features shall be taught, being fully aware 
of the fact that each industrial center has local needs not duplicated by any other. 
For the same reason this system of industrial schools is not under the jurisdiction 
of the minister of public education, but under that of the minister of commerce 
and industry. The agricultural supplementary schools are under the control of 
the minister of agriculture. This may in some instances lead to duplication of 
efforts, but the economic administration of the States in the German Empire pre- 
vents confusion in this direction by giving the supervision of such schools into the 
hands of master workmen of acknowledged skill, unblemished character, and local 
prominence. This much is submitted concerning the elementary part of the Ger- 
man industrial system of education. 
The State authorities were not satisfied with providing for elementary work; 
they also encouraged the communities to establish secondary industrial schools, 
chiefly ‘‘schools of design,” in which drawing and mathematics claim three- 
fifths of the time devoted to study. These ‘‘Gewerbe-schulen,” all of which 
are day and evening schools, are found only in large industrial centers of the 
Empire. They have exerted an influence upon the laboring community far

1218 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
beyond anything expected of them. Each of these schoo!s has a preparatory 
department with a one year’s course. In this department the student is brought 
face to face with an almost bewildering variety of designs and occupations, at 
any or all of which he may try his hand. Soon he finds his favorite occupation, 
if he has not previously developed a special liking. Toward the end of the year 
he has, in most cases, a decided leaning in one direction, and the professors foster 
it by giving the pupil work to do that will help him on in his chosen specialty. 
One feature in the study of drawing is that there is no copying done; most of the 
work is from solids. Copies are sometimes placed before the pupils, but they are 
to be reproduced on a larger or a smaller scale. These schools rarely have work- 
shops, but most of the students, being apprentices or journeymen laborers in fac- 
tories or workshops, can make models at home or in the shop after designs made 
in school; and master workmen encourage this model making in their shops, for 
in most cases the results of new ideas and inventions benefit the place where they 
are made, 
Side by side with these schools of design there are actual ‘‘ trade schools,” also 
of a secondary character. These are not, like the ‘‘Gewerbe-schulen,” schools 
of industrial art—that is, nurseries of invention and design—but are intended to 
directly aid the trades by shortening the period of apprenticeship and developing 
skill in manual labor. Naturally the mental work of these schools consists in 
mathematics, drawing, and commercial science, besides giving the various bear- 
ings of each trade taught. These advanced trade schools are found in industrial 
centers only. While higher agricultural, forestry, and mining schools are taken 
care of exclusively by the State, the trade schools are established by the commu- 
nities and generously subsidized by the State. 
All the schools mentioned—(a) elementary industrial and agricultural schools 
(so-called supplementary schools), (b) schools of design for the industrial arts, 
and (c) purely trade schools—are specially designed to aid the community in 
which and by which they are established. The State, as such, does not establish 
them. They form no uniform system; no two of them have the same course of 
study, nor is the course of study of any of these schools intended to remain 
unchanged. It is changed as often as necessity and the demands of the locality 
require. 
Another feature of this movement for industrial supremacy is this: When 
skilled labor had been multiplied and the German nation began to be successful 
in industries in which formerly other nations had a monopoly, it was found nec- 
essary to find markets in foreign countries for goods which could not be consumed 
by the home market. Germany entered the lists in competing for the world’s 
markets. The commercial leaders of the Empire, especially the great mercantile 
houses in Bremen, Hamburg, Lubeck, Frankfort, Munich, Cologne, Breslau, Leip- 
sic, and Stettin, had foreseen the necessity of a trained army of commercial agents 
well versed in languages. Hence, simultaneous with the expansion of industrial 
education, a large number of commercial schools were opened which trained their 
students in languages, bookkeeping, and commercial science. 
Most of these schools have a study in their curriculum called ‘‘ Waarenkunde’ 
(knowledge of merchandise), which term means more thanit conveys. It includes 
a study of modes and ways of shipping and transporting according to the wishes 
and needs of the customers. One instance may illustrate this: Flour is imported 
into Central America from Germany, instead of from the United States, simply 
because the shrewd German merchants adapt their mode of packing to the fact 
that the mode of transport in Central America is the mule’s back; hence they send 
flour in narrow sacks several feet long, which can be slung over the mule’s back, 
In other countries the millers still persist in packing flour in barrels or short 
sacks, both of which are inconvenient to transport in hilly Central America. 
These commercial schools of Germany train clerks for correspondence in almost

any living language, and since Germany entered (in 1872) the list of nations 
which adopted the metric system, the weights and measures cause no difficulty in 
filling orders from abroad. England and the United States still adhere to- their 
arbitrary measures, and hence the difficulty of rearranging the orders sent to 
English and American merchants expressed in terms of the metric system. 
There are commercial schools of three kinds in Germany, Austria, and Switzer- 
land—(a) elementary, (b) secondary, and (c) higher. The elementary are found in 
connection with so-called ‘‘ continuation schools” in cities; they are evening and 
secular Sunday schools. The secondary are mostly day schools, and the higher 
institutions, of which there are only a few in Vienna, Leipsic, Berlin, Munich, 
Hamburg, Stuttgart, Frankfort, Zurich, Geneva, and Berne, are of world-wide 
repute and train commercial leaders. Germany alone had 247 secondary com- 
mercial schools in 1895, but less than 30 in 1871. 
Commercial schools in Germany have come into existence through the initiative 
of boards of trade in commercial centers, and were at first private schools. The 
communal government in many cases made them city schools, and the state gov- 
ernment granted them subsidies, as it did industrial and agricultural schools. 
They have no uniform course of study, nor do they form a system of schools under 
professional supervision. In this respect the governments follow the policy adopted 
with regard to industrial and agricultural schools, 
The German states are primarily concerned about schools that give elementary 
education; next, each state establishes and maintains secondary schools that lead 
up to the university; and, lastly, it provides for higher education in universities 
and polytechnica. These state institutions all aim at general culture, and form 
the state school system. Technical, trade, industrial, commercial, and agricul- 
tural schools of lower and advanced grade are special schools which are independ- 
ent of uniform regulations. Their establishment is left to the initiative of private 
citizens or the communities. When they show that they meet the local needs of the 
community and are likely to indirectly benefit the state, the latter is petitioned for 
a subsidy, which is rarely denied. This is the reason why we find a silk-weaving 
school in Crefeld and one in Saxony, and a braiders’ school in Berlin, where much 
cane furniture is manufactured. 
In general, the foregoing statements hold good for Austria proper, and for 
Switzerland; both countries follow the policy adopted by the various German 
states. 
The 20 so-called small German’states (Kleinstaaten) have a population of 5,761,- 
087, and they maintained 2,437 special schools (industrial, commercial, and agri- 
cultural) in 1896. This does not include any of the six larger German states, 
Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Wurtemberg, Baden, and Alsace-Lorraine, with a popu- 
lation of 46,485,502. Minute statistics concerning the special schools in these 
six states are not available at this writing. 
The 2,437 special schools (in states whose area and population taken together 
are like those of the State of Ohio) are classified as follows:

The map on the following page is that of Wiirtemberg, one of the twenty-six 
states of the German Empire. It shows the distribution of lower industrial 
schools, and distances and directions whence their pupils come. 
Some idea may be formed of the extent and importance of the efforts in behalf 
of industrial education in Germany when it is stated (by Professor Thurston, of 
Cornell University) that to educate our people as well as the people of the most 
favored parts of Europe, as Germany, we should have in this country: 
“Twenty technical universities, having in their schools of engineering and 
higher technics 50 instructors and 500 pupils each. 
“Fifty trade schools and colleges, of 20 instructors and 300 students each, 
“Two thousand technical high schools, or manual-training schools, of 10 
instructors and 200 pupils each. 
“That is to say, there should be in the United States to-day 1,000 university 
professors and instructors and 10,000 students under their tuifion studying the 
highest branches of technical work; there should be 1,000 college professors and 
15,000 pupils in technical schools studying for superior positions in the arts; and

20,000 teachers engaged in trade and manual-training schools, instructing pupils, 
400,000 in number, proposing to become skilled workmen. We have in this coun- 
try 10,000,000 families, among which are at least 1,000,000 boys who should be in

the latter class of schools. The cost of such education would be, per annum, 
about 50 cents per inhabitant additional to the present school tax, and in the shops 
of these schools less than $100 per student, and for total costs of higher education

under $300 per annum per student. Such is the work of which so small a part, at 
most, can be done by existing colleges, however great the desire of the authorities 
to carry out the intentions of the people. Such is the somewhat intimidating 
comparison, also, of the condition of our country and the more enterprising and 
wisely governed countries of Europe. The latter have had generations the start 
of us, and only the extraordinary natural advantages of our country and the 
more extraordinary general intelligence and enterprise of its citizens can possibly 
prevent this disadvantage under which we labor from telling fatally against us in 
the course of time, when the inevitable competition of the world shall affect us.” 
SUPPLEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN BERLIN. 
In the foregoing article the purely industrial schools (technical and trade 
schools) of Berlin are mentioned, and a statistical table of attendance and expend- 
itures is given. In that statement an item called “continuation schools” is 
worthy of further explanation. Continuation or supplementary schools in Berlin 
are evening schools, held in common-school buildings. They are not trade schools, 
but institutions for the further education of boys and girls who have passed 
through the common elementary school and desire to perfect themselves in one 
way or another, in order to rise in the social scale and prepare themselves for 
higher pursuits than common labor. Many of the students of these schools are 
ambitious and take up secondary-school studies, such as foreign languages, math- 
ematics, and drawing. Hence five secondary schools (so-called City Realschulen) 
have opened secondary evening schools, in which, besides the mother tongue and 
arithmetic, the following branches are taught: French, English, bookkeeping, 
highermathematics, drawing, chemistry,commercial science, and related branches. 
A small tuition fee is charged. Gratuitous instruction is offered to 10 per cent of 
the attendants if indigent. The cost of these secondary supplementary schools 
amounted to 88,587 marks ($9,185) in 1895-96. About 1,000 boys attended these 
schools in the winter of 1895-26, while in the summer preceding the number 
was 738, 
Much more extensive than these secondary schools, in both their influence and 
attendance, are the elementary supplementary schools. There are 12 for boys and 
13 for girls. In those for boys the studies are: Mother tongue (grammar and com- 
position), arithmetic, drawing, technical drawing, modeling, bookkeeping, geom- 
etry, physics and chemistry, French, English, history, civics, and shorthand. The 
sum total of expenditure for the boys’ and girls’ schools, borne entirely by the city 
government, amounted to 276,606 marks ($38,171). Notuition feeischarged. The 
girls’ schools are somewhat more bent upon practical pursuits, as is seen from the 
following list of studies: Mother tongue, arithmetic, drawing, bookkeeping, 
embroidery, machine sewing, cutting, ironing, millinery, shorthand, typewriting. 
French, English, singing, gymnastics. The number of pupils in these girls’ schools 
was 5,000 in 1895-96. All except the common branches are optional studies. 
In a governmental report on the Berlin trade and industrial, as well as supple- 
mentary, schools, published in Berlin in February, 1897, the entire number of 
students attending these schools is found to be 14,750, or about 1 per cent of the 
population. These students repesent 160 different trades or occupations. The 
joiners (837), locksmiths (1,420), machinists (1,189), machine builders (919), typo- 
graphers (563), and commercial students (2,549) are the most numerous. 
EDUCATION OF APPRENTICES IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 
Court Councilor Dr. William Exner and Dr. A. Vetter, of Vienna, recently 
undertook a journey through Germany and Switzerland in order to study the 
various modes in which the Governments of these countries encourage the practi-
-P-A-G-E-265
  
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 1223 
cal training of apprentices. The Government of Austria has been induced by the 
fierce struggle for existence, in which continental European nations are engaged 
in the field of industry, to promote skilled labor by extraordinary means, which 
we in the United States are accustomed to call ‘‘ paternal influence.” Hence this 
delegation was sent to neighboring states, which are known to be superior to 
Austria in some fields of industry. These gentlemen reported in the official organ 
of the Imperial Austrian Technological Museum in Vienna upon the results of 
their observations. The report contains so many instructive details that it aroused 
the attention of many who believe that industrial education is a problem worth 
considering at the present time. Numerous letters of inquiry received in this 
Bureau concerning the location of certain German industrial and trade schools 
and their courses of study make it obvious that an English version of the report 
of the two Austrian commissioners will interest many.citizens in the United States 
who are apprehensive of the ultimate result of the changed conditions of labor by 
the introduction of machinery. The following is the report of the two experts: 
Dr. P. Scheven said, in his book on Workshops for Apprentices, that it was a 
problem worthy of our attention how to prevent the training of apprentices by 
master workmen from falling into disuse after the liberty of trade (Gewerbefrei- 
heit) had been guaranteed by law. This problem has been approached first by 
three German States, to wit, Wiirtemberg, Hessia, and’ Baden. To some extent 
other German States followed their example, notably Prussia, Bavaria, and also 
most of the cantons (states) of Switzerland. But only Switzerland has carried 
out the proposed work of reform in all its details. 
It is no wonder that the public affairs of the state are increased by a task which 
affects the life of the broadest layers of society if we consider that one of the 
characteristic signs of the time is the rapid extension of the area of state’s duties, 
We now establish institutions with state aid for the solution of social problems, 
where formerly individuals attempted it with limited means. In the field of edu- 
cation the state began with universities and reached further and further down 
till at present the master workmen are released from training their apprentices, 
or, in cases where they still keep apprentices, the master workmen are made 
organs of the state, i. e., state teachers. 
It seems that in the States mentioned above the venerable, ancient institution 
of training in workshops by masters is reverently fostered, and three other means 
have proved to be practical and successful. Aside from industrial institutions of 
purely educational character (found in great number in Germany, Austria, and 
Switzerland!), we find voluntary, and at times obligatory, examinations for 
apprentices. Hand in hand with these examinations go exhibitions of apprentice 
work, test work performed for and during examinations. The government of the 
Grand Duchy of Baden went still further in its parental care and attempted to 
promote the professional knowledge of the masters themselves by paying them 
salaries and requiring them to follow a prescribed course of work in training their 
apprentices. 
The Austrian minister of commerce began in 1892 to promote the small trades 
(Kleingewerbe), influencing them by granting privileges and material aid, and 
they have in consequence developed in a most gratifying manner. On principle, 
the minister limited his influence to such tradesmen as were either masters or 
journeymen. His aid was partly given in a concrete way by granting motive 
power for machines and thus changing the drudgery of mechanical labor to 
machine work, lifting, as it were, the man who had hitherto done all his work by 
hand tota small manufacturer and widening his horizon of thought as well as his 
sphere of trade. But, not satisfied with this material aid, he offered the tradesmen 
opportunities for the extension of technical knowledge, giving them information 
  
1 See page 1215 of this annual report. 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
1224 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
concerning modern modes of production found in other countries. This enabled 
them to vie with foreigners. ' 
This information was offered by means of both printed documents and suitable 
evening and holiday trade schools. Having had such signal success in these 
attempts, the minister now entertains the idea of extending the work of his depart- 
ment by influencing the younger generation, the apprentices. Hence he sent the 
authors of this report, Profs. W. Exner and A. Vetter, to Germany and Switzer- 
land, during the summer of 1896, to investigate what is being done in these two 
countries toward promoting the practical training of apprentices. 
Examinations of apprentices and exhibitions of apprentices’ work are found to 
occur in organic connection in several States visited. In the past they were not 
always so connected. Some States began with examinations, like Wirtemberg, 
in which kingdom question books for locksmiths (prepared by Mr. Karmarsch, a 
skilled technologist) were in use as early as 1886. Hessia first began with exhibi- 
tions of apprentice work, the first of which dates back to 1848. At present, the 
apprentice examinations have developed to so high a degree of perfection in Switz- 
erland that the regulations existing there are considered models for imitation. 
The city of Basle made the beginning in 1877 with 17 candidates. From there the 
movement spread rapidly, so that in 1887 Switzerland had 27 cities (examination 
centers) with 1,536 candidates. 
These examinations, at first, lacked uniformity and organization, but in 1888 
the Swiss Industrial Society, which had been the instigator of the movement, took 
the matter in hand officially and established a normal course of requirements. 
Only such candidates as could furnish documentary evidence of having followed 
the course were admitted to the examinations. The Federal Government granted 
the society the sum of 2,500 francs to publish the course. This proved to be such 
an impetus to the annual examinations that the draft of a new industrial code of 
Zirich in 1895 declared the passing of an examination obligatory for every appren- 
tice in the canton, and made it a duty of the cantonal (State) government to 
supervise the examinations and bear the costs. Ziirich is the leading industrial 
center in eastern Switzerland. The western part of the Republic did not, at first, 
take readily to the idea of examining apprentices. Not until 1890 did the cantons 
of Freiburg and Neuenburg adopt the measure. Geneva and Vaud soon followed 
the example. Freiburg now (1896) stands at the head of the movement and has 
adopted the regulation of obligatory apprentice examination. In connection with 
an exhibition of apprentice work in Geneva (1896) astatistical table was published 
which showed that during the period from 1877 to 1896 as many as 9,178 appren- 
tices, representing 134 different trades, have been examined in Switzerland. 
On an average, about 1,200 candidates are now examined annually. This num- 
ber will, of course, greatly increase as soon as obligatory examination is adopted 
in every canton. The expenditures for these examinations amount to about 20 
francs ($4) per candidate. The federal and cantonal governments defray one- 
third, the industrial societies and trade unions and private citizens two-thirds of 
the cost. In addition to these local examinations, several trade unions arrange 
their own examinations to meet the requirements of their special professional 
needs. Thus, for instance, the Swiss printers have had their own examinations 
for apprentices which date back to the sixties, and it is stated that at least 90 per 
cent of all typographers in Switzerland entering upon membership after having 
completed their term of apprenticeship have been rigidly examined. Their num- 
ber is not included in the total number mentioned above. 
The organization of apprenticeexaminations is the work of the Swiss Industrial 
Society; this is a corporation which has had an extraordinary influence upon 
industrial education in Switzerland. Since the Federal Government pays it an 
annual subsidy, it attends to apprentice examinations as a duty demanded by the 
State. The far-reaching result of the second exhibition of apprentice work held in
-P-A-G-E-267

Geneva (the first was held in Berne in 1891) is the adoption of a radical reform in 
the mode of the examinations. The regulations contain the following essential 
points: 
The Swiss Industrial Society organizes a uniform system of examinations for 
Swiss apprentices. Being aided by the Federal and cantonal governments, it sup- 
ports all local authorities, societies, unions, and institutions which arrange such 
examinations and comply with the following requirements. 
The central office of the society appoints for the purpose of conducting uniform 
examinations a central board of seven members and determines their duties. The 
central board watches over the execution of the following rules, appoints expert 
examiners, takes part, as far as possible, in the examinations, and reports to the 
central office. It distributes the appropriations among the various examination 
centers, and is empowered to follow its discretion in giving special consideration 
and grants to such centers as excel in extending the movement and improving its 
methods. 
The results of examinations are published annually. A roster is kept of all 
apprentices who present themselves for examination. 
Rules.—All rules of separate examination centers must conform with the fol- 
lowing general rules: 
(1) To an examination may be admitted all apprentices, male or female, who 
can prove— 
(a) That their apprenticeship has lasted the number of years required for their 
vocation (prescribed by the central board in a special rule); 
(b) That they have spent at least five-sixths of their required time of appren- 
ticeship at the date of examination; 
(c) That they have attended regularly at least two half-yearly courses of an 
industrial continuation or technical school and studied the prescribed subjects. 
This requirement may be set aside in cases where the applicant can prove that 
such a school was inaccessible to him or her; but in this case an examination will 
have to determine whether the applicant has the required elementary knowledge. 
(d) Young journey men and women who have finished their apprenticeship in 
Switzerland may, within a year from that date, be examined also, provided they 
comply with the foregoing rules, but in such cases the examiners are enjoined to 
increase the requirements of examination. 
(2) The date of the annual examination shall be published at least three months 
in advance in local newspapers or by means of printed notices in shops and fac- 
tories and announcements in schools. The notice shall state the date and place 
for the reception of test work. Sufficient time should be given for the completion 
of this shopwork. 
The central board should be informed of date and place of examination, so that 
a delegation of the board may attend. 
(3) Applications for examination should be made on blanks furnished by the 
Swiss Industrial Society and be filled out in the handwriting of the apprentice. 
(4) Every candidate is required to pass the following examination: 
(a) A practical test in shopwork, consisting of a sample of manual work pre- 
scribed by the expert and done in his presence. The central board determines, 
upon motion of the experts, the limit of time within which his work must be 
finished. 
(b) The exhibition of a piece of work done by the apprentice without aid should 
be made where circumstances permit. This piece may be made in the master’s 
workshop. The experts, or their deputies, appointed by the board should visit the 
apprentice in the shop during the time in which he is engaged in making his piece. 
In cases where the making of such a piece is impossible or impracticable the 
working drawings may be substituted.

(c) In connection with the examination in shopwork an oral examination in the 
technique of the trade should take place, conducted by the expert. 
(d) The examination in school studies embraces the mother tongue, reading, 
and composition; arithmetic, mental, and written work in denominate numbers, 
whole numbers, and fractions; simple bookkeeping; drawing, free-hand and tech- 
nical, with reference to the trade in which the candidate is apprenticed. 
(e) Excellent school diplomas may release a candidate from oral examination, 
but only with reference to school studies, not with reference to technical branches. 
Apprentices who fail to give satisfaction to the foregoing requirements can not be 
granted apprentices’ diplomias (Lehrbriefe). 
(5) The oral examination in technical branches (see 4, a, b, and ¢) is to be con- 
ducted by two expert artisans and one member of the central board or his deputy. 
The examination in school studies, in cases where the absence of satisfactory school 
diplomas makes an examination necessary, is to be conducted by professional 
school-teachers. The local examining board supervises the examinations. Only 
the professional experts and the members of the local and central boards have 
admission to these examinations. 
(6) Every apprentice is to be supervised by the experts appointed to conduct the 
technical examination while the applicant makes a trial piece of his own choosing, 
and the master of his shop has to certify to his having worked without aid. The 
prescribed practical test in presence of the examiner is to take place at a neutral 
lace. 
e (7) The results of the examination are to be stated separately (a) for shop- 
work of the candidate’s own choosing as well as for prescribed tasks; (b) for tech- 
nical knowledge in oral examination; (c) for school studies. 
(8) The diplomas are not to be delivered to the successful candidate until he 
has finished the required number of years in the shop as apprentice. The master 
of the shop certifies as to that fact. The diploma must specifically state what 
trade the apprentice has learned, or whether only a special branch of a trade, or 
whether he has been examined for a specialty only, though having learned the 
whole trade. 
(9) Samples of apprentice work handed in by candidates for examination are to 
be left a few days on exhibition, labeled with the names of the makers, those of 
their masters, and the diploma rating. 
For Switzerland, it is obvious from the foregoing, the organization of examina- 
tions for apprentices is firmly settled for a period of years, though minor points 
may give rise to discussion and changes. Other States have adopted a different 
policy, owing to circumstances with which they had to reckon. In Baden, for 
instance, the test work (not only the shop work of the candidate’s own choosing) 
has to be announced several months in advance of the oral examination. Hessia, 
too, insists upon this peculiar feature. Whether the candidates should be 
granted only diplomas or also premiums is still a mooted question. Opinions 
and customs in different States differ also as to whether the apprentice’s own test 
piece is to be done in his master’s shop or in that of another, perhaps in the shop 
of the examining expert. In most cases the former locality is chosen. It is worth 
stating that indigent apprentices are furnished the necessary material free of 
charge. In Hessia and Bavaria it is the rule that this test piece is to be made ear- 
lier, not shortly before the oral examination; that is, within one or two years 
after the beginning of the apprentice term. In Baden the Government began to 
regulate apprentice examinations much later than other States, and even to-day 
local industrial societies are allowed to modify the regulations prescribed by the 
central authority to suit their convenience or local needs. 
In Switzerland the exhibitions of apprentice work are not an essential organ for 
promoting the education of apprentices. Such exhibitions are held at intervals of 
five and six years, but then they are arranged on a grand scale. This is done
-P-A-G-E-269
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 1227 
chiefly to give interested persons an opportunity to inform themselves concerning 
the status of apprentice training and the results of examinations. In Hessia and 
Bavaria, on the other hand, these exhibitions occur annually; the directors of the 
exhibition form permanent boards, which collect the pieces of work and attend 
to their tasteful exposition every year. 
In Hessia the ‘‘Landesgewerbeverein” and in Bavaria the union of Bavarian 
industrial societies have constituted themselves as central authorities, and are so 
acknowledged by the State, in matters pertaining to apprentice examinations. 
The Bavarian exhibitions are held annually in the industrial museum at Nurem- 
berg. The following principles, taken from the General Guide, show how exami- 
nations and exhibitions are organically connected there: 
(1) Examinations of apprentices and exhibitions of their test work are of great 
value for the practical training of thorough artisans, 
(2) The work of apprentices which is done on or about the date at which they 
conclude their term of apprenticeship will bear evidence as to the knowledge and 
skill they have acquired. Hence an exhibition of such work ismadea requirement 
of examination, 
(83) Premiums for such work are offered only to apprentices who complete their 
term of apprenticeship during the season in which the exhibition is held, but any 
apprentices may exhibit work done during the first and second year of their term 
of apprenticeship. 
(4) In order to judge the work properly, the applicant should bring documentary 
evidence of his having done the work without aid, and that he possesses the requi- 
site common-school education, as well as technical preparation; for the latter 
diplomas from industrial schools and working drawings made by the applicant 
are admissible. A testimonial concerning his conduct while engaged as appren- 
tice must accompany the application. 
The selection of the work made for examination and exhibition is left to the 
apprentice, but he is advised to select only such work as is in harmony with his 
regular shop work, does not require great expense, and does not offer extraordinary 
difficulties. Technical show pieces are to be avoided. A list of suitable pieces of 
work for a great number of trades is offered asa guide. This is what is done to 
promote the techical training of apprentices in Bavaria. 
Things are managed differently in Hessia. The local examination board here 
assigns a task, though, if the apprentice furnishes, besides this, a piece of his own 
choosing, it is accepted and exhibited. The Bavarian mode of procedure seems to 
aim at facilitating the selection, while the Hessian mode is intended to give the 
examiner an opportunity to judge the spontaneity of the apprentice. While the 
Bavarian list of tasks contains only work that may be expected of apprentices 
who have finished their term of apprenticeship, the Hessian list of tasks contains 
work which is designed to tell the examiner what he may expect after the first, 
second, third, and fourth year of the apprenticeship. In Hessia the following 
tasks are prescribed for machine builders and metal workers: 
Apprenticeship, first year.—Fit a bolt with a button into a round hole; diameter 
of bolt 20 mm., length 4 cm. \ Make a pair of screws with heads and nuts, a 
fashion piece with handle and crank, or a button on a box cover or on a newel 
post. File aruler 25 cm. long and 25mm. wide. Chisel a cast-iron piece, about 
120 mm. long, 60 mm. wide, 25 mm. thick, on three sides perfectly parallel and at 
right angles. Make a paper weight of pleasing form. Make a ring gauge 40 mm. 
wide, 100 mm. long with caliper thorn. Turn on the lathe a brace disk 125 mm, 
diameter, 50 mm. wide, 30 mm. bore-hole, arched. 
Apprenticeship, second year.—Fit and weld astay ring on a cylinder of about 30 
to 35 mm. thick. File an angle of given dimensions. File a ruler of given dimen- 
sions. Turn on the lathe a screw worm with flat thread, and nut. Cut intoa 
pieco of cylinder a nave with wedge teeth. Make a conic valve with three gauges 
   
-P-A-G-E-270
  1228 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
to fit into place; a two-armed cut clamp with borer and cheeks; a support guide; 
an inkstand with smooth hole; a joint or rectangular lever, a wall joint, an inter- 
mediate joint, or a funnel joint; a brake thread, one with the thread to the left 
and one to the right, with nuts. 
Apprenticeship, third year.—Make a sphere with tin case to fit it in; a ‘‘ Haar- 
schublehre;” a dovetail conduit with guide strips screwed on; a crosshead for 
graduating with one or two conduits; a conic valve with seat of 30 to 35 mm. 
diameter; a cube exactly measuring 40 mm., straight, parallel, and rectangular 
with caliper-ring; an elevator cylinder with stay rings and strap disks. 
In Bavaria similar tasks are prescribed, but fewertin number. While in Switz- 
erland a regular examination in common-school branches and test work is arranged, 
Bavaria provides for little more than an exhibition of work. Hessia pursues a 
middle course. The Bavarian method is, if not the most effective, the easiest to 
imitate. 
And now we turn to the third of the three methods mentioned in the beginning 
of this report—the promotion of professional or technical knowledge among the 
masters by subsidizing them for training apprentices. 
In 1884 the Mannheim trades union petitioned the Baden diet for an appropria- 
tion of 10,000 marks, to be expended in investigating the condition of the small 
trades, and reporting thereon with suggestions for their improvement. This sum 
was granted and expended in accordance with the petition. The proceedings of 
the commission having this matter in charge and the debate in the diet led to the 
adoption of a suggestion on the part of the Karlsruhe trades union. It was to the 
effect that master workmen who are willing to train apprentices systematically, 
according to certain regulations, should be supported by the state treasury. 
Hence, the minister of the interior of the Grand Duchy of Baden asked in 1888 
for 5,000 marks per annum for the purpose of subsidizing work masters and shop- 
owners who undertook the work of training apprentices. 
This measure was undertaken with the avowed intention to subject it to an 
honest trial. The success it hadis undeniable. Until the year 1895, an annual 
sum of 5,000 marks was appropriated; since then a larger subsidy has been 
granted. At the close of 1892, 23 trades, or 122 workshops, employing 180 appren- 
tices, were subsidized in Baden. At this time Switzerland took up the question. 
A circular letter was addressed to interested parties concerning the feasibility of 
adopting the plan followed in Baden, and the Industrial Society of Switzerland 
concluded in 1894 to appropriate 2,000 francs per year for three years in order 
that the plan be tested in a small way. The organization will be similar to that 
in vogue in Baden. If after three years (which will be in 1898) the plan of sub- 
sidizing master: workmen for training apprentices according to set rules and pre- 
scribed regulations has proved successful, it is confidently expected that the 
Federal Government will grant the means to carry out this plan on a grander 
scale. 
The discussion of this plan in Switzerland frequently touched upon the relation 
of educational institutions for the purpose of training in manual labor and the 
new apprentice shops. It was said that in industrial education the widest possi- 
ble freedom should be given; it should not be confined to any one kind. There is 
no country in Europe which can boast of more industrial schools and trade schools 
than Switzerland. A characteristic statement concerning an industrial institu- 
tion in the city of Berne may be quoted here to show how practical the Swiss peo- 
ple are and how wisely they try to meet the necessity arising from fierce industrial 
competition. 
It is characteristic of the trade school in Berne that it combines a large number 
of trades, so as to give its students not only all the bearings of his own trade, but 
also knowledge of its relation with others. The school is intended to be not only 
an industrial educational institution, but also a place where the students ean earn
-P-A-G-E-271
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 1229 
money in working at their trades, According to the regulations in force, the 
school has the aim (1) to enable young men to learn a trade; (2) to enable young 
men who have learned a trade in some workshop to complete their technical edu- 
cation practically and theoretically, so as to prepare themselves for higher posi- 
tions than that of laborers; (3) to check the immigration of skilled workmen from 
other countries and to elevate the Swiss laborers to a higher level of culture; (4) 
to elevate the trades in general. The means needed to carry on this extensive 
school are furnished by the community, partly also by the cantonal and the Fed- 
eral Government, and lastly through the sale of the products of labor in the shops. 
Instruction is entirely gratuitous. An exhibition of the students’ work is held 
annually, and the graduates of the institution are examined under the rules in 
force for apprentices (quoted in a foregoing paragraph). 
At present the institution has shops for shoemakers, joiners, carpenters, lock- 
smiths, braziers, and tinsmiths. For each of these trades a three-years course of 
instruction is prescribed. On admission to the institution the student enters upon 
a contract which is peculiar in some of its features. It is formed like the articles 
of apprenticeship, the two contracting parties being the authorities of the institu- 
tion on the one hand and the applicant on the other, The contract fixes the dura- 
tion of apprenticeship and the term of probation (four weeks), and enumerates the 
duties of the community, to wit, (a) the carrying out of the course of study, (b) 
gratuitous instruction, (¢) accident insurance of the student according to the pro- 
visions of the law, (d) assurance of remuneration for work performed over and 
above the prescribed tasks. This remuneration is regulated—0 to 75 per cent of 
itis paid monthly; the rest is deposited in the savings bank in the name of the 
student. Then follow the articles which state the duties of the student, and lastly 
provisions are made which enable either contracting party to sever their connection. 
Upon this basis an extensive institution is built up. In 1895 it required expendi- 
tures to the amount of 128,106 francs ($25,000), which were met by an income of. 
59,825 francs ($11,000) from communal, cantonal, and federal subsidies, and 
68,281 francs ($13,000) from the sale of the products of the shops. The number of 
students was 78 at the close of the year 1895. One of the greatest difficulties to 
be overcome was found in searching for a market for the shop products. Natu- 
rally the local owners of factories and workshops at first objected to the utiliza- 
tion of the students’ work, claiming that they entered into competition with 
legitimate labor. These objections were met with the following argument: The 
sum total of the school’s income from the sale of shop products, if divided by the 
number of factories and workshops of the trades represented in the school, showed. 
that only an insignificant share of the profit would fall upon each master in Berne, 
and the authorities appealed to their public spirit and asked them to sacrifice so 
small a sum toward the elevation of the trade rather than throw obstacles in the 
way of so laudable an institution. 
The city authorities met the claims of the tradesmen half way by limiting the 
number of applicants admitted into the school to 5 per cent of the number of the 
tradesmen doing business in Berne. This percentage has not yet been reached. 
‘The trades masters of late have abandoned their opposition to the trade school, 
and most of them are now staunch friends of the institution, which has recently 
opened a course for the further advancement of master workmen. The school has 
opened a few sales depots for its products in the city, enters into competition for 
public works, and manages its industrial features entirely like a well-managed 
factory. At first the principal was a master shoemaker of pronounced executive 
skill; lately a manufacturer and merchant stands at its head. 
We must deny ourselves the pleasure of quoting other examples of successful 
Swiss trade schools and industrial institutions for educational purposes for which 
Switzerland is noted. There are technical schools, masters’ courses for typogra- 
phers, ambulatory schools, traveling lecturers, patronage of apprentice work, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  1230 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
various other appliances for the popularizing of advanced industrial education. 
The Swiss nation exhibits a remarkably deep interest in everything that is apt 
to be for the public good. This is attributable to its purely democratic kind of 
government, which induces the citizen to participate in all public enterprises. The 
comparatively small yet compactly populated districts into which the cantons (or 
States) are divided facilitate the establishment of educational institutions which 
are impossible in sparsely settled countries. 
To return to the question as to which of the two methods is preferable (trade 
schools or the old-time apprenticeship in workshops under specified supervision of 
masters), it should be stated that the institution in Berne, sketched in the forego- 
ing paragraphs, approaches nearer the technical preparation in workshops than any 
other trade school. Generally, it may be admitted, trade schools, with scholars’ 
shop attached, are better in large cities representing trades of far-reaching special- 
ization, and difficult trades that need an unusual amount of theoretical education 
and special preparation, i. e., better than the old-time apprenticeship. On the 
other hand, it can be stated with confidence that the system of apprenticeship in 
small workshops is preferable in simple trades and small towns, because that sys- 
tem offers opportunities to see all the bearings of the trade to be learned. If the 
workshop is well equipped; if the master takes a hand in the work, and watches 
the conduct of the apprentice; if thelatter is permitted to take up all branches of the 
work and not only repairing and patching; if the master supervises the drawing, 
modeling, and bookkeeping of the apprentice; if to all this comes the ethical 
momentum of an insight into a flourishing enterprise which hourly shows how 
diligence, knowledge, skill, and honesty change into material value, the system of 
apprenticeship will offer great advantages. But rarely are all these conditions 
found together. Thoroughly equipped and willing masters are rare; rare are also 
apprentices who have the capacity to rise above the average workman. We gen- 
erally find that boys of small or no means at all are ‘‘put out as apprentices.” 
Hence the desirability of regulating the training of apprentices by influencing the 
masters, and offering them a remuneration for the trouble this training causes 
them. 
As stated before, the management of the system of paying for results is an 
imitation of that adopted in Baden. The central office of the Swiss Industrial 
Society resolved, September 8, 1894, as follows: 
“Workshop masters of various trades who enter into an agreement to comply 
with the rules for training apprentices may be granted a subsidy of 250 francs 
for each apprentice. The selection of the masters is made by the central office of 
the Industrial Society. Masters whose former apprentices have passed the exam- 
ination with credit are preferred. It isa matter of importance that the masters 
who apply for a subsidy give board and lodging to their apprentices,” 
The following is a copy of the regulations issued: 
(1) A written contract between master and apprentice is entered into, which 
contract must be in harmony with the normal contract designed by the Swiss 
Industrial Society. It must contain the following provisions: 
(a) The term of apprenticeship begins with a probationary term of from four 
to eight weeks, which is to be included in the whole term of the contract. 
(b) The term of apprenticeship is not to exceed the normal minimum prescribed 
by the aforementioned society for the respective trade. 
(c) The master is required, in case the apprenticesdoes not live with his parents 
in the neighborhood, to give him board and lodging and supervise his conduct 
during and after work hours. Exceptions to this duty are admitted in cases where 
the master has placed the apprentice in a family in which he is well taken care of. 
(d) If the apprentice should fall ill, the master is required to see to it that he is 
properly nursed and that medical aid be called in. If the sickness lasts longer 
than four weeks, the master must, if desirable, have the patient sent to a hospital. 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 1231 
(e) The normal contract prescribed by the Swiss Industrial Society contains a 
number of paragraphs referring to the mode of teaching the trade, which must 
be conscientiously followed. Work must not be required of the apprentice after 
the legal work hours, or on Sundays, except in rare cases of emergency. 
(2) Every contract entered into, if based upon the requirements prescribed by 
the society, must be submitted to the central office, where it is to be deposited in 
duplicate. 
(3) Every apprentice of a subsidized workshop is required to present himself 
for examination at the close of his term, and the master workman is obliged to 
grant the apprentice sufficient time and materials to make his test piece. 
(4) An apprentice, under the rules of the society, must have completed his four- 
teenth year and possess the necessary intellectual and physical qualities. In 
doubtful cases the society may arrange an examination for admission. 
(5) The subsidy mentioned is determined by local and professional circum- 
stances, and is paid in two equal installments, one at the close of half the term of 
apprenticeship and the other at the close of the term, after the master has given 
evidence of having fulfilled all the duties required of him. 
(6) The subsidy guaranteed to a master is not transferable to his heirs or 
assigns in case of death or closing of his shop, unless the central office specially 
orders the payment. 
(7) If the contract between master and apprentice becomes void before it expires, 
the officers of the industrial society determine the quota of subsidy due the master, 
or the amount of indemnity to which he may be entitled. 
(8) Failure on the part of the master to follow the rules prescribed by the society 
presupposes his waiving any subsidy whatsoever. 
(9) In cases of contention between master and apprentice with reference to the 
application of any point of the contract, the officers'of the society may be called 
upon for a decision, which decision is final. 
(10) For the purpose of supervising the proper performance of the master’s 
duties to his apprentices, and for the purpose of constantly being informed as to 
the status of the education of the apprentices for whom subsidies are paid, a num- - 
ber of local trustees are appointed, who report to the central office at stated inter- 
vals. These trustees may be charged with special duties, such as inspection, 
special examinations, and judicial duties in cases of contention. 
This is the modus operandi adopted in Switzerland. At present the institution 
is too young to record results; still the officers of the society are convinced that it 
will be fully as satisfactory in its workings as the one in the Grand Duchy of 
Baden. Furthermore, in Switzerland, as well as in Baden, the conviction seems 
to make progress that it is better for the trades and general industrial prosperity 
to subsidize the masters for the training of apprentices than to extend the system 
of trade schools hitherto favored by the Government.

CHAPTER XXVI. 
RECENT EFFORTS IN EUROPE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT 
AND IMPROVEMENT OF AGRICULTURE.’ 
I.—CaPITALISTIO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. 
It seems strange that agriculture, which has been regarded as the most inde- 
pendent vocation in the world, should be dependent upon the more or less fortui- 
tous aid of capital. But those who speak of the independent position of the 
farmer are inclined to emphasize his position as a self-sufficing one in which he, 
like Robinson Crusoe, may satisfy his wants through his own labor. However 
true this conception of farming may have been before the temptations offered by 
traveling agents and newspaper advertisements of enterprising manufacturers 
magnified the wants and the expenditures of the farmer, it is not true to-day 
except in the districts which are contented to live ‘‘ behind the times.” Since self- 
sufficing agriculture, then, does not require a working capital other than is pro- 
vided by the natural increase of the family (for even the political economy of 
Robinson Crusoe admitted the advantage of a man Friday), it is evident that in 
the following pages the discourse can be only concerned with agriculture.as an 
industry or, as it is called, capitalistic production. 
The proposition of the political economists that industry is limited by capital 
is applicable to agriculture which, asfar asit is concerned with producing a ‘‘money 
crop,” is thus limited or hampered, like any other industry, by the lack of capital. 
Let this crop be what it may, wheat in the Northwest, cotton in the South, tobacco 
or corn in the intervening section, cattle raising in the region beyond the Missouri 
and the Red River of the South, or market gardening and truck farming in the 
populous East, each ‘‘money crop” requires capital, each exploiter of the soil, like 
each commission or other city merchant, requires the presence of a fund upon 
which he may draw in time of need for the purpose of promoting an enterprise or 
tiding over a failure. But as the city merchant is constantly receiving into his 
possession moneys which are not, properly speaking, his (the cities being clearing 
houses), ‘‘accommodation money” is very much easier for him to obtain than for 
the isolated farmer. 
“The element of credit,’’says the French economist, M. Leon Say, ‘‘is the money 
of others, but its principle is either to get money to spend upon oneself or to invest 
in business. Money obtained for the first purpose is generally supposed to be a 
ruinous operation, while money obtained for the second is advantageous only as the 
business ability of the borrower is good and the amount he pays for the hire of the 
money (usually called ‘interest’) is reasonable.” Now, attribute it to what you 
please, this rule holds that people are much more apt to lend to those who are of 
the same business class as themselves than to those who have neither the appearance 
of wealth nor the manners of the class to which the lender belongs. ‘‘in Ger- 
many,” says Gustav Schénberg, ‘those who suffer the most from want of credit

are the proprietors of medium-sized or small farms, especially the peasant. The 
large proprietors sometimes can not get a sufficient credit, but nevertheless they 
are better able to procure cash for current needs, either from the money passing 
through their hands as gross returns from the cultivation of their estates or by 
writing to their bankers or to an establishment of credit. But when the small. 
farmer, with very little experience in monetary matters and an unknown financial 
status, has need of credit, he falls into the hands of those whose business it is to 
‘exploit his poverty and inexperience.” 
| Itis therefore asked by some if it is wise to enlarge the opportunity of the small 
proprietor to borrow. ‘It would be disastrous if land owners were to run into 
‘debt to improve their land,” says Rodbertus! and others. To these objections 
‘Signor Leone Wollemborg, an expert in such matters, answers in this fashion: 
\‘‘Is it useful to create a loaning fund for the agriculturist? Some agricultural 
‘societies and some representative agriculturists assert that it is dangerous to 
do so, for the peasant is consumed with such a fever to acquire land that he 
‘contracts obligations which eventually bankrupt him. Credit is therefore a dan- 
gerous as well as a precious ally, and it is necessary to use it rationally.” From 
Signor Wollemborg’s admission in his defense of agricultural credit it follows 
that capital borrowed by the farmer, though beneficial when used in judicious 
exploitation of the farm, is a dangerous expedient to resort to in order to acquire it. 
Other considerations are not wanting to illustrate, if not to explain, the inade- 
quacy of capital in coined money at the disposal of the farmer. One of these, 
though of a theoretical or speculative nature, may be stated in concluding the 
foregoing remarks upon farming as capitalistic production. 
The true value of property of all kinds in the United States in 1890 is placed by 
the census at $65,037,091,197, yet the amount of money in circulation at that date 
was $1,429,251,270. In brief, had it been possible to put up all the property in the 
United States at auction on June 30, 1890, one of two things would have happened, 
either there would not haye been cash enough in the country to buy it in at its 
“true valuation,” or its ‘‘true value” would have shrunken until it became only 
one forty-sixth of what it was the day before; or, to say the same thing over, in 
such a market every one dollar of “true valuation” would have become two cents. 
In England and France the same conditions prevail. Now, in 1892 the United 
States exported an unprecedentedly large amount of her products which are prin- 
cipally obtained from nature. These exports amounted to nearly $800,000,000, and 
if paid for by the exporters before shipment abroad must have sent perhaps half 
the money in circulation into the agricultural States. 
It is of course impossible to say that there is an instructive conservation of 
exchange forces similar to the mechanical equating in physics known as the con- 
servation of energy, but it seems evident that the farmer who is placed between 
nature and the middleman is not nearly so favored as a possessor of circulating coin 
as is the business man who is the intermediary between the farmer and another 
business man.. The returns of the farmer are the residuum of the final price    
   
                     
   
                     
     
    
    
    
        
    
      
1Zur Erklarung und Abhiilfe der heutigen Creditnoth des Grundbesitzes, page 138. Prof. 
Thorold Rogers remarks: ‘‘ Nor were these yeomen (freeholders of his native village in Hamp- 
shire, England), unprosperous when they were active, temperate, and thrifty. The greatest} 
peril they ran was in purchasing land with their savings, mortgaging it to obtain possession, 
and, up to this having committed no serious error, cultivating the land with insufficient capital. 
Ihave known several yeomen who, having fallen into this mistake, have lived a life of extreme] 
labor and thrift, and, haying enlarged their estate, were poorer at their death than they were| 
when they began their career. And in this day I believe that agricultural distress is, and has 
been for some years past, due to the double cause of enlarged domestic expenditure and insuffi 
cient capital for the extent of land occupied.” (Six Centuries of Work and Wages, p. 56.) Bu 
compare his dictum, page 62, that population keeps pace with the amount of customary food of 
the people, and wages never fall below the amount necessary for the laborer and his family t

   obtained for his wares after others have deducted the price of handling and con- 
verting them, and are profitable or not relatively to the price at which he hired 
money a year before he harvested his crop. Or, to use the illustration once 
employed by a political economist to explain the wage-portion or wage-fund theory, 
the matter is simply a question of division; the volume of money in circulation, 
the dividend, is stable, while the crude products vary; thus the coin values, the 
quotient, received in return by the farmer fluctuates inversely with the volume 
of the productions arising from the labor of the class to which he belongs and the 
favorableness of the season. The difficulties encountered by political economy in 
defining the word ‘‘ value” are as perplexing as those met by political philosophy 
in defining the word ‘‘equality ” or ‘‘liberty.”? 
II.—MEANING AND USE OF THE TERM ‘AGRICULTURAL CREDIT.” 
In regard to the acquisition of the soil he cultivates, the American farmer has 
‘been favored beyond the farmers of any other nation or of any other time. In 
Rome the division of the public lands was accompanied by the riotous epoch of 
the Gracchi. In Great Britain one-fourth of the arable public lands were 
“inclosed” during the last two hundred years, and became the property of indi- 
vidual landlords.* In France the revolutionary Assembly of 1789 confiscated the 
immense land possessions of the Catholic Church* and sold them, in lots of 2 or 3 
lacres, for a nominal sum to the peasants who had for so many years cultivated 
  
1It is possible that an objection may be raised to the foregoing matter asin reality advocating 
loverproduction. It is said by Mr. Giffen, the eminent English statistician, that countries whose 
roductions are merely of an agricultural or mining nature indubitably feel the consequences of 
ia depression in trade much more severely than manufacturing communities. The firstreason he 
gives for this dictum is ‘the greater liability of raw material being occasionally produced in 
xcess of the demand for it ” by the manufacturing community, which can more quickly propor- 
‘ion its output to the public wants. Assuming that Mr. Giffen’s first reason is true, it would 
‘ollow that a plenitude of capital put at the disposal of the agricultural class, as discussed in 
his chapter, would stimulate an overproduction of raw material and a lessening of the price 
ybtained for it by the farmer. Nevertheless, it is difficult to see why equally injurious results 
ould not follow if capital in large quantities were to be placed at the disposal of the manufac- 
uring class unless protected by the trades unions we call trusts. It seems that as long as raw 
oducts, especially food stuffs, are salable in and transportable to the markets of the world 
here need always be less apprehension of overproduction in agriculture than in manufactures, 
least in stable economic conditions, such as where the application of machinery to the transfor- 
ation of raw material into artificial forms of convenience or luxury has not overdirected capi- 
al to manufacturing by the offer of high interest or a patent-right system has not stimulated 
the production of machinery itself, or overconstruction of transporting agencies should over- 
stimulate agricultural production, or vice versa. When the economic conditions are lopsided 
1 when prices are being lowered in a lopsided way, that form of production—agricultural or 
anufacturing, as the case may be—will attract the most people which has the most capital at 
ts disposal, and it is the people who feel the hard times, for to them that term means not depri- 
ation of the pleasures, but frequently the want of the necessities of life. In 1883 a report of a 
oyal (British) commission on the depression of that date characterized the situation in the 
ropositions: 
(1) Avery serious falling off in the exchangeable value of the produce of the soil; 
(2) Anincreased production of nearly all other classes of commodities; 
(8) A tendency in the supply of commodities to outrun the demand; 
(4) A consequent diminution in the profit obtainable by production; and 
(5) A similar diminution in the rate of interest on invested capital. 
A series of changes of this description, if universally and not merely theoretically true, would 
inevitably result in an entirely new basis of finances; a sort of mild economic revolution only 
ecognizable when the future shall have given the necessary “ historical perspective.” 
2The effects of this are thus described by the Right Hon. G. Shaw Lefevre, M. P.: ‘The 
ight of turning out cattle on the waste and other rights overSthe commons were highly favor- 
ble to the existence of small ownerships, and when disconnected from these rights the small 
larms and small freeholds became economically impossible to maintain.” Of course it will be 
inderstood that the’ inclosed wild land was put under culture by capital, and leased to small 
larmers, and also that those farmers who owned land were forced to sell, their property being 
soon swallowed up by their neighbors.” (Nineteenth Century, October, 1885, 517-518.)

them for their ecclesiastical lords. But in America none of these disagreeable 
features appear; for the Federal Government by its preemption laws, dating from 
1801, has given the land away at the mere cost of surveying it, and by the home- 
stead law of 1862 allowed it to be acquired for nothing. Thus Congress, up to 1880, 
had practically endowed agriculture with 268,150,000 acres, which, at the price 
fixed by the act admitting the new States beyond the Red River of the North, 
would have produced, if sold, $2,681,000,000—14 times the amount of the present 
national debt. The arable public lands in the United States are now exhausted, 
and our agriculture is coming under the conditions that prevail in Europe, both 
in the tenant-farming agricultural community of England and in the small- 
proprietor farming community of France. In Europe instruction in agricultural] 
processes and theory has not been found to be a panacea for the competition set} 
up by the fresh and cheap lands of America, and experimental fields are possibly} 
more calculated to enrich science than the farmer. The most experienced an 
thoughtful people on the continent, therefore, have for some years been givin, 
their attention to other methods to relieve the ‘‘ agricultural crisis” of the decad 
last past. In the following matter an account is given of the most prominent o: 
these methods, which, if it have no other effect, will be a school of economics fo: 
the farmer which will inevitably remove one disagreeable feature caused by hi: 
isolation, to wit, his ignorance of bookkeeping and the course of exchange—tw 
capital accomplishments in an age which appeals so strongly to everyone to mak 
money, and to combine with others to effect that object. 
The expression ‘‘ agricultural credit” has a definite meaning. It does not mea: 
the ability of the farmer to borrow money for any purpose whatever, but a fun 
upon which he can draw in order to procure stock, necessary implements, an 
fertilizing material. It is not intended for the tenant farmers of England, no 
the metayer (farmer on shares) of France, but is especially intended to aid an 
perpetuate a class of farmers which from the time of the Roman Republic ever: 
experienced government has striven to protect from the inroads which its ow 
necessities and improvidence have ever made upon it—that is to say, the class o! 
farmers called in France ‘‘ small proprietors,” as distinguished from the great pro 
prietors, known in England as “landlords,” who are people who manage thei 
estates through an agent, as a manufacturing company manages its busines 
through a superintendent, or, to magnify the matter greatly, as European goy| 
ernments managed their possessions in America, by viceroys, and ancient Rom 
her colonies by proconsuls. This is the fundamental principle, it is thought, o| 
the Raiffeisen system of agricultural credit for small proprietors, the avowe 
basis of which is cooperative local financial self-government. 
IlI.—THE MECHANISM OF AGRICULTURAL CREDIT,! 
It is a fact in Europe that banks which accept and discount the notes of 
mechanic or small merchant known to be honest refuse to do the same with th 
paper of a farmer. In France it has been proposed to pass a law requiring Stat! 
banks to accept the paper of agriculturists. Yet this aversion to agricultur: 
paper is not the result of ill will, but of business instinct or necessity. In the fir: 
place, the small proprietor is unknown to the banker, while the small mercha; 
Jives near him in the saine little city or town, and it is upon this very confidenc 
resulting from comparatively intimate relations, that credit is founded. In tl 
second place, there is a still more material obstacle to lending to a farmer. Sw

lished in La Science Sociale as a review of the work entitled Le Crédit Agricole en France 
a létranger, by Louis Durand, doctor in law and advocate before the court of appeals of Lyon; 
France. M. Rousiers, author of the well-known work on American Life, acknowledges hi 
indebtedness to the ‘judicial work” of M. Durand, and the same acknowledgment is ma 
by the writer of this chapter.

pose the banker is willing to advance money to.a small proprietor in whom he 
has confidence, then another difficulty presents itself. It is the custom-of the 
French banks not to lend money for more than three months. In three months 
the man of commerce has sold his merchandise, been paid for it, and pays his own 
debt with the proceeds. Three months will not, generally speaking, permit the 
farmer to accomplish these matters. If the farmer can not obtain a credit for a 
- longer period than three months, it is better not to borrow at all. Some forms of 
market gardening, or other form of agriculture, which closely resembles the spe- 
cialized work of the mechanical trades, have found favor with existing institu- 
tions of credit when organized, as the ‘“‘Chamber of the Mouths of the Niévre” or 
“The Vegetable Growers of the Valley of Auge.” But the operations of these two 
bodies are confined to the buying of stock in the spring and the sale thereof in 
autumn, which allows a short term of credit, and the transactions are wholly done 
in cash. But these operations are conducted by men of far greater standing than 
the ordinary peasant. 
To constitute an agriculture credit it is necessary to overcome two obstacles, 
which are: (1) To connect the small proprietor with the banker by a third person 
known to both; (2) to create a reserve fund which will permit the third person 
to give the small farmer a longer credit than the banker will grant, so that the 
small proprietor may indirectly profit by the credit offered by the bank. 
The whole question is contained in these two propositions. It would be per- 
fectly useless to force the national banks to accept ‘‘agricultural paper,” for if 
such paper were presented under the same conditions as commercial paper it would 
be willingly discounted. Equally useless would it be to establish in France a new 
bank especially for the purpose, since the Bank of France, La Société Général, Le 
Credit Lyonnais, etc., would be enchanted to trust their money to agriculture if 
they could be assured of the prompt repayment of the loan, and the special bank 
must have that assurance if it would avoid bankruptcy. 
These two ideas, then, are fundamental: First, there is a difference which sep- 
arates agricultural operations from commercial operations, the farmer from the 
merchant asa business man; second, it is illusory to make agricultural credit a 
sort of subsidy granted by the State to encourage agriculture. Agriculture, as 
any other industry, has no need of alms. What is required is a servant that can 
be used and paid. Such a servant has been named by a member of the French 
Assembly ‘‘ family banks;” that is to say, banks which are simply mutual asso- 
ciations, each of which fortifies the credit of its members by pooling the credit of 
all, But how, it is asked, can an association of small farmers who have no cash 
become a bank. Where will such a bank get its money? The answer is this: 
Banks which have money will willingly listen toa joint and several association 
of proprietors who guarantee the engagements of its members individually. Such 
a mechanism.is already in existence. In Germany they are called Darlehenskassen 
(lending banks), and are now introduced into Austria and, thanks to the propa- 
ganda of Sig. Wollemborg, into Italy. 
The Darlehenskassen of Herr Raiffeisen, or Raiffeisen’s loan banks for farmers, 
answer exactly to the needs of agricultural credit, and are founded upon keen 
observation of the social life in the country. Every borrower from a bank must 
1There were in Austria during 1895 994 Raiffeisen societies, with 60,000 members (estimated), 
and in Wiirtemberg there were 1,223 such societies, with perhaps 100,000 members. In Bavaria 
the Raiffeisen societies had grown in 1893 to 713 from 245 in 1885, with a membership of 62,000 as 
against 24,400 in 1885. The Swiss Government offered a bonus for each Raiffeisen society formed, 
but the Swiss enjoy such exceptionally good opportunities for obtaining money that the socie- 
ties do not multiply fast. In 1894 the Belgium Legislature passed an act favoring the creation of 
the Raiffeisen societies. The number of such societies in Germany in 1804 was 1,038; in Italy in 
1890 250 societies, with a membership of 15,000. In 1895 France had 281 of these societies.—Michael

agriculture and industries for Ireland, second edition.

be a member of the association, being admitted thereto by vote of the mem- 
bers. Ht is not necessary to be wealthy to obtain the loan, which is granted after 
admittance. = 
The borrower is expected to be industrious and economical, and must have 
impressed his neighbors that he is both these things. ‘‘ There are one hundred of us 
mutually standing guard over each one, so that there is no possibility but each mem- 
ber will be made acquainted with his duty,” said an Italian peasant to Signor Wol- 
lemborg. To anyone acquainted with life in the country, such a guaranty appears 
sufficient. Whatelse have peasants in the long winter evenings, at home, at church, 
on Sunday, at the fairs, marriage ceremonies, and other entertainments, to talk 
about if not the affairs of their neighbors, and nine times out of ten it is the finan- 
cial condition of their acquaintances which is the matter discussed. Such a one 
has scored a success, he has secured so much wheat, or feeds his animals in this 
or that way, or has a wife who is a poor manager; and before the subject is 
dropped a balance sheet is struck as to the man’s possessions, his energy, and his 
administrative ability. A bank having capital to lend can depend upon the judg- 
ment of a society of this kind, if it can be held jointly and severally responsible to 
the bank for its decisions. In this manner is the first obstacle to an agricultural 
credit overcome; for all the members of a community have gone bail for the honor, 
industry, and rational expectations of one of its members. 
In order that this surveillance may be effectual, the financial society can not 
embrace more than the limits of a single parish, for it is not enough to know that 
a man is industrious and economical; it is alsonecessary to know what he is going 
to do with the money borrowed and to witness the application of it to that purpose, 
for if the loan is not applied to the purpose for which it was granted, the associa- 
tion exacts its immediate restoration. Under this system it has been very rare 
for the Raiffeisen loan banks to come upon the mutual responsibility of its mem- 
bers, the reserve funds having been sufficient to repair the losses that have followed 
an unsuccessful loan. 
The Raiffeisen loan banks solve the second difficulty by confining themselves 
strictly to the work of an intermediary, by avoiding all speculation, all induce- 
ments of profit sharing, so as to in no way jeopardize the security they offer nor 
to infringe upon a wise caution. They have a reserve fund, but even this is not 
distributable on dissolution, but is deposited in the Imperial. Bank! (Reichs Bank) 
until a new association is founded in the same village so that the system is guar- 
anteed against the danger of a too great prosperity and the desire of some persons 
to profit by that prosperity by demanding a dissolution. The reserve fund is the 
profits arising from the operations; there is no entrance fee to be absorbed into 
the possession of the bank, though a sum (generally $2.50, the minimum required 
by law, and only exacted because required by law) is paid by the new member on 
entrance, which is his own property, however, and never goes into the reservefund. 
The constant and consistent effort of the agricultural credit association system 
of Raiffeisen is to keep each association as the loaning body politic of the parish, 
and to keep it out of the power of the feverish impulsation of the times to make 
money under all circumstances, which results, in joint stock concerns, in giving 
great opportunities to enterprising managers, frequent ‘‘ mismanagement,” and. 
occasional defalcation. It must ever be remembered that the associations or 
so-called ‘‘ banks” for agricultural credit are intended to aid the small farmer, and 
  
1 Raiffeisen established a central bank as the general clearing house of his system. In remark- 
ing the union of “the psychology of the crowd” with business principles the imagination is 
warmed by the completeness of Raiffeisen’s work. He has created a special banking system which 
isnow dependent on capital, but which is a politico-financial body only equaled in its solidarity 
by the State. The labor unions of England and America are not to be compared to it, either in 
view of self-help or independence of purpose. There were in Germany in 1890 about 2,000 socie- 
ties for agricultural credit, with 20,000,000 francs in loans.

not to exploit his necessities and crude conceptions of financial operations. The 
reserve fund only becomes important in amount after some years. In the begin- 
ning there is none. But this does not prevent capitalists from lending money 
through the association. Ten associations selected at random show that the patri- 
mony of the members is twenty-eight times greater than the debts held against 
them. 
“Under such conditions credit will never be wanting. Even in times of crisis, 
when money is being withdrawn from banks, industrial and commercial enter- 
prises, capitalists are only too glad to be able to prefer the agricultural credit to 
that of State bonds. During the wars of Prussia with Austria (1866) and with 
France (1870) capitalists offered their money to the Raiffeisen banks without inter- 
est; for even admitting that an enemy should overrun the country, carry off the 
stock, and burn the buildings, the soil remains [and the owners], and that would 
only fall to half its value. What other investment is able to be compared, as far 
as security goes, with the security offered and guaranteed by the Raiffeisen asso- 
ciations? The result is that just as fast as these institutions become known they 
have more than enough capital placed at their disposal.”! Some owners of large 
estates (noblemen or capitalists) desire out of good will to aid these associations 
for procuring agricultural credit and become members, and as such put their 
large landed property under the same joint and several responsibility as that of 
the peasantry with whom they have joined themselves, voting upon questions of 
according and refusing credit as any other member. 
IV.—TuHeE ATTAcK oF SCHULTZE DELITZSCH, THE FOUNDER OF THE CLASS OF 
InsviTUTIONS KNOWN IN AMERICA AS BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS, ON 
RAIFFEISEN, THE FOUNDER OF THE ASSOCIATIONS TO PROCURE AGRICULTURE 
CREDIT. 
The Darlehenskasse, or Raiffeisen lending bank, to create an agricultural credit, 
is the application of the idea of the Vorschussyerein (association for advancing 
money) toagriculture, just as the building and Joan association of the United States 
‘is the application of the same idea to the purchase of property, ostensibly as homes 
for mechanics and other wage earners in cities. The first Vorschussverein was 
established in 1850 on the idea of Schultze Delitzsch. This gentleman had been 
struck with the fact that the possession of a sum of money, frequently a very small 
sum, might, in the hands of a mechanic or small merchant, produce very satisfac- 
ory results, and in many cases might procure for the industrious and saving 
laboring man who had a little laid by the means to advance his position. But the 
ssential condition to effect this good must be that the borrower must be indus- 
rious and saving. The same results might ensue from public or private gifts, 
ut the educative effect in that case would be nil. It is a general law, based 
pon human nature, that the price of a thing fixes its value, and that in conse- 
uence charity never produces the moral virtues of energy and economy, which 
lone are capable of permanently ameliorating the social condition of a man. 
ence the necessity of credit for the poor in purse, and also the necessity of pro- 
uring this credit not by the intervention of charity, but by the personal exertion 
f the party to be benefited, or, to put the matter squarely, to be educated. This 
is the problem that Schultze Delitzsch solved. The Vorschussverein makes its 
embers jointly and severally (creates a solidarity, to use a word not frequently 
mployed in English) responsible for the money advanced them by capitalists, and 
so creates a capital of its own to guarantee its debts and pay running expenses 
nd make profits to be distributed among the members as dividends. But Schultze

Delitzsch did not like the plan of Raiffeisen. In the year 1873 and again in 1876 
he attacked the Raiffeisen system on the floor of the Imperial Parliament of Ger- 
many, of which he was then a member, and in 1875, in a brochure, he put in print 
these charges: 
(1) The Darlehenskassen have not a business or reservefund (Geschiftsantheil) 
[or, as we say, ‘‘stock shares,” i. e., the regular payment of a small sum at 
monthly or other intervals]. Yet these payments are indispensable for the secur- 
ity of the association. 
(2) The Darlehenskassen lend the capital they receive for longer periods than it 
is borrowed for, which invites bankruptcy. 
(8) The reserve fund, which is constantly growing larger, is never distributed, 
which is an anomaly. 
(4) Associations which do not hold out hopes of profit are running counter to 
the aspirations of human nature and will not encourage saving, and can have no 
independent existence (auf eigenen Fiissen zu stehen). 
These points have been answered in detail and so effectually by M. Durand! 
that his defense is probably the best exposition of the Raiffeisen system extant. 
To the first charge made by Herr Schultze Delitzsch, M. Durand replies: 
‘There is no necessity for a reserve fund in the Raiffeisen system of agricultural 
credit, for the system is operated by and among a body of small proprietors who 
have land and instruments of tillage. The possessions of the members of the 
association on the plan of Schultze Delitzsch are by no means sufficiently large to 
reassure capital, and the accumulations of the Geschiftsantheil are a necessity for 
it. Again, if it is absolutely essential to have a Geschiftsantheil, the Raiffeisen 
system has a small but constantly growing one, which is held perpetually, while 
the Schultze Delitzsch scheme permits any member to withdraw with his 
‘ Geschiiftsantheil.’” 
To the second charge against the Raiffeisen system, M. Durand replies by deny- 
ing the validity of Herr Schultze Delitzsch’s contention. What bank is there that 
does not accept deposits payable at sight? Do not the associations founded on the 
idea of Schultze Delitzsch pay depositors on demand with accumulated interest? 
The fundamental principle of banking is not the length of time of the deposit or 
of the loan, but of ability to meet the demands of the depositor, and this is done 
by lending to parties whose paper another bank will discount in case of need. 
The Raiffeisen associations conform to this principle of banking. They have 
three resources: (1) The repayment of short-time loans (generally made for one or 
two years); (2) the long-time loans are subject to a sinking fund or repayment by 
installment operation, which practically reduces them to several short-time loans; 
and (8) the ability to borrow from other capitalists to repay the one demanding 
his money, in the guaranties they have to offer—and what establishment possesses 
the guaranties offered by the Raiffeisen system of Darlehenskassen, possessing, as 
they do, from ten to sixty times the amount of their debt? It is not to be supposed 
that a powerful coalition of large bankers would attempt to wreck the system. 
Establishments giving credit have, it is true, been ruined by this means, but 
these wrecked banks were undermining the speculations of those who coalesced, 
to ruin them. The very essence of the being of ‘‘agricultural credit,” on the 
Raiffeisen principle, is not to speculate so as to make money, but merely to attract; 
money where it will not flow unless the banks which have it to lend can be assured 
that it will be returned. And, strange as it may appear, in times of public finan- 
cial doubt, as during the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, the Raiffeisen societies were} 
obliged to refuse the deposits that were offered to them without interest. But 
suppose a, still greater crisis, suppose every commercial house, savings bank, banks

of issue, and, finally, the State, shall have bankrupted. Under such extraordinary 
conditions the societies that guarantee agricultural credit may fail without dis- 
honor. During the twelve years of prosperity in Germany, from 1875 to 1886, 
with no war, no commercial crisis, 200 of the societies founded upon the grand 
conception of Schultze Delitzsch became bankrupt, which in itself is a very suffi- 
cient answer to his second charge against Raiffeisen’s profound modification of 
his Vorschussvereine to adapt it to an agricultural society. 
The third and fourth charges are in reality but one. The Raiffeisen society, 
according to Schultze Delitzsch, can not exist, can not stand on its own feet, since 
it is founded upon the principle of philanthropy and not of business, and it there- 
fore lacks the mainspring of prosperity, the spirit of gain. In reply, it is to be 
said that Raiffeisen recognized the absolute necessity of self-help, but he labored 
to procure it in a manner which will not expose the brotherhood of peasants to 
the danger of being fleeced or used by the sharper members of the organization for 
their own personal benefit under the pretense of placing a precious opportunity in 
the hands of each laborious and worthy member. As to the very lively attacks 
made upon the undistributed reserve fund, to the exclamations of pity for the poor 
peasants who are creating a fund which they will never enjoy, it is to be remarked 
that as the fund increases the interest paid on loans will decrease, as the money will 
come cheaper. At least it is a precaution that has been taken to prevent too high 
an interest being asked. Such are Mr. Durand’s responses. But to those who see 
the rate at which the rural populations are crowding to the cities the accumulation 
of a local fund coming to one generation from its predecessor has a meaning, 
especially when each generation is compelled to add in its turn to the total by its 
own saving, thus keeping constantly in view the means, the only means, by which 
such a fund may be created, as also the value of money in the form of cash, not 
for pretentious ‘internal public improvements,” the opportunity of contractors 
and their friends, but for private enterprise in its efforts to support a family in 
the slow and legitimate round of unostentatious living.'

xistence. The income is now (1896) $617,506, of which $588,144? is enjoyed by 
stitutions either specifically or practically for the Caucasian race, and $21,752 
y three institutions specifically for the American negro. This amount is not 
ermanent, as there are two elements that will cause it to fluctuate. One of these, 
he rate of interest, will tend, probably, to decrease until every State has reached 
the limit fixed by the Federal law, which is 5 percent. The other element of 
shange is the increase which the lands still held by several Western States will 
ield to the agricultural and mechanical college fund of each of those States par- 
icularly, and to the whole fund considered for all the States generally. To illus- 
rate these fluctuations in the productive value of the fund derived from the sale 
f the 9,600,000 acres granted by the Federal act of 1862, either as land or “scrip,”

been 5 per cent. Ineleven States the figures are exactly the same for 1892 anc 
1896, which seemingly indicates a guaranty by the State of a fixed rate of interes 
which has not been changed during the four years included in the compariso1 
above. In Michigan there has been an increase of $16,918 in the income derives 
from the State fund, or 65 per cent, while in New York there has been a decreas 
of over 41 per cent ($7,500) and in Missouri a decrease of 20 per cent. The incom 
received by the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College has been reduced 
at least for 1895-96, to nearly one-fourth of what it has been—that is to say, ha 
been reduced to $2,190. But this is not due to any loss of the fund, as the Stat 
holds unimpaired the original fund of $165,000, upon which it has hitherto pai 
an interest of 6 per cent per annum. 
As remarked above, the Federal law of 1862 requires the fund derived from thy 
land granted by the act to be invested in safe stocks yielding an interest of no 
less than 5 per cent per annum on their par value.!_ Considering, therefore, th: 
the States, in accepting the conditions imposed by the Federal law, have guara: 
teed interest at that rate, the income of 1895-96, $617,506, would represent, if ca: 
italized, a principal of $12,263,000 as the product of the sale of the 9,600,000 acr 
of public lands granted in 1862, not counting the unsold lands of Michiga: 
Nebraska, Missouri, etc. At the close of the year 1890, however, 5 per cent woul! 
have been too small an interest upon which to capitalize the principal. At th 
date, perhaps, even 6 per cent would have been too low, though most of the Stat 
gave that interest to their respective agricultural and mechanical colleges 
agricultural and mechanical departments in their universities. Assuming, the: 
that the income of $617,506 derived from the fund created by the Federal act 
1862 is probably about 6 per cent of that fund, the fund would then amount 
$10,219,000. It is safe to assume that the fund is in the neighborhood 
$10,000,000, which, therefore, constitutes the present permanent and producti 
endowment of colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts. Su 
an amount at 5 per cent, the lowest legal rate, will produce $500,000 annually f

Missouri and Rocky Mountain region are obligated, by the provisions of the la 
admitting them into the Union, to hold the lands granted them for education: 
purposes until those lands will realize $10 an acre. Such a provision in the act 
1862 would have realized $96,000,000, or an income, at 5 per cent, of $4,800,000.

The main sources of support of the colleges of agriculture and the mechanic ai 
are the funds created by the Federal acts of 1862 and 1890 and, indirectly, or rath 
so to speak, sympathetically, the fund created by the act of 1887 for State expe 
ment stations which, with two exceptions, are part of the college in the sai 
State. But these colleges are State institutions as well as national. Like the ci 
zen of a State, they have a double function in the Republic. Congress, howev: 
in subsidizing them, has left the control in the hands of the State or of the Te: 
tory. It is to be expected, therefore, that the State or Territory will feel an int 
est in the colleges practically created and in a large measure maintained for th 
and through them by the national purse. In Delaware, in New Jersey, in Ni 
York, and in Tennessee it is to be remarked that this interest is not represented 
appropriations of money, at least during the year 1895-96, and the appropriatio: 
in Oregon and Florida are for repair of the buildings, the latter State appropri: 
ing rather liberally in view of the great disaster it experienced during the unpre: 
dented frosts of the winter of 1894-95. 
  
1In the case of New York, Nevada, Minnesota, and Florida the fund, it appears, has 
invested in Government and State bonds paying ‘‘less than 5 per cent.”

The aid derived from the State may be classed under three heads. To name 
them and the amounts appropriated under them— 
1. Appropriation for current expenses... 
2. Appropriation for building (mainly) - 
3. Income from endowment granted by State = $1,257, 048

149, 486 
2,218, 100   
     
   
                                                           
    
    
   
        
    
          
    But these appropriations are in some cases for instruction in subjects not named 
in the act of August 30, 1890, among the subjects calculated to directly benefit 
) agriculture and the mechanic arts. It is therefore requisite to ascertain how 
much was actually spent by these universities and colleges for instruction in the 
subjects specified in the act of 1890. Such an amended statement will take the 
following form: 
Amount received from State for current expenses for all departments. $1, 257, 048 
Amount received from State for building (mainly) for all departments 811, 566

Total expended for other than subjects specified in act of 1890.........--..-------- "2, 782, 982 
But the figures of the above statement require still further consideration. The 
gross sum of the item ‘“‘ Amount received from State for current expenses” is very 
largely contributed to by the total grants to several State universities (Ohio, Ili- 
nois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska, and California) and the State College of 
Pennsylvania. The appropriations to these seven institutions, in which the tech- 
nical work is done in colleges of the university, amount to $800,000, or 64 per cent 
of the grand total received from the States by the fifty institutions for the Cau- 
casian race within the Union. Again, the amount of the item ‘‘ Income from fees 
and other sources” looks very large, but its importance is reduced when it is 
shown how unevenly it is distributed among the fifty institutions, for one-half of 
the amount, that is to say, $759,000, is contributed by Cornell University and the 
‘Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Let us exclude the Massachusetts Insti- 
tute and include in the computation the universities of Cornell, Mlinois, Wisconsin, 
land California. Even then it is found that 50 per cent of the sum total received 
iby the aforementioned fifty institutions from “fees and other sources” is paid 
into the treasury of four universities, all founded upon Mr. Cornell’s idea of a 
niversity—where anyone can come and learn anything. 
Leaving now the matter of State aid, the subject of the annual national aid 
ay be in turn examined. Other than the grant of two townships to provide for 
university, and the grant of 500,000 acres for internal improvement (act of 1841), 
he grants made by the Federal Government have been a grant per capita or by 
ctual extent of territory (sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections in each township for 
chool purposes). Thus the surplus revenue deposit of 1836 was distributed 
ccording to representation in Congress, as also the grant of land given by the 
ct of 1862. But by the act of 1890 Congress placed all States upon the same foot- 
mg by granting to each an equal amount. The way in which the institutions 
ave distributed the amount in expending it is given in the following statement:

  1246 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
It is quite certain that much which is reported to this Bureau as expended for 
“natural science” may be included as instruction in agriculture. Horticulture, 
however indefinite the term may be, ranging from ‘“‘ market gardening ” to orchard. 
growing, is, it would seem, more nearly related to agriculture than it is to natural 
Pe or physical science. The same may be said of veterinary science, and even, per- 
haps, of agricultural chemistry; yet these applications of the sciences in the 
“garden or orchard,” in “animal pathology,” and in agriculture are frequently 
returned as natural or physical sciences. This distribution of one university is 
interesting from the emphatic way it reports under agriculture, to wit: 
[Amount received from Morrill fund alone.]

said college. 
    
    
   
   
   
   
       
     
This university under the head of natural science gives one item, namely, 
physics, throwing back civil [‘‘RR”], electrical, mechanical, and experimental 
engineering to the general head of the applied science called mechanic arts. 
It is thought that the variation of the reports in classifying the subjects o! 
instruction is probably due to there being one professor for sciences so nearl 
related as chemistry, botany, and meteorology are to agriculture. 
The manner in which the science of construction or the engineering science: 
have been classified presents quite as much diversity as the biological sciences. 
spoken of in the preceding paragraph. Engineering and the scientific generaliz 
tions and the applications of mathematics in representing its facts are divided w 
among three of the five heads given in the form sent to the treasurer of each insti. 
tution, to wit, natural science, mathematical science, and mechanicarts. One insti- 
tution will do this in one way; another in quite a different way. To illustrate: 
INSTITUTION A. 
[All under mechanic arts.] 
Mechanical engineering (one professor). 
Electrical engineering (one professor). 
Marine engineering (one professor). : 
- Experimental engineering (one professor). 
Mechanical drawing (one professor). 
INSTITUTION B, 
[Under head of mathematical science.] 
Mechanics, hydromechanics, bridge building, differential calculus, and integra] calculus (on 
professor). 
Mechanics, astronomy, and calculus (one professor). 
Algebra, descriptive geometry, and drafting (one professor). 
[Under head of physical science.] 
Physics, elements of mechanism, and electrical science (one professor). 
The most notable diversity of classification is, as might be expected, in the cas| 
of civil engineering, which is about as frequently placed under mathematic: 
science as under mechanic arts.‘ There is some diversity also in the location ¢

    drawing. In general, however, it may be said that when one subject is confided 
to asingle professor the arrangement is this, despite the ambiguity of the term 
mechanic arts: Engineering (whether mechanical, electrical, experimental, or 
civil), shopwork, and drawing are placed under mechanic arts; mathematics, 
pure and ‘‘ applied,” under mathematical science, and the general or ‘‘ elementary” 
laws, which matter obeys or the so-called ‘‘natural philosophy,” under physical 
science. 
In order to ascertain what was meant exactly by the terms civil engineering, 
mechanical engineering, etc., this Bureau, several years ago, made a critical 
examination of the programmes of the larger technological institutions in Europe 
and America, the result appearing in volume 2 of the Commissioner’s Report for 
1889-90, where the matter is discussed at some length. 
III. Farmers’ Instirures.! 
The agricultural experiment station, says Prof. John Hamilton, deputy secre- 
tary of agriculture and director of farmers’ institutes in Pennsylvania, after having 
endeavored to assist farmers by solving questions of interest to them and then 
disseminating the solutions among them, found that many farmers, by reason of 
their lack of scientific training, were unable to understand the full force and 
application of these results. Thus there was created a necessity for persons 
familiar with science and its relation to practice to go out into the country dis- 
tricts and explain the meaning of the experiments and their practical value. From 
this necessity grew the modern farmers’ institute.’ But this institution reaches 
jback further in the history of this country than is commonly supposed and reported. 
In 1799, Count Fellenberg had established at Hofwyl, in Switzerland, the agri- 
ultural school of that name. ‘The rational agriculture,” said this enthusiast, 
‘which will proceed from Hofwyl and will penetrate not only every district of 
witzerland but of the whole civilized world, is the instrument for the physical 
nd moral regeneration of mankind.” é 
The first notice published in America of this experiment was by ‘‘ Professor Gris- 
om, of the New York school,” but the account given during 1830-31, in the Ameri- 
an Annals of Education, by W. C. Woodbridge, its editor, who had resided at 
ofwyl off and on for nine months, is far more interesting. While Fellenberg 
as building up a love for agriculture in Switzerland, Albrect Thaer, a student 
f the then flourishing agriculture of England, established his experimental farm 
+ Celle, whence he was called by the King of Prussia to create, in 1804, the ‘‘first” 
igher agricultural institute in existence (héhere Lehranstalt fiir Landwirth- 
shaft) at Méglin. Thaer, the author of the formerly well-known work on the Prin- 
iples of Rational Agriculture, stipulated that there should be attached to the 
chool an experimental farm, as nothing in his opinion is so educative in agron- 
my, considered in a practical sense, as the ability to see processes in operation 
nd to handle the implements of culture.* Let it not be supposed, however, that 
1The basis of this section, except the historical part, is the information collected by Prof. 
ohn A. Woodward, of the Pennsylvania Experiment Station. The Bureau is indebted to Mr. 
liver D. Schock, chief clerk of the department of agriculture of Pennsylvania, for the docu- 
nents containing an account of the institute work of that department. 
2 Address before Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, 
ovember 11, 1896. 
3Hisidea was expressed by the King of Prussia, William III, when this school was subsequently 
ade a part of the University of Berlin, as follows: There must be connected with the univer- 
ty, as an essential part an institute organized for the purpose of illustration (ein musterhaft 
ngerichtetes institut), which would exhibit the relation of theory and practice, upon which 
slation the instructor could base his instruction and in which institute the student might learn. 
the use of the word institute here will be familiar to those acquainted with the “ pathological 
id chemical institutes” of the German universities, being our “Americar laboratories fitted 
it with a director and a full faculty of instructors.”  
-P-A-G-E-290
    1248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
the foregoing statement is intended to make the assertion that Thaer’s experi- : 
mental farm (perhaps a synopsis of English practice) was anything more than a 
place for exhibiting proper methods of cultivating the soil. The real scientific 
experiment station based on organic chemistry made its first appearance. during 
the thirties upon the farm of Brechelbronn, in Alsace, under the direction of 
Boussingault, and in 1842 at Rothamstead. 
In Scotland the earliest agricultural association was established in 1723 as the 
Society of Improvers in the Knowledge of Agriculture in Scotland, but it is said 
that the tenantry took no interest in it, inasmuch as they are always unwilling to 
adopt the practices of those who cultivate land for amusement. During the 
period from 1795 to 1815 it is said that the substantial education of the parish 
school of Scotland had diffused through all ranks such a measure of intelligence 
as to enable the Scots to promptly discern and skillfully and energetically take 
advantage of the spring tide of prosperity produced by the constant wars on the 
Continent of Europe and further to profit by the agricultural information then 
plentifully furnished by the Bath and West of England Society (1777), the High-| 
land Society (1784), and the National Board of Agriculture (1793). 
But to return to America. A national figure at once attracts attention. The| 
earliest proposal for promoting ‘‘ useful knowledge among the British plantations} 
in America” was made in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin. The society contemplate 
by this proposal, among other matters, was to aim to improve the breeds of usefw! 
animals, the cultivation and the clearing of land, for ‘all philosophic experiment: 
that let light into the nature of things tend to increase the power of man an 
multiply the conveniences and pleasures of life.” It is only necessary to add tha‘ 
the society for the promotion of knowledge among the people established in 182 
is called the Franklin Institute, to say nothing of the Brooklyn Institute of 1823, 
the Albany Institute of 1824, the Smithsonian Institution of 1838, and the Coope 
Institute of 1852, all of them apparently catching as an ideal expression at th 
name of the Institut de France, into which were combined by the first Frenc! 
Republic the so-called learned bodies styled academies before the French Revolu 
tion.! 
In 1824 Stephen Van Rensselaer, of New York, employed a very able gentleman 
Prof. Amos Eaton, with a competent number of assistants and sufficient apparatu; 
“to traverse the State on or near the route of the Erie Canal and to deliver in al 
the principal villages and towns familiar lectures, accompanied by experiments an 
illustrations in chemistry, natural philosophy, and some or all of the branches o} 
natural history.” This scientific and educational journey through the State w: 
made during the summer of 1824 and ‘aroused a prodigious interest.” 
It is readily seen thatthis idea is not new as far as the method is concerned, and 
only remains to speak briefly of a possible defect which the method may contai: 
The higher instruction of France, or, in American phraseology, post-gradua‘ 
jnstruction, was at one time given in the form of public lectures. The result 
this was very. unsatisfactory, not only to those who had the desire to study, b 
to the professor who desired to instruct. ‘‘ What could be more humiliating,” sa; 
Ernest Renan, in speaking upon this delicate topic, ‘‘ than for the professor to fin| 
himself before an audience made up of idlers and other persons whose time hun 
heavy on their hands, whom he was compelled to amuse; for his success was con 
parable to the merit of the Roman actor whose end was attained when it could 
said of his performance, ‘Saltavit et placuit’—he jumped and he pleased.” 
There are thirty-two States having farmers’ institutes. One-half of these a: 
under the auspices of the agricultural colleges or experiment stations, and tl 
other half under those of the State board or department of agriculture. The late

form of organizing these institutes is shown in the law passed by Michigan in 1895, 
which follows: 
“Snction 1. The people of the State of Michigan enact. That the State board of 
agriculture is hereby authorized to hold institutes and to maintain courses of 
reading and lectures for the instruction of citizens of this State in the various 
branches of agriculture and kindred sciences. The said board shall formulate 
such rules and regulations as it shall deem proper to carry on the work contem- 
plated in this act, and may employ an agent or agents to perform such duties in 
connection therewith as it shall deem best. 
“Suc. 2. When twenty or more persons, residents of any county in this State, 
organize themselves into a society to be called the county farmers’ institute 
society for the purpose of teaching better methods of farming, stock raising, fruit 
culture, and all the branches of business connected with the industry of agricul- 
ture, and adopt a constitution and by-laws agreeable to rules and regulations fur- 
nished by the State board of agriculture; and when such society shall have elected 
such proper officers and performed such other acts as may be required by the rules 
of said board, such society shall be deemed an institute society in the meaning of 
this act: Provided, That not more than one such institute society in any county 
shall be authorized by this act: And provided further, That any existing organ- 
ization, approved by the board of agriculture, shall be considered a legally organ- 
ized institute society under the terms of this act. 
«Sno. 3. In each county where an institute society shall be organized under the 
provisions of this act, the State board of agriculture shall hold one annual ihsti- 
tute, two days in length, at such place in the county and at such time as said 
board may deem expedient, and shall furnish at least two speakers or lecturers, 
with all expenses paid, to be present at all sessions of the institute. The county 
institute society shall provide a suitable hall for the institute, furnish fuel and 
. lights and pay other local expenses, and shall provide speakers who shall occupy 
one-half the timo of the institute that is given to set addresses: Provided, That 
upon the request of any local institute society who desire to conduct their own 
institute the State board of agriculture may, in their discretion, appropriate from 
the institute fund, money, not to exceed twenty-five dollars, in lieu of the speak- 
ers provided for by this act, said money to be expended by said local institute 
society entirely in institute work. 
“Sno, 4. If the funds appropriated by this act will permit, the said board of 
agriculture may hold a number of four-day institutes, at such places and times as 
said board may determine, at which the primary object shall be to furnish aschool 
of instruction in practical agriculture and kindred sciences. 
“Sec. 5. The State board of agriculture shall maintain the course of reading 
known as the Farm Home Reading Circle, and may expend from the moneys 
appropriated by this act a sum not to exceed two hundred dollars for each of 
the two years for which the appropriation is made for the maintenance and exten- 
sion of said course. 
“Suc, 6, For the purposes mentioned in the preceding sections the said board 
of agriculture may use such sum as it shall deem proper, not exceeding the sum 
of five thousand dollars in the year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred ninety- 
six, five thousand dollars in the year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred 
ninety-seven, and such amounts are hereby appropriated from the general funds 
of this State, which said sum of five thousand dollars shall for each of the years 
eighteen hundred ninety-five and eighteen hundred ninety-six be included in the 
State taxes apportioned by the auditor-general on all the taxable property of the 
State, to be levied, assessed, and collected as are other State taxes, and when so 
assessed and collected to be paid into the general fund to reimburse said fund for 
the appropriations made by this act.”

Nineteen States favor a centralized control; four think it should be in charge of 
local managers. It is thought by at least one manager of State institutes that 
local talent is very inadequate to meet the demands of science. The general rulé 
in the selection of speakers by the management.is this: The official speakers are 
selected by the State or college authorities having charge of the work, and the local 
speakers by the local committee. But the answers seem somewhat scattering. 
Maryland would have the speakers selected by the local committee with reference 
to needs of communities; Minnesota wants practical men, and Miss‘ssippi sends 
the men who caa be spared most easily from the work of college and station. This 
matter of the selection of speakers may be dismissed by putting the weight of the 
opinions in the form of ‘ official speakers to open the road and local men to lead 
the audience in discussion.” 
The number of sessions held at each meeting varies from one to six, but in gen- 
eral the opinion is that there should be either one or two days devoted to the 
institute, and that in the case of the one-day institute there should be three ses- 
sions, and in the case of the two-day institute there should be five sessions. The 
number of sessions held during the winter varies considerably. Michigan, Towa, 
and New Jersey have 1 in each county; Delaware has 4 to 6 in each county; Ala- 
bama, Georgia, Kansas, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island have from 20 to 25; 
California, South Dakota, and Mississippi have from 12 to 16; Indiana and Wis- 
consin have 100 or more; Ohio, 150; New York, 250; Missouri, Minnesota, and 
Maine,in the neighborhood of 50 or 60 each; Idaho, 2, etc. Some of the States 
spedk highly of the summer institute. 
The attendance at these meetings is given in round numbers, except in the case 
of Wisconsin, where there was an attendance of ‘‘494 at last year’s meetings,” 
and Ohio, where the attendance was 423.3. In Delaware the attendance varied 
from 30 to 200 each; in Georgia, from 50 to 500; in New York, 100 to 800; in 
Indiana it was 250; in Idaho, 100; in California and Mississippi, 200, ete. All the 
States reply that the interest and attendance is increasing. The great majority 
of the States also find a marked increase in the intelligence and critical character 
of their audiences, demanding a higher order of ability and special training on 
the part of the speakers. Thus Maine reports, ‘“‘Speakers who did good several 
years ago are of no use now.” New Jersey reports that after a good institute, 
university extension lectures have been demanded, and, when obtained, supported. 
At least half a dozen other States speak with similar emphasis; others are not s> 
positive. The work in the institutes is reported to have had considerable effect in 
improving the methods of culture employed in working the soil, especially in the 
localities which have exhibited a lively interest in the work of the institute. The 
majority of States think that the institutes should be increased in number and 
advanced in character. Two or more want to invade the remote rural regions, 
where much inissionary work is possible. : 
In ten States all expense is paid out of State funds. In one all the cost is upon 
the county. In six States the agricultural college and the local committee divide 
the cost between them. In one the university pays it all. In another the college 
faculty volunteer, the railroads furnish passes, and the local managers entertain 
the speakers and furnish the hall. In all others the State furnishes a fixed part 
of the expenses, and the local managers furnish the residue. Where appropria- 
tions have been made directly by the State, they have been increased. The 
amounts now appropriated by these States are:

The speakers are paid $2, $3, or $5 per diem; in Delaware they are paid accord- 
ing to value, from $5 to $20 for a lecture. Some States pay only expenses; others 
a per diem and expenses. Wisconsin pays $25 for four days’ work to the conductor, 
$20 to his regular assistant, and $5 per diem and expenses to others. The exact 
cost of an institute in Ohio was $69.04. In Wisconsin, in the winter of 1894-95, 
it was about $58, though for the eight preceding years it had been about $110. 
The system of farmers’ institutes is very thoroughly organized in Pennsylvania. 
The institute in that State is a propaganda not only for good farming, but for 
good housekeeping, good sanitary surroundings, and good roads. In addition to 
this there is an educational session of a very practical and otherwise valuable 
nature, in which the “proper education for country children ” is discussed in con- 
nection with country graded schools and township high schools, In fact, the 
sample programme published by the agricultural department of Pennsylvania is 
so interesting and suggestive that it has been inserted here in reduced form, the 
original circular being composed of four octayo pages on good paper and well 
printed.

SPECIAL NOTICE, 
The foregoing order will be followed as closely as possible, but other exercises will be intro- 
duced if found desirable. : Speeches, essays, and papers ought not to exceed twenty minutes. The papers, when read, 
are considered the property of the Department of Agriculture. s 
Although these institutes are designed and conducted for the education and advantage of 
farmers, yet all who are interested are invited to attend, and it is hoped that they will show 
their appreciation, not only by being present at the meetings, but also by taking part in the 
discussions. 
    ASK QUESTIONS. 
‘A question box will be kept upon the secretary's desk, and all are invited to place therein such 
questions as they may wish to have discussed during the session. At a proper time, designated 
by the meeting, these questions will be referred to some one for answer, or brought up for gen- 
eral dise ion. 
All granges, alliances, agricultural societies, and kindred agricultural organizations are spe- 
cially invited to attend.

IV. THE AGRICULTURAL COURSE IN THE FRENCH COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE. 
It is evident to anyone who will take the trouble to survey the field of agricul- 
tural curriculums that, though the term ‘‘education” is popularly synonymous 
with ‘‘school,” and ‘‘degree” with “learning,” the ‘‘agricultural college” is by 
no means the same thing as the ‘agricultural course.” As the reason for this 
seems rather unobvious, it may be permitted to the compiler of the foregoing 
matter to enlarge upon the subject. 
Tn the first place, it is important to recall that each one of us is aware not only 
of his own personality, ‘‘the thing he calls himself,” but also of an infinitely varied 
panorama or series of phenomena outside himself, which he instinctively insists 
is not a mere modification of himself. Equipped with this reflection, it may now 
be said that in the early educational process, whether on the banks of the Nile, the 
Euphrates, or the Seine, men gathered together in monastic-like establishments 
for the purpose of elaborating the spiritual self and fashioned a method of accom- 
plishing their object, which in a wonderful degree facilitated the growth of lan- 
guage and confidence in logical soliloquy, or, as Bacon calls it, the intellectus sibi 
permissus.! Dissatisfaction having set in with this method of education, owing 
to astronomical proof of its limitations when it attempted to account for physical 
phenomena, man turned to the consideration of the world without him as to a 
sphere of matter of fact, and this new process or education was called at first 
philosophia experimentalis, to distinguish it from the intellectus sibi permissus 
philosophy, as elaborated by the Greeks, from what, so it seems, they had an 
  
1 Nec manus nuda, nec intellectus sibi permissus multum valet; instrumentis et auxiliis res 
perficitur. Novum Organum, Aph. Il. (Neither the naked hand nor the intellect thrown back 
upon itself amounts tomuch. Investigation requires instruments and aids.)

opportunity to pick up in Egypt and Mesopotamia in their naive educational 
effort to free the human mind from coarse superstition and brutality by diffusing 
knowledge, even though, as Plato claimed, they manufactured it for sale.! 
Thus throughout the history of education since the Reformation we have two 
systems of education, one old and established, which is based on the development 
of the self within, and the other based on what is from without and distinguished 
from self; and this new education proceeds by the widest accumulations of facts 
and their reduction to so-called laws. But though the methods of these two sys- 
tems as instruments for the instruction of the young are opposed, they agree in 
having the same object, which is to train the pupil to reason rightly and to go out 
into the world with a love of simplicity, of independence, and of work; a passion 
for justice, a disdain for hollow declamation and falsehood, and a contempt for 
vain distinctions and ill-acquired riches; in short, their object is to inculcate the 
virtues of perseverance, courage, respect of family, and all the solemn plausibilities 
of anoble life. In organizing this new or so-called scientific instruction, however, 
the monastic, form of congregation into educational temples has been followed. 
We have had seats of learning rather than a diffusion of learning, though now 
those seats have entered upon the instruction of the people with an enthusiasm 
that it is hoped may not be prematurely chilled by a comprehension of the diffi- 
culties and the Herculean labors of the task. 
The study of agriculture is the study of nature. Agriculture is not a branch of 
chemistry or of botany, but chemistry and botany are branches of it. It is not 
dependent upon industry, but industry is dependent upon it. Minerals existed 
before vegetation, and it is the province of vegetation, in a biological sense, to 
convert mineral matter into food. Thus the course of an agricultural college is 
an encyclopedia of sciences, and the following remarks are an effort to illustrate 
the so-called agricultural course in the curriculum of the French agricultural 
colleges by the other concurrent courses. 
DISCIPLINE IN FRENCH AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES. 
The students of the French colleges of agriculture are treated in the same way 
as those of the literary colleges called lycées; that is, all exuberance is repressed by 
certain monitors or surveillants who watch, under the authority of the director of 
the school, for infractions of order and discipline among the students. Each col- 
lege has two of these gentry and one a surveillant-général. The average age of 
the students on admission is 19 to 20 years. ‘‘ The long school hours and the con- 
stant supervision in the French colleges are favorable to discipline, and the French- 
man is born with a turn for military precision and exactitude which makes the ~ 
teacher fall easily into the habit of command and the pupil into that of obedience. 
French teachers who have seen English schools are struck with the greater loose- 
ness of order and discipline in them, even during class hours, and I have seen? 
large classes in France worked and moved with a perfection of drill that one some- 
times finds in the best elementary~schools in England, but rarely, I think, in 
English classical schools.” 
The ‘‘notation” of examinations adopted by the national French schools of agri- 
culture runs from 0 to 20: 0 = nothing (néant); 1 and 2 = very bad; 3, 4, and 5 = 
bad; 6, 7, and 8 = mediocre; 9, 10, and 11 = passable; 12, 18, and 14 = pretty 
good; 15, 16, and 17 = good; 18 and 19 = very good; 20 = perfect. The stand- 
ing is obtained in the following manner: For students of the first and second 
year, take the average df marks of the particular examinations and practical 
tests held by the repetiteurs during the year and multiply it by 3, then the aver- 
age of the marks obtained at the general examination at the end of the course

and multiply it by 5, and then the average of the marks obtained as a result of 
practical tests at the end of the course and multiply it by 2. Add the three prod- 
ucts thus obtained and divide the sum by 10 and the quotient will show the 
standing of the pupil. If he has obtained 11 (for first year) or 12 (forsecond year), 
the student is promoted. For students of the third year (or fifth session) the 
average of the marks for the examinations and tests during the year is multiplied 
by 2, while the average of the practical tests of the final examination is multiplied 
by 8, the other features remaining the same. The standing of the graduating 
pupils is thus fixed up: The standing of the first year is multiplied by 8, that of 
the second year by 8, that of the third year (one-half year) is multiplied by 4; the 
products are added and then divided by 4. If the final average is 13, the diploma 
of the school is given.! t AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES.

alt is possible to say that the term zootechnie is “ applied * comparative anatomy. 
Itis apparent that these curriculums above given are more specialized as one reads 
thecolumnsfrom lefttoright. In fact, the Grand Jouan Collegeis influenced by the 
idea of an extensive farming such, perhaps, as is necessary in breaking up new land 
and reducing it to an agricultural state until it approaches the tilth of a garden, 
Its instruction is, therefore, more condensed than] that of the Grignon College, 
where much more stress is put on botany and chemistry as becomes an institution 
championing the intensive farming idea, while the Montpellier College, situated 
in the wine-making and silk-growing portion of France, has a complete course for 
grape growing (viticulture), for silkworm raising (sericulture), and for wine _ 
making, etc. (technologie). In the same way it might be expected that the Ameri- 
can colleges in California and Florida might strive to make specialists in “‘ agres- 
trian arboriculture,” or as the Floridians say, ‘‘ grove culture,” while in Ken- 
tucky and Virginia tobacco growing and its industrial preparation might be the 
bias of the college, and in Alabama and Mississippi cotton, and in Louisiana sugar 
might be matters that the States concerned would find it advantageous to push in 
the institutions that have been endowed by the Republic. 
We sce that each French college has from six to twelve courses, but that one of 
these, namely, the course in agriculture, comes first in-every case; for, though th> 
Montpellier College includes under agriculture the cultivation of the mulberry 
  
1 The college at Grignon is taken to illustrate this feature of the French system. M. Philippar 
is director of this college, and M. Dehérain, the author of the well-known Cours de Chémie

and olive tree, whica of course are not commonly regarded as vegetables, as they 
occupy the ground for many years, yet it should be remembered that a bed of 
asparagus (certainly a vegetable) is said to be capable of lasting twenty years if 
well prepared. Let us, then, take the course of agriculture in each of these 
colleges and compare them with each other and then with the other parts of the 
curriculum. 
THE OBJECT OF THE AGRICULTURAL COURSE. 
The Grand Jouan College! under the agricultural course comprises the study of 
(1) the vegetable soil—that is to say, the agricultural workshop (l’atélier agri- 
cole); (2) fertilizing matters—that is to say, the food of plants; (3) work of the 
fields (the handling and use of agricultural tools); (4) the most useful p!ants, 
and (5) rotation of crops. Although this instruction has reference more particu- 
larly to the regions of the west and center, it never loses its broad and general 
character. Nevertheless, over 100,000 acres of the ‘‘department” in which the 
school is situated are waste lands, and it is said by the technical secretary of the 
national agricultural society of France that the system of culture is as yet semi- 
pastoral, though, thanks to the efforts of M. Rieffel, the founder of the Grand 
Jouan College, a ‘‘ considerable step” in advance has been made. 
Leaving the upland prairies of the coast for the environment of Paris, we find 
the management of the school of Grignon striking a different note. Here is what 
is said in the annuaire for 1893: ‘‘Grignon desires to give young men who wish to 
become agriculturists the sum total of those scientific and practical ideas which 
are recognized as indispensable for good cultivation of the soil; to turn out men 
who will know the researches of agricultural industry and its conditions of exist- 
ence; men capable of choosing, selecting, and applying different methods; men 
who join to a knowledge of economic science a profound knowledge of the techni- 
cal details of the profession of agriculture; men, finally, who shall either on their 
own exploitations in the councils of the countty, or in the professional chair, be able 
at need to successfully develop the principles and facts which shall clear up hazy 
discussions which disturb agricultural interests.” Here we evidently have a school 
of agricultural politics or statesmanship. 
The College of Montpellier owes its foundation to the wine makers of France 
and its importance to a native of America, the phylloxera. ‘The début of the 
school was not very satisfactory, for the viticulturists of southern France, justly 
proud of the results they had accomplished by an intelligent management of their 
business, had no particular use for aschool. But very soon—following the arrival 
of the phylloxera—the aspect of things changed.”* Here we have a school for 
forming agricultural specialists or scientific police, or physicians, especially neces- 
sary for a certain class of vegetables, such as grapevines and fruit trees, whose 
lease of life and whose unproductive period from seed to bearing are long.

It will be interesting to compare the mere outline of the above course in agri- 
culture with the outline of our own institutions. Some years ago the American 
Agriculturist referred to our agricultural colleges as not having succeeded very 
well, with two exceptions—one in the East and one in the West. Possibly what 
may have been true long before the act of August 30, 1890, is not true to-day, but 
as both the colleges excepted have by no means retrograded during the interval 
that has elapsed they may be taken as examples of the most successful institu- 
tions of their kind. We will take the Grand Jouan College to represent the 
French curriculum:

As far as the number of hours is concerned, the above table does injustice to 
the French College. This Bureau has as yet failed to obtain the (manuscript) 
emploi de temps,! which of course varies from session to session, and the remarks 
which follow may not perhaps be strictly true of the French College whose course 
has been given, though true of one of its fellows or of the lycées of France, these 
lycées being the institutions which prepare for the bachelor’s degree. The dura- 
tion of a professional lesson (legon) is one and one-half hours. The first one-half 
hour is given to questioning upon the matters which had been presented in the 
preceding lesson. The professor thus assures himself that those matters are under- 
stood. After the lesson of one hour experimental demonstrations are given, and 
in addition to this each student is questioned at least once a month by the répé- 
titeur (coach or tutor, or, literally, one who demands back—in Latin, repetitor) 
attached to each branch of the curriculum. Of these under teachers or repetiteurs 
there are at Grand Jouan five, each of whom aids the professors in making the 
applications of his remarks and in the manipulations. In addition they comple- 
ment his work by ‘‘conferences” and examine the students. The chief gardener 
and the chief of agricultural work also hold conferences and the military exer- 
cises are under a special instructor. Again, the instruction at Grignon is both 
scientific and practical. In addition to the lessons given in the amphitheaters 
(lecture rooms), and to the laboratory work, are the daily observations collected by 
contact with actual cultivation, the work in the botanic garden, in the arboretum, 
market garden, and fruit tree (dwarf) garden, and in the dairy, sheepfold, and 
stables. 
The students are charged with all the ‘‘services” of this exploitation for fifteen 
days (1st and 16th of each month), which services consist of the service of culture 
(gardening, plowing, etc.), of animals and the barnyard (cour), of engineering 
and operating machines, of the demonstration plots, and of the gardens, of the 
botanic school and the collections, and finally of meteorological observations and 
such other services as may be necessary. The different services are each confided to 
astudent of the second year, as chief, and two students of the first year. Each day 
a surveillant posts the names of the students who are to perform the different 
kinds of “‘ practical work,” but the evening before the students who are to perform 
it, knowing their turn perhaps, call upon the director to learn the part they are to 
perform upon the morrow, and they are required to note what they have observed 
during the course of the work in their scholastic notebook (cahier). 
The curriculum of the six courses of the Grand Jouan College has mainly occu- 
pied our attention in the foregoing, but it may be interesting to those unfamiliar 
with the order of procedure in a French agriculture course, properly so called, to 
examine the manner in which the course is developed in the Grignon College. A 
translation of this course follows.

  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1261 
SYLLABUS OF THE AGRICULTURAL COURSE PROPER, TWO AND ONE-HALF YEARS, 
WHICH IS ONE OF THE NINE COURSES IN THE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE OF 
GRIGNON, FRANCE. 
Agriculture, properly so called, its importance, and the variety of knowledge it 
requires because (1) of the character of the formation of the soil, (2) of the mul- 
titudinous influences which affect production, (3) of the variety of agricultural 
products. All these make it dependent upon the sciences of geology, mineral- 
ogy, chemistry, physics and meteorolgy, botany, mechanics, and rural engineer- 
ing. The subject of agriculture will in this school be considered under (1) 
agrology,or the study of the surface of the earth as to its origin, composition, 
and physical and chemical properties, then (2) will be taken up the study of the 
means employed to modify the physical and chemical properties of the soil by ~ 
application of matters to its surface or by cultivation, then (3) will be considered 
the different agricultural plants, and finally (4) the rotation of crops. 
I—AGROLoeY. 
[The compiler has allowed himself the liberty to run the bald statement of each fact into a 
connected account,and he must be held accountable for everything in the translation except 
the names of the things taught and their order.] 
The soil and subsoil—the vegetable stratum—origin of the soils. The compo- 
nent parts of the soil and the importance of studying them and (a) mineral eie- 
ments which are furnished by the rocks, which are primitive, eruptive, sedimen- 
tary, or metaphoric. This leads us to examine more particularly (1) the elements 
which form the backbone, so to speak, of the soil (squellette du sol), to wit, sand, 
clay, lime, and (2) the less strongly represénted elements, to wit, phosphoric acid, 
sulphuric acid, potash, magnesia, and oxides of iron. 
Having thus studied the mineral elements as just given under a, we now pro- 
ceed to study (b) the organic elements—humus and its origin, composition, and 
réle—nitrogen, and different states in which found in the soil as waste organic 
matter, ammonia, and nitrates. Then follows a study of the soil as a sort of 
sponge, bearing first upon its physical properties and then its chemical properties, 
to wit: The soil considered in respect to its weight and its volume, or density; 
then in respect to the implements of culture (tenacity, cohesion); then in its rela- 
tions with water (permeability, capillarity, etc.); then in relation to solar heat 
and the causes which interfere with the action of heat upon the soil. We now 
pass to the chemical properties of soil—the fixation of gases and absorption of 
fertilizing matter. 
Thus, having gone over the organic elements of the soil and the physical and 
chemical properties which enable the soil to clutch the fertilizing matters com- 
ing in contact with it, we proceed to examine the relation of soil and climate, to 
wit: Necessity of completing the ideas relative to the properties of a soil by those 
relative to the environment; special necessity of studying climate in this respect as 
dependent upon geographic situation, height above the sea, shelter, distance from 
large masses of water, frequence of rains, influence of snow, climatic divisions of 
France. Classifications of soils by Varro, Thaér, etc., and classification adopted by 
this college, which is based (1) on what mineralogy teaches us about its chemical 
composition, (2) the size of the particles which compose it, which is the most impor- 
tant factor of the physical properties of the soil. By these considerations we are 
thus led to establish the following division: Sandy (rocky, stony, gravelly, coarse, 
fine, clay sand, calcareous sand, and calcareous clay sand, or ‘“ terre franche ”?); 
1 The terre franche is the perfect soil. It ispermeable, thanks to itssand. The clay restrains 
evaporation and anchors the sand, while the lime acts advantageously upon the clay, or, in the 
old couplet, ‘Clay on sand manures the land; sand on clay is thrown away;” in other words, - 
heavy clay needs lime or drainage.
-P-A-G-E-304
1262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
volcanic soils; lime soils (rocky, etc., fine powder, chalky, soft limestone, as in 
Kentucky, and marl); clay soils (lime clays, sand clays); schistous soils; humus 
soils (peaty, marshy, etc.); oxide (or silicate) of iron soils, i. e., ferruginous soils 
(ferruginous sand, clay, or lime soils); magnesian soils (dolourite sands, calcareous 
magnesian lands, magnesian clays). Finally are taken up the importance of the 
depth of soils and the influence of the subsoil. 
Il—Srupy or THe Means EMPLOYED To Mopiry THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND THE 
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF SOILS. 
In the foregoing we have familiarized ourselves with a knowledge of what 
nature has placed at our disposal and the way in which she has arranged it in 
different localities, and the infiuences which she brings to bear upon it. This 
study in France is called agrology, though it might as well be called agricultural 
or soil physics, the formation of the agricultural soil being due to the action of 
atmospheric phenomena upon the rocks. We have now to consider the utilization 
of the nature of the soil, which from an ideal standpoint should possess: (1) The 
proper physical properties, (2) a good mineral composition, and (3) organic mat- 
ter. New soils rarely unite in themselves these three conditions, and the farmer 
endeavors to create them by introducing one of the three backbone mineral ele- 
ments or a fertilizing material either of a mineral or organic nature, to wit: (1) 
By dumping sand, clay, or lime in some form upon it; (2) by manuring it with 
vegetable matter, turning under green crops of various kinds, seaweeds, rushes, 
skins and pulp of grapes and other fruits which have been through the press, etc.; 
(3) by animal fertilizing material—blood, flesh, waste from fisheries, hair, feath- 
ers, horns, leather, guano, fecal matters, urine, etc.; (4) by mixed fertilizers— 
barnyard manure, city scavage (boues des villes), composts, street or road sweep- 
ings, deposits in stagnant water (vases), and sewage; (4) chemical and mineral 
manures—bones, natural phosphates, superphosphates, chloride of potassium and 
sodium, sulphate of ammonia, chlorhydrate of ammonia, etc.; and, finally, (5) by 
cultivation, such as paring and burning, i. e., scobuage, meaning, however, not 
the burning of the clay crust, but of a fibrous one, colmatage, i. e.. the manner of 
elevating the surface of a soil by letting the muddy water of a stream flow in upon 
it, drainage, breaking up, the kinds of cultivation by various instruments, spade, 
plow, harrow, etc., in regard to depth, form, whether in round ridges (billons), 
flat ridges (planches), or flat; cultivating and weeding and hilling up (buttage). 
TiL.—Srupy oF THE DIFFERENT AGRICULTURAL PLANTS. 
Having studied the soil in its scientific aspect—that is, as to its formation and 
the opportunities it offers to man, and then the method that experience has shown 
to be the best for man to follow in availing himself of the work that nature has 
done for him, or holds out hopes of doing for him—it now follows in course to 
study the vegetable which is (by leave of the new-discovered agricultural or nitrog- 
enous microbe) the living organism which converts the minerals or gases held in 
suspension in water into a structure which, as forage or fruit, fodder or seed, is 
the food of animals. First, then, plants mainly cultivated for their seed, such as 
wheat, rye, wheat and rye sown together (meteil), oats, barley, maize, millet, and 
sorghum. Then follows the care and preservation of these cereals before and after 
thrashing, in mills, granaries, and silos, and the manner of such preparation. 
After the cereals, or gramineae, come buckwheat, to represent the polygonacez; 
then the various kinds of beans and pease, to represent the leguminose. Thestudy 
of forage plants is introduced by a consideration of natural pastures, and then (a) 
the characteristics of artificial pastures put down to grass for mowing, etc., prepa- 
ration of the soil, choice of seed, sod, regeneration, irrigation, care, returns, cur- 
ing, breaking up; (b) pastures [permanent?], their proper situation, care, and 
exploitation; (c) meadows [herbages?], proper soil and climate. The foregoing
-P-A-G-E-305
  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1263 
are (probably) permanent, whether created by nature or man. We now come to 
the consideration of temporary pastures, their importance, composition in regard 
to plant life, etc.; then follow pl , cultivated for their roots or tubers, and the 
preservation thereof; then plants cultivated for their stalks and foliage, and the 
curing thereof, either by drying or siloing; trees whose leaves answer the pur- 
pose of fodder; industrial plants, and, finally, plants of ‘‘ grande culture,” as 
pumpkins and cabbage. 
IV.—THE Rorarion OF Crops. 
The last subject is the.order in which the soil should be cropped. Definition of 
the term ‘‘assolement” (sole being the feminine form of sol, soil, but is used to 
designate a field or other division of the farm): Relations which should exist 
between the rotation and the agricultural, economic, and climatic conditions; 
periods of rotation and examination, and discussion of the principal types. 
Norr.—The professor, accompanied by a repetiteur.and a chief of agricultural 
practice, makes the excursions which are necessary for the topographic study of 
the surrounding country. The school is so favorably situated that one finds within 
aradius of 12 miles—a distance not exceeding a day’s walk—every variety of soil 
from chalk to peat, while the clay plateaux permit a study of very varied climates 
and special soil formations. Within the school the students are exercised in the 
grooming of draft animals and harnessing and driving them. They learn the 
make-up, the outline, and the handling of the various agricultural tools and 
machines. They sow by hand and machine, dnd are familiarized with the work of 
cultivation and harvesting. They are obliged to learn all the duties of the farm 
under its superintendent, and to perform work which is of a nature to make them 
habile and adroit in the management of machines, and thus cause them to acquire 
by a consciousness of ability to perform (par le savoir-faire) that authority which 
is indispensable to a director of a farm.   
  V. THE PossiBiLiry OF IMPROVING AGRICULTURE. 
IL—TE 2THOD (IN TERMS OF HINDU AGRICULTURE).! 
  On one point there can be no question, and that is, that the ideas generally 
entertained in England, and often given expression to.even in India, to the effect 
that Hindu agriculture is as a whole primitive and backward and that little has 
been done to try and remedy it, are altogether erroneous; for the conviction is 
forced upon the investigator that, taking everything together, and more especially 
considering the conditions under which Indian crops are grown, they are wonder- 
fully good. 
At his best the Indian “‘ raiyat” or. cultivator is quite as good as, and, in some 
respects, the superior of, the average British farmer, while at his worst it can 
only be said that this state is brought about largely by an absence of facilities 
for improvement, which is probably unequaled in any other country, and that 
the raiyat will struggle on patiently and uncomplainingly in the face of difficulties 
in a way that no one else would. The lacking facilities are water and manure, 
for nowhere can one find better instances of keeping land scrupulously clean 
from weeds, of ingenuity in device of water-raising appliances, of knowledge of 
soils and théir capabilities, as well as the exact time to sow and reap, as one can 
in Indian agriculture; and this is not said of its best alone, but of its ordinary 
level. It is wonderful, too, how much is known of rotation, the system of ‘‘ mixed 
crops,” and of fallowing. Nevertheless, while some have condemned all attempts 
    
1 Report on the Improvement of Indian Agriculture, by John A. Voolcker, Ph. D., ete., Con- 
sulting Chemist to the Royal Agricultural Society of England. Dr. Voeleker was sent by the British Government as a commissioner to examine and report upon the improvement of agri- 
culture in India.
-P-A-G-E-306
  1264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
at improvement, asserting that the raiyat knows his business best, others have 
equally erred by calling his agriculture primitive, and, forgetting that novelty is 
not necessarily improvement, have thought that all that was needed was a better 
plow, a reaper, a thrashing machine, or else artificial manures to make the land 
yield as English soil does. On one point, however, there can be but little doubt. 
The native, though he may be slow in taking up an improvement, will not hesitate 
to adopt it if he is convinced that it constitutes a better plan and one to his 
advantage. 
The first aim in any scheme of agricultural improvement should be to modify 
those differences which exist; first of all, by teaching in the more backward parts 
of India the better practices of the most advanced Indian agriculture; and sec- 
ondly, by supplying, wherever it is possible, those facilities which exist in the 
best agricultural districts. It is in the existence of these differences that there is 
a warrant for the belief in the possibility of improving Indian agriculture, and it 
is in the modification of them that the great hope of improvement lies. These 
differences and the best way of modifying them appear to be—- 
1. Differences inherent to the people themselves as cultivating classes; for 
instance, the fact that by hereditary practice certain castes and races are bad, 
others are good, cultivators. 
2. Differences arising from purely external surroundings and not directly from 
any want of knowledge, to wit: 
(a) Physical causes, such as climate, soil, facilities for water, manure, wood, 
grazing, etc. 
(b) Economical or political conditions, such as are the relative ease or difficulty 
of living, paucity or pressure of population, etc. 
8. Differences arising directly from want of knowledge; for instance, the exist- 
ence of diversity of agricultural practice in different parts of the country. 
Having thus stated the differences, it is desirable to consider, in the next place, 
the means by which they may be removed, or, at least, modified: 
1. The modification of existing differences in agricultural practice and methods 
must proceed from positive measures taken— 
(a) By the people themselves. 
(b) By the Government. 
2. So far as it is possible for Government or for agricultural departments to 
assist in the modification of these differences, it is their duty to do so. 
3. It is the work of Government to test Western practice and the applications 
of modern science as also to introduce them when found suitable for India. 
It will be well now to illustrate the foregoing differences and indicate how their 
modifications may be carried out. 
1. Differences inherent to the people themselves.—It is well known that certain 
castes and races have been prevented by religious prejudices or ‘‘ historical causes ” 
from adopting the more skillful or laborious systems of cultivation in vogue among 
other castes or races. Thus the Rajputs, Brahmans, Kolis, and Kols may be 
mentioned as hereditarily inferior as cultivators to the Jats Kurmis, Lodhas, 
Kachhis, and others. Here it is not so much that the external surroundings are 
unequal, nor that agricultural knowledge is at fault, but the real cause is found 
in the inherent differences of the people themselves. Side by side in the same 
village one may, for instance, see both superior and inferior husbandry, the 
explanation being primarily in a reference to the respective caste of the cultivator 
in each case. In Behar, I (Dr. Voelcker), on seeing a quantity of dung lying 
about in heaps on a field, not spread out, but between the rain and the sun speedily 
losing its goodness, asked a neighboring cultivator why the owner did this. The 
reply was, ‘‘ He is only a goatherd,” meaning thereby that he did not belong toa 
good cultivating class. Here the people of this caste evidently required to be 
taught better methods of agriculture and how to manage properly the manure at
-P-A-G-E-307
AGRICULTURAL AND ‘MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1265 
their disposal. The modification of such differences will, in some Cases, be effected 
by the people themselves in the gradual abandonment of their prejudices and the 
adoption by them of more profitable (practices. A change of this kind has been 
seen in the adoption of indigo cultivation by castes who formerly considered 
indigo an unclean thing. Another instance.is the extension of cultivation of the 
potato, against which a religious prejudice existed on the ground that it is 
“flesh.” The work that Government can do and is its duty is to assist in raising 
the level of the people through the spread of education. This will continue to do, 
as it has already done, a great deal to break down prejudice. Further than this 
the Government can do little, if anything. 
2. Differences arising from purely external surroundings.—(a) Physical causes: 
These may be subdivided into climate and soil and facilities for water, manure, 
wood, grazing, etc., and first climate and soil. These stand in a different cat- 
egory to the others. They are fixed by geographical and geological considerations; 
over them neither the people nor Government have more than a limited control, 
and consequently comparatively little can be done to modify the differences. For 
instance, it is not possible to compare agriculture under the influence of a damp 
climate and abundant rainfall, such as prevails in the greater part of Bengal, or 
below the western ghits of Bombay, with that of the dry parched plains of the 
Multan and elsewhere in the Punjab. Equally impossible is it to find a resem- 
plance between the rich black cotton soil of Berar or the central provinces and the 
sandy soils of Sirsa or other parts of the Punjab. The planting of\trees may indi- 
rectly modify the rainfall, and plentiful manuring may improve the poorer soil, 
but they will be powerless to make the one locality or soil really like the other. 
In regard to facilities for procuring water, manure, etc., we have a set of phys- 
ical causes giving rise to differences which, unlike those in the case of climate and 
soil, it is in the power both of individuals and of Government to mitigate toa 
considerable extent. Marked, indeed, are the differences between parts plentifully 
supplied by wells or through which streams or canals flow and those where these 
features are absent. So, again, the differences are great between the treeless tracts 
and those in which forests abound, the latter giving alike shelter, grazing, and 
wood, besides causing a saving of manure to the land. Much has been done in 
the past, and more may yet be done, to mitigate the differences resulting from the 
existence of this class of physical causes. The people in certain dry localities have 
dug wells, constructed tanks, and taken channels off streams. On the other hand, 
in some parts valuable land has been recovered by means of drainage or by the 
construction of dams, made either by the people themselves or by the Government, 
through its engineers. In the matter of wood and grazing supply, natural differ- 
ences have, in many parts, been intensified through the reckless extirmination of 
forests by the hand of man, or through excessive grazing with cattle and sheep, 
and more especially by goats. But although the people are likely to do little to 
remedy this, yet it is in the power of Government to save what is remaining 
and to provide ‘‘reserves” for wood, fuel, and grazing, whereby, too, the supply 
of manure to the land may be saved. It becomes, therefore, one of the most 
important duties of agricultural departments to ascertain and point out what 
measures are possible for the judicious modification through Government agency 
of differences resulting from such physical causes as the above named. This can 
only come as the result of close and careful inquiry as to what the needs of each 
locality are and how they may be best supplied. 
(b) Economical and political conditions: There are cases to be met with, e. g., 
in parts of the central provinces of Bengal and of Madras, where, owing to the 
natural richnoss of the soil, the sparsity of population, or other causes, there is 
not the same struggle for existence as is felt elsewhere, and as a consequence the 
agriculture is often found to be inferior. Here the change will only come with 
the inevitable disturbance which time and increasing population will cause in the 
   
-P-A-G-E-308
GY 1266 | EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
easier circumstances under which the people in some parts live at present as com* 
pared with those in others. 
8. Differences arising directly from want of knowledge.—There are many instances 
of the cultivation of one district being inferior to that of another, not on account 
of caste differences, nor yet’on account of external and unfavorable physical sur- 
roundings, but simply because a better practice has not been known; or, again, 
an implement is not in use in a district, though employed advantageously else- 
where, or cattle are poor because not properly fed, or manure is wasted (more 
especially the urine) because there is no litter to conserve it, or crops are inferior 
in yield because seed is not carefully selected. The want of knowledge and the 
lessening of the local differences arising therefrom can not be supplied directly 
by the people themselves, but they may be by the State, partly by means of edu- 
cation and partly by the introduction of better methods from localities where 
they are known to those where they are unknown, but their application to which 
is both feasible and desirable. This can not be done without systemati¢ prosecu- 
tion of agricultural inquiry, which must precede any attempt at agricultural 
improvement. Such an inquiry can only be effectively carried out by a permanent 
agency closely associated with the existing authorities in each State. Further, 
the assistance of an expert with special knowledge of the application of chemistry 
to agriculture is desirable in any such inquiries. 
IL—THe Mpans (EMPLOYED oR SUGGESTED) 
In Coina (LA Crrk Curnoisz, Srmon?). 
Limiting the scope of our examination to China, properly so called, it may be 
said to have an area of 1,250,000 square miles, or about one-third of the area of the 
United States, upon which lives a population of over 400,000,000 people. Europe, 
with an area four or five times as great, has scarcely 337,000,000; but there are in 
China provinces as large as France or Germany where 5, 6, and even 7 inhabit- 
ants may be averaged to the 24 acres; and there are districts as large as Belgium 
where this density exceeds 12 and even 15 inhabitants to the 24 acres (hectare). 
No country of Europe, with the possible exception of the Isle of Jersey and the 
Province of Valencia in Spain, is comparable in this respect with China. This 
density is so extraordinary that it has frequently been contested as a hoax, but it 
is apparent to those who have had the opportunity to travel over the vast territory 
of the Chinese Empire. Out to the frontiers of Thibet, 2,400 miles from the sea, 
it frequently happens that the traveler passes through cities of 500,000 to 1,500,000 
people, and in the most distant provinces he frequently journeys along with 
crowds which are going to a fair (aux marchés), where are gathered 15,000 or 
20,000 persons at a place previously comparatively unpeopled. From one end to 
the other of China, so to speak, villages, hamlets, cottages follow in such quick 
succession that the country is like the environs of one of our great cities. Never- 
theless the Chinese continue to consider the multiplication of the species a virtue. 
‘They have no doubts about the future. If the surface of a field is measurable, 
who has ever been able to measure its fertility? But it is necessary to say that the 
Chinese are very economical in regard to everything which serves to augment the 
fertility of the soil. They do not export the wealth of their country by turning 
the sewage of their farms and cities into the rivers. 
Quite the contrary. The Chinese coilect the waste products of human existence 
and consider it an act of justice, to neglect which would be sinful, to return 
to the earth what she has loaned. Aryan and Semitic forms of worship are 
inspired by a contrary doctrine. In them, work is a chastisement, from which it 
is the universal desire of all to be delivered, but the Chinese do not recognize the

servility of labor, and the professions that we call liberal and those of the artisan 
are upon the same footing as far as professional precedence isconcerned. A brick- 
layer or carpenter is not less estimated than a physician, and receives about the 
same pay.! What a difference is there, then, between Chinese agriculture and 
ours. How erroneous to think that for a long period it is possible to replace the 
wooing of nature by tricking her; manure by big machines! The Chinese ask 
nothing from the land which they have not solicited by the application of labor 
and plant food. This may not be agricultural science, but it is agricultural 
sagacity. The secret of Chinese agriculture may be given in two words—work ~ 
and justice (to the soil). 
IN HOLLAND (REPORT OF MICHAEL G. MULHALL, STATISTICIAN ay 
Holland has been aptly described as a kingdom scooped out of the ocean, one- 
third of its area being below sea level. The Dutch have expended more than 
$1,500,000,000 on levees or dikes to keep out the sea and to guard against the over- 
flow of the Rhine at certain seasons. They have, moreover, reclaimed 45,000 acres 
by pumping out Lake Harlem, a work which took thirteen years to accomplish; 
and now they propose to pump out the Zuyder Zee, which will give them 520,000 
acres of meadow land, at a cost of $150,000,000. Their manner of life is almost 
amphibious, for it may be said that while the husbandman with one hand sows 
grain he is bailing out water with the other. In whatever direction you go, the 
scene is the same; fields separated not by hedges but by water courses; windmills 
whose sole occupation is pumping water from one canalintoanother. These canals 
have a total length of 1,920,000 miles, or sixty times the circumference of the globe; 
and the total area of the country being only 8,000,000 acres (one and one-half times 
as large as Massachusetts, with twice its population), there are 420 yards of canal to 
every acre. There are three kinds of canals: (1) Those which serve for navigation; 
(2) those used by men and women for skating to market in the winter time, and 
(8) the smallest kind, serving merely for drainage or irrigation. How Holland 
can support in comparative opulence so large a population, having neither coal, 
iron, nor any manufactures worth mentioning, is a problem for the economist, 
which is perhaps only explained by the thrift and industry of the people. There 
is here no indication of agricultural depression, hard times, nor struggles between 
capital andlabor. The peopleand the Government are on the most friendly terms. 
In religious matters, too, the relations are enviable. In fact, for a well-ordered 
country, it would be difficult to imagine anything better, for all classes seem 
equally bent on living in good fellowship and doing their best for the public 
welfare. 
IN DENMARK (REPORT OF THOMAS P. GILL$). 
The population of Denmark is 2,200,000. At the end of the last century it was 
one of the poorest countries of Europe. To-day it is one of the richest, and that 
progress in wealth is almost entirely represented by its progress in agriculture; 
in short, butter, pork, and bacon. But before entering into details it is neces- 
sary to mention that the leading agriculturists of Denmark insist on attributing 
the intelligence and capacity for organization of the Danish farmers and the x 
enlightened relations which they had been capable of establishing with their   
1Says Tcheng Ki Tong, of the Chinese embassy at Paris, in the Revue des Deux Mondes 
(first June number, 1884, page 601, also page of the second June number), ‘To give the fact, 
the two cl which are esteemed and honored in China are the highly instructed class (the 
literary public-examined class), and the agriculturists. These two classes constitute the aris- 
tocracy of mind and of work. Our gentlemen are enly able to inscribe in their coat of arms 
either a pen (or rather pencil) or a plow. The one class has heaven for its horizon [sic], the 
other the earth—the infinite and manual labor.” (La Chine et les Chinoise.) :

Government to two special clauses: (1) The education received by the peasantry in 
the peculiar institutions which they call rural high schools; (2) the distribution of 
land amongst small freeholders. In the high schools men peasants of 18 to 30 
spend five months of winter, and women three months of summer, receiving an 
education which leans chiefly to the human side, and gives but a secondary place 
to the scientific and technical side, the object being to develop the heart, mind, 
and will. The agricultural authorities in Denmark, when questioned on the sub- 
ject of education, have almost always replied that apart from the advanced, special- 
ized study of agriculture in the university stage—a stage of scientific research— 
they rely more upon the ‘‘ highly developed common sense” of the Danish farm- 
ing class, as brought out by their [peculiar?] high-school education and their 
system of organization, for the spread of improved methods of farming, than they 
do upon any special technical training in the schools. 
IN SWITZERLAND (LA CRISE AGRICOLE—DROZ!). 
Despite the shortcomings that may be urged against our Swissagriculture, wehave 
best recognized the necessity of changing the character of our products. Since the 
railroads bring in grain and meat at a price which defies all competition, we-have 
been forced more and more to relinquish the culture of the cereals and the pro- 
duction of beef. Switzerland has seen that her soil produces with infinitely more 
profit certain highly flavored grasses which are in reality the base of her milk 
industry. This industry she has therefore developed, and so advantageously that 
the products enable her to buy her bread and meat more advantageously than 
if she had obstinately persisted in attempting to produce them herself. It is neces- 
sary for the agriculturists of each country to have their eyes open to their true 
interests, and to give a new direction to their activity whenever they find it 
necessary or advantageous to do so. The State may aid individual enterprise by 
creating experiment stations, and by endeavoring to disseminate a healthy agri- 
cultural instruction (une saine instruction agricole). But there is in general no 
universal solution of the problem which is presented to each farmer, who must 
exercise his own judgment in selecting the branches of his vocation which will 
turn out to be the most lucrative under his own conditions. 
IN IRELAND (RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE “ RECESS COMMITTEE.” ? 
We haye in Ireland apoor country, practically without manufactures, dependent 
upon agriculture, with its soil imperfectly tilled, its area under cultivation decreas- 
ing, and a diminishing population without industrial habits or technical skill. 
Leaving aside the question of the causes of this condition of affairs, the great fact 
we have to deal with here is that agriculture is now not only the main, but, over 
the greater portion of the country, the sole Irish industry. It being the industry in 
which the greater portion of the working population is now actually engaged, it is 
in connection with this that the industrial habits, which must eventually spread 
through every class, can soonest be implanted. How, then, is our agriculture capa- 
ble of improvement? That it is capable of some improvement is a proposition 
which we need not argue. Ours is by common consent one of the simplest and 
most barbarous systems of agriculture in western Europe, both as regards the want 
of variety in the crops and the scantiness of the produce. 
The first lesson we have to learn, then, is taught by our continental rivals; it is 
the necessity for organization. Agriculturists there have spontaneously organized 
themselves for the protection and advancement of their industry in various forms

Don, the Right Rev. Monsignor Malloy, ete.

of societies, chiefly cooperative. Where the agriculturists themselves have not 
been sufficiently alert to initiate this organization, the State has sometimes gone 
the length of enforcing it on them by law. It is everywhere on the Continent now 
recognized as a principle (1) that the action of the people themselves through 
industrial combination is more important than the action of the State, and (2) 
that the assistance of the State can only be truly effective when there exists a sys- 
tem of local representative organizations of the (in Europe) so-called industrial 
classes, to cooperate in its administration. All attempts of the central govern- 
ment to act through unorganized individuals in schemes of agricultural and 
industrial improvements are by implication condemned as likely to do more harm 
than good. . For Ireland this lesson seems to us even more vital than it is for coun- 
tries longer inured to habits of industrial enterprise. The effects of organization 
upon character are even of more value than its economic advantages. It engen- 
ders self-reliance and mutual confidence among the people; it sharpens their intel- 
ligence; systematizes their habits, and opens out to them new conceptions of their 
own powers and of the resources of self-help. Without organization spreading 
pari passu among the people, state aid is in danger of stepping beyond its proper 
limits and may prove distinctively mischievous. <A lavish expenditure of public 
money, which taught the people to lean more than ever upon government and 
still further weaken their backbone, which demoralized officials and the public by 
wastefulness and jobbery, would leave Ireland worse than she is now. 
The Government should aim next at diffusing among the agricultural class 
through the medium of their organizations and through its educational system, 
the most enlightened ideas upon cultivation and upon the latest applications of 
science to agriculture. The method of instruction by traveling instructors is par- 
ticularly noted as being one of the most effective means of improving the methods 
of the agricultural class. 
It will be obvious that a work so large and so various yet in its general purpose 
so homogeneous will require for its due discharge a special machine of government; 
and it is therefore proposed that Parliament should establish a ministry of agri- 
culture and industries for Ireland which shall consist of a board with a minister. 
IN FRANCE (EXTRACTS FROM THE LETTER OF M. TISSERAND!). 
I think that on the present occasion I shall be responding better to your wish 
if I lay before you the ideas which sixteen years’ experience of the working of this 
ministry has suggested to me, and if I tell you what, in my judgment, a ministry 
of agriculture ought to be, what it ought to do, and what it ought not to do, what 
ought to be its rdle in government and in society, how it ought to be organized, 
and of what machinery it ought to consist to insure its regular and useful 
working. 
The first point to be understood is that a ministry specially for agriculture has 
become in our day a necessity, an imperious need in all countries, whether they 
be states of old Europe or countries newly opened to civilization. This arises from 
the fact that everywhere nowadays agricultural and economical questions have 
assumed a capital importance and dominate all others. Everywhere man clings 
to the land; it is the earth that nourishes him, and, like the giant Antzeus, he ever 
has need to touch it, to feel it beneath his feet, in order to renew his strength. 
Itis a general sentiment that on the rational and scientific culture of the soil 
depends to-day the existence and power of nations, 
Formerly tradition, handed on from father to son, sufficed the husbandman for 
the advantageous utilization of the soil. The methods of culture were simple. It 
called for no great effort of the mind to till well, to regulate the rotation of crops

and the breeding of live stock. Everything went on in a restricted circle and the 
son, working as his father had done before him, was able to live comfortably and. 
bring up a numerous family. To-day the situation is no longer the same. In 
this extraordinary century when everything has been profoundly modified by 
steam, when distances have disappeared, and the Australian, with his wool, the 
Hindoo, with his wheat, the American, with his cattle and his dead meat, can 
reach the markets of Europe at less cost than it took the farmer of Yorkshire at 
the beginning of the century to carry his produce to London, old methods and 
paternal traditions have become insufficient for the struggle which has to be car- 
ried on against foreign competition. It is no longer the struggle for life between 
man and man which is the question, it is the struggle for existence between 
industry and industry, between agriculture and agriculture, between country and 
country, and in all directions it is felt that the agriculture of Europe is like an 
old and leaking ship, and that to save it from foundering it needs to be steered 
by abler hands and navigated by pilots who will join to a thorough, practical 
training a profound and extensive scientific knowledge. 
It is under the influence of these apprehensions and menaces, and in face of an 
abnormal and critical situation, that there has come into being in almost every 
country the idea of creating a department of agriculture. This is a response to 
an imperious demand, and means an appeal for the help of all, a grouping and 
marshaling of the strength, the energies, and the wills of all toward a deter- 
mined and definite end—the raising up of agriculture. 
VI. ENGINEERING TESTING LABORATORIES. 
Much space was given to the subject of engineering in the report of this Bureau 
for 1889-90. Since that report has appeared attention has been attracted to anew 
form of an engineering laboratory recently organized or reorganized in Germany.! 
There seems to be some confusion in regard to the character of these institutions, 
not only in connection with their political side, but also in connection with their 
functions as technological laboratories. It is necessary, therefore, to recall that 
the German Empire is composed of twenty-five independent States, each of which . 
has a government independent in matters concerning education of the Imperial 
(Reichs) Government, of which the King of Prussia is head, with the title of 
Kaiser or Emperor. The States of Prussia, Saxony, etc., are, therefore, as far as 
regards education and the management of their own internal affairs, very much 
in the same position as a State of the American Union. But the States of the 
German Empire have assumed control of lines of railroads and telegraphs, etc., 
and apparently exercise a more intimate inspection into the operations of private 
enterprises than is assumed by the States of this Republic, which renders it neces- 
_ sary to employ a trained corps of officers and to have a convenient place for mak- 
ing tests upon which, in the interest of public and private business, so much 
depends. . 
There are in Berlin two institutions for making technological tests. One of 
these is called the Imperial (Reichs) Institution for Physical Tests, and the other 
the Royal Mechanico-Technical Experiment Institute, which is connected with the 
Royal (Kénigliche) Technological University at Berlin This Bureau is not yet 
_ sufficiently informed to enable it to explain the full import of the use of the word 
“Imperial” in connection with the first-named institution, but the organization 
and purpose of the second may be briefly told as follows: 
The object of the Royal (Prussian) Mechanico-Technological Experiment Insti- 
tute at Berlin is to make investigations in the line of general scientific and public 
1Two bills are now before Congiess in regard to the creation of such institutions in the United 
States.

| interest, and, when requested by public or private bodies or persons, to test the 
strength of material, etc. The institute is composed of four divisions, which are 
denominated, respectively, the motal-testing, the building-material, the paper- 
testing, and the oil-testing divisions. 
By the order of the Prussian minister of public works, dated January 7, 1886, 
it was announced that properly prepared young persons might, in the guise of 
unremunerated volunteers, have the opportunity of conducting practical scientific 
experiments upon material used in the sciences and arts. Such persons as desired 
to avail themselves of this permission must obligate themselves (1) to serve for 
three months at least, (2) must obey the regulations of the institute, and (8) must 
finish in the manner prescribed by the director of the division the work assigned 
by him. As far as is compatible with the management of the institute, these vol- 
unteers may be given an opportunity to acquaint themselves with its several 
departments, and in specially suitable cases it is also permitted that the wishes of 
any individual volunteer may be considered in the assignment of work. 
A student of the Royal Technological University at Berlin, if not occupied by 
immediately pressing work, may be permitted to attend the institute by its director. 
In addition to this, an opportunity is given to the students of the technical univer- 
sity to acquaint themselves with the organization of the testing institute and its 
method, through the lectures of the director and the assistant director, and the 
illustrations thereof done with the machines and apparatus of the establishment. 
During the year elapsing from April 1, 1895, to April 1, 1896, there were per- 
formed for public authorities and private individuals 1,352 tests. Two hundred 
of these were done by the division for ‘‘metal testing,” 341 by the division for 
“testing building material,” 687 by the ‘‘paper-testing” division, and 120 by the 
‘‘oil-testing ” division. 
In the course of the year 1895 experiments were made upon Arundo donax as a 
raw material for paper manufacturing, testing the writing paper offered by the 
retail trade, comparative experiments upon the quantity of resin contained in 
petroleum, and its susceptibility to separation, etc. 
The interest evoked by this new moyement—for such it is as far as it is a feature 
of educational institutions—made it desirable to obtain, as quickly as possible, 
more intimate information than was on hand in this Bureau. The specialist in 
foreign exchange, Dr. Klemm, had the courtesy to address a distinguished engi- 
neer and professor of one of the German technical universities, who, with equal 
courtesy, has made the following answer: 
“BERLIN, November 7, 1896. 
“Dear Sir: In reply to your inquiry of October 13, I wish to state that in Prus- 
sia scientific testing stations for the engineering science are only found in Berlin. 
The most important is the Imperial Institution for Physical Tests, an institution 
which has not as yet met the expectations of the engineering fraternity. It has 
from the beginning, and also after the death of Helmholtz, remained in theoretical 
channels, and furnishes, aside from some gauging precisions and tests, very little 
material for engineers, whose needs it very little comprehends. Indeed,a number 
of scientific tasks which were suggested by the association of engineers as desir- 
able have been rejected by this institution, claiming inability to perform them. 
We have therefore appealed to the Prussian Government, asking for means (which 
have been granted) to connect a testing station with the Technological University 
at Berlin for the purpose of instituting scientific tests for engineering problems. 
A building for a machine laboratory is at present in process of erection and the 
extension of existing scientific laboratories is going on. 
‘The mechanic technical testing institute in the Technological University at 
Berlin is the best-arranged institution for tests of material of every kind. An 
account of its work is contained in the publications of the institution. There is

not another institution of its kind in Prussia, but in the polytechnica of Dresden 
(Saxony), Munich (Bavaria), and Stuttgart (Wiirtemberg) there are similar 
institutions, only less complete than the one in Berlin. Outside of Germany, 
Prague (Bohemia, Austria), Vienna (Austria), and Zurich (Switzerland) have 
testing stations in connection with their polytechnica. There are no annual reports 
of these institutions. I might procure the information in printed form, but at 
present I lack the time, and I therefore ask whether it will still be serviceable if I 
send it at the beginning of next year? 
“ Yours, respectfully, A. RIEDLER,” 
VII. NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND CHARACTER OF THEIR STUDIES DURING THE 
YEAR 1895-96. 
There were, all told, 25,723 students in the colleges endowed by the Republic for 
the Caucasian race. Their distribution in departments and the number of each sex 
are shown by the following table:

These students, at least those not in ‘‘other departments,” were instructed by 
faculties whose aggregate number of members was 1,429 men and 110 women; in 
all, 1,539. In addition to the college faculty, the experiment station is credited 
with 431 professors or instructors.

VIII. REPORTS OF PRESIDENTS OF COLLEGES ENDOWED BY THE ACTS OF CON- 
GRESS OF 1862 AND 1890, TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, FOR THE YEAR 1895-96. 
. President William Leroy Brown, State Agricultural and Mechanical College: 
The courses of study in the freshman and sophomore classes, with few exceptions, 
are required of all students, constituting the usual studies recognized as essential 
for a sound general education. Though Latin is not required of all students, 
English is, and in every class from freshman to senior, if enters toa degree. In
-P-A-G-E-315
“AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1273 
the junior year students are permitted to elect any one of the following degree 
courses of study: (1) Chemistry and agriculture; (2) mechanical and civil engi- 
neering; (8) electrical engineering and mechanical engineering; (4) general course, 
including the Latin, French, and German languages; (5) pharmacy. Much 
attention is given to laboratory work, the college being provided with fairly 
well equipped laboratories in the following departments, to wit: Chemistry, civil 
engineering, botany, biology, drawing, mechanic arts, physics, electrical engi- 
neering, mechanical engineering, pharmacy, and physiology and veterinary 
science. Last year a gymnasium of wood was built, 80 by 40 feet, at a cost of 
$1,884, also a greenhouse, 80 by 20 feet, for horticultural investigations and to 
promote the interest of horticulture in the State. 
President John L. Buchanan, of the Arkansas Industrial University: Our 
methods of instruction, stated in general terms, are recitations, lectures, and 
work in laboratories, shop, and on the farm. All the larger classes, especially 
those less advanced, are divided into sections of convenient size, so as,to promote 
frequent drill. Blackboards and illustrative apparatus are largely used. In the 
departments of chemistry and physics, biology, geology, engineering, and agri- 
culture from two to eight hours per week of laboratory and other work is required. 
In English and other languages frequent written exercises are required. We have 
a new machine shop, with office, boiler room, and coal house, which has been 
completed since my last report; cost, about $7,000. These buildings replace those 
lost by fire in April, 1895, but are more commodious, more conyeniently arranged, 
and more substantial. An abundant water supply from the city waterworks has 
been provided in all the buildings, and a sewerage system will be completed during 
this fall. 
President Howard Bellman, University of Arizona: The university is organized 
to give instruction in the following courses: Agriculture, civil engineering, 
mechanical and electrical engineering, mining and metallurgy. We have also a 
general course, which embraces much that is common to the other courses, except 
that instruction in the several branches is not carried so far as in the engineering 
courses. It is designed particularly to meet the needs of young lady students, and 
such others as have not decided upon their calling in life. Special instruction is 
given along certain lines as students may call for it. The year has been one of 
marked progress. The number of students has been doubled, and those entering 
‘have been capable of doing a higher grade of work than heretofore. The advance 
in the mining department is especially noticeable. Many students have somewhat 
vague notions as to what they desire; it is difficult, therefore, to classify them 
early in their course. One new building, now almost completed, has been erected 
during the year., It is a dormitory, and is built of stone, in a very substantial 
manner, two stories in height, containing a dining room and kitchen and lodging 
rooms for about 35 students. Its cost when completed will be $15,000. 
President Martin Kellogg, University of California: There are no changes of any 
importance. Thereisin contemplation, however, a plan for a general architectural 
reconstruction of the university, and when decided on we have a promise of a fine 
building for one of the departments of engineering. 
President Alston Ellis, Colorado Agricultural Coflege: The college is in a highly 
“prosperous condition and is meeting the wishes of the people. We have estab- 
lished during the year a department of domestic economy and a commercial 
department, each of which has been placed under the control of a capable instructor. 
Some of our buildings have been enlarged and others have been repaired, so that 
at the present time the ten buildings found on the college grounds are in excellent 
repair and are admirably suited for the purposes for which they were constructed. 
The number of pupils has more than doubled within the last four years, which is 
a cause of congratulation, in view of the depressed financial condition existing 
throughout the State.
-P-A-G-E-316
    1274 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 2 t 
President B. F. Koons, Storrs Agricultural College, Connecticut: The course is 
essentially that authorized by the act of 1890, and laboratory methods are employed 
wherever the subject will allow. The year ending June 30, 1896, was one of the 
most prosperous the institution has known. There was a slight falling off in 
attendance as compared with the previous year—perhaps owing to the general 
financial depression—yet in substantial work and real growth in those things 
which make for permanent development no previous year equals that just closed. 
We have but one course, or perhaps, speaking more accurately, two, namely, 
agriculture for the young men, and domestic science for the young ladies, The 
courses are the same in most of the sciences, mathematics, English, etc., and 
diverge only when they approach agriculture, agricultural chemistry, veterinary 
science, stock breeding, surveying, etc.,as far as concerns the courses for young 
men. The institution adheres strictly to the labor system, requiring three hours 
of manual labor a day, thus keeping the students in close touch with the indus- 
tries of life. The last legislature appropriated $12,000 for a dormitory cottage of 
wood, for the young ladies, which is now completed. 
President Albert N. Raub, Delaware College: The courses of study are six in 
number, namely, (1) classical, requiring Greek and leading to A. B.; (2) the 
Latin scientific, omitting Greek, but leading also to A. B.; (8) the course in 
agriculture and science leading to B.8., and the three courses leading, respec- 
tively, to B. C. E., B. E. E., and B. Mech. E. Much machinery was added during 
the year. The departmental libraries which were placed last year in the recita- 
tion rooms have aroused much interest on the part of the students. The new 
rule making military science and tactics compulsory on all students below the 
senior grade, with certain exceptions, has been very successfully carried out dur- 
ing the year. | 
President O. Clute, Florida Agricultural College: Our graduating class num- 
bered 13, the largest heretofore being 6. The work of all departments of the 
college is getting into better organic shape, and there is a stronger inclination on 
the part of students to remain longer than three months or a year. The State 
legislature of 1895 gave the college $10,000, of which sum $7,500 was used mainly 
for repairs, equipment, and salaries during the year 1895-96. Considering the 
present financial condition of Florida, this grant is relatively large. Good prog- 
ress is being made in’ the mechanic arts and in horticulture. In technical agri- 
culture much remains to be done and will be done in a time not so very remote. 
President H. C. White, Georgia State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts: 
The condition of the institution is good and the progress made during the year is 
satisfactory. The preparation for admission shows marked improvement as com- 
pared with previous years. The college is much in need of additional buildings. 
President F. B. Gault, University of Idaho: Courses of study that have been 
under consideration for two years have been adopted. The college courses are 
now nine in number. Greater emphasis is placed upon scientific instruction. 
Students may take four years in agriculture, chemistry, botany, zoology, or math- 
ematics and physics. A course in mining has been added; also a course of two 
years in bench work in wood, including wood carving for ladies. One year of the 
course in bench work in woodsis required for admission to the freshman class in 
‘any course. The first graduating class received degrees June 11, 1896, the gentle- 
men taking degrees in B. C. E. The scientific equipment has been largely 
increased. There are now seven laboratories—agricultural, botanical, chemical, 
zoological, engineering, mining, pbysical—besides drafting rooms, woodworking 
shop, and free-hand drawing, all of which are thoroughly well supplied with 
apparatus and libraries, to which additions are being constantly made, An annex 
for assaying has been built, as also a room with basement and annexes for dairy- 
ing, which is well supplied with modern apparatus. Instruction will be given 
next year.

President Andrew S. Draper, University of Illinois: The last year has been 
marked by a liberal increase in students and by the advent of students more thor- 
oughly prepared than formerly. We have erected a new metal-working building 
and a president’s residence in the course of the year, An astronomical observatory 
and a new library building ($150,000) are now in progress of erection. 
President James H. Smart, Purdue University, Indiana: On the 1st of July, 
1896, the board of trustees was reorganized under an act of the legislature. The 
university has maintained a university extension course during the year, and has 
projected what may be known as the Purdue Mechanics’ Institute.’ An assistant 
in physics, another in literature, another in German, and another in electrical 
engineering have been added to the faculty. A series of monographs on sanitary 
science have been projected, two of which have been published under the title of 
(1) Nature of sanitary science and its value to the State; (2) Some sanitary 
aspects of milk supplies and dairying. The front of the new engineering building 
has been completed, and the building was dedicated early in December, 1895. It 
is built of stone and brick, in the most substantial manner, is 150 feet long, 50 feet 
wide, and three stories high, with a tower 150 feetin height. It contains 15 rooms, 
which are used for recitation, drawing, and offices. This gives us an engineering 
plant worth about $200,000. 
  
1 The following letter shows the character of the projected institution: 
“Dzar Str: The authorities of Purdue University are considering plans for the organization 
of a series of lecture courses which shall be especially adapted to the needs of mechanics. The 
plan which soems most likely to succeed involves some features which are new, and members of 
the faculty who are endeavoring to perfect its details feel the need of help and advice from 
those who have had experience in dealing with such men. Therefore, if convenient for you to 
do so, will you kindly look over the outline which follows, and send to the undersigned any com- 
ment or suggestion which may occur to you. 
“The movement is an effort to extend the influence of the university to a class of men who 
have not yet directly profited from its work. Itis believed that if these men, who are so closely 
identified with the material prosperity of the community, could be led to read more widely and 
to think more deeply, their efficiency as workmen would be increased and their usefulness as 
citizens more thoroughly assured. As ameans which may in some measure contribute to this 
end, it is proposed to organize what may be known as the Purdue Mechanics’ Institute. Through 
this organization lecturers, who will present scientific and technical subjects to audiences com- 
posed chiefly or wholly of mechanics, will be sent to the various industrial centers in the vicinity 
of the university. 
‘Tt is proposed to make the lectures valuable from a purely technical point of view, and at 
the samo time, by abundant illustration, to render them sufficiently popular to interest all who 
may attend. It is proposed at first to devote special attention to operatives connected with the 
larger railroad shops, and to extend the work to other establishments as rapidly as the plan can 
be matured. It is possible that under suitable conditions this plan could be extended into sub- 
stantial courses in drawing, mechanics, ete., given in night classes, though at present it is pro- 
posed to organizo for lectures only. 
“In further development of the plan, it has been thought that it would be wise, if practicable, 
to have these lectures given in the shops, and not in a public hall. Sittings upon the benches 
and improvised seats could be arranged, and by not being obliged to go to a public hall the 
men would perhaps feel that the affair was particularly their own. § 
“It is probable that it would be well, also, to make a small charge; as, for example, 25 cents 
for a series of five lectures, though the university is perfectly willing to carry on the work 
without cost to those receiving benefit, if such an arrangement appears to promise best results. 
“That the value of the proposed work may be better judged, the following lecture subjects 
are given from which selections might be made: (1) The great bridges of the world and how 
they were constructed. (2) Steam: What it is and what it does. (3)A history of the steam 
engine. (4) The development of the locomotive. (5) Locomotive testing. (6) A modern trans- 
atlantic liner. (7) The building of a dynamo. (8) Fuels and their use in the industries. (9) Steel 
buildings. (10) The training of an engineer. (11) The transmission of power. (12) The sunbeam 
and its effect on human industry. (13) Lessons from the lives of George and Robert Stephenson. 
(14) Self education, or how a mechanic may educate himself,

  1276 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
President Beardshear, Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; 
The past college year is most marked in the harmony, industry, and thrift of stu- 
dents and faculty alike. The spirit of improvement in buildings has kept pace 
with the upgrowth of recent years. It has been a most encouraging year through- 
out. During the year we have erected a greenhouse, at a cost of about $6,000. 
It is designed for experimental work in horticulture, floriculture, agriculture, and 
the various sections of the experiment-station work. It is composed mainly of iron 
and glass. We have also improved the main farm barn by putting in a new foun- 
dation and thoroughly fitting up the basement with stalls and apartments con- 
taining modern conveniences for the cattle. It is lighted with electricity and 
supplied with water throughout. The total cost is $4,000. We are putting in 
complete system of waterworks, supplying all the buildings, adding efficiency to 
the sewerage system, and affording fire protection. To this end we are sinking a 
deep well, in order to have an adequate and unfailing water supply. <A large 
standpipe is erecting, and will be a prominent help to the system. With every- 
thing complete, the entire system will cost about $36,000. 
President George T. Fairchild, Kansas State Agricultural College: Arrange- 
ments have been entered into by which those students who choose to lengthen 
their course by a year may do so by adding electives during the last two years in 
advanced study of the sciences. In this lengthened course a mention of special 
proficiency in lines of study pursued at least one year is made upon the diploma of 
graduation. The largest class in the history of the college graduated this year, 
and the largest attendance in all the classes shows the increased usefulness of the 
institution. A short course of lectures was given, as usual, in February, but after 
a three years’ trial the lectures have been abandoned, as they failed to attract any 
considerable number outside the immediate neighborhood. The general provision 
for agriculture in the course of study and its adaptation to the wants of farmers’ 
sons and daughters make any special provision in the way of short courses of less 
importance in this State than where no agricultural college appeals directly to 
the young people. No new buildings have been added during the year, but quite 
extensive repairs have been made and considerable additions to the equipment in 
the shops and in provisions for heating and lighting. 
President James K. Patterson, Agricultural and Mechanical College of Ken- 
tucky: Our attendance during the last collegiate year was about equal to that of 
the preceding. With the prices of all farm products so low, there is not so much 
money at the command of the rural population to spend on education as heretofore. 
It is gratifying to note that the matriculation in the college proper as compared 
with that in the academy has shown for some years past a marked advance, The 
veterinary department has been discontinued on account of insufficient attend- 
ance, despite our efforts. Mechanical engineering still takes precedence among 
our courses. The standard of graduation is high, and our graduates in several 
instances have taken a rank in the examinations for assistarit engineers equal to 
that obtained by graduates of the best technical schools in the country. In addi- 
tion to the course of lectures in agricultural science, attendance on which is oblig- 
atory on all, a short course of instruction in agricultural science has been provided 
and extensively advertised, covering a period of about three months during the 
winter. Whether it will succeed in attracting students to this course, I do not 
know. Farmers in the State do not take to an agricultural education for their sons. 
The equipment of the mechanical engineering department has been increased. 
President J. W. Nicholson, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and 
Mechanical College: Our buildings and grounds formerly belonged to the Federal 
Government as a military post, and are thus poorly adapted to college purposes, 
even had they been in good condition when we came into possession. The legisla- 
ture has appropriated $20,000 for a central building, the plan of which has not yet 
been determined upon,

AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1277 
  President A. W. Harris, Maine State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic 
Arts: During the year there have been added the following-named courses of 
study: Spanish, Italian, Old French, eight courses in Latin, and the arrangement 
of a four-years Latin scientific course, modern analytic geometry, advanced inte- 
gral calculus, theory of equations, differential equations, two advanced courses 
in laboratory physics, animal histology, theoretical electricity, power stations, 
eleetrical engineering shopwork. The corps of instruction has been increased by 
instructors in mathematics, Latin, and German, agricultural chemistry, shop- 
work and mathematics, French, and English. The chemical laboratory has been 
restored and enlarged. A new laboratory room has been constructed at a cost of 
about $9,000, giving accommodation for 120 students at one time. 
President Henry H. Goodell, Massachusetts Agricultural College: The college 
has continued to feel the effects of the hard times, and the attendance has fallen 
off in a marked degree during-the year ending June 30, 1896. Other than this, the 
year has been one of prosperity. The personnel remains the same, but the course 
of study has been modified to meet the demands of the hour. It has been deemed 
unwise to carry on longer the two-years course. In its place eleven short winter 
courses have been substituted, all optional, all free to citizens of the State, and all 
without limitation of entrance examination. These are arranged under the heads 
of general agriculture, animal husbandry, dairying, fruit culture, floriculture, 
market gardening, botany, chemistry, and zoology. Three new elective courses 
have been offered in engineering, mathematics, and advanced English. With 
appropriations from the State the following buildings have been erected: A labo- 
ratory at a cost of $3,000, two stories high, 32 by 36 feet, containing stands and 
appliances adequate for instruction of 18 to 20 students in economic entomology; 
and a gun room, at a cost. of $1,800, 28 by 60 feet, providing shelter for the new 
breech-loading steel cannon issued by the War Department, and a shooting gal- 
lery for’ practice during the winter months. In addition to the above, with a 
legislative appropriation of $5,500, the college domain has been increased by the 
purchase of 20 acres for use in the horticultural department. 
Secretary H. W. Tyler, Massachusetts Institute of Technology: The course in 
military science has been greatly improved and much has been added in the way 
of theoretical instruction. The institution received $25,000, the first annual 
installment granted by the State for six years. 
President J. L. Snyder, Michigan State Agricultural College: A number of 
important changes have been made during the year. Heretofore, in order that 
practical agriculture might be taught to best advantage and that needy students 
might have an opportunity to earn money by teaching district schools, the college 
calendar was arranged so that the long vacation took place during the winter 
months. Conditions have changed very much in this State since this plan was 
first put into operation, and it has been decided that inthe future the long vaca- 
tion shall take place during the summer months. The four-years course in agri- 
culture has been rearranged and very much enriched along practical lines. Dur- 
ing the coming winter months the college will offer four special courses in the fol- 
lowing subjects: Dairy husbandry, live stock husbandry, fruit culture, floriculture, 
and winter vegetable forcing. A four-years course of study for women has been 
planned and adopted, to go into effect at the beginning of next school year. This 
course, besides embracing literature, mathematics, modern languages, music, art, 
and electives in fruit culture, floriculture, kitchen gardening, and poultry raising, 
offers an especially strong course in domestic science and household economy. A 
cooking laboratory has been built as an addition to the ladies’ dormitory, at a cost 
of about $1,200. These changes seem to have met the approval of the people of 
our State, and everything looks bright for the future. 
In a paper read before the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and 
Experiment Stations, entitled “What should be taught in our agricultural col-

  SENIOR YEAR. 
'The work of this year is entirely elective, the course for each student being laid out to fit him 
for the particular branch of agriculture or horticulture that he has chosen. For example, if the 
student bas decided to make dairy husbandry his major, he takes bacteriology, 98 hours; chem- 
istry of stock feeding, 140 hours; advanced work in stock judging, 120 hours; advanced dairy 
work in the butter room, 120 hours; veterinary science, 180 hours. 
It his major be field crops, he devotes 250 hours tolaboratory work in soil and plant chemistry, 
the same amount of time to the botanical side of the subject, about the same to work in the field 
on the practical side, and the remainder of the year as he may elect from the list of studies 
presented. 
In the same way, the student that has elected work along some horticultural line selects his 
studies in the senior year in such a way as to make himself thoroughly familiar with the practi- 
cal field work and sciences on which it is founded. 
The other electives offered for the year, with the hours devoted to each, are as follows: Bac- 
teriology, 98; constitutional history, 70; meteorology, 70; advanced physics, 70; veterinary science, 
180; economic zoology, 60; engineering methods, 60; psychology, 60; domestic engineering, 60; 
geology, 50; logic, 50; political economy, 50; French or German, 180, and advanced work in botany, 
chemistry, and entomology. — 
President Cyrus Northrop, University of Minnesota: The college and school of 
agriculture have prospered the past year more than ever before. Progress has 
been made in all departments, notably in agriculture, horticulture, and chemistry, 
for the last of which a most useful course of practical instruction has been pro- 
vided. The State has expended $64,500 in the last year and a half for new build- 
ings, in the following manner: For a dining hall, $42,500; enlargement of dairy

building, $15,000; for a sheep barn, model poultry house, blacksmith’s shop, and _ 
improvement of the barn and swine building, $7,500. Large delegations of farm- 
ers, sometimes numbering 300, have visited the experimental station during the 
year. 
President R. H. Jesse, College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts of the Univer- 
sity of the State of Missouri: Laboratory exercises in all technical subjects run par- 
allel with the class-room instruction, two and one-half hours of laboratory work 
being equivalent to one hour of class work. During the year a complete dairy 
equipment, exclusively for instruction purposes, including different styles of sepa- 
rators, churns, butter workers, testers, pasteurizing apparatus, etc., has been pro- 
vided. An entomological laboratory, with a cabinet of over 8,000 specimens, has 
been equipped for the study of economic and systematic entomology. A herba- 
rium of the fruits and twigs of the leading forest trees has been added to the for- 
estry collection, and more than 700 jars of preserved typical specimens of fruits 
and vegetables have been added to the horticultural laboratory collection. On the 
horticultural grounds are being grown, primarily for experimentation, but used 
also for instruction purposes, 400 varieties of apples, 60 varieties of peaches, 120 
varieties of plums (including complete collection of domesticated Japanese sorts, 
all grown in orchard form), 125 varieties of grapes, 500 strawberry seedlings, 
selected from more than 4,000 seedlings bred here during the past four years. A 
large collection of Japanese, European, and American nuts has been planted dur- 
ing the present year. During this year several hundred seedling plums, hand- 
pollinated cresses of European, Japanese, and American types, and several hundred 
seedling peaches of known parentage have been grown for experimentation and 
instruction. There has been added during the year a horticultural laboratory con- 
sisting of a central building 30 by 80 feet, and two wings, each 22 by 30 feet, 
heated by steam and so arranged that different temperatures may be maintained 
in each compartment. It has stone foundation, pressed-brick walls 3 feet high, 
T iron frames filled with white pine, grooved sash bars, and best American A glass. 
The glass walls in main portion rise 8 feet above the brick walls and 27 feet above 
the floor in the center. Granitoid walks. Connected with the laboratory is a 
brick boiler house 12 by 14 feet, with a 14-horsepower horizontal boiler capable of 
heating the entire laboratory and forcing houses attached. The purpose of this 
structure is the study of methods of hothouse forcing of fruits and vegetables, 
floriculture, and experimental work in vegetable physiology. Cost, $4,500. 
Director Walter B. Richards, School of Mines and Metallurgy of the University 
of Missouri: The school continues to emphasize its technical side and to strengthen 
its courses of study, Pure mathematics and physics have been moved up about 
half a year, so as to give the student at an earlier stage preparation for specializing. 
The chemical laboratory is being enlarged. 
President James Reid, College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Bozeman, 
Mont.: Special attention has been given to laboratory work in chemistry, physics, 
physiology, and botany, two hours of laboratory work being considered equal to 
one hour of class work. Five buildings have been erected for class and laboratory 
work, to wit: A main building 90 by 110 feet, of brick, with stone foundation, 
three stories and basement; a chemical and physical laboratory building in one, 
70 by 90 feet, of brick, with stone foundation, with basement; a shop building of 
wood, with stone foundation; a drill shed of wood, with stone foundation, and a 
veterinary building of stone, two stories high. The main building, laboratory, and 
shop are to be heated with hot-air furnaces. The estimated cost of the five build- 
ings, including furnishing and equipment, is $100,000, raised by bonds secured by 
50,000 acres of college lands received by the State on admission to the Union. 
Chancellor George E. MacLean, University of Nebraska: As never before in the 
history-of the institution, the inseparable union of culture and agriculture, with 
emphasis on the latter word, has been brought out. The new professor of agri- 
   
-P-A-G-E-323
  3 AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1281 
culture has inaugurated a more scientific training in applied agriculture. A 
three-months course in agriculture has been added to the agricultural college. 
Farmers’ institutes have been provided for in the form of university extension, 48 
institutes being held during the year, with an attendance in the neighborhood of 
15,000 people. 
The regents of the university have made provision for the substantial enlarge- 
ment of the quarters for agricultural chemistry, and a separate laboratory on the 
agricultural experiment-station farm will be equipped during the coming summer. 
The course in dairying will be greatly strengthened during the coming year by 
the purchase of apparatus and the erection of a separate dairy building. The new 
- university library building has been completed, at a cost of $110,000. The partial 
crop failures in Nebraska the past two seasons have turned the attention of the 
farmers to the importance of scientific farming, and as a consequence the attend- 
ance in the college has increased, and a general interest in its work has deepened. 
President J. E. Stubbs, Nevada State University: The college of agriculture and 
mechanic arts has laboratory exercises in all scientific and technical subjects, 
shopwork in mechanics, and research in history, literature, and political science. 
This species of work occupies the afternoon of each college day, while class exer- 
cises occupy the forenoon. There is military drill four days in the week, from 
11.45 a. m. to 12.30 p. m. 
To eliminate an element of weakness from the college courses of study and to 
insure a better entrance preparation, the university has organized a preparatory 
department of three years, which requires, for example, two years of French and 
mathematics to solid geometry for admission to any of the schools of science or of 
agriculture. Increased attention is given to English and history in the prepara- 
tory school. The thought of the faculty continues to be directed to the improve- 
ment of the college courses of study, and the attendance of students shows a most 
gratifying increase. In the way of new buildings there has been erected an annex 
to the mechanical building, 50 by 60 feet, one story, containing foundry and black- 
smith shop, costing $3,000. The main portion of this annex, however, is to be 
erected when the legislature has made the appropriation. The old mechanical 
building, the only wooden one on the campus, was destroyed by fire during Octo- 
ber, 1895. A dormitory of brick and stone, three stories high, with basement, con- 
taining rooms for 100 boys and apartments for the head master and his family and 
for the assistant masters, has also been erected at a cost of $27,699. For the accom- 
modation of the young ladies in attendance a structure of brick and stone, three 
stories in height, with basement, has been built at a cost of $14,348. A gymnasium 
and drill hall, 60 by 120 feet, costing $7,000, was built wholly by voluntary sub- 
scription. In addition to these buildings the experiment station building has had 
an addition built to it, 21 by 29 feet, two stories, of stone and brick, costing $1,101. 
The basement is a laboratory for anatomy, physiology, and bacteriology; the sec- 
ond story a laboratory for agriculture and the results of farm experiments. The 
regents have leased a valuable tract of 80 acres of land near the campus for farm- 
ing purposes, the organization of a model farm under the conditions of irrigation 
forming a part of the plans of the university. 
President Charles S. Murkland, New Hampshire College of Agriculture and 
Mechanic Arts: In accordance with an act of the legislature of 1895, a department 
of horticulture and a two-years course in agriculture were established during the 
year, to which students are admitted who can pass a fair and reasonable examina- 
tion in reading, spelling, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, and the history 
of the United States. In this course the student must devote not fewer than ten 
hours a week during the year to practical instruction and manual training in 
branches of agriculture that require special knowledge and skill, one-third of 
which time may be devoted to suitable practical instruction and manual training

in shop work in wood and iron, but any student may be excused from some or any of 
these exercises. To carry the act into effect $25,000 was appropriated for 1895-96, 
and the same amount for 1896-97. The provisional programme for this course is 
given below. The dairy school and institute have been carried on, as well as the 
correspondence course.

President Austin Scott, Rutger’s Scientific School, New Jersey State College 
for the Benefit of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts: The courses in electricity 
and in biology are growing in value to the undergraduates, both in class-room 
work and in laboratory practice, by the constant additions of needed apparatus. 
The course in agriculture is now on a firm basis, the teaching of the subject in an 
elementary way to each member of the freshman class by the professor of agri- 
culture and the assumption of the duties of superintendent of the college farm 
by the same officer affording unusual facilities for instruction in the theory and 
practice of agriculture. No notable changes in the buildings-of the institution 
have been made during the year, theraccommodations and equipment being ade- 
quate for the present. In the general work of the extension department three 
full courses of twelve lectures each, four half courses of six lectures. each, and 
one special course of two lectures have been given, as follows: Two full courses in 
history and one in astronomy; one half course each in history, electricity, English 
statesmen, and art, and one special course of two lectures in art. The total 
attendance at the 62 lectures was 2,011 persons, and the average attendance 1,525. 
The total attendance at the class hours following each lecture was 675 persons, 
and the average attendance 554. Ordinary full-course certificates were awarded 
to 11 persons and honor certificates to 6. Ordinary half-course pass cards were 
awarded to 11 persons and honor pass cards to 2. Attention has also been 
given in the extension department during the year to agricultural work. Two

courses in agriculture and one course in botany, each course of six lectures, have 
been given. The total attendance! at the 18 lectures was 130 persons, and the 
average attendance 119. The total attendance at the class hours was 126 persons, 
and the average attendance 107. Ordinary pass cards were awarded to 3 persons, 
President Samuel P. McCrea, New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic 
Arts: The college has a very complete wood shop and blacksmith shop in suc- 
cessful operation. In the way of buildings there has been added during the 
year an extensive college shop, costing $4,000, which has an engine room, foundry, 
machine shop, drafting room, and physical laboratory. To equip this building 
$5,000 has been set aside by the board of regents, and when it has been completely 
fitted up $12,000 will have been spent in buildings and equipment for the depart- 
ment of mechanical engineering alone. Continued effort has been made in the 
direction of establishing a higher standard of admission and broader and deeper 
courses of study. 
President J. G. Schurman, Cornell University: The buildings for the State 
Veterinary College are seven in number, as follows: The main building, 142 by 42 
feet and three stories high, overlooks East avenue and an intervening park of 220 
by 300 feet. The walls are of dull yellowish-buff pressed brick, on a base of Gouv- 
erneur marble; window and door facings of Indiana limestone and terra-cotta orna- 
mentation. On the first floor are the museum and rooms for the dean and the 
professors of anatomy and physiology. The second floor is devoted to the upper part 
of the museum, a lecture room, reading room, library, and rooms for professors. 
The third floor is devoted to laboratories of histology, pathology, and bacteriology, 
and the necessary subsidiary offices. Connected with the main building and 
forming its east wing is a structure 90 by 40 feet and one story high. This con- 
tains the laboratories, lecture rooms, and other offices of anatomy and physiology. 
Its floors are impermeable granolithic cement, the walls lined by enameled white 
brick, and the ceilings covered with sheet steel. A second extension from the 
main building is the boiler and engine room, where power is generated for heating, 
ventilation, lighting, and the elevators. 
The surgical operating theater is a separate building in the rear of the main 
building, and is furnished with rooms for forge, instruments, water heater, etc. 
The lighting and equipment and the facilities for demonstration have been 
specially attended to. The general patients’ ward, 100 by 31 feet, is furnished 
with box and other stalls, heating apparatus, baths, and all necessary appliances. 
The floor is of impermeable granolithic cement, and the ceilings of painted sheet 
steel. There is also a fodder room of 20 by 30 feet. The isolation ward, 54 by 15 
feet, has its stalls absolutely separated from one another and each opening by its 
own outer door. It has the usual granolithic floor, with walls of vitrified brick, 
and painted sheet-steel ceilings. The mortuary building has an impermeable floor, 
walls of enameled brick, and painted steel-plate ceilings, and is fitted with every 
convenience for conducting post-mortem examinations and preparing pathological 
specimens. Another building of 51 by 20 feet will be devoted to clinical uses.- 
These, with a cottage for the stud groom, complete the list of State buildings 
erected for veterinary college. The equipment will be made as complete as pos- 
sible for both educational uses and original research. 
The addition to Sage College consists of a main part 40 by 100 feet, and a wing 
88 by 40 feet, four stories high, with walls of brick to correspond with the origi- 
nal building, and slated roofs. The first story is 14 feet high, the second 10, the 
third and fourth each 9. The first story contains a gymnasium 387 by 68 feet, two 
bathrooms, a swimming tank, three dressing rooms, a drying room, the instruct- 
or’s room, an examination room, a waiting room, and a janitor’s room. In the 
second story are ten students’ rooms, a bathroom, a loggia, 10 by 36 feet, opening to 
  
1 Probably this will be more generally understood if called enrollment.
-P-A-G-E-326
  1284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
the east, and a suite of rooms, consisting of parlor, bedroom, and bathroom, for 
guests. The third and fourth stories have each 17 students’ rooms, a bathroom, 
storeroom, and Jinen closets. The rooms are nearly all single, each 10 by 15 feet, 
with closet 24 by 7. They will accommodate 50 persons. There is a staircase in 
a hallway 10 feet wide at the western end where the addition joins the main build- 
ing, and another in the south end of the wing, each 4 feet wide and running from 
the first floor to the fourth. There is a standpipe with 60 feet of 2-inch hose on 
each floor for use in case of fire. The western hallway on each floor is connected. 
by an opening with the main building. All rooms and halls are to be heated by 
steam and lighted by electricity. There is no display of ornament about the 
building, but the materials and workmanship are thoroughly good. Considerable 
alterations, additions, and improvements have also been made in the original 
building. Theroom formerly used as a gymnasium, 25 by 40 feet, is now occupied 
by the kitchen, baking room, pantry, storeroom, and servants’ dining room. 
Above it two stories have been added, containing servants’ bedrooms. The former 
kitchen, pantry, and storeroom have been converted into dining rooms, and in 
the upper stories rooms that were occupied by servants are refitted and prepared 
for use by students. 
[The changes lately made by Cornell University in regard to the degree to be 
hereafter conferred and to the admission requirements are given in another chap- 
ter of this report. ] 
President J. H. Worst, North Dakota Agricultural College: No material changes 
were made during the past year in courses of study or methods of instruction, 
though the largely increased number of students made it necessary to enlarge the 
corps of instruction and to provide additional facilities. 
President James H. Canfield, Ohio State University: The university has been 
divided into six distinct colleges: (1) Agriculture and domestic sciences; (2) arts, 
philosophy, and science; (3) engineering; (4) law; (5) pharmacy; (6) veterinary 
‘medicine. Each college is under its own dean and faculty and has entire control 
of its students and its own affairs. The general faculty considers those matters 
of common interest to all colleges. All preparatory work has been dropped. The 
following new courses have been established: In the college of agriculture and 
domestic science, a full four years’ course and a short two years’ course in domes- 
tic science; in the college of arts, philosophy, and science, a two years’ course 
preparatory to law and journalism; in the college of engineering, a three years’ 
course in architecture and a full four years’ course in ceramics and clayworking; 
in the college of pharmacy, a full four years’ and a short (two years’) course, 
preparing for State examination for registered pharmacist. A new astronomical 
observatory has been erected and equipped by the generosity of Mr. Emerson Mc- 
Millin, of New York City, at an expense of nearly $16,000. The last legislature 
advanced the annual levy from one-twentieth to one-tenth of a mill, and gave the 
university permission to anticipate $200,000 of this levy for the immediate erection 
of much-needed buildings and for additions to equipment. 
President G. E. Morrow, Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College: The 
college has but one regular course of study. This may be classed as an agricul- 
tural or a general science course, with special adaptation to agriculture. This 
course, which requires four years to complete, leads to the degree of bachelor of 
science, and students are admitted to it on passing a satisfactory examination in 
the common-school branches. <A preparatory class is maintained for students not 
fully prepared for the regular course. Two additional instructors have been 
engaged, and for the first time all four of the regular college classes have been 
represented. Considerable additions to the libraries and apparatus for teaching 
science have been made during the year. 
President John M. Bloss, State Agricultural College of Oregon: The methods of
-P-A-G-E-327
  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1285 
instruction have been gradually improved during the past four years by requiring 
more laboratory work in every department and by methods of instruction requir- 
ing original research on the part of the student. These methods are becoming 
more and more characteristic of the institution. A dairy building was erected 
during the year. All students in the agricultural and household economy courses 
are required to take a complete course in the theory of dairying as well as to do _ 
the work in the dairy. The purpose is to encourage farmers to enter into a work 
“new” in Oregon, and thus to add to the prosperity of the State. It is producing 
the result desired. The buildings and outfit cost $750. The new boiler house 
(brick) was made as an addition to the mechanical building; cost, $400. A well 12 
feet in diameter and 36 feet deep was added to our water supply; cost, $550. We 
now have an abundance of water to supply the college plant. 
President George W. Atherton, Pennsylvania State College: With regard to 
the condition of the college during the academic year 1895-96, there is very 
little to say, except that there has been the same regular increase of numbers as 
for several years preceding and a steady and systematic toning up of the work in 
all departments, a more rigid enforcement of the requirements for admission, and, 
in general, a sound and wholesome internal growth. The year has been charac- 
terized, however, by two changes to which we attach very great importance. The 
first is the dropping of the lower class of the preparatory department, so as to 
leave only a single or subfreshman class, the work of which is directed wholly 
with reference to preparation for the freshman class. This has resulted, practi- 
cally, in abolishing the preparatory department as such, and the work of the sub- 
freshman class has been brought into closer correlation with the work of the col- 
lege classes than was previously possible. The second change referred to is the 
organization and grouping of all the work of the college into schools. The grad- 
ual enlargement of the field of instruction covered by the college within the last 
few years has been provided for from time to time by the establishment of addi- 
tional courses of study. By a process of natural growth several of these courses 
have come into close relations with each other and the work of all has been adjusted, 
as far as was practicable, to a common standard. It seemed to the trustees and 
faculty, however, that it would be a decided gain in concentration and effective- 
ness of work if all related subjects and courses were brought together in groups, 
so that all members of a group might give and receive mutual support and stim- 
ulus. Accordingly the following schools were established at the opening of the 
fall session in September, 1895: 
1. A school of agriculture, including technical agriculture, agricultural chemistry, horticul- 
ture, dairying, veterinary science, and such other subjects or departments as may from time to 
time be assigned by the trustees to that school. 
2. A school of natural science, including the departments of botany, chemistry, geology, 
zoology, and kindred branches. 
3. A school of mathematics and physics, including the departments of physics, mathematics, 
and kindred branches. 
4. A school of engineering, including the departments of civil engineering, electrical engineer- 
ing, mechanical engineering, and such other engineering departments as may from time to time 
be established. 
5. A school of mines. 
6. A school of language and literature, including the departments of ancient languages and 
literatures, modern languages and literatures (except English), the English language and liter- 
ature, and such other departments as may from time to time be added. : 
7. A school of history, political science, and philosophy, including the departments of history, 
psychology, ethics and pedagogics, political and economic science, and such other departments 
as may from time to time be added. 
Deans of the several schools were appointed, as follows: Of the school of agriculture, D. H. P. 
Armsby; of the school of natural science, Dr. G. G. Pond; of the school of mathematics and 
physics, Prof. I. T. Osmond; of the school of engineering, Prof. L. E. Reber; of the school of 
mines, Prof. M. C. Ihlseng; of the school of language and literature, Prof. Benjamin Gill; of the 
school of history, political science, and philosophy, the president.

    1286 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
This system has not been long enough in operation with us to justify a conclu- 
sion as to its ultimate results, but there is every reason to believe that they will 
be most wholesome and invigorating to the entire system. Students will obtain 
amore distinct view of the range and relations of their special work. Groups of 
the faculty and instructors will counsel together more freely than is possible 
where each one regards himself merely as an individual member of the teaching 
force, and the board of trustees will be able to gain a more exact knowledge of 
the efficiency and relative importance of the different branches of work by having 
their attention thus fixed on individual groups ey is possible when they are 
required to survey the whole field. 
The schools thus established are not all equally well equipped and manned, but 
the board has made increased provision for the teaching of such general subjects 
as history, language, political science, psychology, and ethics, and has thus done 
much to meet the demands of students who come to us in increasing numbers 
year by year from all sections of the State, desiring to pursue some other than a 
strictly technical course of study. We hope that it will be possible each year to 
offer enlarged facilities for the pursuit of these liberalizing and stimulating stud- 
ies, not merely for the sake of those who choose such lines of work, but for the 
sake of giving to technical students the benefit of doing their special work in the 
midst of such an atmosphere. 
The organization of the college allows a wide range of election by courses and 
schools, but very little by special subjects. If a student wishes to take up elec- 
trical engineering, for example, he finds a course in that subject carefully arranged, 
based on extended inquiry and observation, tested by experience, containing, as 
far as practicable, everything that is essential and nothing unessential, and at 
the same time providing a considerable amount of general and liberalizing studies 
of which every educated man may properly be expected to have at least an ele- 
‘mentary knowledge. He also finds himself, as a member of a school, following his 
special line of work in close and sympathetic relation with fellow-students engaged 
in allied but distinct portions of the same general field, and his conceptions are 
thus made more definite as to the proper limits of his own specialty at the same 
time that they are broadened by association with those who are studying collateral 
branches of the same great department of knowledge. 
It is believed that such a course, systematically pursued, is far more useful to 
the great majority of undergraduate students than any permissible election by 
~ subjects could possibly be. Some cases occur, however, where a student before 
entering college has satisfactorily completed a portion of the prescribed work, or 
where he wishes for particular reasons to specialize in some direction more fully than 
is provided for in the established course. In such cases a selection of some other 
branch of work is allowed, but only on condition that the substitute chosen shall 
be fully equal both in educational and technical value to the subject omitted. 
The course in electrical engineering has been taken merely as an example, the 
same remarks applying to each of the regular courses. 
‘The number of four-year courses now organized is twelve, as follows: 
1. A classical course. 
2. General courses: A general science course, a latin scientific course. 
3. Technical courses: A course in agriculture, a course in biology, a course in chemistry, a 
course in civil‘engineering, a course in electrical engineering, a course in mathematics, a course 
in mechanical engineering, a course in mining engineering, a course in physics. 
Besides these regular courses there are seven short courses—three in agricul- 
ture, one in chemistry, an elementary course in mechanics, and two in mining. 
The increase in the number of students for a few years past, and in the number 
of counties of Pennsylvania represented, shows that the college now, whatever 
may have been true in the past, is meeting the wants and securing the confidence 
of the people of the State. The total attendance has increased from 92 in 1882-83
-P-A-G-E-329
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1287 
to.818 in 1895-96, and the number of counties represented has increased from 22 
to 52. It is believed that no other institution of its kind is doing anything like the 
same extent and range of work on so small resources, and the success of so many 
of our recent graduates in securing responsible and lucrative positions furnishes 
the best possible evidence of its efficiency. 
President J. H. Washburn, Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic 
Arts: The dormitory, which was burned during the year 1894, was replaced and 
several temporary buildings erected. 
President E. B. Craighead, Clemson Agricultural College: There are two 
courses, the agricultural and the mechanical, each requiring four years for com- 
pletion. The aim is to make the work both scientific and practical. Each stu- 
dent is required to work about two hours daily in the chemical laboratory, the 
foundry, the wood shops, the machine shops, at the dairy, in the veterinary depart- 
ment, on the farm, or in the garden—strictly educational work for which the stu- 
dent recieves nopay. The forge and foundry have been enlarged, at a cost of $500; 
the mechanical department has been more fully equipped, at a cost of $8,500; the 
veterinary department, at a cost of $1,300; the mineralogical and geological depart- 
ment, at a cost of $750, and the greenhouse has been enlarged, at a cost of $500. 
President John W. Heston, South Dakota Agricultural College: Our courses of 
study have been thoroughly revised, technical lines have been strengthened, the 
study of the sciences is now begun in the freshman year, and irrigation and agri- 
culture engineering introduced. The sciences in this institution are articulated. 
differently from that obtaining in other scientific institutions, in that we run bot 
any, chemistry, zoology, and physics through a longer period of time. A business 
course has also been introduced, having a duration of two years. 
President Charles W. Dabney, jr., University of Tennessee: The most impor- 
tant improvement in the course of instruction has been the development of the 
work in history and civil government, which has been separated from another 
chair and made an independent subject, in charge for the present of an acting pro- 
fessor. It now requires three years to complete this course, the last two being 
elective. Improvements have also been made in the course of philosophy and 
pedagogics and in those of botany and zoology. Practically a new building has 
been erected upon the site of old North College, using only a portion of its walls 
and floors. This gives the university an elegant dormitory building of forty rooms, 
constructed from the general fund of the university. 
President L. S. Ross, Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas: I am able 
to report favorably of the present condition and hopefully of the future work of 
the college. The liberality of the legislature in appropriating money for improve- 
ments has greatly increased the methods and appointments of the institution. 
The labor fund especially has proven a most wise provision by aiding a considera- 
ble number of deserving young men to pay a large part of their expenses, as well 
as cultivating in them a manly pride and spirit of self-reliance. The course of 
instruction has in some respects been made more flexible and better adapted 
to the wants of students who have a definite object in view and who wish to 
specialize their work in the varied industrial attainments. The large attendance 
at our annual commencement exercises has served to bring the college into closer 
relations with the people of all classes and diffuse a wider knowledge of what is 
being accomplished and the aim and facilities afforded for practical instruction. 
A new infirmary, costing $4,060, has been erected during the year. 
President J. H. Paul; Agricultural College of Utah: I am gratified to say that 
we have had a yery successful year and that the prospects for the ensuing year are 
still more encouraging. The attendance of students for the year was 497, as com- 
pared with 360 for the preceding year. The students were of an average age of 19.7 
years. Seven students were graduated with the degree of bachelor of science, as 
compared with two for the year previous. In general the courses as arranged  
-P-A-G-E-330

last year will be continued, as the results were satisfactory, The legislature has 
dealt generously with the institution, having given to it $23,500 for the single year 
ensuing, as compared with a total of $15,000 for the two preceding years for the 
same purposes, 
President M. H. Buckram, University of Vermont and State Agricultural Col- 
lege: During the year a professorship of physics has been established independ- 
ently of the chair of mathematics, and both elementary and advanced laboratory 
courses provided, for which a new science building, and large gifts for apparatus 
furnish facilities. There has been a continued advancement in the grade of 
students in the agricultural department, placing such students fully on a leyel 
with students in other scientific departments, which has resulted in an increase 
in attendance. The standard in examinations has been raised from 50 to 60 per 
cent in all departments. The Williams Science Hall, the gift of Edwerd H. 
Williams, of Philadelphia, provides lecture rooms, laboratories, and other facili- 
ties for the departments of chemistry, physics, biology, and electricity. The cost 
of this building was $150,000, and of equipping it, including apparatus, $66,000, 
The building has three stories, with basement and attic, has 43,000 square feet of 
available floor space, is built of brick, granite, and terra cotta, and is fireproof. 
There has also been erected the Converse Hall. which is a dormitory. It is 
built of blue marble, containing accommodations for 90 students. It cost $150,000, 
and is the gift of John H. Converse, of Philadelphia. 
President J. M. McBryde, Virginia Polytechnic Institute: The courses of instruc- 
tion of four years each leading to the degree of B.S. are general science, agricul- 
ture, horticulture, applied chemistry, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, 
electrical engineering. There are also two shorter courses of two years each 
called practical agriculture and practical mechanical courses. In every course 
there is work in field, shop, laboratories, and drafting rooms. The policy of 
developing the college as a school of technology has been steadily followed, and 
recently a law was passed adding the words ‘‘ polytechnic institute” to its title, in 
order more clearly to define the character and scope of its work. A separate 
department of civil engineering was established at the beginning of the session. 
The policy of aiding needy students to help them in educating themselves has 
been continued, and nearly 100 were given work to assist them in paying their 
collegiate expenses. During the year 1895-96, 5 graduates and 1 undergraduate 
passed the examination for entrance into the United States Revenue-Cutter Sery- 
ice and others procured positions as chemists, engineers, etc. A new creamery 
and cheese factory has been thoroughly equipped and put into successful opera- 
tion, as also a cider factory and an evaporating plant. The forge and foundry 
have been completely equipped with excellent outfits. A 53-horsepower dynamo 
has been added to the electric department and a new water supply made available 
at a cost of $15,000. A new dormitory accommodating 110 students and a new 
dining and a commencement hall have been completed and equipped. Six resi- 
dences for professors have also been added to our buildings and 654 acres to the 
farm. 
President E, A. Bryan, Agricultural College, Experiment Station, and School 
of Science of the State of Washington: Few changes have been made in the 
_essential features of the courses and methods of instruction during the year end- 
ing June 30, 1896, and these have been largely in the development of the industrial 
side of the education offered. A school of dairying was established in which there 
were enrolled 23 students. These students were for the most part mature men 
and women who had already engaged in the business of dairying. The organiz- 
ing of the short course in agriculture and horticulture, hereafter to be known as 
the school of farming, was completed during the year and gives promise of render- 
ing useful service to that class of students who come from the farm and, after a  
-P-A-G-E-331
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1289 
brief period in school, return to the business of farming. One-half of the instruc- 
tion to these students is laboratory work in agriculture and horticulture. The 
work of the commercial department, including shorthand, typewriting, and book- 
keeping, has been enlarged and that part of the work will hereafter be classified 
as the school of business. The greater portion of the expenditure for this depart- 
ment has been from funds appropriated by the State. Provision has been made 
for a school of pharmacy and a school of veterinary science (the latter to supple- 
ment the work in agriculture) to begin with the beginning of the next college 
year. The courses in civil, mining, and mechanical engineering have proved 
very attractive to large numbers of students. The attendance in all departments 
  has greatly increased during the past year, the increase being between 60 and 70 — 
per cent. The internal development has been entirely satisfactory, and its popu- 
larity throughout the State with all classes of people has increased very materi- 
ally. A dormitory for young women has been erected at a cost of $20,000. This 
isa building composed of two stories besides attic and basement, the extreme 
measurements of which are 100 by 150 feet. 1t is built chiefly of stone and brick. 
A dairy building and equipment have been provided and a piggery has been built, 
costing in all about $4,000. A new heat, light, and power plant has been con- 
structed at a distance of from 800 to 1,200 feet from the buildings and located on 
the Northern Pacific Railway tracks. This plant is intended both for supplying 
heat, light and power, and for purposes of instruction. The building and stack 
are of brick. The total cost is about $15,000. The steam from this plant is con- 
veyed by underground pipes to the larger buildings on the college campus, and 
the electricity for lighting is carried by underground wires to the same build- 
ings. The machinery of the mechanical engineering building is operated by an 
electric motor connected with the plant by underground wires. 
President James L. Goodnight, West Virginia University: The university has 
been organized during the year into colleges, and into schools where not sufficient 
for a college. These are (1) the college of arts and sciences, (2) the agricultural 
college, (8) the engineering college, (4) the law college, (5) the pedagogical school, 
(6) the commercial and business school, (7) the physical-culture school, (8) the 
school of military tactics and science, (9) the preparatory school. The colleges 
are divided up into schools, the schools into departments, when there is any defi- 
nite line of differentiation. During the year there was a gain of 115 in attendance 
over the preceding year, which had the largest attendance that the university had 
had up to that year. 
Dean W. A. Henry, University of Wisconsin: The college of agriculture 
embraces three lines of effort: (1) Experimentation, (2) instructional work at the 
university, (3) instruction to farmers through farmers’ institutes. Though the 
colleges of agriculture and engineering are closely interwoven with the university, 
the funds of each are held distinct. The income of the college of agriculture con- 
sists of (1) one-third of the income from the land grant of 1862, (2) two-fifths of 
the Morrill income, (3) one-third of an increase in changing the State tax for the 
university from one-tenth of a mill to one-eighth of a mill, (4) all sales of farm 
and creamery products, (5) funds appropriated by the legislature from time to 
time, and (6) $12,000 annually for farmers’ institutes. The funds of the college 
of engineering consist of one-third of the income from the land grant of 1862, 
two-fifths of the Morrill income, 1 per cent of all taxes paid to the State by rail- 
way companies, etc., and direct State appropriations. The department of mechanic 
arts is a branch of the college of engineering, and so connected with other engi- 
neering departments that it is impossible to separate the data relating to it. The 
attendance of students in the college of agriculture numbered 190 for the year. 
Most of these were in the dairy course or short course in agriculture. During the 
year there have been sent out from the college of agriculture Farmers’ Institute

    Bulletin No. 9, 820 pages, 50,000 copies; also a Handbook for the Homeseeker, 200 
pages, 100 illustrations, 50,000 copies. This book was prepared by direction of the 
legislature. Both books are distributed gratuitously. From the experiment sta- 
tion there have been issued the Twelfth Annual Report, 350 pages, 15,000 copies, 
and 7 bulletins, aggregating 148 pages, in editions varying from 5,000 to 12,000 
copies each, generally the latter figure. During the past year the college of agri- 
culture has printed and distributed gratuitously to the people of our State 32,468,000 
pages of printed matter. During the past year 107 farmers’ institutes, each last- 
ing two days. have been held, with an aggregate attendance of about 50,000 difter- 
ent persons. 
President A. A. Johnson, University of Wyoming: The College of Agriculture, 
State of Wyoming, was reorganized at the opening of the present university year, 
with additional buildings, laboratories, and instructors, and now offers to the 
youth of Wyoming the following courses of instruction in agriculture, mechanic 
arts, and military science: (1) A one-year course, which is for those whose time 
is limited, but who wish some practical instruction in farming and ranching. 
The studies are so arranged that students from the district schools can enter at 
the beginning of any term. The recitations and lectures are with the regular 
university classes, a certificate is given for work done, and the grades may be 
credited toward the longer courses. The fall term includes bookkeeping or physi- 
ology, drawing, English grammar or rhetoric, arithmetic or algebra, and wood- 
working. The winter term embraces bookkeeping or physical geography, history 
and principles of agriculture, botany or horticulture, arithmetic or algebra, and 
metal working. The spring term is devoted to bookkeeping or civil government, 
the agriculture of soils and tillage, botany or horticulture, zoology or geometry, 
and field and laboratory work. (2) A two-years course, which includes the above 
and selected studies from the second and third years of the complete course. (3) A 
four-years graduating course, which is devoted to a thorough training in agricul- 
ture. (4) A graduate course, which is for graduates who wish to devote their time 
to special research in the fields and laboratories of the Agricultural Experiment 
Station. The chemical laboratory is fitted up with a view to making it as useful 
as possible to the State at large, and good opportunities are offered for carrying 
on special investigations or courses of study. Prospectors who wish to take a 
course in determinative mineralogy, pharmacists who desire to perfect themselves 
in chemistry before taking examinations or going away to a school of pharmacy, 
and especially those contemplating the establishment of some industry developing 
the natural resources of Wyoming,-will be given every available facility for their 
work. The study being individual and not in classes, hours can generally be 
arranged to suit the student. The only requirement is sufficient previous knowl- 
edge to undertake the line of work desired. Tuition is free; apparatus broken and 
chemicals used are charged at cost. 
President H. A. Hill, Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical 
College: Practical agriculture in the fields or practical mechanics in the shops is 
compulsory with all males over 14 years of age, and optional with males 12 to 14 
years of age; but with females it is as yet optional. Theoretical agriculture and 
mechanics are begun earlier, when possible, in a primary way, and followed by 
higher works. The other subjects specified by the act of Congress of 1890 are 
taught to the whole school. The principal departments of the university are 
the literary, the scientific, the agricultural and mechanical, and the normal. 
President Inman E. Page, Lincoln Institute: For several successive years it has 
been necessary to report that though the regents were able to employ competent 
persons to teach the mechanic arts, they were not able for want of funds to employ 
a suitable person to teach agriculture. I am glad to report that the legislature 
has made a small appropriation for instruction in agriculture, which hereafter

will be a part of the curriculum of this institution. A new main building, costing 
$40,000, has just been completed to furnish the facilities of the building destroyed 
by fire in 1894.

Trade Schools, Hampton Normal Schools and Agricultural Institute, Hampton Va., to be dedi- 
eated November 19, 1896. 
Institute: Special attention has been given to the further development and improve- 
ment of the department of agriculture. The farm and buildings have been placed 
in the best'condition. Instruction has been given in the principles of agriculture, 
chemistry, biology, and mineralogy, accompanied with lectures. Practical appli-
-P-A-G-E-334

cations of the principles taught have been made so far as the funds and equipment 
of the institution would warrant. The institution has been especially successful 
in the development of the mechanical department. The principal industries are 
woodworking, ironworking, masonry, house painting, printing, and the domestic 
arts. The principles of trades are taught without any attempt to manufacture 
articles for the market, and such instruction has been given as students are most 
likely to need after leaving the institution. 
Principal H. B. Frissell, Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute: The 
school has increased the work done for the students in the line of agriculture the 
past year. More ground has been added for the experiment station, and 12 acres 
are now employed in this way. Trees and shrubs have been planted for the pur- 
pose of showing what can be done in the raising of fruit. Regular instruction in 
agriculture is now given to every class in school, besides that given in the regu- 
lar agricultural department. Variety and culture tests have been made, chiefly 
of sweet and Irish potatoes. Tests are being made of different methods of the 
preparation of the soil and of after cultivation of crops. The effect of fertilizers 
on soil and crop is being tested. A continuous test of our dairy herd is being 
made by the Babcock method. In addition to the manual training which is car- 
ried on in connection with the academic work of the school and the trade teaching 
in the sixteen shops, a building is in process of erection on the school grounds, to 
cost $40,000, to be known as the Armstrong and Slater Memorial Trade School 
Building, where a larger number of students can be taught trades than heretofore, 
and better work done. Itis the design to allow only those to enter this school 
who have finished the academic course of the school. The work carried on will 
be more productive, and the sixteen shops already in operation will give to the 
graduates from this trade school an opportunity to put into actual operation the 
lessons they have learned. With the manual training continued through the 
entire academic course, the trade school following, and the productive industries 
of the school, it is hoped that well-trained mechanics may be sent out. 
President J. H. Hill, West Virginia Colored Institute: Though our curriculum 
is that prescribed by the State for the normal schools, we shall organize during 
the coming year (1896-97) an academic course based upon the natural sciences, 
having in view the establishment of a pure agricultural course. During the year 
there has been completed a large two-story building 43 by 82 feet, at a cost of $8,000, 
which is to be used for a machinery hall.

    CHAPTER XXVIII. 
THE BERTILLON SYSTEM AS A MEANS OF SUPPRESSING 
THE BUSINESS OF LIVING BY CRIME.! 
Movement of crime in 1870; Ways in which crime as a business may be suppressed; 
Pauperism, its character and suppression; Efforts to prevent vagabondage in 
England three hundred years before the introduction of the instruction of the 
peasantry; Failure of such legislation to accomplish its object; Comparison of 
the number of paupers in American almshouses with the number of prisoners in 
penitentiaries; The prevention of the education of youth in crime; The refor- 
mation of the criminal; The philosophy of the Bertillon system of identifying 
habitual criminals; The superiority of the system to photographic records in 
point of classification; Method of classification used in France; Accuracy of 
the system; The system in the United States; The text of State laws in regard 
to the system and illustrations of the apparatus tt employs. 
The number of prisoners in the United States in the year 1870 differed in a very 
marked way from the number reported in 1860. In 1870 the city States of Massa- 
chnsetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York had far fewer prisoners in 
their custody than they had in 1860, while the agricultural States of Ohio, Indiana, ~ 
Illinois, Kentucky, Iowa, and Kansas very largely or even enormously increased 
the inmates of their prisoris at the close of the sixties. How far the civil war 
drew off the criminal element of the Northeastern cities and how far that element 
reappeared, if at all, in the prisons of the West after the disbanding of the armies, 
is a question that must be left to conjecture. 
The deficit of criminal prisoners in the Northeastern States at the date of 1870 
did not last long. Twenty years more than removed it. In the nonslaveholding 
States of the West the increase was also marked, though by no means so alarming 
as that following the close of the civil war. This constant increment to the class 
of persons called by the census ‘‘prisoners,” and the ease with which a jackknife, 
or a mouthful of liquor will secure transportation for such persons, when free, 
over the many lines of railways that traverse the Republic, make it necessary that 
the police of towns and cities should not be left isolatedly to prove before judges 
and juries, properly anxious to be just and merciful, the mischievous disposition 
of their unwelcome visitors. 
There are three ways in which crime as a business may be more or less under- 
mined: (1) By preventing the education of youth in crime; (2) by reforming the 
incarcerated criminal; (3) by so registering the criminal that he will fear to prac- 
tice his vocation, knowing that if captured his lawyer will have some difficulty in 
explaining away the facts registered against him. The first and second methods 
have long been tried in this country, and now a plan known as the Bertillon sys- 
tem of identifying habitual criminals is popmmoney as ea of tee ee the

captured criminal far more permanently than is done by photography. It is the 
object of this chapter, after recalling some elementary facts in regard to pau- 
perism and reformation, to place the claims and mechanism of the scheme of 
M. Bertillon before the public. 
PAUPERISM. 
The word pauperism is here charged with a definite meaning. A pauper is one 
living upon public taxes. Universal poverty and much starvation may arise even 
in agricultural communities from the disease of a crop, as in Ireland in 1845, or 
from periodical drought, as in India, or from unmerciful taxation, asin the ‘age of 
Louis XIV,” when the peasantry were compelled to starve themselves for fear of 
quickening the inventive powers of the taxgatherer to create new forms of exac- 
tion. But the impounding the poor at the expense of the parish—the creation of 
a legal poor—is due to the poor laws of England, which have steadily elevated the 
cost of keeping the claimants for charity from $3,500,000 in 1750 to $40,000,000 in 
1885, or about $50 for each of the 800,000 paupers in England and Wales. If this 
burden had been equally distributed, the amount paid by each person of the popu- 
lation would have been nearly $1.75 in 1885, though but 55 cents in 1750. Yet the 
original motive of this effort to ‘‘relieve the poor” was not philanthropy. Eng- 
land was swarming with yagabonds, beggars, or tramps, and to relieve the appre- 
hensions of the stationary and self-supporting part of the population a series of 
coercive acts was passed during the reign of the family of Tudor compared to 
which the late compulsory school laws of our Eastern States in that particular 
are child’s play. The preamble of the act of 1576 is expressed in these terms: 
To the intent that youth may be accustomed and brought up to labor, and then not like to 
grow up to be idle rogues, and to the intent also that such as be already grown up in idleness 
and are such rogues at this present may not have any just excuse in saying that they can not 
get any service or work, and that other poor and needy persons being willing to labor may be 
set to work, be it enacted, etc. 
In the United States there were in 1890 73,045 paupers in almshouses, of whom 
86,656 were native-born whites, 6,467 colored persons, and 27,648 were white for- 
eigners. As the increase of criminals in the United States has been connected in 
one way or another with a public education which ‘‘ permits children to grow up 
without a means of earning a living,” it is proper to ask whether the growth of 
paupers in almshouses is proportional to the growth of criminals in prisons. 
Comparison. 
(1) WITHOUT REGARD TO INCREASE IN POPULATION.

aNot including outdoor paupers for any year except perhaps in 1870, just before which date 
the State board of charities of Massachusetts recommended that that State ought not to estab- 
lish any more almshouses, but should eke out private and municipal charities. 
It is quite as logical to ascribe the great diminution in the number of paupers 
shown in this comparison to the influence of the public schools as to ascribe the 
smaller increase in the number of criminals to that cause. Both sets of figures 
are published in the last census, and therefore one set is as good as the other. But

  THE BERTILLON SYSTEM OF IDENTIFYING CRIMINALS. 1301 
outside of any statistical statement, how it is possible to reconcile any connection 
of education with increase in vagabondage and criminality if in times when even 
members of the English House of Lords could not read it was found necessary to 
establish an apprenticeship system and to employ the whipping post, stocks, and 
hanging to make people work? “ By the act of 1536,” says Mr. Froude in his His- 
tory of England, “the ‘sturdy (able-bodied) vagabond’ who by the earlier statute 
was condemned on his second ‘offense to lose the whole or a part of his right ear, 
was condemned for the third offense to be executed as an enemy to the common- 
wealth.” ‘A further excellent but severe enactment,” continues Mr. Froude, 
“empowered the parish officers to take up all idle children above the age of 5 and 
‘appoint them to masters of husbandry or other craft or labor to be taught,’ and 
if such child ran away, he might be publicly whipped with rods.”! ‘‘ This edu- 
cative theory,” Mr. Froude says, ‘‘ was simple but effective, for the first condition 
of a worthy life is the ability to maintain it in independence,” and though ‘‘ varie- 
ties of inapplicable knowledge may be good, they are not essential.” Under such 
arégime it might be supposed that vagabonds would have soon disappeared cen- 
turies before any variety of inapplicable knowledge was taught to the peasantry 
of England; but such was not the case, for after some forty years of this species of 
effective education it was necessary to pass the statute of 1576, the preamble of 
which has been quoted above, and in 1601 the famous statute out of which, says 
Dr. Burn, the historian of the ‘poor laws,” ‘‘have come more litigation and a 
greater amount of revenue, with consequences more extensive and more serious 
in their aspect than ever were identified with any other act of Parliament or sys- 
tem of legislation whatever.” The first Tudor set property to supporting the 
Government, the last set property to pauperizing the poor, though intending to 
make them industrious. 
THE PREVENTION OF THE EDUCATION OF YOUTH IN CRIME, 
The bad policy of confining children arrested for some trivial offense with the 
criminals of a common prison early caused separate establishments to be created 
for ‘‘juvenile offenders.” These establishments are variously called houses of 
refuge, reformatories, and industrial schools, and there are one or more of them 
for each sex in most of the States. In 1890 there were 14,846 inmates in these 
institutions, one-fifth of whom were girls. In 1880 the inmates were 11,468, or 
229 persons in every 1,000,000 inhabitants, to 237 persons in the year 1890. Far 
the larger number of these 15,000 boys or girls are not criminals; many of them 
are vicious, but very many more are victimsof an environment neither created 
nor improvable by any exertions of theirs. To these the State holds out a helping 
hand, and every decade sees an improvement in the methods and character of its 
management. To children who have done no illegal act, but have neither parents 
nor friends, a thousand orphan asylums open their doors. 
THE REFORMATION OF THE CRIMINAL, 
In America, if not in the world, the earliest efforts to free the slave and reform 
the criminal were made by the Quakers of Pennsylvania. They were the first 
abolitionists, when abolition was opposed to their business interests; and they 
devised a scheme for reforming the criminal that was so terribly effective in theory 
as frequently in operation to unsettle the mind of the patient or drive him to self- 
destruction. Their system of prison régime was known to French and English 
investigators as the solitary-confinement plan, according to which reflection was 
only broken by religious instruction. But this early and successful effort to add 
a crowning terror to crime has long since passed out of existence, and during the 
1Froude’s History (of the Tudors) of England, Vol.1, pp. 59, 88, and in fact the whole chapter.

last ten years another system, unique in its philosophy and social in its mechanism, 
has been introduced. This innovation is the Elmira plan, in which the household 
economy of the prison and the physical, moral, and intellectual instruction are 
conducted on a regenerative method. Into such prison it is even ventured to 
introduce the word honor, and prisoners are regularly dismissed on parole when 
they have learned a trade or are capable of taking care of themselves in a legiti- 
mate manner. 
In these ways has society endeavored mercifully to exterminate crime as a busi- 
ness; that is to say, to exterminate the hardened or habitual criminal. Against 
those, however, who are recalcitrant to such treatment energetic measures are being 
taken, and all that has been wanting to effect the object contemplated by those 
measures is a method of identifying the confirmed criminal. 
THE BERTILLON SYSTEM OF ANTHROPOMETRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 
The habitual criminal who successfully practices his vocation is characterized 
by two mental qualities—egotism and cunning. He looks upon himself as an 
educated man in the sense that Mr. Froude, the historian, uses the word “‘educa- 
tion,” and probably disdains every ‘‘ variety of inapplicable knowledge.” He con- 
siders his professional adventures as in no way differing from any other business, 
except that his requires courage; and he receives complacently the homage of his 
fellows and the admiration of the crowd that fears the law which he despises. 
It requires some ability to apprehend an artist of this description, enterprising 
not only asan individual marauder, but still more formidable as a teacher of his 
specialty. At first the idea was to ‘‘set a thief to catch a thief,” and then police 
agents were expected to ‘“‘impregnate their visual memory with the cast of the 
criminal’s countenance,” for ‘‘ the eye sees in things only what it looks at in them 
and it looks only at that of which the idea is already present in the mind.”! But 
both of these methods have drawbacks. Judges and juries are averse to paying 
off the ‘‘ old scores” of one person against another, and are aware that the eye may 
see in things what is not there. Photography was thought capable of obviating 
this difficulty, but the collection of criminal portraits has become so large that it 
is a physical impossibility to discover the portrait of a recaptured criminal unless 
he kindly tells the name he bore when the portrait was taken. Thus, because it 
was impossible to identify an arrested person with his past, and punish him 
accordingly, justice has been baffled and roguery nourished. 
The use of anthropometry as a method of identification, ve M. Bertillon, 
chief of the central bureau of identification of France since 1882,? rests upon the 
three following data, which the experience of the ten years acy past has shown 
to be unimpeachable, to wit: 
1. The almost absolute immutability of the human frame after the twentieth 
year of age. The height only, or to be more exact, the thigh bone, often con- 
tinues to grow for two or three years longer, but so little that it is easy to make 
allowance for it. Experience shows that this small increase ismore than compen- 
sated for by the curving of the vertebral column (indicated on the descriptive card 
of the criminal by curve), which, commencing about the twentieth year, con- 
tinues to accentuate itself by degrees until old age. 
2. The extreme diversity of dimension which the human skeleton presents when 
compared in different subjects. This occurs to such an extent that it would be 
difficult, if not impossible, to find two individuals whose bony structure is, we

System of Identification, the Werner Company, edited by Maj. R. W. McClaughry.

and is richly illustrated, mostly by photogravures, with the view of defining terms used in 
describing the genetic peculiarities of the human face and head.

will not say exactly identical, but even sufficiently alike to make any confusion 
between them possible, 
8. The facility and comparative precision with which certain dimensions of the 
skeleton may be measured in the living subject by means of calipers of very 
simple construction. And from among the innumerable measurements that it is 
possible to take of. the human body, those to which we have, after minute criti- 
cism, given preference are as follows: 
(The instruments used and the manner of taking these measurements are shown in Note A of 
the appendix to this chapter.)

aNow given place to width across face between cheek bones. 
But every card made is as cumbersome as a photograph, and the measurements, 
however scientifically made, are valueless-for use unless classified. M. Bertillon 
reports his method to be as follows: During ten years 120,000 persons passed 
through the prisons of Paris, and their anthropometrical description (or signalment, 
as the French call it) were inscribed on as many slips of cardboard measuring 5.7 
inches in length by 5.5 inches in width. These are assorted as they accumulate in 
this way: The cards for women (one-fifth of the whole) are placed by themselves; 
then the cards for male-persons under 21 years of age are separated (one-tenth of 
the whole number of cards for that sex). The cards remaining (90,000) are first 
broken up into three divisions, according to the length of the head, to wit: First 
division, short lengths of head; second division, medium lengths of head; third 
division, long lengths of head. 
The meaning of the terms are rigorously defined by figures, but those figures 
are not an abstract definition of the terms short, medium, and long length of head, 
but they are fixed in such a way as to make one-third of the cards fall in each 
division. Thus the medium length of the Parisian police department has a range 
of only 6 mm. (185-190 mm.), while the long length includes all over 190 mm. 
and the short length all under 185mm. This artificial interpretation of the terms 
long, medium, and short lengths has been adopted because experience has justified 
it. It must not be forgotten, however, that the measurements inscribed on the 
card are scientifically true,even though the cards be assorted into groups having 
arbitrary limits. 
Having divided the cards into three groups by the length of the head, each group 
is subdivided into three groups by the width of the head—narrow, medium, and 
broad widths. Thus three sets are subdivided into nine. Each of these nine 
groups is subdivided into three groups by the length of the middle finger—small, 
medium, large; each of these twenty-seven groups is subdivided on the length of 
the forearm; each of these groups into three by the height; these into classes of 
sixty by the little finger, and finally the color of the eye forms a group of twelve. 
out of a total of 90,000 cards. 
The method of identification is obvious. A suspected person is arrested at Chi- 
cago. He denies everything, of course, and claims he is more sinned against by 
society than sinning. His anthropometric measurement is telegraphed, let us say, 
to Washington to a central bureau or library of the descriptions of criminals, at 
which all measurements have accumulated. The investigation proceeds from the 
identification of the length of the head to its width, from that to the length of 
the middle finger, from that to the foot, ete. Sometimes the measurement of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
1304 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
length of the head falls on the limit of a subdivision, then a double search is 
required, ‘‘exactly as one looks in two places for a word that one does not know 
the spelling of.” In this double search resides, it is said, the only difficulty of 
identification; but the results obtained in ten years of practice in France have 
demonstrated that this obstacle is very easily overcome. There are, nevertheless, 
some objections to the accuracy of the measurements in the way of finding “the 
equation of personal error” of the observer, as is said in astronomy, or as M. Ber- 
tillon calls it, ‘maximum of tolerable deviation,” that can not be discussed here, 
but are fully treated in M. Bertillon’s work, of which there are two translations 
before the American public.! 
At the prefecture of police the measurements are taken and classified by special 
employees. All the subjects arrested during the day are measured and identified, 
each new card being made in duplicate at one writing. The copy is immediately 
classified in the anthropometrical file, while the original card is classified alpha- 
betically according to the orthography (or, more exactly, according to the pronun- 
ciation) of the proper name as declared by the prisoner. The card put in the 
anthropometric file is slightly shorter than the one placed in the alphabetic file, so 
asto preventconfusion. This alphabetic file is indispensable to discovering acrim- 
inal at large, for when the criminal’s name is known, the alphabetic card contains 
a description of any peculiar marks upon his person, which, it is unnecessary to 
say, are not ascertainable except when the name of the suspected person is the 
same as given by him when his card was made. 
A singular feature of the operation of the Parisian system is that it has caused 
amarked decrease in the number of ‘‘ international thieves ” of the pickpocket class. 
It was the rule, says Bertillon, for individuals of this class to give a new name on 
each arrest, but recognizing the impossibility of concealing their identity, they 
have admitted personally that they prefer to remain in foreign capitals. In 1885 
there were 65 arrested; in 1886, 52; then 39, then 19, and finally, in 1890, 14. Indeed, 
this method is particularly valuable for the purpose of identifying foreign thieves, 
as among 15 French recidivists there will be only 1 giving a false name, while in 
the case of the foreigner 1 in 3 is the proportion. 
The probability of recognizing the criminal by the measurements, says M. Ber- 
tillon, is equivalent to certainty, as the statistics of Paris show. 
THE GRADUAL ADOPTION OF THE BERTILLON SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES. 
The Bertillon or ‘‘ French” system of measuring persons convicted or arrested 
for crime, in order more surely to identify such persons (if rearrested) as habitual 
criminals or recidivists, has gone through three phases of development in the 
United States, as far as State legislatures have dealt with the subject. In the 
case of the State of Pennsylvania, for which a law was passed in 1889, the use of 
the Bertillon system in her State and local prisons was permitted, but neither 
required nor recommended (Note B). In the case of the State of Massachusetts, 
for which a law was passed in 1890, the use of the Bertillon system was required 
in her prisons, jails, and houses of correction (certain prisoners excepted), but 
she failed to establish a central bureau for the custody and classification of the 
cards containing the measurements (Note C). In the case of the State of New 
York, the law lately passed (Note D) has not only required the use of the Bertil- 
lon system in her State prisons, but has established the central bureau so neces- 
sary to the efficiency of that system. The management of each of the prisons of 
Illinois has introduced the system of M. Bertillon, as has also the management of

the Detroit House of Correction. . The governing board of the Ohio State Peniten- 
tiary has readopted the Bertillon system after an interval of suspension of six 
years, and this Bureau is informed by the warden of the Colorado State Peniten- 
tiary that the commissioners of that institution have ‘‘ about concluded to adopt 
it in the near future.” Finally, from Dr. Paul R. Brown, major and surgeon, 
United States Army, information is received that he has a ‘“ Bertillon” plant in 
his hospital at Fort Hamilton, New York Harbor, and that he hopes to be success- 
ful in persuading the military authorities of the United States to supersede by the 
Bertillon system the outline-card system now used to identify deserting or dis- 
honorably discharged soldiers from the United States Army. 
Though the institutions directly or indirectly referred to above (the prisons of 
Pennsylvania excepted) have their records made according to the Bertillon system 
of anthropometric measurements, our nearest approach to a trial of the other great 
essential of the system, that is to say, its cooperative feature, is the tentative effort 
made by the Chicago police bureau, at the request of the Police Chiefs’ Associa- 
tion of the United States and Canada, at a meeting held in the city of Chicago 
during 1893. The police department of Chicago was selected on account: of its 
having had since 1888 a ‘‘ bureau of identification” operated on M. Bertillon’s sys- 
tem. The result of this experiment is thus described by Major McClaughry, 
general superintendent of the Pontiac (Ill.) State Reformatory: 
‘In 1890 (1888, according to Superintendent Badenoch) a bureau of identifica- 
* tion was established in Chicago in connection with the police department of that 
city. Officers were sent out and many thousand descriptions (not necessarily after 
the Bertillon system) of habitual criminals were obtained from the different pris- 
ons and police departments of the United States, which were classified in said 
bureau during the World’s Fair, for which the city was then preparing. Its 
value was thoroughly demonstrated during the fair, when Chicago was visited by 
many professional and habitual criminals from different parts of the country 
whose descriptions had been obtained.” 
At present the cities of Cincinnati, State of Ohio; Detroit, State of Michigan; 
Philadelphia, State of Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, State of Wisconsin; Elgin, State 
of Illinois, and Washington, in the District of Columbia, ‘‘frequently send a 
description (after the Bertillon system) to the Chicago bureau.” It is expected 
that the city of New York will soon be added to the list, and probably the cities 
of Pittsburg, State of Pennsylvania, and Omaha, State of Nebraska. These cities 
will complete the list as far as known. 
The value of the measurements and the necessity of a national central bureau 
in this country are readily inferred from the statement by Superintendent of 
Police Deitsch, of Cincinnati, made in a communication to this Bureau, which 
reads as follows: 
“The malefactors of a city where this (the Bertillon) system is in use are the 
first to realize the impossibility of escaping its records, and as it is but logical to 
assume that no more powerful motive exists in human nature for not committing 
a crime than the assurance that one will be recognized and that punishment will 
follow, the criminal naturally seeks other territory. He fears the measurement. 
Since this service was inaugurated here in 1891, upward of 400 criminals have 
been recognized by means of it, and over 100 of the habitual and persistent offend- 
ers have been deported for long terms under our ‘habitual criminal laws.’ Many 
have left for other parts.” 
The Bertillon system has filled a want long felt by prison wardens and superin- 
tendents. As early as 1879 or 1880 the wardens of ten prisons made an arrangement 
among themselves to cooperate in registering facts calculated toserve in identifying 
habitual criminals, and each sent a representative to the penitentiary at Joliet 
to attend the school of instruction established in that prison. This system failed,  
-P-A-G-E-348
  1306 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
it is said, from extraneous causes; but the organization of the Prison Wardens’ 
Association in 1887 for the identification of criminals led naturally to the indorse- 
ment given by that association in 1888, and again in 1891, and in 1894, of the Ber- 
tillon system, which possessed two great elements of vitality, that is to’say, scien- 
tific accuracy in identification and methodical cooperation through a central 
bureau having the custody and classification of the cards containing the measure- 
ments. This central bureau is thought to be absolutely necessary to secure the 
highest results of which the Bertillon system is capable, but its establishment in 
this country, composed as it is of forty-five judicial systems which are independ- 
ent of the Federal system, except upon constitutional questions, has to contend 
with difficulties not felt in a centralized government or in one of the States of the 
Federal Union. It should be remarked also, in passing, that Canadian prison and 
police authorities are cooperating with those within our borders in urging the 
establishment of a central office, as the common language of both countries 
remoyes a valuable though superficial means of identifying habitual criminals 
who wish to hide their antecedents by assuming an air of innocence or misfortune 
or are wholly noncommittal. 
Though the wardens and superintendents have inaugurated the system in this 
country, a review of the information before the Bureau suggests the fact that the 
police departments are particularly active in advocating its adoption and in em- 
ploying it. In 1893 it was adopted in Chicago at the suggestion of the Police 
Association, and the same association at its meeting at Atlanta during the month 
of May, 1896, urged the adoption and took measures looking to the immediate 
~ establishment of a central bureau at the national capital, either by means of such 
aid as Congress might grant or through the cooperation of the police department 
of the various cities. The law of Massachusetts (Note B) confines the measure- 
ments to convicts probably under three years’ sentence, but the police department 
deals with a larger class, the, so to speak, possibly habitual criminal. Thus, in 
Philadelphia, of 531 persons arrested in 1894 by the detective force, 292, or 55 per 
cent, were measured by the Bertillon system, 47 of the 292 being accused of com- 
mitting burglary, 91 larceny, and 24 picking pockets. Superintendent of Police 
Linden quotes from the report of the department of public safety of Philadelphia, 
as follows: ‘The usefulness of the work from a police standpoint is evidenced by 
the number of requests we have had from other cities for accurate measure- 
ments and photographs of men apprehended in those cities and thought to have 
been in custody here.” And in his letter adds: ‘‘Our Bertillon measurements 
have aided the service very much in determining who the prisoners are, and have 
aided others in the same way.” 
Reference has been made to the system of identification adopted about 1879 or 
1880 by ten institutions situated in the contiguous States of Mlinois, Michigan, 
Wisconsin, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. It will be seen 
that this system is a method of registration based on photography, a few physical 
and many social facts (Note E). This method, though found competent to 
answer the demands made upon it, will probably give way to the higher accuracy 
of a system based upon what are said to be constants in the physical stature of 
each individual, and thus serve to identify professional criminals, who ever desire 
to be considered “first offenders,” for reasons given by Superintendent Deitsch, 
who remarks: 
“In many States and cities laws have been passed which are known as ‘habitual 
criminal acts’ (see Note F), increasing the punishment of recidivous characters, 
which have made the success or failure of these attempts more and more impor- 
tant to the criminal class. This has correspondingly increased the interest and 
importance of the identification branch of police departments.”

The subject, barefooted, is placed with his back to the wall, his vertical column about 15 centi- 
meters to the left of the scale. The more rapidly the operation is performed the more accurate 
it will be. 
The reach, or length of the arms extended in the shape of a cross, is taken immediately after- 
wards, almost without moving the subject, by means of a scale on the wall, the vertical lines of 
which scale are adapted to all heights. 
The-measurement of the height of the trunk (see fig. 3) is then effected by the aid of instru- 
ments analogous to those employed for the full height. 
The two cranial diameters (length and width of skull) are both maximum dimensions. They 
should be taken by means of a special compass, commonly called a * caliper compass” (see special 
illustration). The length of the head is measured from the hollow at the root of the nose, taken 
as the fixed point, to the most prominent part of the back of the head (see fig. 4). The meas- 
urement of the width of the head is a somewhat more delicate operation. It differs principally 
from the other head measurement in that there is no fixed point, and that the extremities of the 
two branches of the instrument should in this case be removed together horizontally and sym- 
metrically from each side of the head. Both of these head measurements must be verified by 
fixing the compasses at the distance recorded and then applying them to the head for verifica- 
tion of the record. 
‘The two diameters of the right ear (fig. 6) are measured on their maximum axis by means of 
asmall caliper rule of special make, taking care not to depress in any manner the soft parts of 
the ear. 
The naked left foot should be measured after the whole weight of the body has been thrown 
upon it, as shown in Fig. 7, the stem of the large caliper rule being applied on the side next the 
great toe, as the aim is not to make a shoe for the foot but to get its measure so exactly that a 
shoe made on such measurements could not be worn. 
The middie and little fingers of the left hand are measured at right angles from the joint at 
the back of the hand by means of the caliper rule (fig. 8). 
The left forearm is measured from the point of the elbow to the extremity of the middle 
finger, the forearm being bent at an acute angle with the arm above the elbow and the hand 
extended flat upon the table, nails upward (fig. 9).

WHAT KNOWLEDGE IS OF MOST WORTH?! 
By NicHoLtas MuRRAY BUTLER, 
Professor of Philosophy and Education in Columbia University. 
The student of history is struck with the complexity of modern thought. From 
the dawn of philosophy to the great revival of learning, the lines of development 
are comparatively simple and direct. During that period one may trace, step by 
step, the evolution of the main problems of thought and action, and discover 
readily how the theories of the seers stood the test of application by the men of 
deeds. At Athens during the great fifth century the inner life was the chief part 
of life itself. In that age of the world life was simple; and often, because of its 
refinement and independence, more reflective than with us. Men’s ideals were 
more sharply defined and more easily realizable. They did not doubt that the 
world existed for them and their enjoyment. Even that advanced stage of human 
culture of which Dante is the immortal exponent believed, as Mr. John Fiske 
says,’ that ‘‘ this earth, the fair home of man, was placed in the center of a uni- 
verse wherein all things were ordained for his sole behoof: the sun to give him 
light and warmth, the stars in their courses to preside over his strangely check- 
ered destinies, the winds to blow, the floods to rise, or the fiend of pestilence to 
stalk abroad over the land—all for the blessing, or the warning, or the chiding, of 
the chief among God’s creatures, man.” With such a conception as this, theory 
and practice could be closely related. In the ancient world it was not unusual to 
find the thought of the disciple guided implicitly by the maxim of the master. 
Pv@8u Geavrov and Nil admirari were preached by the early philosophers in the * 
confident belief that they could be practiced by him who would. 
In these modern days all this is changed. Man has come to doubt not only his 
supremacy in the universe, but even his importance. He finds that, far from 
dwelling at the center of things, he is but ‘‘the denizen of an obscure and tiny 
speck of cosmical matter, quite invisible amid the innumerable throng of flaming 
suns that make up our galaxy.” A host of new knowledges has appealed to human 
sympathy and interest, and has taxed them to the utmost. Galileo with his tele- 
scope has revealed to us the infinitely great, and the compound microscope of 
Jansen has created, as out of nothing, the world of the infinitely small. Within

a generation or two biology has been created, and physics, chemistry, and geology 
have been born again. The first wave of astonishment and delight at these great 
revelations has been succeeded by one of perplexity and doubt in the presence of 
the wholly new problems that they raise. The old self-assurance is lost. Men 
first stumble, blinded by the new and unaccustomed light, and then despair. The 
age of the faith and assured conviction of Aquinas was followed by the bold and 
cynical skepticism of Montaigne; and this in turn—for skepticism has never 
afforded a resting place for the human spirit for more than a moment—has yielded. 
to the philosophy of disenchantment and despair of a Schopenhauer and the mor- 
bidly acute and unsatisfying self-analysis of an Amiel. Already it is proclaimed 
by Nordau and his school that we are in an age of decadence, and that many of 
our contemporary interpreters of life and thought—Wagner, Tolstoi, Ibsen, Zola, 
the pre-Raphaelites—are fit subjects for an insane asylum. Mankind is divided 
into warring camps, and while electricity and steam have bound the nations of 
the earth together, questions of knowledge and of belief have split up every nation 
into sects. From all this tumult it is difficult to catch the sound of the dominant 
note. Each suggested interpretation seems to lead us further into the tangled 
maze, where we can not see the wood for the trees. Standards of truth are more 
definite than ever before, but standards of worth are strangely confused, and at 
times even their existence is denied. 
Amid all this confusion, however, a light has been growing steadily brighter 
for those who have eyes to see. In our own century two great masters of thought 
have come forward, offering, like Ariadne of old, to place in our-hands the guid- 
ing thread that shall lead us through the labyrinth—the German, Hegel, and the 
Englishman, Herbert Spencer. And as the century closes, amid the din of other and 
lesser voices, we seem to hear the deeper tones of these two interpreters swelling 
forth as representative of the best and most earnest endeavors, from two totally 
different points of view of our human seekers after light. Each has taken the 
whole of knowledge for his province, each has spread out before us a connected 
view of man and his environment, and each would 
Assert Eternal Providence 
And justify the ways of God to men. 
These great teachers typify the catholicity and the scientific method that are so 
characteristic of the best expressions of our modern civilization. Whatever of 
insight we have gained into history, into philosophy, into art, and into nature 
they have incorporated in their systematic thinking and have endeavored to illu- 
mine with the light of their controlling principles. Hegel, schooled in the teach- 
ings of Kant and Fichte, and coming early to an appreciation of the seed thought 
of Platoand Aristotle, Bruno and Spinoza, has taught usin unmistakable language 
that independent, self-active being is the father of all things. Spencer, feeling 
the thrill of that unity which makes the cosmos one, and receiving from Lamarck 
and Von Baer the hint thatled him to see that the life of the individual furnishes 
the clew to the understanding of the life of the aggregate, whether natural or 
social, has formulated into a single and irrefutable law of progress the terms of 
that development or evolution which has been more or less dimly before the mind 
of man since thought began. The German, with his principle of self-activity, 
and the Englishman, with his law of evolution, offer us a foothold for our knowl- 
edge and our faith, and assure us that it will safely support them. From the one 
we learn the eternal reasonableness of all that is or can be, while the other teaches 
us the character of the process by which the visible universe, that every day pre- 
sents new wonders to our gaze, has been builded out of the primeval star dust. At 
their hands the two sublime and awe-inspiring verities of, Kant—-the starry heay- 
ens above and the moral law within—find their places in the life of the spirit, and 
together testify to its eternity and its beauty.

WHAT KNOWLEDGE IS OF MOST WORTH? * ASSES. 
Despite the fact that our age is one of unexampled scientific and industrial prog- 
ress, yet nothing in all our modern scientific activity is more striking than the 
undisputed primacy of thought—thought not in antagonism to sense, but inter- 
pretative of the data of sense. Idealism, shorn of its crudities and its extrava- 
gances, and based on reason rather than on Berkeley’s analysis of sense perception, 
is conquering the world. What Plato saw, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, and Hegel 
have demonstrated. The once dreaded materialism has lost all its terrors. 
Science itself has analyzed matter into an aggregate of dynamical systems, and 
speaks of energy in terms of will. The seemingly inert stone that we grasp in our 
hand is in reality an aggregate of an infinite number of rapidly moving centers of 
energy. Our own will is the only energy of whose direct action we are immedi- 
ately conscious, and we use our experience of it to explain other manifestations of 
energy to ourselves. Modern mathematics, that most astounding of intellectual 
creation, has projected the mind’s eye through infinite time and the mind’s hand 
into boundless space. The very instants of the beginnings of the sun’s eclipses are 
predicted for centuries and zons tocome. Sirius, so distant that the light from its 
surface, traveling at a rate of speed that vies with the lightning, requires more than 
eight and one-half years to reach us, is weighed and its constituents are counted 
almost as accurately as are the bones of our bodies. Yet in 1842 Comte declared 
that it was forever impossible to hope to determine the chemical composition or 
the mineralogical structure of the stars. An unexpected aberration in the motions 
of*Uranus foretold the existence of an undiscovered planet at a given spot in the 
sky, and the telescope of Galle, turned to that precise point, revealed to the aston- 
ished senses what was certain to thought. A discrepancy in the weight of 
nitrogen extracted from the air we breathe but yesterday led Lord Rayleigh, by 
an inexorable logic, to the discovery of a new atmospheric constituent, argon. 
The analytical geometry of Descartes and the calculus of Newton and Leibniz 
have expanded into the marvelous mathematical method—more daring in its 
speculations than anything that the history of philosophy records—of Lobachevsky 
and Riemann, Gauss and Sylvester. Indeed, mathematics, the indispensable tool 
of the sciences, defying the senses to follow its splendid flights, is demonstrating 
to-day, as it has never been demonstrated before, the supremacy of the pure 
reason. 
The great Cayley, who has been given the proud title of the Darwin of the 
English school of mathematicians, said a few years ago:! 
“JT would myself say that the purely imaginary objects are the only realities, 
the 6vras évra, in regard to which the corresponding physical objects are as the 
shadows in the cave; and it is only by means of them that we are able to deny the 
existence of a corresponding physical object; and if there is no conception of 
straightness, then it is meaningless to deny the conception of a ee OCU straight 
line.” 
The physicist, also, is coming to see that his principle of the conservation of 
energy in its various manifestations is a new and startling proof of the funda- 
mental philosophical principle of self-activity. Energy manifests itself as motion, 
heat, light, electricity, chemical action, sound. Each form of its manifestation is 
transmutable into others. The self-active cycle is complete. j 
But it is not from the domain of natural science alone that illustrations of the 
all-conquering power of thought can be drawn. The genius of Champollion has 
called to life the thoughts and deeds of Amenotep and Rameses, and what appeared. 
to sense as rude decorative sketches on the walls of temple and of tomb are seen © 
by the understanding to be the recorded history of a great civilization in the 
valley of the Nile. The inscrutable Sphinx, that watchdog of the Pyramids,

centuries before the storied siege of Troy, now looks down on modern men who 
write the very words of its builders in the language of Shakespeare and of Milton. 
The cries of savage man, the language symbols of the early Aryans, and the multi- 
form and complicated tongues of modern Europe, all so seemingly diverse to the 
ear and to the eye, have been the foundation for the sure laws of comparative 
  philology that the labors and insight of Bopp and Grimm and Verner have built — 
upon them, All these, and the many triumphs like them, are victories of insight; 
each marks a new stage in the conquering progress of the reason, by which it 
finds itself in every part and phase of the cosmos and its life. 
T regard this insight as to self-activity and the primacy of reflective thought as 
the profoundest that philosophy has to offer; and, instead of being urged, as in 
centuries past, in antagonism to the teachings of science, it is now becoming the 
joint conclusion of philosophy and science together. It pulsates, too, in the 
world’s grandest poetry and mostexquisite art. It is the very soul of the verse of 
Homer and of Dante, of Shakespeare and of Goethe. It makes the marble of 
Phidias glow with life, and it guides the hand of Raphael and Michael Angelo as 
they trace their wondrous figures with the brush. It gives immortality to the most 
beautiful of temples, the Parthenon, that 
Friend to man, to whom thou sayest, 
“ Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all 
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” 
It is also the inspiration ot that superb medieval architecture that bears the name 
of the conquerors of Rome, which has given to northern Europe its grandest 
monuments to the religious aspiration and devotion of the Middle Ages. 
What, then, does this insight signify, and what is its bearing upon our educa- 
tional ideals? Obviously, the possession of an insight such as this, wrested from 
nature by the hand of science and from history by that of philosophy, must serve 
in many ways to guide us in estimating the importance of human institutions and 
educational instruments. We can not accept either of these without question 
from the hands of a tradition to which our modern philosophy and our modern 
science were wholly unknown; nor can we blindly follow those believers in a crude 
psychology who would present us with so many mental faculties to be trained, 
each by its appropriate formal exercise, as if they were sticks of wood to be shaped 
and reduced to symmetry and order. Mental life, as Wundtso forcibly says, ‘‘ does 
not consist in the connection of unalterable objects and varying conditions; in all 
its phases it is process—an active, not a passive existence; development, not stag- 
nation.”! Herein is the mental life true to nature. Like nature, it is not fixed, 
but ever changing. This unceasing change, necessary to both growth and devel- 
opment, gives to life its reality and its pathos. It gives also to education its unend- 
ing character and the clew to its wisest processes. 
The question that I am asking, ‘‘What knowledge is of most worth?” is a very 
old one, and the answers to it that have been handed down through the centuries 
are many andvarious. It isa question that each age must put to itself, and answer 
from the standpoint of its deepest and widest knowledge. The wisest philosophers 
have always seen more or less clearly the far-reaching character of the question 
and the great importance of the answer. Socrates and Plato, Augustine and 
Aquinas, were under no illusions as to it; but often in later years the deeper ques- 
tions relating to educational values have been either lost sight of entirely or very 
superficially dealt with. Bacon clothes in attractive axiomatic form some very 
crude judgments as to the relative worth of studies. Rousseau risks his reputa- 
tion for sobriety. of judgment in outlining an educational programme. Herbert 
Spencer turns aside for a moment from his life work to apotheosize science in | 
education, although science is, by his own definition, only partially unified knowl-

edge. Whewell exalts mathematics in language only less extravagant than that 
in which Sir William Hamilton decries it. In similar fashion, others, holding a 
brief for some particular phase or department of knowledge, have come forward 
crying Eureka! and proclaiming that the value of all studies must be measured in 
terms of their newly-discovered standard. The very latest cry is that studies and 
intellectual exercises are valuable in proportion as they stimulate enlarged brain 
areas, thus making the appreciation of Shakespeare, of Beethoven, and of Leon- 
ardo da Vinci solely a function of the circulation of the blood. 
But to sciolists of this type philosophy and science can now make common 
answer. If it be true that spirit and reason rule the universe, then the highest 
and most enduring knowledge is of the things of the spirit. That subtle sense of 
the beautiful and the sublime which accompanies spiritual insight, and is part of 
it, is the highest achievement of which humanity is capable. This sense is typi- 
fied, in various forms, in the verse of Dante and the prose outpourings of Thomas 
& Kempis, in the Sistine Madonna of Raphael and in Mozart’s Requiem. To 
develop this sense in education is the task of art and literature, to interpret it is 
the work of philosophy, and to nourish it the function of religion. Because it 
most fully represents the higher nature of man, it is man’s highest possession, and 
those studies that directly appeal to it and instruct it are beyond compare the 
most valuable. This has been eloquently and beautifully illustrated by Brother 
Azarias, that profound scholar who was taken from us all too soon. ‘Take a 
Raphael or a Murillo,” he says.! ‘*We gaze upon the painted canvas till its 
beauty has entered our soul. The splendor of the beauty lights up within us 
depths unrevealed, and far down in our inner consciousness we discover some- 
thing that responds to the beauty on which we have been gazing. It is as though 
a former friend revealed himself to us. There is here a recognition, The more 
careful has been our sense culture, the more delicately have our feelings been 
attuned to respond to a thing of beauty and find in it a joy forever, all the 
sooner and the more intensely do we experience this recognition. And therewith 
comes a vague yearning, a longing as for something. What does it all mean? 
The recognition is of the ideal.” Toward the full recognition and appreciation of 
this insight into the great works of the spirit, whether recorded in literature, in 
art, or in institutional life, higher education should bend all its energies. The 
study of philosophy itself, or the truly philosophic study of any department of 
knowledge—however remote its beginnings may seem to be—will accomplish this 
end. The ways of approach to this goal are as many as there are human interests, 
for they are all bound together in the bonds of a common origin and a common 
purpose. Theattainment of it is true culture, as Mr. Matthew Arnold has defined 
it: ‘‘The acquainting ourselves with the best that has been known and said in the 
world, and thus with the history of the human spirit.”? 
We now come in sight of the element of truth and permanence in that human- 
ism which Petrarch and Erasmus spread over Europe with such high hopes and 
excellent intentions; but which Sturm, the Strassburg schoolmaster, reduced to 
the dead, mechanical forms and the crude verbalism that bound thé schools in 
fetters for centuries. Of humanism itself we may say, as Mr. Pater says of the 
Renaissance of the fifteenth century, that ‘it was great rather by what it designed 
than by what it achieved. Much which it aspired to do, and did but imperfectly 
or mistakenly, was accomplished in what is called the éclairissement of the 
eighteenth century, or in our own generation; and what really belongs to the 
revival of the fifteenth century is but the leading instinct, the curiosity, the initia- 
tory idea.”

Many of the representative humanists were broad-minded men whose sympa- 
thies were with learning of every kind. Erasmus himself writes with enthusiasm 
of other branches of knowledge than literature. ‘‘ Learning,” he says, ‘‘is spring- 
ing up all around out of the soil; languages, physics, mathematics, each department 
thriving. Even theologyis showing signs ofimprovement.”! But, unfortunately, 
this broad sympathy with every field of knowledge was not yet widespread. The 
wonders and splendor of nature that had brought into existence the earliest reli- 
gions and the earliest philosophies were now feared and despised as the basis of 
paganism; and on wholly false grounds a controversy was precipitated as to the 
relative worth of literature and of science that in one form or another has con- 
tinued down to ourownday. The bitterness with which the controversy has been 
carried on and the extreme positions assumed by the partisans of the one side or 
the other have concealed from view the truth that we are now able to perceive 
clearly—the truth that the indwelling reason, by whom all things are made, is as 
truly present, though in a different order of manifestation, in the world of nature 
as in the world of spirit. One side of this truth was expressed by Schelling when 
he taught that nature is the embryonic life of spirit, and by Froebel when he 
wrote, ‘‘ The spirit of God rests in nature, lives and reigns in nature, is expressed 
in nature, is communicated by nature, is developed and cultivated in nature,”? 
The controversy as to the educational value of science, so far, at least, as it con- 
cerns educational standards and ideals, is, then, an illusory one. It is a mimic 
war, with words alone as weapons, that is fought either to expel nature from edu- 
cation or to subordinate all else in education to it. We should rather say, in the 
stately verse of Milton: 
Accuse not nature: she hath done her part; 
Do thou but thine. 
And that part is surely to study nature joyfully, earnestly, reverently, asa mighty 
manifestation of the power and grandeur of the same spirit that finds expression 
in humanachievement. We must enlarge, then, our conception of the humanities, 
for humanity is broader and deeper than we have hitherto suspected. It touches 
the universe at many more points than one; and, properly interpreted, the study 
of nature may be classed among the humanities as truly as the study of language 
itself. 
This conclusion, which would welcome science with open arms into the school 
and utilize its opportunities and advantages at every stage of education, does not 
mean that all studies are of equal educational value, or that they are mutually 
and indifferently interchangeable, as are the parts of some machines. It means, 
rather, that the study of nature is entitled to recognition on grounds similar to 
those put forward for the study of literature, of art, and of history. But among 
themselves these divisions of knowledge fall into an order of excellence as educa- 
tional material that is determined by their respective relations to the development 
of the reflective reason. The application of this test must inevitably lead us, while 
honoring science and insisting upon its study, to place above it the study of his- 
tory, of lit€rature, of art, and of institutional life. But these studies may not for 
a moment be carried on without the study of nature or in neglect of it. They are 
all humanities in the truest sense, and it is a false philosophy of education that 
would cut us off from any one of them or that would deny the common ground on 
which they rest. In every field of knowledge which we are studying is some law 
or phase of energy, and the original as well as the highest energy is will. In 
the world of nature it is exhibited in one series of forms that produce the results 
known to us as chemical, physical, biological; in the history of mankind it is mani- 
fested in the forms of feelings, thoughts, deeds, institutions. Because the elements

  WHAT KNOWLEDGE IS OF MOST WORTH? 131) 
of self-consciousness and reflection are present in the latter series and absent in 
the former, it is to these and the knowledge of them that we must accord the first: 
place in any table of educational values. 
But education, as Mr. Froude has reminded us,! has two aspects. ‘‘On one side 
it is the cultivation of man’s, reason, the development of his spiritual nature. It 
elevates him above the pressure of material interests. It makes him superior to 
the pleasures and pains of a world which is but his temporary home, in filling his 
mind with higher subjects than the occupations of life would themselves provide 
him with.” It is this aspect of education that I have been considering, for it is 
from this aspect that we derive our inspiration and our ideals. ‘‘But,” continues ~ 
Mr. Froude, “a life of speculation to the multitude would be a life of idleness and 
uselessness. They have to maintain themselves in industrious independence in a 
world in which it has been said there are but three possible modes of existence— 
begging, stealing, and working; and education means also the equipping a man 
with means to earn his own living.” It is this latter and very practical aspect of 
education that causes us to feel at times the full force of the question of educa- 
tional values. Immediate utility makes demands upon the school which it is 
unable wholly to neglect. If the school is to be the training ground for citizen- 
ship, its products must be usefully and soundly equipped as well as well disciplined 
and well informed. An educated proletariat—to use the forcible paradox of Bis- 
marck—is a continual source of disturbance and danger to any nation. Acting 
upon this conviction, the great modern democracies—and the time seems to have 
come when a democracy may be defined as a government, of any form, in which 
public opinion habitually rules—are everywhere having a care that provision be 
made for the practical or immediately useful in education. This is as it should 
be, but it exposes the school to a new series of dangers against which it must 
guard. Utility is a term that may be given either a very broad or a very narrow 
meaning. There are utilities higher and utilities lower, and under no circum- 
stances will the true teacher ever permit the former to be sacrificed to the latter. 
This would be done if, in its zeal for fitting the child for self-support, the school 
were to neglect to lay the foundation for that higher intellectual and spiritual 
life which constitutes humanity's full stature. This foundation is made ready 
only if proper emphasis be laid, from the kindergarten to the college, on those 
studies whose subject-matter is the direct product of intelligence and will, and 
which can therefore make direct appeal to man’s higher nature. The sciences and 
their applications are capable of use, even from the standpoint of this higher order 
of utilities, because of the reason they exhibit and reveal. Man’s rational freedom 
is the goal, and the sciences are the lower steps on the ladder that reaches to it. 
Splendid confirmation of this view of science is found in the great Belfast 
address in which Professor Tyndall stormed the strongholds of prejudice one and 
twenty years ago. Said Professor Tyndall: * : 
“Science itself not unfrequently derives motive power from an ultrascientific 
source. Some of its greatest discoveries have been made under the stimulus of a 
nonscientific ideal. This was the case amongst the ancients, and it has been so 
amongst ourselves. Mayer, Joule, and Colding, whose names are associated with 
the greatest of modern generalizations, were thus influenced. With his usual 
insight, Lange at one place remarks that ‘it is not always the objectively correct 
and intelligible that helps man most or leads most quickly to the fullest and truest 
knowledge. As the sliding body upon the brachystochrone reaches its end sooner 
than by the straighter road of the inclined plane, so through the swing of the ideal 
we often arrive at. the naked truth more rapidly than by the more direct processes 
of the understanding.’ Whewell speaks of enthusiasm of temper as a hindrance |

to science; but he means the enthusiasm of weak heads. There is a strong and 
resolute enthusiasm in which science finds an ally; and it is to the lowering of 
this fire rather than to the diminution of intellectual insight that the lessening 
productiveness of mun of science in their mature years is to be ascribed. Mr. 
Buckle sought to detach intellectual achievement from moral force. He gravely 
erred, for without moral force to whip it into action the achievements of the intel- 
lect would be poor indeed. 
“Tt has been said that science divorces itself from literature, but the statement, 
like so many others, arises from lack of knowledge. A glance at the less technical 
writings of its leaders—of its Helmholtz, its Huxley, and its Du Bois-Reymond— 
would show what breadth of literary culture they command. Where among 
modern writers can you find their superiors in clearness and vigor of literary 
style? Science desires not isolation, but freely combines with every effort toward 
the bettering of man’sestate. Single handed, and supported not by outward sym- 
pathy, but by inward force, it has built at least one great wing of the many- 
mansioned home which man in his totality demands. And if rough walls and 
protruding rafter ends indicate that on one side the edifice is still incomplete, it is 
only by wise combination of the parts required with those already irrevocably built 
that we can hope for completeness. There is no necessary incongruity between 
what has been accomplished and what remains to be done. The moral glow of 
Socrates, which we all feel by ignition, has in it nothing incompatible with the 
physics of Anaxagoras which he so much scorned, but which he would hardly 
scorn to-day. * * * 
“‘The world embraces not only a Newton, but a Shakespeare; not only a Boyle, 
but a Raphael; not only a Kant, but a Beethoven; not only a Darwin, but a Car- 
lyle. Not in each of these, but in all, is human nature whole. They are not 
opposed, but supplementary; not mutually exclusive, but reconcilable. And if, 
unsatisfied with them all, the human mind, with the yearning of a pilgrim for 
his distant home, will still turn to the mystery from which it has emerged, seek- 
ing so to fashion it as to give unity to thought and faith, so long as this is done, 
not only without intolerance or bigotry of any kind, but with the enlightened 
recognition that ultimate fixity of conception is here unattainable, and that each 
succeeding age must be held free to fashion the mystery in accordance with its 
own needs—then, casting aside all the restrictions of materialism, I would affirm 
this to be a field for the noblest exercise of what, in contrast with the knowing 
faculties, may be called the creative faculties of man.” 
The actions of the lower animals are conditioned by sensations and momentary 
impulses. Man, on the other hand, is enabled to raise himself above fleeting sen- 
sations to the realm of ideas, and in that realm he finds his real life. Similarly 
man’s will gradually frees itself from bondage to a chain of causes determined for 
it from without, and attains to a power of independent self-determination accord- 
ing to durable and continuing ends ofaction. This constitutes character, which, in 
Mr. Emerson’s fine phrase, is the moral order seen through the medium of an indi- 
vidual nature. Freedom of the willis not, then, a metaphysical notion, nor is it 
obtained from nature or seen in nature. It is a development in the life of the 
humay soul. Freedom and rationality are two names for the same thing, and 
their highest development is the end of human life. This development is not, as 
Locke thought, a process arising without the mind and acting upon it, a passive 
and pliable recipient. Much less is it one that could be induced in the statue of 
Condillac and Bonnet. It is the very life of the soul itself. 
There is astriking passage in The Marble Faun in which Hawthorne suggests 
the idea that the task of the sculptor is not, by carving, to impress a figure upon 
the marble, but rather, by the touch of genius, to set free the glorious form that

the cold grasp of the stone imprisons. With similar insight, Browning puts these 
words into the mouth of his Paracelsus: 
Truth is within ourselves; it takes no rise 
From outward things, whate’er you may believe. 
There is an inmost center in us all, 
Where truth abides in fullness; and around, 
Wall upon wall, the gross flesh hers it in, 
This perfect, clear perception. * * * 
* * * And, to know, 
Rather consists in opening out a way 
‘Whence the imprisoned splendor may escape, 
Than in effecting entry for a light 
Supposed to be without. 
This is the poetical form of the truth that I believe is pointed to by both philoso-' 
phy and science. It offers us a sure standing ground for our educational theory. 
It reveals to us, not as a hypothesis but as a fact, education as spiritual growth 
toward intellectual and moral perfection, and saves us from the peril of viewing 
it as an artificial process according to mechanical formulas. Finally, it assures 
us that while no knowledge is worthless, for it all leads us back to the common 
cause and ground of all, yet that knowledge is of most worth which stands in 
closest relation to the highest forms of the activity of that spirit which is created 
in the image of Him who holds nature and man alike in the hollow of His hand.

THE RELATION OF MANUAL TRAINING AND ART EDUCATION.! 
InrRopUCTORY ADDRESS. 
By ©. A. Bennett, Professor of Manual Training, Teachers’ College. 
Not very long ago I heard the president of a Southern college deliver an address 
on educational work among the negroes. In the course of his address, in order to 
point out clearly the progress of the work in his own college.and to show the apt- 
ness of the negro to learn and his tendency to adopt the customs and ideas of the 
white man, he said: ‘‘ When we began to teach sewing to our girls we taught them, 
among other‘things, to make-plain aprons. It was not long before they wanted 
to put pockets on their aprons, and now they want to put ruffles around the 
bottoms.” 
This illustration may be used to suggest the steps of progress in other fields of 
education than the missionary work among the negroes of the South. Surely the 
negro has no monopoly on these progressive steps. They are the same that allciy- 
ilized peoples have taken—first, the necessities; second, the conveniences; third, 
the luxuries. The thought suggested in this illustration, it seems tome, might be 
applied to the evolution of a course of instruction or the development of a subject 
in the school curriculum. May we not apply. it to the development of manual 
training work? 
When manual training work began in this country, the courses of instruction 
consisted chiefly of exercises, pure and simple—exercises planned to teach the use 
of a given tool, or to teach a joint or some such element of construction. Soon 
the courses began to contain a few completed useful articles. The immediate 
application of some of the exercises or elements of construction were found to be 
advantageous. It became evident to many teachers that although teaching a 
principle as a principle was a good thing, it was also a good thing to emphasize _

and fix the principle by applying it. The useful article as a manual training exer- 
cise, especially in classes of elementary school grade, was found to be justifiable 
not only on economic grounds but on pedagogic as well. The result is that many 
teachers have so modified their courses that they now contain not only the indi- 
vidual joint, but also its application in a useful article. 
Meanwhile the teachers of drawing have been teaching the children to draw 
graceful lines, and under the name ‘“‘art education” are now helping them to 
appreciate beauty of form and proportion and encouraging them to study the 
principles of decorative art. 
This is influencing the manual training work in many places to an extent that 
we hear something like the requests of the negro girl who wanted to put the ruffle 
around the bottom of her apron. The children wish to decorate the models they 
make. Whether we manual training teachers encourage it or not, we are sure to 
meet with this demand if'we are so fortunate as to have pupils who have been 
taught by a competent teacher of free-hand drawing. The teachers of drawing 
are taking advantage of that instinct in the child which leads him to decorate the 
things he makes; children like to make things that are beautiful. If we do not 
follow the example of the drawing teacher in this, we shall not only fail to reen- 
force their work but we shall be liable to counteract the beneficial effects of it. 
So long as we confined our work to joints and simple exercises there was little 
danger of either reenforcing or counteracting the work of the teacher of art work, 
. but now that we have introduced the completed useful article into our courses we 
are in that danger. Certainly we are not willing to drop the useful article entirely 
out of our courses; neither are we willing to allow our work to counteract the 
work of the teacher of drawing. Our only alternative is to see that the useful 
articles in our courses are so well adapted to their intended use, so excellent in 
form and proportion, so appropriately decorated, if decorated at all, that they will 
meet an artist’s criticism. 
The fact that many manual training models, even some of those published in 
books, would not now bear such criticism is one of the principal reasons for our 
choice of subject for the conference to-day. Since this subject—the relation of 
manual training and art education—suggested itself, many questions have arisen 
in my mind upon which more light is needed: To what extent should decoration be 
introduced into manual training courses? Should manual training teachers make 
it a point to use those materials that lend themselves most readily to decoration— 
clay and strips of iron, forexample? Should we strive to make our models perfect 
in form and proportion and entirely omit decoration? What is the value of wood 
carving and what are its limitations? Should we endeavor to enrich our wood- 
turning courses by introducing vase forms and the like involving subtle curves? 
How large a place should be given to ornamental ironwork in the forging course? 
Would a little work in stained glass be desirable after the work in soldering? Is 
it true that the beautiful interests the children before the useful? If so, how 
should this fact influence our manual-training work in the lower grades? How 
can the teacher of manual training get the most help from the teacher of free-hand 
drawing, and how can the free-hand drawing teacher's work be most helped by the 
teacher of manual training? 
These are but a few of the questions that have arisen in the mind of a teacher of 
manual training. An entirely different list might suggest itself to a director of 
* art education, and still another to a psychologist or a superintendent of public 
schools. It is for the discussion of all such questions that this conference is 
intended.

  MANUAL TRAINING AND ART EDUCATION. 1323 
THE ANSTHETIC ELEMENT IN MANUAL TRAINING. 
By WALTER S. GoopNouGH, Director of Art Education, Public Schools, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
All who are familiar with the history and progress of manual training in this 
country since the days when the Institute of Technology in Boston inaugurated 
the movement, through the efforts of Dr. Runkle, and made its first exhibition at 
the Centennial Exposition of 1876, are painfully aware that until very recently 
the esthetic element has been largely wanting. 
Just as drawing or so-called art instruction in public schools was introduced and 
continued for years almost entirely on a utilitarian basis of the narrowest kind, 
with little or no attempt at real art culture,so manual training has been too 
largely mechanftal in its aim and methods. Manual-training schools and courses 
were planned with the mechanical processes largely in view. The mechanical 
drawing room was well provided. Though there may have been more or less 
free-hand drawing, there was comparatively little real art training, such as would 
enable pupils to put art into their shopwork, and there was little provision-for the 
. artistic forms of manual training. 
It has been well said that art values are the only permanent values; thati is, look- 
ing back over the history of the world, all that we most cherish of that which has 
been left to us from the past is the art in one or another tangible form. Itmay be 
architecture, sculpture, painting, music, literature, or industrial art. 
It is the amount of art in most works produced by man that chiefly affects their 
value. Art is one of the greatest creators of value. 
It is not the mere imitation of art forms that we should have in our manual 
training school courses, but such training as will make possible the creation of art 
forms and the best intellectual and spiritual development. We must develop an: 
art sense, a feeling and appreciation for the beautiful in form, proportion, and 
color, seeking continually to give it expression. We must surround the pupil 
with or give him easy access to good art in various forms; then aim constantly to 
train the imagination and the creative power, and to give plenty of free expression. 
I should commence with the kindergarten to bring esthetic influences to bear. 
Kindergartners need, as a rule, more art training. The drawing and modeling of 
the kindergarten should be freer. The sewing, weaving, and other colored work 
can be more artistic. Bad combinations of color are often permitted. 
Manual training in primary and grammar grades is usually limited to paper 
folding, cardboard work, knife work with thin wood, sloyd and elementary join- 
ing, with perhaps a slight amount of modeling, and with the girls sewing and 
cooking. There should be more modeling. It should continue from the kinder- 
garten through the high-school course. Here the student has the best possible 
opportunity for the study and creation of form. The work should not all be from 
object or copy, but accompanying these exercises there should be regular practice 
in design. Modeling is one of the most inexpensive forms of manual work, both 
for material and equipment, and one in which every impress of hand and mind is 
shown. 
Venetian or bent-iron work is another form of manual training which should 
receive greater attention in grammar grades. With the proper art instruction 
and study of design as a foundation, much free, beautiful, and artistic work is 
possible. This work gives excellent training in subtlety of line and curve. Most 
good will-be lost if pupils simply copy designs. They should study good designs, 
observe, and draw enough of such work to be imbued with its spirit sufficiently to 
produce their own designs, from which they should work. 
The woodwork usually occurring in grammar grades should include, in the 
last year or two, considerable wood carving. Such work gives opportunity for 
most artistic production.
-P-A-G-E-366
    1324 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. ° 
In the manual training, high, or special school, or in the scientific or technical 
school, about half as much time should be given to free-hand drawing and pure 
art study as to mechanicaldrawing. The art study should include much sketching 
and drawing from models, still life, nature, casts, and perhaps some life sketching, 
imaginative or creative work, composition, color study, design, and modeling. 
Something of esthetics or principles of art and of the history of art should be 
included, and pupils should constantly study good art in the shape of acceptable 
industrial examples, photographs, and pictures. 
‘Wherever a public art museum is available, as is the case in most of the larger 
cities and many small ones, there should be intimate relations between the schools 
and the museum, Pupils should visit regularly for study under the guidance of 
a teacher, and the museum ought to have collections that could ge loaned to the 
schools and changed from time to time. Reproductions if not originals of good 
art should hang upon the schoolroom walls. 
It would be worth the while of artists of standing to loan some of their work 
to hang upon the schoolroom wall, or place in cabinets; not alone drawings or 
paintings, but stained glass, beautiful metal work, carving, pottery, etc. 
The art instruction should aim to develop the art sense, an appreciation and — 
love of the beautiful in form and color, a knowledge of the fundamental prin- 
ciples of art and design, an ability to distinguish good work from bad, and a con- 
siderable degree of technical skill. It should be related to or be such as to be 
serviceable in the study of literature, history, and language, as well as in science 
orshop work. It should make possible shop work of a far higher grade than could 
be possible without it. It should give a much greater intellectual development. 
The shop work in many schools should be modified so as to permit more artistic 
work. The training of a skilled mechanic is an easy matter in comparison with 
the making of an artistic artisan. In most courses there is sufficient work to train 
to precision and to the mastery of tools and mechanical processes, but there is too 
little that trains to a refined, subtle skill, and that exercises creative power. We 
should aim to send our pupils out producers as far as possible; leaders, not fol- 
lowers; young men and women with ideas and power to express or execute them. 
As has been intimated, clay modeling should be a more important element, and 
I believe the potter’s wheel could be introduced into the manual training school 
to good advantage. A beauty and refinement of form would be acquired, a deli- 
cacy of touch that wood turning does not give. 
With right art training more artistic results are possible in wood turning and 
inlaying, as well as in wrought-iron work. In wood turning, pupils too frequently 
work from a drawing or blue print which has been prepared for them instead of 
from their own designs. Class after class work the same exercises. Such work 
is dry, uninteresting, and less educational than it should be. The pupil who has 
designed the piece he is to turn, be it a spindle or vase form, has had the study 
in proportion and beauty of outline or form that will result in better work. His 
interest in working out the form he has created is away beyond that of the pupil 
who works from a blue print or a model. 
Wood carving of an artistic kind should occupy a more important place in the 
manual training course. Much that is done is purely mechanical, crude, uninter- 
esting. It shows asad lack of art training on the part of the pupil and teacher. 
Very artistic results are feasible. Of this I am positive, as for a dozen years I had 
this work under my charge and direction as director of the Columbus Art School. 
We had classes of boys and girls from the public schools on Saturdays who did 
most excellent work. 
To summarize: I should say that manual training is in need of enrichment by 
bringing in more of the esthetic element. This will not only give more worthy 
material results, but a greater culture and more valuable training to the pupils. 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
MANUAL TRAINING AND ART EDUCATION. 1325 
To accomplish it more and better art-training is required, and some more artistic 
forms of work should be provided. Better art training of the teachers of shop 
“work in manual training schools is necessary, but this will come when its neces- 
sity is felt by them and by the school authorities. Then will the manual training 
school be able to accomplish more fully that which has been called the supreme 
purpose of education, the development of the capacity for unselfish creative 
activity, and for the highest enjoyment. 
Limitations TO ARTISTIC MANUAL TRAINING. 
By ©. R. Rrowarps, Director of the Department of Science and Technology, Pratt Institute, 
Brooklyn, N. Y. 
It seems to me that this conference affords us an opportunity not only to weigh 
the relation between art education and manual training, but also to acknowledge 
the debt that manual training owes to art education. Our friends, the art teach- 
ers, have always been a sort of foster brothers to us of the manual-training move- 
ment. We were all of the new tendency in education, and when the manual- 
training movement began, the art people, who by that time had gained a fairly 
firm foothold for themselves, lent us a cordial support and most sympathetic 
assistance, and I do not think that we can ever sufficiently repay them for their 
cooperation at that time. 
The purely mechanical character of much of our work, however, has always 
been a great distress to our friends, and from the first they have used all their 
influence to make our work assume a more attractive appearance. The results of 
this influence are to a large extent most happily illustrated by the work brought 
together by this conference, and for this again I think we owe a large debt to 
our friends. I feel most emphatically that our work will continue to be extended. 
in this direction, and that we shall be able in the future to accomplish more and 
better results having a distinct artistic value. j 
There are, however, limitations in this direction, and it is upon the subject of 
these limitations that I wish to say a few words. It seems to me that at the out- 
set we must accept the principle that manual training is not primarily art train- 
ing. In its vital essence, manual training is an instrument that through certain 
processes of tool work serves to train the student in patience, carefulness, neatness, 
and accuracy of doing. Ido not offer this as a complete definition of manual 
training, but this, it seems to me, is the basis of its educational value. { 
The above influences are important elements of character building, but they do 
not in themselves make toward an art training. In this direction our work in the 
public schools must be largely confined to teaching students to appreciate form and 
proportion and fitness of design. In order to gain this appreciation most naturally 
and most effectively, a medium is needed in which the student can most easily 
express. and most easily correct his imperfect conceptions. This medium is pre- 
sented by the processes of drawing and modeling. The exacting and laborious 
processes of tool work are, compared with these, but awkward instruments for the 
development of these ideas. When, after long training, a strong appreciation of 
form and the principles of design have been obtained, wood and iron and stone 
offer the natural opportunities for artistic expression, but during the developing 
period, while the problem is the gaining of form appreciation, it seems to me that 
drawing and modeling must always be the natural vehicles for such training. 
Do not understand me as suggesting that we should not endeavor to bring in 
models of an artistic character in our manual-training work. Imerely mean that 
we should not attempt to model in wood or to draw in iron, but should for certain 
ends seek the natural and legitimate means. I believe most emphatically that we 
should endeavor to make every exercise in our manual training so good in form 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
1326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
and proportion that it will have in itself an esthetic influence. I believe also most 
strongly that we must give larger importance to the element of interest and make 
more frequent use of the finished piece, not at the end of our courses, but inter- 
spersed in simple forms throughout the work. By this direct appeal to the pupil's 
interest we place in the work its own natural stimulant and secure the applica- 
tion of the pupil through the nature of the task. 
I returned a few days ago from what was to me a most interesting and valuable 
trip to some eight of our largest cities, and I found in every one of the manual- 
training people with whom I came in contact the feeling that we must give more 
of a place to this element of interest. We must put in the work those elements 
- which make a direct appeal to the pupil’s imagination and his moral senses. I 
found this feeling even in places where manual training formerly meant a purely 
formal course of exercises. That stage, however, has gone by. We are not going 
back to it. The manual training of the future will recognize that its highest 
results can only be obtained when the imagination and interest of the pupil are 
sufficiently aroused to make of the work indeed a labor of love. 
It is, of course, through this use of the finished project that the opportunities, 
and they are certainly broad ones, come of bringing in an artistic influence; but it 
seems to me that we should not in this matter sacrifice our manual-training prin- 
ciples to our artistic results. In other words, we should not start with the aim 
of artistic or decorative models as the end of manual training, hut should rather 
make of each piece, first, a well-considered exercise in manual training, and then 
endeavor by all in our power to make it good in form and proportion, and perhaps 
in decoration. Manual training is a subject with its own value and with its own 
principles of development, and it seems to me that perhaps the true relation 
between art education and manual training will be obtained when, through all 
our work, we hold securely to our manual-training base and endeavor to build 
upon this all that we can of use and beauty. 
Som PRINCIPLES or DECORATIVE ART. 
By W. H. Goopyear, Lecturer on the History of Art at Cooper Institute, New York City. 
[Abstract.] 
The proverb which says that there is no disputing about tastes has suggested to 
me the historic method as the best one to follow in treating of my subject. To 
ayoid the imputation of presenting individual views or theories, as to principles 
in taste, must be the first effort of the teacher of such principles. The same reasons 
which suggest the appeal to historic examples in fixing the standard of taste in 
music or in literature apply to art. 
Even in speaking of the decorative-art movement of recent years the historic 
method is available, for I am able to say that the principles which I shall explain 
are those of a definite movement which has had widespread influence and a 
defined history, although this history is of recent date. The genesis of the deco- 
rative-art movement and of the art revival of the last fifty years dates back to the 
first studies of art history as made by John Winckelmann in the eighteenth cen- 
tury. His ideas were developed by Lessing, Goethe, and other Germans, and thus 
became the intellectual property of Europe. It was, however, especially reserved. 
* for England and the United States to make practical application of the results of 
‘such studies to modern decorative art. These last-named countries have lagged 
behind the European continental countries in art, historic, and archwologic studies, 
but they have, in my opinion, gone beyond them in the matter of modern, practical 
results, 
. The new movement in England is probably known to you as dating from the 
Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851 and the friendship then cemented between the

Prince Consort and Owen Jones, author of the Grammar of Ornament. Hence 
the founding of the South Kensington Museum and its various branches, and the 
later spread of the decorative-art movement to the United States. The ideas of, 
this movement are best explained by Mr. Eastlake’s book on Household Taste. 
From its great popularity resulted what is known as the Eastlake style of furni- 
ture. Mr. Eastlake himself did not, however, contemplate the creation of a style, 
nor were his designs proposed as the sole feasible notions of taste, in view of the 
flimsy and dishonest carpentry construction prevalent in modern furniture about 
and after 1850. 
Mr. Eastlake’s idea was to show that good taste was compatible with economy, 
simplicity, and good carpentry. The bare simplicity of his designs was caused 
by economic conditions and the necessary expense, even of the plainest articles, 
made in a time when glue had taken the place of joints and when machine-made 
carving had ruined the trade of handcarving. The ‘‘Eastlake” pieces of furniture 
herewith may, however, be regarded as good illustrations of the principle of ‘‘ con- 
structive truth.” Still more important examples of this law may, however, be 
found in all good historic architecture. All objects of large size in furniture 
should be designed on architectural principles. As regards the frank exhibi- 
tion of the carpentry construction and framework and the preference for the 
natural-wood surface and graining as against the use of artificial veneers, what 
may be called the skeleton of construction should generally determine the main 
lines of the piece. . 
‘We may here mention the principles controlling the proper use of ornament in 
architecture, furniture, utensils, and dress. Ornament should emphasize the 
points of support and pressure, the terminal points, joints, seams, outlines, and 
borders. ‘‘All-over” surface ornament is also a phase of constructive use. 
As the object becomes more humble in use or smaller in size, the strictness with 
which the architectural idea is applied should naturally be modified, but the 
Pompeian survivals of Greek taste in utensils are excellent illustrations of the 
wide applicability of the principle of constructive emphasis in the use of orna- 
ment. We find this principle in the bronze vases, lamps, and even in the kitchen 
and cooking utensils of Pompeii. The handle of the bronze vase is the first point 
of departure in its ornamental idea; next come the joints of the handle. 
The principle of constructive truth in decorative art is simply one phase of a 
larger principle which applies to many objects in which a‘ definite type of con- 
structive form is not to be expected—for instance, an inkstand, a saltcellar, a 
match box, a comb, a pair of bellows, a pair of nutcrackers, an andiron, a lamp, 
etc. This larger principle is that of uniting utility and beauty to make the orna- 
mental useful and to make the useful ornamental. In all historic periods down to 
the eighteenth century this principle has been applied to all the humble objects 
named and to many others. It is seen, for instance, in the Pompeian weight 
used in ordinary grocery scales, which takes the shape of a human head. 
Whenever the use of ornament becomes general, according to principles so far 
far specified, it is clear that the rules controlling the treatment of life forms in 
ornament become fundamentally important. 
If the nineteenth century had made a wider use of ornamental carving, it would 
be more accustomed to the treatment known as the conventional, one of whose 
phases is that of the grotesque. Contrary to widespread preconceived ideas nat+ 
ural to modern thought, the realistic or naturalistic treatment of life forms is 
generally improper in decoration. 
One of the reasons for this principle relates to the unnatural appearance of a 
natural animal or human form which forms one portion of an object of use. Take 
the leg of an Italian trousseau chest as example. It has the imaginary and gro- 
tesque form of a griffin. As joined to the rest of the piece of furniture and
-P-A-G-E-370
    1328 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
forming a necessary part of it, a real animal or human form would be an absurd- 
ity in such a place. We are not dealing with a piece of sculpture, with a work of 
art having an independent mission. Under the given circumstances to demand 
the realistic treatment is to ask that the legs should cost more money and effort 
than the whole piece besides. It would be to ask the genius and science of a great 
sculptor from the trade of the cabinetmaker. The principle of subordination—that 
the part is less than the whole and less important than the whole—is one principle 
at stake. Another is the unnatural appearance of a natural form forming only 
one part of a constructive form. Still another is the principle requiring pro- 
nounced visibility in ornamental forms. The angular, the rigid, the sharply 
defined forms necessary to the effect of decorative carving are rarely compatible 
with realistic rendering of nature. In the Pompeiian survivals of Greek art we 
find the drunken Silenus and the fawn with legs of a goat confined to decorative 
objects, lamps, and the like. The full-size Greek statue avoids the intoxicated 
Silenus or the fawn with goat’s legs. This brings us back to the principle of sub- 
- ordination under another guise, i. e., the distinction between ideal art, or art for 
art’s sake, and art for the sake of decoration. The field of the sublime and ideally 
beautiful is not, generally speaking, that of decorating utensils and objects of 
daily use, but in these the play of the imagination may generally have its share in 
. the guise of the grotesque. We find the Gorgon head, but never the head of 
Minerva, on the handles of a Greek vase. 
Illustrations of conventional or grotesque treatment may be found in this Mexi- 
can stirrup, having the form of a human head, and in nutcrackers of the seven- 
teenth century Renaissance. 
The use of the reptilian form in ornament as seen in Palissy ware, in ancient 
jewelry, and in the faience of the Renaissance reflects the fact that the reptilian 
form yerges on the grotesque, and here we find not only the idea of subordination 
but also the fact that the reptile form is more striking to the eye and therefore 
most available among animal forms for decorative use. The use of the dramatic 
mask in place of the human face in antique and Renaissance art is another apt 
illustration. It may be also noted that the periods most fertile in grotesque dec- 
orative art have been also those in which spiritual and ideal beauty were most 
highly appreciated and most successfully represented in their own appropriate 
sphere. The periods of Phidias and of Raphael are those most fertile in the cre- 
ation of the grotesque in ornamental art. 
We may next consider some points relating to appropriate treatment of a given 
material. Highly arbitrary forms due to the momentary and necessarily arbi- 
trary impulse of the glass blower are beautiful in Venetian glass, but wholly 
improper in pottery, metal, or wood. <A jar handle wholly beautiful in metal may 
be wholly improper in pottery. The sense of weight, the feeling that an object is 
becoming cumbersome, would forbid copying the form of a lamp with a cylindrical 
porcelain body in the same dimension in metal. In metal the treatment should 
be that befitting the appearance of a material that is ductile and pliable during 
manufacture. Angular and heavy designs should be avoided in this material. 
The contrasts here offered are those between recent American chandeliers, some 
of better and some of inferior taste. 
Finally we notice the general inadvisability of direct copying of historic forms 
for modern decorative art, however valuable may be the lessons to be learned 
from them. Such copies generally overlook the principles observed by the origi- 
nals. A Pompeian lamp designed for oil and wick is an inappropriate form for a 
chandelier using gas. An Ionic capital is hardly appropriate as the support of a 
cruet stand. The Parthenon frieze is out of place on acake casket. The illus- 
trations show these mistakes in recent designs of American silverware. 
_ In closing my remarks let me say that I know them to be largely of a character

not directly related to the elementary teaching work in manual training; but as 
long as we confine the education of teachers to the points necessary to the elemen- 
tary teachers’ work in the direct education of children we shall never achieve 
great educational results. It is the atmosphere surrounding children which we 
should consider as moreimportant than directteaching. What they learn directly 
is not so important as the influence of the teacher's taste exerted insensibly and 
unconsciously. Thisis the taste to be created and developed first—the taste of the 
teacher and the parent. It is undeniable that this taste has been generally lacking 
in the civilized nations of the nineteenth century, excepting in so far as the art 
revival of the last forty years has striven to create it, and it is equally undeniable 
that this art revival was inspired by the continental interest in historic examples. 
Ill. 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES OF 1896. 
The revival of the Olympic games, one of the most notable events of 1896, is due 
to the enthusiasm and persistence of Baron Pierre de Coubertin. This gentleman 
traveled extensively in Europe and in the United States to rouse interest in the 
project, and at a meeting of the delegates of the athletic associations of all coun- 
tries, assembled at Paris in 1894,1it was agreed that the games should be instituted. 
For the execution of the purpose, an international committee was appointed. 
The first presidency was assigned to M. Bikelas, a Greek, since in his country the 
revival of the games was to be first celebrated. The presidency will fall in suc- 
cession to a representative of the country in which the next games are to be held. 
Wnder this arrangement, Baron de Coubertin, the founder, has become the second 
president, the next contest having been appointed to take place at Paris during 
the exposition of 1900. 
The first celebration opened at Athens, April 6, 1896, The scene and the spirit 
of the occasion are happily reproduced in the following letters, penned on the 
spot by Baron de Coubertin, and reproduced, with his permission, from the Jour- 
nal des Débats, in which they originally appeared. 
The roll of the victors is quoted from an article by the same author published 
in the Century Magazine for November, 1896. 
“The Athenians enjoy this year a twofold spring; ity warms at the same time 
the illuminated atmosphere and the popular spirit; it gives life to the small, fra- 
grant flowers that force their way between the marble slabs of the Paeees and 
imparts a smile of satisfaction to the lips of the proud ‘Palakares’ (champions of 
the people). The sun shines and the Olympic games are at hand. Nothing 
remains of the irony and fears of the last year. The skeptics are silent and the 
Olympic games have no more enemies. French, Russian, American, German, 
Swedish, and English flags are for sale on every hand. The Attic breeze joyously 
raises its light folds, and men in ‘fustanellas,’ who lounge before the pictur- 
esque show windows of the rue d’ Hennes, rejoice at the spectacle. They know 
that the whole world is coming (‘l’univers va venir’) and approve of the prepara- 
tions made for their appropriate reception. These preparations are manifold. 
Everywhere the marbles are scraped, new plaster and fresh paints are put on, the 
pavers are at work, and people are busy cleaning and decorating. The street 
of the stadion is a fine sight, with its triumphal arch and Venetian masts. Its 
  
1 Since the close of the first celebration at Athens of the Olympic games revived by the Inter- 
national Congress at Paris in 1894 it was decided to strike off a medal commemorative of this 
congress. Copies will be sold (Florentine bronze, 12 francs; old silver, 25 frances) strictly to per- 
sons who participated in the work of the congress or in its organization. The disposition of the 
medals will be made on some ceremonial occasion, the date of which will be ultimately fixed.

usual whiteness is exaggerated to a dazzling brilliancy. But it is no longer the 
favorite promenade. The interest is centered elsewhere upon the banks of the 
formerly disdained Illissus. Every evening, toward 5 o'clock, the citizen$ pass in 
long procession, observing the work on the stadion with the eye of connoisseurs, 
The Illissus has no water, as usual; but no one notices this any more. A monu- 
mental bridge now spans the celebrated river and gives access to the level plain, 
upon which opens the restored stadion, There to-morrow, Easter Monday, April} 
6, King George will proclaim the reestablishment of the Olympic games, which 
fifteen hundred and two years ago the Emperor Theodosius declared suppressed 
forever. 
‘“‘The inclosure of the stadion produces an intense impression, which becomes 
even more Vivid inreflection. Behold the spectacle that the ancients have so often 
contemplated! It rises again before our eyes. Up to this time we have not been 
accustomed to such a plan, and the unfamiliar lines at first sight surprise and 
confuse us. The silhouette of the Greek temple has never been lost; the porticos 
and the colonnades have known twenty renaissances. But the stadia died at the 
same time as the athletic games. Their architectural features were known, but 
they have never been restored. A living stadion (stade vivant) has not been seen 
for centuries. Yet a few hours, and this one will be alive with the collective life 
imparted to the monuments by the crowds that throng them. <A crowd will 
ascend the staircases, fill the benches that rise one above another, and mass them- 
selves in the passages. <A very different crowd, no doubt, from that which last 
entered a similar stadion, animated, however, by like sentiments, by the same 
sympathy for youth, and by the same desire for human harmony. 
“There will be room for about 50,000 spectators. Part of the benches are of 
wood, time having failed for hewing a sufficient number of marble blocks and 
putting them in place. After the games the construction will be finished, thanks 
to the inexhaustible liberality of M. Averoff. Bronze chariots, statues, and col- 
umns will break the somewhat severe monotony, and this generous citizen will 
have endowed his fatherland with a monument worthy of it. The central rink 1s 
not dusty as formerly; the track has been made of cinders by an English work- 
man, and according to the latest rules of moden art. 
“‘Eyerything tends to show that henceforth the stadion will be jealously main- 
tained by the Greeks, for—and this is an interesting fact—in this country where 
bodily exercises count no more adepts, where fencing and gymnastic societies of 
recent formation have had much trouble in recruiting a few members, the men- 
tion of Olympic games has sufficed to create athletes. The young people have 
suddenly become conscious of the vigor and suppleness stored away in the race; 
their ardor has been so great, their enthusiasm so persistent, that foreign compet- 
itors will here meet improvised rivals as formidable as veterans, 
“The Hungarians have already arrived under the leadership of our amiable 
representative in Hungary—M. Kemény, director of the Royal School of Budapest. 
They have met with an enthusiastic reception; speeches have been interchanged; 
the band has played. Within a few days the Russians are expected; after them 
the Americans, the Swedes, etc. The news that the municipal council of Paris has 
voted an appropriation to the French delegates reached us during a session of the 
committee on games at the palace of the Royal Prince. The Prince was delighted 
to know that the participation of France was henceforth assured. Our represent- 
atives do not yet pronounce Greek in the modern way; M. Combes! has come too 
late. - But they will learn many things during their short sojourn at the foot of the 
Acropolis. How amazed they will be the first day in the presence of the reality of 
_ those places associated in their memories with the idea of antiquity, but which they

will find so young and full of life, How they will wonder at the easy freedom with 
which resuscitated Athens surrounds the Parthenon without being dwarfed by the 
majestic beauty of the monument and without diminishing in the least its tran- 
quil serenity. Then suddenly will come to their minds a doublerevelation. They 
will recognize that antique Greece has been deformed by unskillful teaching and 
that there exists a modern Greece of which they know nothing. They will per- 
ceive that the one is connected with the other by the closest bonds of resemblance 
and heredity. And the history of the world will take, in their eyes, a new sense 
and different coloring, because henceforth they will know that a nation may be 
walled in a tomb and yet not be dead.”—[Journal des Débats, April 6, 1896.] 
“The programme of the ‘Great Week’ has been definitely arranged. At this 
moment it is in press and will appear to-morrow. Easter Monday, April 6, is the 
day announced for the inauguration of the Stadion, the beginning of the Olympian 
games. The King will preside, surrounded by his ministets, members of the Greek 
Parliament, and the diplomatic corps. Foot races will begin on that day and con- 
tinue during the several days following. The city is to be illuminated in the 
evening. On Tuesday, 7th, there will be fencing at the palace of the Zappeion, 
and at nightfall the Acropolis will be illuminated. On Wednesday, 8th, the shoot- 
ing ‘stand’ and the ‘Velodrome’ will be officially opened. The stand is con- 
structed at Calitthera, on the road from Athens to Phalerum. The committee on 
shooting, presided over by His Royal Highness Prince Nicolas, desired to doa 
great thing. They have erected a magnificent building that will alsoremain after 
the games. It contains vast halls, luxurious dressing rooms, and a terrace which 
serves asa gallery, from which the view extends beyond Salamis to the steep shores 
of the Peloponnesus. The Velodrome is erected in the plain of New Phalerum; 
it has been copied from that of Copenhagen and seems to satisfy the requirements 
of the cyclists. The Athenian Society has already tried it, and the royal family 
on this occasion occupied a pretty gallery reserved forthem. This is araised plat- 
form, surrounded by a balustrade and ornamented with mosaic flooring, From 
this can be seen the Parnassus, the Pentelicus, and the Hymettus. The Acropolis 
appears above the villas of the Phalerum, and in the midst of this classic scene, 
surrounded by classical decoration, the most modern (fin de siécle) of sports takes 
the first place. A striking contrast in truth—the bicycle at the foot of the 
Parthenon! How manytimes have these words been thrown at me with a scornful 
accent as a supreme argument against the modernization of the Olympic games! 
Very well; to-day it shocks no one. To playlawn tennis before the Colosseum or 
to ride a bicycle under the Arch of Titus would indeed cause a disagreeable 
impression. The Roman monuments are dated; they belong to an age. The 
Parthenon has none; it belongs to all times; no manifestations of popular life can 
disfigure it. On Easter Thursday the competition between gymnasts will take 
place at the Stadion; Swedes, Germans, Greeks, and Englishmen will take part. 
The violent opposition of the president of the Belgian Federation to the admission 
of gymnasts to the Olympian games has not beensuccessful; what little opposition 
remains will no doubt vanish before the hour strikes for the second Olympiad. 
Friday will witness a race at Marathon and celebrations at night in the harbor of 
the Pirzeus. 
“Saturday is given to swimming competition. It will take place in the charm- 
ing little Bay of Zea, toward whose shores descend the closely built houses of 
modern Pirzeus, adorned with balconies and terraces covered with fruitful vines. 
Rustic seats surround the shore, the lowest reaching to the blue waters of the 
beautiful bay. Never had swimmers for the display of their strength a more 
charming inclosure. The last two days, Sunday, the 12th, and Monday, the 13th, 
are devoted to other nautical sports—yachting and rowing. A pavilion has been 
constructed in the Bay of Naunichie to shelter the boats and- give to the rowers
-P-A-G-E-374
1332 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
the comfort of an English club. The pavilion is elegant. It is built of different 
colored wood, and near it are the ruins of an antique temple, while back of the 
hill can yet be seen, half buried in the sand, some remains of the long walls which 
connect Athens with the Pirzeus. Upon apromontory rises the villa of ‘Coumoun- 
douros,’ the favorite residence of this great minister. Thusis repeated in epitome 
on the shores of this bay the wonderful history of the Greek nation in spite of 
opposition; here athletics become historic; but here the past is so intimately 
interwoven with the present that only strangers are surprised by the relation. 
“The international committee will hold a session on Saturday. Six of its mem- 
bers have arrived—M. Bikelas, Greek delegate; General Bontowski, Russian dele- 
gate; Dr. Gebhart, German; Messrs. Kemény and Jiri Guth, Hungarian and 
Tcheqne representatives; Commandant Balck, Swedish representative, and your 
obedient servant. This international committee represents the permanency of the 
institution. To this committee falls the difficult task of making the various 
national committees cooperate in this unique work. There are some rivalries 
existing among them; some misunderstandings; some opposed tendencies. The 
presidency of the committee belongs to the nation in which the games will be 
celebrated. M. Bikelas has presided until now. For four years it will pass into 
French hands, Tuesday, the 14th, the close of the Olympian games for 1896 will 
take place in the stadion, The King will distribute prizes to the victors, which 
consist of a diploma and a medal, the work of Chaplain. This celebrated artist 
has engraved upon one side the silhouette of the rock of the Acropolis, with the 
Propylwa and the Parthenon; on the other side the head of Jupiter Olympus. It 
is no more the symbolic branch of antiquity, but neither is it the ‘venal prize’ 
which is so dearly beloved by modern sportsmen. It isa simple souvenir associat- 
ing art with athletism, and thus maintaining traditions of the disinterestedness 
which ought to be the very base of sports. Amateurism will never have had a 
grander manifestation in its favor. Even those who are used to accept without 
embarrassment gold pieces earned by their endurance or their agility would blush 
to even touch the coin here. In this unrivaled scene, in the presence of over- 
whelming glories, a money prize would seem unbearable. This sentiment proves 
better than anything else that the principle is itself wrong.”—[Journal des 
Débats, April 8, 1896.] 
“The triumph of the ‘barbarians’ in the Olympic competition has in general — 
been very gracefully accepted by the audience. At the entrance of the stadion, 
in full view of the audience, there is a mast, at the foot of which, after each test, 
the ‘order number’ of the conqueror is fastened, while at the peak of the mast the 
flag of his country is displayed. This is an ingenious device for announcing 
the victors to the audience and for distinguishing the international character of 
the games. From this place of honor have been seen, waving by turns, the colors 
of the great European nations; but the flag that has been seen most frequently is 
the Star-Spangled Banner of the United States. This was just, as Americans 
were the first to become interested in our work, and the only people who have 
never doubted our success. The two teams that were equipped and sent out by 
the Americans have shown from the beginning their athletic valor and surpassing 
enthusiasm. Already the astonished Athenians proclaim them professional; they 
can not believe that these handsome young men, with such flexible muscles, are 
students in a hurry to return to their studies, but modestly satisfied to Pe in 
~ this manner increased the prestige of their universities. 
‘Whenever the American flag unfolds on the stadion, it excites wild enthusi- 
asm. High up, crowded together on the last tiers, some sailors rise, swinging 
their caps and uttering loud hurrahs. It is the crew of the Federal cruiser San 
Francisco, at this time anchored in the harbor of the Pireus. Below, near the 
famous subterranean passage from which to-day, as formerly, the athletes enter
-P-A-G-E-375
    - 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES OF 1896. 1333 
and go out, there is standing a group, from which frantic acclamations arise. 
They are those entered as competitors and their friends from the American School 
of Athens, who salute the champion with the rallying cry of his club or college. 
Each transatlantic association has a distinct yell, in most cases formed of the 
syllables of the name, or of the initials which one utters in pronouncing them. 
Sailors and students, agitated by the same patriotism, answer each other with 
growing enthusiasm, over the heads of the crowd. The audience commences by 
laughing. Then they applaud, because they feel the sincerity of the joy mani- 
fested; the juvenile ardor animating these inharmonious manifestations. 
«The Olympic games are not by any means the first contact between America 
and Greece; other ties exist between them than ‘Cook’s tickets,’ other interests 
than those of tourists from widely separated countries. The educated American, 
perhaps more than the European, considers a pilgrimage to the Acropolis a 
supreme satisfaction that every enlightened mind should secure to himself as the 
greatest source of mental culture. He is not, as we are, imprisoned under the 
ruins of the Roman Empire, that is so heavy and complicated; he understands 
more readily the ethereal organization of this antique democracy, with which his 
own has more than one resemblance. It is this feeling that has prompted Ameri- 
cans to found a schoolof archeology at Athens. This fact is little known outside 
of Athens. Even here péople do not appreciate its importance, which is, however, 
considerable. This American colony, established on the slopes of Lycabettus, 
supported by the voluntary contributions of citizens, solely devoted to the culture 
of science, opens up to the future of the United States an endless perspective. 
«<The Greeks, who love the Americans, and know that the love is returned, 
have therefore heartily applauded their success; they have even smiled at that 
student of Princeton, a self-made (improvisé) discobolus, who won a prize which 
they believed to be theirs by hereditary rights. But their chagrin would have 
been intense had the cup offered by M. Michel Bréal to the ‘ Marathon runner’ 
escaped them. They were not compelled to undergo that strain. It was a Greek 
who first entered the stadion, having accomplished in two hours and fifty minutes 
those 42 kilometers which separate Athens from Marathon. His arrival created 
great excitement. The stadion was completely filled. The picturesque hill that 
overhangs it from the side of the sea was covered with people; there were at least 
60,000 spectators. In the hemicycle were the King of Greece, the King of Servia, 
the Grand Duke George, the Grand Duchess Theresa, the prince royal of Greece, 
the Grecian ministers, and the diplomatic corps. In a moment, as the approach 
of the victor was signaled, the whole multitude arose as if moved by an electric 
current. The thunder of applause rolled across the plain toward the foot of 
Parnassus, as if to awaken in their subterranean abodes the manes of their 
ancestors; it was, in fact, not simply the accomplished act which provoked these 
transports, but rather the pent-up remembrance of the whole glorious past 
manifested, in that runner, to the vision of the Greek. Then, in order to with- 
draw him from the dangerous effusion of a delirious crowd, the prince royal and 
his brother, Prince George, carried him away in their arms to the dressing room, 
and then the enthusiasm arose anew, like an irresistible wave, before that superb 
picture, which placed side by side, in so graphic a manner, the past and the future. 
“It was long before quiet was restored. Just beside me I saw a lady unfasten 
her watch and send it as a present to the young hero of the day. A patriotic land- 
lord of a hotel signed an order for 365 good repasts, and one of the bootblacks at 
the corner of a street offered to take care of his boots in future gratuitously. 
There is a comic touch in this, but it is impressive if one considers the sentiment 
that prompted these offerings. All those seen by me on that eventful evening, 
even the greatest sneerers, had participated in the general emotion, and our dis- 
tinguished countryman, M. Charles Maurras, who had opposed me formerly for  
-P-A-G-E-376

wanting to ‘internationalize’ the games, declared himself converted. He said to 
me: ‘I see’—and this is profoundly just—‘I see that this internationalism will 
not destroy the fatherlands, but will fortify them.’”—[Jour. des Débats, Apr 
22, 1896.] a ; 
“Roll of the victors, prizes, etc.—When the roll of the victors was called, it | 
became evident, after all, that the international character of the institution was 
well guarded by the results of the contests. America had won nine prizes for 
athletic sports alone (flat races for 100 and 400 meters; 110-meter hurdle race; 
high jump; broad jump; pole vault; hop, step, and jump; putting the shot; 
throwing the discus) and two prizes for shooting (revolver, 25 and 30 meters); 
but France had the prizes for foil fencing and for four bicycle races; England 
scored highest in the one-handed weight-lifting contest and in single lawn tennis; 
Greece won the run from Marathon, two gymnastic contests (rings; climbing the 
smooth rope), three prizes for shooting (carbine, 200 and 300 meters; pistol, 25 
meters), a prize for fencing with sabers, and a bicycle race; Germany won in 
wrestling, in gymnastics (parallel bars; fixed bar; horse leaping) and in double 
lawn tennis; Australia, the 800-meter and 1,500-meter foot races on the flat; Hun- 
gary, swimming matches of 100 and 1,200 meters; Austria, the 500-meter swim- 
ming match and the twelve-hour bicycle race; Switzerland, a gymnastic prize; 
Denmark, the two-handed weight-lifting contest. 
“The prizes were an olive branch from the very spot at Olympia where stood 
the ancient Altis, a diploma drawn by a Greek artist, and a silver medal chiseled 
by the celebrated French engraver Chaplain. On one side of the medal is the 
Acropolis, with the Parthenon and the Propyla; on the other, a colossal head of 
the Olympian Zeus, after the type created by Phidias. The head of the god is 
blurred, as if by distance and the lapse of centuries, while in the foreground, in 
clear relief, is the victory, which Zeus holds on his hand. It is a striking and 
original conception. After the distribution of the prizes, the athletes formed for 
the traditional procession around the stadion. Lonés, the victor of Marathon, 
came first, bearing the Greek flag; then the Americans, the Hungarians, the 
French, the Germans. The ceremony, moreover, was made more memorable by 
a charming incident. One of the contestants, Mr. Robertson, an Oxford student, 
recited an ode which he had composed, in ancient Greek and in the Pindaric mode, 
in honor of the games. Music had opened them, and poetry was present at their 
close; and thus was the bond once more renewed which in the past united the 
muses with feats of physical strength, the mind with the well-trained body. The 
King announced that the first Olympiad was at an end, and left the stadion, the 
band playing the Greek national hymn and the crowd cheering.”—(Century Maga- 
zine, November, 1896.)

IDEALS OF EDUCATIONAL WORK.! 
By President WILLIAM R. HARPER, University of Chicago. 
- I doubt if even the professional educator has a full conception of the intense 
educational activity which in a multitude of forms exists among us. With kin- 
dergartens, private schools, primary and grammar schools, high schools, normal 
schools and academies, boys’ schools and young ladies’ seminaries, schools of music, 
schools of art, schools of engineering, schools of architecture, schools of law, 
schools of medicine, colleges and universities, with the many special efforts which 
are being made to bring the results of educational work into the possession of the 
people, efforts which have assumed the most definite and rounded forms in that

work, the very name of which to-day is a household word—university extension; 
with that educational work of an indirect though real character carried on through 
the powerful agency of the press, as seen in journals and magazines, and which 
constitutes one of the most effective agencies of our manifold educational activities, 
with all these, I say, there is at the same time a diversity and complexity which 
bewilder and confound us, and it is only in a few cases that the educational expert 
has shown any adequate realization of the amount and variety of American 
educational work. ° = 
It does not require the knowledge of an expert to see that in this great multi- 
plicity of plan and method, purpose and scope, there is no such thing as system. 
This work consists of a hundred thousand disconnected parts, without adjustment 
to each other and entirely devoid of relationship to any general scheme. These 
parts can not be said to be even loosely connected. The same thing is repeated in 
a thousand ways, each way, however, being sufficiently distinct and different to 
make void every effort looking toward adjustment or connection. Germany may 
be said to haveasystem of education; France likewise; but in America, as a whole, 
there is no trace of anything that might be rightly called a system. Itis true that 
there is a so-called public school system; but this is at best partial, covering only 
asmall portion of the field, and in effective operation only in certain portions of 
the country. There is in certain States—for example, Michigan and Minnesota— 
something which looks like a system in the relationship that exists between gram- 
amar schools and high schools and between high schools and the State university; 
but this also is only partial and of questionable efficiency, even in the States in 
which it has been most fully developed. 
It is possible to go even further, and to say that there is no such thing as order. 
Whatever phase of this activity we study, there is discovered chaos and confusion— 
no order or plan. It will be granted thata work may be carried on systematically, 
evenif it does not constitute a system; but-we look in vain to the country at large, 
toa single State, to the best of all States, or to a single county, or even to a city, 
for an organization which may reasonably be called systematic. It can not be 
found. 
It is possible that the results of our work as at present conducted may justify 
the lack of a system; and, indeed, the lack of system. There are those who praise 
unduly these results. They are in most cases, however, persons unfamiliar with 
the results obtained from other countries; for it is beyond dispute that the average 
boy of 18 or 19 who has finished the grammar and high school courses has had no 
such advancement as the boy of corresponding age in Germany. It is beyond 
dispute that whatever advantages the average American college possesses, what- 
ever it may do for its students in discipline and in real effectiveness, it by no 
means ranks with a gymnasium or the lycée. The results do not justify 
either the amount of money expended or the amount of work given to the cause 
of education in America. The introduction of order and system would double 
the efficiency of the work done, save two to four years in the life of every stu- 
dent, and secure a thoroughness which would revolutionize American methods 
in politics, business, and letters. No one who has intelligently considered the 
question will fail to realize the disastrous consequences which have attended the 
utter lack of system in allour educational work. But it is the question, however, 
not of system in educational work, for concerning this there is no question, but of — 
a system in educational work that I would speak. 
The question is, Have we waited long-enough, and has the time come when effort 
of a most vigorous character should be put forth to do that which hitherto we 
have expected to be done of itself? The difficulties attending the adoption of any 
general plan which could be denominated a system have not been overlooked. 
(a) Weare still a young and undeveloped nation. Has the proper time arrived  
-P-A-G-E-378
  1336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
for a national system which shall not only include all that has thus far grown up, 
but at the same time organize the whole into an organic and systematic unity? 
(b) We are not as yet a people. The term peoples is more appropriate. Many 
and discordant are the elements of which we are composed. Is it possible to 
develop a system which shall be pleasing to all? (c) Will not better results be 
achieved if we move along independent lines, each investigator watching the results 
of all and adopting from time to time that which commends itself to him? These 
and many other objections present themselves in opposition to the advocacy of a 
system. But 1 would answer: (1) We have at our command the wisdom and experi- 
ence of all the ages, and if we are not in a position to-day to take the necessary 
steps to formulate a system, we shall never be. (2) The very fact that as a people 
we have among us representatives of so many nationalities; the very fact that our 
great purpose in reference to all foreign nationalities is the purpose to American- 
ize them—in other words, the very circumstances of our situation—should incite 
us to provide a system of education which, like our American system of govern- 
ment, should be unique and worthy the name American. (8) The adoption of a 
system does not shut out experiment and investigation, but rather encourages 
them. Asystem is not necessarily rigid and mechanical, but may be most flexible. 
Nor is it supposed that any system will continue to be used without modification. 
The very fact that it is a system carries with it the idea of growth, and growth 
means change. 
It would be an audacious thing for me to propose to you a system of education 
for America. I have no such thingin mind. Such a proposition, when it comes, 
must come from one wiser and more experienced than I shall ever be. The truth 
is the system, when it is once evolved, will prove to be the outcome of the wisdom 
and experience of hundreds of men. In order that such a system may come, how- 
ever, every man who has at heart the highest interest of education should seek to 
make his contribution, however small and insignificant, for consideration in the 
counsels of those to whom this great trust will some time be committed. Besides, 
each one of us engaged to-day in educational work owes to himself and to his 
work to present as frequently and as forcibly as circumstances and ability will 
permit his conceptions of the educational principles which should operate, whether 
with or without asystem. Situated as we are, each in his way is working out a 
system more or less comprehensive, more or less local; each is engaged in an 
experiment the result of which will be of interest to all. I venture, therefore, to 
present a few of the ideas which, in my opinion, will characterize the educational 
work of the future, whether we are to have in mind the needs of a single institu- 
tion or those of a district, or whether it be our plan to cover as years go by broader 
territory and include many institutions of many grades. 
First of all, and, if I mistake not, most fundamental of all, is the principle of 
individualism, a principle capable of application alike to students, instructors, 
and institutions. Every man born into the world comes into it with the limita- 
tions of his work clearly defined by nature. The man who succeeds in life is sim- 
ply the man who is fortunate enough to discover the thing nature intended him 
todo. In some cases nature has seen fit to indicate early and definitely the line 
of work in which success may be attained. In others, the discovery is made, if 
at all, late in life. In the growth and development of the body and mind, each 
man or woman is to be treated as if he or she were the one person in existence. 
The individual, not the mass, is to be cared for. From the beginning the stu- 
dent should receive such treatment as will enable those who are watching his 
development to learn what he can do only with difficulty. But this is not to be 
limited to the beginning; it should be continued to the very end of what would 
be called the preliminary period, a period in which the case of every individual 
continues until the clearest evidence has been secured of the discovery of the prin- 
   
-P-A-G-E-379
  IDEALS OF EDUCATIONAL WORK. 1337 
cipal work which the individual can do to advantage. When once the discovery 
has been made, the pupil should be allowed to devote himself, with certain quali- 
fications, uninterruptedly to that for which, as experiment has shown, nature 
fitted him. The next aim will be to develop those functions which are capable of 
development. It will not be forgotten that the culture shall be as broad as possi- 
ble; but it is true that the possible fields of mental culture are multitudinous, and 
that, after all, no man, however broadly cultivated, comes into contact with many 
of the fields. It must be admitted that a large part of educational work fails 
utterly of accomplishing the thing in view. Men pass through all the grades of 
primary and secondary work, enter college and also do university work, and yet 
are reckoned by the world at large, and even by those most intimately associated 
with them, as failures. And as far as adding anything to the life of themselves 
or others, they are failures. Why is this so? Because the idea has prevailed so 
extensively that men might be educated en masse; that one after another they 
might be ground through the curriculum of study without reference to special 
‘taste and predilection. 
A class of 50 men enter college, no two of them alike in equipment, natural 
taste, mental aptitude, or intellectual ability, and yet they have been required to 
take the same studies, within the same number of hours, in the same way and 
with a sameness throughout that makes college life for most of them a distasteful 
thing and an injury. I stand ready to assume the responsibility for the statement 
that many men are injured by college training, and that cause of the injury in 
nine cases out of ten has been the inflexible cast-iron routine of the college curric- 
ulum, which, let us congratulate ourselves, is fast becoming a thing of the past. 
Less harm has been done than would otherwise have been the case, because as a 
matter of fact only men of a certain disposition in days past have received an edu- 
cation. A great change has taken place among us to-day. Men of different types 
of mind, men who have no idea of becoming scholars, men who would be artists, 
mechanics, business men, as well as who have in mind the ministry or the law, 
may receive an education adapted to their needs and capabilities. That the doc- 
trine of individualism is beginning to be respected is evident from the establishment 
of scientific schools, technological schools, and from the high position which these 
schools occupy now side by side with the college, a position to which they could not 
lay claim even so short a time as ten years ago. But the same sin (for it is a sin 
against God and against man) is still committed in most of our institutions, even 
in those to which reference has been made. The individual is forgotten in the 
mass. In how many colleges is it the custom to take, as it were, a diagnosis of 
the mental constitution of each student similar to that which the physician makes 
of the body? It is not unusual in these days in connection with the work of the 
department of physical culture to have each man examined, the weak points of 
his body pointed out, and the principal exercises indicated which will help him. 
Is such a thing done for the mental constitution? The present college methods 
too often, compel failures, and it is more or less accidental that a man receives 
real and genuine help in his development. Why is it that so many men achieve 
marked success in life, in their profession, and in every line of business, who have 
never seen the inside of college halls? Because contact with men does for them 
what technical education is supposed to do for those who avail themselves of its 
advantages. The feeling against higher education which has existed is not with- 
oub some justification. A radical change is demanded—a change which shall 
shake to the foundations the educational structures that have been erected. 
Outside of a very few of our highest institutions of learning the cause of educa- 
tion in this country has been cursed by the failure of those in authority to recog- 
nize the principle of individualism in the work of instructors. I select two famil- 
iar examples. In the high schools, which are gaining rapidly in numbers and in  
-P-A-G-E-380
  1338 ; EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
efficiency, no attempt has been made to assign to teachers the work in which they 
are particularly interested. The man whose mind by nature is mathematical in 
its tendency is ordinarily asked to teach language or history. The woman whose 
whole soul is afire with interest in literature is compelled to do work in science or 
mathematics. Or worse yet, as happens in nine cases out of ten of our colleges, the 
same person is required to teach in three or more departments, to a greater or 
less degree distinct from each other, the chances being that in no one of the three 
has the instructor been afforded opportunity to do special work. Until within a 
short time this sin has been committed even in larger institutions. It is at this 
point that individualism passes into specialism and the connection between the 
two is close. The multiplication of the fields of knowledge makes necessary the 
cultivation of individuality, and it must be conceded that the very marked changes 
which have taken piace in the college field are due to the rapidly increasing 
recognition of this great principle. 
Progress in this particular has been slowest in the case of institutions them- 
selves. It has been a common idea that every newly founded institution should 
duplicate the work of those which have preceded it, and, as a consequence, with 
one or two notable exceptions, the higher institutions of our country are institu- 
tions of a single type. This means of necessity narrowness. It means more, inas- 
much as each institution tries to cover the same ground, and all the ground; the 
result is that no effort has anywhere been undertaken to establish a school which 
will allow thoroughness or depth. The college with no endowment, or endow- 
ment of $100,000, seeks to do the same thing which the institution with an endow- 
ment of millions finds it difficult to do. The technical school with no endowment, 
or $100,000 of endowment, seeks to cover every field of technological work. How 
much better it would be if institutions would cultivate individualism, the academy 
doing the work of an academy, and not that of a college; this institution devoting 
its strength and energy, so far as university work goes, to the development of 
departments of history and politics, this to the development of physics and chem- 
istry, this to the development of the biological sciences, this one to throwing all 
its efforts into the great field of electricity. But no; the lowest tenth-rate college 
announces courses in every department of human knowledge, and students are 
compelled in self-defense to dabble in everything rather than to work in a few 
things. Leaving individuality of curriculum, it is also true that almost nowhere 
is there cultivated individuality of spirit. There are perhaps four or five institu- 
tions in America in which there may be said to exist after years of culture an 
individual spirit. There is a Harvard spirit, a Yale spirit, a Princeton spirit, a 
Johns Hopkins spirit, a University of Virginia spirit. Where is there another 
institution individual in its character? Of young institutions much may not be 
expected; but that institution which has done work fifty years without exhibiting 
to the world in the character of its men a distinctive individuality has, in one 
important respect at least, failed to accomplish that for which it was founded. 
COORDINATION—THE ADJUSTMENT OF PARTS. 
In every scheme there are parts; and that these parts shall make a scheme or 
system, they must be adjusted to each other; they must be coordinated. I use the 
word now in its broader sense. Our educational work has divided itself into sec- 
tions. Each section must be so arranged as to fit into that which is above and 
below it as well as into that which is on each side of it. The arrangement, there- 
fore, is a complicated one, and perhaps we are not to be surprised that no satis- 
factory adjustment has yet been made. Both of the adjustments referred to are 
needed in the educational development of every individual as well as in the organi- 
zation of every institution. - 
In the case of an individual, we seem to-day to be in utter confusion so far as
-P-A-G-E-381
  IDEALS OF EDUCATIONAL WORK. 21339 
concerns the arrangement of the definite steps in his education. Omitting, for 
the sake of brevity, any consideration of the earliest periods, it is evident that 
the grammar school, the grade preceding the high school or academy grade, is 
organized in most of our State systems with special reference to making provision 
for teachers and finding a market for text-books rather than for developing chil- 
dren. Bewildered by the multiplicity of subjects taught, subjects making a 
curriculum without unity of any kind, the pupil reaches the end of this period dis- 
couraged and distressed. Why do not more children proceed to the higher grades 
of study? Partly, it is true, because of poverty, but in large measure, I maintain, 
because of the inefficiency of the organization of the grammar grade. z 
A few, comparatively. proceed higher, in spite of difficulties almost insurmount- 
able, compelled by parental authority or impelled by a desire for study which 
even the most disadvantageous circumstances will not destroy. Here, again, the 
same confusion reigns, not only in the high school, but in academies and prepara- 
tory schools. The connection between the work of this grade and that which 
precedes is not a logical one, and the various elements which ought together to 
form a plan at once unified and complete are thrown together in a most promis- 
cuous manner. The higher we go, the worse becomes the condition of things. 
Academies and high schools stand in no direct or indirect relation, except in indi- 
vidual instances, to the college work which follows. In the majority of schools 
the student finds upon graduation that he has not met the requirements for 
admission to college, and unable to go back and take up the work again in another 
form, he loses courage and gives up the effort. Still further, no connection of 
any kind exists between the college work and the professional. As a matter of 
fact, our professional schools are made up for the most part of men who could not — 
gain admission to the freshman class of the colleges. The man who has by dint 
of hard work carried himself through college finds himself in the professional 
school side by side with men who have never been inside of college, or, in many 
cases, of high school or academy. Yet these men work together, and some edu- 
cators tell us that it is profitable for both. What utter nonsense! The weakness 
of the situation is acknowledged openly by certain leading institutions, which have 
within recent years made strong effort in some way to adjust professional work to 
college work. But the adjustments can not be said to have proved satisfactory. 
So far as it concerns the individual, there is needed such an adjustment of parts as 
will allow him from the earliest age to the completion of his professional course 
to move forward without interruption and without the loss which invariably fol- 
lows transfer from one scheme to another, neither of which stands related to the 
other. The beginning of real university work isin the kindergarten. The day 
will come when this fact will be recognized. With a proper adjustment in the 
unity of arrangement, the time of at least three years could be saved to every indi- 
vidual who contemplates a college or professional course of study. When we con- 
sider the terrible cost of the present lack of adjustment, we are the more ready to 
consider propositions looking to the readjustment of the various disconnected 
parts. Itis here that Germany forges ahead of us, because of the close connection 
of the pupil’s work from the very beginning until he is ready to enter the univer- 
sity. Results are obtained which, from our point of view, seem almost incredible. 
It is here, also, that adjustment of the parts is just as essential for the sake of 
the institution, It is difficult to show what is meant without a chart. The dif- 
ference between the present situation and the ideal may be described roughly 
under the figure of a tree. We see before us the stump. Branches of different 
length and thickness are strewn about the stump. This material is, to be 
sure, most valuable and is available for use. But imagine, if you please, each 
branch assuming its former place in connection with the trunk of the tree; the 
sap once more flowing from the roots to the topmost limb; the foliage restored, 
and the fruitage. This isa fair representation of a system of education with its
-P-A-G-E-382
    1340 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
parts adjusted to each other. Or, better yet, since every institution should be in 
a proper sense such a tree, the assemblage of institutions forming the great system 
would be a magnificently planted grove, made up of a variety of trees, each the 
best of its kind, each contributing to the happiness and maintenance of mankind. 
The educational grove of America to-day consists for the most part of dismem- 
bered trunks, and these largely of the same species; most of them stunted in 
growth, a few here and there giving evidence of what might be under a different 
condition of things. 
A vital mistake in the history of education in New England has been the isola- 
tion of the academy from the college. A vital mistake in the history of education 
in the West and South has been the too close identification of the preparatory 
school and the college. The New England schools have been right in not permit- 
ting the academy to be joined closely with the college. They have erred in not 
securing direct control of the academies, in order that the step from the academy 
to the college might be taken without embarrassment and loss. Western and 
Southern institutions have done the right thing in recognizing the necessity of a 
close connection between the preparatory schools and the college, but have made 
the mistake of bringing the life of the preparatory school into too close connection 
with that of the college. There can not be a university without colleges. Nor 
can there be colleges without academies. The ideal institution will, therefore, 
cultivate the academic work as assiduously as any other, and will see to it that 
the connection between it and the college work is close and that the step from one 
to the other may be taken easily. The same principle would apply to the higher 
work. The future will see an adjustment made by which, after the first two 
years of a college course, the remaining work of the college shall be so closely 
connected with that of the professional school that the line between them will be 
drawn only with difficulty. Such an adjustment will be attended with two 
advantages. It will make all the more difficult any attempt to do professional 
work without an adequate training, and it will do much toward lessening the 
friction and loss of time which now invariably attend the passing from the college 
to the university. The more my mind dwells upon it the more adequately do I 
find the figure of the tree to express my conception of our educational work. The 
roots running out in the various directions constitute the earlier and preparatory 
stage of work. Students of every condition of life and mental attaihments are 
brought together in this period. The stock of the tree is the central or college 
period. The work of all students in this stage runs along much the same lines. 
It is here that the final testing takes place. Typical subjects are brought forward 
and the student led to grapple with them. The variety here is not great, nor 
should it be; but where this process has been complete, selection begins and divi- 
sion takes place. These divisions, as they move forward in a multitude of depart- 
ments, make the branches of the great tree. Here is infinite variety, infinite pos- 
sibility of development, yet everywhere the same characteristics. Because of the 
infinite variety, and because of the sameness of characteristics, adjustment of 
the parts is all the more necessary. 
ASSOCIATION, 
Finally, with your permission, I desire to present as an important characteristic 
of any adequate system, as a leading feature of the future work, the principle of 
association. This is a necessary concomitant of individualism and coordination. 
Association or combination is possible in case the student or instructor is treated 
as an individual, and in case an institution, of whatever grade, has aimed to 
develop individuality. It is a remark of frequent occurrence that one of the 
common features of our present civilization is the emphasis laid upon specialism 
in every line of work. It is also to be noted that, side by side with specialism,
-P-A-G-E-383
    IDEALS OF EDUCATIONAL WORK. 1341 
and because of specialism, another prominent feature of our modern civilization 
exists, namely, that of combinations and trusts, for it is only the specialists who 
combine. It was not until the day of specialism that combinations could occur. 
It is true that until individualism prevails association to any considerable extent 
must be postponed. Association implies coordination in both senses of the word. 
In order that men, either as students or professors, may come together, in order 
that institutions may cooperate, there must be a rigid classification according to 
the purpose, scope, and rank. It is here, probably, that the first radical steps in 
any educational reform must be taken. So long as institutions doing really the 
work of high schools call themselves colleges and universities there can be no 
association other than a merely nominal one. The high schools of some of our 
Northern and Western States do a work vastly superior in quality and greater 
in quantity than many of the so-called colleges and universities. 
Granting that these two principles have begun to operate at least slightly (and 
I think that every forward step taken during the past twenty-five years has been 
taken in accordance with these principles), there is opportunity—I may say there 
is necessity—for the working out of the principles of association or union of 
etfort or combination, by whatever name we may decide to designate. Naturally 
it must first come in the form of institutional association. 
The applications of this principle are so numerous that time will permit the 
mention of but a very few examples taken from a narrow field. As before, I pass 
over the lower grades. 
The association of academies in relation to a college: Each college should have 
in the district tributary to it as many academies as the constituency will support. 
These academies should be under a local management distinct from that of the 
college, and yet there should be such a connection as would permit the college “ 
in large measure to direct the work of the academy. This is what has actually 
taken place between the high schools and the State university in certain States. 
But it must be recognized sooner or later that the high schools do not make 
preparation for college their chief work. It must be remembered that only 10 
per cent of those who finish the high-school course ever enter college. The high 
school, therefore, has other work to do. The time will come when two-thirds of 
the present colleges and universities should, for lack of funds to do properly the 
work they are now trying to do, be made colleges of this same rank. 
When additional funds are secured, higher work may be undertaken; but not till 
then. The larger the number of colleges we can haye, the better, so long as they 
are equipped to do the work ofa college; but to make students believe that they are 
receiving a college education, to give them the degree which is supposed to stand 
for such an education, is a species of dishonesty and imposture for which there is 
no excuse and which our legislatures should take in hand. There will be, then, 
the academies and high schools, brought into vital relationship with the colleges 
which are nearest to them; the ‘colleges of lower rank and of higher rank—the 
two classes sharply distinguished. These in turn will be associated in relation to 
the university. The university of the future will make aclear distinction between 
its college work and its university work. There is room to-day for ten or fifteen 
universities. The colleges, remaining colleges and doing college work, will sus- 
tain to the university the relation sustained by the academies to the colleges. 
The association of colleges may be either that of a State, as is already true of the 
State of New York, or that of a denomination (the bond in this case being very 
close), or that of a district, such as New England, or the valley of the Mississippi. 
No one can fail to see the immense advantages of such an association. I may be 
permitted to go one step further. The universities, supposing the number to be 
ten, fifteen, or twenty, should, let me say, unite in a federation. This federation 
will be like that of the States of the Union. Through this federation of universi-
-P-A-G-E-384
ee eS a Ee ee Ne en gee gered re 2 1 
1342 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
ties will come the crowning feature of our American system—a national univer- 
sity. We do not need a national university as an institution, distinct from other 
institutions and their rival. The existing universities will never consent to a 
national university organized upon such a basis. The history of the movement 
: since the days of Washington demonstrates this. 
Let the institutions doing real university work unite, and let great scholars and 
investigators be delegated by each university to go to Washington, and, with 
governmental assistance, make proper use of the great scientific treasures of all 
kinds which have been there collected; these professors all the while being mem- 
bers of the university which has thus delegated them, and yet, as a body, consti- 
tuting the faculty of the national university. Let the students of all universities 
study at Washington whenever it is to their advantage to do so, remaining, how- 
ever, students of their own university. This plan is simple; it removes the whole 
matter from the field of politics; it can be introduced at a minimum of expense; it 
will lead to unity of effort; it will secure a system in our work, the lack of which 
all concede; it will not excite the rivalry of universities already established; it 
will permit the students to move about; it will set a standard by which institu- 
tions may judge themselves; it will secure an association of interests and a recog- 
nition of scientific work which will lift the work of education in this country to 
' the place it occupies in Germany. 
Individualism, coordination, and association are the keynotes to future prog- 
ress along educational lines.

TEACHERS’ MUTUAL-BENEFIT ASSOCIATIONS AND PENSION LAWS. 
This subject was treated extensively in the Annual Report of 1894-95, in an arti- 
cle entitled ‘‘Pensions to teachers.” The pension laws passed by some State 
legislatures, and the provisions made by municipal authorities for annuities, as 
well as the results of some mutual-benefit associations among the teachers in the 
large cities of this country, were quoted in that article. Since the printing of the 
report, Prof. John M. Pierce, of Boston, has published a summary of what is 
being done in this direction, which summary contains tables of interest to teach- 
ers in search of such information. That article appeared in the New England 
Journal of Education and is here reprinted: 
“The beginnings of this institution lie farther back than any organization, | 
beyond the reach of statistical inquiry. Members of the same vocation, while so 
often competitors for place and power, are at the same time most ready to sym- 
pathize with and aid each other. What begins as brotherly charity, where the 
material benefit is all on one side and the spiritual benefit all on the other, devel- 
ops into a business organization, where the benefits are mutual. 
“One of the least systematic and organized ways of giving aid is through asso- 
ciations formed for other purposes. Teachers’ clubs and societies for general pro- 
fessional purposes sometimes apply a part of their funds to the aid of sick and 
needy teachers, and, in case of death, to bury them. Louisville, Ky., has no aid 
association. ‘Two-thirds of the teachers belong to the Louisville Educational 
Association; the annual fee is $1; this furnishes a fund of $300 annually, with 
which assistance is given to such teachers as may be confined to their homes by 
serious illness when they have no other means and call for aid. This work is 
managed by a board of control, who report in a general way, without giving 
names. The teachers of Louisville have discussed many plans for a better system, 
but have reached nothing definite. 
“While such a method is commendable from a charitable point of view, it spits 
the giving of aid on such a basis that it must often defeat its purpose. Many 
teachers would suffer the most extreme need rather than call for assistance under 
such circumstances. 
“The Teachers’ Club of Jersey City, N. J., maintains a fund out of which mem- 
bers who are incapacitated through illness receive a weekly benefit, 
“The Teachers’ Aid Association of Chicago, which was organized after the great 
fire, aids those who through sickness or other causes become needy and without 
the means of support; whenever necessary, the teachers have voluntarily con- 
tributed a certain fractional percentage of their salaries for one month to this 
1343
-P-A-G-E-386
  1344 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
relief fund. It is four years since any contribution has been made to this fund, 
and during that time $1,000 has been paid out to teachers in need. 
‘There are doubtless other cities where work like this is done; these things are 
not always considered worthy of being reported. But in most of our large cities 
there is some more elaborate and systematic method of teachers’ aid. 
“Table I embraces the associations that pay sick and death benefits to members 
without waiting for them to plead inability. The beneficiary receives aid as 
insurance for which he has paid. 
‘“‘The tendency in this kind of association is to furnish a number of benefits, and 
to multiply the dues accordingly. The oldest of these, that of Baltimore, isa good 
illustration of this. Besides the sick benefit, a stipend is paid to the family or heirs; 
if there is no one to claim this, it is to be applied in paying the funeral expenses. 
To raise this amount, a special assessment of $1.10, besides the initiation and 
annual dues, is made upon each member, the 10 cents to cover expense of notifica- 
tion. When the amount in the treasury falls below $500, an extra assessment of 
$1 is levied on each member. 
“These associations for sick and death benefits do not usually accumulate large 
funds, since they pay out frequently in small sums. They generally aim to pay 
about $1 per day to teachers who are sick long enough to lose their salary. Man- 
aged as they are, these associations could not afford to have a large, continuous 
list of beneficiaries, and so the time during which sick benefits will be paid, or the 
amount of benefit, is limited. 
“The idea of retiring teachers on an annuity is a later thought. It arises only 
where the profession is more fixed. In some cities, both kinds of associations exist 
side by side. But where an association for temporary aid only already exists, it is 
more common for the teachers in such city to apply to the State legislature to have 
a retirement fund established by law. Experience with a voluntary association is 
likely to lead to the demand for something more uniform and universal. 
‘*Of Table II the Boston association was incited by the example of New York, 
and was in general modeled after this. The Teachers’ Annuity Guild of Massa- 
chusetts was in turn copied in essentials from the Boston plan. The guild is in 
some features an improvement over the other associations, having their experience 
to begin with. The guild is composed of teachers in cities and towns near Boston. 
Cambridge, Haverhill, Lowell, and Somerville are the cities having the largest 
numbers of members. 
“When an association is organized, it is found advisable for a few well-known 
and reliable persons to associate themselves, make their plan, and then invite 
members on that basis. In this way the Boston association and the annuity guild 
were formed. In Providence the matter was discussed in town-meeting style, and 
so many were the wants to be satisfied that several years were lost in coming to 
any agreement. 
“The chief diversity of object is between temporary aid or sick benefits, and 
permanent aid or annuity. The difference is a relative one, for a spell of sickness 
may be prolonged into permanent incapacity. Most of the associations in Table 
II might be put into Table III, since they permit one who has been retired on 
account of disability to be taken off the list of annuitants when restored to health, 
and to become an annuitant again if again incapacitated. The annuity system 
_could be worked to cover sick benefits, but in most cases this is not the intention 
of its promoters. In Cincinnati and Philadelphia the annuity may be enjoyed 
temporarily during prolonged sickness. New York, Boston, and Baltimore have 
not been put into this table, not because their organization is essentially different 
from that of Cincinnati and Philadelphia, but rather on account of a difference in | 
the spirit of working. Those in Table II donot appear to favor the use of aunuities 
to include sick benefits,

“The Brooklyn association pays in cases of sickness at the discretion of the 
board of trustees. 
“The association of the District of Columbia, including Washington, has a 
unique way of giving both temporary and permanent aid. There are two classes 
of members, Class A and Class B. The funds are kept in three separate accounts; 
the permanent and the annuity fund are administered for the benefit of Class A 
exclusively; the temporary disability fund for Class B exclusively. Teachers 
may thus enjoy either the temporary or the permanent benefits, or both, in the 
one organization. 
«These associations, included in Tables I, II, and III, are, from their nature, nec- 
essarily voluntary. They thus lack an element of strength and stability which 
some of the organizations authorized by law possess. Table IV shows the extent 
to which the State pension fund has been established, In St. Louis, California, 
and New Jersey membership is not compulsory; in Detroit, Chicago, and Cincin- 
nati it is compulsory; in Brooklyn and New York City, compulsory only on teach- 
ers appointed in the future. One of the chief advantages of an association estab- 
lished by law is lost when membership is not binding upon all teachers. "Whether 
the Illinois or the New York plan is better must depend on the stand taken by 
the teachers; the latter is practicable, where opposition would defeat the former.”

1350 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
COEDUCATION, 
The report of the Commissioner for 1894-95 summarized the latest information 
respecting the policy of educating the youth of both sexes in the same classes. 
(Report 1894-95, Vol. I, pp. 115-118.) No material change has since taken place 
in respect to this policy either in the United States or in foreign countries; but 
from constant inquiries received at this office touching the effect of cceducation 
in superior institutions, inquiries emanating chiefly from the Southern States, it 
is evident that there is a disposition to extend the practice in this country. For- 
eign educators also show great interest in the effects of this system as practiced 
among us. The actual state of the schools of the United States in this respect 
remains as stated in the previous report. In theelementary or public schools boys 
and girls are educated together. The only exceptions to this rule are found ina 
few cities, less, apparently, than 6 per cent of the total number. Even in these 
cities separation seldom takes place below the high school. Considering private 
schools, it appears that coeducation is the policy in nearly two-thirds of the num- 
. ber, and that these enroll a little more than two-thirds of all the pupils in private 
schools. As to higher institutions—i. e., colleges and universities—65 per cent of 
the number reporting to the Bureau are coeducational. 
a The most important event of the year, which has at least an indirect bearing 
upon the progress of coeducation in universities, is the appointment of a syndicate 
by Cambridge University (England) to consider the proposition of admitting 
- women to degrees. It is seventeen years since the question of granting degrees 
to women was first brought formally before the university, although the equiva- 
lent examinations were informally opened to women as early as 1872. The 
application of 1880 resulted in the certificate system, and the question rested 
until the present year. In March, 1896, the senate, in answer to a largely signed 
memorial, resolved to appoint a ‘‘ syndicate” to consider anew the question of 
admitting women to degrees. The syndicate accordingly nominated by the coun- 
cil was rejected on the ground that it contained too large a proportion of persons 
favorable to the contemplated change. In May a new syndicate was nominated, 
which was accepted by the senate. This action has renewed the discussion of the 
higher education of women in England, and particularly of the attitude of the 
older universities toward the problem. London, Victoria, and Durham univer- 
sities admit women to degrees, and a majority of their affiliated colleges are 
~ - coeducational. Under the law of 1892, authorizing the admission of women, the 
Scotch universities have become virtually coeducational. Edinburgh, St. Andrew’s, 
and Aberdeen have opened their science and art classes to women. At Glasgow, 
Queen Margaret College has been transferred to the university, which appoints 
professors and lecturers. Some of the classes are mixed, and are held in the 
university; the remainder are held separately in Queen Margaret College. 
COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
The year under review is made memorabie in the history of school legislation 
by the passage of the first compulsory law in the Southern division of the coun- 
try, Kentucky having taken the initiative in this important movement. 
As this matter goes to press similar action is reported from West Virginia and 
Indiana, whose laws are dated, respectively, February 20, 1897, and March 8, 1897. 
Thus thirty-one States have made legal provision for enforcing school attendance. 
The Kentucky law makes 7 to 14 years the age for compulsion, agreeing in this 
respect with the laws of Illinois and Wisconsin. The minimum annual term is 
eight consecutive weeks, the lowest recognized under any State law. The pen- 
alty for violation of the law is a fine of ‘‘not less than five dollars nor more than  
-P-A-G-E-393
  
  COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 1351 
twenty dollars for the first offense, nor less than ten dollars nor more than fitty 
dollars for the second and every subsequent offense, and costs of suit.” 
It is further provided that ‘‘Any person having control of a child, who, with 
intent to evade the provisions of this act, shall make a willfully false statement’ 
concerning the age of such child, or the time such child has attended school, shal 
forfeit for each offense a sum not less than five dollars nor more than twenty dol- 
lars, for the use of public schools for such city, town, or district.” 
All fines imposed under the law are to be placed to the credit of the public 
schools in the respective city, town, or district. It is specifically stated that the 
provisions of the act ‘apply to any parent, guardian, or person having control a: 
any colored child or children.” 
In addition to the usual conditions exempting parents and guardians from the 
operations of the law on the ground of the physical or mental disability of a child, 
the lack of school provision, adequate private instruction, etc., is that of satisfac- 
tory evidence that ‘‘the parent, guardian, or person having control is not able, 
by reason of poverty, to clothe such child properly.” 
Under the law of West Virginia, the compulsory age is 8 to14 years, making 
thirteen States in which these are the limits. The annual term of compulsory 
attendance is sixteen weeks, as it is in six other States. An offense under the law 
consists ‘‘in failure to send to school any child or children for five consecutive 
days, except in case of the sickness of such child or children, or other reasonable 
excuse,” and the penalty isa fine not exceeding $5. A local-option feature is intro- 
duced in the following clause: ‘(If sixty per cent of the legal voters of any city, ‘ 
independent district, or subdistrict shall petition the board of education against 
the enforcement of this act, the said act, so far as that subdistrict is concerned, 
shall be null and void until the beginning of the next school year.” Fines imposed 
under this law are to be placed to the credit of the building funds of the Tesvecay 
districts. 
The Indiana law creates a truant service, without which a compulsory law i is 
little more than a dead letter, and as a logical sequence to this service makes 
explicit provision for the care and restraint of incorrigible children. In respect 
to this and several other provisions the law may be regarded as the embodiment 
of an advanced conception of public responsibility in respect to the young, and as 
such is here cited in full: 
AN ACT concerning the education of children. 
[H.10. Approved March 8, 1897.] 
SEcTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, That 
every parent, guardian or other person in the State of Indiana, having control or 
charge of any child or children between the ages of eight and fourteen years, shall 
be required to send such child or children to a public, private or parochial school, 
or to two or more of these schools, each school year for a period of at least twelve 
(12) consecutive weeks in each school year: Provided, That any and all children 
that have completed the first eight years of work of the common schools of the 
State of Indiana and have received certificates of graduation from the common 
schools shall be exempt from the provision of this act: Provided, That children 
who are physically or mentally incapacitated for the work of the common schools 
are exempt from the provisions of this act; but the school authorities shall have 
the right and duty where such exemption from the provisions of this act is claimed 
by any parent, guardian, custodian or child, to cause an examination of such child 
by a physician or physicans employed for such purpose by such officers, and if 
such physician, or physicians, hold that such child is capable of doing the work 
ae ee common schools, then such child shall not be exempt from the provisions 
of this act. 
Sec. 2. It shall be the duty of the County Superintendent ‘of Schools for town- 
ship, and of the City Superintendent of Schools ina city or town, together with 
the Secretary of the State Board of Charities and one member of the State Board 
of Education designated for such purpose by said Board, to appoint one or more 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  1352 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
truant officers, not exceeding five in number in any county, who shall be assigned 
to duty by districts composed of townships. The truant officer shall see that the 
provisions of this act are complied with, and, when from personal knowledge or 
by report or complaint from any resident of the township or townships under his 
supervision, he believes that any child subject_to the provisions of this act, is 
habitually absent from school, he shall immediately give written notice to the 
parent, guardian or custodian of such child that the attendance of such child at 
school is required, and if within five days such parent, guardian or custodian of 
child does not comply with the provisions of this section, then such truant officer 
shall make complaint against such parent, guardian or custodian of such child, in 
any court of record, for violation of the provisions of this act, and any such par- 
ent, guardian or custodian of child who shall violate the provisions of this act, 
shall be adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be 
fined in any sum not less than ten nor more than fifty dollars, to which may be 
added, in the discretion of the court, imprisonment in the county jail not less 
than two nor more than ninety days. 
Szc. 3. For every city or incorporated town it shall be the duty of the Superin- 
tendent of Schools of such city or town, together with the Secretary of the State

TRANSPORTATION OF CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. 13853 , 
THE TRANSPORTATION OF CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. 
This subject was treated in a chapter of the preceding report of this office,! in 
which were given the laws of the States which had provided for the transportation 
of pupils, the experience of the States and communities that had adopted the 
practice, especially Massachusetts, and statements respecting its advantages and 
disadvantages. 
Legislation. 
In the chapter referred to Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Con- ° 
necticut were given as the States that had made definite legal provision regarding 
the matter in question. To these may now be added New York, Maine, New Jer- 
sey, and Nebraska. 
The New York law (1896) is as follows:? 
Whenever any district shall have contracted with the school authorities of any 
city or village or other school district for the education therein of the pupils resid- 
ing in such common-school district, the inhabitants thereof entitled to vote are 
authorized to provide, by tax or otherwise, for the conveyance of the pupils resid- 
ing therein to the schools of such city, village, or district with which such contract 
shall have been made, and the trustees thereof may contract for such conveyance 
when so authorized in accordance with such rules and regulations as they may 
establish. 
The provision of the Maine law (approved March 26, 1897), after reciting the 
conditions under which schools may or must be discontinued (the latter when 
the average attendance falls below eight), goes on to say: 
The superintendent of schools in each town shall procure the conveyance of all 
public-school pupils residing in his town to and from the nearest suitable school — 
for the number of weeks for which schools are maintained in each year, when 
such pupils reside at such a distance from the said school as to render such con- 
veyance necessary. 
A New Jersey law of 1894 provides as follows:* 
When in any district there are children living remote from the schoolhouse, and 
who are unable on that account to attend such school, such district may order 
raised by special district tax an amount of money sufficient to enable the board of 
education to transport such children to and from the school, under such rules and 
regulations as may be deemed necessary by the board of education of such dis- 
trict; * * * the total sum expended for the purpose of transporting such chil- 
dren shall not exceed the amount ordered to be raised for said purpose. 
By a Nebraska law, approved April 14, 1897, it is enacted: 
SEcTION 1. That a board of education of a city, or aboard of trustees of a high- 
school district, by a two-thirds vote of the entire board, or a district board of any 
school district in this State, when authorized by a two-thirds yote of those present 
at any annual or special meeting, is hereby empowered to make provision for the 
transportation of pupils residing within said district to any other school [within 
said district] to which said pupils may lawfully attend, whenever the distance 
from such school shall render it impracticable for said pupils to attend without 
transportation. £ 
Src. 2. That a board of trustees of a high-school district, or a district board of 
a school district in this State, when authorized by a two-thirds vote of those present . 
at any annual or special meeting, is hereby empowered to contract with the dis- 
trict board of any neighboring district for the instruction of [all] pupils residing 
in the first-named district in schools maintained by the neighboring district, and 
to make provisions for the transportation of said pupils to the above-named school _ 
of the neighboring district, under the conditions named in the preceding section. 
Other States.—The State superintendents of Rhode Island and Wisconsin have 
declared that the existing provisions of the school laws of their respective States 
are sufficient to authorize the conveyance of pupils at the public expense, though

the former intimates the desirability of more specific legislation upon the subject; 
as a matter of fact, some progress has already been made in Rhode Island in this 
direction. Certain counties in Ohio are authorized by special laws to establish 
central schools and convey pupils to and from them. Some beginnings have been 
made in Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and perhaps other States, where there 
already exists, as in Pennsylvania, ‘‘ law enough to cover the case.” 
The following extracts will serve to exhibit the status of the transportation 
question in a number of States: 
Pennsylvania. 
[From report of State Superintendent Nathan C. Schaeffer, 1896.] 
: At the first State directors’ convention held in Harrisburg during the month of 
January, one of the leading topics discussed was the transportation of pupils to 
graded schools at central points, the saving of money, and the improvement of the 
instruction effected thereby. Ata few places the experiment has been tried with 
marked success. Public sentiment, bad roads, and geographical obstacles render 
impossible at this time any general adoption of the plan. But under the agitation 
now going on at farmers’ institutes, the public roads will be improved. In 
enlightened communities public opinion is soon changed in favor of any plan which 
either saves money or improves the schools. From the province of Victoria in Aus- 
tralia comes the report that 158schools were closed by this plan, and that after deduct- 
ing the cost of conveyance the saving amounted to $50,000 perannum. The minister 
of education says that the system is a marked success, and if there is one feature 
as to its working that stands out more prominently than another, it is the remark- 
able regularity of the attendance of the children conveyed. * * * In several 
of the New England States which have tried the same experiment, the land in 
remote districts is said to have risen in value instead of depreciating in the mar- 
ket, as had been predicted by those opposed to the closing of the schools near their 
own farms. The whole question, however, is beset with many difficulties inso- 
much that directors will. do well to weigh most carefully all the considerations 
involved before they decide to abandon any of the schools now in operation. 
Ohio. 
[From report of State Commissioner Oscar T. Corson, 1896.] 
As the State grows older the country-school problem increases in both impor- 
tance and difficulty of solution. In some localities the sparseness of the popula- 
tion becomes a very important factor in its consideration, and in such localities, 
proyided the roads are good, the true solution is no doubt found in the conveyance 
of the children to and from a central school. Special laws, authorizing boards of 
education to establish such schools in Lake and Geauga, Cuyahoga, Ashtabula, 
Stark, and Portage counties, already exist, and the plan is no longer an experi- 
ment. 
One of the first schools established under this special legislation is located at 
Kingsville, Ashtabula County. The schools in that locality, under the old plan, 
were very small, and therefore necessarily very expensive from the standpoint of 
either the per capita cost or the results attained. Under the new plan of consol- 
idation, which has been in operation nearly four years, several of the outlying 
districts were abandoned and the pupils conveyed to the school at the center of 
the town in wagons specially provided for the purpose. The expense of schooling 
the children has thus been reduced nearly one-half, the daily attendance has been 
very sareely. increased, and the quality of the work done has been greatly im- 
roved. “ 
= What is true of Kingsville is in a large measure true of other localities in Lake, 
Geauga, and other counties to which the special legislation is applicable, and the 
plan is worthy of the earnest attention and study of all who are interested in the 
welfare of the country schools. In other localities different hindrances, such as 
the lack of educational sentiment, neighborhood quarrels, no organization, selfish- 
ness of directors, etc., make the problem a difficult one. Such hindrances can be 
overcome only by developing in such communities a better school sentiment.

  TRANSPORTATION OF CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. 1355. 
the two superintendents who have been most prominent in the work. This recent 
movement, may have an interest for some minds that earlier movements would 
not possess. 
1. Extracts from the report of Mr. F. E. Morrison, superintendent of Kings- 
yille, Ashtabula County: 
The new school system, which is known as the Kingsville system of education, 
has been formulated and introduced with marked success. 
By this system the pupils of the subdistricts are given the same advantages for 
obtaining an education as the village pupils, and this result has been obtained 
without working any disadvantage to the village pupils, for we have been enabled 
to open anew room and supply another teacher in the village schools, thus reduc- 
ing the number of grades in each room and giving all the pupils better school 
advantages. We have sufficient room yet for several more pupils without crowd- 
ing the rooms. 
The pupils of the subdistricts have not only been given the advantage of more 
extended associations and larger classes with which to recite, but they have also 
the advantages of a school where the teacher has fewer recitations and can give 
more time and attention to each recitation. Thus the pupil’s progress is much 
more rapid than is possible in a school where there are three times as many classes 
and one-sixth the number of pupils. It is a fact that the work of the teacher 
depends more upon the number of classes to recite than the number of pupils in 
attendance. It is a pleasure indeed to note that the attendance in the subdistricts 
that have availed themselves of the new system has increased from 50 to 150 per 
cent in some cases and a larger increase in all cases; the daily attendance in the 
same subdistricts has increased from 50 or 60 per cent to 90 or 95 per cent, thus 
increasing greatly the returns from the school fund invested. This has been 
accomplished at a saving of more than $1,000 to the taxpayers in the three years. 
The board of education and citizens of Kingsville are to be congratulated for 
their progressive and energetic spirit in being pioneers in formulating and placing 
in operation a system of education superior to any in the State of Ohio, and which 
is to be the system of the future. The board of education has been enabled, 
under the new school law, to conduct its financial matters by better business 
methods, buying its supplies in quantities and letting its contracts on competitive 
bids, and by centralizing the schools, thus saving many needless expenses. 
Since the schools were centralized the incidental expenses have decreased from 
$800 to $1,100 per year to from $400 to $600 per year. All other expenses have also

In giving these figures we have deducted the $600, with interest, which was bor- 
rowed in 1889 and has been paid during the past three years. 
It should be mentioned also that the permanent improvements made by the board 
of education during the past three years are nearly double the amount made dur- 
ing the preceding three years. 
2. Extracts from the report of Mr. J. R, Adams, superintendent of Madison 
Township, Lake County: 
In my report to the board one year ago I called attention to the very low aver- 
age attendance in some of our schools, the great expense per capita of educating 
the pupils in those small schools, and to the fact that, on account of the lack of 
interest and enthusiasm therein, good results could not be obtained, and suggested 
the plan of consolidation as the proper solution of the difficulties. 
Acting upon my suggestion, the board, having in view only the best interest 
of the children for whom our schools exist, voted to consolidate three subdistricts
-P-A-G-E-398
  1356 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
at North Madison, No. 16 and No. 8 with No. 12, and also three at Unionville, No. 
10 and No. 11 with No. 4, arrangements being made with the school board of 
Harpersfield Township whereby the pupils of subdistrict No. 1 of said township 
might attend the school.at Unionville upon payment by the board of education of 
Harpersfield to the board of education of Madison Township the sum of $140 
tuition. 
Our school opened with 2 teachers and with an attendance of 93 pupils. This 
was certainly more than the number for which we had planned, and was a great 
surprise to me, for from No. 10, in which subdistrict there had been the previous 
year an attendance of only 10 pupils, there came 18; from No. 11, in which there 
had been an attendance of only 8 pupils, there came 18, and from the Harpersfield 
district, in which there had been an attendance of 14pupils, there came 23. The 
number of pupils enrolled in this school was 107, with an average attendance of 73. 
Having tried the new plan for a year it is no longer an experiment, but an expe- 
rience with us. Therefore let us now candidly look at the results. First, I wish 
you to know what the patrons of the consolidated school think of the plan, and 
then to give you, as briefly as I can, some of my own observations. All the patrons 
in the school of subdistrict No. 10 of Madison and in subdistrict No. 1 of Harpers- 
field have signed a paper stating that they are well pleased with the plan and its 
results, and asking their respective boards to continue the plan another year. 
While there has been no canvass at Unionville, subdistrict No. 4, to ascertain 
what the people there think of the plan, yet, from what I have heard, I am confi- 
dent that they are unanimous in its support. The foregoing represents the 
opinion of patrons who send 89 of the 107 pupils to this school. A large majority 
of the patrons in subdistrict No. 11, who send 18 of the 107 pupils to the school in 
question, have publicly expressed themselves as being dissatisfied with the plan, 
and that under it their children have not received the educational advantages 
which they ought to have received. Further comment is unnecessary. 
Following are some of the good results which have come under my personal 
observation: 
1. A much larger per cent of enumerated pupils enrolled. 
2. No tardiness among the transported pupils. 
8. Irregular attendance reduced, the per cent of attendance of transported pupils 
from two subdistricts being each 94 per cent, the highest in the township. 
4, Pupils can be better classified and graded. 
5. No wet feet or clothing, nor colds resulting therefrom. 
6. No quarreling, improper language, or improper conduct on the way to and 
from school. 
7. Pupils under the care of responsible persons from the time they leave home 
in the morning until they return at night. 
8. Pupils can have the advantage of better schoolrooms, better heated, better 
ventilated, and better supplied with apparatus, etc. 
9. Pupils have the advantage of that interest, enthusiasm, and confidence which 
large classes always bring. 
10. Better teachers can be employed, hence better schools. 
11. The plan insures more thorough and complete supervision. 
12. It is more economical. Under the new plan the cost of tuition per pupil on 
the basis of total enrollment has been reduced from $16 to $10.48; on the basis of 
average daily attendance, from $26.66 to $16.07. This statement is for the pupils 
in said subdistricts Nos. 10 and 11. 
13. A trial of this plan of consolidating our schools has satisfied me that it is a 
step in the direction toward whatever advantages a well-graded and well-classified 
school of three or four teachers has over a school of one teacher with five to eight 
grades, and with about as much time for each recitation as is needed to properly 
assign the next lesson. 
Iam now more thoroughly convinced than ever before that consolidation, or 
centralization, as it is sometimes called, is the true solution to the country-school 
roblem, 
m Ina private letter of recent date Mr. Adams says since his report was made 
consolidated schools have been established at two other points in Madison—at one 
place four schools, at the other three, each with two teachers. This makes five 
in the township (which is a very large one, owing to the ‘‘ gore” on the lake). 
Five teams are employed to transport pupils, at a cost of about $1.a day for a 
team. Every conveyance carries about 18 pupils. There is no trouble in trans- 
porting the pupils, even the youngest, 3} miles, which is the greatest distance. 
In 1895 there were 18 schools in Madison, with an average attendance of 217; in 
1896 the number was 14, with an average of 260; this year there are 10 schools, 
with an average that will reach over 300, The total expense will be about the

same in this township as under the old plan, but the cost per pupil will be much 
less. Mr. Adams adds that the new plan is rapidly growing in the neighborhood, 
and the belief is spreading that the new system is sure to prevail generally in. 
northeastern Ohio. 
3. The following advertisement well illustrates the care that is taken in Madison | 
township to secure suitable transportation for school children:

The expense for the transportation of pupils is $91,186.11, or $14,527.82 more than 
lastyear. This indicates that the process of consolidating feeble schools—a process 
that is in the interest both of economy and of efticiency—is still going on. _ It costs 
$576 to pay the teachers, let us suppose, of three rural schools $8 a week for six 
months, or twenty-four weeks—the minimum legal period. If these three schools 
have but8 pupils each, they can be united into a single school of 24 pupils. A 
teacher of higher qualifications can be secured for from $12 to $15 per week. The 
E cost of the.school for six months will be from $288 to $360, and there will bea mar- 
gin of from $288 to $216 for transportation. The building, the janitor service, the 
_ grading of the pupils, the teaching, the school spirit—nearly all those things that 
contribute to a good school—should be distinctly better, and, in general, are better, 
as a result of such consolidation. (Mass. Sch. Rep., 1895-96, p, 87.)

  Reports showing the extent to which temperance-instruction laws are enforced, the 
trend of opinion, ete. 
[State Agent George A. Walton, in Massachusetts School Report, 1895-96. ] 
Physiology and hygiene.—In his sixth annual report, for 1841-42, Horace Mann 
made an extended and forcible plea for the teaching of physiology in the schools. 
His early institute addresses put emphasis upon this as an essential branch of 
instruction. The study was pursued in all the normal schools—in earlier years 
for a knowledge of the subject, in later years both for this and the method of 
teaching it. It has lent itself especially to the objective or laboratory method. 
The subject had been taught only to a limited extent in elementary schools 
under a permissive act of 1872, till the enactment of the law of 1885, which made 
it a compulsory study. 
This law was advocated especially to give an increased knowledge about the evil 
effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics on the human system. Since 
the passage of the act increased attention has been given to the teaching of the 
subject in all grades of the schools, as required, but it has failed to enlist that 
hearty interest on the part of either pupils or teachers to which it is entitled. 
This is owing to many circumstances which environ the subject. There are real 
friends of temperance who doubt the wisdom of directing the attention of young 
children to the structure and functions of their bodily organs; they question, too, 
the utility, if not the possibility, of making critical analyses of alcohol or of nar- 
cotics with young pupils, to show their effect upon the blood and nerves and tis- 
sues of the living human organism. They believe that the whole subject, in its 
more technical aspects, should be deferred till after the pupil has received some 
instruction in chemistry and kindred sciences and has attained considerable power 
of forming independent judgments through his own reflection. An effort to com- 
pel instruction to be given by means of text-books, and to have these used from 
the earliest grades, has met with opposition on pedagogical grounds; no subject, 
it is said, can be properly taught in this way. 
On the other hand, the advocates claim that no instruction would be received 
by the mass of the children leaving school at an early age if the study was deferred 
to an advanced grade, and that the teachers generally are not qualified to give 
instruction in this subject without text-books. There are real difficulties to be 
overcome, as there have been in teaching other branches. Thé remedy will be 
found in giving to all teachers proper professional training for teaching all 
branches and by inspiring them with the vital importance of this. 
By such means as have been brought to bear upon the teachers by the law com- 
pelling them to qualify themselves for the teaching, and upon the children by the 
kind of instruction hitherto given, there is a growing interest in it and an increase 
of knowledge which must be of lasting benefit to the coming generation. Ibelieve

the subject is really receiving as much attention in the schools as any subject ever 
receives in so brief a time as has elapsed since the passage of the compulsory law 
for teaching this branch. 
[State Superintendent Charles R. Skinner, of New York, 1895-96.] 
Instruction in physiology and hygiene.—The legislature of 1896 amended the act 
of 1895 providing for instruction in ‘‘ the nature of alcoholic drinks and other nar- 
cotics” for four lessons per week for ten weeks in each year, by reducing the 
amount of instruction to three lessons per week for ten weeks “‘or its equivalent.” 
By this amendment, thirty lessons given during a,school year comply with the 
requirements of the law. ‘TheState superintendent of publicinstruction isrequired 
by the act of 1896 to include in his annual report astatement showing every school, 
city or district, which has failed to comply with all the provisions of the act dur- 
ing the preceding school year. All reports made to this department by local 
officers contain affidavits showing that the law has been complied with. While 
difficulties have been found in complying with the strict letter of the statute, itis 
very evident that teachers and school officers throughout the State are cheerfully 
endeavoring to meet the spirit of the law. No complaint or appeal has reached 
the department that the law has been violated. Itis gratifying to note that dnrng. 
the year much misunderstanding and misrepresentation have been removed, an 
it seems to be generally understood that the attitude of the department has never 
been antagonistic to instruction which teaches the importance of temperance as a 
personal virtue and a social benefit. 
Mr. F. P. Peirce, one of the school commissioners of Oneida County, reports: 
** Physiology has been taught, according to the provisions of the statute, in all 
schools. To say that its effect is either good or bad, would presume a too intimate 
acquaintance with each individual. There are, however, startling and widely 
known. examples of bad results from the present method of teaching the subject.” 
[State Superintendent Heury Sabin, in Iowa School Report, 1894-95.] 
Eyery county superintendent reports that in the county institute he gave the 
subject the consideration which the law requires. The secretaries for the difter- 
ent school boards report that the law is generally complied with in the graded 
schools of the State, as well as in all the schools in the country districts. 
As far as the letter of the law is concerned there is a general compliance with its 
provisions. Not that there are no exceptions. There are some districts in which 
the most conscientious teacher, owing to complications beyond her control, finds 
it difficult to decide what course should be pursued. In regard to what precise 
method the teacher is to employ, thelawis silent, as it should be. .The term scien- 
tific temperance instructionis misleading. The aim should not be alone to implant 
in the mind of the child a vivid idea of the evils of intemperance, lest that which 
we hold up as a warning may become, first, an impression, and afterwards a hideous 
growth. There must be something more than this. 
The chief aim in temperance instruction should be to convince the child that the 
only path to happiness or success lies through a lite of temperance and sobriety. 
A high ideal of a noble life, like a beautiful picture on the wall of a room, is an 
ever-present, all-powerful influence for good. 
The law itself is one in which the spirit far overshadows the letter. Unless the 
instruction given reaches the heart and convinces the judgment, it fails of its pur- 
pose. The boy is not greatly benefited by the instruction given in the school if, 
after reciting his lesson upon the ruinous effects of tobacco upon his system, and 
perhaps before he leaves the schoolhouse yard, he lights his cigarette and smokes 
it on his way home. 
This law, as well as the one forbidding the sale of tobacco to minors under 16, 
isvery wholesomein its tendency. Suchlaws, however, add new and grave respon- 
sibilities to the teacher's office. That some teachers fail to appreciate this is due 
simply to human nature, That others fail to appreciate the fact that precept is 
futile when not supported ‘by practice is pitiable. On the whole, we believe the 
teachers in our schools are anxious to do their duty in observing this law. If 
parents, in many cases, were as watchful as the teachers, and as willing to make 
sacrifices, if necessary, in order that their children might be taught habits of sober- 
pee and temperance, the work of temperance instruction would be much more 
effective. 
[State Superintendent H. R. Corbett, of Nebraska, 1895-96] 
Temperance instruction.—The subject of physiology and hygiene, with special 
reference to the effects of alcohol and narcotics, receives special attention in the 
new course of study. 
 
-P-A-G-E-403
    TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 1361 
The teachers of Nebraska are heartily in sympathy with the spirit of the law 
providing for such instruction. Whenever such teaching is neglected, it has usu- 
ally been due to a lack of definite outlines and directions. Great care has been 
taken to supply this need in the new course. 
[State Superintendent W. W. Pendergast, of Minnesota, 1895-96.] 
Stimulants and narcotics.—That the law providing for regular and systematic 
instruction in physiology with special reference to the effect of stimulants and nar- 
cotics upon the human system has been generally observed, is evidenced by the 
fact that but one complaint has been made to the department during the past year. 
It is nevertheless true that in many districts it is honored ‘‘more in the breach 
than in the observance.” The attention of teachers is called to their duties in the 
matter at institutes and summer training schools and in teachers’ associations and 
examinations held by county superintendents. Most of them are in cordial sym- 
pathy with the object of the law, and enter into the work with alacrity and a sin- 
cere desire to carry out its provisions conscientiously and faithfully. Much good 
has already been done, and there is apparently no opposition to it. 
[State Superintendent Emma F. Bates, of North Dakota, 1895-96.] 
Scientific temperance.—There are some, but not many, exceptions to compliance 
with the provisions of this law in the letter. The spirit of the law is not always 
fulfilled as it might be. 
The child may be taught scientific facts about alcohol and narcotics and be no 
more helped thereby in his conduct in life than by the knowledge he has of scien- 
tific facts in geology. The aim should be to so teach him that he will desire to 
refrain from allinjurious habits. Next, having the right desire, he must have the 
properly disciplined will power to execute his desires. 
We believe that the teachers as a rule do the best they can with the knowledge 
and appliances and conditions at their command to fulfill this law in letter and 
spirit. We urge, however, a greater effort on their part to inculcate the principles 
that will lead the child to a life of temperance and pure living. School directors 
might well supply needed aids in the line of literature for instruction on this 
subject. 
[From the report of the Committee of Twelve on Rural Schools—Appendix M, by A. P. Marble.] 
Physiology is now required by law to be taught in the schools of nearly all the 
States. As too frequently taught, it concerns itself about the chemical effects of 
certain substances upon various parts or processes of the body. Such a treatment 
of the subject is too abstruse for children in the schools; it goes beyond their 
knowledge and their experience. Theyneed to be taught the effect of green apples 
upon the stomach before they are taught the effect of alcohol upon the brain. We 
ought to learn wisdom from the concrete teaching of nature about eating green 
apples in her monitory pains. People mean well when they teach the evil effect 
of alcohol to little boys and girls who do not know what alcohol is. It would be 
better to teach these children the good effect of wholesome food and drink, and 
especially to teach them that the whole alimentary canal should be kept in healthy, 
regular, and daily movement throughout, and to teach this and all that relates 
to the necessary bodily functions with delicacy and propriety and without any 
squeamishness. Is any teacher too delicate, cultured, and refined a lady or gen- 
tleman to give this instruction concerning the bodies of the children? Then let 
them be relegated to the land of spirits, to teach where the mortal coil has been 
shuffled off. It is high time to inaugurate a campaign of hygiene, and not the 
least important branch of child study is the study of their bodies, and how those 
bodies may be made in school to grow strong, robust, healthy, natural, at ease— 
‘*the temple of the living God.” 
[From Bulletin of the Department of Labor, No. 8—January, 1897.] 
Crime.—During the twelve months covered by the investigation, there were 
26,672 convictions for various offenses, of which 17,575, or 65.89 per cent, were for 
drunkenness, and 657, or 2.46 per cent, for drunkenness in combination with 
other offenses. In 21,863 cases, or 81.97 per cent, the offender was in liquor at the 
time of committing the offense. Taking only the cases in which drunkenness did 
not form part of the offense, or 8,440, there were still 3,640 cases, or 43.18 per cent, 
in which the offender was in liquor at the time the offense was committed, and 
4,852 cases, or 57.49 per cent, where the offender was in liquor at the time the 
intent was formed to commit the offense. 2

In response to the inquiry whether the intemperate habits of the criminal led to 
a condition which induced crime, an affirmative reply was made in 22,514 anda 
negative reply in 4,142 cases, the facts being unknown in sixteen instances. Dis- 
regarding the cases in which drunkenness was a factor, there remain 4,294 out of 
8,440 cases of conviction for other crimes, or 50.88 per cent, in which the intem- 
perate habits of the criminal led toa condition whichinduced the crime. In 16,115 
out of 26,672 cases of conviction for crimes, including drunkenness, the criminals 
reported that the intemperate habits of others were influential in leading them to 
a condition which induced crime. In 217 cases this information was lacking. 
Taking only the 8,440 cases of conyiction for crimes other than drunkenness, it is 
found that 3,611, or 42.78 per cent, attributed their condition to the influence of 
the intemperate habits of others.

ART DECORATIONS IN SCHOOLROOMS.! 
   
     
   
     
    
    
       
    
       
       
     
    The first notable effort to encourage the decoration of schoolrooms seems to have 
en made in Boston, Mass., in 1870. Charles C. Perkins and Prof. John D. Phil- 
‘ick were the prominent leaders in the movement. They began their experiment 
placing casts of antique sculpture in the girls’ normal and high school building 
West Newton street, Boston. The suggestion had been made two years before 
a member of the educational committee of the American Social Science Asso- 
ation, and had been approved ‘‘as a simple but efficient; means of introducing an 
isthetic element into the educational system of the United States.” The hall of 
e new building had been arranged with reference to this purpose, and with the 
meurrence of the school committee the plan was successfully carried out. The 
sts, in addition to most of those of the frieze of the Parthenon, which were 
rranged as a frieze of the hall, comprised ten statues. Among them were the 
lenus of Milo, the Demosthenes, the Diana of Gabii, and the Pudicita of the Vati- 
m. Eleven antique busts were put in position around the hall. These casts 
ere bought in London, Paris, Rome, and Boston. The total cost, including 
portation, was about $1,500, which was met by private subscriptions. The sig- 
ficance of this movement is emphasized by the fact that it was only in 1870 that 
e Boston Museum of Fine Arts was incorporated, while its collections were not 
ened to the public until some years later. Besides a few casts of antique sculp- 
re possessed by the Athenzeum, there was then no similar collection open to the 
ople of Boston. 
The French and English have made similar efforts. In 1881 areport on the sub- 
ct of art in schools was presented to the French minister of public instruction. 
‘bout that time a similar report was made to an English institution in London, 
which Mr. John Ruskin was president, and Mr. Matthew Arnold, Sir Frederick 
leighton, and other eminent men, vice-presidents. The object of this association 
as ‘‘to bring within the reach of boys and girls in our board and other schools 
ch a measure of art culture as is compatible with their age and studies.” They 
oposed, therefore: (1) to negotiate with art publishers for the purchase of 
ints, photographs, etchings, chromo-lithographs, etc., and to supply them at 
e lowest possible price to schools; (2) to reproduce carefully selected examples 
at were likely to have a large circulation; (8) to print a descriptive cata_ 
gue and price list of the éxamples which the committee were prepared to 
commend to the notice of schools; (4) to present to schools, as the funds of the 
sociation would allow, small collections and books explanatory of them; (5) to 
range loan collections to be placed at the disposal of schools on such terms as 
ight prove convenient; (6) to bring together a number of examples to be exhib- 
ed in a suitable place as a tentative model of a standard collection, This model 
lection was to consist of: (1) Pictures of the simplest natural objects—birds and 
eir nests and eggs, trees, wild flowers, and scenes of rural life, such as town

children seldom see and country children often fail to enjoy consciously until the 
attention is specially called to them; (2) pictures of animals in friendly relatic 
with human beings, especially children; (3) pictures of the peasant and artis: 
life of our own and foreign countries, incidents of heroic adventure, -etc.; (4) pi 
tures of architectural works of historic or artistic interest; (5) landscapes and s 
pieces; (6) historical portraits; (7) scenes from history; (8) such reproductions ; 
were available of suitable subjects among the numerous works of Italian, Dutel 
and modern schools. The report of this committee as outlined is comprehensiy 
and practical. It includes both elementary and superior instruction and propos 
to use pictorial illustrations for the purpose of familiarizing town and city bri 
children with country scenes as well as to attract the attention of children to ti 
direct observation of nature. ! 
Tn America, although the proposal of 1870 by Professor Philbrick and Mr. Pe 
kins brought no immediate results, the subject was not forgotten. In a report 
the committee on drawing of the Boston school board for 1883 Mr. Perkins, tl 
writer of the report, makes reference to the desirability of forming an “art f 
schools association” based on the French idea of 1881. The committee goes on 
say that ‘‘ although we can not ask the cooperation of the school board in our pr 
posed effort to found an art for schools association in Boston, yet we believe th 
the decoration of schoolhouse walls with good prints and photographs will n4 
only bring good influences to bear upon the pupils, mt will also material. 
aid teachers of drawing, history, geography, and natural history as objects 
reference.” 
It was not until May 20, 1892, however, that the organization of the Boston Pu 
lic School Art League was actually accomplished. Its creed is love of art; that 
may be more widely known and more highly appreciated, ‘believing that ai 
refines the mind, enriches the heart, elevates the soul, that art is one of the sa 
tials of the perfect life, and that the refinement which sn from the presence 
an association with works of art is an important element and aid in the develo] 
ment of character, both mentally and morally.” 
Its aim is ‘‘(1) by daily contact with objects of art to bend, educate, and el 
vate the mind of the young to familiarity with, liking for, and due appreciati 
of things beautiful (not necessarily useful) and correct standards in the art 
architecture, painting, and sculpture, and the lives of those who have made t! 
arts noble, to the end that children of the present generation may, when th 
come to man’s estate, reject the false, demand the true, and so raise the art of o1 
time and country to a plane which will, in ages yet to come, reflect true greatne: 
and not material aggrandizement; (2) to place upon the walls of schoolroo 
objects of art in the shape of casts, photographs, engravings of statuary, buil 
ings, and paintings, illustrating recognized standards in art; also art centers, 
Athens, Rome, Florence, Venice; also portraits of the old masters; also origin: 
works by leading artists, foreign and American. We believe this movement 
decorate our schoolrooms is worthy the sympathy and support of all our citie 
The end can be gained through legacies and gifts of worthy objects of art by in 
viduals for general distribution or special use, and by donations of money f 
specific purposes, such as the decoration of rooms marked for memorial or histo) 
ical interest.” 
The league, although restricted by the lack of means, began its work of decor: 
tion with tworooms. Room No. 4 of the English High School was made a Rom: 
room, and there were placed in it photographs of the Arch of Constantine, ti 
Temple of Vesta, the Coliseum, St. Peter’s, exterior and interior; casts of t 
busts of Cesar, Virgil, Marble Faun, Eros, Cicero; consoles supporting casts

the same design as those for a similar purpose in the Vatican; the national flag; 
the State flag. In Miss Biglow’s room in the Rice Primary School were placed 
portraits (prints) of Longfellow, Whittier, Bryant; engraving of Columbus at the 
Court of Ferdinand*and Isabella; engraving of Pharaoh’s horses; casts of boys’ 
heads, by Donatello; cast (panel) of dancing boys, by Della Robia;-cast of 
Houdon’s bust of Washington; the national flag; the State flag.1 This good 
beginning has met with favor from others. In 1893 the head master of the Girls’ 
High and Latin schools was authorized to accept for these schools in behalf of 
the city eighteen framed photographs representing ancient Greek monuments 
and works of art, presented by Mr. J. M. Rodocanachi.? There are now two 
“memorial” rooms in Boston. One is a room in the Latin school, dedicated to 
the memory of John Witt Randall, a great-grandson of Samuel Adams, and very 
appropriately the photographs and casts illustrate the period of the Revolution. 
The other memorial room is the hall of the Horace Mann School. 
The school report of Cambridge, Mass., for 1892 enumerates a long list of pic- 
tures, portraits, views, and statuary given to the various schools of that city by 
friends (pp. 214-227). The list will be of value to others who desire to make up 
lists of pictures for the adornment of schoolrooms. 
It has also called the attention of the various graduating classes to the value of 
gifts which they may be able to make to the schools. Thus the class of 1894 of 
the Roxbury High School presented to that institution a framed photograph of the 
Castle of St. Angelo, at Rome, a bust of Hermes, colossal size, and a cast of the 
Trojan shield. The committee of the board said it gave them ‘great pleasure to 
commend the excellent taste and judgment displayed in the selection of these gifts, 
and to recommend their acceptance by this board.”* In the same way the alumni 
association of the public schools of Haverhill, Mass., made a gift of three casts and 
two photographs to their school in 1895.4. The ninth grade of the Barnum School, 
of Bridgeport, Conn., placed in the south corridor of that building in 1894 an heroic 
size plaster cast of the statue of Minerva Giustiniana, at a cost of $57.5 
Brookline, Mass., reported in 1895 works of art placed in the Lawrence School 
by the ladies’ art committee. Mr. William H. Lincoln also provided for the hall 
of the Lincoln School a number of reliefs and casts as follows: Frieze of the Par- 
thenon; bas-relief from the Greek temple at Pergamos, representing the battle of 
Minerva with the giants; statue of Minerva, Augustus, Urania, bust of Marcus 
Aurelius, Julius Cesar, Cicero, Demosthenes, Homer. Again, in 1896, Brookline 
reported a gift of $1,000 from Mr. George W. Armstrong which was to be expended. 
for works of art for the high school, besides various gifts of pictures, photographs, 
and busts (p.6). The superintendent of city schools, Mr. Samuel T. Dutton, says: 
“The work of placing works of art in the schoolrooms of this town has been in 
progress now [1896] for nearly four years. About four years ago a public day 
was held at the Lawrence School, and at the close of the exercises the parents and 
friends were invited to meet in the-hall, when the subject of art decoration was 
proposed tothem. A committee was at once formed, and money was raised by 
means of entertainments and contributions until nearly $1,000 was available for 
the purpose. * * * [These pictures are arranged in different rooms according 
to the subject, and a list of the whole has been published.] About one year ago 
our new high school was opened, and we have already had donated to that school 
pictures and casts to the value of more than $2,000. The most important feature 
of this collection is, perhaps, the Armstrong collection of casts. These are all 
placed in a large room which is exclusively devoted to the subject of art. Com-

mittees have been appointed, in connection with two other schools, to continue 
this work. We have also a committee on art, in connection with our education 
society, which will probably undertake to place art works in those schools so situ- 
ated that the patrons are unable to do anything. In this way we hope within a 
reasonable time to have a good representation of masterpieces in all our schools. 
Imay add that we have gone far enough in this undertaking to satisfy ourselves ~ 
that the presence of beautiful pictures and impressive statues in our schools is a 
distinctive educational factor. They help to elevate and ennoble the atmosphere 
of the school, give dignity to the place, inspire the teachers, and react impres- 
sively upon all who enter the room. When it comes to be understood that the 
schoolroom is to be made as pleasant and well furnished as the model home, ee 
the school is likely to take the place it should hold as a social factor.” * * 
The Medford High School has done work along the same line. Some nee has 
been raised by subscription for the interior decoration of the new school building, 
and a fund of $5,000 was given for its exterior decoration. This school recently 
published [1896] a catalogue of 172 pictures, busts, bas-reliefs, portraits, and trans- 
parencies, with their location in the building and descriptive notes. The list 
includes classical busts and pictures, views of buildings and natural scenery, por- 
traits of eminent men, and historical pictures, American and European. 
Over 200 works of art have been presented to the Faulkner School, of Malden, 
Mass., by nearly as many persons. The same work is being promoted in Spring- 
field, Mass. According to the report of the Springfield Republican of November 2, 
1896, a scheme was on foot to advance the interests of art decoration by a series 
of lectures. 
Efforts are being made also in Chicago, Denver, San Francisco, and in Milwaukee, 
where the Public School Art Association is at work raising $5,000 for this purpose. 
Oakland, Cal., New York, Brooklyn, Providence, New Haven, and Philadelphia 
have collections of photographs and casts. 
At Quincy, Mass., Mr. W. G. Corthell, acting on the principle that ‘it is poor 
economy to put before the accustomed view of children what is poor, mean, and 
paltry,” furnished at his own expense one of the rooms of the Wollaston School. 
At Thanksgiving the friends of the school were invited to inspect the room. His 
motives were expressed in the invitation, as follows: 
‘* First, to inspire the scholars to a greater love of the beautiful, without which 
life at its best is only a drudgery. We are all more or less molded by our environ- 
ment. Pictures of the noble men of history and the stately works of art wrought 
by the world’s great masters stimulate the youth to the highest achievement in 
patriotic and faithful work. The scholars, by becoming accustomed to see what 
is high and pure in art, will unconsciously absorb its influence and learn to appre- 
ciate that which elevates and ennobles our lives. The result will be better work 
at their hands all through life, whether that work be at the bench, in the mart, or 
in the forum.” 
So well was Mr. Corthell pleased with the reception of his venture that he took 
it upon himself to find forty-three others who individually would make at least 
one contribution from a list that had received the sanction of Ross Turner, the 
artist, who has devoted his energies to the movement. The forty-three have been 
found, and soon the room will be ready for public inspection.! 
The following extracts from the reports of various cities show that there is a 
general interest in the subject under discussion, and that towns and cities are 
reaching out after something more than they have now.

   Our respected townsman, Mr. Ross Turner, the artist, may well be called the 
ipostle of public school art decoration. With the aid of a number of our fore- 
ost citizens and the approbation of the school board, Mr. Turner has started in 
e public schools of Salem a movement destined to be generally introduced into 
e schoolhouses throughout the country and to exert an important influence upon 
ur systems of public education. The movement began in the Phillips school- 
ouse, where at first one room was properly fitted up, the walls tinted in a quiet, 
rayish tone, soft and agreeable to the eye, thus forming a good background, 
here were hung engravings, photographs, and solar prints of some of the most 
mous pictures of the world. A circular was issued, prepared by Mr. Turner 
nd signed by a committee of five gentlemen, calling for contributions to extend 
work thus begun. Meantime the matter was brought to the attention of the - 
hool board, who gave it their formal sanction and encouragement, and Mayor 
antoul cordially commended it in his annual address. 
From this beginning in one room the work has been gradually extending until 
ew decorations are found in nearly all the schoolhouses of the city. The walls 
re tinted and. hung with engravings and prints, while over the doors and above 
e blackboards are bracket shelves, upon which and upon pedestals by the 
de of the teachers’ desks are casts and busts of famous men, representations of 
jas-relief groups, and such like sculptures. The plan contemplates the orna- 
entation in this way of the schoolrooms of all grades in the city. These works 
art are selected and grouped simply upon artistic principles. It is proposed to 
ave portraits of statesmen, heroes, authors, and men otherwise illustrious in his- 
ry and setting great examples for youth; pictures of buildings representing 
lotable architectural work and structures celebrated in history. Pictures of kin- ¥ 
ired associations are brought together as much ‘as possible in the same room. 
‘hus in one room will be pictures of Venice, in another of Rome, and in another 
lorence. A picture of Sir Walter Scott will have one accompanying it of Melrose 
bbey. A large photograph of the Mansion House at Mount Vernon, 6 or 7 feet 
ng, will have near it a fine full-length figure of Washington. * * * 
The portraits are usually glazed, but the other pictures, such as are 5 or 6 feet 
ng or more, are not covered with glass, because it would be cheaper to replace 
em when soiled than to go to the expense of glazing. Accompanying each pic- 
ure isaplacard, plainly printed in large letters, giving its title and a few important 
cts concerning the subject. 
We may all well agree with Mr. Turner when he says that he ‘believes that 
e future of art in this country depends not so much upon the patronage and 
preciation of the comparatively few who have means and leisure as upon the 
ltivation of good taste among the great mass of the people, made possible 
rough a familiarity with beautiful and artistic things.” By beautifying the 
rrounding of the children in the schoolroom, they would thus become accus- 
med to what is good and true in art; they would unconsciously absorb its 
fluence, and they would inevitably learn to appreciate true art almost intui- 
vely. The result necessarily must be better architecture both in public build- 
gs and in the homes of the people, and the exercise of a better taste in the 
bellishments of the same. The influence of these pictures and this statuary 
vill inevitably tend to broaden the knowledge the children will acquire in their 
leography and history, stimulate their love for these studies, and ina marked 
legree influence their patriotic appreciation of our own country. : 
The supervisor of drawing in Salem says on this subject in the report for 1894: 
“It is to be earnestly hoped that the good work of schoolroom adornment so * 
ecessfully begun by Mr. Turner will be continued in the city. There are still 
o many bare walls and unattractive surroundings. The silent teaching of beau-

‘tiful forms and colors is of inestimable value in education. The schoolroom 
should be a place where the tired teacher finds it not unrestful to sit even when 
her duties do not hold her there. We want more color, more cheerfulness; not 
many things in the room, but harmony” (p. 23). 
[rom School Report of Somerville, Mass., 1892, pages 26-28.] 
There is a great movement in New England, and other sections also, in the 
direction of art education by means of the decorative and artistic finish of school 
buildings. The architect and artist are exercising their silent but potent influ- 
ence upon the minds of the public-school pupils. The Journal of Education thus 
describes the work of Mr. Ross Turner and the Public School Art League: 
“The first step was to place in the schoolroom—after explaining his desire and 
plans to the school officials, whose consent was gladly given—a number of his 
‘private paintings and works in plaster, whatever, in effect, would add beauty and 
an artistic atmosphere to the school home. When this had been done, it was an 
easy matter to interest others, especially those whose children were in the public 
schools. * * * A circular was issued January, 1892, inviting citizens to its 
inspection. As a result of the interest thus created, the committee has been 
enabled to adorn several other rooms in this building and to make a beginning in 
other schools. 
“The Public School Art League of America was formed in the hope of unifying 
this movement, giving it strength, and aiding those who might otherwise have to 
undertake the work alone. 
“The purpose of this movement is to place school children during their forma- 
tive years among beautified surroundings, so that while at their studies they may 
unconsciously absorb the influence of what is good in art and learn to distinguish 
the good from the bad. With the growth of a generation whose taste had been 
thus developed, we would have a public holding higher standards for all their sur- 
roundings. * * * 
“The artists have already gone much more than halfway in giving an impetus 
to this movement. It is for the teachers to meet them and do all that can be done 
to help it on. To no one can it possibly mean so much as it will to the teachers. 
Others are working for succeeding generations, for humanity embodied in young 
America.” 
[From Report of School Committee of Lawrence, Mass., 1893, pages 8-10.] 
We hold that a love for the beautiful is, perhaps, second only to religion as a 
protection against the grosser forms of self-indulgence, and that it can best be 
kindled at an age when the mind is especially susceptible to the influence of 
habitual surroundings, 
The decoration of schoolhouse walls with good prints and photographs will 
bring good influences to bear upon the pupils, and will also materially aid the 
teachers of history, geography, and natural history, as objects of refer- 
ence. *. 2% % 
Brookline, Milton, Salem, and Quincy have school buildings that have been so 
beautified, adorned, and enriched by photographs, engravings, and casts that the 
whole life of teachers and the taught has been made broader and sweeter. By the 
help of these things they have been living on the heights, and, having lived) 
together there for a season, having formed a taste for works of art that treat of 
great historical events, or of nature in her sublimity and grandeur, they have been 
silently the recipients of an educational influence that is good, and only good. 
It costs but little to place these things where the children may see them every! 
day. Pictures with which well-educated children should be as familiar as they) 
are with the multiplication table can now be obtained at so little expense that

   they will come into our schools in greatly increasing numbers as soon as we are 
more fully persuaded that they are most powerful helps toward that refining influ- 
lence and that strong character building that are among the chief functions of the 
lpublic school. 
Parents have a right to expect that along with increase of knowledge in arith- 
metic and history, in addition to better penmanship and greater power in oral 
reading, there shall be increase in refinement and growth in good conduct. 
The teacher who is obliged to instruct surrounded by four barren walls is at a 
tremendous disadvantage in all these higher lines of influence. 
Some of our schools are supplied with a limited number of good pictures. In 
ithe hall of the Oliver School, besides the portrait of General Oliver and the paint- 
fing of the Landing of the Pilgrims, there are two large pictures that were pur- 
hased more than twenty years ago by Mr. Walton with the proceeds of an enter- 
ainment given by his school. 
For a score of years these have made the Oliver hall more attractive to the 
hhousands who, as pupils, parents, and friends, have been drawn thither by edu- 
ational duties or interest. Every room through the whole Oliver Building ought 
(0 be made more attractive by a supply of good pictures. 
The hall of the Packard School has been made cheerful and homelike by the 
ictures received from prizes, by gifts from the graduating classes, and from 
riends of the school. * * * 
At the Essex School the cooperation of teachers and pupils has provided some 
xcellent works of art. At this school the rooms are designated as the Greek room, 
she Roman room, the Venetian room, etc., and the pictures have been placed in 
ccord with the assignment of names. 
[From Annual Report of School Committee of Pittsfield, Mass. , 1895, pages 55, 56.] 
The desirability of making schoolrooms attractive has long been recognized, and 
ost schoolrooms have on their walls pictures and other decorations of more or 
less value, according to the ability of the donors and the standard of taste pre- 
ailing in the school. While all of these evidences of a regard for better things 
re to be respected for the motive that has prompted them, the results sometimes 
how the importance of art education. The indiscriminate use of cheap mottoes, 
lippings from illustrated newspapers, drawing exercises, advertising cards, 
osters, and the like for wall decorations is to be commended only as an evidence 
f good intentions. So far as the appearance of the room is concerned, bare walls 
re to be preferred. I am glad that very little’ of this sort of decoration is to be 
‘ound in Pittsfield, and that any that may exist is not of recent date. On thecon- 
rary, some of our schoolrooms are fairly supplied with reasonably good pictures, 
nd there is a desire on the part of teachers and pupils for more and better works 
f art in our schools. During the past year we have added to our desirable 
ictures The Court of the Lions in the Alhambra, at the Center School; The 
‘iber and the Church of St. Peter at Rome, in the Orchard Street School, and a 
opy of the Sistine Mother and Child, at the Pontoosuc School. There was also 
laced in the Linden Street School a cast of The Winged Victory. These were 
rocured by the efforts of the teachers and pupils, and plans are on foot for other 
cquisitions of the same sort. The beautiful gift to the Pontoosuc School was in 
emory of Miss Kelly, the late principal, and was largely due to the generosity 
f the patrons of that school. 
I have encouraged the desire for works of art of a higher order not merely for 
he sake of having the schoolrooms more attractive, but because it is a very effect- 
ve means of refining and elevating the character, the taste, and the manners of 
he pupils. More than this, each child has an influonce in the home and in the 
ommunity, and in due time this influence will determine the character of the

city. This view of the matter would seem to justify some expenditure for thi 
purpose from the annual appropriation. The teaching of driwing and music in 
our schools and the expenditure for music and decorations as a feature of gradu. 
ation exercises must be justified largely on the same grounds. In view of thg 
general interest shown by our teachers and pupils in maintaining a good record 
of attendance, I believe that a small appropriation for desirable pictures to be dis: 
tributed to the schools and schoolrooms making the best attendance records for 
each month or for the entire year would be one of the best possible educationa’ 
investments of the small amount required.

something to please the eye, to cultivate the taste, to stimulate and to satisfy thd 
mind’s many and many-sided needs. There could be typical examples of natura! 
animal, vegetable, and mineral products—specimens of manufactured articles 
There could be portraits of the men who have made our history, men distinguished 
in every field of usefulness. There could be photographs of wonderful natural 
features and phenomena; of historic places and buildings; of masterpieces in archi 
tecture, painting, and sculpture, and of the mighty achievements of mechanica: 
skill and engineering. There could be drawings to show the elements of beauty 
in form, and to illustrate harmony in color combination. With such, the whol¢ 
atmosphere of the schoolroom would be changed. Stimulated by such, the pupil 
would breathe in more easily the spirit of patriotism, would the better understan 
himself and his environment. Becoming more familiar with the good, the beau 
tiful, and the true in man and in nature, he would unconsciously imitate. There 
would be awakened within him truer and higher standards of life and living, an: 
he would thereby be the better enabled to judge between the true and the fals 
in circumstance, between the right and the wrong inconduct. The foundation oi 
error has for its corner stone ignorance. Error easily becomes criminal throug! 
“unenlightened will. Such surroundings as these would awaken and cultivat 
admiration—admiration for that which is worthy of it. ‘It is by admiration onl; 
of what is beautiful and sublime that we mount up a few steps toward the like. 
ness of what we admire.”   [From Report of Board of Education of Omaha, Nebr., Public Schools, 1895, page 12.]

RUSKIN ON THE DECORATION OF SCHOOLROOMS. 
Before this question had been agitated by Mr. Perkins and Professor Philbrick, 
John Ruskin had written as follows on the subject: 
Hitherto, as far as I know, it has either been so difficult to give all the educa- 
tion we wanted to our lads that we have been obliged to do it with cheap furniture 
in bare walls, or else we have considered that cheap furniture and bare walls are 
a proper part of the means of education, and supposed that boys learned best when 
they sat on hard forms and had nothing but blank plaster about and above the: 
whereupon to employ their spare attention; also that it was as well they shoul 
be accustomed to rough and ugly conditions of things, partly by way of preparing 
them for the hardships of life and partly that there might be the least possible

          mage done to floors and forms in the event of their becoming during the 
aster’s absence tlfe fields or instruments of battle. All this is so far well and 
ecessary as it relates to the training of country lads and the first training of boys 
general. But there certainly comes a period in the life of a well-educated 
outh in which one of the principal elements of his education is, or ought to be, 
ic give him refinement of habits; and not only to teach him the strong exercises 
which his frame is capable, but also to increase his bodily sensibility and refine- 
ent and show him such small matters as the way of handling things properly 
nd treating them considerately. Not only so, but I believe the notion of fixing 
he attention by keeping the room empty is a wholly mistaken one, I think it is 
lust in the emptiest room that the mind wanders most; for it gets restless like a 
ird for want of a perch, and casts about for any possible means for getting out 
nd away. And even if it be fixed, by an effort, on the business in hand, that 
usiness becomes itself repulsive, more than it need be, by the vileness of its 
ssociations; and many a study appears dull or painful to a boy when it is pur- 
med on a blotted deal desk under a wall with nothing on it but scratches and 
egs which would have been pursued pleasantly enough in a curtained corner of 
is father’s library ‘or at the latticed window of his cottage. Nay, my own belief 
that the best study of allis the most beautiful, and that a quiet glade of a 
forest, or the nook of a lake shore, is worth all the schoolrooms in Christendom 
hen once you are past the multiplication table; but be that as it may, there is 
o question at all but that a time ought to come in the life of a well-trained youth 
hen he can sit at a writing table without wanting to throw the inkstand at his 
eighbor, and when also he will feel more capable of certain efforts of mind with 
eautiful and refined forms about him than with ugly ones. When that time 
lomes, he ought to be advanced into the decorated schools, and this advance ought 
be one of the important and honorable epochs of his life. 
I have not time, however, to insist on the mere serviceableness to our youth 
f refined architectural decorations as such; for I want you to consider the 
rofitable influence of the particular kind of decoration which I want you to get 
r them, namely, historical painting. You know we have hitherto been in the 
abit of conveying all our historical knowledge, such as it is, by the ear only, 
ever by the eye; all our notions of things being ostensibly derived from verbal 
escription, not from sight. Now, Ihave no doubt that as we grow gradually 
iser—and we are doing so every day—we shall discover at last that the eye is a 
obler organ than the ear; and that through the eye we must in reality obtain or 
ut into form nearly all the useful information we have about this world. Eyen 
s the matter stands, you will find that the knowledge which a boy is supposed to 
ceive from verbal description is only available to him so far as in any underhand 
ay he gets a sight of the thing you are talking about. I remember well that for 
any years of my life the only notion I had of the look of a Greek knight was 
lomplicated between recollection of a small engraving in my pocket Pope’s Homer 
nd a reverent study of the Horse Guards. And though I believe that most boys 
lollect their ideas from more varied sources, and arrange them more caréfully 
an I did, still, whatever sources they seek must always be ocular. If they are 
ever boys, they will go and look at the Greek vases and sculptures in the British 
useum and at the weapons in our armories; they will see what real armor is 
kke in luster and what Greek armor was like in form, and so put a fairly true 
mage together, but still not, in ordinary cases, a very living or interesting one. 
Now, the use of our decorative painting would be, in myriads of ways, to ani- 
ate their history for them, and to put the living aspect of past things before 
eir eyes as faithfully as intelligent invention can, so that the master shall have 
othing to do but once to point to the schoolroom walls, and forever afterwards 
he meaning of the word would be fixed in the boy’s mind in the best possible way.

It is a question of classical dress—what a tunic was like, or a chlamys, or a peplus 
At this day you have to point to some vile woodcut in the middle of a dictiona: 
page, representing the thing hung upon a stick; but then you would point to 
hundred figures, wearing the actual dress, in its fiery colors, in all actions o! 
various stateliness or strength; you would understand at once how it fell aroun 
the people’s limbs as they stood, how it drifted from their shoulders as they went} 
how it veiled their faces as they wept, and how it covered their heads in the da; 
of battle. Now if you want to see what a weapon is like, you refer, in like man| 
ner, to a numbered page, in which there are spearheads in rows, and sword hilt: 
in symmetrical groups; and gradually the boy gets a dim mathematical notio 
how one scimiter is hung to the right and another to the left, and one javeli: 
has a knob to it and another none, while one glance at your good picture woul 
show him, and the first rainy afternoon in the schoolroom would forever fix in hi: 
mind the look of the sword and spear as they fell or flew, and how they pierced, o: 
bent, or shattered—how men wielded them and how men died by them. 
But far more than all this is it a question not of clothes or weapons, but o: 
men? How can we sufficiently estimate the effect on the mind of a noble youth| 
at the time when the world opens to him, of having faithful and touching repr 
sentations put before him of the acts and presences of great men? How many 
resolution which would alter and exalt the whole course of his inner life migh 
be formed when, in some dreamy twilight, he met, through his own tears, th: 
fixed eyes of those shadows of the great dead, unescapable and calm, piercing t 
his soul, or fancied that their lips moved in dread reproof or soundless exhort: 
tion. And if for but one out of many this were true; if yet in a few you could 
sure that such influence had indeed changed their thoughts and destinies, an 
turned the eager and reckless youth, who would have cast away his energies o1 
the race horse or the gaming table, to that noble life race, that holy life hazar 
which should win all glory to himself and all good to his country, would not tha 
to some purpose, be ‘ political economy of art?’ 
WORK OF THE MANCHESTER ART MUSEUM. 
At a session of the International Conference on Education held in London i 
August, 1884, a paper on this subject was read by Mr. T. C. Horsfall, from whic! 
extracts are presented herewith. This address confirms the observations alread: 
made by teachers, that in many cases the children of the poorer classes in citie: 
who live in small and cramped tenements, or in narrow, filthy streets, have n| 
conception of the common everyday scenes and events of the life of the countr: 
child. This ignorance is confined to no one city or country. Thus, Mr. Horsfal 
illustrates his plea for pictures by saying that in English cities some of the chi’ 
“ dren scarcely know what a flower is like or have ever seen a primrose or a viole 
some thought a squirrel was a bird; others that the berries of the mountain as! 
were roses; others that a dragon fly was a bird or a serpent; and some did not kno 
what a lamb was like. Mr. Horsfall says: 
“T believe that the right use of works of art in elementary schools will effe 
an improvement in the taste of English work people and employers, which all pei 
sons conversant with English manufactures know to be very desirable; that it wil 
reveal to many children who live in the crowded parts of large towns some of t! 
highest qualities of their own nature and that of their fellow-creatures, of ti 
existence of which most such children, and many also of those who live in plea: 
anter places, are not aware; that it will soon make the homes of many work peopl 
more attractive than work people’s homes generally are now, and will do muc 
toward creating a fuller and happier family life amongst the work people of town: 
by opening to them many pleasant occupations and amusements which paren 
and children can enjoy together, and which will therefore create between paren’

           and children the bonds of common interests and pleasures; that it will make 
schools more attractive for children, and add to the brighter side of the culture 
of teachers, and, while making their work pleasanter, increase their influence 
over their pupils. 
“«Two conditions are needed for the development of good taste in a person who 
has the qualities needed for its acquisition. One of these conditions is that from 
childhood onward he shall habitually see beautiful things; and the second con- 
dition is that in childhood and youth people whose opinions he respects shall make 
him notice the difference between beautiful and ugly things, and make him feel 
that they regard beauty as a thing of great value. 
“It is impossible to insist too strongly on the dependence of good taste on the 
lexistence of these two conditions. The coexistence of both is quite necessary. 
'The second can not, of course, exist, unless the first does also; but the first exists 
for many persons without the second, and then exists for most of them in vain, so 
far, at least, as development of taste is concerned. All children in the country 
habitually see beautiful natural forms and colors, but this does not suffice to 
make most of them even perceive the difference between good and bad form and 
olor ae te 
“Tt is only in schools that we can hope that most children can be enabled at 
present to habitually see beautiful things and feel the influence of persons respected 
iby them, who, perceiving the difference between beautiful and ugly things, can 
lead the children to feel that beauty is a thing of great importance. Pictures are 
amongst the beautiful things needed for this purpose in schools. * * * 
“As the committee of the Manchester Art Museum have lately been taking the 
course Which seems to me to be that needed for gaining all the advantages obtain- 
ble by the use of pictures in schools, I will describe their system. First, I must 
peak of the system of their central collection, that of the art museum, to which 
s many references as possible are made in labels attached to the pictures lent to 
chools. 
“The art museum which was opened last month by Mr. Mundella, contains as 
any pictures as we can find room for of beautiful scenery and interesting places 
in the neighborhood of Manchester. Some of these pictures are in oil colors, 
ome are water color of drawings, etchings, engravings, photographs. * * * 
“There is a collection of pictures of common wild and garden flowers; one of 
ictures of common wild birds; one of pictures of other animals; one of pictures 
f well-known places in different parts of the world; one of beautiful landscapes; 
me of seascapes; one of war scenes; one of religious subjects; one of portraits; 
me of copies of works by Turner, chiefly illustrating English scenery. In some 
f these groups of pictures, representations of the same subject by different kinds 
f art—etchings, engravings, water-color drawings—are placed side by side, in 
rder to facilitate careful comparison of the effects obtained by different processes. 
‘‘Many of the pictures—the plates of the Liber Studiorum and those of the Har- 
bours of England, for instance—have full descriptions and criticisms hung by 
hem. Each of the other pictures has, or will have, a label containing a short 
xplanation of the subject and a statement as to whether it is an engraving or 
tching, or whatever it may be. One set of pictures illustrates the development 
f architecture and sculpture; one that of Ita’ian painting. In casesthere are sets 
f the tools, etc., used in the various art-reproducing processes, plates etched and 
repared for etching, engraved plates with impressions from the plates, wood 
locks for wood engraving, the stones used for lithography, the blocks used for 
olor printing, and a brief explanation of each of the processes. Short lectures on 
he processes and on many other subjects will be given. A band of explainers is 
eing formed. There are also cases of examples of well-shaped, pleasantly colored 
ottery and glass, metal work, and textile fabrics, many of them of the commonest 
 
-P-A-G-E-416
  1374 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
kinds, fitted for common use. There is, too, a model small house, fitted up with 
the well-shaped, well-made things by Mr. W. Morris and Mr. W. A. S. Benson, 
and there aresome casts of Greek sculpture, shown to adv: antage by haying richly 
colored stuffs hung behind and on each side of them. * * * 
“It is intended that each of the collections lent to schools shall eventually con- 
tain a few examples of beautiful textile fabrics, beautiful common pottery and 
glass, and casts from sculpture, but at present they consist of pictures only. We 
lend pictures of beautiful scenery and interesting buildings near Manchester— 
these pictures are chiefly photographs—chromolithographs and engravings of 
other beautiful landscapes and sea scenes, pictures of scenes in the Holy Land and 
Egypt, of historical scenes, of beautiful wild and garden flowers, of trees, of com- 
mon birds and butterflies, of fairy tales—good examples, in short, of almost every 
kind of picture. Many of the pictures are—all are to be—provided with labels to 
tell what the subject is and of what process the picture is a product; if it ischeap, 
what its price is and that of its frame. The labels also make as many references 
as possible to the Art Museum, to books, to our local botanical gardens, and other 
pleasant places open to work people. Thus one of the labels to a picture of a 
swallow gives a little information about the habits of the bird; another tells that 
the picture is a lithograph, colored by hand, that an explanation of lithography 
and the things used in it can be seen in the Art Museum; that pleasant informa- 
tion about and good pictures of birds are found in White's Selborne, a copy of 
which can be bought for sixpence, and in John’s English Birds in their Haunts, 
which costs 6s. 83d. The label toa frame containing pictures of garden flowers 
tells that the pictures are chromolithographs, speaks of the imperfections of this 
_ process of representation, and recommends that the pictures be compared with 
water-color drawings of the same flowers in the Art Museum. It tells also that 
some of the flowers will grow in houses in Manchester, and that they are to be 
seen in the botanical gardens and in some of the public parks, The label to a set 
of photographs of Greek sculpture tells that casts of the sculpture are in the Art 
Museum and praises their beauty. * * * 
“After what I have already said, I hardly need add that we do not expect that 
pictures of beautiful places and things can at first have much meaning for those 
children who know nothing, or almost nothing, about the things represented. 
The child for whom real buttercups and daisies, the flight of swallows, and the song 
of larks have no happy associations, who has never felt gladness in fields or on 
hills, will see very little in pictures of flowers and birds, fields and hills. But still 
pictures of these things will be of great value even for such children. Some nat- 
ural beauty is within reach of almost every child; most children have some of it 
sometimes before their eyes. Ignorance of it is so common, partly because their 
eyes have not gained from heart and mind the power to see these things, partly 
because ‘what the eye never sees the heart never longs for,’ and opportunities of 
seeing natural beauty at a little distance from home, and of bringing it into homes, 
are not used or sought for. 
“The words now so often quoted, which Mr. Browning puts into the mouth of 
Fra Lippo Lippi, are, I believe, perfectly true: 
“We're made so that we love 
First when we see them painted, things we have passed 
Perhaps a hundred times, nor cared to see; 
And so they are better, painted—better to us, 
Which is the same thing. Art was given for that— 
God uses us to help each other so, 
Lending our minds out.’ 
“Tf a child is led in school, as he easily may be by a few words spoken by his 
teacher, to notice the form and color of a flower in a picture, or the forms and 
colors in a picture of landscape, and to find a little pleasantness in them, he will

   be suré to notice with pleasure the next flower or place of the kind he meets With, 
and pleasure in the thing will make him care more for the picture, and will give 
meaning to the name when he next reads it in a book, and thus will begin for him 
that interaction of art, literature, and nature, to which each of the three owes 
most of its power to give us ennobling pleasure. * * * 
“I must say a few words respecting the success which has already been obtained 
by the use of pictures in schools. We have as yet lent pictures only to twenty 
schools, and the Art Museum has only been open a few weeks. We have not, 
therefore, had time to ascertain if a considerable number of children will be led 
iby our school pictures to study the collection in the museum. But we know that 
lin other ways the pictures lent have been very useful. I will give some evidence, 
which has come to me without my seeking it. Mr. Godolphin Rooper, Her Maj- 
lesty’s inspector of schools at Bradford, visited on a Saturday some of the schools 
in Manchester to which we have lent pictures. He told me that he found some 
children playing in the street near one of the schools and talked to them about 
the pictures. They told him that they liked having them and that some of the 
children brought their dinners to school in order to seethem. I asked a boy who, 
la few weeks ago, was sent to guide me from one board school to another if he and 
his schoolfellows liked our pictures. He said, ‘Some of us come half an hour 
learlier to see them, especially when there are any fresh ones,’ Mr. Mellor, the 
aster of the Manchester Free Elementary School, told me that our pictures not 
lonly brighten the schoolrooms and make them pleasanter for teachers and chil-| 
dren, but also enable him to give the children, ina way which is pleasant for both 
sides, clear ideas about many things—ideas which, thus given, he says, are never 
‘orgotten. He pointed to one chromolithograph which has taught many children 
she meaning of ‘ plain’ and of ‘river’ and ‘group,’ and to another which has given 
lear ideas of ‘a glade’ ‘ tree trunks,’ ‘foliage,’ etc. * * * 
“‘T can not use here the arguments which seem to me to prove that public gar- 
ens and art galleries ought to be open on Sundays, but at least I must say thatit 
is of such immense importance that children shall gain familiarity with beautiful 
hings, and that parents and children of the working classes in towns shall be 
nabled to have pleasures in common, that, if gardens and art galleries are not to 
opened on Sundays, we ought to lose no time in transferring their contents to 
hose places which are open on Sundays—to Sunday schools, churches, and 
chapels.” = 
WoRrK OF THE BROOKLYN INSTITUTE. 
In the spring of 1896 the section on art education of the Brooklyn Institute of 
rts and Sciences inaugurated an exhibition of ‘“‘ works of art suitable for the 
decoration of schoolrooms,” which was held at 174 Montague street, Brooklyn, 
arch 21 to April 4, 1896. A catalogue of the exhibition has been published, and 
is preliminary to a report on the subject to be made later by the institute. The 
atalogue contains 412 entries, including photographic reproductions, engravings, 
tchings, original drawings, statuary, and pottery suitable for schoolroom dec- 
ration. Prices attached range from 25 cents to $70. In his introduction to the 
atalogue Prof. Walter S. Goodnough, chairman of the section on art education, 
ays: 
“The purpose of this exhibition is to bring to the attention of educational 
uthorities and the public of this city and vicinity a most important educational 
ovement, destined to have great influence. It originated in England in 1883, 
under the leadership of John Ruskin, and extending to this country, has been taken 
(p enthusiastically in many cities. A fuller report of this movement will be made

in print later, by the section on art education of the Brooklyn Institute. This 
exhibition is intended to be suggestive, not complete or exhaustive, of works of 
art suitable for public schoolrooms of all grades. 
“Tn other cities public funds have not been drawn upon, except to the extent of 
providing picture moldings and suitable colored walls, ceilings, and woodwork. 
Works of art have been loaned or presented to the schools by alumni associations, 
graduating classes, friends, or patrons; also by civic or educational societies, art 
clubs or associations, and other organizations interested in the social progress and 
well-being of the city through the proper education of its future citizens. 
‘In Boston the Public School Art League, with the consent and cooperation of 
the board of education, decorated several schools. In Philadelphia the Civic Club 
purchased works of art for and decorated a school selected by the board of education, 
“In Chicago, St. Louis, Cambridge, Salem, Brookline, New Haven, and numer- 
ous other places much has been done. Itis hoped that public-spirited citizens and 
organizations will aid and support this movement in Brooklyn. 
“The day is not far distant when all bare, white walls in the schoolroom will 
be replaced by pleasing tints and works of art. Originals or acceptable reproduc- 
tions will hang upon the walls or find place in cabinets or cases provided for this 
purpose. 
“A recent writer asks, ‘How shall our life, public and private, be raised to a 
higher plane? What better means can be used to inspire patriotism and chasten 
private life than the influence of those arts which embody the ideal? Where can 
this influence be exerted so well as in the public school? In youth the mind is| 
most open to the nobler influences; impressions then formed are most lasting.’ 
‘Surround young people during school hours with pictures and statuary, set off| 
by tinted walls and decorated ceilings, and the silent beauty irradiating therefrom) 
will quicken and purify the taste without encroaching upon school time.’ ‘Art in 
daily contact with life is a silent but all-powerful and ever-constant and undying 
influence in the shaping and molding of character, It will do more for refining, 
elevating, broadening, and even tempering of character than all other forces com‘ 
bined, except religion, and when art and religion have both been true, the one has 
helped the other. Without true art no nation has been, can be, or will be great, 
and as the twig is more easily bent than the trunk, the process will best begin with 
the young.’ 
«¢*« The public school is the place to which we should turn chief attention in our| 
effort to promote a more beautiful public life in America. The schoolhouse and 
grounds should be beautiful, and the child should be surrounded by beauty in the 
schoolroom from first to last.’ 
“Art education is a primary part of true industrial and of spiritual education. 
Every school should teach the pupils, and through them the people, that everything, 
that man uses of wood or metal or stone, of wool or silk, printed, woven, or wrought, 
should be beautiful; and it should provide means for the development and exercise} 
of the creative faculty with which all are endowed, and which brings man into his 
highest estate. ‘If we can once give beauty its rights in the schools, we shall have 
done the greatest thing which we can do toward securing for our people a more 
beautiful public life.’ 
«««The good, the true, the beautiful,’ were words the Greeks loved to use. As 
we open our eyes to see the beauty of God's earth, and sea, and sky, so let us be} 
content only when we see beauty, too, in all the works of our hands—in the home, 
the school, the shop, the street. 
“The school wall should speak of the ideal to the eyes of the child. The draw- 
ing, engraving, etching, photograph, photogravure, the cast, the product of th 
potter’s skill, and of the art worker in stained glass and in metal, will play a larger] 
part in elementary education in the public school of the future.

“Asa means of making more real the great events and facts of history, litera- 
ture, science, and art, as well as for the purpose of bringing greater culture, 
refinement, and more civilizing influences into the schoolroom, of cultivating an 
appreciation and love of the beautiful, and of educating the zsthetic and emotional 
nature of the child, good art works have an untold value. Weendeavor toacquaint 
the pupil with the great masters and masterpieces in history and literature. Should 
we not do the same in art, when photographs and other reproductions can be had 
at so small a cost? Should we not bring beautiful form and color into the school- 
room, when good art in the form of pottery is so plentiful and inexpensive? 
“The section on art education will receive contributions of funds or art works 
for this purpose, and will endeavor to carry out the desires of donors. Works in 
this exhibition, with some exceptions, may be bought and presented to any par- 
ticular school, or be placed in the hands of the section on art education, to be 
placed in some school, either as a loan ora gift. Receipts from the sale of the cata- 
logues will be used to purchase works from this exhibition, to place in Brooklyn 
public schools.

Enduring stays to us; 
The bust outlasts the throne, 
The coin, Tiberius.” 
INTERIOR DECORATION OF SCHOOLHOUSES.! 
In the autumn of 1896 Mr. Walter Gilman Page, artist and member of the Bos- 
ton school committee, published a little pamphlet on the Interior Decoration of 
Schoolhouses. It contains lists of photographs and casts suitable for decoration, 
and is intended ‘‘ to answer the questions: What is best for schoolroom decoration? 
Where can photographs and casts be obtained? What are the sizes and what are 
the prices?” 
Mr. Page says, in part: 
I think it is pretty generally conceded that to decorate a schoolroom is a good 
thing to do. Ishall consider it unnecessary to enlarge upon this point, though 
the names of those who have advocated the plan would include those best known 
in the artistic and educational worlds, and facts adduced from what has already 
been accomplished would give interesting information to those who need encour- 
agement in their attitude toward this question. I would rather turn your atten- 
tion to a few practical points, based upon actual work in the schools of Boston. 
The very first item for consideration is the tinting of the walls. It is only very 
recently that schoolroom walls have been anything but the bare white plaster, so 
far as Boston is concerned, and this condition prevails in other cities and towns 
at present; but Boston has happily outgrown this period, and now all class rooms 
are tinted some sort of color, but usually far from the right one. 
My experience has directed me, first, to select colors which will not absorb the 
light, and to lay them on the wall so as to give a flat and dead surface, that there 
may be no reflection; next, to select colors which are harmonious and artistic in 
effect; and lastly, to select colors which are soothing, not irritating, to the optic 
nerve. 
Upon this latter item a celebrated specialist has given me his professional opin- 
ion, and as I have followed his ideas so far as his point of view is concerned, it 
would be well for me to quote the following from his report: 
«The walls of all schoolrooms should have some color, for I have often seen 
children immediately and permanently recover from a persistent recurring dis- 
eased condition of the eyes when removed from a schoolroom with white walls, 
and sent elsewhere to school, or kept at home, where the walls are tinted. The

1378 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
principal color of the walls should be of an even toue, so that the amount of light 
reflected will be the same from all parts of the surface, as waving or clouded effects 
are very trying to sensitive eyes. Any color may be placed in its proper position 
with regards to its safety for schoolroom walls by remembering the general rule 
with regard to the sensitiveness of the eye to the colors of the spectrum, which 
is, that the nearer the color is to the red end of the spectrum, the more irritating 
it is to the eyes; and the nearer the color is to the blue end of the spectrum, the 
easier it is to the eyes, with the single exception that the extreme violet rays are 
also irritating. 
“From this it will be seen that red and all its derivatives should be rigidly 
excluded, and orange also is nearly as bad, while yellow should never be taken by 
preference, but may be justifiable in an otherwise dark and badly lighted room. 
Greens and blues are absolutely safe colors, and it is not at all necessary that the 
colors should be pronounced. The depth of color should be made dependent upon 
the amount of light coming into the windows and upon its quality, as, for instance, 
whether the windows have a northern or southern exposure, whether the sun’s 
direct rays can come directly into the room when the sun sinks low in the heavens 
in the middle of a winter afternoon, and other surrounding circumstances of each 
individual room. : 
“The color of the ceiling of a schoolroom is fully as important as the color of 
the walls, particularly when there is any amount of reflected light. 
“All I have said with regard to the color on the walls is doubly true when 
applied to the color of the window shades, and this fact should always be taken 
into consideration in furnishing and decorating a schoolroom.”! 
In November, 1894, under the auspices of the Public School Art League, the 
New England Conference of Educational Workers, and the Boston Art Students’ 
Association, there was held in Boston an exhibition of photographs, reproductions 
of standard works of art suitable for schoolroom decoration. Also in Brooklyn, 
during the months of March and April of the present year, there was held a simi- 
lar exhibition, under the direction of the section on art education of the Brooklyn 
Institute of Arts and Sciences. 
These two events are the most important connected with the subject of school- 
house decoration since the movement first began in this country, but there is yet 
to be held an exhibition which shall give a clear idea of the proper order and 
grade of pictures perfectly suited to the age and understanding of the child from 
the kindergarten through the high school. 
In these two exhibitions I refer to, nearly if not quite all the photographs 
belonged to the highest grades of the grammar schools, and more particularly to 
the high schools. While, on general principles, association with works of the 
highest order can not-begin too soon, yet we want more than association, or mere 
contact and environment; we want interest, and, in consequence, understanding. 
To explain myself something more in detail, I will give a rough outline, merely 
suggestive of how I would distribute works of art through the different grades. 
For kindergarten and primary grades I would suggest pictures of the simplest 
natural objects, such as birds, their nests and eggs, wild flowers, trees, and scenes 
of rural life, such as town children seldom see and country children often fail to 
enjoy; pictures of animals in friendly relation with human beings, especially 
with children; landscapes and marine views; some of these various subjects to be 
illustrated in color, proper attention being paid to artistic merit. 
For grammar grades I would use historical portraits and scenes from history, 
with particular and special reference to the men and events connected with the 
life of our own country; pictures of architectural works of historic or artistic 
interest; such reproductions as are available from the numerous works of the old 
1 Report written by Dr. Myles Standish, Boston.

       d modern schools of painting, and,as many of our boys and girls do not go 
yond the grammar school, a judicious selection of casts from the antique should 
included. 
For the high schools you have simply to choose from the best, the product of 
1 the ages, the art of Greece and Rome, the Renaissance, down to the present 
y. The field is broad and the task the easier. 
All these subjects I have so briefly outlined have their practical uses in the 
hoolroom, in correlation with drawing, history, geography, and natural history. 
rtainly the zxsthetic sense is pleased and the daily routine made pleasanter 
id such surroundings, for nothing, to my mind, is more depressing than bare 
alls. 
The present generation can not do better than to inform itself somewhat as to 
that constitutes American art, and particularly that portion which belongs to 
e periéd of the war of the Revolution, illustrated through the masterly portraits 
that prince of portrait painters, Gilbert Stuart, and the historical pictures by 
hn Trumbull. I trust the day is not far distant when their names and their 
orks will be known to all the children of the land. 
In addition to selecting photographs and casts with reference to their character 
d suitability to age and comprehension, I would advise that they bear a relation 
one another. In order to accomplish this it will be necessary to fix upon what 
is desired to illustrate upon the walls of some particular schoolroom, 
Let it bea Greek room, Roman room, Egyptian room, or let it illustrate Eng- 
h literature or French history; different sections of the country through photo- 
raphs representative of characteristic features, birds, and animals, etc.; but let 
1 these different subjects be placed by themselves. To mix them up in one 
om, no matter how good in itself each particular object may be, will make the 
sult discordant, though there may exist certain conditions which might render 
necessary to include a variety of objects in one room. 
It is always best to give a good frame to every photograph, and it is always 
sirable to frame under glass. It is not usual or customary for us to, use cheap 
james and no glass in our homes. Why shou!d we do less for the schoolroom? 
The very best form of reproduction is none too good. To be sure, it is the most 
pensive, and financial conditions are not always such that it is feasible to carry 
t the plan of obtaining the best. Nevertheless, the best is the thing to aim at, 
d attain if possible, for inno country to-day does there exist so broad a field 
ir good as the opportunity of bringing the best art has to offer into our school- 
oms. 
In the Old World the wsthetic sense is constantly stimulated by what is offered 
every side, while in our own land, where art is to have her future throne, at 
esent we have barely made a beginning. 
The next generation is to witness an immense advance in all that relates to the 
e arts. Therefore it is important that we prepare the way. ‘Though the 
ount of time given to zsthetic subjects in the public schools is small, and to 
crease it is entirely out of the question, yet all the more for this reason does the 
an of decorating schoolrooms deserve, as it is now receiving, favorable consid- 
ation. Surround young people during school hours with pictures and statuary, 
it off by tinted walls, and the silent beauty irradiating therefrom will quicken 
d purify the taste without encroaching upon school time or interfering with 
thool work.” But while we agree to this, and while we welcome all that can be 
complished in this direction, let it be remembered by those who can aid tho 
lost in this work of interior decoration of schoolhouses that primarily school- 
uses arefor practical ends, toward whose fulfillment the introduction of objects 
art must serve as a valuable aid, and not as an impediment. In fact, I sin- 
rely trust that the school committee of the future will consider the furnishing '

of.the walls of a schoolroom as much a part of its duty as furnishing desks and 
books; for as Americans we have developed too much on one side, considering 
nothing but that which appeals to us as practical and ignoring that through 
which the glory of the past has been handed down to us. 
ART FOR THE SCHOOLROOM. * 
By Bark FERREs, in Education. 
There are few healthier indications of a genuine interest in art or a better indi 
cation of its value in general education than the movement which has for its objec 
the providing of artistic decorations for schoolrooms. A good deal has been don 
in this direction in England, and in America interest in it has found fruit in ai 
least three general exhibitions in Boston, Philadelphia, and Brooklyn. In several 
other cities and some of the lesser towns considerable progress has been made, an 
individual schools in various parts of the country possess veritable miniature art 
galleries, sonumerous are their photographic treasures. No more important work 
in introducing art into the general life of Americans has been undertaken, for 7 
means bringing it directly before children, many of whom are without artisti: 
home influence, who do not know the value of a picture even as a decoration, or 
only in a limited way, certainly not in an artistic sense. It is too much to suppos 
that every child will be interested, that the life of every pupil will be beeen 
in this way, but it would be equally foolish to set a limit upon the good that ma: 
be accomplished by it. The good that can be done, however, must not blind us to 
the fact that it must be done with the most elementary materials. * * * 
In attempting to answer the question, In what shall the artistic decoration of 
the schoolroom consist? we must keep in mind the elementary conditions at the 
outset. The object of the decorations is to create an interest in art and an appre; 
ciation of it; and the people it is proposed to benefit are, in large part, quite 
devoid of any artistic knowledge. ‘The less tax put upon the brains of the chil- 
dren the more satisfactory will be the result. A concrete idea is more easily 
grasped than an abstract one; familiar objects are comprehended quicker than 
strange ones; the lesser is mastered before the greater. In other words, we ks 
not have ‘“‘high art,” we can not concern ourselves with ‘‘ schools” and ‘“ values” 
and ‘‘tones” and all the literary and artistic paraphernalia of the modern painter. 
Weare trying to instill some knowledge of art into the minds of the multitude, 
and we must get down to the level of the multitude ourselves before we can lift 
it up. We can not clean out the gutter by sweeping cobwebs from the roof 
eornicess: #0 * 
The eee care is required in the selection of subjects; we must not shoo’ 
above the comprehension of the children; we must not set a standard so high that 
only a few can come up to it. We must,in a measure, be commonplace, an 
trust to time for greater work and more enduring results. In a sense, all sorts o 
subjects are suitable for schoolroom decoration, but experience will show that 
only a limited range of topics is available. Taking the whole field of possible 
subjects, I would arrange them in the following order of availability: (1) Patri, 
otic, (2) historical, (3) pictures of places, (4) photographs of famous people, (5)} 
architecture, (6) paintings, (7) sculpture. To these may be added plaster cas’ 
under the last head, pieces of pottery, and other inexpensive forms of roo: 
decorations * * * 
We have to deal with American children and to interest them in a form of 
decoration for the walls of which they know almost nothing. The simplest rang 
of subjects therefore would appear to be those of a patriotic nature. All ey 
have some sort of a notion of the history of their own country, even before the: 
begin its serious study. The great-names in American history are familiar to all] 
while Christopher Columbus is as familiar as the name of the parent of each child. 
 
-P-A-G-E-423
  ART DECORATIONS IN SCHOOLROOMS. ~ 1381 
Scenes in the lives of American worthies may not in themselves be familiar to the 
children, nor may their bearing on American history be understood, but any pic- 
ture which embraces, for the sake of illustration, the figure of George Washington 
is something all can understand, or about which information can usually be had 
for theasking. It is the same with Lincoln, or with any of the great names that 
adorn the pages of American history. * * * 
Next in elementary value to patriotic illustrations are pictures of historic 
events. The two subjects are, in fact, so closely related that little difference can 
be distinguished between them. Here also are subjects easily understood and~ 
naturally included within the scope of the common-school curriculum and having, 
therefore, a positive value that more artistic pictures can not have. It must be 
remembered that the children must not only see the pictures but be interested in 
them. Questions will be asked and explanations demanded that the teacher, in 
the most unexpected moments, will be called upon toreply to. Corps of lecturers 
can not be supplied to make our illustrations useful, and the movement must be 
carried out on such lines as will be productive of the best results. The teacher 
must know the pictures on his walls and understand their significance, and patri- 
otic and historical subjects have a utility from this point of view that no other 
group possesses. * * * 
Pictures illustrative of great events in the history of the world may be placed 
after those touching on American topics. Here the field is almost inexhaustible, yet 
the utmost care must always be taken to choose only subjects of general interest 
and great familiarity. The Conversion of Clovis is an event which has frequently 
been illustrated in French art, and in not a few notable pictures; yet while it was 
an event of the first importance, it does not begin to have the practical availability 
that characterizes any event in the life of Napoleon. A series of pictures illustra- 
tive of the world’s history could be made of the utmost value educationally; yet 
for its use in American schools it would probably be found that many notable 
events would have to be omitted. Availability is of more value than complete- 
ness. Portraits form another important class. Portraits of eminent Americans 
must be considered before the portraits of eminent foreigners, living or dead. 
Here, again, are subjects more or less familiar. * * * Familiar subjects have 
many advantages over unfamiliar ones, be their relative artistic merits what they 
may. A child will take a greater interest in a picture that represents something 
he himself knows of or has heard about than one utterly strange. Views of one’s 
own town, or of notable streets, places, or buildings within it, have, therefore, a 
utility of a very high order. From such pictures children will learn something of 
the value of a photograph; they will discuss its resemblance to the actual object 
and learn to understand that a picture has a real value apart from being some- 
thing to hang on the wall. From photographs of familiar places it is not more 
than a step to photographs of notable places the world over, of pictures of fine bits 
of scenery or of famous towns. * * * Pictures of places open up a field of 
great extent in schoolroom decoration. It is a general subject that, in many 
different ways and on many different points, touches directly upon the course of 
study. Geography and history can be made of living interest with the aid of 
pictures in the hands of an interested teacher. In geography alone the help would 
be enormous. Even the best of illustrated geographies fail in giving adequate 
illustration of foreign lands, of climates different from our own, of people of 
other nationalities. Place a series of carefully selected photographs illustrating 
such topics in the hands of a competent teacher and it would be easy to forecast 
the good that might be done with them. The general topic is so broad and its 
applicability so varied that it may not be necessary to limit it; yet it may not be 
unimportant to point out its value in American subjects for patriotic purposes. 
In no other, way can a clearer impression be made of the vast resources of our
-P-A-G-E-424
1382 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96, 
country and its extent than through a series of photographs of its riches in natural 
scenery, -* * 
After architecture come paintings; and if we judge from the exhibitions of 
suggested decorations, this is the form of art it is most desired to introduce into 
the schools. Here, at last, we have the form of art through which it is hoped to 
quicken the imagination and broaden the intellect, to throw open to the child a 
new field of thought and to lay the foundation of a lifelong appreciation of the 
beautiful and the artistic. Yet we must not let our theories carry us too far over 
the heads of those we are seeking to benefit; the grandest painting may be too 
great for any appreciable quantity of good to be derived from it. Once more we 
must be careful in our selections; whatever pictures are used must be compre- 
hensible. * * * With sculpture, which I would place last in order of availa- 
bility, we have a subject that can be illustrated both in photographs and in actual 
form by casts. Casts are less open to criticism than photographs, for the cheaper 
sorts, which are the most likely to be used, are of comparatively ordinary types 
that require no guide books to their meaning, With photographs we would be 
apt to use idealistic types and abstract conceptions quite beyond the range of 
children’s minds. <A cast of one of Barye’s animals, for example, is cheap and 
good. The children may not understand the perfection of its art, but they will see 
it as an animal and many of them can appreciate its naturalness. The fact that 
casts are much less familiar as objects of decoration than photographs or prints 
gives them a special interest apart from their artistic qualities. There are other 
phases of artistic decoration fully as available for schooiroom decoration as those 
already noted and possibly more intelligible. Cheap bits of pottery, especially of 
Japanese manufacture, are of the greatest value and give an unusual and much- 
needed note of color as well as of decoration. It is as important to teach the 
artistic effect of well-harmonized colors as the grouping and arrangement on the 
flat which we have in photographs. Japanese ware, even of the commonest sorts, 
will be found eminently suitable for this purpose, and the low price at which really 
excellent pieces can be had render it especially desirable. * * * 
All things considered, cheap decorations are preferable to costly ones. Thirty 
photographs at 50 cents each, supposing a suitable artistic standard were main- 
tained throughout the series, are surely more desirable than one costing $15. In 
the latter instance we have only one object that can be placed in but one room; in 
the former we have a series that may be distributed among several rooms and 
perhaps among several schools. The work to be done now is educational ina 
double sense, since it not only introduces a new element into school life, but it 
must interest people in this work, It would be a grand good thing if all our 
schoolrooms could have two or three photographs, each costing $15 or more, upon 
their walls, but there is much missionary work to be done before that happy time 
can arrive. And meanwhile we must do the best we can with the many inexpen- 
sive forms of art reproductions. Onder the direction of the French Government, 
for example, many thousands of photographs of buildings in France have been 
made that cost in this country about 50 cents each. Italian photographs are like- 
wise astonishingly cheap, and if not to be had in the shops can be imported through 
the mails at small expense. Illustrated books can be taken apart and the plates 
framed, furnishing the best of decorations at relatively small cost per plate. This 
is especially true of many continental art publications, of which, unfortunately, we 
see too little in this country. Then there are the plates published in the artistic 
and architectural journals. Not all of these are available for this work, but 
much useful material may be obtained from them at very small cost. Finally, not 
to extend the list too far, there are the colored supplements printed by the art 
papers published in the interests of amateurs, many of which are admirably repro- 
duced and entirely suitable, framed or unframed, for schoolroom decoration.

ART DECORATIONS IN SCHOOLROOMS. 1383 
+ * # T have not touched upon the question of grading the schoolroom decora- 
ion to the instruction, though for any sort of decoration to be successful it is 
mperative that this be carefully heeded. * * * 
For the upper schools the question is much less difficult than for the lower. 
Che older the pupils, the more advanced their studies, the better able will they be 
(0 appreciate such artistic adornments as may be provided-for them. If the grad- 
1ating classes of our grammar and high schools were to adopt the custom of pre- 
senting something to their school on leaving it, really valuable collections might 
9 formed in such institutions within a very short time. Once started, such a 
sustom would doubtless be gladly carried out by each succeeding class, but it- 
ight bea matter of some difficulty to inaugurate it among children to whom it 
would be new and whose parents might look upon it as a tax upon them by the 
eachers, * * * 
If the pictures are the actual property of the schools, they are likely to remain 
ermanently on the same walls. Better results may be obtained from movable 
ollections which, after being shown in one school, are removed to make room for 
mother collection, and so on, until an extended rotation may bring the first series 
ack again. If the material is ample, this may not occur until the children have 
ither changed or have thoroughly forgotten the earlier series. With such a 
leries of collections, a very large number of subjects may be brought before the 
hildren, stimulating their interest and quickening their power of comparison, 
nd certainly creating an increased appreciation of art. That, indeed, is the object 
ose who have interested themselves in this matter have most at heart. Yet it 
thould not be forgotten that very many schoolroom decorations can have an edu- 
ational value and can be usefully employed in actual study. Their utility should 
ot be forgotten in their beauty.    
       
       
             
   
     
         
    
    
    
   
   
    
       
         ART.IN THE SCHOOLROOM THROUGH DECORATION AND WoRKS OF ART. 
Miss Stella Skinner and Miss M. Rachel Webster, of New Haven, Conn., have 
ublished ‘A list of casts and pictures suggested for the first eight years of school, 
ith special reference to the general course of study in these grades.” The list 
as prepared with special reference to the schools of New Haven, and contains 
sts of casts and pictures classified by years and under the headings of general 
+ culture, literature, history, language, geography, and historic art. The names 
£ painters are added in most cases. 
Miss Skinner delivered a paper before the Buffalo meeting of the National Edu- 
ational Association on this subject, which may be considered an illumination of 
er list. It is here reproduced from Art Education, October-November, 1896: 
“Many of our primary teachers responded to a suggestion, made several years 
go, that a picture of the Madonna be hung in the schoolroom in connection with 
e Christmas idea. This gave rise toa discussion in a subsequent teachers’ meet- 
ig as to how the picture should be interpreted to the children. Some felt that its 
eligious significance should be given, but the consensus of opinion was that it 
ould stand asthe type of motherhood and the love which surrounds all children. 
«We were much interested to learn what madonnas appealed most to the chil- 
en, and found that their choice centered upon three: Raphael's ‘Madonna of the 
air’ and ‘Sistine Madonna,’ and the Bodenhausen ‘Madonna.’ Even the little 
lhildren are impressed with the majesty of the Sistine; but I think they love most 
e ‘Madonna of the Chair,’ in which brother love is added to parental. 
‘*Many touching incidents are recalled connected with the pictures. The chil- 
ren were eager to tell of home babies; that was the way their mother loved their 
aby; and we came to realize that some of the poorest homes were rich in affec- 
on. The primary children of one of our Sunday schools commemorated the

Christmas season by giving a Bodenhausen Madonna to one of the mission kinder. 
gartens. The picture was placed against the wall, while the teacher told the 
Christmas story to the children clustered about it. As they turned to go to their 
tables, one little waif asked if he might ‘kiss the baby,’ and straightway every 
little urchin in turn bent over and reverently kissed the Christ-child as he turne 
to goto his work, * * * 
“A few weeks ago I asked a thoughtful primary teacher, who is in close sym 
pathy with the best kindergarten ideas, for her experience in interpreting th 
madonna idea to her children. After relating the various plans she had tried, sh 
gave as the result of her experience the opinion that the most satisfactory way 
was to let the picture greet the children when they first entered school in Septem) 
ber and become familiar to them, but to defer its interpretation until the Christ] 
mas season. One little fellow confided to her that the picture ‘made him think of 
his mother; she was awful nice.’ 
“With the madonnas was told something of the life of Raphael, his unselfish 
character, his eagerness to learn, and his being a countryman of Columbus, living 
in sunny Italy at about the same time. In many instances the beautiful boyish 
portrait of Raphael was shown. * * * 
“We were agreed at the outset that pictures in a schoolroom should serve tw: 
purposes—primarily, that of general art culture or spiritual uplifting, and second, 
arily, the strengthening of other school subjects. While a picture might serv 
both purposes, it need not necessarily doso. * * * 
“Aside from pictures expressing a religious idea, other illustrations: of child 
hood are needed, and of animal and plant life, such as ‘ Feeding the Chickens,’ by 
Jacques, and Lambert’s ‘Family of Cats.’ 
“Van Dyck’s ‘Children of Charles I’ is always a favorite; the pupils note th 
family resemblance in the children; they think they must have a kind mother 
because they look so happy and neatly dressed. They decide that the childrer 
have their ‘Sunday clothes’ on because they are having their picture taken; and 
they enjoy the little spaniel at the brother’s feet. Other artists suggested fo1 
study in the primary grades are Michael Angelo, Murillo, Dupré, and Millet. 
While the work of Michael Angelo, the man, requires maturity of thought fo1 
comprehension, the boy Michael carving the faun’s head out of a piece of marbl 
interests children very much, and the story connected with it delights them. 
Even tiny children speak of the laughing expression on the faun’s face. Michael 
Angelo, the stern, serious, lonely man, has little attraction for children, but they 
can be told of his devotion to his work, how he ‘ wrought with a sad sincerity’ t 
express the great thoughts which came to him, and how his life was gladdenec 
by having the sunny-natured Raphael for a friend. 
“Cattle and sheep being subjects for special study in language and science ix 
the second and third years, Dupré and Millet were chosen as representative 
artists. The children enjoy Dupré's cheerful episodes of farm life. His ‘Escape 
Cow,’ and the frantic efforts of the farm boy to catch her, delight them; while 
‘The White Cow,’ with the young girl milking, and her mother watching from 
the doorway, is a charming pastoral scene. In sheep pictures we have an embar- 
rassment of riches—Millet’s ‘Shepherdess; ‘The Sheepfold,’ by Jacques: Le Rolle’s 
‘In the Meadow,’ Monk’s ‘ Hillside,’ and many others; while ‘David the Shepherd 
Boy,’ by Elizabeth Gardner, is full of inspiration. 
“Other choice pictures for primary grades are Bouguereau’s ‘At the Fountain; 
a young girl in the dewy freshness of childhood, looking at you with wistful. 
appealing eyes, her hands clasping the handle of a quaint pitcher, or teapot as the 
children called it, until one little Italian remembered having seen similar wate: 
vessels in his native land. Also, Madam Le Brunn’s portrait of herself and 
daughter; Von Bremen’s ‘ By the Brook,’ and Reynolds’s ‘Angel Heads.’ One littl 
   
-P-A-G-E-427

girl liked the ‘Angel Heads’ because ‘if she was good she would be like them some 
day.’ Another ‘ because they were in the sky,’ and yet another because ‘it helped 
her to be good and kind.” * * * t 
“Tt has been my experience that little children manifest most interest in pictures 
containing some human element. Pictures of animals rank next, while land- 
scapes, marine views, etc., come last on the list. When this human element is 
lacking, the children’s imagination always hastens to invest the picture with some 
suggestion of life. * * * 
“In the intermediate grades, Landseer as the painter of dogs, Rosa Bonheur of 
horses, and F. 8. Church of lions, have been chosen for special study. 
‘© Also Thomas Moran, the painter of Western scenery; Jules Breton, who gives 
us such happy illustrations of out-of-door labor, and Boughton, for his artistic 
interpretation of incidents in the lives of the Pilgrims. Then, too, in these grades, 
where the children are passing from the happy unconsciousness of childhood te 
the ‘long, long thoughts of youth,’ casts and pictures of ideal grace and beauty 
have been suggested as a constant influence in shaping their ideals. Thorwald- 
sen’s seated ‘ Mercury;’ the beautiful bust of the ‘ Maiden of Lille;’ Burne-Jones’s 
‘Hope,’ and ‘Temperance;’ Max’s ‘Nydia;’ the ‘ Viking’s Daughter,’ by Church, 
and Thayer’s ‘ Brother and Sister.’ 
“Tn the grammar grades, the masters of landscape and marine are studied— 
Corot, Innes, Edward Moran, and Turner; and in addition, such pictures as ‘Queen 
Louise,’ Tadema’s ‘Reading from Homer,’ Mason’s ‘ Harvest Moon,’ and Burne- 
Jones’s ‘Golden Stair’ have been selected, the aim being to give variety both as to 
subject and cost, but to ‘hold fast to that which is good.’ 
“Tn casts we have tried to follow the same sequence of thought as in the pic- 
tures, madonnas, and cherubs, with miniature animals for language lessons in the 
primary grades. In the intermediate, choir boys, animals, and mythological sub- 
jects related to literature and examples of historic art, while in the grammar 
grades the choicest of Greek and Roman sculpture, busts of great men, and typ- 
ical examples of historic art are chosen. 
“ Realizing the great desire for color on the part of children, and the need of it 
in our schoolrooms, a diligent search has been made for suitable pictures to meet 
this want. Many flower and fruit pieces have been found, and assigned to grades 
in harmony with the plans for nature’study and drawing. Some good reproduc- 
tions of landscape and marines also, and a few historical pictures, besides dainty 
little color sketches of children, birds, and animals for primary grades. Some 
interesting suggestions of simple, conventional colored pictures of the seasons and 
of Mother Goose incidents were shown at the recent Brooklyn exhibit of works of 
art and warmly advocated by one who had given the matter careful thought, and 
i hope soon to test their value in the schoolroom. 
“Tt is not easy nor perhaps necessary to decide what pictures should be consid- 
ered under the head of art culture, and what ones classified under literature, 
‘United States history, geography, and historicart. Some minister to many needs, 
nearly all tell a story which may be utilized in language, literature, or history. 
“Those for primary grades, in which the story claims the attention, such as 
Pandora’s Box, Dupré’s Balloon, Rosenthal’s Home from a First Voyage, or Hardy’s 
Ulysses Ploughing the Seashore, would be classified as language pictures, while 
portraits of authors, with views of their homes and pictures illustrative of their 
writings, would come under literature. 
“In this connection, and also in geography and history, not only pictures to 
hang on the walls, but portfolio collections and note-book illustrations, should be 
borne in mind. ~ 
“We find that the children are very fond of the portraits of authors. I was 
surprised the other day to learn how many pupils in a first year primary room

preferred a picture of Longfellow in his Study to anything else in the room and 
greatly pleased with their explanations of the picture. In very broken English, 
for the most of the children were Russians and Italians, one boy told me the story 
of the school children presenting Longfellow with his study chair, while the others 
listened delightedly. : 
“But above everything else, the children love the portraits of our national 
heroes. Recently, in a class of children 11 and 12 years old, 24 out of 30 chose 
a portrait of Washington from the half dozen or more pictures hanging on 
the walls. All statements as to choice were made in writing, so as to have 
them unbiased. Various reasons for their preference were given—his bravery, 
honesty, and kindness to animals—but the three which predominated were that 
he was the ‘Father of his country,’ our ‘First President,’ and that ‘He never told 
alie.’ One pupil, a boy of 12, writes in answer to my inquiries: ‘I like the pic- 
ture of George Washington because he was so brave, and that he didn’t tell lies. 
If I bought a picture I would buy one of George Washington. Of all the pictures 
I ever saw, I like George Washington’s the best. I could live with it for all my 
lifetime, because I love it so well.’ Another boy of 16 years, so pitifully crippled 
that he could scarcely write, says: ‘He was the finest Christian, and we want to 
follow his example. I am trying to do it.’ 
‘History is full of incidents for illustration. Beginning with early local his- 
tory, we have a picture of the ‘ First Meeting House cf the New Haven Colony’ 
and the ‘ Charter Oak at Hartford.’ Enlarging the circle of experiences, we learn 
of the adventures of Columbus, of which there are some good illustrations in 
color, Incidents in the lives of the Pilgrims have been most delightfully pictured 
by Boughton and Bayes, as well as immortalized in verse by Longfellow. 
“TI wish, however, to enter an earnest protest against placing pictures of war and 
carnage upon schoolroom walls. If we must teach the horrors of war through 
pictures, let them be in the form of portfolio illustrations for incidental use. Let 
us teach our children that our wars have resulted from a difference in principle; 
that men have fought because true to their convictions, but that universal broth- 
erhood never dies. It has been truly said that we teach our children the England 
., of George III rather than the England of to-day, which fact is doubtless largely 
responsible for the distrust and resentment which many Americans feel toward 
their mother country. We, the victors, can afford to be generous; let us banish 
from our walls and from our memories pictures of men mad with the insanity of 
war, and put in their stead such ones as Hovenden’s ‘ In the Hands of the Enemy,’ 
where all difference of opinion is forgotten in the care of a young wounded Con- 
federate in a Union home. To live for our country, rather than to die for it, is 
the lesson for to-day. Let us teach our children that they live in a country made 
free and upon soil consecrated by the blood of patriots; that their duty is to pre- 
serve these blood-bought privileges by brave and unselfish living; that, in the 
words of Carl Schurz, ‘ To live for a good cause honestly, unselfishly, laboriously, 
is at least as noble and heroic as to die for it, and usually far more difficult.’ I 
would not be understood as decrying hero worship. Let us establish as high 
ideals as possible; but let us teach that it is as heroic to lead a campaign against 
filth, corruption, and vice in a modern city as to direct an army on the battle- 
eae 
‘‘In geography the aim has been to select typical illustrations of the various 
subjects for portfolios, and to call attention to pictures by good artists which 
might be utilized, as Turner’s ‘Approach to Venice,’ Moran’s ‘New York from the 
Bay;’ ‘On the Coast Near Scheveningen,’ by Mesday, and Schreyer’s ‘ Halt on the 
Oasis.’ Edwin D. Mead says: ‘A bright boy would without effort, and almost, by 
the by, learn ten times as much about the aspect, the industries, and resources 
of the United States if a series of great photographs, now so accessible and so 
cheap, of the White Mountains, the New England coast, the beauties of the Hud-

     ison; scenes in New York, the metropolis of the country; in Washington, its capi- 
ital; the Great Lakes, the Mississippi, the prairies, the Rocky Mountains, the Penn- 
isylvania coal mine, the Southern cotton field, and the cornfields of Dakota were 
ion the walls of the school or in portfolios as he could learn by weeks of study in 
the books.’ 
“In historic art illustrations the way is comparatively clear. Having a well- 
defined course of study in art education, such examples of architecture, sculpture, 
nd ornament as best illustrate this course should be assigned to each grade, cor- 
elating geography and, later, general history with it as closely as possible. 
**Modern and local examples of the different styles should be studied and com- 
ared with the originals. For instance, with Egyptian art we show the gateway 
0 Grove Street Cemetery as a beautiful example of thepylon. Our old statehouse 
nm the green, of which pictures have been preserved, is a good example of the 
reek; the ‘Scroll and Key’ Society building of the Saracenic, and Osborn Hall of 
he Romanesque. 
“Sometimes, art features being equal, there is a choice in object as to the story 
mbodied. One would, therefore, select the arch of Constantine rather than that 
f Titus, one celebrating, as it does, the victory of Christian over pagan beliefs, 
he other the downfall of Jerusalem. 
**So, too, one would choose ‘Orpheus, Eurydice, and Hermes’ in preference to 
‘Aphrodite Persuading Helen.’” 
As the teaching of art in the public school is closely related to the art decoration 
f school rooms, the following articles, by Mr. John 8. Clark, of Boston, are added: 
e first, on the “Creative power in art,” was delivered before the annual meeting 
f the Western Drawing Teachers’ Association, in Aurora, Ill., March 28, 1895. 
e second, on the “‘ Place of artin general education,” is part of a discussion at the 
enver meeting of the National Educational Association, July, 1895. 
CREATIVE POWER IN ART. 
This gathering of enthusiastic workers in the cause of art education, and these 
xhibits that line the walls, showing what a practical, helpful outcome your work 
as reached in the schools, move me involuntarily to retrospection. It is now 
‘wenty-five years since the American movement for art education began in Mas- 
achusetts, and it has been my good fortune to be identified with it almost ever 
ince its inauguration. You all know it was begun by Dr. Philbrick, then the 
uperintendent of the Boston schools and a member of the (Massachusetts) State 
oard of education; Mr. Charles C. Perkins, of the Boston school board, and Mr. 
alter Smith, the first state director of drawing for Massachusetts. I became 
dentified with the movement almost at the first, and perhaps have done nota little 
in carrying the work beyond Massachusetts. All three of the persons named have 
assed away, and to me alone of the four who took up the brunt of the work has” 
t been given to see the growth of the undertaking to its present development. 
There are among you some who can remember the early days of this great move- 
ent, and who can recall how, notwithstanding the initial work was so great an 
[vance upon previous instruction, it yet embodied only a partial understand- 
mg of what art might and should be in education, and only the most meager notion 
f its relations to the rest of the school instruction. The exhibits on the walls 
ere in this building to-day stand for the truest and most advanced progress that 
has yet been made in thiscountry; and what a contrast they present to the earlier 
ork. Massachusetts herself, the birthplace of the movement, with all her State 
lirection of the study, can not produce results as significantas these in their show- 
ng of the development of children’s observation, thought, wsthetic feeling, and 
reative power. 
     
-P-A-G-E-430
    1388 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
But great as has been the progress in the past, still greater progress lies before 
us through the larger opportunities for still more important work. We are now 
facing new demands upon art education arising from the enlarging ideals of gen- 
eral education that surpass everything in the past. Those of you who were pres- 
ent at the superintendents’ meeting in Cleveland a few weeks ago, or who have 
read the report of the committee of fifteen which was then submitted and dis- 
cussed, know that the greatest of all educational questions was there made an 
issue. The question which was discussed by Dr. Harris on the one hand and by 
the representatives of experimental psychology and Herbartian pedagogy on the 
other hand amounted really to this: Is the essential being of the child—the soul 
of the child—an inborn entity, or is it a gradual synthesis of sense activities? It 
was stoutly insisted upon by Dr. Harris that, before discussing how to correlate 
the studies in the curriculum of which we hear so much in current educational 
discussions, we must consider what the essential values are which have to be cor- 
related; that before we can intelligently discuss the question of concentration in 
the instruction, we must first determine where the true pivotal point in human 
education is upon which to concentrate. 
In this meeting to-day the subject assigned me is ‘‘ Representative drawing,” but 
instead of speaking on any detailed points of technique, which will be ably and 
sufficiently treated by others, I wish rather to remind you of some of the larger 
implications of the subject as involved in the current discussions of education as| 
a whole, and of the true relation of art education to the discussed question. 
To come directly to the point, let me ask, first, What is art? What is its signifi- 
cance in the social life of man? Briefly we may say it is the sign and product of 
the creative activity of the individual. Now, creative activity is something differ- 
ent from and more than the mere expression or reflection of sense impressions 
received from’ surrounding nature. It is different from and more than any mere 
report or repetition of what has been found in nature through the study of natural] 
science. We hear much in these days about science study and nature study. 
They are often championed as if they in themselves constituted the only true and 
sufficient education. Now, I realize their undeniable importance in education. 
I would not say a disparaging word of natural science or nature study in the 
schools. In fact, I would be glad to help enforce the thought of their importance, 
But shall we not be making a great mistake if we undertake and claim to find in 
nature all that children need? 
I have been a careful student of the works of those who are directly occupied] 
with physiological psychology, and also of the doctrines of those educators whose] 
pedagogical theories are professedly based on this laboratory psychology. I feel] 
the greatest interest in the experimental researches that are going on. It certainly] 
is of immense importance for us all to know as much as we can learn about how 
body conditions mind and soul and how sense experiences influence mental activ-| 
ities. Many of these researches into physical conditions and tendencies are full] 
of suggestiveness to both the educator and the philanthropist. But they can not] 
of themselves rightly constitute or produce any new philosophy of education,| 
They only emphasize the great need and opportunity for the practical exercise ot 
some philosophy that shall be sane and sound. The mistake made by some of th 
educators of the day in deducing theories of education from this modern labora- 
tory psychology is that they forget that such investigations have to do and ca: 
have to do with only one side of the child’s life, i. e., his sense contact with hi: 
material environment. Of course if one takes the frankly materialistic groun 
that what we call spiritual life is only a specialized form of molecular movement,| 
another link in the circle of natural forces, then it would be perfectly logical an 
consistent to make the observed effects of sense contact with the material worl 
the exclusive basis of educational theory and practice. But if we believe in th 
reality of spiritual forces and spiritual powers which are not derived from matte:
-P-A-G-E-431
ART DECORATIONS IN SCHOOLROOMS. 1389 
nor from thé forces playing through matter, then it becomes conceivable, even 
inevitable, that a good part of the child’s life should be recognized as all the time 
going on in a manner everlastingly its own manner, influenced by but not entirely 
dependent upon the sense impressions received from the outside world. 
Without attempting to argue the question in detail, the broad and beautiful 
inner life of a girl like Helen Keller, almost cut off as she is from the world of 
sense, wholly deprived of sight and of hearing, yet with a mind and soul so alive 
and so exquisitely responsive to what is best in human experience, would certainly 
seem to indicate the limited relevancy of sense susceptibility to soul activity. 
The physiological psychologists are rendering a great service in the cause of 
education through their studies into the physical conditions of mental action. 
They do not profess to measure, weigh, and tabulate the element of individuality 
or personality in the child. The educational mistakes made in the name of physio- 
logical psychology are usually made not by the laboratory students themselves, 
but by those educators who quote and use their recorded experiments as a complete 
statement of what teachers have to work with, instead of seeing that it is only a 
partial statement. 
The attack made by some of the new school of educators upon all educational 
theories as worthless is a curious inconsistency, for this attack in itself implies a 
theory that the natural instincts and tendencies of the child are invariably good, 
or at least good enough, and that the entire absence of constraint or coercion will 
secure the best general development.

It seems sometimes as if some*of the educators of the new school assume the 
child to be something like an wolian harp, whose destiny is simply to vibrate 
according to the determinable laws of acoustics in response to the impulse of moy- 
ing air. They seem to advocate that all we need to do as teachers is to study the 
composition and growth of the wood and strings in the eolian harp, study the 
laws of tension, study the atmospheric composition and meteorology, and then 
place the harp, as well made as possible, where the wind will blow over it under 
the most promising conditions, and accept with reverence whatever sounds are 
produced. They overlook the main spiritual fact of the child’s life. They forget 
that there is an invisible and unmeasurable something born in the child which 
also enters into the problem, and actually counts for more than any of these visible 
and measurable material elements in determining the nature and quality of his 
activities and the character of the product of those activities. 
Let me illustrate what I mean by a diagram which I know is familiar to many 
of you. 
You teachers know that you never really see the little child who is before you. 
You see the externals of him, you see the manifestation of his activities, but the 
real child himself you can only infer from those activities. How does the outside 
world reach the child’s inward self? Through his senses. And how does he 
manifest or express to the outside world his inward states and activities? Chiefly 
through the tongue and the hand; through what he says and does or makes. Now, 
is everything that he makes an art product? That is the question that we must
-P-A-G-E-432
1390 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
answer first of all in the face of the general problem. If acertain object in his 
environment makes an impression on him through his sense of sight and his hand 
at once registers or records that impression by drawing, is the drawing a work 
of art? Not necessarily. To a large extent that would be a purely mechanical 
process by which undulatory movements of the all-pervading ether induce mus- 
cular movements in the fingers. The child’s personality may scarcely enter it at 
all. If it does not enter into it, the product is not art. But see what else may 
take place, If the impression appeals to the child’s personality, if he thinks about 
it, absorbs it, and digests it in a spiritual sense, it becomes transformed, some- 
what as bodily food is transformed; it becomes an organic part of himself. Then, 
when his hand moyes in obedience to his will to create forth an embodiment of 
his new experience, the drawing is a great deal more than the sign of delicately 
correlated physical forces. It is the manifestation of the child's spiritual life; 
and being this, it is, in an elementary way, true art. 
This bit of practical psychology leads us to an important educational consider- 
ation. While giving due place to nature study, we need also to place great empha- 
sis upon whatever tends to develop the essentially spiritual nature of the child. 
It is true we do not know where the consciousness of the child comes from or just 
what it is. We know no more about it to-day than the Greeks did in Plato's time, reative 6 =

for all the intervening centuries of study and speculation. Here we are in the 
presence of the unknowable. But what we do know or may know is something 
abont the more effective ways of appealing to it through the intervening space 
and darkness. The gist of our whole educational discussion is here. Spiritisacted 
upon more through the contagion of what is itself spiritual than through the 
incentive of what is itself material. The true educational service rendered by the 
teaching of natural science is not the development of soul out of coordained sense 
impressions, but the nourishing of an already existing soul with sense impressions 
which shall be spiritually absorbed and assimilated so as to furnish the creative 
imagination with worthy and abundant material on which or by which to work. 
The bee, so John Burroughs tells us, does not ‘‘ gather honey all the day” ready 
made. He gathers flower nectar. Honey is the bee’s own product. It is the 
nectar plus the bee. 
Is there any question as to the comparative value of the material and spiritual 
sides of human experience and social life? Look over the multitudinous occupa- 
tions of civilized men to-day. Stand on some street corner in the busiest part of

       bermanent good in the outcome of this perpetual activity? More than nine-tenths 
bf it all goes simply to sustain and continue the mere physical existence of the 
ace. Men and women work to-day to produce food and shelter and clothing so 
hat they may be able to go to work again to-morrow and earn the means of sub- 
kisting another day so that they may go to work still another day, and so on and 
bn. Butvis this all? Does human activity move only in this circle on the physical 
blane without ever producing anything of permanent value? Let us see. What 
becomes of the grain raised by the labor of the Iowa farmer? It goes all over the 
vorld. As food it is taken up into the physical systems of all sorts and conditions 
bf men in different quarters of the globe. The larger part of it counts simply in 
strengthening other men—the carpenter, the mason, the machinist—to do other 
inds of simple prosaic work, all on the same frankly physical level as the work 
bf the farmer, and all alike productive of things consumable and perishable. But 
perhaps some portion of the farm 
product feeds the brain of a Ten- 
hyson or a Lowell, and helps make 
bossible the composing of an ‘‘In 
Memoriam” or a ‘‘Commemora- 
ion Ode;” or a Millet, and helps 
him paint ‘‘The Angelus;” or a 
Bt. Gaudens, and helps him model 
p heroic Farragut or Lincoln; or 
h Richardson, and helps him build 
b church like Trinity in Boston. 
(Then the humble material prod- 
ct has fulfilled a still higher des- 
‘iny. It has helped bring into ex- 
istence spiritual creations which 
Ho not die, but which, by spiritual 
induction and contagion, lead to 
Btill other spiritual activities in

inspiring power of any truly great

pbmples of the truth of George 
liot’s saying, ‘‘ Fruit is seed.”

And education to-day in the search for the point of concentration ought not to 
be unmindful of the lesson of history. We hear a great deal about the necessity 
pf making everything ‘‘ practical,” of giving boys and girls such training as will 
pnable them to earn a living. True they must be equipped with a knowledge of 
matter and force, and with a command of their own minds and muscles, that they 
may be helpful and so self-respectful members of society; but, more than this, 
[public education should see to it that every child, according to his ability, shall get 
some glimpse into that world of life and creative activity which exists above the

plane of mere physical existence, and whose products are the only permanently 
visible legacy which one generation leaves to the next as fruit of its own life 
experience. The child born at the close of the nineteenth century ought to come 
into a rich inheritance not only of physical luxuries and mechanical conveniences, 
but also of great thoughts and inspiring emotions. 
Art, as we find it in the world, and as we agree to treat it in education, has a 
threefold aspect, or embraces three distinct yet closely interrelated phases of cre- 
ating forth on the part of man. We have constructive art, with the shaping of 
the first rude hut and implement at one end of the scale and the building of the 
world’s great temples and cathedrals at the other end. We have representative 
art, with the rudely scratched animal outlines on the walls of savage caves at one 
end of the scale and the Sistine Madonna at the other end. We have decorative 
art, with the zigzag ornament on prehistoric pottery at one end of the scale and 
the Parthenon frieze at the other end. We need to keep constantly before us as 
teachers that it is creative ac- 
tivity of mind in each of these 
divisions of study that we are to 
endeavor to bring out in the chil- 
dren in the public schools. 
Now, the particular line of art 
work and art educational effort 
about which I have been asked 
to speak is that of representative 
art. What bearing have these 
thoughts about art which we 
have just been considering upon 
representative drawing as taught 
in the public schools? What} 
really creative element can enter 
into representative work ? 
Now let me turn to a prolific| 
field for creative art work—to| 
the nature study and the natural 
science that are coming so gen- 
erally into the schools. 
I have here two different ren-| 
derings of the common Canada| 
thistle. Figure 8 is copied from 
a drawing by Professor Sprague, 
a generally recognized authority] 
in the making of botanical plates. 
Fi. 4.The thistle of the artist. From the strictly scientific stand- point, the standpoint professedly| 
assumed in the teaching of natural science in the schools, it is an excellent draw-| 
ing. The scientific attitude toward plant life is aggressive and inquisitorial. To 
the scientific thought all facts, being facts, are in a certain sense equally impor-| 
tant; hence in this representation of the thistle you see all the visible details of its} 
structure delineated with absolute impartiality and so given equal prominence,| 
The whole amounts to a strictly impersonal and statistical statement of observed] 
facts. The leaves of the thistle are of such a shape, in such proportion, ranged in| 
such an order on the vertical stem. Their outlines have sharp protuberances, as 
noted. The scales of the flower involucre are arranged in the manner shown, etc, 
The material facts of the plant are there. Except for our knowing that drawing: 
do not grow but must be made by human hands, there is no suggestion here that 
   
-P-A-G-E-435
  ART DECORATIONS IN SCHOOLROOMS. 1393 
any human mind has been in the least concerned with that thistle. In short, it is 
a statement of nature’s facts, with no evident human element in it. It serves its 
own special purpose well, but that purpose was not an artistic purpose, and the 
result is not art; for representation in art is the visible embodiment of inward 
spiritual experience. .

Figure 4 is an artistic treatment of the same plant, where we see not simply 
facts as facts, but facts as they are felt by a live human being with eyes and 
imagination, and so we have here the combined forbiddingness and delicate 
  attractiveness of this live, contradictory pasture weed. I remember that when I 
was a boy chasing unruly cows through fields grown over with this particular 
plant, the prickliness, which was meant for its natural defense from all such 
destructive elements as cows and boys, made much more impression upon my bare 
legs than the delicacy of its form and color made upon my eyes. But time has

averaged up the two impressions into a happy ‘‘composite” such as is expressed 
for you here. See how the silky tuft of clustered flowers that nurse the plant’s 
young seeds is surrounded by the spiny leaves as if by a guard of grim soldiers.

accurate outline, where the draftsman confined himself strictly to the facts in car-

of lumber and nails. 
Figure 6 shows the same house as it looked to another person who thought of it 
not as a mere aggregate of wood and metal, but as a poet’s old home, a center for 
happy reminiscence and beautiful thought, The lumber is all there and the per-

feeling has entered into both the thought and the rendering, and the result, simple 
as it is, is a real creation, embodying forth a happy conception of the old gambrel- 
roofed house in the artist’s mind. 
Figures 7 and 8 show two modes (literal and imaginative) of treatment of the 
_ same bit of country landscape. Figure 7 sets down roadway and house simply as

opographical facts. Figure 8 is the outcome of real interest in the house as being 
little home, a place for the affections to cluster about and for memory to.return to. 
Figures 9 and 10 show you still another form of what I mean by the creative 
lement in representative drawing. Figure 9 is the bare, impersonal statement of 
ow the outlines of land and sea and sky presented themselves to the eye of an

ybserver at a given point on the shore. The statement is accurate, but the result 
is ugly and uninteresting. We will suppose our artist really loved the seashore 
md wished to make somebody else understand how he felt about it. He walked 
ong the shore till he came to another point where the outlines of the same

eneral features of the landscape could be made (as in fig. 10) toembody his inward 
conception of the real spirit of the place. Possibly he could not find any one 
spot where the shore line and the boats and the’old mooring post all were in 
he position most helpful to his purpose; in that case he may have put the post in 
ot just where he saw it with his physical eye, but where he saw it with his mind’s

eye. The result is that that bit of characteristic detail stands not as a kodal 
would have left it, a great, ugly blemish on the scene, but a delicate indication o! 
relative distances, making the passing boat seem farther away and suggesting a‘ 
once to the imagination a broad level of smooth water stretching out toward thi 
distant background.

Fig. 11, with its assemblage of objects incongruous both as to size and to ch

between them. They do not make each other more interesting or pleasing; thei

suggesting no idea to the observer. Good grouping is the creation of a new who. 
which embodies thought and feeling. This group is evidently bad. 
Fig. 12 shows a number of objects that indeed might have interassociations 
an attractive sort, but you feel uncertain whether the person who made the dra’ 
ing had any definite conception and purpose or not. The outlines of the grou 
are ugly because of the ‘‘scattered” arrangement of the separate members. I

fig. 13, on the contrary, we see the distinct pleasure that somebody has taken in 
the same pieces of fruit; we see’‘now, as we did not see before, how those plump 
curves stand for firm pulp and sweet juice; now that one thing is shown as par- 
tially behind or above its neighbor, we see that the objects really do occupy space, 
that they are solid and not merely flat images. The long, sleek lines of the 
banana make the chubbiness of the apple and the dimples of the pear all the 
pleasanter to the eye, and vice versa. Each item in the group is more beautiful 
and more suggestive to the fancy because of its associations with the other items, 
and the whole is not simply their sum, but their product. It not only gives us 
botanical information, but also gives us somebody’s thought about this bit of the 
vegetable kingdom and quietly reminds us what a pleasant way mother earth has 
of bringing forth her fruits in due season.

Look for a moment at this bit of medizval architecture (Fig. 14), the old gate of 
Basle. This we shall all agree was a genuine creation. The builder had to meet 
a practical problem of ingress and egress and defense against enemies. His 
inward conception of what a city gate should be—solid, serious, dignified, at once 
protecting toward its own citizens and forbidding toward intruders—took this 
      
Fic. 13.—A group showing relation and unity. 
outward embodiment in stone. The gate is therefore an art creation in the true 
sense—the outward and visible expression of invisible spirit. 
But let us see what there is in this old gate which art workers to-day have to 
work with (Fig. 15); cylinders; prisms, square and hexagonal; pyramids, square 
and hexagonal; the very same forms that we to-day are trying to lead the children 
to understand so that they also may use them in creating new forms of use and 
beauty. It was through the old-time builder’s thorough knowledge of the essential 
characteristics of these common type forms that he was enabled to use them ina 
vigorous and beautiful way and make them embody his thought of dignity, 
strength, protection, and defiance. It must be through the child’s understanding 
of these same eternal types, if at all, that he in turn will be enabled to use either 
these basal types, or things resembling the types, in the creating forth of his own 
growing thoughts and ideals. In either fine art or industrial art the understanding 
of the type forms is absolutely necessary as a foundation upon which the creative 
imagination is to build. 
It is a common experience to find educators agreeing that refined feeling for
-P-A-G-E-440
  1398 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
composition (that is, for the delicate relations of part to part whereby each 
strengthens the best of the others and makes all into a single harmonious whole), 
while necessary to fine art, is entirely irrelevant to such drawing as can be done in 
connection with nature study and with models and objects in the schoolroom, 
But is that quite true? I think the best answer to the claim that scientific draw- 
ings must be just bald, bare statements of fact is to be found in the drawings that 
Mr. William Hamilton Gibson actually does make. I earnestly commend his 
books and his articles in Harper’s Magazine to your careful study. I have afew 
of his original drawings here to show you: ‘‘ The Beetles’ Orchestra,” ‘‘ The Bees 
Harvest,” ‘‘ The Brown Thrasher,” and ‘‘ The Harebells.” Nothing could be more 
exquisitely accurate than these drawings. They tell us all the facts that can be 
told without dissecting the forms and mapping out their inward anatomy; and 
they tell us a great deal besides. They show us not simply the details of propor- 
tion and articulation, as these might be learned from specithens impaled on pins 
in a case sprinkled with corrosive sublimate, but also the life of the things, their 
happy, busy life, with all its associations of sunshine and soft winds and sweet 
odors and juices of blossoms in the field. This is, after all, the very best kind of 
“scientific ” drawing; and it may well remind us that while this kind of bread for 
the spiritual life is possible and practicable, we ought not to turn our backs upon 
it and feed the children on stones. 
This bit of verse, whose author I do not know, seems to me to embody the spirit 
of Mr. Gibson’s drawings: 
Innocent eyes, not ours, 
‘Were made to look on flowers, 
Eyes of small birds and insects small. 
Morn after summer morn 
The sweet rose on her thorn 
Opens her bosom to them all. 
The last and least of things 
That soar on quivering wings 
Or creep among the grasses, out of sight, 
Has just as clear a right 
To its appointed portion of delight 
As queens or kings! 
If we only rightly apprehend the matter, there is no need for any antagonism 
between science teaching and art teaching in the schools. There surely can be no 
such antagonism when it is once clearly understood that nature is the realm of the 
material and art the realm of the spiritual. The spiritual is largely conditioned 
by the material, but not evolved out of it. So art work is closely related to 
nature and yet is quite distinct from nature. You can never arrive at art, as 
some people vainly imagine, just through the incidental use of drawing as a means 
of graphic record of observations in nature study and other school lessons. As 
art teachers and directors we want to stand by our faith in art in the schools, not 
as just the servant of the sciences of matter, but as the visible embodiment of the 
highest and best thought of the child who is studying about matter. There should, 
it is true, be the closest relation all through the school course between the art 
instruction and the other lines of instruction; but let us see clearly, and make 
others see clearly, that correlation between art and the other subjects should mean 
not so much the utilizing of what is spiritual for the sake of greater gains in the 
material, but rather the utilizing of all gainsin the realm of the material for the 
nourishment and upbuilding of the spiritual in the individual child. For (as we 
have been reminded a few moments ago in our glance over past history) it is just 
this spiritual element in individual men which hasin each generation kept human 
society in some degree above the mere animal level of eating and sleeping. It is 
this spiritual element in individual men on which our whole hope of a higher race 
development in the future and a nobler human society must rest.

If we will only recognize thus clearly what art is and what art education means, 
e can bring about a perfect practical reconciliation of what is essentially true in 
he two great schools of educational thought that so often meet in conflict as they 
id in Cleveland. Those educators who place their emphasis on the giving of 
cess to the accumulated embodiments and products of the best life and thought 
the ages are right in that emphasis. Those educators who demand that child- 
ood shall be considered not vaguely in the mass, but intelligently and sympathetic- 
ly in each individual, are right in that demand. I believe it is through art 
lucation that it can best be demonstrated that these two educational essentials 
e not antagonistic, nor even inconsistent; rather that, taking each in its best 
mse, they are necessary to each other. The more the laboratory psychologists 
mind us of the ways in which spirit is fettered and tied down by material con- 
‘itions, the more keenly we shall realize that the child’s spirit needs to be brought

to closer relationship to the very best of man’s spiritual life which can be made 
cessible to him to lift him uphigher. If it is our duty to give him a share of the 
aterial benefits derivable from centuries of mechanical invention and industrial 
ill, it can not be any less our duty to give him a share of the spiritual benefits 
rivable from centuries of noble thought, refinement of feeling, and happy 
thusiasm for the beautiful. So we as art directors should cordially welcome 
e new movement for schoolroom decoration. We hope as a result of it that 
thoolrooms will more and more surround the impressionable young life of the 
ildren with immortal reminders of what noble men before them have found in 
e and made out of life.

We who are battling for art in education should, with equal courage, fling our 
shaft—our belief in the spiritual nature of man—into the thick of the opposin; 
hosts that are now clamoring for the supremacy of the material forces in educ: 
tion, and with a sublime faith struggle forward through all misunderstanding, 
distrust, and antagonism, until we reach the goal of all true education, the pout 
where the real shall be interpreted by the ideal, and the two be harmoniously 
blended in the education of every child. 
Tuer PLace or ART EDUCATION IN GENERAL EpucaTION. 
Delivered by John S. Clark in Denver, July, 1895. 
One of the greatest gains made during the half century now closing is the 
clearer insight of men into the meaning and the implications of evolution. Theré 
was a time when the newly discovered facts of the past history of the earth and 
its creatures, seen dimly and without much relation to other facts, staggered all 
but the most courageous minds with the vastness and ominousness of the problems 
they involved; but as years have gone by men have come to see the same giganti 
and enigmatic facts in clearer mental perspective and under brighter light. No 
the philosophy of evolution, as Dr. John Fiske and others clearly proclaimed it 
years ago, and as Henry Drummond has lately so admirably reaffirmed it in his 
work on the Ascent of Man, is the common possession of most thoughtful 
people. This evolutionary history of the world of man is only the scientific 
detailed tracing out of the means and ways by which there has been brough 
about the stupendous fact of man’s place in the scale of creation, which kee: 
philosophic speculation had long ago made him conscious of, even while unabl 
to understand or account for it. The theologian of three centuries ago ceitated 
in the old Hebrew phrase: ‘‘ When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers 
the moon, and the stars, which Thou hast ordained—what is man, that Thou a: 
mindful of him?” But to-day, in the light of evolutionary science, the thought 
takes a different accent: ‘‘When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers. 
the moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained—what is man, that Thou a: 
mindful of him? * * * Thou madest him to have dominion over the works o! 
Thy hand; Thou hast put all things under his feet.” 
Whichever road we travel—the old path of ontological speculation, or the ne 
path of scientific investigation —we come out upon the same intellectual hilltop} 
namely, the thought that man, as a physical being, is the consummate product 1 
material creation, while, as a spiritual being, he is the appointed master o: 
material creation and the beginner of a new world of spiritual growth ané 
spiritual creation. 
The essential, distinguishing fact about him is his more direct relationshiy 
through his personal feelings and desires to the divine—that is, to the eterna] 
spiritual reality of the universe—than exists in the world of matter around him 
which can only passively reflect the divine. 
I shall assume that we agree to start out from this standpoint in considerin, 
the question before us to-day; for, in order to think to any real purpose abou’ 
the place of art education in general education, we should first obtain a clear ideg 
of the relation of education itself to human development, and then the place which 
the arts of the race—literature, music, painting, sculpture, and architecture—hol 
in the development and training of spiritual man. 
The first proposition that I have to offer you is one upon whose acceptance 04 
rejection the general character of the whole scheme ‘of public education mus; 
logically depend. It is as follows: 
Proposition I.—That the human soul is a self-acting spiritual entity, whick 
is more completely a revelation of the divine spirit behind all which is thay   
 
-P-A-G-E-443
  ART DECORATIONS IN SCHOOLROOMS. 1401 
is shown in the material world; and that this soul or spiritual entity, when 
properly developed, dominates man’s physical powers, making them and the 
material world subservient to itself. 
We hear much in these days about the human soul as having no demonstrable 
existence per se, as being merely the sum of the material forces of the universe, 
and as possessing only such powers as are induced in it by the play of these mate- 
rial forces upon the bodily organism. This standpoint is practically assumed by 
that portion of modern empirical psychology which has been aptly described as 
“psychology without a soul.” Ribot, in his work on German Psychology of 
To-day, accepts this phrase (‘‘ psychology without a soul”) as fairly describing, in 
its negative aspect, that new psychology which confines itself to studying forms 
and-conditions of mental action without any regard to the question of what the 
soul is or even whether there be a soul, and which treats psychic forces as merely 
differentiations from the material forces studied in physics, chemistry, and animal 
physiology. 
Of course it can not be claimed that the mind or the soul is independent of the 
physical organism. We can not conceive of the human mind as being able to 
annul the laws of external matter. What I wish to claim is simply that the mind, 
being an entity in itself, has a certain power of control over that very material 
mechanism (the brain) whose conformation and functions condition it; and that 
it has also a certain original power of combining with and taking advantage of 
the forces of the material world so as to modify their actions and transform their 
applications. 
Nor is it intended to deny that the senses are the appointed gateway through 
which we can come near to the things and the forces of the outside universe, or 
through which they can come near to us, and furnish our minds material to work 
with. What I do wish to remind you of is the fact that the spiritual entity behind 
and above all the man’s sense-organs, that to which sense-impression appeals, is 
the thing of first and greatest importance. 
You remember the famous aphorism of Leibnitz: ‘‘ There is nothing in the intel- 
lect which was not previously in the senses—except the intellect itself!” 
Asa matter of fact, the stoutest champions of the theory of soul as a combina- 
tion of differentiated physical energies can not keep their footing on its slippery 
ground. They can not explain, or indeed fully express, their own theory without 
falling back upon assumptions which are inconsistent with that theory. * * * 
The fact is, the whole scheme of experimental psychology or any dilutions of 
it—which aim to reduce mental phenomena to unmediated physical energies orig- 
inating in the forces of the material world, and so to dispense with self-activity 
in the intellectual life of man—is (as Professor Ladd has pointed out with such 
clearness and vigor) based wholly on an assumption of the self-active intellect 
itself; that is, on the purely mental hypothesis of the existence of atoms and mole- 
cules, through which the primal energy can transmit and manifest itself. And 
this hypothesis is a pure synthesis of the mind, So we have the paradox of human 
beings denying that the human mind has any real essential existence as a self- 
acting entity, and yet asserting that the ultimate basis of all so-called mental 
phenomena is traceable to physical forces acting in certain minute units of matter, 
whose very existence is, after all, merely a convenient conjecture of this depend- 
ent physical mind itself! 
‘We must remember that this question as to whether the soul is a self-acting 
entity or merely a higher differentiation of molecular energies is more than justa 
curious problem for the biologist and the metaphysician. 
It has a distinct bearing on the problem of child education. If mind develop- 
ment is taken to be merely a matter of automatic transformation of physical force 
through sense activity into thought activity, the general spirit and plan of educa-  
-P-A-G-E-444
  
  1402 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
tion (which aims at mind development) will naturally be quite different from its 
spirit and plan when it is conceived of as an appeal to a spiritual entity, a self- 
determining ego, with powers both of assimilative and creative self-activity, capa- 
ble of being indefinitely developed according to the individuality of that ego.! 
Let mé not be misunderstood as underestimating the value of contemporary 
physiological psychology to education. Understood in itsright relation to educa- 
tional problems, it can be of great practical assistance in educational work. The 
actual effect of bodily conditions on mental activities is nowadays being bet- 
ter understood than ever before. Our practical appreciation of this under- 
standing is shown in improved systems of ventilating, heating, and lighting 
schoolrooms, and in thoughtfully planned courses of physical culture. The 
actual importance of individual sense experience, as basis and material- for 
mental activity, is nowadays better understood than ever before. And our prac- 
tical appreciation of this understanding is shown in the great movements for 
form study, for manual training, and for the experimental study of natural 
science. The more we understand of the subtle interrelations between the 
physical and the mental, the more directly we can go to the point in class-room 
teaching without so much futile misdirection of effort as has often been 
inevitable in the past. But the danger involved in this new enthusiasm for 
physiological psychology, or the study of ‘‘consciousness content-wise,” is the 
danger lest it be taken to cover the whole educational problem, when it really 
covers only the lesser half of the problem. Educators to-day are in danger 
of overlooking that larger factor, ‘‘ consciousness function-wise,” in the child, 
which, though it can not be measured or weighed or tabulated in any sort of 
psychological statistics, has more weight in the determination and direction 
of mental activity than all physical and material factors combined. Practical 
education should not be suffered to fall into the mistaken, exclusive extreme into 
which is seems to be drifting, where circumstance and environment, acting auto- 
matically on the brain, are reckoned as all effective, and the elements of personal 
effort and personal responsibility on the pupil’s part are hardly recognized. This 
extreme is, of course, easily comprehensible as a reaction from the old-time formal 
teaching. But either extreme is bad. And as a safeguard against the current 
tendency to suppose that sense contact with the things of the natural world may 
be trusted to solve the whole problem of right spiritual development, I feel that 
a firm stand should be made for the recognition of the individual soul with its 
1 When we have once separated matter from thought, when we have called matter what is 
perceived, in opposition to thought or what perceives, we must not eat our own words or swal- 
low our own thoughts by saying that, for all we know, matter may think or mind may be touched 
and handled. 
From this point of view I call materialism no more thanagrammatical blunder. It is the sub- 
stitution of anominative for an accusative, or of an active for a passive verb. At first wemean 
by matter what is perceived, not, indeed, by itself, but by its qualities; butin the end it ismade 
to mean the very opposite, namely, what perceives, and is thus supposed to lay hold of and 
strangle itself. What causes the irritation of our senses is confounded with what receives these 
irritations; what is perceived with what perceives; what is conceived with what conceives; 
what is named with the namer. It is admitted on all sides that there never could be such a 
thing as an object, or as matter, except when it has been perceived by a subject or amind. And 
yet we are asked by materialists to believe that the perceiving subject, or the mind, is really 
the result of a long-continued development of the object or of matter. This is a logical somer- 
sault which it seems almost impossible to perform, and yet it has been performed again and 
again in the history of philosophy._F. Max fiiller, The Science of Thought. 
‘While mind and matter may both be called substances, they are different kinds of existences. 
‘We know them by different organs, the one by self-consciousness, the other by the senses. 
Again we know them as possessing altogether different properties; the one as perceiving, rea- 
soning, feeling, willing; the other as extended and exercising energy. The properties of the 
one can not be predicated of the other. Thinking and feeling have no place in that stone; nor 
have softness, hardness, or gravity in our souls.—Dr. James McCosh, in Preface to Ribot’s Ger- 
man Psychology of To-Day.

f-activities, developed through and responding to, but not derived from, the 
laterial forces of nature, as of the first and greatest importance in educational 
ychology and in practical educational work. 
iMy second propositions: 
Proposition II.—That man, by virtue of this self-acting soul, becomes, in his 
highest estate, not only a transformer of the material conditions which sur- 
round him, but also an actual creator of new spiritual values of an altruistic 
character; hence his arts. 
can take time merely to suggest in the briefest fashion how man is a trans- 
mer of the material conditions round about him, and how his activities are 
bued with the altruistic character; how he, and he alone, in contrast to all 
her living creatures, sets to work with conscious and deliberate foresight to 
lange those very material facts which, toa certain extent, experimentally con- 
ion his range and mode of inward life; and how his activities, crystallized into 
s, have changed the face of the earth and the semblance of many of its crea- 
res into something quite unlike their original estate, making nature immensely 
re contributory to his own well-being. 
lan’s activities may be classified into two divisions, the useful arts and the fine 
‘he useful arts exercise his creative powers chiefly on but one plane of his exist- 
ice and that the lowest, namely, the physical. While they mark a nation’s 
ward growth to a certain limited extent, they do not of themselves embody all 
our race experience, nor even the best of our race experience. 
he fine arts (poetry, music, painting, sculpture, and architecture) are the 
rms in which the higher life of man embodies itself. It is to these fine arts that 
always have to look in order to learn in what way and to what degree a people 
ve climbed up above the level of mere animals, clever enough to secure good 
gs to eat, effective shelters from the weather, and convenient coverings for 
‘ir bodies. 
na certain sense it may be said that there is a large part of the best of our race 
rience which never gets embodied in any tangible material form at all, but 
s for the creation of new conditions rather than new things, refining and ele- 
ing the quality of personal character and daily life, but never shaping itself 
o any explicit forms of art creation. It is not quite true that these particular 
ritual energies are unmet with in the fine arts—for, in indirect ways, the most 
amonplace toil helps make the work of art possible (we all remember our 
irsery stories of how the farmer and the miller help prepare the child’s break- 
t; for him),—and, in a still higher sense, every noble inward life helps create a 
re healthy spiritual atmosphere for all other men to breathe. 
ut the fact remains that if we would direct our thought to the definite, tangible 
ords of man’s higher life, we must look for those records in the various forms 
ithe fine arts. 
‘reative activity which brings forth the useful arts is service rendered in laying 
foundation of material civilization. Creative activity which brings forth the

_ ancestry, and which works for self, and his spiritual nature, which is altruist; 
and which is impelling him forward to work for others. Man’s arts are at on 
the evidence and the result of this conflict. 
This is the unanimous affirmation of science, history, and religion. 
My next proposition is: 
Proposition III.—The history of civilization is the record of man’s progre| 
in the creation of spiritual values through the subjection of his own anim| 
nature and surrounding material nature to the service of his spiritual nee: 
and ideals—hence the world of art. For the arts of man are not merely in 
dental to civilization. They are the supreme products of his creative spiritu 
activities, the condition and promise of higher civilization. 
.It can not be too strongly emphasized that art is not a mere incidental phase 
the life of man. Some people have an idea that it is so; that it simply happen 
in successive ages that people spent their playtime in building with blocks on| 
large scale, making ‘‘ stone doils,” and composing tunes, rhymes, and fantas 
tales—-occupations whose remains are well enough to interest the idler of to-daj 
but which have no solid significance for practical people. 
This notion of art is as far as possible from the truth of the matter. The fal 
is that in every age man’s creative energies have embodied themselves in art for: 
inorder to satisfy the irresistible divine instinct of creation within him, and mal 
a way in which to share with his fellows his inward personal experiences. 
The fact that we ourselves stand to-day where we do stand in the progressi 
march of civilization is due in no small measure to the earlier fact that gene: 
tions of men before us, who lived and loved and suffered and hoped, and w 
wrought their own wonderment and desires, their aspirations and their hopes, in| 
art forms, have bequeathed to us their arts as their richest and most benefice 
legacy. We hold this legacy now in the form of the world’s great epic and ly: 
poems, and in its fiction and dramas, instinct with human passion and human aspi 
tion, peopled with personalities of man’s own imaginative creation, even more r 
in their influence to-day than the shadowy names of history. We holditin the fo: 
of the great treatises on philosophy, government, and the sciences, the very c 
densation and crystallization, as it were, of the human intellect. We hold it 
the world’s bibles, the legacy of the religious thought of the race. We hold t 
legacy again in the form of the world’s great music—the symphonies that s 
make our world palpitate with exquisite harmonies once conceived by hum 
genius, the oratorios and operas, and the songs that, like unquenchable torch 
kindle the souls of each successive generation of human kind with fires of joyo 
ness, of patriotic ardor, of religious ecstasy. 
And we hold the legacy yet again in the form of monuments and temples, cat! 
drals and majestic colossi, eloquent of the questionings and longings of souls f: 
ing the great mysteries of life and death. We hold it in the form of treasur| 
remains of sculptures, eloquent of old-time insight into the divineness of bea’ 
and old-time delight in such insight. We hold it in the form of the world’s gr 
paintings, eloquent of all man’s-widest range of interests and sympathies, of } 
love for the good and the right, of the gradually clearing vision which has enab]] 
him to see the divine in nature and the still higher manifestations of the divij 
in humanity, and to make the vision manifest to all mankind. 
, On another gccasion I shall discuss the bearings of art education upon the la! 
problems of the day, and through labor upon all the interests of social well-bei 
On this occasion I can only remind you of the immense significance of art fr 
the economic point of view. 
Now, standing as we do to-day in the possession of this art legacy from the men| 
the past, can we rationally minimize it, and consider the child merely as a parti 
larly high differentiation of physical energies, the passive subject of nature, mol

   and played upon at nature’s mercy? I tell you nay. We must see and own and 
practically act upon a truer conception of the mind of man, and upon a larger 
vision of the place of man in creation’s scale, such as Dr. John Fiske brought out at 
Harvard two weeks ago in his Phi Beta Kappa address. Dr. Fiske then gave utter- 
ance to words that are to be forever memorable in the great discussion upon which 
thinking men are now entering with reference to man and his destiny in the light 
of evolution, and he has kindly sent me his exact words for use on this occasion. 
In speaking of psychical man and contrasting him with all that preceded him, Dr. 
Fiske said: \ 
“The physical variations by which man is distinguished from apes are not great. 
His physical relationship with the ape is closer than that between cat and dog, 
which belong to different families of the same order. It is like that between cat 
and leopard, or between dog and fox, different genera in the same family. But 
the moment we consider the minds of man and ape the gap between the two is 
immeasurable. Mr. Mivart has truly said that with regard to their total value in 
nature the difference between man and ape transcends the difference between ape 
and a blade of grass. I should be disposed to go further and say that while for 
zoological man you can not erect a distinct family from that of the chimpanzee 
and orang, on the other hand, for psychological man you must erect a distinct 
kingdom; nay, you must even dichotomize the universe, putting man on one side 
and all things else on the other.” 
It is this stupendous sense of the soul’s reality—that is, its individuality and its 
self-activity—that we need to emphasize in these days of talk about the soul asa 
derivation from sense activities. 
Let me ask all those who believe there is nothing in the mind but the product of 
the senses, Whence came these arts of man? Can you assume for their existence 
anything less than the existence in the mind of man of a creative power superior 
to the physical forces that surround him, a power which appropriates through 
the action of the senses these physical forces and applies them to its own spiritual 
ends? i 
I desire to leave this point with emphasis on the fact that these arts of man are 
not mere incidents in his development; they are the sum of his existence, that 
“toward which the whole creation moves.” 
My next proposition is: 
Proposition IV.—That every child is born heir to two world environments 
(the material world of nature and the spiritual world of man), and also the 
possessor of aptitudes for ever-expanding assimilative and creative activities 
of his own. 
We have seen that man is surrounded by two great world environments. These 
two world environments act upon the child, each in its own way. The material 
world of nature, the world of cloud and rock, of multitudinous plant life and 
swarming animal life, makes constant appeal to the new human being, through 
his physical sensibilities and physical interests, as one who is the crowning prod- 
‘act of its own marvelous cycles of evolutionary energy. On the other hand, the 
spiritual world of man, the world of his arts, makes constant appeal to the new 
human being, through his spiritual susceptibilities and spiritual interests, as one 
who is capable of all that the race is capable of and, as a new being, has endless x 
future possibilities of personal creative activity. The upward growth of this new 
human being we find dependent upon the balance between his responses to the 
influences of these two world environments, and it is here that we, as educators, 
should take careful note of how these two environments affect the child. His 
animal nature, obedient to the laws of natural evolution in the physical world, is 
absorptive, selfish. It grasps. It appropriates for the good of self. This is 
atuare’s provision for the perpetuation of the race. His spiritual nature, on the
-P-A-G-E-448
  1406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
other hand, obedient to the laws of spiritual life, is creative, altruistic. It makes 
for the good of others. This is the divine provision for the development of human- 
ity. In so far, and in so far alone, as his spiritual response to and utilization 
of the influences of his spiritual environment predominate over his submission to 
the influences of his material environment, he grows toward that high Meee 
destiny which we can but faintly begin to forecast. 
If it were true that children were only little animals, subject to nature’s laws 
and possessing minds that work merely automatically under the stimuli of natural 
phenomena, it would be well enough to do as some modern educators advocate— 
simply surround the child with pleasing natural objects, and trust that their sen- 
suous attractiveness will insure attention and observation, and that these will 
somehow of themselves evolve desire for what is truly best and secure energetic 
action along right lines, toward high ends. 
The unfortunate fact is, however, that unless we make a strong appeal to chil- 
dren through the spiritual side of their nature, they are liable to respond only 
in terms of the animal. As most practical teachers know, we are likely to be 
brought up standing by the child’s frankly materialistic measures of the universe. 
Those of you who have read the recent autobiography of Frances Power Cobbe 
will recall her experience when, returning to her country home for a visit, after 
several years of absence, she met a grown-up young man, who had been a pupil 
in the little village school organized and enthusiastically taught by herself. 
“Well, Andrew,” said Miss Cobbe, ‘show much do you remember of all my 
lessons?” 
“Ah, ma’am, then, never a word!” 
«O, Andrew, Andrew! And have you forgotten all about the sun, the moon 
and stars, the day and night, and the seasons?” 
Andrew scratched his head and light dawned upon his cotintenance. 
**Oh, no, ma’am!” he declared, ‘‘I do remember now. And you set them on 
the schoolroom table, and Mars was a red gooseberry, and I ate him.” 
t evidently will not do to trust too far or too implicitly to the ‘‘ automatic” 
transformation of sense impressions into elevated thought. 
Jacobi has truly said, ‘‘Nature conceals God; man reveals God.” 
Now, is there any provision in the universe for helping to insure the predomi- 
nance of man’s spiritual development and his consequent progressive mastership 
of the'material world? 
There is; and this leads to the next proposition, one of the most significant of 
all the great significant truths of evolution: 
Proposition V.—The long period of infancy and youth, when the mind is 
especially susceptible to the influences of environments, and when the active 
powers are most easily directed, is a special provision for the unceasing devel- 
opment of man’s spiritual qualities and creative activities. 
Dr. John Fiske was the first to point out clearly to contemporary thought the 
important fact that physical evolution had come to an end in the production of 
physical man; and that further play of the evolutionary process must be sought 
in psychical man. He also pointed out how this psychical development was con- 
ditioned upon psychical or spiritual man making his physical being and his phys- 
ical environment subject to himself. Dr. Fiske has also supplemented these 
important contributions to evolutionary philosophy by another of no less impor- 
tance—one which can not be ignored in any attempt to place education upon a 
truly philosophical basis. I refer to his statement that the long period of depend- 
ent infancy and youth in the human child, as contrasted with the parental provi- 
sions for existence in the lower animals, is evidence of a distinct plan for the 
increasing development of psychic life in the human race, through a special pro- 
vision in the life of every individual of a plastic condition of mind, whereby the
-P-A-G-E-449
ART DECORATIONS IN SCHOOLROOMS. 1407 
umulations of ever-expanding human experience could be handed over from 
eration to generation through ever-expanding faculties for self-activity in 
eiving, and then for ever-expanding powers of self-activity in creating for the 
efit of human life. 
can not stop to discuss the immense significance of this evolutionary view of 
psychic development of the race in its bearimg upon education. If nature’s 
visions in this respect mean anything, I do not think it will be questioned but 
+ they are intended for the ever-increasing development of the psychical or 
ritual man rather than of the physical or animal man. 
nd this leads to my final proposition: 
Proposition V Education should be the fullest possible utilization of the 
plastic period of infancy and youth, not only for cultivating a knowledge of 
the child’s two-world environments, but also and emphatically for training to 
skill in the creative activities along art lines, as the highest contribution of 
the individual to social well-being. 
‘he best education means simply the best utilization of this plastic period of the 
d’s life for the development and training of that in him which most deserves 
e developed and trained. 
say ‘‘that which most deserves to be developed and trained,” assuming that 
everything in the child’s inherited make-up is of the same value. I take it to 
part of the responsibility laid upon mature men to weigh the various ele- 
ts of human nature as fairly as they can, and learn to put educational 
hasis on the more worthy of those elements. In our lesser task of guiding the 
gressive development of plant and animal life, we have for a long time made 
e such selection. Man’s effort has been, not simply to help the earth bring 
th more flowers and fruit of precisely the same sort as would grow without 
, but to put his intellect and his will in cooperation with the powers outside 
, so as to transform existing conditions of growth, to the end that still more 
utiful flowers and even more delicious fruits may be brought into existence. 
k at our greenhouses, our orchards, and our market gardens for the result. 
en the task set us is to help work out the divine purpose in the higher devel- 
aent, not of vegetables or brute beasts, but of new human beings, there is not 
but more need that we should consider deeply the animal nature of the child 
the one hand and his spiritual nature on the other, and how the former can 
be utilized in the full development of the latter. 
‘the supreme purpose of education, so far as that education lies within our 
trol, should be the development of the child’s capacity for unselfish creative 
vity and for spiritual enjoyment. The development of his other capacities 
ald be treated with regard to the manner and: degree of contributing toward 
supreme end. 
intentionally use this term ‘‘creation” rather than ‘‘expression,” when refer- 
to the supreme form of human activity, because I believe we ought to keep 
ind the thought that the highest activity goes beyond mere ‘expression "— 
is, the mere statement of what is—and becomes ‘‘creation;” that is to say, 
uctive action—action productive of new things or new conditions. This is a 
t that I wish particularly to emphasize, the distinction between expression

  1408 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. * 
This idea of education as training for creative activity includes all that w: 
best in our earlier notions of the purpose of education. It includes the acquir 
ment of stores of knowledge, for, of course, it is only upon the basis of a know! 
edge of what is that man can proceed to make things or conditions better. I] 
also includes the development of individual power, because, of course, the mai 
who can command himself is the only one who can effectively command matter oj 
force. But the mere ‘‘acquirement of knowledge” may be as worthless as th 
accumulation of gold pieces in a miser’s strong box, and the mere ‘“‘ developme: 
of power” may be as worthless as the development of power in a finished engin 
that stands unconnected with any sort of working machinery. The new ideal 
education as training for creative activity includes both the effort after knowledg| 
and the effort after power, and adds to these a purpose. That purpose is the ac’ 
ive betterment of the world and the progressive elevation of human living. 
And this view of education necessitates direct training not only for creati 
thought, but also for skill in creating the best embodiments of such thought. I 
implies not simply keeping the child’s senses tickled with a succession of nov 
and pleasant impressions, which he may express or record in any fashion th: 
comes easiest, but also in giving him opportunity for and guidance in creati 
activities where he can utilize his impressions so that he may gradually attain 
self-command in these activities; so that he may learn to respect positive stan 
ards of technical workmanship, and also learn to hold himself sturdily up towar| 
them in his own endeavors; in other words, so that he may have power in creati’ 
work. 
Now, Ido not wish to be understood here as overlooking or as crushing out t! 
element of the child’s instinctive interest. I believe we ought to study ver| 
thoughtfully and very sympathetically the natural, instinctive interests a: 
desires of the child in planning and conducting educational work. But I belie 
that we should study these interests and desires, not just for the sake of followi: 
their indications of ‘‘the line of least resistance,” but also and much more f 
the sake of utilizing them as means whereby to lead the child out of his prese 
animal self up to a still higher and better human self. As grown-up men ar 
women ourselves, we simply must believe that our measures of life are, on ti 
whole, juster and truer than the child’s own measure of life; else life itself is 
hopeless anticlimax, the dreariest of illusions. The child would naturally pref 
to possess a juicy apple to-day rather than to be owner of

than wisdom and righteousness. No. What we haye to do is neither to impo} 
our own wills arbitrarily and absolutely upon the child’s will, nor yet to fold o 
arms and indolently let him have his head in any direction and to any extent 
likes. Ours should be the more difficult but much more honorable task of reco; 
nizing his feelings and impulses with ready sympathy; of bringing to bear up 
those feelings and those impulses such spiritual influences as will combine wit 
the influences of his natural environment; of developing right powers and habi

with its sculptures was not simply a marble statement of the laws of gravity and of the religio} 
and political opinions of the Athenian State—a material expression of existing facts. It was t 
pringing forth into visible and glorious existence of an entirely new creation: something tl 
had not existed inthe marble quarry, but only in the constructive artistic imagination of mai 
imagination so strong, so clear, so high in its reach, that it could and did command matter to 
obedient service.

and training that we can give in the typical creative activities, to the end that he 
may have not only desire to create but also power to create in terms of art; that, 
besides having good intentions, he may actually do good work. 
The desirability of training a child’s powers of appreciating and enjoying what 
is noble and beautiful in both the world of nature and the world of art, which 
embodies so much of men’s best thought and experience, hardly needs argument. 
Whether regarded by itself, as providing the child with an elevating mode of occu- 
pying leisure hours, or regarded as a step toward practical creative activity on his 
own part, such training, if wisely conducted by tactful guidance rather than by 
prescription and rule, may and should be a fruitful means of rounding out char- 
acter in a wholesome, healthy fashion, and providing beforehand resources of true 
refreshment and lofty inspiration. Such resources of appreciative power are needed. 
both by the artist and by his public; by the man of leisure and by the humblest 
workman. Indeed the balance of need lies with the one whose life is to be almost 
full of commonplace toil, if the improving industrial conditions which give him 
increasing hours of leisure are to actually make his leisure spiritually profitable 
40 him. 
We have hitherto spoken of art in its largest inclusive meaning, comprising lit- 
erature, music, painting, sculpture, and architecture. What is true of art, as a 
whole, in its bearings upon the life of the race and the education of the individual, 
is true of the particular lines of art which are usually referred to when we speak 
of artin education. Artin this sense is understood as applying to modeling, draw- 
ing, and coloring with their special functions in decoration, illustration, and sculp- 
ture, painting, machinery, and building construction and architecture. 
Now there are two great obstacles in the way of establishing true art education 
in our public schools: 
First. The mistaken and belittling notions about art and art education, which 
prevail to so great an extent among professed leaders of educational work, as well 
las on the part of the public. 
Second. The unfamiliarity of the rank and file of teachers with the subject- 
matter and methods of true art instruction. 
Now as to the first obstacle, many educators, when they speak of art, mean merely 
graphic expression, mere diagramming or imitating as a means of stating informa- 
tion. When they speak of art instruction, they mean merely encouraging children 
to make maps, diagrams, and sketches, or models in connection with their lessons in 
arithmetic, geography, physics, and natural history. These apostles of ‘‘free” art 
practically take the ground that the average child can drop into art, as Mr. Wegg 
dropped into poetry, ‘‘in a friendly sort of way,” and that, if he is just given clay, 
la pencil or brush, and a piece of’ paper, and urged to draw or model whatever he 
happens to see, just as he happens to see it, the result is art. This is just like giy- 
ling the untrained and illiterate child paper and pen, telling him to write what- 
lever he thinks, about whatever he pleases, in whatever way occurs to him, and 
calling the result literature. Now, everybody would recognize the absurdity and 
futility of this latter procedure. We all know that the child can not by himself 
volve good literary taste and good literary style out of his own crude, desultory 
thoughts, plus a sheet of paper. There is no such short cut to literature. He 
must indeed write and write and keep on writing, but above all he must read and 
e taught what to read; his mind must be fed from the fruitful store of good 
literature, which already exists, the legacy of accumulated ages of human culture. 
It can not possibly be our best plan to-day to ignore all the progress of the past, 
nd make each child laboriously work out all over again the whole history of 
‘ivilization, Dark Ages included, when he ought to be let into his birthright as 
‘heir of all the ages.” A broader and clearer appreciation on the part of educa- 
ional leaders as to what art itself means as a factor in developing the creative 
ower of the child, and what it stands for in social life to-day, is the first requisite

for the success of art education as a part of public education. As evidence of how 
this great subject is ignored, we have only to refer to the reports of the committee 
of ten and the committee of fifteen; and further I am not aware of any scheme of 
correlation of studies in which the subject is in any way adequately recognized. 
But I believe a change iscoming. Sooner or later it will be seen and practically 
recognized that what man has done in the arts is toa young mind in the formative 
stage what fertile soil is toa young plant. And when that time comes, men will 
no longer try either to cultivate rosebushes on a strictly primeval diet of granite, 
gravel, and rain, or to cultivate human souls on a strictly primeval diet of nature, 
study, and untrammeled frolic.! 
They will accept for the children under their care the advantages that lie in 
being heir of preceding ages, and use these advantages as a means whereby the 
new life may grow up to still higher forms of personal development and productive 
activity. 
The second obstacle to be surmounted (the imperfect equipment of public-school 
teachers for carrying on art instruction in the class rooms) will be done away as 
far and as fast as the leaders come to appreciate the true nature and importance 
of art as a fundamental feature of educational work; for the grade teachers of 
our American public schools are essentially capable and loyal; they are able and 
ready to learn whatever it is necessary for the good of the schools that they should 
learn; but they need definite assistance and guidance. Suitably planned courses 
of study will do much to help; courses arranged not hastily or perfunctorily by 
people with narrow views of the subject and with slight acquaintance with the 
experience of others in similar work, but thoughtfully and intelligently by persons 
who can comprehend both the physical nature and the spiritual nature of the| 
child. Only those who are engaged in this work know how narrow are the limi- 
tations that surround them. The best that exists to-day is but a stepping-stone to} 
what should be done and what can be done as soon as a better understanding of! 
what art means exists among the teachers. Rightly planned courses of study, 
reenforced by suitable working materials and art examples good and abundant, 
to which the children themselves may have ready access, the whole interpreted| 
by a wise and sympathetic supervisor, who knows his subject and who under- 
stands child nature in hearty, affectionate fashion—I tell you, my friends, we have} 
as yet seen only the beginning of what a power art education may and ought to be 
in the inward uplifting to useful and noble work of the successive generations of 
children who pass through the public schools of our land. 
To summarize in a few words the points we have been considering, let us remind| 
ourselves: That evolutionary science, ontological philosophy, and empirical 
psychology, in their truest interpretations, practically agree in declaring that man| 
is the highest of all finite existences, from which proceed self-acting spiritual 
powers; that the arts of man are the embodiment of these spiritual self-activities 
of the race exercised along creative lines; and that, being thus the highest 
activities of the highest of all finite existences, they should be constantly utilized| 
in education, if education has for its distinct aim the development of what is| 
1T heartily believe in the introduction of various lines of nature study into the public schools. 
In city schools particularly, such studies are an indispensable help in bridging the chasm between| 
the child and his natural environments, and giving him at least a suggestive glimpse into the| 
marvels and beauties of the natural world. What Ido object to is the extreme ground taken] 
by some educators (an extreme precisely opposite to that of the old-fashioned word-for-word 
text-book memorizing) wherein it is fancied that the study of nature is educationally all- 
sufficient; that language and number study can be sufficiently and successfully developed as| 
mere incidentals to nature study, and that drawing, used as the handmaid of the natural sciences,} 
can constitute art instruction. Against this misconception of what art means, and what-art 
study ought to be in a course of education, I believe a strong protest should be made.

est in the child, both for himself and for the social life of which he is to form a 
art. 
And now let me say in conclusion that, if I rightly apprehend current educa- 
onal discussion, many of the schemes of correlation or of concentration that are 
ing advocated are based mainly on the consideration of the physical environ- 
ent of the child, the forces of which play upon the brain through the action of 
e senses, and hence are exterior to the child, The result of such schemes is to 
ake the child largely the product of his physical environment. As opposed to 
ese more or less materialistic views of education, I suggest that we take as our 
nter of thought the child himself, with a full comprehension of his creative spir- 
ual nature, and then measure the relative values of educational subjects, accord- 
g as they contribute to the development of his highest possibilities as a creative 
biritual being. By so doing we shall see that the creative activities of the child 
rm the real educational objective, and that the arts of man as ministering to 
ese activities should not be relegated to any incidental place in the arrangement 
studies, but should be practically recognized as the most inclusive, the most 
tal, means we have for centering our educational effort aright; centering it with 
1 its nourishment and all its inspiration upon the soul of the child—upon the 
ild as the heir and the potential master of the world.

INTRODUCTION. ’ 
The authors of ‘‘ Minerva, Jahrbuch der Universitiiten der Welt,” which is the 
chief source of information offered in the following six lists, say that they have 
submitted their work at various stages of completion to different professors of the 
countries mentioned, so that they are assured that their decision as to which of 
the learned institutions of the world should be regarded as universities is upheld 
by the most trustworthy authority. They call their Jahrbuch a collection of 
names of teaching bodies, of universities, or similar institutions of the world. In 
the first edition the authors admitted that. despite the most rigorous search, a 
few of the smaller institutions of the Western Hemisphere escaped their notice. 
In subsequent editions these omissions have been corrected, and libraries, societies, 
and museums added, so that the fifth edition, that of 1895-96, is aremarkably val- 
uable source of information. Since this report of the Bureau of Education con- 
tains direct information concerning the higher institutions of learning in the 
United States, they have been omitted from the following lists, which are devoted 
exclusively to foreign institutions.

CHAPTER XXXIIL. 
EDUCATIONAL MATTERS OF INTEREST IN VARIOUS 
STATES. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Girts TO NoRTHAMPTON, Mass.—A STRIKING RECORD OF BENEFACTIONS. 
[The city of Northampton, Mass., which had in 1890 a population of less than 
15,000 inhabitants, has been the recipient, mainly during the last half century, of 
donations for educational, religious, and charitable purposes amounting in all to 
nearly $4,500,000. The following summary of these donations, and details regard- 
ing the more notable of them have been taken from an address by H. 8. Gere, 
before the Community Club of Northampton, April 13, 1897.] 
The first gift to the town was made in 1783 by Maj. Joseph Hawley, the dis- 
tinguished patriot and statesman, who gave certain lands for the benefit of the 
public schools, These lands have been sold and the income has been yearly 
devoted to the purpose for which they were given. The fund now amounts to 
$3,000. 
The second gift, in which the town has only a joint interest, was made in 1845, 
by Oliver Smith, of Hatfield, the founder of the Smith charities, of which further 
mention will be made later in this paper. 
The third gift was made in 1852, by Jenny Lind Goldschmidt, who had spent her 
honeymoon here on Round Hill. . Just previous to her return to Europe she gave 
a concert in the town hall, the proceeds of which were $936.93. Of this sum she 
gave $700 to the Young Men’s Institute, and that was the beginning of the present 
Clarke Library. The balance she gave to President William Allen, to be disposed 
of in charity. 
Since then gifts to the town, or to public institutions within the town, have 
come in quick succession. ‘ 
One of the most loyal citizens that Northampton ever had was John Clarke. He 
spent his entire life here and was from his boyhood a merchant on Shop Row 
until he became a banker. He was an old-time country storekeeper and had old- 
fashioned ways of living and doing business. He amassed a large fortune, which 
he bestowed upon his native town. The Clarke Library is largely the result of 
his liberality. While living he gave $5,000 for the Memorial Hall Building, and 
$50,000 to the Clarke Institution for Deaf Mutes. By his will he gave $2,000 to 
the Young Men’s Institute, $40,000 to the Clarke Library, and $234,000 to the 
Clarke Institution. 
In addition to the sum given by Mr. Clarke to the library and Memorial Hall, 
there were given by outside parties, through the solicitations of our public- 
spirited citizen his nephew, Christopher Clarke, the sum of $25,000 for the Memo- 
rial Hall Building. Of this sum $5,000 was given by George Bliss, of New York, 
and $3,500 by E. H. R. Lyman, of Brooklyn, both natives of Northampton. 
Charles E. Forbes, a lawyer and ex-judge of the supreme court, left one of the 
largest estates ever acquired in Northampton, all of which he gave to the town 
for the establishment of a library. The trustees received from the executors of 
his estate these sums:

The library building is finely located and was built with reference to the great 
future demands that will be made upon it. This is one of the most useful gifts 
that the town has received. ‘ 
- To aid in maintaining this library Dr. Pliny Earle, for many years the head of 
the State Lunatic Hospital located here, gave his whole estate, amounting to over 
$60,000. 
Cooley Dickinson, of Hatfield, left his entire estate of $71,196 to found the Dick- 
inson Hospital, for the benefit of the inhabitants of Northampton, Hatfield, and 
Whately. 
Whiting Street, of Smiths Ferry, gave $25,000 to the town of Northampton “for 
the relief and comfort of the worthy poor,” and $25,000 more contingent upon the 
decease of certain of his relatives. He also gave $1,000 to Smith College, $1,000 to 
Clarke Institution, and $1,000 for Memorial Hall lot. 
The State Lunatic Hospital was opened to patientsin 1858. The work of building 
occupied two years and three months, and the original cost was $315,000. Exten- 
sive improvements have been made from time to time. The grounds have been) 
enlarged from 175 acres at the outset to nearly 500 acres at the present time. The 
buildings have also been enlarged and improved, so that the entire outlay has been 
$630,550. The hospital has been very ably managed and is now at the height of its 
prosperity and usefulness. 
Florence has contributed its share to the city’s gifts. Samuel L. Hill and Alfred T, 
Lilly have each given largesums. Mr. Hill gave to the erection of the Florence 
High-school Building, Cosmian Hall, and to establish the kindergarten’ school, 
$178,000, and Mr. Lilly gave to Cosmian Hall, the kindergarten, and Smith Col- 
lege, $138,000. 
A beautiful academy of music, thoroughly equipped, was built by E. H. RB, 
Lyman, at a cost of about $100,000, and presented to the city as a token of hig 
loyalty to the place of his nativity. Mr, Lyman has also been a generous friend 
of the college and other institutions of the town. 
Deacon J. P. Williston was a liberal giver to the town. He gave $8,000 toward 
the erection of the old high-shool building, $3,000 toward the erection of a chapel] 
for the First Church, $6,000 for the Center Street schoolhouse, and generous sums 
to the Florence Church and the chapels at Hospital Hill, Bay State, and Leeds. 
Deacon George W. Hubbard gave nearly the whole of his estate of about $90,00 
to Smith College, the Dickinson Hospital, and the Old Ladies’ Home, besides mak+ 
ing generous donations while living. 
Among others who have been generous givers to public uses here may be men4 
tioned, Mrs. Tenny, to Smith College, $10,000; E. A. Brooks, to the Edwards Church, 
$2,000; Ansel Wright, to the Unitarian Church, $3,000, and Edward C. Bodman, ti 
to the Edwards Church, $7,000.   SMITH COLLEGE 
Miss Sophia Smith, of Hatfield, left the greater portion of her estate, one of th 
largest ever accumulated in this section, to found the college in this city whic 
bears her name. The estate at her decease in 1870 amounted to $475,000. Thi 
amount received by the college was $386,608, to which was added the $25,000 pai 
by the town as a condition of the bequest. Since its opening the college hi 
received many gifts, among which are those made by Winthrop Hillyer, a North: 
ampton merchant, of about $100,000, and Alfred T. Lilly, a manufacturer at Flor- 
ence, who bore the entire expense of erecting Lilly Hall. Mr. Hillyer built th 
art gallery which bears his name. Deacon George W. Hubbard gave to the col. 
lege the bulk of his estate, amounting to about $80,000. 
The college was opened for pupils in 1874. There were 13 young women in th 
first class. To-day there are 930 names on the roll of students, and the colleg 
ranks as the leading college for the higher education of women in the world, 
having a larger number of students than any other institution of its class. 
You may well ask, What has brought about this wonderful growth? A numbe: 
of causes have contributed. The popularity of the plan of colleges for women hi 
done much. The cottage system of accommodating the students has been an aid. 
The able corps of college professors and assistants, both male and female, havi 
been a power in the upbuilding. A sound local public sentiment in its behalf ha: 
been of value. But greater than any one, and perhaps greater than all, has bee! 
the admirable management of President Seelye. For its development he ha: 
labored unceasingly, with truly heroic zeal and splendid ability. He has himsel: 
been a constant inspiration to the students, and he may well look upon the resuli 
of his quarter century’s work here with pleasure and satisfaction. 
That the college has been of great benefit to this community we have but to lool 
at the large increase in the value of the real estate in its vicinity, The marke 
 
-P-A-G-E-469

value of real estate in that section has doubled, and in some instances trebled. 
And what it has been to all, to tradesmen, liverymen, mechanics, and others, may 
be seen from the authoritative estimate that of about 850 of the students each 
spends here yearly for all purposes, including tuition, board, and various expenses, 
not less than $500, making an annual revenue to the institution and the people of 
the town from this source alone of the sum of $425,000. 
In view of these facts, is it worth while for the citizens of this city to spend much 
time in considering the question of taxing college property? 2 
What the college has been to this community in a financial point of view it has. 
equaled in a social and literary way. Its presence has been an uplifting force and 
a power for good which this people truly appreciate and for which they are pro- 
foundly grateful.     
        
                           
                         
   
    
     THE SMITH CHARITIES, 
One of the most remarkable wills ever executed in this country is that of Oliver 
Smith. The mind that conceived it was a rare product of this century. The 
charities it founded have proved of great practical value in helping the worthy 
poor and stimulating habits of industry in the boys and girls bound out under its 
provisions. 
Oliver Smith died December 22, 1845, leaving an estate of $370,000. This he gave 
to the towns of Northampton, Amherst, Hadley, Hatfield, Williamsburg, Green- 
field, Deerfield, and Whatley for certain charitable objects, prominent among 
which are gifts to poor widows; loans of $500 each to poor boys after an appren- 
ticeship of three years to some mechanic or farmer, the loans to become gifts after 
five years of good behavior; marriage gifts of $300 to poor girls who shall have 
served an apprenticeship as domestics in families of farmers or mechanics; mar- 
riage gifts of $50 each to indigent young women; and for an agricultural school. 
This fund has increased from year to year until it now amounts to nearly 
$1,300,000, but the amounts available for charity are now more fully paid out 
yearly than during the first twenty-five years after the testator’s decease. 
To show the extent of these charities, there had been paid out since the will was 
probated to May 1, 1896, these sums:

otal yess oa eee Bet ee eg 
The payments considerably exceed the present principal of the funds. 
It is probable that no system of charities was ever more wisely devised than this 
of Oliver Smith. The gifts to widows and indigent young women have been of 
great assistance to them, while the gifts to apprenticed boys and girls have served 
to inculcate in them habits of industry and good behavior. There has been no 
unseemly strife in the management of the institution, and the people of the towns 
interested have shown a commendable interest in administering the great trust in 
ja spirit of loyalty to the evident benevolent intent of the testator. 
Asthe time when the agricultural school provided for by the will isapproaching, 
being only eight years distant, it may be of interest and profit tosee just what this 
school is to be. The fund originally set aside for this school was $30,000. To this 
was added $10,000, which was given to the American Colonization Society on a 
condition which was forfeited. This fund was to accumulate for sixty years from 
the death of the testator, and then be used by the town of Northampton for the 
establishment of the Smith Agricultural School. The fund now amounts to about 
$217,000, and at the expiration of the sixty years—on December 22, 1905—it is 
estimated that it will exceed $300,000. 
Two farms, or lands sufficient for two farms, are to be purchased for the school; 
lone for a ‘‘ pattern farm, to be so improved in practical details as to become a 
Imodel,”* and the other for an ‘‘experimental farm, to aid and assist the labors and 
improvements of the pattern farm in the art and science of husbandry and agri- 
ulture.” So much of the fund as may be necessary to purchase these farms and 
rect suitable buildings thereon is to be paid to the town, and thereafter only the 
income of the remainder can be paid for the maintenance of the school. 
Connected with this school there will bea ‘“‘school of industry, for the benefit of 
ithe poor.” Poor boys are to be admitted and educated, and when 21 years of age

   shall be paid $200 each as a loan ‘‘to enable them to commence business for them- 
selves,” and at the end of five years of good behavior such loans shall become gifts. 
The management of this school shall be by ‘three discreet freeholders, one of 
whom shall be a practical husbandman and one a mechanic,” who “shall annually 
be chosen by ballot in legal town meeting.”

Wuat 1s Higher EpucaTion? 
CHARLES De GARMO, Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania. 
Higher education has not seldom been thought to mean the acquisition of es. 
thetic graces through classical learning. It may more properly be defined as th 
comparative study of all subjects. The graces are only a by-product; classical 
language is but one of many means. Higher education not only refines, it pro 
duces in the man a new order of thinking, a more efficient power of doing. Ele 
mentary education seizes facts; higher education seizes their meaning. Throug! 
the comparative study of all subjects it enables us to perceive relations that Ii 
beneath the surface. It enables us to use the tools of knowledge given by el 
mentary education and to pass beyond the seeming to the real. The senses tell u: 
that the sun goes round the earth, but the educated reason knows better. A glas: 
of water may seem pure, but contain the germs of typhoid fever; a financial polic:

   ish philanthropy may appear to relieve misery, yet in the end augment it. 
The comparative study of knowledge has another peculiarity, in that each sub- 
ject is a focus for large bodies of related facts. In the higher education botany 
is the subject of both organic and inorganic nature from the standpoint of the 
plant. It includes the related facts of physics, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, 
meteorology, physical geography, entomology (the fertilization of plants through 
the agency of insects), and other subjects. Each one of these branches becomes 
in its turn the focus for many of the same facts. It is the standpoint of observa- 
tion that changes, not so much the facts to be observed. This is the reason why 
it is not so necessary in higher education to study a multitude of subjects. When 
the human sciences are taken up, we find that the same thing is true. History 
records the ideas and progress of men largely from the standpoint of political 
action; the history of art records the civilization of the various periods from the 
standpoint of esthetics; that of education treats of the same set of facts, but the 
focus changes to the consideration of the development of the young. The same 
is true of the history of religion, of economics, of language. 
Life itself, both natural and institutional, is a unity of interesting forces. 
Everything is interwoven with everything else. Finance depends upon economics, 
economics upon science, science upon mathematics, government upon all of these 
plus the political genius of the people; the political genius of the people depends 
largely upon its language, its literature, and its history. All of these have had an 
evolution, a development through which alone they can be fully comprehended. 
No man can indeed master all knowledge, so marvelous are its riches; but every 
n, according to his capacity and opportunity, master enough to make his 
g reliable. The college is open tohim. Every great city in the land has 
its university, every library contains the possibility of higher training for those 
who will study. Higher education, like the Christian religion, is a fountain at 
which all who will may drink.    
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
Gen. FRANCIS MARION ON PopuLaR EpucaTIon. 
Dr. Lewis R. Haruny, Central High School, Philadelphia. 
The student of American history remembers Gen. Francis Marion as the dash- 
ing partisan leader of the Revolution, but the ‘‘ Life of Gen. Francis Marion,” by 
Brig. Gen. P. Horry, of Marion’s Brigade, portrays another interesting side of his 
character. General Horryrelatesthatin his last visit to Marion, in 1795, the partisan 
leader, inalengthy conversation, discussed the value of free schools to the Republic. 
Marion claimed that the general ignorance that prevailed throughout the South 
divided that section, rendering it an easy prey to the British, who held it in their 
possession during the greater part of the Revolutionary struggle. The remarks of 
Marion read with all the freshness of a treatise on popular education composed in 
the last quarter of the nineteenth century, and they are worthy of reproduction 
here. General Horry remarked to Marion that he feared the legislature of Caro- 
lina would dread the expense of free schools, when Marion replied as follows: 
“What, sir! Keep a nation in ignorance rather than vote a little of their own 
money for education! Only let such politicians remember what poor Carolina has 
already lost through her ignorance. What was it that brought the British, last 
war, to Carolina but her lack of knowledge? Had the people been enlightened, 
they would have been united; and had they been united, they never would have 
been attacked a second time by the British. For after that drubbing they got 
from us at Fort Moultrie, in 1776, they would as soon have attacked the devil as 
have attacked Carolina again, had they not heard that we were ‘a house divided 
against itself;’ or in other words, had amongst us a great number of Tories; men 
who, through mere ignorance, were disaffected to the cause of liberty, and ready 
to join the British against theirown countrymen. Thus, ignorance begat toryism, 
and toryism begat losses in Carolina of which few have any idea. 
‘‘According to the last accounts, America spent in the last war $70,000,000, 
which, divided among the States according to population, gives to Carolina about 
'$8,000,000; making, as the war lasted eight years, $1,000,000 a year. Now, itis 
generally believed, the British after their loss of Burgoyne and their fine Northern 
army, would soon have given up the contest, had it not been for the foothold they

-P-A-G-E-472
    1430 — EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
got in Carolina, which protracted the war at least two years longer. And as this 
two years’ ruinous war in Carolina was owing to the encouragement the enemy 
got there, and that encouragement to toryism, and that toryism to ignorance, 
ignorance may fairly be debited to two millions of loss to Carolina. 
«Well, in these two extra years of tory-begotten war, Carolina lost at least 4,000 
men; and among them a Laurens, a Williams, a Campbell, a Haynes, and many 
others, whose worth not the gold of Ophir could value. But rated at the price at 
which the Prince of Hesse sold his people to George the Third to shoot Americans, 
say £30 sterling a head, or $165, they make $600,000. Then count the 25,000 slaves 
which Carolina certainly lost, and each slave at the moderate price of $300, and 
you have $7,500,000. To this add the houses, barns, and stables that were burned; 
the plate plundered; the furniture lost; the hogs, sheep, and horned cattle killed; 
the rice, corn, and other crops destroyed, and they amount, at the most moderate 
calculation, to five millions. 
‘But if it be melancholy to think of so many elegant houses, rich furniture, fat 
cattle, and precious crops destroyed for want of that patriotism which a true knowl- 
edge of our interests would have inspired; then how much more melancholy to 
think of those torrents of precious blood that were shed, those cruel slaughters 
and massacres that took place among the citizens, from the same cause! As proof 
that such hellish tragedies would never have been acted had our Staté been enlight- 
ened, only let us look at the people of New England. From Britain, their fathers 
had fled to America for religion’s sake. Religion taught them that God created 
men to be happy; that to be happy they must have virtue; that virtue is not to be 
attained without knowledge, nor knowledge without instruction, nor public instruc- 
tion without free schools, nor free schools without legislative order. 
“Among a people who fear God, the knowledge of duty is the same as doing it. 
Believing it to be the first command of God, ‘let there be light,’ and believing it 
to be the will of God that all should be instructed, from the least to the greatest, 
these wise legislators at once set about publicinstruction. They did not ask, How 
will my constituents like this?) Won’t they turn me out? Shall I not lose my $3 
per day? No, but fully persuaded that public instruction is God’s will, because 
the people’s good, they set about it like the true friends of the people. 
“‘Now, mark the happy consequence. When the war broke out, you heard of, 
no division in New England; no toryism, nor any of its horrid effects; no houses 
in flames, kindled by the hands of fellow-citizens; no neighbors waylaying and 
shooting their neighbors, plundering their property, carrying off their stock, and 
aiding the British in the cursed work of American murder and subjugation. But, 
on the contrary, with minds well informed of their rights and hearts glowing with 
love for themselves and posterity, they rose up against the enemy, firm and united, 
as a band of shepherds against the ravening: wolves. 
«And their valor in the field gave glorious proof how men will fight when they 
know that their all is at stake. See Major Pitcairn, on the memorable 19th of 
April, 1775, marching from Boston, with 1,000 British regulars, to burn the Ameri- 
can stores at Concord. Though hisheroic excursion was commenced under cover 
of the night the farmers soon took the alarm, and gathering around them with 
their fowling pieces, presently knocked down one-fourth of their number and 
caused the rest to run, as if, like the swinein the gospel, they had alegion of devils 
at their backs. 
“Now, with sorrowful eyes, let us turn to our own State, where no pains were 
ever taken to enlighten the minds of the poor. There we have seen a people natu- 
rally as brave as the New Englanders, for mere lack of knowledge of the blessings} 
they possessed, of the dangers threatened, suffer Lord Cornwallis, with only 1,600) 
men, to chase General Greene upward of 800 miles, in fact, to scout him through| 
the two great States of South and North Carolina, as far as Guilford Court House, 
and when Greene, joined at that place by 2,000 poor, illiterate militiamen, deter-| 
mined at length to fight, what did he gain by them, with all their number, but 
disappointment and disgrace? For, though posted very advantageously behind the| 
cornfield fences, they could not stand a single fire from the British, but, in spite| 
of their officers, broke and fled like baseborn slaves, leaving their loaded muskets 
sticking in the fence corners. 
“But, from this shameful sight, turn again to the land of free schools—to Bunker’s| 
Hill. There, behind a poor ditch of half a night’s raising, you behold 1,500 militia- 
men waiting the approach of 3,000 British regulars with a heavy train of artillery. 
With such odds against them—such fearful odds in numbers, discipline, arms,| 
and martial fame—will they not shrink from the contest, and, like their Southern 
friends, jump up and run? Oh, no; toa man they have been taught to read; to 
aman they have been instructed to know, and, dearer than life to prize, the bless- 
ings of freedom. Their bodies are lying behind ditches, but their thoughts are on
-P-A-G-E-473

the wing, darting through eternity. The warning voice of God still rings in their 
ears, The hated forms of proud, merciless kings pass before their eyes. They 
look back to the days of old, and strengthen themselves as they think what their 
gallant forefathers dared for liberty and for them. They look forward to their 
own dear children, and yearn over the unoffending millions, now, with tearful 
eyes, looking up to them for protection. And shall this infinite host of deathless 
beings, created in God’s own image, and capable by virtue and equal laws of 
endless progression in glory and happiness—shall they be arrested-in their high 
career, and from the free-born sons of God be degraded into the slaves of men? 
Maddening at the accursed thought, they grasp their avenging firelocks, and, draw- 
ing their sights along the death-charged tubes, they long for the coming up of the 
British thousands. Three times the British thousands came up; and three times 
the dauntless yeomen, waiting their near approach, received them in storms of 
thunder and lightning that shivered their ranks and heaped the fields with their 
weltering carcasses. 
“Tn short, my dear sir, men will always fight for their Government, according 
to their sense of its value. To value it aright, they must understand it. This they 
ican not do without education. And asa large portion of our citizens are poor, 
land can never attain that inestimable blessing without the aid of government, it 
lis plainly the first duty of government to bestow it freely upon them. And the 
more perfect the government, the greater the duty to make it well known. Selfish 
land oppressive governments, indeed, as Christ observes, must ‘hate the light, and 
fear to come to it, because their deeds areevil.’ Buta government like our Repub- 
lic ‘longeth for the light, and rejoiceth to come to the light, that its works may 
ibe made manifest that they are wrought in God,’ and well worth all the vigilance 
land valor that an enlightened nation can rally for its defense. And, God knows, 
good government can hardly ever be half anxious enough to give its citizens a 
horough knowledge of its own excellencies. For, as some of the most valuable 
truths have been lost for lack of promulgation, so the best government on earth, 
if not duly known and prized, may be subverted. Ambitious demagogues will rise, 
nd the people, through ignorance and love of change, will follow them. Vast 
mies will be formed and bloody battles fought. And after desolating their coun- 
ry with allthe horrors of civil war the guilty survivors will have to bend their 
ecks to the iron yoke of some stern usurper, and like beasts of burden to drag, 
pitied, those galling chains which they have riveted upon themselves for ages.” 
            
    
          
    
    
      
       
     
     
   
    
    
   
   
   
     VIRGINIA. 
MANASSAS INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, MANAssas, VA. 
By H. P. Monraomery, Supervising Principal in the Colored Schools of Washington, D. C. 
This school is the direct outgrowth of an effort on the part of Miss Jennie Dean, 
young woman of remarkable energy and religious fervor, to better the condition 
f her own race living among the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in a sec- 
ion of the State of Virginia where the devastation from the late war was great, 
nd from which the people have not yet fully rallied. 
Miss Jane E. Thompson, a teacher in the public schools of Washington, D. C., 
hile on a visit to her grandparents, who lived in that region, was attracted by 
he work of Miss Dean. Miss Thompson, although a descendant of slaveholding 
ncestors, was so impressed with the character and importance of Miss Dean’s 
ork that she determined on returning to interest her city friends init. She 
mally succeeded in bringing the matter to the attention of the late Gen. R. D. 
ussey, Gen. John Eaton, ex-United States Commissioner of Education; Mr. 
enry E. Baker, Mr. H. P. Montgomery, and Mr. J. H. Meriwether, all of Wash- 
ington, D. C., and Hon. George C. Round, Rey, M. D. Williams, and others, of 
anassas, Va. 
By the advice and assistance of these gentlemen a farm containing 100 acres 
as purchased. This farm was a part of the Bull Run battlefield, located about 
mile south of the town of Manassas, on the Southern Railroad. 
The necessity for such a school is shown by the following statistics: 
The last census shows in Prince William County (in which the school is located) 
nd the adjoining counties of Fauquier, Stafford, Loudoun and Fairfax, a total col- 
red population of 23,972, with a school population of 11,200, while statistics of 
he United States Bureau of Education show the average percentage of daily 
ttendance in the colored schools to be 24.5. 
This condition of affairs was brought to the attention of the colored people, and

they were urged to take a more active interest in the education and elevation of 
their children by helping to build a school where they might be taught the indus- 
tries and trades, thus enabling them to command better wages, secure more desir- 
able homes, and become better men and better citizens. 
Their response was not large contributions of money, for of that they had little 
or none, but they came forward with generous donations of labor and farm prod- 
ucts, which greatly assisted the directors in the erection of their tirst building. 
The desire for a school and the determination to have one became so strong that 
Miss Thompson, at her own expense, went to Boston, where she was greatly encour- 
aged by Dr. Edward Everett Hale, Mrs. M. C. Whitman, and Col. L. Edwin Dudley. 
Through the kindness of these persons Miss Dean was invited to Boston to represent 
the cause of the school in meetings which they had arranged for her. Thecontribu- 
tions from these meetings, together with a generous sum from Miss Howland, our 
largest contributor, enabled us to erect a suitable house in which to open the school 
during the following autumn. A neat frame building, 40 by 38 feet, was erected 
(wholly by colored mechanics) during the spring and summer. 
Some difficulty was experienced in getting teachers for the school, as the direct- 
ors were entirely without money with which to pay salaries. Dr. E, P. Clemens, 
Miss M. E. Vernon, and Mr. J. Thomas were finally induced to enter upon the 
work without the guaranty of any salary. 
So great was the desire of the people to place their children in school that boys 
and girls reported before the building had been completed. It would never do to 
send them home again, so the school was organized in the kitchen of a little farm- 
house on the place, where its work was carried on until the completion of the new 
building, Howland Hall. The growth of the school was so rapid that it was soon 
taxed beyond its accommodations, and many were turned away. 
The school is strictly industrial, its aim being— 
(1) To train its students to habits of usefulness and purity of character by stim- 
ulating and developing all their powers—-mental, moral, and physical. 
(2) To teach the dignity and importance of labor, and how to perform it skill- 
fully and with profit. | 
(3) To teach the value and use of money, and how to use it in getting homes. 
(ay to train young men and women for useful, intelligent, and patriotic citi. 
zenship. 
These ideas were emphasized in all the work of the school, and the effect upo: 
the community was soon manifested by the almost daily visits and expressions o! 
approval by those who had looked upon the establishment of the school with sus: 
picion. But just at this time, during the coldest weather ever known in Virginia 
and when the school seemed to be doing the greatest good by attracting wid 
and favorable attention, Howland Hall, for which we had labored so long an 
Rabon tly: and the only building we had for school purposes and dormitories, wi 
lestroyed by a fire due to a defective flue. The students were left shelterless an 
without even a change of clothing, for the fire came so suddenly and burned s 
furiously that nearly everything was destroyed. 
The people of Manassas came to our relief by taking our girls into their familie: 
and boarding them for the nominal sum of $4 a month. Without losing eithe: 
courage or time the teachers and pupils set about making arrangements for con- 
tinuing their work in a nearby church without the loss of a single school day. 
Before the opening of the next school year another building, larger, more sub- 
stantial, and better in all its appointments, was erected and made ready for use. 
On October 1, 1895, the building was dedicated, and the exercises mark an epoc! 
in the history of both races as they dwell together in the State of Virginia. Ther 
the foremost citizens of Virginia’s white population stand side by side with th 
earnest, hopeful ones of her colored population, each and all of them aiding th 
cause of education among the recently emancipated. The good influence of th 
school upon the community is distinctly marked. Mayor Taylor, of Manassas, i 
speaking of the school, said that it had done more ‘to elevate the conduct an 
aspirations of the colored people than all other agencies combined. For the first 
time since emancipation not a single person of color was arrested during the last 
Christmas holidays. Not a single case of disorderly conduct or drunkenness wa: 
reported or noticed.” 
The people of both races take great interest in the school and do all they can t 
romote its welfare. The colored people take especial pride in the school. The 
ave contributed generously of their limited means for its support, and therefor 
feel that it is largely a thing of their own creation. No school in the country i 
doing a better work than this, and those interested in the development of the col 
ored people are invited to visit the school and examine its work, remembering tha 
it is purely an industrial school.

  EDUCATION IN VARIOUS STATES. 1433 
During the past year 92 pupils were given instruction in the following indus- 
tries: Sewing, 73;! cooking, 73;! laundry work, 48; carpentry, 50. 
- Some girls took instruction in carpentry, and by their aptness demonstrated the 
ability of girls to learn the use of tools. The thoroughly practical and economical 
value of the instruction given the classes above is shown in the fact that all the 
meals during the entire year for both teachers and pupils were prepared at an 
average cost of less than 20 cents a day for each person. 
The school is a corporation, regularly chartered under the laws of Virginia. It 
is under the general management of a board of directors, whose names are as 
follows: Hon. Carroll D. Wright, president, Prof. H. P. Montgomery, vice-presi- 
dent; Mr. Henry E. Baker, treasurer; Rev. J. H. Bradford, recording secretary; 
Rev. H. H. Waring, corresponding secretary; Mrs. George F. Hoar, Mrs. M. C. 
Whitman, Miss Emily Howland, Mrs. M. H. Doolittle, Mrs. H. P. Montgomery, 
Mrs. Orra Langhorne, Rev. M. D. Williams, Rev. D. J. Henderson, Miss Jennie 
Dean, Dr. J. M. Clarkson, Hon. George C. Round, Capt. Robert Tyler, Mr. J. H. 
Meriwether, Dr. W. S. Montgomery, Mr. L. C. Bailey, Rev. W. A. Oreditt, Mrs. 
Dodge, Mr. James Dorum. 
Although the school is nonsectarian in character, it is pervaded by Christian 
influence. 
The chartered life of this school began about three yearsago. During this time 
$12,486.02 have been contributed from various sources. With this money a farm, 
containing nearly 100 acres, has been bought, four buildings erected, two halls, a 
barn, and a structure used for a carpenter shop, shoe shop, and laundry. The 
school is without endowment or State aid. It derives its support from charitable 
contributions.   
  
1 Twenty-six of these were boys.

CHAPTER XXXIV. 
REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BurEAU OF EpucaTiIon, ALASKA DIVISION, 
Washington, D. C., June 30, 1896. 
Str: I have the honor to submit the eleventh annual report of the United States 
neral agent of education in Alaska for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896. 
There is in Alaska a school population of from 8,000 to 10,000; of these 1,197 
re enrolled in the 22 Government schools. 
Cape Prince Wales.—Thomas Hanna, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 104; popu- 
ion, Eskimo. The past year having been a very severe one, with much scarcity 
food at times, many of the children were compelled to be absent fishing for 
eir daily meals. This irregular attendance added greatly to the burdens of the 
lacher. He reported during the winter much trouble was had through drunken 
len and women coming to the schoolroom and making a disturbance. Seven 
es windows were broken by them and knives drawn. While but little intoxi- 
ting liquor is traded or received from the ships, a very large quantity is made 
the village itself during the winter, especially as it is known that the revenue 
tter is gone and will be absent for months. It is reported that the natives of 
e village distill liquor not only for their own use, but for trading all up and 
wn the coast. He also reports that much gambling is carried on in the village, 
which everything available belonging to house or person is freely sacrificed. 
deed, there are many things in that section that require that some court of 
stice or some power should be established that can enforce the laws and protect 
e interests of the community. 
St. Lawrence Island.—V.C. Gambell, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 68; popu- 
ion, Eskimo. The attendance and interest manifested during the second year of 
e school was better than the first, for during the present year quite a number of 
rls attended, although they are reported as still very bashful in their school duties. 
he pupils that have attended school with any degree of regularity have made 
od progress in their studies and greatly improved in their personal appearance. 
ey read well, write legibly, and are quick at number work. One boy had kept 
list of all the words that had been given him, and when he understood the 
rangement of the dictionary, made an alphabetical list of them ina blank book 
athad been givenhim. This he did without any suggestions fromanyone. Quite 
emulation was excited among them to keep themselves and their clothes clean, 
d alsoavoid those among their companions whom they suspected of being infested. 
ith vermin. They sometimes informed the teacher that such and such ones had 
ty hands or faces. In the spring a number of families visited the village from 
Iberia, and the difference between the pupils that have been in school and those 
iom the Asiatic side is very apparent. In addition to the 68 regwar pupils there 
lere some 20 others that attended irregularly and have not been counted. 
Teller Reindeer Station.—T. L. Brevig, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 56; popu- 
ion, Eskimo. The school attendance during the year has increased in regularity 
er the preceding year, and with increased regularity of attendance the children 
lem to take more interest in their studies. The convenience and comfort of the 
w school building has probably also had something to do with,the attendance. 
Auroras were observed October 16, 1895, November 17, 18, and 19, December 19, 
|, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 830, and on every clear night during January, Febru- 
y, and March, 1896. During April there was a notable decrease in the number 
the auroras, and in May but two, occurring on the 2d and 4th of the month. 
Unalaska.—John A. Tuck, principal, and Miss M. Elizabeth Mellor, assistant 
cher; enrollment of pupils, 39; population, Aleut. The school year has been

  1436 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
an uneventful one, the work having run on from day to day in each room mark 
by a quiet, steady progress. As in previous years, the school has been cramp 
for want of accommodations, nearly all the available space being occupied by t 
girls connected with the Methodist Woman’s Missionary Home. Only five bo 
were in attendance. Probably double the attendance would have been had h: 
there been room for the pupils. The very first requirement for successful teac! 
ing among such a people is patient reiteration. Like most undeveloped rac 
they have little aptitude for mathematics. In order to develop this branch 
study in their minds, the teacher made a regular and constant interchange betwe 
the mental and written, or slate work. In fractions, for instance, taking up t 
entire subject as developed in a good mental arithmetic, alternating daily betwe 
oral and written analysis and reviewing as often as might be necessary. Then 
would take up the same subject from a common-school arithmetic, using t 
slate and working with larger numbers. A constant change of method seems 
have worked well in relieving the strain upon their undeveloped powers of atte: 
tion. Penmanship and map-drawing studies, which draw on the imaginati 
faculties, are acquired with ease. The spelling lesson was made an aid to rea| 
~ ing, the words given being taken from the reading lesson and studied; then writt 
on the slate from dictation before the reading lesson began. In this way t 
words were first learned; then their use in connection with other words w: 
shown in the reading lesson. The children have shown a great fondness f 
language and observation lessons. In the crowded condition of the schoolroo: 
Miss Mellor’s recitations were compelled to be heard in the dining room of t 
mission, where the proper ventilation has been very difficult to secure. Lal 
year the Government contracted for the erection of a large, comfortable scho} 
building, with teacher’s residence attached, and also dormitories for the boys. 
few days after the workmen had left the building as completed, a storm blew 
off the foundation. An examination being instituted, it was found that the er 
tion of the building had been slighted in so many directions that it was unsafe 
occupy it. As I was sent last spring to make a special investigation of the con: 
tion of the building by the Secretary of the Interior, mention will be more ful 
made of this building later on in thereport. This year completes the seventh ye: 
of service by Mr. Tuck: Too much praise can not be given him for his patience a: 
self-denial and long continuance in the service in the face of great opposition ai 
difficulties in maintaining the school. Nor is it too much tosay that the unstint 
praise which has been given of the progress of the pupils in that school is due 
his superior skill as a teacher. The progress of the pupils under him has been 
marked that Government officials in their public reports, desiring to secure bett 
educational facilities for this or that community, have mentioned Mr. Tuc 
school at Unalaska as the type desired. For a portion of thattime the school w; 
known as a contract school. The Woman’s Home Missionary Society of tl 
Methodist Church, and the ladies of that association, the Government, and 
friends of humanity owe Mr. and Mrs. Tuck a large debt of gratitude for whj 
they have accomplished, In view of these things it was not strange that some 
the native Aleut population came to the wharf to bid Mr. and Mrs. Tuck go 
speed as they left Unalaska for their eastern home. 
Unga.—O. R. McKinney, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 44; population, Ale 
The school year opened on the 16th of September, 1895, with 29 pupils in atten| 
ance. This number increased to 34 at the end of the month. The close of Oc! 
ber saw 35 in attendance. At that time an epidemic similar to la grippe broke o 
in the village, which reduced the school attendance to 30 for the month of Nove: 
ber and 29 for that of December. In January the attendance resumed the nor: 
number. Washington’s birthday was celebrated by a school exhibition, whi 
awakened much interest among the parents of the pupils. During the past sui 
mer an addition 12 by 20 feet was built to the schoolhouse for the use of the c: 
culating library which has been established by the teacher. This is one of tl 
model schools of the Territory. ‘ 
Afognak.—Mrs. C. M. Colwell, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 39; populatio} 
Aleut. The general tone and condition of the pupils has shown a marked impro 
ment since the establishment of the school. They are well-behaved, and bei 
naturally intelligent compare quite favorably with the children of other comm 
nities. There is much poverty among the families, so that many of the childr 
are very poorly clad. However, the improvement among the children is in a me: 
ure elevating their older brothers and sisters and their parents, so that a noticea 
improvement can be seen in the homes of the people. This causes hope that ti 
next generation of natives in Alaska will show a very gratifying improveme: 
mentally and morally over their predecessors. 
Kadiak.—C. C. Solter, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 49; population, Ale
-P-A-G-E-479
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1437 
The teacher reports a very gratifying progress in reading and drawing, in which 
the pupils excel. In the other branches of study their progress was normal. It 
‘is very difficult getting the pupils to use out of the school the instructions given 
them in English, as all the conversation at home is in their native tongue. ‘There 
‘is also a prejudice on the part of the parents against the children learning Eng- 
lish lest they would be weaned away from the Russian Church. There has also 
ibeen the hostility of the priest of the Greek Church, more or less disguised, 
lagainst the school. Upon different occasions he forbade all the children to attend 
school, but a number seemed to have disregarded his command and attended. 
[Another drawback to the school work is the one that is common inall those local- 
ities where the Greek Church has a foothold. Thereare 12 holidaysin the church 
which are to them peculiarly holy, and during which the children are required 
ito leave school and attend church. Then, in addition to these 12, are 200 holidays, 
nore or less, when absence from school is sought to be excused by attendance 
pon church service. This, of course, breaks up all regularity of attendance and 
11 connected instruction, so that the pupils in the districts controlled by the Rus- 
ian Greek Church have made less progress than those at other places. On Christ- 
as eve an entertainment was given bythe school to the community, which 
licited many tokens of approval from the parents. 
Karluk.—R. B. Dunmire, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 27; population, Aleut. 
‘his population are still uncivilized and decidedly opposed to anything American. 
‘heir experience has largely been with the lower American element-that often- 
imes clusters around salmon canneries. This lower element of our American civ- 
filization has treated the natives brutally, and they have no reason to admire the 
merican ways. These natives are very poor, and especially during the past win- 
er suffered from the want of both food and clothing. Some of the children came 
0 school through the snow entirely barefooted. The children seemed to be bright, 
nd learn quite readily. During the year there has been an increased regularity 
f attendance, and I have noticed less opposition on the part of the parents. So 
far, the attendance is largely by boys, the girls being very bashful and their 
arents afraid to have them out of their sight. 
Haines.—W.W. Warne, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 60; population, Thlinget. 
‘he year was one of the most prosperous in the history of the school. From Sep- 
ember to January 19 the school was open to all who desired to attend, and the 
ttendance was so large that our room was too small and the teacher had more 
upils and classes than could be accommodated. Then came the fire which 
flestroyed the schoolhouse, and there was no room in the village large enough to 
continue the school for the whole population. Not only the building, but the seats 
nd books were burned, so that the difficulty of continuing the school was made 
uch greater. Inasmall room a portion of the pupils was given blackboard 
xercises in the forenoon and another portion in the afternoon. This continued 
‘or several weeks, until a supply of second-hand books was sent from Juneau, 
nd then the school was continued all day. This present season a new and larger 
uilding will be erected, and the teacher looks forward to the coming year with 
‘eat pleasure. 
Hoonah.—Mary E. Howell, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 144; population, 
‘hlinget. The school, which opened with but few pupils in the fall, became so 
large in the winter that it was difficult to manage. The irregularity in the lives 
f the natives makes it very difficult to secure regular attendance on the part of 
he pupils. As a rule the natives do not have an early morning meal; conse- 
uently many of the children come to school without their breakfast, which makes 
em very restless before noon. This out-of-the-way community has had much to 
ontend with by several deaths during the year by witchcraft. At this, as at so 
any of the other schools, year by year the teachers claim that the great improve- 
ent to the school system to be sought after would be obligatory attendance. 
Juneau School, No. 1.—S. A. Keller, teacher; attendance of pupils, 70; popula- 
ion, whites. Of the 26 pupils enrolled the first day, 9 attended until the close of 
he term and 2 were present every day, and this although in the short days it 
as still dark at 9 o’clock, and some days with a cold wind sweeping down from 
he mountains, with the thermometer registering 16° below zero. Those that 
ave proper home influences are just the same as bright, healthy American chil- 
ren anywhere; but we have a number in our community who are permitted to 
‘oam the streets and thereby fall into irregular and vicious habits. Our popula- 
ion being a nomadic one, families come and go, making much irregularity and 
‘requent changes in the attendance of the children. The school greatly needs 
larger accommodations. The crowding resorted to during the year interfered 
ery much with the efficiency of discipline and the progress of the pupils. The 
chool has also arrived at that stage when a second teacher is essential. It should

be graded into primary and grammar departments with a competent teacher over 
each. Mrs. J. W. Bixby has taught a kindergarten during the year at the expense 
of the parents of the pupils. Considerable improvement has been made in remoy- 
ing the stumps from and grading the school grounds. This work should be con- 
tinued until the property is placed in good shape. The ground should also be 
drained, so that it would become sufficiently dry for the playing of the children. 
Citizens of the place have manifested more than ordinary interest in the progress 
of the school. 
Juneau School, No. 2.—Elizabeth: Saxman, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 67; 
population, Thlinget. At the close of her third year, Miss Saxman reports her 
pupils have taken increasing interest in their work, and their progress has been 
correspondingly marked. Nearly all of them were pupils that had been in the 
school before and made it much pleasanter for the teacher, and manifested the 
same gratifying results. Asnearly all of her pupils have a home in the Presby- 
terian mission, the average attendance has very nearly equaled the enrollment. 
She mentions a little girl who, at the beginning of the term, knew no English 
whatever; at the expiration of three months she was able to read, spell, and count 
well. Her progress, however, in writing was very slow, which seemed the more 
peculiar, as her people excel in that branch of study. Among the older pupils 
was a native girl, married to a white man, who was accustomed to do her house- 
work in the morning and attend school in the afternoon. She was always present 
regardless of the weather and made good progress in her studies. 
Douglas City.—Lathan A. Jones, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 57; population, 
whites. This school seems to have had a more turbulent time during the past 
year than any other. There was considerable friction in the community over the 
location of a new school building, the present school building being in the north 
edge of town (when it was located the village was rapidly growing in that direc- 
tion, and it was the only place where sufficient grounds could: be secured for school 
purposes). The difference of sentiment among the parents¢reated much turbulence 
among the pupils, and although the teacher did his best, yet the results were not as 
satisfactory as in former years. The parents have taken but little interest in the 
school, which has created much irregularity of attendance among the pupils. A 
child that attends school two or three days of the week and then runs the streets 
the other two or three days receives no benefit himself, and is a detriment to the 
other pupils when he attends. A schoolhouse has been erected during the season 
at the south end of the village, where a school will be held this coming year. 
Sitka, No. 1.—Mrs. G. Knapp, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 40; population, 
white—American and Russian. During the year some of the children in the 
higher grades have been in correspondence with children of schools in the States, 
sending samples of Alaska woods, furs, and carvings, and receiving in return) 
specimens of products from the various States. By this means a new interest in 
geography and language lessons has been created, especially beneficial to many of 
the pupils in the school who have never been out of Alaska. Occasional entertain- 
ments have secured the interest of the parents. A small circulating library has 
been maintained, which is greatly appreciated, as most of the children have no 
books in their homes. 
Sitka school No. 2.—Miss Cassia Patton, teacher; enrollment, 156; population, 
Thlinget. This school for the native children is conveniently located near the 
ranch. Throughout the winter months festivals of the Greek Church, feasting 
and dances in honor of visitors from other tribes, and in the spring hunting and 
fishing greatly interfere with regularity of attendance. However, with the aid 
of Governor Sheakley, who frequently caused native policemen to hunt up truants, 
avery creditable attendance was maintained. Miss Patton has introduced kinder- 
garten games and methods into her school, and has succeeded in making it attract- 
ive to her pupils. z 
Fort Wrangel.—Miss Anna R. Kelsey, teacher; enrollment, 82; population, 
Thlinget. Miss Kelsey writes: ‘‘I have just closed my third school year in Fort 
Wrangel. Iam happy to say that the last year has in many respects been the 
encouraging. The attendance has been better with much less effort on my 
part. When the children are going away with their parents hunting or for wood, 
fish, or making gardens, they tell me of it. On their return they come into school 
again, even if it is only for a week or two before another flitting. Thus I know 
pretty nearly their whereabouts and can keep a hold on them. The first year| 
when they were absent from their places I used to have to go through storm andi 
sunshine searching for them. The pupils sometimes express regret that their 
friends oblige them to go away with them and lose school. That in itself is 
encouraging. At the close of February I said to the pupils, ‘How time flies; 
only three more months’ school.’ A chorus of voices responded, ‘Oh, so soon?

    e’re sorry; we rather have school.’ The children certainly did better work and 
owed much greater interest in their studies than formerly. One of the local 
ard when visiting the school expressed both surprise and pleasure at the interest 
mifested by the pupils in all the school exercises. The winter feasting and 
ncing interfered as usual with the attendance and interest. I notice, too, that 
en there are native families here for a short time, they are quite apt now to 
md their children to school during their stay. There has not been anything 
oken or damaged, even to a pane of glass, during the entire year.” 
ISaxman.—J. W. Young, teacher; enrollment, 31; population, Thlinget. Mr. 
ung reports as follows: ‘I arrived here October 28, 195, to take charge of the 
ool work and also the work of gathering together a temperance, self-governing 
immunity, and I may say at the start that my success has been only partial. It 
es a good deal of time to get the natives together and build up a town. When 
rrived there was no building here except the schoolhouse. The natives have 
ce built seven houses. During three months we had about 50 inhabitants, 
ny of them living in tents. That they are anxious to have their children edu- 
ted was shown by their coming here and camping in tents during the bitter cold 
ather of January and February, so that they could send their children to school. 
e children have made very good progress. Many of them had never been in 
hool before. About April 1 the natives began to go hunting, and by April 15 
ie town was deserted. They promised that when they have built themselves 
od houses they will not take the women and children with them when they go 
nting. Iwas very sorry for the children camping in the snow, and that they 
ight be near a school I appealed to Dr. Jackson for funds to build a guest or 
immunity house which they could occupy. He sent me $200, with which I have 
cted a substantial and comfortable house, doing most of the work with my own 
nds, The great hindrance to the work of educating and civilizing these natives 
intoxicating liquor, sold as ‘extract of Jamaica ginger’ by white men. If it 
re not disguised, I could have the vendors arrested, but they evade the law by 
label. It seems to be the ambition of the people to build up a town similar to 
tlakahtla, and I have encouraged them in it. At the same time, I impress on 
m that they must put away their old superstitions, and that they must let liquor 
ne, I have surveyed the town, and will have the houses in regular order. Alto- 
ther, I think the prospect encouraging for a good school and moral community 
from 200 to 300 inhabitants.” 
‘ackson.—Miss C. Baker, teacher; enrollment, 64; population, Thlinget. The 
iet routine of school life at this little out-of-the-way village was sadly broken by 
accidental shooting of one of the older boys. Bert Charles, a high-spirited 
askan boy, and his friend, Willie Johns, the son of Captain Johns, a chief, and 
ers were out in a canoe hunting deer. They sighted an animal on the shore, 
din high glee started for ashotathim. ‘‘ Bert had just loaded his gun,” writes 
teacher, ‘“‘ when he saw that the deer had already been struck. He dropped 
gun totake the paddles, when Willie exclaimed, ‘ Bert, you’ve shot me!’ How 
appened Bert did not know. ‘I know I did it, for the load was out of my gun,’ 
said. Willie died in the boat. The law of retaliation is strong among the 
askans, and according to that law Bert knew that his life would be demanded 
ry that of his friend. Just before he died, Willie asked the others to say to 
people that he did not wish them to punish Bert, as he did not mean to 
ot him. The boys wanted toland Bert where he couldrunaway. He answered, 
o; if I do, they will say that I did it on purpose; I will go back; they can 
what they like to me.’ So he stayed to help carry the body from the canoe 
o his father’s house. I can not describe the wild scene on the beach and 
eet when the canoe landed. In what seemed like a moment, scores of men 
id boys were rushing about with knives and guns, ready for defense or attack. 
e dead boy’s family being a strong one, it was thought they would at once 
nand the life of the poor boy whose shot: had been so fatal. Soon the paci- 
ng influence of the missionary made itself felt. Most of the natives carried 
ir guns home, and the distracted father, standing beside his dead son, said: 
obody is to blame for this; the great God has~done it.’ Some of Willie’s 
lends, however, still called for blood—revenge; and Bert stood all night at the 
lad of the body, with folded arms, not knowing at’ what moment his life would 
taken. Finally his relatives paid, as a ransom for his life, 400 blankets and $80 
money. This he is expected to pay back, or bea slave to his people. He has 
ered a great deal, and will be subject to persecution as long as he remains in 
home. So far they have taken all he has earned, and will continue to do so 
spite of all that can be done for him. Before this happened, he was high caste, 
h spirited, high tempered; now he is a slave, crushed and heartbroken.” Stb- 
uently the means necessary for bringing him to the Carlisle school, Pennsyl-

vania, was furnished by a benevolent friend, where he is now, a patient, Christia 
student. When he was asked what he would do with his education, he said: ‘ 
should like to go back to my people and help them.” As the feeling will probabl 
subside in his absence, he can, no doubt, return to his people, and influence ther 
as no stranger could.

SCHOOLHOUSE, UNALASKA. 
On the 14th of May, 1895, the Secretary of the Interior entered into a contract 
ith Mr. David William Starrett, of Port Townsend, Wash., for the erection of 
one-and-a-half-story school building and teacher’s residence, 90 by 31 feet in 
‘ize, for which he was to receive $2,135.25 upon the completion and acceptance of 
ne-half of the building, and the balance, $2,609.75, upon the completion and 
;cceptance of the whole work, making a total cost of $4,745. Hon, Lycurgus T. 
oodward, United States commissioner at Unalaska, was appointed superin- 
endent of the work. Upon the ist of October, 1895, Mr. Woodward, in behalf of 
ihe Government, accepted the building from the contractor and certified it as 
omplete in every respect and constructed in accordance with the plans and speci- 
cations. Whereupon the contractor sent in his bill for the balance of his pay, 
aving received from the Government $2,135.25 upon the completion and accept- 
nce of the first half of the work. The same mail that brought the bill of the 
ontractor to Washington also brought information that upon the 24th day of 
tober, 1895, said schoolhouse had been blown from its foundation and partly 
tecked. The same mail brought a communication from Mr. John A. Tuck, the 
overnment school-teacher, testifying that the building had not been constructed 
accordance with the plans and specifications. This letter was referred by the

   Commissioner of Education to the Secretary of the Interior for his information 
with a request that the accounts of the contractor be held up for further infor 
mation. 
Under date of November 23, 1895, the Secretary returned the papers to the educ 
tional office, requesting the Commissioner of Education to make a full investigatio: 
with a view to determine whether the building was constructed in accordane 
with the plans and specifications. By your direction I took the opportunity o: 
my visit to Unalaska to make a full investigation, and found that the Governmen 
school building was not constructed in accordance with the plans and specifica 
tions, and was not constructed in a workmanlike manner. It should be said her 
that Commissioner Woodward, who was appointed superintendent of construction 
disclaimed any knowledge of carpentering or house building; more than that 
while the house was in process of erection he was absent from the village an 
gaye the work no special attention. When the carpenters and builders wer 
through, he took their word to the fact of its being built according to specification: 
and gave the contractor a certificate of acceptance, so that his certificate is of n 
value as a statement of fact. As the building had been blown from its founda| 
tions, my first attention was given to them. ‘The specifications required that th 
foundation posts should be 5 feet long. Ifound them from 2 feet 10 inches to 
feet 8inches. The specifications required the posts to be placed in the groun 
8 feet 10 inches and well rammed. Ifound them from 10 to 15 inches only in th 
groundand notrammed. The specifications required the posts to be 14 inche; 
above ground. I found them from 2 to 24 feet. 
The specifications required that the sills should be well spliced and spiked to th 
posts. I found that they were neither spiked nor secured. No building anywher 
could be expected to remain any length of time upon such a foundation, the post} 
being unbraced and the sills unfastened to them, so that the first windstorm ha 
toppled the posts over and damaged the building. If, however, it had remaine: 
upon the foundation, the construction was so faulty that the building should neve: 
have been accepted. The specifications required that the joists of the second stor; 
should be 12 by 8 inches; instead they were 2 by 12. The joists were but 1 by 
the rafters were 2 by 8, instead of 3 by 9. The roof was to be closely sheathe: 
Instead of that the boards were from 2 to 2} inches apart. The rafters were no 
tied together with collar beams, and were already spread. A heavy weight of sno’ 
would crush it in entirely. The shingling was faulty and unworkmanlike. Thi 
specifications required that the windows should be supplied with cord and weight 
This was complied with only in the lower sash of the first-story windows, th 
upper sash being nailed solid into the frame and incapable of being lowered o 
raised. The window sills were poor, with insufficient pitch to throw off the rai 
Thin and common lass was placed in the windows, instead of the America: 
cylinder glass, double thick and free from all defects. Six-inch flooring was use 
instead of 4, which was required by the specifications. All but joints of the floo} 
were to be well nailed; so far as taken up they were not nailed at all. In the fron| 
stairway the heading between the step and the joist of the second floor allowed bu 
5 feet of space, causing all grown people to stoop in ascending the main stairwa: 
of the building. The specifications required that all chimney places should bj 
kept clear of all woodwork by a space of 1} inches. Ina number of places I foun 
the terra-cotta chimneys to be held in place by the woodwork. The specification| 
required that all spaces between the flues and woodwork should be filled in solidl, 
with a mixture of slack lime and gravel; instead of this I found that the spac 
between the flues and the woodwork were filled in with ends of joist, studding 
and other pieces of lumber; and if the building had not blown down, it would ce: 
tainly have burned down the first winter that these chimneys were used. Desi 
ing the testimony of an expert builder, I had the work investigated by Mr. Jam 
Lamont, a carpenter of thirty-five years’ experience. I also had it examined b 
the carpenter from the United States cutter Bear—the Government carpente: 
Both of these men furnished written testimony to the fact that the building ha) 
not been erected according to the specifications or in a workmanlike manne! 
Consequently there was nothing else for me to report than that the Governme 
should decline to accept the building from the contractor's hands. 
MORAVIAN MISSIONS,

Helmich, Miss Mary Mack, J. H. Romig, M. D., Miss P. King. Not long ago tw 
American gentlemen traveling in Alaska approached the Kuskokwim distric’ 
They heard the natives everywhere in the region talking about the “ Kilbuck 
muks,” and expected to meet with some tribe hitherto unknown to ethnologist: 
Presently they reached Bethel, where they found the missionaries, and discovere
-P-A-G-E-485
EDUCATION IN. ALASKA. 1443 
that the new tribe consisted of the converts in the neighborhood of Bethel, who 
were thus nicknamed, much as their teachers might deprecate it. The enrollment 
of pupils in the school was 33. Six of the boys formed an advanced class under 
special instructions, so that in the course of time they may be efficient assistants 
in the work of uplifting their people. 
Last fall Miss King, the trained nurse at the station, in getting into a native boat 
had a narrow escape from drowning in the Kuskokwim River. The water was deep 
where she fell in, and but for the timely assistance of one of the oarsmen theacci- 
dent would have been serious. Through the winter Mr. Helmich was at work 
building a 40-foot boat. He had few tools, and says that no onerealizes how many 
little things go to make a boat until he makes every piece himself. Finally the boat 
was launched, a complete success. May the Swan have along life of usefulness. 
A feature of the work of the Moravians in the Kuskokwim is a series of trips to 
villages in that region. Sixteen such trips were made between November and 
May, covering a distance of 1,500 miles. The benign influences of Christian civil- 
ization are making themselves widely felt, In helping the unfortunate the people 
have shown a hearty willingness to do what they could. Thanksgiving Day was 
the time set for a general contribution to help the poor. In all the villages between. 
Bethel and Ougavig, as wellas at these two places, the people brought to the chapels 
dried salmon, white fish, money, fur for barter and for clothing, tea, and flour. 
Many a poor unfortunate heart was gladdened by a gift from this store. 
Ougavig.—Missionaries, Rey. and Mrs. E. L. Weber. The new schoolroom is 
commodious and satisfactory in every way. The enrollment was 25. Owing to 
high water, the mission family were compelled to live with the native trader on 
the other side of the river for ten days during May. 
Carmel.—Missionaries, Rev. and Mrs. John Schoechert, Misses Mary and Emma 
Huber. The scarcity of food seems to have been more severely felt here than at 
the other stations in this region, and there was great suffering in the village on 
account of it. The school has become more attractive, so that all applicants could 
not bereceived. It seems impossible to retain the girls longer than their thirteenth 
or fourteenth year, when parents insist on removing them, as it is considered their 
duty to be married at that age. 
Eight journeys into the neighboring region were made, either by dog team or 
pidarka. The longest trip occupied twenty-three days, the distance being esti- 
mated at 800 miles. On other occasions 200 to 400 miles were traversed. The 
mission property has been improved by the erection of a storehouse, the purchase 
of a log house, and the construction of a new dock. 
BAPTIST MISSIONS, 
The work of the Baptist Church in Alaska is confined to the school and mission 
work of the Woman’s American Baptist Home Missionary Society, with headquar- 
ters in Boston. Their work first commenced in 1886, when Mrs. W. E. Roscoe, 
wife of the Government teacher at Kodiak, was commissioned by the ladies to do 
such mission work as she could. In the spring of 1893 Mr. Roscoe, having resigned. 
his position as teacher at Kodiak, was sent with his wife by the missionary society 
to establish a Baptist mission home and orphanage at Wood Island, one of the 
smaller islands in the harbor of Kodiak. In the midst of much opposition and 
petty persecution, he secured the material and erected a large two-story building | 
for the use of the mission. This building is beautifully located on a small fresh- 
water lake about 100 yards from the seashore. In June, 1895, he was relieved of 
the care of the station by the arrival of the Rey. and Mrs. P. Curtis Coe, allowing 
Mr. Roscoe and his family to return to California for the education of their chil- 
dren. Mr. Roscoe was very successful in laying the foundations of the present 
prosperous mission. In July Miss Hattie Snow was appointed to assist at the 
station. Mr. and Mrs. Coe and Miss Snow and Miss L. Goodchild compose the 
present mission force. During last summer and fall Mr. Coe, with the assistance 
lof the mission boys, cleared one side of the front yard of stumps, and secured hay 
for the family cow, taught the boys carpentering, and looked after things gener- 
ally. The girls have taken lessons in making and mending clothes and in cooking. 
‘During the winter a night school was held for the natives of the village, and on 
the Sabbath preaching was sustained both at Wood Island and at Kodiak. The 
first Baptist Church of Alaska was organized July 26, 1896, and on the following 
26th of September work was commenced on a chapel building. There are 25 
children in the orphanage. 
METHODIST MISSIONS. 
The work of the Methodist Church in Alaska is carried on under the auspices 
lof the Woman’s Home Missionary Society. On the 20th of January, 1880, the 
   
-P-A-G-E-486
  1444 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
board of missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church in New York selected Una- 
laska, the commercial metropolis of western Alaska, as the proper place for the 
commencement of missions. Through a combination of circumstances, how- 
ever, work was not commenced at that point until the summer of 1889, when Mr. 
and Mrs. John A. Tuck, Methodists from Maine, were sent out to establish a school 
and home. In 1890 the home was commenced by the bringing to Mr. and Mrs. 
Tuck of two orphan (waits) girls from the island of Attoo, a thousand miles west 
of Unalaska. The teachers were in a small story-and-a-half cottage (half of which 
was used as a schoolroom) and unprepared to receive any children into their 
family. But the waifs had to be received; there was nowhere else for them to go. 
Other girls, finding that two had actually received a home, came and refused to be 
driven away, and some weeks later six additional orphan girls were sent down 
from the seal islands by the United States Treasury agent, and the school contin- 
ued to grow until 35 girls were being sheltered, clothed and fed, and instructed. 
During the years 1889, 1890, and 1891 the mission was a contract school with the 
Government; but in 1892, in obedience to the action of the parent society, the 
women were compelled to withdraw from the work so important and so success- 
fully commenced. To disband the home, however, and turn out into the street 
the many homeless orphans that had for a little time experienced the comforts of 
a Christian home was to send them forthwith to a speedy ruin, and was not to be 
thought of for a moment. Mr. and Mrs. Tuck did bravely and heroically at 
their end of the line. Friends in the East assisted by raising money to tide them 
over, well knowing that when the authorities of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
understood the real condition of things they would authorize the women to resume 
their work in the home. This belief was borne out by after results. In 1893 the 
work was again resumed by the church, and hailed with prayerful enthusiasm by 
church brothers and Methodist women whose hearts had been touched and sym- 
pathy enlisted at the sad condition of the natives of western Alaska. The school 
has been so successful that through all that region it is held up as a model for 
other schools to pattern after. 
Capt. M. A. Healy (a Roman Catholic) sent me the following testimony:

by the contractor that it may have to be taken down and rebuilt from the foun

In 1895 Miss Agnes L. Sowle, of Hagaman, N. Y., was appointed to take charge 
of the home in the place of Mr, John A. Tuck, who is to give his whole time to the 
Governmentschool. Miss Elizabeth Mellor, of Brooklyn, N. Y., was sent as her 
assistant. This past summer Miss Sarah J. Rinch, of Canada, has-been added to 
the mission force. Under tle wise and efficient administration of these ladies the 
mission work in the Jesse Lee Memorial Home of the Methodist women at Unalaska 
continues to hold its advanced position. 
PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL MISSIONS. 
The most notable event of the past year was the appointment, by the general 
convention of the church in Minneapolis, of Rev. Peter Trimble Rowe as bishop 
of Alaska. Mr. Rowe was consecrated in St. George’s Church, New York City, 
November 30, 1895, and last spring moved to Alaska. After visiting the south- 
eastern part of Alaska, he crossed the Chilkoot Pass from Dyea Inlet to the head 
waters of the Yukon River. Passing down the river, he was able to visit all the 
villages on that wonderful stream, then securing passage from St. Michael to 
Unalaska with the revenue cutter Bear, then by mail boat visiting the several 
leading villages on the coast between Unalaska and Sitka. Mission work was 
established at Juneau with Rey. Henry Beer in charge, and at Douglas Island 
with Rev. A. J. Campbell in charge. On the bishop’s way down the Yukon River 
he had erected a log cabin for services and employed William Lalo as lay reader 
among the Indians. At Circle City he secured a suitable location for the erection 
of mission buildings and a hospital which the church proposed establishing at 
that point. 
Tho mission work of the Rev. Jules L. Prevost at St. James, Fort Adams, con- 
tinues to prosper. Sixteen boys and girls were registered in the boarding home 
and 79 enrolled in the day school. In the hospital connected with the mission, 2,238 
meals were supplied and 31 patients treated. Of these, 21 were discharged cured, 
3 were improved, 1 was unimproved, 4 (allinfants) died. At the dispensary there 
were 347 treatments. In the country tributary to this mission and counted with it 
are 1,298 baptized persons, of whom 50 are communicants. There were during the 
year 162 religiousservices held, 55 baptisms, 13 marriages, 19 burials. Of theburials, 
1 was brought 20 miles; 4, 35 miles; 2, 80 miles; 1, 200 miles, and 1, 300 miles. A 
steam launch has this year been secured for the use of the mission up and down 
the rivers, and will probably do much to extend the work. At Anvik the Rey. 
John W. Chapman reports 8 pupils in the boarding department of the mission and 
a number in the day school; 106 adherents of the mission, 10 of whom are com- 
municants. He further reports that during the year 8 baptisms, 2 marriages, and 
4 burials were performed. Since this station was established, in 1887, one-third of 
the native population have abandoned their underground huts and built them- 
selves comfortable log houses, one striking result of which is the improved health 
of the people. Up to the present year not a single death has occurred in the log 
fhouses, while in the underground houses nearly one-half of the children born have 
died. 
Dr. Mary Glenton, who has for the past two years performed the medical sery- 
ices in all that region. has felt compelled to resign her position and return to the 
States on account of her health. The work of St. Thomas mission, at Point Hope,on 
the Arctic Ocean, has been continued through the year by Rev. E. H. Edson. On 
ithe 6th of August, 1895, Dr. Driggs, who had for five years occupied that station, 
sailed for the States, leaving Mr. Edson alone at that frortier station. The tem- 
orary interests of that distant community were wellserved. Thirty-three whales, 
58 white polar bears, and the usual number of seals had been secured by the native 
opulation. This had given them an abundance of food through the winter. One 
orning the schoolboys reported tracks of a polar bear near the schoolhouse, and 
‘pon investigation it was found that the bear had been around the house and 
isited the wood pile during the night and then crossed over to the village, where 
e was. killed by a native. Seventy children were enrolled in the school. During 
he winter a night school was established for those that worked during the day.   
CONGREGATIONAL MISSIONS. 
Last spring Mr. W. T. Lopp and family, who, with Mr. Thornton, were the 
first missionaries to Cape Prince of Wales, Bering Straits, returned to his field of 
ork after a vacation of one year in the States among his friends, During his 
bsence in the winter of 1895-96 the station was maintained and work kept up

acquire a better command of the native language, the work will progress more 
rapidly. i 
ROMAN CATHOLIC MISSIONS. 
No complete report has been received of their operations. They have a mission 
school and hospital at Juneau, Alaska; also at Nulato, Koserefski, Akulurak, and 
Cape Vancouver. They are talking of establishing a mission and hospital at 
Circle City; also a school at St. Michael. At Koserefski they report 79 boarders 
in the mission school and 26 day scholars. At Akulurak they report 25 boardersin 
the mission home. Their work has a force of 1 vicar apostolic, 9 priests, 6 lay 
brothers, and 18 sisters of the Order of St. Ann. 
PRESBYTERIAN MISSIONS. 
The Home Missionary Society of this denomination has the distinction of hav- 
ing, at Point Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost mission in the world. Mr. L. M. 
Stevenson, who went there in 1890, is still holding the fort waiting for someone t 
relieve him. During the past year a comfortable mission building, with a con- 
venient storehouse nearby, has beenerected. In thesummer of 1895 the brig W. H, 
Meyer, which had in cargo.the annual supplies for this mission, was wrecked in| 
Port Clarence. Consequently the mission school had to be discontinued for th 
want of supplies that werelost. Mr. Stevenson, however, remained at his post and] 
held religious services as best he could under the circumstances. Mr. H. Rich: 
mond Marsh, a young medical student from Illinois, with his bride, is expecte 
to go to Point Barrow next season and take charge of the work at that point. A: 
has been said in previous reports, this station on the seas, where the ice neve: 
melts, has but one communication a year with the outside world. The annual 
mail which was sent to the station in the spring of 1895 has not yet reached it: 
destination, but, if it has no further mishaps, will finally get there in the fall o1 
1897, two years and six months after it left the States. 
St. Lawrence Island.—Mr. and Mrs. V.C. Gambell, with true heroism, continue: 
on this important subarctic field. Mrs. Gambell reports as follows: 
‘‘Our winter comes the last of September and lasts until the middle of June. 
The lowest point reached by the mercury was 29° below zero. When the wind i 
from the southeast, the snow drifts on the west side of the house until the hous 
is nearly out of sight, snow being 3 feet deep on the roof. When the storm is over. 
the natives come with their shovels, made of the shoulder blade of the walrus, oy 
baby whale, and shovel us out. Sometimes the air is so full of snow that we cai 
not see the storehouse, which is only 20 feet away. There was snow in the villag 
until the middle of July, and it lies on the mountain, a mile east of the village, a! 
summer, 
“We go out after school for an hour or so nearly every day, the whole schoo! 
going with us. We do not mind the cold, for we dress from head to foot in rein. 
deer skins. 
“Formerly the people lived in underground houses, but have not done soin thi: 
village for a number of years. The houses which they now use are round walls. 
about 6 feet high, and made of driftwood and portions of wrecks. They cove 
them with walrus skins. The door is about 2} feet from the ground and about 2) 
feet square. It is always placed on the west. On the inside a room is partitione: 
off with deerskins, about 7 feet wide and as far around the wall as is needed] 
Only five or six people live in some of the houses; in others there are over twent; 
occupants. 
“Their rooms are heated with oil lamps, the oil used being either seal, walrus 
or whale, The lamps are made of clay. I hayeastone lamp which I procured o 
the Siberian side. It is the same in shape as those used by the people on St. Law 
rence Island. 
«The walrus skins are dried on frames in the open air in summer, but the sea] 
skins are stretched close to the ceiling in the living rooms. When the seal skin 
are dried, the women scrape and rub them until they are very soft and easy t 
make into clothing. They shape the boot soles, which are made of the big seal] 
with their teeth. 
“There are no trees on the island. Thereis alittle shrub resembling the willo 
which creeps along on the ground like a strawberry vine. There are some bea’ 
tiful flowers. Forget-me-nots, daisies, monks’ hood, and the dandelion gro’ 
everywhere, while the buttercups come before the snow is off the ground. 
“The house we live in is 20 by 40 feet, the schoolroom being in the north end| 
On Sunday the room is nearly always crowded. When the tables and benches ar 
full, the people who can not be thus accommodated sit on the floor. They do no

mind this in the least, as they have no chairs in their own homes. Sometimes it 
is so crowded that it is almost impossible to move around. 
“The pupils that have attended school with any degree of regularity have made 
good progress in their studies and greatly improved in their personal appearance. 
They read well, write legibly, and are quick at number work. One boy had kept 
a list of all the words that had been given him, and, when he understood the 
arrangement of the dictionary, made an alphabetical list of them in a blank book 
that had been given him. This he did without any suggestions from anyone.” 
Haines.—This station, among the Chilkats, is occupied by Rev. and Mrs. W. W. 
Warne, Mrs. A. M. Sheets, and Miss Fannie Willard (native). Tho religious 
interest of the preceding year has continued during the present, and the teachers 
have been rejoicing that those for whom they labor and yearn have so many of 
them been brought into the kingdom. 
The desire to attend meeting so overcrowded the church as to make some fric- 
tion between the inhabitants of the-different villages. They were like the Gre- 
cians of old, who thought that their wives were neglected in the daily distribution 
of bread. This inability to get into the church finally led to a compromise by 
which certain services were given to the inhabitants of certain villages, so that 
by rotation the people of each village would have an opportunity to-get into the 
church. In January, 1896, the building burned down and the regularity of the 
services was somewhat impaired. During the past summer a larger and more 
commodious building has been erected for the mission. At the Chilkat Fishing 
Station the schoolhouse, which was intended to seat 40, has been crowded with 
attendance of considerably over 100; sometimes 140 to 150 being present, and many 
compelled to go away for lack of room. At another village where services are 
held matters are scarcely any better, so that in addition to new mission building 
at Haines there is important need of two chapels at the outer villages. Winter 
prayer meetings are held at both of these villages, and from twenty to thirty prayers 
are often offered by the natives at a single meeting. Some pray in public who do 
not profess to be Christians, but pray for the light. Many have confessed their 
sins, and though some may go no further, yet many are coming into the kingdom. 
Hoonah.—This station, among a barbarous and uncivilized people, 60 miles by sea 
from a post-office or white community, has been led by two widow ladies, Mrs. 
John W. McFarland and Mrs. Mary E. Howell. Mrs. McFarland has served in 
the mission work for seventeen years, andgupon the death of her husband three 
years ago continued the work at the station where they resided, teaching the 
natives, nursing their sick, settling their quarrels, and administering generally the 
affairs of the village, and also preaching the gospel on the Sabbath to the native 
church of 100 communicants. A year ago the tragedy connected with the killing 
of the last Indian medicine man in the place has resulted in good by freeing the 
community from their cruelty and rapacity. Some of the officials in years past 
have denied the existence of witchcraft in Alaska, for fear the knowledge of it 
would check immigration; but it still exists, and will continue to exist until 
every native village is leavened out of its superstition by the introduction of the 
gospel and the blessing of the Spirit of God. Such scenes as the following are 
still witnessed in that country. 
“Some of our people took a sick man across the sound to the other Hoonah 
village to have the Indian doctor perform over him. The doctor charged.one of 
the party with being a witch, whereupon the young man became so enraged that 
he shot the doctor dead. Then he, with his friends, fled for this village. Early 
the next morning a large canoe filled with bloodthirsty men, whooping and firing 
off their guns, made their appearance. After a war dance on the beach they 
marched up to the house, demanding the man. For over an hour they tried in 
vain to settle with blankets. ‘No! No! Life for life!’ was the cry. Then the 
poor man came out and gaye himself up and was shot down by two of the Indian 
doctor’sfriends. One gun, being accidentally discharged, wounded one of our men 
in the limb. Peace is now restored and I hope the old Indian doctor’s death will 
end witchcraft among this tribe. A year ago he charged one of our schoolboys 
with being a witch, and had the sick man shoot him, after which a stone was tied 
around his neck and the body dropped into the bay.” 
Juneau.—The mission home at this place is prospering under the care of Rey. 
and Mrs. L. F. Jones, Miss Sue Davis, Miss M. E. Gould, and Mr. Frederick Moore, 
native. Mrs. Jones gives the following graphic picture of native life with which 
they deal: 
_ ‘*We have reached the far end of the village and will pay our first visit. Enter- 
ing a small room, built more in the form of a shed than a house, we find it full of 
all sorts of things, except furniture. The room is in utter confusion, while 
dirt is seen everywhere. Sitting upon two blankets spread on the floor and witha

cracker box for a support to her back is an old woman dying with consumption. 
We do what we can for her comfort, relieving her present necessities. Leaving some 
medicine, we continue on our way. The house we now enter consists of a single 
room, where live members of six families. Two rude bedsteads stand in one end 
of the room. An old stove in the middle of the apartment is giving off far more 
smoke than heat. About the stove are scattered a few dishes,.pots, and pans. 
Nailed to the side of the wall to dry isa bear skin. Bunches of fish hang overhead. 
Several boxes painted in allegorical figures—receptacles for clothing—and_ an old 
chair are the only furniture. Lying on the floor near the stove, with one thin blanket 
for a bed and an old coat for a pillow, is a young man, suffering from a gun wound 
through thearm. During the night several boat loads of people, friends of his 
family, have arrived from a distance, bringing with them a dead body for inter- 
ment. These visitors are all assembled in the room with the sick man, some 
mourning over their dead, others eating their breakfast, some smoking, and others 
sleeping. Children are singing, crying, and playing by turns, or all at the same 
time. As we advance to the side of the sick man we are obliged to step over sleep- 
ing forms on the floor. The atmosphere! Words are too feeble to describe it. 
The patience of the suffering Christian is beautiful to see. His face brightens as 
we speak words of cheer and comfort. After washing and dressing his arm, we 
offer a short prayer, cheered to know that we have been able to alleviate suffering. 
“Tn that little hut we are approaching is one sick with a disease no medicine 
can reach save the ‘Balm in Gilead.’ That misery is the white man’s stamp. 
. ‘But as the morning is far spent we will hasten on to pay our last visit. As we 
approach this Christian home our hearts grow lighter, for we know within will be 
seen the fruits of mission labors of past years. We enter a large room in perfect 
order, scant of furniture, to be sure, but a home where comfort and cleanliness are 
conspicuous. We ask for a-drink of water; Jennie, the young wife, goes to a cup- 
board and brings forth two glasses with no little pride, handing them to her hus- 
band, who has just entered the room with a pail full of fresh spring water. 
“On a cot, neat and clean, rests the sick brother. Jennie’s floor is as whiteas a 
new kitchen table. A few large picturesillustrating Bible lessons are on the walls. 
At one end of the room is the dinner table, clean and nice, while at the other endis 
the bed, which looks inviting and restful with its white spread and snowy pillow- 
cases. Asewing machine, with a partly finished shirt on it, stands by one window. 
The stove would.almost serve for a mirror if there were no other at hand. And 
this is only one of the neat, comfortable homes in Alaska resulting from the teach- 
ing and example of the missionaries.” 
During the year the Rev. James H. Condit has been sent to take charge of the 
white church at Juneau and has entered upon his work with enthusiasm. 
Sitka.—This central-mission station continues to maintain the lead in mission 
work. It has the most complete set of buildings‘and appliances for carrying on 
mission work and much the largest force of employees. This is probably equal to 
the communicants of all the other Protestant churches in Alaska combined. The 
hospital in connection with the mission continues to reach a large number of 
atients from places 160 to 800 miles away by sea. Some have been received from 
Gouper River, 500 miles away, and the Aleutian Islands, 1,200 miles away. Some 
months ago a number of native Christians from Sitka went to Kluck-Won, partly 
to get work and partly to carry the-gospel to their own people. They established 
and have maintained regular prayer meetings, under the lead of Robert Harris, for 
many years a pupil in the Sitka mission school. 
Fort Wrangel.—This oldest Presbyterian mission station in Alaska is occupied 
by Rey. and Mrs. Clarence Thwing, who writes encouragingly of the progress of 
the work in that village. 
Jackson.—Owing to the want of funds, which so greatly hampers the mission 
work of all the churches through Alaska, as well as other portions of the United 
States, the mission home at this place has been discontinued, and thus a portion of 
the girls have been transferred to the homeat Sitka, with Miss A. J. Manning their 
teacher. A new church was completed last year at the station, to the great joy of 
the community. At one of the meetings a native seeking Christ thus prayed: 
“Tord, open my eyes and teach my heart how you would have me live before you.” 
Another said: ‘‘ If we were strong, like large new canoes, we would just ride over 
oe temptations and not have them wash over us. just as a new, strong canoe does

THE SWEDISH EVANGELICAL MISSION COVENANT’S MISSIONS IN ALASKA. 
We are indebted to the Rev. D. Nyvall, secretary of the Swedish Evangelical 
Mission Covenant, for this synopsis of their work.

       The missions in Alaska, now promoted by the Swedish Evangelical Mission 
Covenant of America, were founded, 1886, by the Swedish Evangelical Mission 
Covenant of Sweden, which that year sent to Alaska their first missionaries: 
Mr. Adolph Lydell to Yakutat, to work there among the Thlingets; and Mr. Axel 
E. Karlson to Unalaklik, to take up work among the Eskimos, the Indians, and 
the Russians (half-breeds) of that region. Two years later, 1888, Mr. K. J. Hen- 
dricksen was sent to the Yakutat mission. Inthe year 1889 two more mission- 
aries were sent from the old country to the Alaska stations, namely, Mr. August 
Anderson to Unalaklik and Mr. Albin Johnson to Yakutat. 
In the meantime it was, among the missionaries themselves, discussed how much 
more natural it would be to have the new missions in Alaska stand under the con- 
trol and lead of the American Covenant, rather than of the far-off Swedish society. 
The missionaries had all of them traveled through America to their destination, 
and were greatly affected by the love and help given them everywhere in America. 
Mr. Lydell, whose health did not permit him to stay long at one time in Yakutat, 
made several journeys through the States in the interest of the Alaska missions. 
At last the missionaries submitted their wishes to their board in Sweden, which 
readily accepted their plan, and formally, 1889, turned the mission over to the 
American society. 
In the year 1891 the society strengthened the forces at the several stations by 
sending Mr. David Johnson and Miss Hanna Svenson (now Mrs. A. E. Karlson) 
to Unalaklik, and Miss Agnes Wallén (now: Mrs. Albin Johnson) to Yakutat. 
One year later, 1892, Miss ‘Selma Peterson and Miss Anna Carlson weresent to 
Yakutat, the last mentioned returning the year after on account of failing health. 
In 1893 Miss Malvina Johnson was sent to Unalaklik and Mr. N. O. Hultberg to 
Golovin Bay to open the new station there, and, 1894, Miss Hanna Holm (now 
Mrs. Hultberg) followed. During the year 1895 no missionary was sent, owing 
to the hard times, but, 1896, the society called two school-teachers, one, Mr. P. H. 
Anderson, for Golovin Bay, and one, Miss Hulda Cecilia Peterson, for Yakutat. 
Their entire corps of white workers in Alaska, including Mr. P. H. Anderson, 
is 14—7 men and 7 women. Besides they have in the service of their mission one 
Eskimo, by the name of Rock, working as an evangelist in connection with their 
northern stations, with such success as to give the missionaries occasion to call 
him ‘‘the Paul of the Eskimos.” Another coworker is a Russian, Stephan Ivanoff, 
who, with his wife, has superintended an outstation at Kangekosook, until this 
winter, when he was obliged to give up that station and join the station at 
Unalaklik, because of the urgent need of more workers there. In connection with 
the mission are also the Eskimo girl Dora, a native nurse, and Frank Kameroff, a 
young Russian, serving as an interpreter, both located at the northern stations, 
making, in all, four native workers atpresent. Their stations are, as already men- 
tioned, the following: Yakutat, Unalaklik, and Golovin Bay, besides an outsta- 
tion at Kangekosook. 
Yakutat is the nearest and most easily reached,'and_is superintended by Mr. 
K. J. Hendrikson, with the aid of Mr. Albin Johnson, Mrs. Albin Johnson, Miss 
Selma Peterson, and Miss Hulda Cecilia Peterson, the school- teacher. ‘Albin 
Johnson with his wife and infant son is at present in the States, but intends to 
return early in June. 
At this station the society has been able to place a sawmill to the service of the 
mission, with the best results. In fact, in seven years a whole little village of 
clean beautiful frame houses has been built, where formerly were only wretched 
huts. The natives have readily taken to carpentering, and they not only build 
their own houses, under the direction of Mr. Hendrikson, but also have learned 
to make many kinds of furniture until then unknown to them. In one word, the 
sawmill has proven an effective help in civilizing the natives and thereby opening 
a way for the Christian mission among them. 
The congregation of converted natives at Yakutat, formally received into Chris- 
tian fellowship by the missionaries, numbers about 20. 
Five children are at present wholly cared for at the station. And itis to be 
moticed that this special work of charity was badly interfered with by the acci- 
ident of the burning some years ago of the orphans’ home, which the society has not 
las yet been able to rebuild. 
The mission school is frequented by 60 to 100 children, or atan average, 45. Not 
only the English language and other elements of a primary-school education are 
aught, but also useful industries, both to the boys and girls, such as knitting and 
ewing; and the girls are reported to learn very quickly and eagerly. 
At Unalaklik is the'largest station. The superintendent is Mr. A. E. Karlson, 
ne of the founders of our missions in Alaska. He has to his aid his wife and Miss 
alvina Johnson, besides Mr. David Johnson, the school-teacher. Of Mr. Karlson’s

hardships and triumphs many tales could be told if time and space permitted. 
Without the help of a sawmill and other facilities; with the aid only of an ax and 
his energy, he has built the station. Often has he experienced the greatest perils, 
even coming near risking his life for the gun or knife of the native, or at sea dur- 
ing stormy seasons while crossing the bay in order to provide his station with the 
necessaries of life from St. Michael or inland, in his many missionary journeys among 
the tribes living between Unalaklik and Golovin Bay. But he has until now been 
protected; and the last six years he has been nobly assisted by Mr. David John- 
son, a young man of great courage and self-denying zeal. This Mr. Johnson has 
during the last two years made several missionary journeys farther north as far 
as Kotzebue Sound, in company with the Eskimo Evangelist Rock. Many were 
the perils and the hardships of the young missionaries upou these journeys. The 
whole of Christmas night, 1895, they were obliged to bivouac in the cold arctic 
region beneath the starry sky, without any other protection than their sleighs offered. 
And still this young man, with an apostle’s heart, asks of the society the privilege 
to be allowed to work in the same manner among the tribes farthest in the north, 
even offering himself to go without salary and eating the fare of the natives for a 
-time, if only the society would consent to open a new station at the Kotzebue 
Sound. 
The congregation of converted natives numbers about 50. At present not more 
than 15 children are wholly cared for at the station. 
The children enrolled at the mission school are reported to be 90, of whom 50 are 
under 10 years of age, 20 under 15, the rest under 30 years of age. The best attend- 
ance is reported during March, with an average of 40, the next best in January 
and February, with 35, and October, November, December, with 25. During May 
only 15 attended, and in September fewer still (no exact figure given). These 
changes in the number of pupils is to be explained from the native half-nomadic 
mode of living. In the Sunday school at Unalaklik 175 children at the most have 
been gathered; and great was the joyful surprise for the poor little ones of the Christ- 
mas feast given them last Christmas eve, with a Christmas tree, burning in all its) 
glory, and many small presents in the way of clothing, sweetmeats, and other good 
things liberally bestowed upon half-clothed, half-starved boys and girls, who showed 
their appreciation by laughter and tears continually alternating the whole even- 
ing, the greatest evening of their life. 
Golovin Bay is the youngest station, and was opened 1892, and Mr. N. O. Hult- 
berg, the superintendent of the station, was sent forthwith to take up work at the 
new place. He is now aided by his wife and Mr. August Anderson, and will be 
further assisted from next summer by P. H. Anderson, the school-teacher. 
The success at Golovin Bay, the first and especially the second winter, exceeded 
all their expectations and former experiences, the report numbering the baptized 
during the winter of 1894 aloneas over 20, The congregation of converted natives 
is at present 30 in number. 
‘The attendance at the mission school is 40,a number which could be easily 
doubled, as there are hundreds of children living a few miles around the station, 
were it not for the small schoolhouse, which can accommodate no more. 
A brief summary of their work in Alaska is as follows: 
(1) They expend yearly between $8,000 and $10,000 in Alaska. And this expend- 
iture may be better understood when it is stated that all the members of alll 
the churches in connection with the covenant do not number more than 10,030, 
including both women and men, most of these being persons of small means. 
(2) As an immediate fruit of their missions there, is counted a Christian con- 
gregation of at least 100 natives. 
(8) About 300 children are instructed at their mission schools. 
(4) About’ 20 children are cared for at the mission stations. 
(5) In connection with their missionary efforts, a great work of civilization is 
going on, not only at the stations, but through the influences of the missionaries.     
    
      
       
    
   
    
               
    
   
    
    
   
              
   CHURCH OF ENGLAND. 
The diocese of Selkirk, while having its stations on the Canadian side of the| 
boundary line, yet ministers to the natives and miners both of Canada and Alaska. 
The demoralization of the Indians, through intemperance and other vices intro- 
duced among them by the large influx of gold miners, is very marked, and has| 
become a great hindrance to missionary work. Archdeacon and Mrs. T. H. Can 
han, who have for many years labored in that arctic region, this season returned| 
to England on account of their health. 
The governor of Alaska, referring to the operations of the various Christian| 
denominations in Alaska and also to the Government schools, stated in his annual

report to the Government that ‘‘the teacher and the missionary, the church and 
the school, have exerted a more potent influence for the elevation, civilization, ,

IntTRopUCTION OF DomMESTIC REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 
During the year a comfortable log schoolhouse 22 by 32 feet, together with a 
woodhouse and bell tower for the same, has been erected for the use of the chil- 
dren of the employees at the Teller Reindeer station. The building has attracted 
considerable attention from its neat and comfortable appearance. The main head- 
quarters building was enlarged with an addition 24 by 40 feet, built in connection 
with it. This addition gives accommodation for a storeroom, and also for the 
herders’ families who may be sojourning temporarily at the station. It furnishes 
accommodations for keeping seal meat, oil, blubber, dried and frozen fish; also a) 
carpenter’s bench, with facilities for manufacturing sleds and snowshoes. In the 
attic is furnished much needed room for storing sails, boat oars, and fishing nets. | 
In addition to the buildings erected at the station, huts made of plank and drift-' 
wood, covered with sod and dirt, were erected at several convenient points for the 
accommodation of the herders passing between the herd and the main station in 
winter. During the severe storms of last winter these huts were found of very 
great value, and probably in some instances saved lives. Similar huts were also 
erected at the winter camp for the use of the herders. 
PERSONNEL, 
After a sea voyage of thirty-seven days, Mr. J. C. Widstead, who had been 
appointed assistant superintendent of the station, reached Port Clarence July 12 
on the brig W. H, Meyer. Two days later, the supplies for the station being safely 
landed, a southerly wind springing up so increased in violence that the vessel was 
driven ashore from her anchorage and became a total wreck. With the wrecking 
of the vessel were lost the supplies of the schools at Bering Straits and also Point 
Barrow, together with the personal effects of the Rev. Thomas Hanna and family, 
who were en route to their station at Cape Prince of Wales. 
Owing to some misunderstanding and friction which arose over the sale of the 
wrecked vessel, Mr. William A. Kjellmann sent his resignation to Mr, William 
Hamilton, who represented the Bureau. As there was nothing else to be done, 
the resignation was accepted, and on July 20 Mr. J. C. Widstead was appointed 
superintendent, with Mr. Thorwald Kjellmann as assistant superintendent. Mr. 
Widstead had been selected for a subordinate position, but in the absence of any 
other more suitable person in that region he was necessarily given the first place 
upon the resignation of Mr. Kjellmann. His administration during the past year 
was not a success, and upon my arrival at the station, July 28, 1896, I removed 
him and reappointed Mr. William A. Kjellmann superintendent and Albert N. 
Kittilsen, M. D., assistant superintendent, who had been sent up from the States 
this season for service at the station. 
During last year some dissatisfaction was expressed by the Lapps that there was 
no physician within reach for their families. This want has been supplied by the 
appointment of Dr. Kittilsen as assistant superintendent of the station. The 
seven families of Lapps have remained with the herd, performing their usual duties:
-P-A-G-E-495
  
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA, 1453 
with efficiency and success. The experience of the past two years has demon- 
strated the wisdom of their importation as instructors to the Eskimos in the care 
and management of deer. Their success has been so marked that hereafter, when- 
ever a herd is loaned to a mission station, an experienced Lapp will be sent with 
the herd to take charge of and instruct the apprentices. 
Under the tuition and direction of the experienced and skilled Lapps were ten 
Eskimo apprentices from different villages extending all the way from Point Hope 
on the Arctic shore southward and eastward to Fort Adams on the Upper Yukon 
River, a distance of 2,000 miles. These apprentices have made fair progress in 
mastering the science of managing and breeding reindeer. 
In January, Moses, Tatpan, Martin, and Okweetkoon were transferred from the 
Teller Reindeer Station to the new station established on Golovin Bay, they hay- 
ing come originally from that general region of country. 
During the fall, Oozhaloo, one of the most prominent natives at Point Barrow, 
with his family, was transported to the Teller Reindeer Station at his own request 
and accepted as an apprentice. It is hoped that ultimately he will be able to go 
back in charge of a herd to that distant and desolate northern section.     
   
               
         
   
                               
     
   
             
   
     
    HERDS. 
There are now five herds in Alaska, one at Cape Prince of Wales, a mission 
station of the Congregational Church, numbering 253; one at Cape Nome, in 
charge of three experienced Eskimo apprentices, numbering 218; two at Golovin 
Bay, one belonging to the Swedish Evangelical Mission Station and the other to 
the St. James Episcopal Mission Station, together numbering 206, and the central 
Government herd at the Teller Reindeer Station, numbering 423, making a total 
of 1,100 head. 
During the previous five years the transporting of reindeer from Siberia was 
done by the revenue cutter Bear. This year the Bear, having extra work in con- 
nection with the policing of the sea islands of Bering Sea, was unable to afford the 
usual assistance. In place of the Bear, arrangements were made with Mr. Minor 
W. Bruce to purchase the deer on the Siberian coast and deliver them to the Gov- 
ernment at so much a head on the Alaska shore. Through a combination 
of circumstances, however, he failed to carry out this contract, and the result 
was that no deer were purchased this season. It is perhaps as-well that this 
attempt to procure deer through private parties from Siberia has so signally failed, 
as the men who were selected to live in Siberia and do the purchasing were not 
such as were competent to suitably represent the United States Government. 
Russia had kindly given permission to the United States to purchase, but would 
naturally expect that the agents doing the work would be responsible men 
under the control of the United States Government. It is hoped that the Bureau 
of Education will this coming year be able to send its own agent on the field, and 
thus prevent any international complications arising from the misdoings or mis- 
takes of agents not responsible to the Government. But while there was no 
increase of the herd from importation, there was a very gratifying increase by 
birth. Four hundred and sixteen fawns were born to the herds last spring, of 
which 357 lived. 
-At the Teller Station there were at the opening of the year.525 head. On the 
14th of January, 1896, 130 of these were sent off to establish a new herd at 
Golovin Bay. 
During the year 25 died from accidents received during transportation from 
Siberia. Upon the second trip of the Bear the steamer encountered a severe gale 
and the reindeer were thrown helplessly from side to side across the deck, result- 
ing in dislocated joints and broken limbs and internal injuries, resulting in death» 
During the fall a hoof disease broke out in the herd, resulting in the death of 25. 
A portion of a diseased lung and liver was sealed up in alcohol, and has been sent 
to the Agricultural Department for diagnosis of the disease and a possible remedy. 
Ten male deer were killed during the aon for food. One hundred and forty-one 
fawns were born, of which 10 died. f the 423 deer at the station on the Ist of 
July, 1896, 15 are claimed by the apprentice Taootuk, 11 by Kummuk, 7 by Sekeog- 
look, 4 by Woksok, 4 by Electoona, and 3 by Ahlook, making 44 that are the private 
property of the apprentices. There are 7 head of female deer belonging to the 
Teller Station that are still in the herd at Cape Nome. 
In the herd at Cape Prince of Wales there are 253 head, of which 84 are fawns 
orn last spring. There are 5 herders or apprentices in charge of the herd. Some 
of the cows without fawns were milked, and the herd seemed to be prospering. 
The Cape Nome herd numbers 218, of which 43 were born last spring. During 
the spring 11 were killed in an avalanche as they were feeding at the base of a 
mountain.  
-P-A-G-E-496
  4 1454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
- The two herds at Golovin Bay aggregate 206, of which 80 were born last spring. 
Of this herd, the apprentice, Martin, claims 12 deer, Tatpan 7, Moses 21, and 
Okweetkoon 10, making 50 claimed by the herders as private property. 
The trip made in driving the herd from Port Clarence to Golovin Bay was a 
successful and interesting one, a full account of which is given by Mr. G. T. 
Howard. 
During the year at the Teller Station 22 deer were broken to harness, making 52 
sled deer in the herd. Much time was given to the training of these deer for 
freighting and traveling purposes. Seventeen sets of harness were made, 14 freight 
sleds, and a number of snowshoes and skis. But little difficulty has been met with 
during the past year from the dogs. 
DISTRIBUTION, 
In the general plan of distribution it has been our purpose to supply the mission 
stations, partly in the order of their proximity to the central herd, that the new 
herds may be more conveniently supervised, and partly through the interest which 
the stations have manifested in sending their young men for training. Hence the 
first station to receive a loan from the Government was the Congregational, at 
Bering Straits, 60 miles away from the central station. The superintendent of 
that mission was for one year (1893-94) superintendent of the reindeer station, and 
had around him a number of his young men as apprentices. About that time the 
report was maliciously circulated among the natives that they were not to receive 
any benefit from the reindeer; only the whites, To disabuse their minds, threo 
of the more advanced of the native herders were loaned (January 31, 1895) 100 
head of deer and sent off some 60 miles down the coast to Cape Nome by them- 
selves. This was the beginning of the third herd. 
Among the first stations to respond to the call for young men to learn the busi- 
ness was the Swedish station at Unalaklik, Norton Sound, and the St. James Epis- 
copal mission, on the Yukon. As the Swedish station was the next nearest to Port 
Clarence after the Congregationalists, and as they had had three young men in 
training, it was very proper that they should have the next or fourth herd, and 
while the Episcopal station at Fort Adams is more remote than the Roman Cath- 
olic station on the lower Yukon or the Presbyterian station on St. Lawrence 
Island, yet as that station had had an apprentice almost from the first in the herd 
and was a central point for the establishment of reindeer among a different race 
of DEEN in Alaska, it seemed appropriate to give the fifth herd to them, which 
was done. 
In arranging plans for tho distribution of the domestic reindeer in Alaska, so 
far as the native population are concerned, I have looked to the missionaries set- 
tled among them for cooperation and assistance. 
They are the wisest and most disinterested friends the natives have. From their 
position and work, haying learned the character and needs of the people, they can 
wisely direct the transfer of the ownership of the deer from the Government to 
such of the natives as have been trained in the care of the deer. 
And in order that the herders should have, in the infancy of the business, the 
continued oversight of experienced herders, and teaching in methods of handling 
by the most competent instructors, it is important that with every new herd sent 
out there shall also be sent a competent Lapp. In accordance with this purpose, 
the several missionary organizations at work in arctic and subarctic Alaska were 
last spring corresponded with by this office. 
In the commencement of the work it was anticipated that all the mission sta- 
tions would have ere this been furnished a loan of reindeer, but the increase 
through purchase in Siberia has been much smaller than was anticipated. Instead 
of being able to purchase a thousand or more head a year, the average increase 
by purchase has only been about 150 a year. This necessarily delays the distri- 
bution of deer, as it is not good policy to weaken unduly the central herd at Port 
Clarence, and of course we can not distribute more than we have. 
It is as important to teach the natives just emerging from barbarism how to 
earn an independent support as it is to give them bookinstruction. The industrial 
pursuit which nature has mapped out for the native population of arctic and sub- 
arctic Alaska is the breeding and herding of reindeer and the use of the deer as a 
means of transportation and intercommunication. 
During the past season the influx of miners into the Yukon region has made a very, 
urgent call for reindeer for freighting purposes. In the original plan for the pur-' 
chase and distribution of reindeer reference was mainly had to securing a new 
food supply for the famishing Eskimo, but it is now found that the reindeer are 
as essential to the white men as to the Eskimo. The wonderful placer mines of
-P-A-G-E-497
  
2 : EDUCATION IN ALASKA, ; 1455 
the Yukon region are situated from 25 to 100 miles from the great Yukon River. 
The provisions brought from the south and landed upon the banks of the river are 
with great difficulty transported to the mines. So great was the extremity last 
winter, that mongrel Indian dogs cost $100 to $200 each for transportation purposes, 
and the freight charges from the river to the mines, 30 miles, ranged from 15 to 20 
cents per pound. The difficulty experienced in providing the miners with the 
necessaries of life has demonstrated the necessity of reindeer transportation, and 
that the development of the large mining interests of that region will be dependent 
upon the more rapid introduction of reindeer for freighting. There are no roads 
in Alaska, and off of the rivers no transportation facilities to any great extent. 
In the limited traveling of the past dogs have been used for that purpose; but dog 
teams are slow and must be burdened with the food for their own maintenance. 
On the other hand, trained reindeer make in a day two or three times the distanco 
covered by a dog team, and at the end of the day can be turned loose to gather 
their support from the moss, which is always accessible to them. 
W. AH. Gilder, of the Century, in his trip across Siberia to telegraph to the Navy 
Department the burning of the United States naval vessel Rogers in St. Lawrence 
Bay, Siberia, 1882, says in his book, Ice Pack and Tundra,, page 190: - 
- “During a portion of the route we had horses for draft animals and at other 
times reindeer. I much prefer the latter, because so much fleeter and so much 
more docile.” 
Last spring an application was received from the United States Treasury Depart- 
ment for the placing of 40 reindeer on the Seal islands, and arrangements were 
made for complying with the request; but before the arrangements could be carried 
out I received a protest from the North American Commercial Company, who are 
the lessees of the islands, as they feared that the reindeer would disturb the’seal 
upon the rookeries. Consequently nothing was done in the matter. 
A number of influential parties, several being in the United States Congress, 
have expressed an earnest wish that a few reindeer might be placed upon each of 
the larger islands of the Aleutian group to provide a food supply for any crew that 
may hereafter be wrecked on those islands, and prevent the repetition of the starva- 
tion and cannibalism which occurred in 1894 on Umnak Island, one of the Aleutian 
group, in the wrecking of the whaling bark James Allen. When, June 14, the 
United States revenue cutter Bear, upon which I was a passenger, found the sur- 
vivors, there were nine left in a hut, crazed with starvation. They were gathered 
around the fire with a pot of human flesh on cooking, which they had cut from 
the body of a man who had died and been buried two weeks before. Upon per- 
ceiving the rescue party they gave a feeble hurrah, and, laughing and crying by 
turns, remarked that they were sorry to say that they were cannibals, but that 
starvation had stared them in the face and they were compelled to resort to the 
flesh of their dead companions for food. They reported that Gideon had died 
June 7, and they had eaten him. When he was gone, they had dug up Pena, who 
had been buried on May 30, and were now (June 14) eating him. When they 
reached the ship, they were so weak that some of them had to be carried and all 
of them helped to the forecastle, where the clothes, swarming with vermin and 
reeking in filth, were cut off of them and thrown overboard. They were then 
thoroughly washed and their hair cut. When stripped of their clothing, their 
emaciation showed their suffering. * 
Requests have also come from parties who haveleased some of the Alaska islands 
for the purpose of raising foxes. They are anxious in. connection with their fox 
ranches to try the experiment of raising reindeer for the market. 
In Ice Pack and Tundra, page 179, W. H. Gilder, speaking of the people of 
northeastern Siberia, thus testifies to the value of reindeer meat as a food: 
«‘Reindeer meat is also eaten by those who can afford it, unless rich enough to 
eat beef, which they prefer, though why I could never discover, for the meat‘of 
the reindeer is much more delicate and tender, and has a peculiarly delicious 
flavor, probably derived from the fragrant moss that constitutes its food. It is 
cheap enough to satisfy the most economical housekeeper, a fine fat buck, entire, 
costing at Nishne Kolymsk only 3 rubles, that is $1.50, and at Sradnia 5 rubles. 
The meat of the reindeer is always excellent, while the beef is more expensive, and 
a only aa in price by the horse, which is a luxury only to be indulged iz by 
the rich.” 
Tam in full sympathy with all these requests for the distribution of reindeer in 
widely separated sections of Alaska. The more widely they are distributed and 
the larger the number of interests that are subserved by them the greater good will 
be accomplished and the larger the constituency of those who will take an interest 
in this new industry. 
The vast territory of central and arctic Alaska, unfitted for agriculture or cattle  
-P-A-G-E-498
    1456 . EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
raising, is abundantly supplied with the long, fibrous white moss, the natural food 
of the reindeer. Taking the statistics of Norway and Sweden as a guide, arctic 
and subarctic Alaska can support 9,000,000 reindeer, furnishing a supply of food, 
clothing, and means of transportation to a population of a quarter of a million. 
Providence has adapted the reindeer to the peculiar conditions of arctic life, and 
it furnishes the possibilities of large and increasing commercial industries. The 
flesh is considered a great delicacy, whether fresh or cured. The untanned skin 
makes the best clothing for the climate of Alaska, and when tanned is the best 
leather for the bookbinder, upholsterer, and glove maker. The hair is in great 
demand, by reason of its wonderful buoyancy, in the construction of life-saving 
apparatus. The horns and hoofs make the best glue known to commerce. With 
Alaska stocked with this valuable animal, the hardy Eskimo and the enterprising 
American would develop industries in the lines indicated that would amount to 
millions of dollars annually, and all this in a region where such industries are 
only developed enough to suggest their great. possibilities. 
The terms for which the Lapps contracted to serve the United States has expired. 
They have so fully proved. their efficiency, justified their employment, and made 
themselves so necessary that their services can not be dispensed with without 
injury. An effort is being made to induce them to remain in the country longer, 
and there is a reasonable prospect that, after returning to their native land, they 
will close out their business affairs and return to Alaska as permanent settlers. 
If a few additional families of Lapps can be encouraged to accompany them, it 
will be a great boon to the rising reindeer industry. 
Reindeer Lapps are of two classes—one who give their entire attention to the . 
raising of reindeer, and the other who give their whole attention to freighting and 
transportation. The latter class inthe old country seldom raise the reindeer 
which they own, but are accustomed to purchase from the breeder, then train and 
use entirely for freighting. We are very fortunate in having both classes among 
the seven Lapp men in Alaska. Two of the seven are trained freighters, and it is 
proposed to allow them this coming season to go to the mines and demonstrate 
the usefulness of the reindeer in that region for transporting freight and furnish- 
ing rapid communication for passengers and mail. With the introduction of a 
larger number of deer, suitable for freighting purposes, it will be necessary to 
secure a larger number of experienced Lapps from the old country, as it will take 
a series of years before the natives can be so far trained that they can be trusted 
to freight on their own account. 
At the request of this office, through the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary 
of State has communicated with his Imperial Majesty the Czar of Russia, request- 
ing permission for this office to place a purchasing agent, with one or two herds- 
men, at Some suitable point on the coast of Siberia adjacent to Alaska. 
At the request of the Department of the Interior in 1892, permission to purchase 
reindeer on the Siberian coast was obtained through his excellency the Russian 
minister resident at this capital. But experience has shown that unless the deer 
are purchased beforehand and collected at one point on the coast, the United States 
steamer is delayed too long in the process of effecting these preliminaries, and the 
consequence is that the short season in which the transportation of reindeer is 
possible in these northern seas passes away with slender results. The average 
purchase has been considerably less than 150 reindeer per annum during the past 
four years. It will be easy to double the number annually, provided the pur- 
» chasing and collecting of deer can be performed by some party in advance. 
The scarcity of food in places continues periodic, and much suffering, with loss 
of life, must ensue while the present slow process of introducing a new food sup- 
ply into the country continues. Missionaries of all churches on the ground unite 
in testifying to the need of more speed. 
A few years of larger appropriations on the part of Congress would purchase 
and place in Alaska two herds of 5,000 each, the natural increase of which would 
perpetuate and extend the stock until the whole country is covered. 
THE ITINERARY. 
Leaving Washington on May 14, 1896, for my annual inspection of the schools 
and reindeer stations in Alaska, Seattle was reached on the 29th of the same 
month. The following two days, exclusive of an intervening Sabbath, were spent 
in looking after the procuring and shipment of supplies for the various schools, 
and on June 2 I.took the steamship City of Topeka for Sitka, visiting en route the 
schools at Fort Wrangel, Juneau, and Douglas Island, reaching Sitka on the 8th 
of June. Five very busy days were given to the several schools at Sitka. Through 
the courtesy of Capt. C. L, Hooper, commanding the Bering Sea fleet, arrange-
-P-A-G-E-499

ments were made by which I was allowed to take passage on board the United 
States revenue cutter Bear. 
On the morning of June 13 I went on board the Bear, which got under way at 
ten minutes after 11 o’clock a. m., and proceeded out to sea bound for Bering Sea 
and the Arctic Ocean. The seven-day voyage to Unalaska was unusually pleas- 
ant—the sea was smooth, the wind favorable, and we made a quick trip. Through 
the whole trip I found the officers both obliging and companionable. 
The ship’s roster reads: Francis Tuttle, captain; David H. Jarvis, first lieuten- 
ant and executive; Claude §. Cochran, second lieutenant; William E. W. Hall, 
second lieutenant; H. G. Hamlet, third lieutenant; Charles S. Coffin, chief engi- 
neer; Harry U. Butler, first assistant engineer; Henry K. Spencer, second assistant 
engineer; Robert Lyall, surgeon. 
In the early morning of the 18th, meeting the revenue cutter Rush, bound for 
Sitka, we availed ourselves of the opportunity of sending back letters to friends 
in the States. At 10.20 a.m. of the same date we dropped anchor in Delaroff 
Harbor (Unga). Going ashore, I had an opportunity to visit the schoolhouse and 
teacher’s family; also to meet some of thespupils. The teacher had taken a sailing 
vessel to Puget Sound for his vacation. While at anchor the Alaska Commercial 
Company’s steamship Bertha arrived from San Francisco laden with supplies for 
various trading and mission stations, and among thespassengers were a number 
of missionaries, At noon we were again under way, calling at Sand Point for 
about an hour. Leaving Sand Point and passing through Popoff Strait, we were 
in sight of Pavloff Volcano, which was vigorously throwing out huge pufis of 
black smoke from its crater. 
At noon on June 19 we steamed through Unimak Pass into Bering Sea. 
That afternoon, sweeping rapidly by the head of Akun Island, we were soon off 
the north point of Akutan Island. orizontal bands of red rock alternating with 
yellow and green rings, bright in the rays of the pene sun, gave a foreground 
of wondrous beauty. In the background towered Akutan Volcano, its sides 
covered with snow, portions of which were discolored and shaded by a recent 
jhower of ashes. Occasional puffs of light, vapory smoke arose from the crater 
nd slowly rolled off into space. At the western end of the island -a remarkable 
illar of rock, with perpendicular sides and level top, arises out of the sea, while, 
o complete the marvelous picture, on the east a cloud of fog was seen rolling over 
high ridge and down the precipitous sides of a mountain, giving it the appear- 
nce of a vast cataract—a score of Niagaras united in one. It was a scene of a 
ifetime and never to be forgotten. 
At 11.20 p.m. of the 19th we dropped anchor in Dutch Harbor. It was the first 
ime during fourteen trips that I was permitted to reach Unalaska without being 
easick. Ten days were spent at Unalaska and Dutch Harbor in looking after and 
rranging for the educational work at Unalaska, and also the several points on 
fhe coast of Bering Sea and the interior of Alaska. The next day the steamship 
ertha arrived from San Francisco having the following persons on board: Rev. 
nd Mrs. H. A. Naylor, Rey. Frederick F. Flewelling, of the Church of England, 
n route for the Church of England’s missions on the head waters of the Yukon 
iver, a distance from their English home of about 11,200 miles; the Rey. 8. H. 
ock, and Dr. and Mrs. J. H. Romig, of the Moravian Church; the former was 
n route to Carmel, on the Nushagak River, and the latter to establish medical 
nissions on the Kuskokwim River; the Rev. Paschal Tosi, vicar apostolic; the 
ey. James M. Cataldo and Brother Pietro Branesli, of the Roman Catholic Church, 
m route to their missions upon the Yukon River; the Rey. and Mrs. Jacob Kortch- 
sky, of the Russo-Greek Church, en route to their mission at St. Michael. 
Attracted by the herring or other small fish, the harbor was full of whales, a 
zen of which played around the ship and could easily have been shot from the 
eck, 
On June 24 we escorted to the steamship Homer Prof. and Mrs. John A. Tuck, 
ho were leaving Unalaska to return to the States. A large number of friends, 
hom they had made among the natives, were also at the wharf to bid them god- 
eed. They have done faithful, efficient, and self-denying work during the seven 
ears they have labored in Unalaska. 
The Methodist Episcopal missionaries at Unalaska took the occasion of the pres- 
mce of so many missionaries and teachers to. give their own school a picnic, to 
hich all the visiting missionaries were invited. This was held on a mountain 
de on the afternoon of the 26th, and was a very enjoyable occasion. 
On the 29th, by direction of the Secretary of the Interior, with the assistance 
f sailors furnished by Capt. Francis Tuttle, commanding the revenue cutter 
ear, I selected and marked out the land necessary for Government school and 
ission purposes in the proposed town site of Unalaska.

On June 30, the revenue cutter Rush having arrived from Sitka with mail for 
the fleet, at 9.50 p. m. the cutter Bear got under way for St. Lawrence Island, the 
reindeer station, and other points in Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean. 
On July 3,.at 2.30 o’clock p.m., we met our first ice, in latitude 59° 51’ 15" and 
longitude 170° 9'55". Keeping off about 2 miles from the ice, we steamed parallel 
with it for the next 100 miles. It was a part of a large ice floe that extended from 
St. Matthew Island across Bering Sea to Nunivak Island. That night we passed 
through considerable ice drift, being spurs from the main floe. 
On July 4, in the midst of a dense fog somewhere off the south end of St. Law: 
rence Island, the ship was decorated with flags, and at noon a salute of 21 guns 
was fired. Working the ship slowly through a dense fog and broken ice during 
the night and the next forenoon, we reached aiid came to anchor off the village at 
the extreme northwest corner of St. Lawrence Island. 
Soon our ship was surrounded with boat loads of natives, and among them came 
Mr. Gambell, the teacher at that island, receiving his annual mail (for this is one 
of the several stations in northern Alaska that has but one mail a year). I went 
ashore with him to inspect the station and school. My stay on shore; however 
was cut short by the surf commencing to rise and threatening to prevent mj 
return to the ship. All haste was made to reach the ship, which was already 
under the influence of the storm, dragging her anchor. The anchor being lifted 
the ship’s station was changed to the south side of the point, but that anchorage 
was very little better. _ In the meantime the sea had become so rough that it was 
with great difficulty the natives who had returned me to the ship were abl 
themselves to make a landing through the surf. After watching them safely on 
shore, at 10.20 p.m. we got under way and steamed out tosea. Thenext morning 
steaming through a large field of floating ice, we came to anchor at 6.35 a. m. of 
the village of Indian Point, Cape Tchaplin, Siberia. As usual upon the arrival o! 
a vessel, the deck of the cutter was soon crowded with natives, some endeavorins 
to barter reindeer skins, furs, and curios, and others desiring to see the ship’ 
surgeon. 
The annual cruise of the revenue cutter along that northern coast offers thé 
natives the only opportunity during the year of the advice of an educated physi 
cian; consequently, whenever the ship drops anchor all the sick and ailing that ar 
able to be moved are gathered up from the village and neighborhood and brough’ 
on board the ship to see the doctor. Those who are unable to be moved are usu 
ally afterwards visited in their huts on shore, and everything possible done fo: 
their help and relief. For the time being the ship becomes a traveling hospita 
and dispensary. During our stay the captain and a number of the officers accom 
panied the surgeon on shore. At 4.05 p.m. we were again under way, steamins 
through a field of drift ice that seemed to be running out of the bays north of thi 
point. As we are in north latitude, where at this season of the year there is n¢ 
night, it makes but little difference whether we are steaming or lying at ancho: 
during the night. We rise by the watch and retire in the same way, the sur 
shining both when we go to bed and when we wake up. 
On July 7, at 3 o’clock in the morning, we reached and anchored off South Head 
St. Lawrence Bay, Siberia, and several boat loads of Tchuctchees came to the ship 
This is one of the best points for procuring reindeer on the Siberian coast, and her 
we secured in former years the greatest number; but this season, as the Bear coul 
not be spared for the purpose of transporting deer, we were compelled fo notif; 
the deer men that ether vessels were coming later in ‘the season for their dee: 
However, through a combination of circumstances, no ships went for the deer 
greatly to our disappointment and that of the people. 
In an hour we were again under way. Passing to the north of the point, sev 
eral large umiak loads of natives were seen coming out to sea to meet us, and thy 
engine was stopped to allow them to come on board. The same message concern 
ing the purchase of reindeer was communicated to them. At 5.40 a.m, we wer 
again under way, headed for the reindeer station at Port Clarence, which we co: 
fidently expected to reach that evening (alas for human confidence, it was ninetee: 
days before we finally reached that station). But at 1.20 p. m. we got into the ic 
and had to slow down speed. To add to our troubles so dense a fog set in that w 
could scarcely see the length of the ship. Two or three times during the nigh 
the engine was stopped until the fog should lighten up a little—occasional glimps: 
only revealed heavy ice allaround us. After a night of great anxiety, the captai: 
anchored at sea the next morning at7.30. At 9.50 a. m. the fog lifted a little, ti 
anchor was hoisted, and another attempt made to work through the ice and g 
into Port Clarence. At 3p. m. the fog again lifted a little, and from the crow’ 
nest at the masthead it was seen that the ice was densely packed all the wa, 
_ across from Cape York to Cape Douglas, that the original ice of the previou|

winter was still unbroken in Port Clarence, and heavy ice floes were packed 
together from the entrance of Port Clarence 8 miles out to sea. 3 
Realizing the impossibility of making any progress toward land, the captain 
determined to run down to King Island and land a family of natives belonging 
to that place that he brought over from Siberia. Upon approaching the island he 
‘was surprised to find at anchor under the lee of the land the steam whalers Orca, 
Thrasher, and Narwhal, the whaling schooner Rosario, and the coal bark J. P. 
Peters. A heavy fog enveloped the island. Anchor was dropped in the midst of 
the whaling fleet at 7.20 p.m, The whalers, unable to get into Port Clarence 
(the first time in fifty years at this season of the year), had taken refuge in the 
ee of King Island and were coaling ship. That night, a storm arising, two of 
the whalers lost their anchors and were compelled to put to sea to save going on 
the recks. While lying at anchor at King Island, in company with Captain Tut- 
le, I called upon the several captains of the whaling fieet. Captain Smith, who 
had wintered at Herschel Island, narrated an incident where the children of an 
1d man, being tired of caring for him, had removed all their belongings and pro- 
visions from the hut, leaving their old father to starve or freeze to death. The 
ailors, learning the situation, kept the old man supplied with provisions through 
he winter, and the following spring he died from. natural causes. Among the 
‘ild Eskimos of the Arctic, both on the Alaskan and the Siberian coasts, it is con- 
idered a kindness and neighborly act to kill an old person, or one that is chronic- 
ly sick without prospect of ever being well again. 
While Captain Smith was on the coast of Siberia, a native who had made up his 
ind to change his residence to another section of the country had an invalid 
aughter who, with their appliances, could not be moved. Instead of remaining 
n his old home and caring for that daughter, he and his sons packed up all the 
amily belongings and supplies on their dog sleds, hitched up their dog teams, and 
when everything was ready for a start, they went into the hut and stabbed the 
aughter to death. Atthe island where we were anchored, a few weeks before our 
rrival, a man who had been sick a long while adjusted a cord around his own 
eck and then asked his neighbors to pull him up until he was strangled to death; 
oe pried to die, and, as good neighbors, they assisted him in accomplishing his 
ish. 
On July 10, the weather having somewhat cleared, a large number of King 
slanders came on board. They crawled down the precipitous sides of their island 
ome to the water’s edge like so many ants, and launching their one-hole bidarkas 
hrough the surf came off to the-ship in droyes. During the day, on hearing a 
eport that the teacher at Cape Prince of Wales had had some trouble with the 
tives, and as we had his yearly mail on board, Captain Tuttle concluded to 
ake an attempt to reach him, and at 10.45 got under way. Upon coming within 
ight of the place, at 3.15 p. m., a large ice floe was found moving against the vil- 
lage, making it impossible toland. Nothing could be done but turn and steam 
‘or another anchorage. 
The ice still blocking up the entrance to Port Clarence, the ship was headed for 
t. Michael, and we found to our regret that the immense ice floe, which we had 
een in vain attempting to penetrate in order to get to the Teller Reindeer Station, 
xtended all the way down the coast to Cape Nome, a distance of 180 miles, so that 
m going to St. Michael the ship was forced by the ice floe 50 miles south of its true 
ourse. There was, however, a good providence in this, as it led the captain to 
nd the brig Geneva dangerously situated in the ice and to tow it safely into St. 
ichael. On the morning of the 22d of June the steamer Bertha had taken the 
eneva in tow for St. Michael, a trip of five or six days. But after battling for 
early three weeks with the ice the captain left the schooner at sea until the steam- 
hip could force her way through the ice to St. Michael, unload, and then return 
lor the schooner. However, providentially for the schooner, she did not have to 
ait, but was picked up and towed to a place of safety before being crushed. 
All through July 11 and 12 our steamer kept along the edge of the great ice floe, 
e weather thick with fogs and snow squalls until the latter part of the aftcrnoon 
£ the 12th, when the snow squalls were succeeded by a drizzling rain. At 10.10 
.m. we anchored off St. Michael. Going ashore on the forenoon of the 13th, we 
und mosquitoes in swarms. 
July 15 Captain Tuttle took the Bear up the coast to enable me to visit the school 
md Swedish mission at Unalaklik. In previous years, when requesting to visit 
he place, I had been told that the water was too shallow for an ocean steamer. 
pon making the attempt, however, we found no special difficulty; the day was 
erfect, bright, sunshiny, no wind, smooth water. The captain had invited a 
lect company from St. Michael to accompany us. At 2.50 p. m., anchoring off 
e village, Lieutenant Jarvis took the party in the steam launch close to the shore,

      where we were transferred to rowboats to make alanding. Although it was vaca- 
tion time, the school bell was rung and the children called in that I might have 
an opportunity of seeing them at work. The mosquitoes, however, were so bad 
that the visiting party became anxious to get off shore, and I did not have asmuch 
time as I would have liked. Returning to the ship, we hoisted anchor and sailed 
for St. Michael, which we reached at 1.50 the following morning. 
In the harbor at St. Michael we found the Yukon River steamer Portus B. 
Weare, the ocean steamer Bertha and bark Geneva, of San Francisco, and the 
small steamers William Seward, Explorer, Koyuk, and Yukon, and the schooner- 
rigged yawl Edith. 
On July 21 the American brigantine C. C. Funk arrived from San Francisco and| 
the steamer Arctic came down the Yukon. Among the passengers on the Arctic 
were Rey. and Mrs. T. H. Canham, Miss Macdonald, and Mrs. Bishop Bompas, all 
of the Church of England missions; Dr. Glenton, of the American Episcopal 
mission; Mr. and Mrs. Harper, from the Pelly River Trading Station, and Mr. 
William A. Beddoe, of Chicago, contractor for the mail route between Juneau 
and Circle City; Mr. Omer Maris, correspondent of the Chicago Record, and Mr. 
H. De Windt, correspondent of the Pall Mall Gazette, London. The cutter Bear 
had instructions to convey the latter to Siberia, where he proposed making a lan 
journey across to Europe. I have since learned that his plan miscarried, and hi 
came down later in the fall on a whaler to San Francisco, returning to Europ 
across the United States and the Atlantic instead of across Siberia. It was reporte 
so healthy in the Upper Yukon Valley, just below the Arctic Circle, that althoug! 
white women have been in that section for fifty years as wives of missionaries an: 
fur traders, only one had died during that time in the district—Mrs. Bell, wife o: 
Captain Bell, of Fort Simpson, on the McKenzie River. Such an unusual occur: 
rence caused much comment among the people. 
The missionaries reported that the gold mining at Circle City was making rapi 
progress. During the present season both the Protestant Episcopal and the Roma: 
Catholic churches have established missions at that piace and proposed hospitals} 
Last winter the first public school ever held in Circle City was established by thi 
miners and taught by a volunteer teacher, Mrs. Dr. Yates. The school laste

pleted two-story building, sold for $7,000 in gold. Half the buildings in the plac 
are saloons, and liquor costs 50 centsa drink. Last winter the place containe 
560 white inhabitants; this summer, 1,150, of whom 200 are permanent resident: 
in the village and the others scattered among the adjacent mines. There are abou 
40 white women in the district. Last winter the thermometer registered at 5 p. m. 
66° below zero for three weeks at a time. During the entire month of Januar 
the average temperature was 46° to 48° below zero. At Mastodon mines the ther.

During the evening of July 22 the steamship Bertha sailed for San Francise 
with 125 passengers and a mail to ourfriends. Learning that the Swedish missio: 
at Golovin Bay was out of food, Captain Tuttle very kindly offered to go to thei: 
relief, and I at once made arrangements with the Rev. A. E. Karlsen, Swedis' 
missionary at Unalaklik, who is in charge of their stations, to procure the neces

wy supplies for the relief of the station at Golovin Bay. While I was on shore 
aking these arrangements, the steamship Portland arrived from Seattle with a 
ter mail and newspapers. She also brought lumber and workmen for the con- 
ruction of a river steamer for the North American Trading Company. The 
laska Commercial Company are also building a new river steamer and some 
ge barges. 
The ev clocinant of the Yukon gold mines is greatly stimulating trade through 
1 this country. 
Having received on board the supplies for the relief of the Swedish station, we 
oisted anchor at 9.55 p.m. and put tosea. At 7.10 the following morning we 
ere at the entrance of Golovin Bay, but a gale having arisen, the sea was too 
ugh to land stores, and as there was no sheltered anchorage we were compelled 
zain to go out to sea, where we hove to, riding out the storm—a most miserable 
ay. 
On the morning of the 25th we again skirted the bay and were able to make an, 
atrance, dropping anchor at 6.40a.m. Upon the slope of the west bank of the 
ay the reindeer herd was clearly visible from the ship; also the native village on 
1e end of the eastern spit. Having finished breakfast, at 8.15 a.m. Dr. Lyall, the 
hysician, and myself were sent to the village in a boat in charge of Lieutenant 
lamlet. A fair wind made it a pleasant sail. On our way we were met by Mr. 
fultberg, the missionary, and Mr. Dexter, the trader, coming to the ship. They 
ere taken aboard our boat and returned with us to the village, where they tried 
) engage all the natives with their umiaks and send them off to the ship to bring 
1 the stores and supplies. Some friction having arisen between the trader and 
1e mission with regard to the location of the mission buildings, I staked off a plat 
f vacant ground around the mission buildings, having first informed Mr. Dexter, 
1e trader, and invited him to accompany and counsel with me. As some of the 
sindeer apprentices have tried to dispose of their private deer to the trader, I left 
im a formal notification that they were not allowed to sell. While we were on 
nore the wind freshened, and we found it rough and dangerous getting back to 
ae ship. Many natives who had started out in their umiaks had returned to the 
each, being unwilling to venture in the rough sea. When we reached the ship, 
t1p.m., the captain got under way and moved in to the western shore, some- 
rhat sheltered from the wind and the waves. From our new anchorage the sup- 
lies were speedily landed, and as the storm was still heavy and our anchorage in 
he open roadstead insecure, the ship got under way at 4.43 p. m. and stood out 
sea. 
On Sunday evening, July 26, at 8.85 p.m., we dropped anchor at Port Clarence, 
ar the mouth of which we had been over two weeks before. At anchor in the 
rbor was the schooner Jda Schnauer, of San Francisco, Captain Neilsen in com- 
and; also the whaling schooners Bonanza and Rosario. The schooner Ida 
hnauer had on board the supplies for the reindeer station and several of the 
hools and missions, together with Mr. Lopp and family, who were returning to 
eir stations at Bering Straits, and Mr. Kjellmann of the reindeer station. Soon 
‘ter dropping anchor Mr. Lopp came on board and remained until midnight. 
At 8.40 a. m. on the 27th the Bear got under way and moved up to the Teller 
eindeer Station, where supplies, barter goods, and mail were sent on shore, after 
hich, at 11.35 a. m., anchor was hoisted, and we crossed to the south side of the 
y to the watering station near Cape Riley. While the ship was absent watering 
remained at the reindeer station, and with Mr. Widstead took an inventory of 
e public property. At 11.15 a.m. the schooner Ida Schnauer anchored off the 
ation Baa commenced discharging freight. We all worked far into the night. 
s the year before the brig W. H. Meyer, that had on board the supplies for the 
‘issions and schools, was forced ashore and wrecked in front.of the reindeer sta- 
n (the natives claiming through the power of their medicine man), the Eskimos 
ade the night hideous by their drums and howlings as they tried to invoke 
other storm and secure the wreck of the present vessel. 
The next day was indeed stormy, with a very heavy surf, but the schooner did not 
me ashore; she, however, was unable to land any freight at that time, and found 
necessary to go into deeper water. Having finished the inventory and looked 
er the station, I appointed Mr. William A. Kjellmann superintendent in the 
lace of Mr. J. C. Widstead, removed. As the storm kept up all day, preventing 
e landing of any supplies, various conferences were held with different employ- 
is, and the work of the station mapped out for the coming year. The storm that 
evented the landing of supplies also prevented the return of the cutter, and as 
ie employees at the station had no extra furniture and did not suppose that they 
eded to make any provision for visitors at that station, with one communication 
ith the world a year, the physician and myself had to sleep on the floor in the

drag room. The employees, however, did the very best they could to make u 
comfortable. 
On the 29th, the sea being still rough, no goods were landed, but at 3.55 p. n 
the Bear returned and anchored off the station, allowing us to return to ou 
quarters on ship. As Captain Tuttle was anxious to start northward, I returne 
on shore and worked until late in the night closing accounts with Mr. Widstea 
and the Lapps. The surf was so rough that but for the hull of the wrecked Meye 
making a shelter I would not have been able to have got through and returned o 
board ship. Early in the morning Mr. David Johnson, a Swedish missionary fror 
Unalaklik, and his native assistant came on board by permission of the captain t 
go to Kotzebue Sound, where they hoped to be able to establish a new missior 
Two of the Eskimo apprentices, Ahlook and Electoona, were taken on board fc 
a visit to their relatives at Point Hope. At 6.10 a. m., July 30, the ship was unde 
way, stopping a few moments as we passed out of Port Clarence to communicat 
with the schooner Bonanza. At 2.40 p.m. we were steaming by the village « 
Cape Prince of Wales, but as there was too much surf for landing we passed ox 
entering the Arctic Ocean with pleasant weather. 
July 31, while skirting the Alaska coast north of Bering Straits, the ship a1 
chored at 10.25 a. m. to allow some natives to come on board for medical attentio1 
At 6.15 p.m. resumed our trip; during the night, reaching drift ice, anchor we 
dropped at 11.10 p.m. All night heavy drift ice surrounded the vessel. 
At 6.35 a. m., August 1, starting up the engines, the ship worked its way throug 
heavy ice until 8.30a.m., when we anchored off Cape Blossom, in Kotzebue Sounc 
Soon several boat loads of natives came on board, among them being the uncle ¢ 
Mr. Johnson’s interpreter. During the day, the storm increasing, the native 
were unable to leave the ship. In the afternoon and evening the rain and sleet ¢ 
the morning turned to snow and continued during the night. The drift ic 
which was scouring the sides of the vessel, increasing in volume, making it dat 
gerous to remain longer, and the storm of the previous day having somewhé 
abated, about 6 o’clock in the morning of August 2 the natives started for shor 
accompanied by Mr. David Johnson and his native assistant of the Swedish Eva1 
gelical Union Mission Society. Mr. Johnson was landed among these wild peop. 
without a house to shelter him, without anything to build a house from, with n 
protection of courts, policemen, or government within 1,000 miles, with nothin 
but afew pounds of provisions for the winter, throwing himself upon the ba: 
barous people among whom he expected to work. His strong, heroic faith mad 
an impression upon the officers and crew of the ship. The natives having left, <

On Monday morning at 6.30 the officer on deck discovered a brig ashore. A 
7.10 a.m. we passed Cape Thompson, and at 9.15 a. m. we were abreast of th 
wrecked bark, which was found to be the whaler Hidalgo, Capt. C. A. Giffor 
master. An officer was sent ashore and soon returned, reporting the vessel a con 
plete wreck and abandoned, the crew being quartered at one of the whaling sti 
tions south of Point Hope. At 10.25 a. m. the ship steamed ahead, and at 11.1 
anchored off one of the whaling stations, 7 miles below Point Hope, to commun 
cate with the wrecked crew. Various parties, whalers and natives, were soon 0 
board. At1 p.m. anchor was hoisted and we steamed around to the north si¢ 
of the spit, and at 2.45 p.m. anchored off the village of Point Hope. In the harbc 
were the whaling schooner Rosario and the bark Mermaid. The captain kindl 
sent the physician and myself immediately ashore with the annual mail for th 
Episcopal mission station. The grounded ice made it very difficult and dangerot 
landing. We were able, however, to reach the beach at the lower end of the vi 
lage, and then had a long, hot walk to the mission. As Dr. Driggs, the missionary 
had been home from the States but a few days, we did not remain long. Durin 
the afternoon Captain Gifford, of the wrecked whaler, came on board the Bea 
and asked passage to Unalaska, which was granted him. Having transacted tl 
necessary business at Point Hope, at 5.385 p.m. the anchor was hoisted and tk 
ship passed around to the whaling station on the south side of the spit, where w 
anchored at 7.15 p.m., to enable Captain Gifford to secure and bring on board h 
personal effects. Having completed his arrangements and returned on board wit 
his things, at 9.30 p. m. the Bear got under way for the far north. 
All night long we steamed through floating ice, encountering light hail and rai 
storms. At7a.m., August 4, passed Cape Lisbourne, distant 5 miles. At 8.15 tk 
ice, which had been light, became very heavy, and at 9.35 a. m., unable to procee 
farther on account of the ice, we came to anchor off Point Lay. 
August 5 another attempt was made to get northward. Getting under way ¢ 
2.40 a. m., we steamed for some distance along the edge of the ice, but by 4.1 
os

_m. found that we were in the midst of heavy drift ice. At 8.15, the ice becom- 
ig too heavy for progress or for safety, we came to anchor under Icy Cape. At 
oon, the ice floe closing in upon us, the ship got under way and proceeded slowly 
rough heavy ice floes and thick fog southward until, finding comparatively open 
ater near Cape Lay, it came to anchor at 5.55 p.m., the current setting strongly 
» the north. The next day we made our third attempt to get north, hoisting 
nchor at 2.40 a. m., but by 4.45 a.m. were again in the heavy ice, and at 7.56 
.m. were compelled to anchor on the south side of Icy Cape, the great ice floe 
rming a solid wall in front of us. Soon after’some natives came on board and 
sported the ocean closed with ice up to Point Barrow. The drift ice again clos- 
1g in upon us, at 6.20 p.m. the anchor was hoisted and we were compelled to 
eam to the southward through heavy ice until 8.55 p. m., when we were able to 
nchor in clear water off Point Lay, near which we found already anchored the 
haling barks Horatio, Captain Slocum commanding, and the Alice Knowles, 
aptain Ogden commanding. 
During the night conferences of the captains were held, and Captain Gifford of 
1e wrecked Hidalgo joined the bark Horatio as mate. As Sisyphus rolled his 
one up the hill only to find it at the bottom the next day, the same toil to be 
peated day after day, so every morning the cutter Bear, pushing for the north, 
ould get fast in the ice and be compelled to return again to the south in the 
fternoon. Thus on the 7th of August, at 5.35 a. m., the anchor was hoisted and 
other attempt made to get north. This time the captain concluded to steam 
uthward and westward around and through the southern edge of the great ice 
, hoping to find open water outside to the westward. Passing north along the 
est, edge of the ice floo we steamed through floating ice until 10.10 p. m., when 
© ice became too heavy to make further progress, and we ‘repeated our daily 
perience of steaming southward until 11.30 p. m., when the propeller was 
lopped and the vessel allowed to drift with the ice. At 3,15 on the morning of 
ugust 8, the fog lifting, Point Belcher was seen about 15 miles away and we 
und that we had drifted northward during the night at the rate of 2 miles per 
ar. The weather clearing somewhat at 3.30 a. m., we again steamed northward 
rough the ice. At 7the masts of some whalers were seen to the north of us, and 
on after the mission buildings and whaling station at Point Barrow were sighted 
rough the field glasses. Everyone was now in high glee, as we would soon be 
ere, and, after discharging our duties at that place, would be able to face south- 
rd and homeward, 
At 10 a.m. we were opposite the station, where some of the whalers had suc- 
eded in getting in, when the ice had closed in upon them, and they were pris- 
ers. But the opening that.had let them in had, before our arrival, closed with 
, Which stood a solid, impenetrable wall to bar any further progress on our 
rt. We had got our mail out, our clean clothes on, in expectation of going 
ore and seeing friends; but, alas, we could not get ashore; we could not even 
ain where we were, and nothing was left to do but to turn and steam south- 
rd to open water, which we did until 1.45 the next morning, when the engine 
stopped, and, it being too deep to anchor, the vessel was allowed to drift. To 
7 astonishment, when the thick fog and rainy night had passed, we found that 
were back opposite Point Barrow, Having during the night drifted northward 
ith the ice. Again we steamed through the drift ice along the edge of the main 
, looking for some channel through which we could force our way in and 
ch the station, but in vain; and again at 2 p.m. we turned southward and 
st, steaming through heavy ice until midnight, when the engine was stopped 
|d, as usual, the vessel allowed to drift. 
ugust 10, at 5a. m., the ship resumed her usual practice of bumping ice and 
cing her way within sight of the desired haven, and then turning away and 
aming southward, until 6.20 p. m., when we came up with the whaling barks 
ratio, Mermaid, and Alice Knowles. The three captains soon came aboard to 
nd the evening, while the four vessels drifted around the sea. At 11.20 p.m. 
. John Wells, mate of the wrecked brig Hidalgo, was taken on board the cutter 
ar for transportation tc Unalaska, provided we ever got out of the ice. The 
levious night having been spent as usual in drifting in the fog and the ice, at 
5 a.m. August 11 some of the officers went in the second cutter to shoot walrus 
covered asleep on the ice. They claimed to haye shot three, but none were 
aught back to the ship. In the afternoon the officer of the crow’s-nest having 
‘covered some open water inshore, the vessel was forced through the heavy ice 
til the open water was reached, and at 3.40 p.m. the ship was anchored off 
all Cliff. Heavy drift ice was floating by us all night to the northward. On 
gust 12, at 8.40 a. m., we started northward, reaching heavy ice at 10.07, anda 
tmainutes afterwards, came toanchor, unable to proceed. At 12.40, discovering

asmall lead in the ice, we were again under way, and at 2p. m. anchored nea 
Refuge Inlet. The day was stormy, raining and snowing by turns. The ice con 
ing in too heavy for safety, at 10.55 p.m. the anchor was again hoisted and w 
turned southward, steaming for a safer location. Finally, at 11.10 p. m., the shi 
was fastened to the lee side of a large berg of grounded ice, where we lay ver 
securely until the next day. 
At noon August 13 an officer reported that he thought the vessel could ge 
through the ice to Point Barrow. At 1.20 p.m. the moorings of the ship were cas 
off from the grounded ice and we commenced picking our way northward throug 
the heavy ice with blinding flurries of snow and squalls of rain. This time (th 
ninth attempt) we made it, and at 4.25 p. m. the ship was secured to a grounde 
iceberg off Point Barrow Refuge Station. The berg was probably 6 miles lon 
with an average breadth of half a mile; in places it was from 50 to 75 feet hig 
above the water and went down under the water to the bottom of the sea. Thi 
great berg had come in from the sea eleven months before and had remained unt 
our visit, the middle of August, and perhaps is still there. We found that the pas 
winter had been an exceptionally severe one. On the 20th of December the the: 
mometer registered 40° below zero and remained steadily below zero until the mic 
dle of May. During an ordinary winter at that point there are mild spells ¢ 
weather, but last winter was very cold. The warmest weather during Februar 
was 38° below zero and the coldest 66° below. The average temperature for th 
month was 45° below. Theextreme cold lasted through the winter until the 20t 
of April, when it was 37° below zero. From that time on the weather continue 
to moderate until the middle of May, when the thermometer marked zero. Sno 
did not leave the ground until the 19th of July, and on the fresh-water lakes ic 
remained until the middle of August, a month later than usual. Spring plowin 
and gardening had not yet commenced at the time of our visit, the middle « 
August. The long summer day commenced on the 10th of May and lasted unt 
the 4th of August. The long winter nights will commence the 19th of Novembe 
and last until the 238d day of January. 
Soon after making the ship fast to the ice, Mr. John W. Kelly, manager of t 
Pacific Steam Whaling Company’s station, and Mr. Charles Brower, of the Lieb 
Station, Mr. L. M. Stevenson, teacher and missionary, and Captain Aiken, supe} 
intendent of the Government Refuge Station, with others, came on board. 
portion of the ice which had blocked the entrance to the roadstead had that mor: 
ing moved to the northward, making a channel for our entrance. After dinner 
accompanied Captain Tuttle on shore and_ made calls at the Government Refu; 
Station and the Presbyterian mission. When I left Washington in May it w 
with the understanding on the part of the Presbyterian Missionary Society th: 
their station at Point Barrow would be closed until a suitable man and his wi: 
could be found for the work, as it had been found necessary for Mr. Stevenson 
return to his family in Ohio. But as the Government had ordered the refu:      
         
    
           
       
     
      
          
   crackers, and 16 sacks of flour, which were to be replaced by the mission socie' 
when the ship reached Unalaska. Other supplies for the mission were secur 
from the wardroom mess and the whaling station on shore, and Mr, Stevenson h: 
remained at his difficult post another year. 
To expedite the work of turning the Government station over to the whalii 
station, Lieutenant Jarvis, with two sailors, were sent on shore. As time wi 
precious and our stay, on account of the ice at Point Barrow, uncertain, I aga} 
went ashore on the 15th, immediately after breakfast, and remained all day, loo} 
ing after various matters connected with the school and mission at that northe: 
most station. Oozhaloo, one of the wealthiest and most active Eskimos of ti 
settlement, made application to be taken with his family to the reindeer statio| 
where he desired to become an apprentice and learn the management and care 
domestic reindeer. His application was an evidence of his ability and farsight 
ness. - When a boy, if hungry, he could get into a kiak and go out and cluba s 
on the head in front of his home; now seals have become so scarce that but fi 
are secured even with guns. When he was a boy, whales were always found 
the waters adjacent to his home; they remained there during the entire season 
open water; now the few whales that are seen at all scurry past the village as 
conscious that bomb guns were waiting to take their lives, and it is but rare 
the natives get them. When he was a boy, if he wanted a change in his diet fr 
whale blubber and seal meat, he could go just back of the village and shoot a d 
with his arrow; now he finds it necessary to go 100 miles or more inland aft

e food supply of the country is practically gone, and that there is no future for 
is people unless a new food supply is furnished. This he sees to be through the 
troduction of domestic reindeer, and for himself and his family desires an early 
portunity of learning how to have and care for the new food supply. As he 
as indorsed by the missionary, I agreed to take him, and securing permission 
‘om Captain Tuttle, brought him on board the ship with his wife Toakluk, his son 
lhowlock, his daughter Neuta, and his adopted daughters Kontelow and Ahlahle. 
r. John W. Kelly, who has been in the arctic region for eleven years, also sought 
d received permission to return south with the Bear. ; 
Having received on board the annual mail and finished our work at Point Bar- 
w,at 3.45 p. m. August 15 the Bear got under way for the south, working 
lowly through the heavy drift ice. 
During the 16th Point Belcher was passed. The whaling schooners Rosario and 
‘ermaid were met and their mail taken on board. AH day the cutter Bear worked 
x way through the drift ice. On the 17th we finally got out of the Arctic ice 
to clear water, and after a most gorgeous sunset, at 11.50 midnight, anchored off 
e Corwincoal mine for fresh water. The forenoon of August 18 was consumed. 
the crew in getting fresh water. Two of the officers went ashore to hunt: 
armigan. While tramping over the tundra they found the tent, clothing, and 
eleton of a white man; also his sled and other belongings. As no white man is 
own to be missing, and as neither natives nor white men in the vicinity knew 
ything about it, the dead man must have been a prospector who had come alone 
ross the wilderness the previous winter, and worn out, perhaps out of provisions, 
d starved and perished upon that bleak shore of the Arctic Ocean. Since his 
mains have been found, the people at Point Hope,.60 miles away, recall the fact 
at during the previous winter two unknown and half-starved sled dogs had 
me to the village. 
Having watered ship, at 1.80 p.m. anchor was hoisted and we stood to the west- 
rd to round Cape Lisbourne, where we have always found a rough sea, and this 
ar was noexception. At 10.30 a. m. the ship anchored off Cooper’s whaling sta- 
n, Point Hope, and the stores, the whalebone, and fifteen sailors of the wrecked 
ooner Hidalgo were received on board for passage to Unalaska; also the whale- 
ne from the whaling bark Gay Head; also mails for the south were received 
m the whalers and the village. The herder Ahlook, whom I had brought to 
int Hope to visit his friends, also returned on board, and at 5.30 p. m. the 
chor was hoisted and we started for Kotzebue Sound, passing Cape Krusen- 
rn on the morning of August 20. About 6 p.m. in the afternoon we tookin tow 
r umiaks with their loads of people en route to Kotzebue Sound, and at 9.30 
m. anchored off Cape Blossom. During the night large numbers of natives 
e on board from shore, but as the sea began to be very rough, they left for 
d, and at 9a. m. on the 2ist the vessel got under way for shelter, which it 
ured at 2.25 p.m. near Choris Peninsula. We reached that place at noon, none 
early, as the storm had increased to a gale. 
t had been expected that the steam launch would be sent to Elephant Point to 
estigate the unusual quantity of the bones of the mammoth which have been 
osed by the elements at that point. But during the morning of August 22, the 
ather continuing stormy and the gale apparently increasing, the captain con- 
ded to go to sea, and at 11.15 a.m. we got under way and drove before the 
rm. At 5.50 p.m. Cape Krusenstern was abeam, and at 8.55 p. m. the west 
int of Cape Espenberg was abeam. During Sunday, August 23, it alternately 
wed and rained, the wind blowing a gale. As the steamer could make no 
dway against the storm, we sailed with the wind, and were taken a long dis- 
ce westward out of our course. At 11.25 on the 24th ice appeared ahead of us, 
all afternoon we steamed through heavy drift ice. About 5 p.m. Hast Cape, 
eria, loomed up in the distance through the fog, and as we approached it made 
eautiful sight. East Cape and the Diomede Islands were covered with fresh- 
len snow from summit down to the water’s edge. The ship attempted to make 
alen Village, Siberia, but found that the ice was packed from the shore 5 miles 
to sea. We then turned and tried to make East Cape, Siberia, but again we 
re headed off by the ice, which was packed to sea 3 miles out from the cape. 
midnight the captain gave up the struggle and allowed the steamer to drift, 
il the following morning he could make another attempt to reach East Cape. 
t+ with the coming of the morning, August 25, the situation was no better, and 
ing up the attempt to reach Hast Cape, the ship skirted around the south end 
he ice floe, and at 8 o’clock came to anchor in clear water in the bight south of 
Cape. A number of umiak loads of Siberians came on board to see the physi- 
in and do some trading. 
   
-P-A-G-E-508

At 11.10 a. m., the thick fog clearing up, the ship got under way and stood fc 
the Siberian village on Ratmanoff Island, one of the Diomedes, where we anchore 
at 3.23 p.m. Three loads of Siberians came off to the ship. Stopping for 
hour, we were again under way for the American side of the Straits, but at 5.‘ 
p.m. stopped to receive a boatload of natives from the village on Kruseaste 
Island, At 5.50 p.m. we were again under way for Cape Prince of Wales, reac 
ing there soon after midnight. Being unable to effect a landing, the ship turn 
and put out to sea again for safety. With the morning light of August 26 tl 
ship returned to the village of Cape Prince of Wales and anchored at 7.45 a. 
Shortly afterwards Mr. W. T. Lopp, the missionary, came ori board with so 
natives. Immediately after breakfast Dr. Lyall, the physician, and myself we: 
ashore with Mr. Lopp. The affairs of the mission and school were looked after, 
number of natives were attended to by the physician, and at noon we returned 
the ship. Soon after, the schooner Ella Johnson, John T. Smith master, anchorq 
near by. Mr. Minor W. Bruce and party for trading for reindeer were on boar 
Accompanying Lieutenant Hall, I paid a visit to the schooner and had a co: 
versation with Mr. Bruce concerning arrangements for securing reindeer. Up: 
returning to the Bear, I was greatly surprised to find that the sailing papers 
the Elia Johnson were defective, and that not being properly registered t! 
schooner could not go to Siberia and trade for reindeer, as was expected.  T: 
closed all hope of procuring reindeer from Siberia this year. 
At 2.45 p.m. we got under way for Port Clarence. <A dense fog having set i 
at 10.30 p. m. the ship came to anchor at Point Jackson, at the entrance of t. 
harbor. The-next morning, the fog having lifted, at 5.40 a.m. the ship got und 
way, and at 8 o’clock anchored off Point Riley after fresh water. Having water 
ship, at 2.45 p. m. the Bear got under way and steamed over to the Teller Rei 
deer Station, on the north side of the bay, where the captain kindly allowed 
together with the herders, Ahlook, Electoona, and Oozhaloo and his family, 
jand, after which the steamer ran down to Point Spencer for a sheltered place 
which to make repairs and changes in her propeller. At the station we were vel 
busy looking after the details of the business until after midnight. During t 
morning of August 28 Lieutenant Cochran came over from Point Spencer wij 
the steam launch and, picking up Dr. Lyall, Mr. Kjellmann, Dr. Kittlesen, 
John W. Kelly, Mr. Wells, mate of the Hidalgo, three herders, and myself, steam) 
away for Grantley Harbor, to visit the reindeer herd. Landing about 11 a. n 
we had lunch on the beach, after which we walked to the reindeer camp, 4 mi. 
distant. It was avery hard walk. At the time of the arrival of the Bear 
epidemic had appeared in the herd, causing a swelling and suppuration arouw: 
the hoofs. A brush corral had been constructed and some 30 sick deer gather] 
into it. The two physicians of the party, with the herders, proceeded to give 
examination, and a portion of the diseased heart and liver of one that had di 
was placed in alcohol, to be sent to the Agricultural Department at Washingt 
for expert examination. 
As it had proved a very hard walk from the depot to the herd, the Lapps pj 
posed.to send me back by a sled drawn by the reindeer. The deer had not b 
itched up all summer and were very frisky. The result was that the very fi 
brook that we came to they gave a leap, overturning the sled, throwing me 
into the bushes, and nearly breaking away from the drivers. The sled was righ’ 
and I again got on. The rest of the way they took me along rapidly over 
snowless tundra, across a mountain, through bunches of arctic willow, up aj 
down the steep sides of the ravines, and landed me safe and sound on the be 
in an astonishingly short time. After lunch we embarked in the launch for 
station. Inthe meantime the wind had changed and _ got up a rough sea wh: 
tossed and pitched the steam launch, greatly to our discomfort. Reaching 
station at 7 o’clock, I went ashore, and the others continued on their way to 
ship at Point Spencer. 
August 29 dawned with a storm raging at sea and a heavy surf on the bea 
As there was no going out or returning ashore, the day was spent without int 
ruption looking over the affairs of the station, Sunday morning, August 30, ca: 
in with fog. The gale of the previous day had ceased. At 11 o'clock the bell v 
rungand divine service held in the schoolhouse. Thirty-three persons were pr] 
ent, comprising nine nationalities. There were Americans, Norwegians, Lap 
Ootlaeavies, Tigaraites, Kinegans, Kaveans, Seelawiks, and natives around Nor 
Sound. The preacher spoke in English. The Rey. T. L. Brevig, Norwegian m 
ister, translated the English into Lappish, and Dora, an Eskimo girl from Golo 
Bay, translated the English into Eskimo, thus requiring three languages to re: 
the audience. It was an interesting and unique service.

hrown out of the house by her mother to freeze to death, the mother not wishing 
‘he trouble of bringing her up. An older sister took pity on the babe, brought 
er into the house, and assumed charge of her. After a while the sister became 
ired of her charge, and again the babe was thrown out of doors to perish. Then 
neighboring woman took her in and brought her up as her own child. When 
she was about 12 years of age, she was sold to a man for his wife, but being bru- 
ally treated, she ran away and found an asylum at the Swedish mission. The 
‘ission was raided by the natives and the girl carried off by force. Again escap- 
ng, she was permitted to remain at the mission, where she has become a strong, 
ne-looking. intelligent, consecrated girl, of about 17 years of age. At presentshe 
is living with Rey. and Mrs. Brevig at the reindeer station. As I rose from the 
inner table the cutter Bear was seen steaming over from Cape.Spencer. I was 
ery sorry, as it would probably necessitate going on board ship on Sunday, thus 
letting a bad example to the natives, and I had repeatedly given strict orders 
gainst all unnecessary Sunday work at the station. True enough. orders came 
irom the captain to come on board, as he would sail immediately. Lieutenant 
all was sent with a steam launch to arrest some natives for various misdemean- 
rs, and Mr. Kjellmann was sent to the herd to secure some necessary vouchers 
rom the Lapps. The launch having returned from Grantley Harbor, adieus were 
poken to the friends on shore, and at 8.30 p.m. the anchor was hove, and we 
teamed away for St. Michael. The fog setting in heavy, we anchored outside at 
‘ape Spencer at 10.20p.m, The next morning we were under way at7.40, reaching 
t. Michael at 11.40 p. m., September 1. 
In the harbor were the brigantine C. C. Funk, John Calliston, master; the 
thooner Alice Cooke, D. B. P. Penhallon, master, and the steamer Lakme, Charles 
nderson, master. Letters were received trom the Swedish stations at Unalaklik 
d at Golovin.Bay, calling attention to the failure of the fish supply this season 
nd the prospect of a famine during the next winter; also making inquiries 
‘hether it was not possible for provisions to be left at those stations. September 
, Mr. H. De Windt, correspondent of the Pall Mall Gazette, London, England, 
as taken on board, with supplies, to be landed at Indian Point, Siberia, from 
hence he expected to make a sled trip across Siberia; also Lewis Sloss, jr., and 
udolph Neumann, of the Alaska Commercial Company, and Rev. P. T. Rowe, 
e Episcopal bishop of Alaska, for transportation to Unalaska. At 9.20 p. m. 
rewell salutes were fired from the ship and the battery on shore, and we stood 
t of the harbor for East Cape, Siberia. 
On September 5, encountering a gale with a rough sea, the vessel, being unable 
proceed, hove to. The following morning, making out King Island looming 
ip through the fog, the ship got under way at 5.25 o’clock and attempted to reach 
, which was accomplished at 8.55, when we anchored under the lee of the island 
reast of the village. 
Soon a number of natives crowded the deck. The northwest storm continuing 
ith unabated severity and the time drawing near when the ship was under orders 
report at Unalaska, the captain concluded to give up attempting to reach East 
ape and to make at once for Indian Point; hence at 5 a. m., September 7, we were 
ain under way. In the afternoon we came up with a large quantity of heavy 
ift ice, which we skirted for a long distance. On Tuesday, at 4.20 a..m., we 
copped anchor off Indian Point. Mr. H. De Windt, with servant and supplies, 
as sent ashore. All possible arrangements having been made for his comfort, 
10 p. m. we again got under way and stood for St. Lawrence Island, where we 
me to anchor at 3 4.m.on the morning of September 9. As there was coal to 
nd for the use of the school, I went ashore with the first load to confer with the 
acher and look over school matters. After breakfast Lieutenant Jarvis and Dr. 
yall, the physician, came ashore and performed a surgical operation on a child. 
e ailments of various natives were also attended to. While at lunch on shore 
steam whistle blew for our return to theship. Upon boarding ship the anchor 
as hove and we got under way for the Pribilof Islands. That day and the fol- 
wing one were charming—as old sailors say, ‘‘ weather breeders,” and so it 
‘oved to us. During the night of the 10th and 11th the wind changed dead 
ead and we hove to, the wind blowing a gale from the southeast and a heavy 
a running; but little sleep was had on board the ship. 
On the morning of September 12, there being a little lull in the gale, the ship 
ain resumed her course, but in the evening the storm resumed its fury and we 
ere again hove to under double-reefed mainsail. On the morning of the 13th at 
.m. the gale split the fore trysail. All that day and the following day and the 
y after that, the storm raged in itsfury. The supply of coal in the steamer was 
tting low. The date at which the captain was to report at Unalaska had passed, 
, making a desperate effort and proceeding as best we could through the storm,

we were fortunate enough to get into the harbor of Unalaska, the quiet waters 
which seemed very delightful after the tossing of the previous week. Going asho: 
for our mail, I had the unpleasant experience to find that through some one’ 
blunder my whole mail for the summer had been sent into the Arctic, and event 
ally did not reach me until weeks after my return to my office in Washingto: 
This, however, was not as bad as the disappointment of the teachers and trade: 
at Point Hope and Point Barrow in the Arctic at the loss of their annual mai 
which was sent them in the spring of 1895. It has not yet reached them, an 
information secured recently in the office at Washington locates the missing maj 
still on Puget Sound. If there are no further delays, the letters which were se: 
in the spring of 1895 will probably reach their destination in the fall of 1897—t 
and a half years after they started. 
At Unalaska, finding that the United States revenue cutter Wolcott was und 
orders to proceed to Sitka, I sought and secured permission from Captain Hoop 
to accompany her. Going on board the morning of the 20th of September, we g 
under way during the forenoon and proceeded to sea in company with the cu 
ters Corwin and Grant and two English men-of-war. It was the disbanding 
the Bering Sea fleet for the season. The passage through the Aleutian Islan 
was made by the Analga Pass. The day was pleasant and the sail along tl 
south side of the Aleutian Islands with their wonderful scenery delightful. 
the 21st a short call was made at Belkofsky to ascertain the condition of asm: 
Aleutian settlement, where the people were said to be out of food. Learning thi 
the settlement was safe, we were again under way for Sitka. The pleasant weath: 
of the 20th and 21st was the calm before the approaching storm. While tornado} 
were sweeping along the Atlantic coast, destroying much property in towns a1 
cities, a similar storm raged along the Pacific, and, commencing with the 22d, f 
a week we were tossed and buffeted as the North Pacific in the late fall knoy 
how to do. Much anxiety was felt for the safety of our vessel. Boxes of oil we; 
adjusted so that the drippings could stay somewhat the severity of the waves, a: 
no doubt contributed greatly to the safety of the vessel. But it is a long road thi 
has noturn. So after the discomforts of the protracted storm, we entered on t! 
eet the land-locked island-studded harbor of Sitka with satisfaction and than] 
‘ulness. 
The interval between September 29 and the departure of the mail Steamer C7

   CHAPTER XXXVI. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
Tho statistics of city schools as a whole show little difference from year to year 
except in the matter of growth. The relation of the items to each other, as shown 
by the various ratios and percentages, change but little, and the changes of one 
year are often counterbalanced during the next. But cities still grow apace and 
the schools grow with them. 
Two factors enter into the aggregate growth of cities, one being the growth of 
cities already recognized as such and the other being the growth of villages to the 
joint where they must be classed with cities and their activities reckoned in any 
iscussion of city affairs. The greater part of the increases that occur are ascrib- 
ble to the former factor, for the growth of the same cities usually amount in the 
weregate to about 44 per cent a year, while the increase due to the influx of new 
ities would probably not be over 2 per cent in any year. The difficulty of cor- 
ectly determining the extent of the annual accessions has often been mentioned in 
these reports. There are scores of places that are nearing the boundary line that 
ivides the village from the city, and unless there is an annual census it is impos- 
‘ible to say precisely how many of them come over the lineinany year. It is haz- 
rdous, therefore, to present a list of ‘‘ cities of over 8,000 inhabitants” without 
ome reservation and qualification. But due diligence is exercised in the Bureau 
0 discover evidences of growth, and care is taken in the admission of new cities. 
‘he lists presented are therefore as good as the facilities of this office permit, and 
re worthy of consideration if not of implicit confidence. 
The following table shows the relative importance of the city school enrollment 
or the past six years. Prior to 1890-91 the statistics of all places having over 
,000 inhabitants were tabulated together, and it is not practicable to extend the 
omparison further than that year:

8, 484, 255 24.2 
  The comparatively low rate of growth indicated for the first two years in the 
‘bove table is explainable by the difficulty in this office of discovering newly 
leveloped cities, a difficulty that was largely remedied in 1893-94 by beginning 
he systematic collection of school statistics of smaller places, in order to secure 
ata as to their yearly growth. This measure at once disclosed the-fact that 81 
laces not previously reckoned as having 8,000 inhabitants were worthy of consid- 
ration as cities. This heavy accession to the list ran up the percentage of increase 
jhown by the tables to 8.68 per cent for that year, and counterbalanced the low 
‘ures of the two years previous, 
1487  
-P-A-G-E-530
    1488 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. _ 
The average annual increase indicated since 1890-91 has been 5.80 per cent in 
geometrical ratio. The enrollment in the table for 1890-91 is probably a little too 
Jow as compared with the other figures, and it is likely that the actual increase 
has been about 5.50 per cent or approximately that shown for the last two years. 
The last column in the table clearly shows the greater progress which cities and 
city schools are making in comparison with rural and village schools. These do 
not often decrease in actual numbers, but their relative gain is small in compari- 
son with the city schools. The former class have gained only 1 per cent a year on 
an average since 1891. Itis not yet practicable to go beyond this and determine 
the relative increase in village and in country schools, or, in other words, in graded 
and in ungraded schools; but there is every reason to believe that if the figures 
could be made they would show that even the 1 per cent increase comes entirely 
from schools in the villages. It is probable, in fact, that there is a steady decline 
in the number of country ungraded schools. New schools of this kind are con- 
stantly established, but on the other hand their number is being continually les- 
-sened by those which attain the dignity of the graded school. 
The recent movement toward consolidating country schools and making graded 
schools of them must also have its effect upon their number within a few years at 
most. 
In regard to the comparative tables in which the relations of the several statis- 
tical items to each other are shown, it may be said that no new tendencies of a 
permanent character are indicated, although many facts of interest are brought 
out, and additional evidence is disclosed of certain tendencies previously observed 
and mentioned. 
The estimates of the several superintendents seem to show a continual decline in 
the relative enrollment in schools other than public. Of the whole number of 
children in school, there were in private and parochial schools 21.5 per cent in 
1891-92, 21.2 per cent in 1892-93, 20.8 per cent in 1893-94, 20.3 per cent in 1894-95, 
and 19.6 per cent in 1895-96. 
It must be confessed, however, that the statistics of private schools are far from 
satisfactory. Wholly without public control, and usually without public super- 
vision, it is, except in two or three States, the legal duty of no local authority to 
collect or compile the statistics relating to them. And being often of temporary 
and evanescent character, to say nothing of their numbers, it is out of the ques- 
tion for this office to gather their statistics directly. An estimate is all than can 
be given in most cases; and since the use of estimates is necessary, no one is bet- 
ter capable of making those estimates than the city superintendents. Unfor- 
tunately even they are generally without any real basis for an estimate, and what 
is reported is often a mere guess. The tendency is noticeable, too, to ‘‘use the 
same figures as last year.” It is largely due to this, probably, that the reported 
enrollmentin private and parochial schools stands almost stationary—the increase 
in 1895-96 was only about three-fourths of 1 per cent—and since the public schools 
continually advance, the indicated proportion in the private schools naturally 
grows steadily less. : 
The figures in the tables are not wholly without value in themselves, but the 
principal reason that data confessedly unreliable are presented every year is the 
hope, which is founded on experience, that continually asking for certain facts 
will in time lead to the taking of steps to furnish them. The work of private 
schools is a necessary factor in the sum total of education. No thorough account- 
ing can be made of the educational excellencies or deficiencies of any city unless 
they be taken into account, and this is especially important where any attempt is 
made to enforce compulsory attendance laws. For these purposes théir statistics 
are just as essential as those of the public schools, and it is to be hoped that the 
time will soon come when their work will be as fully and as accurately recorded 
and reported as that of the public schools. 
The average length of school term has increased 1.3 days over 1894-95, but this 
seems to be one of those variations that occur constantly without having any 
special significance in indicating a general tendency, since the average term in 
1893-94 was 191.5, or one-tenth of a day longer than in 1895-96. Thesame absence 
of a Reuerel tendency may be seen in the changes in the per cent of. attendance to 
enrollment, and in the number of pupils to each teacher. 
But in regard to the matter of supervision, it is plain that supervising officers 
are becoming yearly more numerous. One supervisor to 17.9 teachers is now the 
ratio, the proportion having steadily grown from 1 to 20.2 teachers four years ago. 
The term ‘‘supervisors” must include, of course, all those who do not actually! 
teach classes, but whose duties are to aid and direct those who do. Principals who} 
do not teach, and specialists, like writing and drawing teachers, whose lessons are| 
only for purposes of illustration, while the main work is done by class teachers,

      e embraced in this category, as well as superintendents and assistant superin- 
ndents. There have been few instances of noticeably large accession to the 
pervising force, but as a whole the number has grown much more rapidly than 
ther teachers or pupils. There is an increasing inclination to relieve principals 
all teaching, and in some cities the rules requiring principals of large schools to 
ach a portion of each day have become dead letters through their nonobservance, 
Male teachers increased in number by only 36, that is, from 5,023 to 5,059, during 
e past year, while females have increased by 8,295, or from 61,971 to 65,266. In 
veral of the larger cities there have been material reductions in the number of 
ale teachers in the last year. There are now very few places in which men are 
ployed as teachers in the elementary schools, nearly all the males reported being 
the high schools or in the manual training shops. Men arestillin the majority 
ong principals and supervising officers, but even there the proportion of women 
constantly increasing, and necessarily so; there are no training schools for 
cers, and the natural way to get them is by promotion from the ranks, and as 
ere are only women in the ranks the officers will be women, too. 
Notwithstanding the continuance of hard times the cost of the schools has 
creased more rapidly than the pupils. An examination of the detailed statistics 
r the last two years shows a number of conspicuous instances of reduction in 
e number of teachers; and it is a matter of common knowledge that in several 
ities there were general reductions in salaries. But all these were more than 
ade up in the aggregate by increases in other cities. The average daily cost of 
structing each pupil in attendance was less in 1895-96 than in the year before, 
¢ the schools were open a little longer and the number of pupils to each teacher 
las slightly greater, so that the average amount received by members of the 
pervising and teaching force actually increased from $625 to $648. It cost about 
cents a day on an average to instruct a pupil; and other expenses, including 
w buildings, repairs, janitors, supplies, etc., ran the whole cost up to about 164 
mts a day.

CHAPTER XXXVII 
STATISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For the scholastic year ending June, 1896, there were 559,003 students receiving 
secondary instruction in institutions reporting to the Bureau of Education. This 
was an increase of 19,291 over the number reported for the year ending June, 1895. 
The number of students pursuing secondary studies in the elementary schools and 
not reported separately probably does not exceed 50,000. A fair estimate of the 
total number of secondary students in the United States would be 600,000. The 
559,003 secondary students reported for 1896 were distributed among eight classes 
of institutions, as follows:

Private colleges for women 4,916

| 305, 101 
    
The above table does not take into account students of secondary grade in busi- 
ness colleges. The total number of students reported by 398 business colleges was 
80,662, and of these 37,630 were in regular commercial courses and may be regarded 
as secondary students. These added to the total of the above table would swell 
the total number of secondary students reported to 596,633. 
The purpose of this chapter is to review the statistics of public and private high 
schools, these two classes of institutions having nearly seven-eighths of all the 
secondary students in the United States. 
The following table shows the growth of public and private high schools for the 
past seven years:

The increase in the total number of secondary students in seven years has been 
nearly 64 per cent, the increase in the number of public secondary students being 
87 per cent, while the private secondary students increased only 12 per cent.

is graphically illustrated by the diagram on the next page. The private schools 
reached their highest enrollment in 1893-94, when they had 118,645 students. 
Since then the number has decreased nearly 12,000. The statistics for 1892-93 
were incomplete, but the number of public secondary students for that year is 
estimated at 260,000 and the number of private secondary students:at 103,000. 
The following table of percentages shows the pecwon ion of students in public 
high schools as compared with private high schools for each year since 1890:

In 1890 the public high schools comprised less than 61 per cent of the number of 
secondary schools, while in 1896 they had increased to over 70 per cent. In 1890 
the public high schools had nearly 56 per cent of the teachers, while in 1896 they 
had over 64 per cent. In 1890 the public high schools had 68 per cent of the sec- 
ondary students, and in 1896 they had 78 per cent. 
Pusiic HieH SCHOOLS. 
It is found convenient to examine separately the statistics of public high schools 
and private high schools and academies and finally to combine the results in a 
statistical review of secondary education. 
In this chapter Tables 1 to 10, inclusive, are summaries of the statistics of pub- 
lic high schools, Tables 11 to 22 relate exclusively to private high schools and 
academies, while Tables 23 to 29 combine the statistics of public and private high 
schools. Tables 29 and 30 show the distribution of secondary students in the various 
classes of institutions. 
The number of public high schools reporting to this office for the year ending 
June, 1896, was 4,974, as may be seen from Table 1. Of the total number 1,814 
were reported as independent high schools, and 3,160 as high school departments 
of city or village systems. Here was an increase of 262 public high schools over 
the number reported for the previous year. 
The number of teachers employed in instructing secondary students in the public 
high schools was 15,700, the number of men being 7,226 and the number of women 
8,474. This does not include the teachers whose time was wholly employed in 
instructing pupils in elementary grades attached to many high schools. 
The number of secondary students in the 4,974 schools was 380,493, the number 
of boys being 157,942, and the girls numbering 222,551, or 58.49 per cent of the 
whole number. More than half the secondary students, or 195,634, were in the 
North Central Division, composed of 12 States. The North Atlantic Division, 
composed of 9 States, had 114,731, while the remaining 29 States and Territories 
included in the two Southern divisions and the Western Division had only 70,128 
secondary students in public high schools. 
In the public high schools of the North Atlantic, North Central, and Western 
divisions and in colored high schools of the two Southern divisions were 4,708 
colored secondary students. 
The last column of Table 1 shows that there were 253,980 pupils receiving instruc- 
tion in elementary departments attached to public high schools. These elementary 
pupils belonged largely to the independent high schools.   
STUDENTS AND COURSES OF STUDY. 
Of the 380,493 secondary students in the public high schools, only 52,597, or less 
than 14 per cent, were preparing for college. Table 2 shows that 29,222 were pre- 
i ring for the college classical course and 23,375 for college scientific courses. 
‘he number of students preparing for college was 13,82 per cent of the whole

number of secondary students. The number of male students preparing for col- 
lege was 16,60 per cent of the whole number of male students, while the number 
of female students preparing for college was 11.85 per cent of the whole number 
of female students. It appears that 8.96 per cent of the male students were pre- 
paring for the college classical course and 7.64 for college scientific courses, while 
6.77 per cent of the female students were preparing for the college classical course 
and 5.08 per cent for the college scientific courses. These percentages and others 
showing the proportions of male and female students in certain studies are given in 
the following table:

a Per cent to number of graduates. 
Table 2 also shows that there were 45,864 graduates from the public high 
schools for the year ending June, 1896. This was 12.05 per cent of the whole 
number of secondary students. The 16,498 male graduates are 10.45 per cent of 
the male students, and the 29,366 female graduates are 13.20 per cent of the female 
students, as shown in the above table. 
The number of college preparatory students in the graduating classes for 1896 
was 13,428, or 29.28 per cent of the graduates. The above table shows that 37.47 
per cent of the male graduates were college preparatory students, and 24.67 per 
cent of the female graduates were college preparatory students. 
Tables 3,4,5,and 6 give the number of students pursuing each.of the sixteen 
leading high-school studies in each State, while Tables 8 and 9 show the per cent 
of students in each study to the total number of students. 
In 1895-96 in the public high schools of the United States 175,715 students were 
studying Latin. This was 46.18 per cent of the whole number of secondary stu- 
dents. The 69,092 male students studying Latin were 48.75 per cent of the whole 
number of male secondary students, and the 106,623 female students in Latin were 
47.91 per cent of the whole number of female students. 
By reference to the same tables it is found that 11,821 students, or 3.11 per cent 
of the whole number, were studying Greek; 26,597, or 6.99 per cent, were study- 
ing French; 45,670, or 12 per cent, were in German; 207,912, or 54.64 per cent, in 
algebra; 99,816, or 26.23 per cent, in geometry; 9,448, or 2.48 per cent, in trigonom- 
etry; 16,753, or 4.40 per cent, in astronomy; 84,005, or 22.08 per cent, in physics; 
84,046, or 8.95 per cent, in chemistry; 97,174, or 25.54 per cent, in physical geogra- 
phy; 18,282, or 4.80 per cent, in geology; 121,517, or 31.94 per cent, in physiology; 
11.482, or 3 per cent, in psychology; 123,063, or 32.84 per cent, in rhetoric; 184,236, 
or 35.28 per cent, in history other than United States history. 
The preceding table, headed ‘‘ Students in certain courses and studies,” shows the 
per cent of male students in each study to the total number of male students and
-P-A-G-E-601
STATISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 1559 
the per cent of female students in each study to the total number.of female stu- 
dents. It will be seen that the percentages of male students studying Greek, alge- 
bra, trigonometry, physics, chemistry, physical geography, and physiology were 
larger than the percentages of female students in the same studies, while the female 
students had larger percentages in Latin, French, German, geometry, astronomy, 
geology, psychology, rhetoric, and history. 
In this connection, it may be interesting to note the proportion of secondary stu- 
dents in public high schools pursuing certain courses of study or studying certain 
branches each year for the past seven years. In 1890 the per cent of students pre- 
paring for the college classical course was 7.38, while the per cent in 1896 was 7.68. 
The lowest percentage was 6.04in 1891, and the highest 7.87 in 1894. In 1890 theper 
cent of students preparing for college scientific courses was 7.06, while the per cent 
in 1896 wasonly 6.14. Thelowest percentage was 5.80 in 1891, and the highest 7.10 in 
1893. Combining the two classes of preparatory students, it is found that in 1890 . 
the per cent preparing for college was 14.44, while in 1896 the per cent was only 
13.82, 
These percentages and the per cent of students each year in certain studies are 
given in the following table:

a Per cent to total number graduates. 
The per cent of students in Latin increased from 34.69 in 1890 to 46.18 in 1896, 
the per cent in French increased from 5.84 to 6.99, the per cent in German from 
10.51 to 12, the per cent in algebra from 45.40 to 54.64, the per cent in geometry 
from 21.33 to 26.23, and the per cent in history from 27.31 in 1890 to 35.28 in 1896. 
These are the only studies in which there has been marked increase in the number 
of students. There was a decrease in the per cent of students in chemistry from 
10.10 in 1890 to 8.95 in 1896. 
The above table also shows that 10.78 per cent of the public high-school students 
graduated in 1890 and 12.05 per cent graduated in 1896. 
It is noted that there has been little change in the proportion of male and female 
students. In 1890 the per cent of males was 42.67, the highest for any year of the 
seven, while in 1896 the per cent was 41.51. The lowest per cent of male students 
was 40.10, in 1893, 
EQUIPMENT AND INCOME, 
  _, Table 10 shows the equipment and income of public high schools so far as the 
items could be summarized from the reports. Of the 4,974 schools 3,921 are reported 
as having libraries containing in the aggregate 1,922,923 volumes. This would give
-P-A-G-E-602
1560 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
an average of 490 volumes to a library. In the North Atlantic Division the aver- 
age is 696 volumes to a library, in the South Atlantic 353, in the South Central 
804, in the North Central 439, and in the Western Division 413. 
The value of grounds, buildings, scientific apparatus, etc., reported by 3,872 
schools was $74,684,740, an average of $19,288 to the school. 
The amount of State and municipal aid received by 2,281 public high schools was 
$5,312,517, an average of $2,329 to the school. This average seems very small, and 
itis probable that the greater part of the $2,647,166 reported by 1,078 schools as 
“income from other sources and unclassified” should be credited to State and 
municipal aid. 
The amount received from tuition fees by 2,582 schools was $808,339, while 248 
schools received $305,620 from productive funds. 
The total income reported by 3,207 schools was $9,073,642, an average of $2,829 to 
the school. Of the 1,767 schools which did not report their income, the majority 
were departments of city school systems in which separate accounts are not kept of 
high school expenditures. For a similar reason a large number of schools could 
not report the value of grounds and buildings. 
Sixty-five schools reported the receipt of $39,318 from benefactions, while 152 
schools reported permanent endowments aggregating $3,279,413. There were 96 
schools receiving income from productive funds which failed to report the amounts 
of their endowments. 
PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES. 
In Tables 11 to 22, inclusive, are summarized the statistics of 2,106 private high 
schools, academies, seminaries, and other institutions under private management 
offering secondary instruction. The forms of inquiry sent to these schools are 
similar to those sent to public high schools, and the statistical summaries are 
arranged so that the public and private secondary schools may be readily com- 
pared, Tables 11 to 20 may be compared with Tables 1 to 10 in consecutive order. 
Table 11 shows that 2,106 private high schools and academies reported to this 
office, for the scholastic year ending June, 1896, a decrease of 74 in the number of 
schools for the previous year. The number of teachers reported as instructing 
secondary students in these schools was 8,752, an increase of 193 in the number of 
. teachers. The number of secondary students reported was 106,654, or 11,693 less 
than for the previous year. The number of students was almost equally divided 
as to sex, there being 53,491 males and 53,163 females. 
Included with the 106,654 students were 2,184 colored students pursuing second- 
ary studies. Of this number 1.740 were in colored schools of secondary grade in 
the Southern States. 
The number of elementary pupils in the 2,106 schools was 120,764, an increase 
of 6,886 over the previous year. In the elementary grades the number of boys 
was 55,073 and the number of girls 65,691. 
STULENTS AND COURSES OF STUDY. 
The number of students in private high schools and academies preparing for 
college in 1895-96 was 31,231, or more than 29 per cent of the whole number of 
secondary students. The per cent of college preparatory students in the public 
high schools was less than 14. Of the 31,231 college preparatory students 19,733 
were preparing for the classical course and 11,498 for scientific courses, as shown 
in Table 12. The number of male students preparing for college was 38.98 per 
cent of the whole number of male students, while the per cent of female students 
preparing for college was only 19.53. There were 11,289 graduates in 1896, or 10.58 
per cent of the whole number of secondary students, and 46.55 per cent of these 
graduates had been preparing for college. These percentages are shown in the 
table on next page.

          a Per cent to number of graduates. 
Of the 5,818 male graduates, 3,518, or 60.47 per cent, had prepared for college; 
and of the 5,471 female graduates, 1,737, or 31.75 per cent, had prepared for college. 
The above table also shows the per cent of male students in each of sixteen 
studies as compared with the whole number of male students, and also the per 
cent of female students in each of these studies as compared with the whole num- 
ber of female students. It will be noted that larger percentages of male students 
are in Latin, Greek, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, while in all the other 
studies the percentages of female students are greater. 
Tables 18, 14, 15, and 16 show the number of students, male and female, in each 
of the sixteen leading high school studies in the private high schools and acade- 
mies of each State, while Tables 18 and 19 show the per cent of students in each 
study to the total number of students. ‘ 
Table 17 shows for each State the per cents of male and female students, the per 
cent preparing for the college classical course, the per cent preparing for college 
scientific courses, and_also the per cent graduating in 1896. The last column 
shows that of the whole number of graduates 46.55 per cent had been preparing 
for college. 
The table which follows indicates the progress made by the private high schools 
and academies since 1890 as relates to the number of students in certain courses 
and studies. In 1890 the per cent of students preparing for the college classical 
course was 17.54 and in 1896 it was 18.50. In 1890 the per cent of students prepar- 
ing for college scientific courses was 10.16 and in 1896 the per cent was 10.78. The 
total number college preparatory students increased from 27.70 per cent in 1890 to 
29.28 per cent in 1896.

  a Per cent to total number of graduates. 
The above table also shows that the per cent of graduates increased from 8.50 
in 1890 to 10.58 in 1896. . But there has been a gradual decrease in the percentage 
of college preparatory students in the graduating classes. In 1891 the per cent 
of graduates prepared for college to the whole number of graduates was 61.37, 
while in 1896 the per cent was only 46.55. 
This table also shows that the number of students in Latin increased from 31.32 
per cent in 1890 to 46.36 per cent in 1896, the number in algebra from 37.12 in 1890 
to 49.22 per cent in 1896, and the number in history from 28.98 per cent in 1890 to 
87.35 per cent in 1896. There is not a single instance of a decrease in the percent- 
age of students pursuing a high school study. 
The proportion of male and female students has shown little variation for the 
past seven years. 
EQUIPMENT AND INCOME, 
The items reporting the equipment and income of private high schools and acad- 
emies aresummarized in Table 20. Of the 2,106 schools 1,369 are reported as having 
libraries aggregating 1,594,605 volumes, an average of 1,164 volumes to a library. 
In the North Atlantic Division the average was 1,644 volumes to a library; in the 
North Central Division, 1,168; in the Western Division, 843; in the South Atlantic 
Division, 765, and in the South Central Division, 730. 
The value of grounds, buildings, scientific apparatus, etc., reported by 1,476 
schools was $55,680,935, an average of $37,724 to the school. 
The amount of State and municipal aid received by 309 schools was $222,777, the 
amount received by 1,413 schools from tuition fees was $5,623,550, the amount 
received by 310 schools from productive funds was $1,863,867, while the amount 
received by 435 schools from sources not named was $894,114. The total income of 
1,408 schools reporting was $8,604,308, or an average of $6,111 to the school. 
During the year ending June, 1896, the aggregate received in benefactions by 
197 schools was $1,121,579. The permanent endowment. funds possessed by 345 
institutions aggregated $38,849,434,

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Certain comparisons have been made in the preceding pages between public 
high schools on the one hand, and private high schools, academies, and semina- 
ries on the other. It has been noted that in the private institutions the number 
of secondary students is nearly equally divided between the sexes, while in the 
public high schools the number of female students is largely in excess of the num- 
ber of males. In the private institutions nearly 30 per cent of the secondary stu- 
dents are preparing for college, whilein the public high schools the per cent is less 
than 14. In the private institutions nearly 47 per cent of the students graduating 
had been preparing for college, while in the public high schools less than 30-:per 
cent of the graduates had been preparing for college. 
Other comparisons between the public and the private secondary schools are 
made in Table 23. The average number of secondary students toa public high 
school is about 76, while the private secondary school has only about 51. The 
public secondary school has an average of three teachers, while the private school 
has four. In the public high school there is an average of 24 students to the 
teacher, while in the private school the average is 12, The average number of 
graduates to a public high school is 9, while the average to the private school is 
5. Theaverage number of elementary pupils to a public high school is 51, while 
in the private high school the average is 57, or about 6 more than the average 
number of secondary students in the same institutions. 
In Tables 24 to 29, inclusive, the statistics of public high schools and private high 
schools, academies, and other private institutions of secondary grade are combined. 
Table 24 shows that there were 7,080 public and private secondary schools report- 
ing to this office, and that these schools had 24,452 teachers and 487,147 secondary 
students. The number of male students was 211,433, or 43.40 per cent of the total 
number, while the female secondary students numbered 275,714, or 56.60 per cent 
of the total. 
The remainder of Table 24 and the first four columns of Table 25 show the num- 
ber and per cent of students preparing for college, the classical and the scientific 
students being separately summarized. There were 83,828 students preparing for 
college, or 17.21 per cent of the whole number of secondary students. There were 
48,955 classical preparatory students, and 34,873 preparing for scientific college 
courses. There were 57,153 graduates from the public and private secondary 
schools in 1896, or 11.73 per cent of the whole number of secondary students. Of 
this number of graduates, 18,683, or 32.69 per cent of the number graduating, had 
prepared for college.

aPer cent to number of graduates. 
This table shows that 22.26 per cent of the male students were preparing for 
college and only 13.83 per cent of the female students. In the graduating classes 
43.47 per cent of the males and 25.79 per cent of the female students had prepared 
for college. The male students show larger percentages in Greek, algebra, geom- 
etry, trigonometry, and physics, while the female students had larger percentages 
in the remaining eleven studies. c 
Some idea of the progress of public and private secondary schools for the past seven 
years may be gained by aninspection of the condensed table of percentages given 
low. ‘The table shows the per cent of the secondary students in certain courses 
and studies each year since 1890. The number of students studying Latin in- 
creased from 33.66 per cent in 1890 to 46.22 per cent in 1896. In the same time the 
number in algebra increased from 42.77 per cent to 53.46 per cent, and the num- 
ber in geometry from 20.07 to 25.71 per cent. The number in history increased 
from 27.83 per cent in 1890 to 35.73 per cent in 1896. There was a decrease in the 
number preparing for college from 18.66 per cent in 1890 to 17.21 per cent in 1896, 
but the number of graduates increased from 10.05 per cent to 11.73 per cent. In 
1891 the per cent of graduates prepared for college was 35.74, and in 1896 it had 
fallen to 32.69 per cent. The percentages in the following table would indicate 
that these changes have been in most instances regular from 1890 to 1896:

SECONDARY STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES, 
On the first page of this chapter is a brief table showing the classification of the 
559,003 secondary students in all the institutions reporting to this office. The dis- 
tribution of these students by classes and by States is given in Tables 30 and 81, 
Table 80 shows the number in public high schools, in preparatory departments of 
public universities and colleges, and in public normal schools. The total number 
of secondary students in public institutions was 392,729, the number of males 
being 163,802 and the number of females 229,927. Table 31 shows the number of 
secondary students in private high schools and academies, in preparatory depart- 
ments of private universities and colleges and colleges for women, in private 
normal schools, and in manual training schools. The total number of secondary 
students in these private institutions was 166,274, the number of males being 
90,100 and the females 76,174. The third column of Table 30 gives the total num- 
ber of secondary students in each State. 
The number of secondary students to each 1,000 of population in 1896 was 7.92, 
The North Atlantic Division had 8.06 secondary students to each 1,000 of popula- 
tion, the North Central had 10.03, the South Atlantic had 4.79, the South Central 
had 4,91, and the Western Division had 8.53 secondary students to each 1,000 of 
population. These figures and the number of secondary students to each 1,000 of 
population in each State are given in the third column of Table 32. 
For convenience of comparison, the number of students in higher education to 
each 1,000 of population in each State is given in the last column of Table 32. The 
total number is 139,611, as may be seen in the beginning of the chapter on ‘‘ Higher 
Education,” or 1.98 to each 1,000 of population. 
Table 33 contains in detail the statistics of the 4,974 public high schools sum- 
marized in Tables1to10. Table 34 gives similar statistics of the 2,106 private high 
schools, academies, and other institutions for private secondary instruction.

  CHAPTER XXXVIIL 
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The number of students pursuing training courses for teachers in various insti- 
tutions for the scholastic year 1895-96 was 84,400, an increase of 3,862 over the year 
1894-95. There was an increase of 4,145 in the number of normal students in pub- 
lic normal schools and a decrease of 1,150 in the number in private normal schools. 
There was an increase of 624 in the number of normal students in universities and 
colleges, an increase of 1,437 in the number in public high schools, while there was 
a decrease of 1,194 in the number of normal students in private high schools and 
academies. The following table shows the number of normal students in each class 
of institutions for 1894-95 and for 1895-96: 
Normal students reported for two years.

The decrease in the number of normal students attending private institutions 
may be attributed to the prevailing financial depression. Teachers are seeking 
schools in which they can secure the best training for the least outlay of money. 
As the public normal schools increase in number and efficiency, the weaker private 
normal schools must lose their patronage. The past year has witnessed the demise 
of a number of these weak institutions, and others haye retreated to the rank of 
private secondary schools. The public normal schools now have nearly half of all 
the normal students in the United States. At least 60 per cent of the 84,400 nor- 
mal students were in public institutions. In nearly all the larger cities teachers’ 
training classes are maintained in connection with the public high schools, and in 
many of these classes the training is not inferior to that given in the best State 
normal schools. Of the 7,026 normal students in colleges and universities, several 
hundred are in public institutions. 
As many as 27 colleges and universities have regularly organized departments 
of pedagogy and offer to teachers courses leading to degrees. Courses designed to 
meet the demand for the professional training of teachers are offered in more than 
200 colleges and universitiesin the United States. For the year 1892-93 there were 
5,232 students in 155 such institutions receiving training as teachers. In 1893-94 
there were 5,500 such students in 173 universities and colleges. The number in 
1894-95 had increased to 6,402 students in 192 such institutions. In 1895-96 there 
were 7,026 normal students in 203 colleges and universities. 
The number of graduates from the public normal schools was 8,105, and the num- 
ber from private normal schools was 2,190, so that nearly 17 per cent of the stu- 
dents in public and private normal schools in 1895-96 were graduated at the end of 
5 1867

the year. If we may estimate a like percentage of normal graduates from the 
number of normal students in colleges and universities in public high schools and 
in private high schools and academies, the total number of graduates from the 
84,400 normal students in 1895-96 would reach 14,180. 
PUBLIC NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The statistics of public normal schools are summarized in Tables 1 to 8 in this 
chapter, while the statistics for the individual schoolsare given in detail in Table 19. 
In the 160 public normal schools there were 1,660 teachers instructing normal 
students, as may be seen from Table 1. In other departments maintained by 
these normal schools there were 532 teachers. 
Pennsylvania has 15 public normal schools, New York has 14, Massachusetts 9, 
Alabama 9; Maine, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin have 6 each; West Vi 
ginia, Mississippi, Minnesota, and Missouri have 5 each. Four States were with- 
eut public normal schools at the time the reports were received. A large propor- 
tion of the public normal schools in the Southern States are for the training of col- 
ored teachers. 
Table 2 shows that of the 40,421 students in the normal departments of public 
normal schools 11,922 were men and 28,499 were women. There were 898 stu- 
dents in business courses, 6,610 in other courses of secondary grade, and 14,283 in 
elementary grades. 
The total enrollment in all departments of public normal schools was 61,619, as 
may be seen from Table 8. There were 20,585 children in the model schools not 
necessarily included in the total enrollment. Many schools use their own ele- 
mentary departments as model schools, while others depend upon near-by public 
schools to supply practice classes. 
The 1,329 colored normal students comprise only a small part of the enrollment 
in colored normal schools. A large proportion of the colored students must be 
classed in the elementary grades. 
Table 4 shows the number of normal and other graduates from.the public normal 
schools. There were 8,105 normal graduates—1,762 men and 6,343 women. There 
were 190 graduates from business courses and 583 graduates from other courses. 
The appropriations for the support of public normal schools, by States, counties, 
and cities, for the year 1895-96 aggregated $2,187,875—an increase of $270,500 over 
the previous year. Table 5 shows that the total income of the 160 normal schools 
so far as reported was $2,961,610—an increase of $252,147 over the previous year. 
Of this income the sum of $498,775 was derived from tuition and other fees, $68,904 
from productive funds, and $206,056 from sources not classified. Several schools 
failed to make financial reports. 
Table 6, last column, shows that for the year 1895-96 the public normal schools 
received from States, counties, or cities appropriations for buildings and improve- 
ments amounting to $1,124,834—an increase of $120,901 over the previous year. 
The number of volumes reported in the libraries of 131 public normal schools 
was 391,082. The total value of buildings, grounds, apparatus, etc., reported was 
$16,650,538. The schools received $52,080 in benefactions for the year. Many 
schools declined to state the money value of their endowments, and hence the 
$40,055 under this head in Table 6 does not represent the aggregate endowment of 
the public normal schools of the United States. 
Tables 7 and 8 are recapitulations of public appropriations to public normal 
schools for the past six years. 
  PRIVATE NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
The statistics of private normal schools are summarized in Tables 9 to 14, while 
the statistics of the 169 schools are given in detail in Table 20. 
Table 9 shows that in the 169 private normal schools there were 954 teachers 
instructing normal students—539 men and 415 women. There were 690 teachers for 
students in other departments, making a total of 1,644 teachers employed in the 
169 schools. 
There were 20,777 students in the normal departments of these schools, 10,472 
men and 10,305 women, as shown in Table 10, There were 4,224 students in busi- 
ness courses, 7,937 in other secondary grades, and 15,104 in the elementary grades. 
The total enrollment in all departments was 48,042 as shown in Table 11. These 
schools had 3,481 pupils in their model schools, but a certain proportion of these 
are also included in the elementary grades as summarized in Table 10. In the
-P-A-G-E-911
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS. 1869 
private colored normal schools of the Southern States there were 2,464 students 
pursuing teachers’ training courses—1,076 men and 1,388 women. In the same 
schools there were many more colored pupils in the elementary grades. 
Table 12 shows that there were 2,190 graduates in 1896 from the normal depart- 
ments of the 169 schools—1,035 men and 1,155 women. There were 1,497 graduates 
from the business departments and 1,261 ‘from other departments. 
From Table 13 it is seen that the total income for private normal schools as 
reported to this office for 1895-96 was $969,092. Of this amount the sum of $515,- 
423 was derived from tuition and other fees, and $69,135 from productive funds, 
The sum of $18,872 was received from public appropriations. It is probable that 
the greater part of the unclassified $365,662 was derived from tuition fees, many 
schools having reported only their total income. 
Table 14 summarizes the equipment of private normal schools. The number of 
volumes in the 133 schools reporting libraries was 203,467. The value of grounds, 
buildings, apparatus, etc., reported was $4,421,386. The money value of endown- 
ments possessed by these schools was $2,487,200. The value of benefactions 
received for the year 1895-96 was $254,678. 
     
DISTRIBUTION OF NORMAL STUDENTS. 
Of the total number of students in teachers’ training courses in public normal 
schools it is shown in Table 15 that the males comprised 29.49 per cent and the 
females 70.51 per cent. More than 20 per cent of the students graduated. 
These percentages are contrasted with like percentages for the private normal 
schools. In these the students were divided almost equally between the sexes, 
there being 50.40 per cent males and 49.60 per cent females in the teachers’ training 
courses. In the private normal schools only 10.54 per cent of the normal students 
graduated. 
Table 16 shows that 193 colleges and universities had 7,026 students in normal 
courses, 3,149 males and 3,877 females. Ten other universities maintain pedagog- 
ical departments, but do not report normal students separately. The same table 
shows that 447 public high schools had 8,246 normal students, 2,534 males and 5,712 
females. Private nigh schools and academies to the number of 439 reported 7,930 
normal students, 3,587 males and 4,343 females. Outside of the public and private 
normal schools there were thus reported 23,202 normal students. 
A recapitulation of the totals of preceding table is given in Table 17. It shows 
the number of normal students in each of the five classes of institutions in each 
State and geographical division. 
Table 18 is a list of the colleges and universities reporting students in training 
courses for teachers, showing also the number of normal students in each for the 
past four years. 
Tables 19 and 20 are the tables which give in detail the statistics of the 329 public 
and private normal schools reporting to this office for the scholastic year 1895-96.

CHAPTER XXXIX. 
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION, 1895-96, 
The institutions for higher education in the United States are given in this report 
under the following headings: (1) Universities and colleges for men and for both 
sexes; (2) colleges for women; (3) schools of technology; (4) professional schools 
and departments. In the summarized and detailed tables of these institutions are 
given statistics concerning the entire institutions, and not of the collegiate depart- 
ments only. It is a well-known fact that a large number of the institutions for 
higher education, especially in comparatively recently settled sections of the coun- 
try, maintain preparatory departments for the secondary, and in some cases for 
the elementary education of pupils, as well as normal, business, music, art, and 
other departments of instruction. The number of students in attendance at such 
departments is of course included in the column giving the total number of students 
in attendance at the institution asa whole. In the summarized and detailed tables 
great care has been taken to tabulate separately the number of students in the 
several departments of the institutions, so that it is an easy matter to ascertain 
the number of students that may properly be included under the general head of 
higher education. Counting all of the students in undergraduate and graduate 
departments of the classes of institutions named above, it is found that there were, 
during the year under consideration, 139,611 students in higher education, of which 
number 33,705, or 24.14 per cent, were women. If professional students, including 
students in law, medicine, and theology, are excluded, there remain 97,377 students 
in undergraduate and graduate departments of colleges and schools of technology, 
32,234, or 33.1 per cent, being women. 
The summarized statistics, showing the number of students in higher education 
in each class of institutions, as well as the total number in higher education in all 
of the institutions, are given by States and Territories in the table which follows, 
while the statistics concerning the several classes of institutions may be found 
on the pages following the combined table. 
Summarized statistics of higher education (including students in undergraduate

Public institutions.—In the preceding table are included the number of students 
in all classes of higher institutions, public and private. In order that some idea 
may be formed as to the number of students receiving instruction in undergrad- 
uate and graduate courses of public institutions—that is, institutions founded or 
controlled by the State or municipality—a table has been prepared, giving the 
number of students pursuing such courses at the following-named institutions?

I.—UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES FOR MEN AND FoR BorH SEXES. 
Institutions.—The number of universities and colleges for men and for both 
sexes from which reports were received at the close of the scholastic year 1895-96 
is 484, being three more than were included under this head in 1894-95. The 
increase is, however, not due to.an increase in the number of institutions, but to 
the fact that four institutions heretofore treated as schools of technology are now 
included in the table of universities and colleges. The institutions referred to are 
the Arkansas Industrial University, Fayetteville, Ark.; Florida Agricultural Col- 
lege, Lake City, Fla.; Agricultural and Mechanical College of Kentucky, Lexing- 
ton, Ky., and Lehigh University, South Bethlehem, Pa., all of which maintain 
courses of study leading to the A. B. degree, and have students in such courses. 
The Bureau has learned during the year of the suspension of the following named 
institutions: Napa College, Napa, Cal.; Central College, Enterprise, Kans.; Emi- 
nence College, Eminence, Ky.; Garrard College, Lancaster, Ky.; Olympic Univer- 
sity, Olympia, Wash.; University of Seattle, Seattle, Wash., and West Virginia 
College, Flemington, W. Va. Gale College, at Galesville, Wis., has also suspended 
temporarily. 
Of the 484 institutions, 79 are located in the North Atlantic Division, 70 in the 
South Atlantic Division, 87 in the South Central Division, 201 in the North Central 
Division, and 47 in the Western Division. Of the total number of institutions, 111 
are reported as not being under the control of any particular religious denomination. 
The number of institutions controlled by the several denominations is given in 
Table 1, pages 1926-1931. The table includes not only the number of institutions, 
but it shows the number of professors and students in the undergraduate depart- 
ments and the total amount of the endowments held by such institutions. In order 
that the table might not be too lengthy, the various branches of the several reli- 
gious denominations are combined under one head. The number of nonsectarian 
institutions, as stated above, is 111, with an average endowment of $582,823. 
An examination of the detailed statistics concerning universities and colleges 
discloses the fact that there are 188 such institutions that have no endowment, 54 
have less than $25,000, and only 4 have endowments exceeding $5,000,000. A sum- 
marized statement showing the number of institutions having endowments of 
various amounts is given in Table 2, page 1932, while the classification of institu- 
ED 96 61   
 
-P-A-G-E-964
1922 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
tions according to the number of undergraduate students is shown in Table 3. 
From this table it may be seen that 278 institutions have less than 100 college 
students. 
The number of institutions admitting women to undergraduate courses is 345. 
The Western University of Pennsylvania at Allegheny, Pa., opened its doors to 
women at the beginning of the scholastic year 1893-96. 
Professors and instructors.—The total number of professors and instructors 
employed by the 484 institutions was 12,277; of which number 10,682 are men and 
1,595 are women. The proportion of male and female teachers in the several 
departments, by geographical divisions, is as follows:

The average number of instructors per institution for the entire country was 
25, an increase of 1 instructor per institution over the figures for the preceding 
ear. 
Students.—The total number of students in attendance at the 484 institutions was 
159,372, an increase of 9,433 over the number for the year 1894-95. Of the total 
number of students, 29.5 per cent were in preparatory departments, 43.06 per cent 
in collegiate departments, 2.93 per cent in graduate departments, 15.96 per cent in 
professional departments, and 8.55 per cent in other departments, showing a gain 
of nearly 1 per cent in favor of the undergraduate collegiate departments, and a 
decrease of 1.3 per cent in the proportion of students in preparatory departments. 
The number of instructors and students per institution in the several geographical 
divisions were as follows:

Comparing the number of male and female students for the year under con- 
sideration with the number for the preceding year, it will be found that while the 
proportion of female students in all departments has increased but nine-tenths of 
1 per cent, the proportion of such students in the undergradute collegiate depart- 
ments has increased 1.5 per cent. 
Of the 68,629 students reported in collegiate departments, only 50,918, or 74.2 per 
cent, were reported in courses of study leading to a bachelor’s degree. The dis- 
tribution of students in degree courses was not reported by a number of insti- 
tutions, in some of which it is impossible to determine the degrees for which 
students will apply, owing to the system of ‘‘schools” maintained by such institu- 
tutions. This is the case in a number of the Southern States. An examination of 
the table showing the proportion of studentsin the several degree courses will show 
that more than one-half of the students are pursuing courses of study leading to
-P-A-G-E-965
  
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 1923 
the A. B. degree. The following statement, furnished by the president of Cornell 
University, will show the action concerning degrees taken by that institution; 
“The faculty of Cornell University, at their session held May 22, took action 
providing for a single degree, bachelor of arts, for all students in the courses of 
liberal arts and sciences, irrespective of the studies elected, instead of A. B., Ph. B., 
and B. S., as at present (and B. L., as heretofore). In carrying this into effect 
the faculty cut out all specified requirements, aside from those for entrance, 
excepting military drill and physical culture. Otherwise the four-year course 
will be elective. To realize the change, one must remember that all the work of 
the freshman year of the general course has been ‘required work,’ and most of 
the sophomore; and that, hereby, students at Cornell may henceforth take A. B. on 
completion of a four-year course of study in which there is no Greek or Latin, or, 
of course, conversely, in which there is only Latin or Greek. 
«The three definite sets of entrance requirements which have been built up are 
left intact. .The candidate for admission to the A. B. course must, in addition to 
the preliminary subjects, offer either (a) Greek or Latin, or (b) Latin and advanced 
French or German, or (c) advanced French, advanced German, and one year of 
advanced mathematics, including solid geometry, higher algebra, and plane and 
spherical trigonometry. In a word, the student upon entrance must prove him- 
self well grounded in a systematic high-school course, having certain staple sub- 
jects, and covering part of the ground of an old-fashioned college course. Then, 
when he is admitted, he may take what he chooses, provided only he completes 
satisfactorily the amount prescribed for each term.” 
In areport received from the University of California it is stated that the Ph. B. 
degree is obsolescent and will be discontinued after 1899, 
One of the gratifying features of higher education is the increasing number of 
students who remain at our higher institutions for advanced work, the number 
of graduate students in 1895-96 being 3,756, not including 917 nonresident graduate 
students. Inanumber of the universities and colleges the graduate students have 
formed clubs or associations, and according to the Handbook of Graduate Courses 
there are now twenty-two such organizations, the oldest of which is the Harvard 
Graduate Club, formed in 1889. At a convention of graduate students held at the 
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa., January 3, 1896, the Federation of 
Graduate Clubs was formed, the object being ‘‘to aid the development of grad- 
uate study in America.” One of the principal objects of the federation is to facil- 
itate the migration of students from one institution to another while pursuing 
studies for a higher degree. A step in this direction has been taken by Harvard 
- University, as will be seen by the following statement taken from the report of 
President Eliot for 1895-96: 
“When the graduate school, or department, was first instituted, twenty-five years 
ago, the corporation and overseers were obliged to lay down by standing votes, in 
advance of experience of their own, the rules under which the degrees of master 
of arts, doctor of philosophy, and doctor of science should be conferred. One of 
the rules was that a graduate of any other university than Harvard must spend 
at least two years at Harvard University, after taking his bachelor’s degree, before 
he could be eligible for the degree of doctor of philosophy. Under the same rule, 
the minimum residence for the degree of doctor of science was declared to be three 
years for any graduate of another university. This standing rule set requirements 
for the two doctorates which were not in force with regard to any other of the 
ordinary degrees. The statute on degrees simply prescribes that there shal! be at 
least one year’s residence for any ordinary degree. On the 2d of March last the 
corporation rescinded this requirement of 1871 concerning the minimum residence 
for the degree of doctor of philosophy or doctor of science, and put these two 
degrees on the same footing as regards residence with all the other ordinary 
degrees. The overseers concurred in this action of the corporation. The object 
of this change was not to diminish the time required for procuring the degree of 
doctor. The minimum time for obtaining the doctorate seldom proves sufficient, 
and there is no tendency to reduce the requirements for the doctorates; on the 
contrary. the tendency has been to raise those requirements. Of the 140 persons 
who have obtained the Harvard degree of doctor of philosophy between 1873 and 
1896, only 18 have obtained it in two years after taking the bachelor’s degree. The 
repeal of the standing vote of 1871 is intended to encourage graduate students at 
all the American universities which maintain graduate schools to migrate from 
one university to another during the period of study for the doctorate, taking the 
degree at the university where they reside during the last year. The faculty and 
the governing boards thought it well to do away with the hindrance to migration 
toward Harvard which the rule of 1871 presented. They thought it would be safe 
to leave the requirement concerning residence to the general statute, without 
changing in the least the requirements as to study and attainments.”

  1924 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
In the continual establishment of new fellowships may be found one of the causes 
for the increase in the number of graduate students. In the year under considera- 
tion there were reported 336 fellowships. 
The graduate department of the University of Pennsylvania has been greatly 
strengthened by a gift of $500,000 from Provost Harrison. The purposes of the 
gift are stated to be: ‘‘(1) The establishment of scholarships and fellowships, 
intended solely for men of ability; (2) the increasing the library of the university, 
particularly by the acquisition of works of permanent use and of lasting refer- 
ence, to and by the scholar; (8) the temporary relief from routine work, of profess- 
ors of ability, in order that they may devote themselves to some special and 
graduate work; (4) the securing men of distinction to lecture, and, if the same 
shall be deemed advisable, the securing their residence at the university.” Under 
the provisions of this gift there have been established in the graduate department 
8 scholarships, 14 fellowships, and 5 senior fellowships. The scholarships are open 
to students who have taken a baccalaureate degree in arts or science at the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania, and who have been resident students for at least two 
years prior to graduation. The scholarships are tenable for but one year, and 
entitle the holders to $100 and free tuition in the graduate department of the uni- 
versity for one full academic year. The fellowships have a value of $600, but the 
tuition fee of $100 is deducted and applied to increasing and improving the equip- 
ment of their respective departments. Each of the fellowships is limited to some 
designated department of study. They are granted annually and may be once 
renewed. Applicants ‘‘ must hold a baccalaureate degree of nontechnical charac- 
ter; must have pursued graduate work successfully for at least one year in resi- 
dence at an acceptable college or university; must have a good reading knowledge 
of French and German, and must not already have taken the doctor’s degree.” 
Feliows must be candidates for the Ph. D. degree and must devote their entire 
time to the prosecution of their studies in residence at the university. The five 
senior fellowships are not designated by subjects. ‘‘They are open only to men 
who have taken the Ph. D. degree at the University of Pennsylvania. <A senior 
fellow will be required to devote himself to some work of original research in the 
line of his specified subject. He will also do such teaching or lecturing in his 
subject as may from time to time be required by the head of his department, to a 
maximum of four hours a week. Residence is imperative.” 
Degrees.—The total number of degrees, excluding degrees in law, medicine, and 
theology, granted to students during the year 1895-96 was 10,761, of which num- 
ber 8,840 were conferred on men and 1,921 on women. The number of, different 
kinds of degrees conferred may be found in Tables 9 and 10. 
The number of honorary degrees reported for the year was 755, being less by 140 
than the number for the preceding year. The number of doctorates conferred 
was 506, which is 120 less than were conferred in 1894-95. The degree of doctor 
of philosophy was conferred as an honorary degree by 16 institutions. 
Property.—The value of all the property owned by universities and colleges is 
reported at $243,655,868, of which amount $109,562,433 are reported as endowment 
funds, while the remainder represents the value of grounds, buildings, and appa- 
ratus used for instruction purposes by the institutions. The proportion of prop- 
erty held by the institutions of the several divisions is shown in the following 
tabular statement:

Western Division.... 9.7 1.8 3.8 4.8 7.2 8.4 5.2   
Benefactions.—The total money value of gifts and bequests reported by these 
institutions was $8,342,728, of which amount $2,200,000 was received by the Uni- 
versity of Chicago. 
Income.—The total income from all sources, excluding benefactions, was 
$17,918,174, an increase of more than $1,000,000 over the income for the preceding 
ear. Although the amount of productive funds was over $7,000,000 greater than 
in 1894-95, the income from productive funds was less by almost $100,000, This was 
caused, undoubtedly, by the financial stringency through which the country is
-P-A-G-E-967

passing, and by a lowering of the rate of interest on investments. The proportion 
of income derived from the various sources by the institutions of the several 
divisions is as follows:

North Central Division. 3.8 12.0 
Western Division - 13.8 18.5 
  
  Comparing the figures in the above tabular statement with the figures for the 
preceding year, it will be found that there is a decrease of 2.4 per cent in the pro- 
portion of income derived from productive funds. The decrease is not limited to 
any particular section of the country, but is found in all of the geographical divi- 
sions. The proportion of income derived from tuition fees is less by one-half of 1 
er cent than it was in 1894-95. The decrease in these two sources of income is, 
owever, balanced by an increase of 2.9 per cent in the proportion of income derived 
from State, municipal, and national appropriations, the income from such sources 
amounting to $3,676,481. 2

  COLLEGES FOR WOMEN. 1945 
II.—COLLEGES FOR WOMEN, 
DIVISION A. ’ 
Institutions.—The number of institutions included in Division A for the year 
1895-96 is 14, the decrease of one being due to the omission of the Cleveland Col- 
lege for Women, the statistics of which are included in the report of the Western 
Reserve University. This action was taken to avoid duplication of statistics. 
Professors and instructors.—The number of professors and instructors in the 14 
institutions was 514, an average of about 37 instructors to each institution. Of 
the total number 221 are men and 293 women. But 20 instructors, all women, 
were employed in the preparatory departments. 
Students.—There were enrolled in these institutions 4,328 students, of which 
number 3,718 were in regular collegiate departments, 192 were pursuing post- 
graduate studies, and but 254 were in preparatory departments. Of the students 
reported in undergraduate degree courses, 88.96 per cent were pursuing. courses 
leading to the A. B. degree, 7.92 per cent to the B. L. degree, and 3.12 per cent to 
the B.S. degree. The number of students in pedagogical courses was 78. Ten of 
the 14 institutions reported the classes of institutions in which their freshman 
students were prepared for college. From the statistics given it is found that 47.1 
per cent were prepared in public high schools, 40 per cent in private preparatory 
schools, 10.43 per cent in preparatory departments of colleges, and 2.47 per cent 
by private study. 
Degrees.—The number of degrees conferred was 639, as follows: 459 A. B., 27 
B.S., 105 B. L., 40 A. M., 5 Ph. D., and 3 Mus. B. Allof the Ph. D. degrees were 
conferred by Bryn Mawr College. No honorary degrees were conferred by these 
institutions. 
Property.—The total value of all property reported is $10,460,052, of which 
amount $4,412,537 is productive endowment and the remainder is the value of the 
property used for instruction purposes. The number of fellowships owned by 
these institutions is 16, of which number 14 are held by Bryn Mawr College. 
Income.—An examination of Table 6, page 1948, will show that the students of 
these institutions pay a much larger proportion of the expenses of the institutions 
than do the students of colleges for men and coeducational colleges. In the last 
two classes of institutions the tuition fees paid by students amount to but 87.3 
per cent of the total income, while in the 14 colleges for women under considera- 
tion the tuition fees are 59.1 per cent of the income. These institutions receive 
neither State nor municipal aid. The benefactions for the year amounted to 
$339,545. 
DIVISION B. 
Institutions.—The number of institutions from which statistics were received is 
148. Two institutions—Pittsburg Female College, Pittsburg, Pa., and Cumber- 
land Female College, McMinnville, Tenn.—were reported during the year as hay- 
ing suspended operation. Of the total number of institutions, 117 are located in 
the Southern section of the country. ‘ 
Professors.—The number of teachers employed was 2,038, of which number but 
457 were men. The average number of teachers per institution was about 14. 
Students.—There were reported by these institutions 20,335 students, of whom 
1,581 graduated or completed their studies during the year. Of the total num- 
ber of students, 10,321 were reported as collegiate students, 4,891 as preparatory 
students, and 1,937as elementary students. Only 4,689 students were reported in 
courses of study leading to some bachelor’s degree; 8,272 students were reported in 
music, and 2,451 in art. 
Degrees.—While it was reported that 1,581 students had graduated, there were 
conferred but 944 degrees, including 147 degrees in music and art. There were 
conferred but two honorary degrees—one A. M. and one D. D. 
Property.—The total value of all property owned by these institutions is 
$10,416,014, an average of $70,378 per institution. Only 25 of the institutions 
report endowment funds, the total amounting to $896,021, showing that these insti- 
tutions must depend for existence almost entirely on the tuition and other fees 
paid by their students. 
Income.—Receipts from tuition fees form 83.9 per cent of the total income of 
$2,267,050, and receipts from ‘‘ other sources,” including, as a rule, profit on board- 
ers, comprise 11.6 per cent of the income, leaving 4.5 per cent to be made up of 
State appropriations and income from endowment funds. Four institutions 
received aid from their States during the year, .The benefactions to these insti- 
tutions amounted to $271,700.

III.—ScHooits or TECHNOLOGY. 
Institutions.—The number of institutions included under schools of technology 
is 48, three less than the preceding year. Four institutions heretofore classed as 
schools of technology have been transferred to the table of universities and col- 
leges, while one new institution, the New Mexico School of Mines, has been added, 
making a net decrease of three institutions, 
Professors and instructors.—The total number, of professors and instructors 
reported was 1,118, of which number 1,041, or 93.1 per cent, taught in the regular 
collegiate departments. There were but 80 women employed in these institutions 
as teachers. The proportion of instructors in the several departments as com- 
pared with the proportion of institutions was as follows:

    In many of the schools of technology the only degree conferred for the comple- 
tion of an undergraduate course of study is that of bachelor of science, technical 
degrees in many instances being conferred only on the completion of graduate 
courses. Of the number of students reported in degree courses, 76.48 per cent. 
were reported in courses of study leading to the B. S. degree, 
The question asking for the classes of institutions in which freshmen were pre- 
pared was answered by 22 institutions. Reference to Table 3 will show that 70.57 
per cent of the freshmen reported upon were prepared in public high schools, a 
much larger proportion than are prepared for universities and colleges by this 
class of institutions. 
Degrees.—The total number of degrees conferred by the schools of technology 
is 1,005, of which number 911 were conferred on men and 94 on women. Five 
honorary degrees were conferred by 3 institutions: 1 M. S. by the Colorado Agri- 
cultural College, 1 M. E., 1 Ph. M., and 1 Sc. D. by the Maine College of Agricul- 
ture and the Mechanic Arts, and 1 E. D. by Stevens Institute of Technology. 
Property.—The total value of all property was reported at $24,105,242, of which 
amount $10,384,293 consists of productive endowment, the remainder being the 
value of the material equipment. The proportion of property held by the institu- 
tions of the several geographical divisions was as follows:

University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.—The following statement concerning the 
university extension work of the University of Chicago was furnished by Mr. 
Newman Miller, correspondence-study secretary: 
Along with many other features in connection with the University of Chicago, 
the idea of university extension has from the first played a very important part in 
its organization, and when the plan of this institution was formulated the uni- 
versity extension department was one of the prominent features, and the work 
received recognition in the shape of a separate division onan equal standing with the 
other divisions of the institution. In so doing, the university was the first institu- 
tion in this country to recognize university extension in all its forms as an integral 
part in its organization. All nonresident work in connection with the university 
is done through this division, and three methods of work are recognized; First,

   STATISTICS OF UNIVERSITY EXTENSION. 2013 
lecture-study courses given in Illinois and adjacent States; second, classes eed 
in Chicago and its immediate suburbs; third, correspondence courses. 
The officers in charge of the work are as follows: Prof. Edmund J. J: ames, 
director, university extension division; Mr. Walter A. Payne, lecture-study secre- 
tary; Mr. Ira W. Howerth, class-study secretary; Mr. Newman Miller, corre- 
spondence-study secretary. 
In previous years the work of the class—and correspondence—study departments 
has not been recognized and therefore a complete summary of the work from the 
beginning is given in the accompanying pages. 
In the lecture-study department a large variety of courses are offered in the fol- 
lowing departments: Philosophy, pedagogy, political science, history, sociology, 
anthropology, comparative religion, the Semitic languages and literatures, romance 
languages and literatures, Germanic languages and literatures, the English lan- 
guage and literature, biblical literature in English, physics, chemistry, geology, 
zoology, neurology, botany, music, and art. Aside from this, courses on litera- 
ture and history are offered in the French, German, and Norwegian languages, 
‘The work of the department for the past year is summarized as follows:

    The work of the correspondence-study department of the University of Chicago 
has always been maintained upon an equal footing with that of the university 
roper. This close relation has deprived the work of what might be called popu- 
arity, and for this reason the enrollment has: never been as large as might be 
expected for work of this kind. The following statistical table will be of interest 
with reference to the development of the work in connection with the University 
of Chicago for the past four years: 
  
1892-93. | 1893-94, | 1894-95. | 1895-96. 
  
        Number of courses in progress - 28 29 84 87 
Number of instructors engaged 13 Ww aT 44 
Number of students not matriculate: 520 178 188 
Number of students regularly matriculate 61 158 202 
  
It will be noticed from the above table that the number of matriculated students 
has gradually increased, while the number of those not matriculated has gradually 
decreased. When the work of the correspondence-study department was inaugu- 
rated, there was a very large number,of nonmatriculated students enrolled in 
divinity subjects, especially in the Semitic languages and literatures. The much 
better advantages now afforded for residence study along these lines has served to 
peas decrease the number who desire this work by the correspondence method. 
‘he persons most interested in the work have been teachers and ministers of the 
gospel, and a large majority of the students have been classed as ‘‘ special.” 
During the past year 87 courses, representing 680 minors, have been in progress in 
18 different departments. The total yearly enrollment has been 426. 
CLASS-STUDY DEPARTMENT. 
One method of extending university instruction, obviously the best method 
when it can be employed, is that of organizing classes outside of the university to 
pursue the same lines of study that are followed within its walls. The great 
center of population in which the University of Chicago was located, presented a 
favorable opportunity for the practice of this method of carrying higher educa- 
tion to thepeople. This opportunity has not been neglected. From the beginning
-P-A-G-E-1059
  
STATISTICS OF UNIVERSITY EXTENSION.   
2017 
the university has sought to form in convenient parts of the city and in suburban 
towns Saturday and evening classes, in which persons whose occupations or cir- 
cumstances prevented their matriculation as resident students might still enjoy 
the benefits of university instruction. 
Class instruction is offered in the following departments: Philosophy, pedagogy, 
political economy, political science, history, sociology, sanitary and domestic sci- 
ence, Latin, French, New Testament language and literature, Italian, English, 
chemistry, biology, botany, physiology, zoology, and archeology. The working 
terms of this branch of the work correspond almost exactly to the terms of the 
public-school year.

A glance at the first table shows that the number of classes, as well as the num- 
ber of students, has gradually increased from year to year. The total number 
of students enrolled during the year 1895-96 compares favorably with the number 
of students in residence at any time. The probability that in a few more years 
nonresident students will outnumber those in actual attendance, will strike many 
as an interesting proof of the importance of the work. 
From the second table it may be observed that the most popular subjects, esti- 
mated by classes, have been Latin, English, mathematics, history, and political 
economy, in the order named. If estimated by actual attendance, English takes 
the lead, with Latin second and history third. History, English, Latin, French, 
and mathematics are the only subjects for which there has been a continual 
demand. The total number of classes for the four years is 235, with a total 
attendance of 2,423.

CHAPTER XL. 
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
There were 144 schools of theology, with 869 instructors and 8,017 students, a 
variation of only 33 from the number of students in attendance during the pre- 
ceding year. Of the students in attendance, 2,953, or 36.8 per cent, had received 
the degree of A. B. or B.S. Theological schools reported grounds and buildings 
valued at $12,648,216, and endowment funds to the amount of $17,969,906. Theo- 
logical libraries contained 1,204,889 volumes. 
Law schools continue to show a rapid increase in the number of students in 
attendance, the 73 schools having an enrollment during 1895-96 of 9,780 students, 
an increase of 830 over the previous year. In addition to its regular law depart- 
ment, and not included in the statistics of law schools, the New York University 
has a special course of law lectures to women, which had an attendance of 80 in 
1895-96, of whom 47 received the certificate of completion of the course. These 
lectures are designed to meet the wants of business women who ‘‘ desire familiarity 
with the existing law, either for practical purposes, to assist their judgment as 
litigants, witnesses, and custodians of trust estates, or as a higher study for their 
mental development. They also furnish preparation for entrance upon the pro- 
fessional study of the law, with a view to active practice at the bar.” 
There were 116 regular schools of medicine, 20 homeopathic, 8 eclectic, 2 physio- 
medical, and9 graduate. Students in regular schools lacked but one of numbering 
20,000; homeopathic numbered 1,956, and eclectic 634, The proportion of students 
graduating i in medicine was smaller than in any of the other classes, excepting 
theology, viz., medicine 22 per cent, law 30 per cent, dentistry 24 per cent, and 
pharmacy 28 per cent. 
The North Atlantic and Western States had exactly the same proportion of 
students of regular schools of medicine and of homeopathic students, but the 
North Central ‘States had a much larger proportion of homeopathic and eclectic 
students than of regular students. On the contrary, both the South Central and 
South Atlantic States had a much smaller proportion of homeopathic and eclectic 
students. In other words, homeopathy and eclecticism have their strongest foot- 
hold in the North Central States, and are weakest in the Southern States. These 
facts are clearly set forth in the following table: 
Percentage of students of different schools of medicine in each section.

The number of dental students in 1895-96 showed an increase of more than 1,000 
over the number in 1894-95, viz, 6,899 in 1895-96 and_5,347 in 1894-95. Pharma- 
ceutical students numbered 3, 873, With a difference of pale 14 from the number in 
1894-95. The course of training in schools for nurses heretofore occupied two 
years as a rule, but there is a tendency now to lengthen the time to three years, 
fifteen schools reporting courses of three years in this report. Bet

  CHAPTER XLI. 
COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS. 
Returns from 398 commercial and business schools are tabulated in this report. 
Schools failing to report for two years in succession are dropped from thelist. In 
the 398 business schools represented in the report for 1895-96 there were 1,913 
instructors and 80,662 students. The total number of graduates in the commer- 
cial course was 10,481 and in the amanuensis course 8,836. The number of stu- 
dents in the day schools in all the geographical divisions was largely in excess of 
the number in the evening schools. The total number of students reported in the 
day schools was 64,901 and in the evening schools 15,911. It will be seen by these 
figures that the day schools contain nearly four times as many students as the 
evening schools report. The total number of students in the commercial course 
reported by the 398 schools was 37,630—males 29,869 and females 7,761. The total 
number of students in the amanuensis course was 19,250—males 8,312 and females 
10,938. In the English course 11,870 students were reported—males 8,630 and 
females 3,240. In telegraphy there were 1,434—males 1,164 and females 270. 
In addition to the 37,630 students in the regular commercial courses of business 
schools, there were 51,182 commercial students in universities and colleges, in nor- 
mal schools, in private high schools and academies, and in public high schools. 
This was an increase of 7,954 students in the above-named schools since the report 
of this Bureau for 1894-95. (See the statistical summary on the two succeeding 
pages. ) 
E The North Atlantic Division reported 116 schools, with a total of 639 instructors 
7,487 students. There were 3,963 graduates in the commercial course and 
,526 in the amanuensis course. The number of male students was 18,259 and 
the number of female students 9,228. The day schools reported 20,667 and the 
evening schools 6,790. The total number of students in the commercial coursé 
was 10,493—males 7,911 and females 2,582. The total number of students in the 
amanuensis course was 5,609—males 2,181 and females 3,428. In the English

the amanuensis course there were 733 male students and 735 female students; in 
the English course, males 883 and females 186; in telegraphy, males 175 and 
females 42. 
The North Central Division reports 47 per cent of the total number of commer-

New Orleans Exposition, 1884-85, pp. 468-470, 775-781. 
The estimated number of persons 5 to 18 years of age in the sixteen Southern 
States and the District of Columbia for the scholastic year 1895-96 was 8,562,970. 
Of this number 5,768,680 were white and 2,794,290 were colored. The total enroll- 
ment in the public schools of the South was 5,291,013, the enrollment in the white 
schools being 3,861,300, or 66.93 per cent of the white children of school age, and 
the enrollment in the colored schools 1,429,713, or 51.16 per cent of the colored 
children of school age. While the colored children constitute 32.63 per cent of 
the school population of the South, they make but 27 per cent of the school enroll- 
ment. In the District of Columbia and in Kentucky the per cent of colored 
children enrolled is higher than for the white children. In Alabama and South Car- 
olina the per cent of attendance is higher for the colored than for white children, 
For the entire South the average daily attendance was 66.28 per cent of the enroll- 
ment for the white children and 62.04 per cent of the enrollment for the colored 
children. These statistics for each of the sixteen Southern States and the District 
of Columbia are given in Table 1 on the following page. i 
The total expenditure for public schools in the South for 1895-96 was $30,729,819. 
In only one or two States are separate accounts kept of the expenditure of money 
for the colored schools, but at alow estimation the cost of public schools for the 
colored race for 1895-96 was not less than $6,500,000. Table 2 shows that from 
1870 to 1896 the cost of public schools in the South was $483,777,467. Between 
$90,000,000 and $95,000,000 of this sum must have been expended for the education 
of the colored children. The same table shows the enrollment in the white and 
colored schools for each year, and also the total expenditure for each year from 
1870-71 to 1895-96.   
  
SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION, 
For the year 1895-96 this Bureau received reports from 178 schools for the second- 
ary and higher education of the coloredrace. Three of these schools are in Penn- 
sylvania, two in Ohio, two in Indiana, one in Illinois, and one in New Jersey. All 
the others are within the boundaries of the former slave States. Table 3 shows 
the number of these schools in each State and the number of teachers and stu- 
dents for each State. The total enrollment in these 178 schools was 40,127. The 
number in the elementary grades was 25,092, in the secondary 13,563, and in the 
collegiate grades 1,455. The number of teachers employed was 1,626, The statis- 
tics of these schools are given in detail in Tables 9 and 10.

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 2083 
Table 4 shows that in the 178 schools there were 1,494 students in classical 
courses, 1,345 in scientific courses, 9,189 in English courses, and. 398 in business 
courses. Table 5-shows that 4,672 students were in normal courses. There were 
826 graduates from high school courses, 966 from normal courses, and 161 from 
collegiate courses. 
Table 6 is an exhibit of, the number of students in professional courses in the 
colored schools. The total number in professional courses was 1,319, only 126 of 
these being females. There were 703 students and 76 graduates in schools and de- 
partments of theology, 124 students and 20 graduates in law, 286 students and 30 
graduates in medicine, 82 students and 6 graduates in dentistry, 48 students and 
18 graduates in pharmacy, and 126 students and 40 graduates in nurse training. 
Table 7 is a summary of the statistics of industrial training in the 178 colored 
schools. The number receiving industrial training was 12,341, the number of 
males being 4,476 and of females 7,865. The table shows that the number being 
trained in farm and garden work was 1,098, in carpentry 1,821, in bricklaying 254, 
in plastering 165, in painting 257, in tin and sheet-metal work 126, in forging 327,in 
machine-shop work 223, in shoemaking 165, in printing 565, in sewing 6,302, in 
cooking 2,455, and in other trades not named 1,677. The details of the statistics of 
industrial training are given in Table 10. ‘ 
The financial statistics of the colored schools of secondary and higher grade are 
summarized in Table 8. These schools received in benefactions during the scho- 
lastic year 1895-96 the sum of $323,718. The income of these schools aggregated 
$1,117,569. Of this amount the sum of $289,845 was derived from public funds, 
$92,297 from productive funds, and $124,481 from tuition fees. The sources of the 
unclassified income of $610,946 are uncertain. Many schools reported only total 
incomes for 1895-96. . 
INTERVIEWS WITH LEADING EDUCATORS OF THE COLORED RACE. 
Interviews with bishops of the African Methodist Church and with leading edu- 
cators of the colored race were printed in the New Orleans Times-Democrat of 
January 24, 1897, Those who read,in the Report of the United States Commis- 
sioner of Education for 1894-95, the two chapters on the Education of the Colored 
Race will be interested in these interviews. The Times-Democrat made the fol- 
lowing editorial comment: 
“EDUCATION FOR THE NEGRO. 
«“‘We publish elsewhere interviews with the presidents of the several colored 
colleges of this city, the bishops of the African Methodist Church now in New 
Orleans, and others interested in the education of the colored race, upon a sub- 
ject, than which there is none more important before the South and the country 
to-day. It is a part—and the most important part—of the great negro problem of 
the United States. What is better for the education of the negro—a classical edu- 
cation or an industrial and mechanical education? Shall we turn his ambition in 
the direction of the learned professions rather than toward the industries? 
“When we consider that there are 8,000,000 negroes in this country, that they 
constitute one-ninth of its population, and in several of the Southern States are in 
a majority, we can form some idea of the importance of this matter of educating 
them and making them useful and valuable citizens. 
“A great deal of work has been done already. Over $80,000,000 have been ex- 
pended on colored schools and colleges since 1876 alone. Thirty-three years have 
passed since the emancipation proclamation—a full generation—and we ought by 
this time to gather some fruit from the millions expended on the education of the 
negro. What do the results show—that a classical education or an industrial or 
mechanical one is better for the present condition and needs of the negro and for 
the South? ‘ 
“The two sides of the case are well stated by Prof. Booker T. Washington, presi- 
dent of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, of Alabama, on the one 
hand, and President Edward Cushing Mitchell, of Leland University, in this city, 
on the other. 
‘President Mitchell takes a very decided stand against simple industrial educa- 
tion. He calls attention to the fact that the Northern colleges, which in many cases 
began with manual labor schools, have abandoned this appendage to their curric- 
ulum. ‘Ought we to insist,’ he asks, ‘upon putting a yoke upon the necks of our 
brethren in black which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear?’ And he 
calls attention to the fact that the report of the Bureau of Education for 1889-90 
shows that the graduates of 17 colored schools in which industrial instruction is

  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE, 2085 
given in carpentering, farming, shoemaking, etc., have generally drifted off into the 
professions. Out of 1,243 graduates of these schools 693 are teachers, 117 ministers, 
163 physicians, 116 lawyers, while only 12 are farmers, and 5 following mechanical 
pursuits (2 printers, 1 carpenter, and 2 unclassified). From these facts, President 
Mitchell reaches the conclusion that industrial education is not what the negro 
needs, but the same higher or classical education provided for the whites. 
“We think President Mitchell altogether wrong in his conclusions. It is the 
same mistake that was made when the suffrage was given the negro. Those who 
gave it so hastily and prematurely imagined that the fifteenth amendment would 
immediately make the negro a valuable citizen and endow him with all the polit- 
ical experience which it has taken the white race centuries—and centuries of 
struggle, too—to secure. There could have been no more unfortunate mistake for 
the negro and the South. The saturnalia that prevailed between 1868 and 1872 in 
consequence of conferring of the franchise on a people not yet fitted for it not only 
cost the South millions of dollars and thousands of lives, but did-the negro race a 
serious injustice, setting back its civilization, arousing old prejudices, and causing 
even its most ardent friends to doubt its ability for the higher development and 
civilization. 
“Mr. Mitchell would have us do in education what was attempted in politics, 
but failed. He himself recognizes that the white race began with industrial 
schools, and as it advanced, steadily elevated its schools, widened its curriculum, 
and raised the standard of education. He would have the negro at the very start 
try to do what the whites have taken centuries to reach. He would begin with 
classical education, a policy which will cause only discontent and failure. It is 
not what we should offer a race only just struggling to the front, steeped in igno- 
rance, the fruit of centuries of slavery. If it were proposed to establish a dozen 
great universities like Oxford and Cambridge in the heart of Africa, as a means 
of checking cannibalism and raising and developing the natives, and bringing 
them civilization and prosperity, it would cause a national protest as a pure 
waste of money, and yet this would be only an exaggeration of President Mitchell’s 
. ESRD HOR 
“His statistics, which are the strongest point of his argument, really prove 
nothing. It may be true that a large proportion of the negroes educated in the - 
colored colleges have drifted into the professions. It is equally true that a con- 
siderable proportion of them drifted into politics in 1868-1872; but we must not con- 
clude from this that what the negro wants is a political instead of an industrial 
education. Wesee that among the college graduates there are ten ministers to 
every one farmer. We will not accept this as proof that what the negroes need is 
more theology. There are a thousand negroes engaged in farming for every one 
who enters the church, and if the farmers were only better taught how tocultivate 
their lands they would be better off materially and morally. The poverty and 
the ignorance of the negro race are keeping up a sick rate, a death rate, and a 
prison rate which are preventing that advance it would otherwise make. 
“Ttis natural that half the graduates of the colored normal and industrial schools 
should becometeachers. In providing for a race whose education has been so long 
neglected, the first graduates will naturally devote themselves to teaching. Presi- 
dent Mitchell says that in giving an industrial education to a negro you help only 
the individual. His own statistics disprove this, for so far a majority of these 
graduates have devoted themselves to scattering among the race the information 
which they themselves have gained. The industrial schools are teaching not a few 
negroes better work, but through them the entire colored race. 
“In marked contrast are the views of Prof. Booker T. Washington, president of 
the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, one of the leading representatives 
of his race, certainly in the field of education. Professor Washington has had 
the best opportunities of studying the question thoroughly and practically. The 
institute over which he presides has done good work for the negro, and its gradu- 
ates have carried the lessons learned there throughout the South. One of its best 
fruits is the conference now held each year at Tuskegee of representatives of the 
negro race from all parts of the Union to discuss questions affecting its interests. 
***Tam convinced,’ says Professor Washington, ‘that whether the negro receives 
much or little education, whether it be called high or low, we have reached the 
point inour development where a large proportion of those who are being educated 
should, while they are receiving their education or after they have received it, be 
taught to connect their education with some industrial pursuit.’ 
‘Professor Washington thinks, as we do, that in the present condition of the 
negro, the first thing for him to learn is how to secure an independent position in 
the industrial world, how to work and to work intelligently. If the colored col- 
leges drop industrial education and turn their attention solely to graduating theo- 
logians, lawyers, etc., he sees that the negro will very soon be crowded out of

the industries in the South, as he already is inthe North. Evenin slavery he was 
taught carpentering, blacksmithing, and kindred mechanicaltrades. If he abandon 
this field, he will close the avenues of employment to himself and drift into a con- 
dition of uselessness. It will be a bad thing for the race if it allows itself to be 
driven out of every industry upon which its living depends, and is satisfied with 
book learning alone, in which it is naturally at a great disadvantage in competi- 
tion with the whites, if for no other reason because the latter has had the advan- 
tage of centuries of schooling. It will be giving up the field where, because of his 
strength, the negro can compete most successfully for a field where he is at the 
greatest disadvantage. 
“«Professor Washington notes sadly the tendency of the negroes to neglect the 
very industry by which nine-tenths of them make their living—farming. To the 
advocates of ‘the higher education, it is hardly worth while to teach the negro 
how to farm intelligently and profitably, although thousands of white youths are 
learning scientific agriculture: and it is actually pointed to with pride instead of 
sorrow that twenty negroes who receive a better education follow theology and 
law for one who follows agriculture, the profession with which his race has been 
connected for all time. 
“We are glad to see that nearly all the colored men interviewed by us, and par- 
ticularly those of Southern birth, agree with Professor Washington that what 
their race needs most is industrial education, rather than simple book learning. 
“They are right, and it is an auspicious sign to see themrecognizing the potency 
of industry, and seeing the right road for the elevation of their race. The philan- 
thropy of the North has given millions of dollars to the education of the colored. 
race. The spirit of justice of the Southern people has given ten times as much. 
The negroes constitute so large a proportion of the population of the South that 
their prosperity and morality, even their health, affect the entire body politic. 
It is in negro sections of our cities where the first rules of sanitation are defied 
that are bred the diseases which sweep through the white residential districts and 
carry off thousands—victims of negro ignorance and neglect; and the moral atmos- 
phere of these negro Ghettos more or less permeates the whole community. 
“4 few months ago the American Economic Association issued among its publi- 
cations, The Race Traits and Tendencies of the American Negro, by Frederick~ 
L. Hoffman, F.S.S., statistician of the Prudential Insurance Company of America. 
It is the best book yet issued on the subject, the fruit of years of close study of the 
subject and absolutely free of bias; yet the conclusion Mr. Hoffman reached was: 
“Instead of making the race more independent, modern educational and philan- 
thropic efforts have succeeded in making it even more dependent on the white race 
at the present time than it was previous to education. It remains to be seen how 
far a knowledge of the facts about its own diminishing vitality, low state of 
morality, and economic efficiency will stimulate the race in adopting a higher 
standard. Unless a change takes place, a scheme that will strike at the funda- 
mental errors that underlie the conduct of the higher race toward the lower, the 
gradual extinction (of the negro) is only a question of time.’ § 
“Unless the negro race can make a proper place for itself, unless it can find 
work to do for which it is fitted, it will meet, Mr. Hoffman predicts, the same fate 
as every other colored race coming into conflict with the Anglo-Saxon—extinction. 
The preachers and the lawyers and the colored editors will not prevent this, but 
those who render the negroes industrially independent, find them work to do, 
improve their material condition, and with that improvement bring about higher 
spirit of self-confidence and morality. 
“The child must be taught to stand before it tries running. The negro is in 
his infancy asa freeman. He should have solid foundations of education first, 
and open the industries to his race, instead of depending too much on the higher 
classical education. There has been a disposition of late by many to declare that 
education is doing the negro more harm than good. The Senate Labor Committee 
found a number of witnesses to testify to that effect. The Chattanooga Trades- 
man, after a searching inquiry of the employers of colored labor, learned from 
them that education generally detracted from a negro’s efficiency. We know to 
the contrary from the experience of every race that this can not be so, and is no 
more true of the negro than of the white man. It is not education that is causing 
any lack of efficiency, but the kind of education. It should, for the present at 
least. be mainly industrial, intended to advance the condition of the negro, to 
assure him work, and to improve his material status. Whether it will be well 
afterwards to establish higher universities for the colored race, we may leave to 
time to determine. We should give him a chance now to improve and raise him- 
self. To give him a classical education in his present condition is like giving a 
stone to him who asks for bread.

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 2089 
“The Times-Democrat gives below interviews with the bishops of the African 
Methodist Church, now in this city, with the presidents of the several colored col- 
leges in New Orleans, the president of the Tuskegee (Ala.) Normal and Industrial 
Institute, and with a number of the more prominent representative colored men 
of New Orleans interested in the matter of education. ‘The Times-Democrat has 
sought in these interviews to shed some light on the matter of the education of 
the negro—a subject that is attracting great attention just now, and is being 
earnestly and extensively discussed pro and con. 
“The questions propounded to the presidents of the several colored colleges were 
as follows: 
“1, How many pupils do you graduate each year? 
“2, What are these young men and women fitted for when they leave your 
institutions? 
“3, Have you any knowledge of what becomes of them after leaving your care? 
“4, Can you make any estimate as to what percentage of them secure useful 
and lucrative occupations? 
“5, What is your candid opinion, after years of experience, as to the advisa- 
pility of the higher education of the negro, i. e., a classical education, as opposed 
to an industrial or mechanical education? 
“The last question, it will be seen, is the most important, and is the one upon 
which light is most sought. A very large sum of money is being expended each 
year on the education of the negro, and large educational funds are being created 
for their benefit. It is, therefore, important to know what is being accomplished 
in the way of his education, and what system is yielding the best fruit. Are 
those colleges which confine themselves mainly to a classical education doing the 
most good, or those mainly employed in turning the colored youth to industrial 
pursuits? A full and complete answer to this question will probably largely influ- 
ence future donations. It is to secure such an answer that the Times-Democrat 
has interviewed those who, from their position as the heads of leading colored col- 
leges or from their association with or knowledge of the negro, are best able to 
speak authoritatively on this matter.

“To the Editor of the Times-Democrat: 
“The Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute graduates from forty to fifty- 
five young men and women each year from its industrial and literature depart- 
ments. When these men and women graduate they are fitted to become teachers 
in the public schools or to work at various trades or industries, such as carpentry, 
wheelwrighting, blacksmithing, foundry work, machinists, tinsmiths, harness 
making, shoemaking, printing, farming, dairying, horticulture, stock raising, 
house painting, brick making, brick masonry, plastering, mattress making, tailor- 
ing, sewing, millinery work, laundering, general housekeeping, cooking, and 
nursing. 
“We have a definite plan of keeping closely up with the work accomplished by 
our graduates after they leave us. In fact, one teacher devotes a large portion of 
his time to the work of visiting our graduates and in keeping up in various ways 
with the work done by them. It is safe in saying at least 90 per cent of those who 
graduate from this institution secure useful and lucrative positions. In fact, 
most of them are usually engaged before they graduate. Especially is this true 
of those who graduate from our various industrial departments. So great is the 
demand from all parts of the South for our graduates who understand the various 
industrial pursuits, especially agriculture, dairying, carpentry, etc., that we can 
not begin to supply this demand. Only this week we received applications from 
two prominent white men, one in Florida and another in Alabama, for men to take 
charge of large modern dairy establishments. 
“T have never been opposed to what is called the higher education of the negro, 
but after years of experience I am convinced that, whether the negro receives 
much or little education, whether it be called high or low, we have reached the 
point in our development where a larger proportion of those who are educated 
should, while they are receiving their education or after they have received it, be 
taught to connect their education with some industrial pursuit. To the masses 
of the negroes in our present condition intellectual training means little except as 
the negro can use that education along industrial lines in securing for himself an 
independent position in the industrial world. There should be a more vital and 
practical connection between the negro’s educated brain and his opportunity for

earning an independent living. I. do-not mean to say that all educated colored 
men should have industrial training, for we need colored men in the professions. 
By reason of our failure to give more attention to industrial development we are 
running the risk of losing the most valuable thing which we got out of slavery. 
American slavery, as bad as it was, made the Southern white men do business 
with the negro fortwo hundred and fifty years. If a white man wanted a house 
built or a suit of clothes made during slavery, he consulted a negro about the build- 
ing of that house or the making of those clothes. Thus the two races for two 
hundred and fifty years: were brought into business contact, which left the negro 
at the close of the war in possession of all the skilled labor, as well as other lines 
of industry in the South. 
“The question which is now pressing upon us moreand more each year is, ‘Can 
we hold on to this skilled labor in the face of a large number of men and women 
of other races from Europe and from the North and West who are continually 
coming into the South?* These foreigners are not only educated in their brains, 
but are skilled in their hands. In other words, they have brains coupled -with 
skilled hands, and asa result we are forced more and more every day to compete 
with these foreigners. 
“Heretofore we have left this competition almost wholly to the ignorant men 
and women who learned their trades during slavery. I claim that a large propor- 
tion of the colored men and women who are educated in the colleges should take 
up industrial pursuits, should start brick yards, steam laundries, become con- 
tractors, become trained nurses, intelligent farmers, so that we will not be driven 
out of every industry on which our lifedepends. Mere book education not coupled 
with industrial training too often takes the young man from the farm and makes 
him yield to the temptation of trying to earn a living in a.city by the use of his 
wits. 
‘Notwithstanding the fact that nine-tenths of the colored people in the Gulf 
States earn their living by agriculture in some form, if we leave out what has been 
done by Hampton and Tuskegee we have done almost nothing in educating the 
people in the very industry in which they must earn their living. I claim that we 
should so educate the young colored man that he will not leave the farm, but will 
return to the farm after he has secured his education, and show his father and 
mother how, by the use of improved machinery, and by properly enriching the 
land, they can raise 50 bushels of corn on an acre of land where only 15 bushels 
were growing before. When a negro owns and cultivates the best farm and isthe 
largest taxpayer in his county, his white neighbors will not object very long to his 
voting, and having that vote honestly counted. < 
“Booker T. WASHINGTON. 
‘*EDWARD CUSHING MITCHELL. 
«President Edward Cushing Mitchell, A. M., D. D., of Leland University, enter- 
tains very pronounced views regarding the importance of a higher education for 
the colored race. In this connection he pointed out that no people had ever taken 
rank among the civilized nations of the earth without colleges which were the 
fountains of learning and of a higher civilization. .The colleges had always pre- 
ceded the common-school systems, which were really the outgrowth of the col- 
leges. This country had suddenly found within its borders a newnation, a people 
having a population of about 8,000,000 admitted to citizenship. The question was 
as to whether this vast population should be subjected to the same influences which 
had made a great nation of the American people or left to grope in the darkness 
of semisavagery. To say that the negro did not need the same educational advan- 
tages which had raised the white American to his present moral and intellectual 
status was to assume a moral and intellectual superiority for the African race. 
“Tn answer to a question as to the desirability of industrial education for the 
negro in lieu of the higher collegiate course, Dr. Mitchell referred the questioner 
to the following extract from one of his public utterances as an explicit expression 
of his views on the subject: 
‘* What shall we say now about the relation of industrial training to our prob- 
lem? Industrial training is good and useful to some persons, if they can afford 
time to take it. But in its application to the negro, several facts should be clearly 
understood. 
“1. It appears not to be generally known in the North that in the South all 
trades and occapations are open to the negro, and always have been. Before the 
war slaves were taught mechanic arts, because they thereby became more profit- 
able to their masters. And now every village has its negro mechanics, who are 
patronized both by white and colored employers. and any who wish to learn trades 
can do so,

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 2091 
“2. It isa mistake to suppose that industrial education can be wisely applied to 
the beginnings of school life. Said the Rev. A. D. Mayo, than whom no man in 
America is better acquainted with the condition and wants of the South: ‘ There are 
two specious, un-American:notions now masquerading under the taking phrase, 
“Tndustrial Education.” First, that it is possible or desirable to train large bodies 
of youth to superior industrial skill without a basis of sound, elementary educa- 
tion. You can not polish a brickbat, and you can not make a good workman of a 
plantation negro or a white ignoramus until you first wake up his mind and give 
him the mental discipline and knowledge that comes from a good school. * * * 
Second, that it is possible or desirable to train masses of American children on the 
European idea that the child will follow the calling of his father. Class educa- 
tion has no place in the order of society, and the American people will never accept 
itin any form. The industrial training needed in the South must be obtained by 
the establishment of special schools: of improved housekeeping for girls, with 
mechanical training for such boys as desireit. * * * And this training should 
begiven impartially to both:races, without regard to the thousand and. one theo- 
ries of what the colored man can. not: do.’—Address for National Educational 
Association, August.9, 1873. 
“3. Industrial training is expensive of time and money as compared with its 
results as a civilizer. When you have-trained one student, you have simply fitted 
one man to earn an ordinary living. When you have given a college education to 
aman with brains; you have sent forth an instrumentality that will affect hundreds 
of thousands. 
‘Said Chauncey M. Depew, in his address at the tenth convocation of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago, in April, 1895: ‘I acknowledge the position and usefulness of 
the business college, the manual-training school, the technological institute, the 
scientific school, and the schools of mines, medicine, law,.and theology. They are 
of infinite importance to: the youth who ‘has not the money, the time, or the oppor- 
tunity to secure a liberal education. They are of equal benefit: to the college 
graduate who has had a liberal education-in training: him for his selected pursuit. 
But the theorist, or rather the practical men who are the architects of their own 
fortunes, and who are proclaiming on every occasion. that: a. liberal education is a 
waste of time fora business man, and that the boy who starts early and is trained 
only for his‘one pursuit is destined for'alarger success, are doing infinite harm to 
the ambitious youth of this country. The college, inits four years: of discipline, 
training, teaching, and development, makes the boy the man. His Latin and his 
Greek, his rhetoric and his logic, his seience:and_ his philosophy, his mathematics 
and his history have little or nothing to do with law or medicine or theology, and 
still less to do: with manufacturing, or mining, or’ storekeeping, or stocks, or 
grain, or provisions. But they have-given to the youth; when he has graduated, 
the command of that superb intelligence with which God has endowed him, by 
which, for the purpose of a living or a fortune, he grasps his profession or his busi- 
ness and speedily overtakes the boy: who, abandoning college opportunities, gave 
his narrow life to the narrowing pursuit of the one thing by which he expected to 
earn a living. The college-bred man has an equal opportunity for bread and but- 
ter, but beyond that he becomes a citizen of commanding influence and a leader 
in,every community where he settles.’ 
“4, Industrial training is liable to divert attention from the real aim and end of 
education, which is a developed manhood. The young scholar can not serve two 
masters. It requires all the energy there is in a boy to nerve him to the high 
resolve that:in spite of all difficulties he will patiently discipline himself until he 
becomes aman. This is one reason why our Northern colleges, which in. many 
cases began as manual-labor schools, have abandoned this appendage to their cur- 
viculum. Ought we to insist on ‘putting a yoke upon the necks’ of our brethren. 
in black ‘which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear?’ 
“Finally.. Experience seems to show that industrial education does not educate, 
even in trades. In the report of the Bureau of Education for 1889-90 is a full 
statistical table of the lines of business in which the graduates of seventeen colored 
schools are employed. In all these schools industrial instruction is given, such as 
carpentry, tinning, painting, whip making, plastering, shoemaking, tailoring, 
blacksmithing, farming, gardening, etc. Out of 1,243 graduates of these schools 
there are found to be only 12 farmers, 2 mechanics, and 1 carpenter. The names 
of the universities are: ‘Allen,’ South Carolina; ‘Atlanta,’ Georgia; ‘Berea,’ Ken- 
tucky; ‘Central Tennessee,’ Tennessee; ‘Claflin,’ South Carolina; ‘ Fiske,* Ten- 
nessee; ‘Knoxville,’ Tennessee; ‘Livingstone,’ North Carolina; ‘New Orleans,’ 
Louisiana; ‘Paul Quinn,’ Texas; ‘Philander Smith,’ Arkansas; ‘ Roger Williams,’ 
Tennessee; ‘Rust,’ Mississippi: ‘Southern,’ Louisiana; ‘Straight,’ Louisiana; 
‘Tuskegee,’ Alabama; ‘ Wilberforce,’ Ohio.

“LL. G, ADKINSON. 
“President L. G. Adkinson, A. M., D. D., of the New Orleans University, said 
that, while he believed in the value of an industrial education for the youth of 
any race, white or black, he would not bein favor of in any way curtailing the 
present curriculum in use in the colleges for the colored race. As far as his own 
experience taught him, there was apparently little danger of any plethora of col- 
ored graduates in thenearfuture. In the first place, a majority of colored students 
had so little means available for the securing of an education that very few of 
them were ina position to take an extended college course, and, in the second 
place, they were, in most instances, so anxious to go out in life and earn a liveli- 
hood that they were inclined to leave college as soon as they had become qualified 
to teach in the public schools for their own race, and, as the demand for teachers 
generally exceeded the supply, they had no difficulty in obtaining satisfactory 
employment. ‘ 
“*As to the effect of a higher education upon the young people of the colored 
race, he had always found it beneficial, from a moral as well as from an intellec- 
tual point of view. The training received by the young men and women not only 
gave them a clearer and broader view of their responsibilities in life, but it endowed 
them with greater steadiness of purpose and business sense. 
“Among the more advanced students this improvement in moral and intellectual 
character had always been more marked than among the students who had left 
the college from the lower grades, but, as far as he had been able to trace them, 
he had not learned of a single student, male or female, who had gone out to leada 
life of vice or idleness after having spent two years or more in the Southern Uni- 
versity. In fact, he had not known of a single instance in which one of his stu- 
dents or ex-students had been arrested for lawbreaking of any kind. He believed 
that higher education was as beneficial to the one race as the other, but he thought 
that, as far as practicable, an industrial education should go hand in hand with a 
literary or scientific training. 
“In proof of his belief that a higher education was good for the young people of 
the colored race, President Adkinson pointed out the records of the lives of the 
past graduates of the New Orleans University, many of whom are now occupying 
honorable positions in the literary and educational world, while all were reputably 
and creditably employed. 
“He was also of the opinion that a college training was beneficial to colored 
boys and girls who contemplated going into domestic service. Many of the 
students who were then attending the college were devoting their spare time to 
domestic service in families who lived near the college, and their employers had 
always expressed themselves as more than satisfied with their services. 
** PRESIDENT HENRY A. HILL. 
“President Henry A. Hill, of the Southern University, expressed the opinion 
that there was no conflict between industrial and the higher collegiate education. 
He was of opinion that the two should go hand in hand to build up anything like 
a desirable manhood. If one or the other had to be neglected, he would consider it 
desirable to cling to the education of the mind rather than of the hands. Just as 
the mind was the more important part of man, so it was of importance that it 
should not be neglected. A collegiate education never failed to make a man 
brighter, to give him broader and more comprehensive views, and to make in all 
respects a better man of him. It was trite in these days to talk of the importance 
of education for the masses, as everybody admitted it to be of the last importance. 
It was not the negroes who had the advantages of a collegiate training who went 
to the bad, but in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred the negroes who could 
neither read nor write. A skillful mechanic who was lacking in intelligence was 
not likely to be a good nor successful member of society. As far as the Southern 
University was concerned, its students were mostly young men and women with- 
out means, and as soon as they had gone far enough in their studies to enable 
them to earn a comfortable livelihood they generally left the college to take such 
situations as might be open to them. In fact, since the establishment of the 
Southern University not one had as yet taken the full collegiate course. Some had 
become fairly advanced, and they were now doing well. They were not all

engaged in professional pursuits. Among those whom he could most readily call 
to mind, several were engaged in mechanical pursuits, such as plastering, brick- 
laying, carpentering, and they were all doing well, most of them being now 
employers of labor and engaged in prosperous business. These men were good 
mechanics and intelligent business men, much more so than they would have been 
had they not had the advantage of a few sessions at college. 
“Of the female pupils who had attended the college for two or three years, 
most of them were teachers, while the others were in most instances married. 
Some were milliners or dressmakers, but all had proven by their lives after leav- 
ing college that they had been materially benefited by the training they had 
received. The demand for colored school-teachers was so active that it seemed as 
if the colleges situated in New Orleans could not turn them out fast enough to 
meet the wants of the State in this direction. This was true of the boys as well 
as the girls trained in the local universities. Among the boys and girls who had 
found it impossible to remain long enough at the college to fit themselves for 
teaching, many had taken situations as domestic servants, and they had been 
found to be very desirable for this purpose. They were much more intelligent 
and better behaved than those who had no education. They knew their. places 
better, and were much more apt to hold a situation than those who had not 
attended college. They were in all respects brighter and more trustworthy. 
“In the Southern University all received an industrial as well as a collegiate 
training. This he considered of great importance. Boys who had spent several 
years in a college without having their muscles as well as their minds developed 
found it a great hardship to engage in manual labor after leaving college. Their 
muscles had become lax through protracted disuse, and to them, for a time at 
least, severe manual labor meant severe ‘pain that was almost unendurable. 
Whether a boy was white or colored, he did not believe in educating one portion 
of his system without the other. He did not believe that the industrial training 
at all interfered with the collegiate training proper, for the training of the muscles 
could go on at the saine time as the training of the mind in such a way that the 
one would in no way retard the other. Anyone who had had long experience in 
educating young children had not failed to notice how utterly impossible it was 
for many of them to keep still. They would squirm and twist restlessiy in their 
seats. This was not perversity nor natural unruliness, but simply the demand of 
nature for the exercise of their muscles. Tosuch children a very moderate amount 
of industrial training was a positive luxury, a rest and relaxation, and he had 
always found that they took kindly to it. If their industrial training continued 
to be neglected, they would in time become less impatient of restraint. This did 
not mean that they were becoming more obedient and tractable, but only that 
their muscles had begun to be vitiated in quality through disuse, a condition that 
was in all respects highly undesirable. 
‘‘Upon the whole, President Hill was unqualifiedly opposed to the curtailing of 
the curriculum for colored students, whom he considered quite as likely to be 
benefited by a higher education as white students could be. 
“R, L, DESDUNES. 
“R. L. Desdunes said: ‘While the right of acquiring education of any sort or 
degree is not to be denied, yet that subject, like others, may properly divide the 
opinions of mankind. I regard as education the use we make of-our sense to 
accomplish the ends of our existence. This definition leads me to consider avail- 
ing education as the best to be desired. I mean that training of our faculties best 
calculated to promote our own happiness and the happiness of others. Parents 
should consult surroundings, and from the inexorable logic of those surroundings 
pluck the rule of their conduct in what concerns the welfare of their children. 
“«« The colored man of to-day may or may not be the colored anan of to-morrow, 
and for that reason he should live for the all-absorbing present. If he teaches his 
child how to work in skilled labor, he places in the possession of that child the key 
to self-support, self-reliance, and dutifulness. As all philosophy may be resumed 
into what man owes to his God, to his family, to himself, to his neighbor, and 
humanity, it is therefore wise in him to pursue such a course in life as will more 
easily and more successfully help him to come up to the requirements of his mani- 
fest destiny. The past has proven that an elementary education, coupled with the 
manual training I advocate by preference, has secured for some colored people in 
the United States.most satisfactory results. Before the war it was the custom 
among the free colored families to send their children to school up to the age of 
14, in some cases 15. After that time they were apprenticed up to 20 and 21 
years. This rule applied to girls and boys. That sort of education furnished to

this city some of its best mechanics and seamstresses, and developed a population 
which, in point of intelligence, respectability, and industrious habits, could com- 
pare without disadvantage with any other of the same size and opportunities. It 
was a@ working population, yet it produced its poets, musicians, painters, etc. The 
book known. as *‘ Les Cenelles” is the fruit of their leisure. Lanusse and Questy 
were carpenters, Dede was a cigar maker, Populus a bricklayer, and Hewlett could 
turn his hand at almost any trade. 
> « «The colored man of to-day should not seek after higher education, not because 
he deserves it less than his more fortunate fellow-man, but because it is not 
profitable once in a thousand times. The average colored classic with his high 
Latin and Greek in this country is a literary Tantalus, only allowed to see, but 
without power toconquer. Let us have the skilled workman and the neellewoman; 
they will do more good for the present than this multitude of collegiates who for 
the want of opportunity lapse into servility or rascality.’ 
‘““BISHOP W. B, DERRICK. 
“Bishop W. B. Derrick, of New York, said that so far as the present generation 
of the colored race is concerned he favored educating the youth in the industrial 
and mechanical branches, without so much attention being paid to their scientific 
and professional education. 
“*T think it will be better,’ he said, ‘for these girls and boys to have a thorough 
education in the common-school branches, with special training in mechanics and 
agriculture, than to pursue the higher or classical education. 
“Tt is for this reason that’ I am opposed to the'so-called higher education of the 
present generation of the colored youth; that the race has not yet amassed suffi- 
cient wealth to enable these higher educated youths to take their place in their 
professions where, of necessity, they must be supported until they obtain a start. 
In other words, the boys’ parents are not rich enough to both educate them and 
support them while they make a start in the professions. And the time has not 
yet come when the negro can successfully pose as an ornament to society with 
advantage to his race. No; I think that the negro will advance more surely and 
rapidly by educating them gradually. Teach this generation how to work and 
manufacture or conduct business enterprises. When they have amassed the wealth, 
then let their children be educated for whatever anybody else is educated—the pro- 
fessions and all branches of knowledge and culture.’ E 
“OSCAR ATWOOD, 
“President Oscar Atwood, A. M., of Straight University, while deprecating any 
reduction or curtailment of the college curriculum, entertained very pronounced 
views as to the great value of an industrial training, which, in his opinion, ought 
always to be constantly associated with the education of the young people of both 
sexes. The institution over which he presided took the youngest pupils into the 
kindergarten department and undertook to train them up to final graduation, 
although there was only a small proportion of the pupils whom they advised to 
undertake the full course. They usually had about 600 pupils of all grades in the 
institution, and the average number graduated annually from the highest grade 
did not exceed 15. It was their practice to enconrage none but the brightest stu- 
dents to take the full course, although those who contemplated entering the Chris- 
tian ministry were encouraged toreach as high attainments as their circumstances 
would permit. He conducted the interviewer over the premises, taking particu- 
lar pains to point out the completeness of the industrial department, which is 
thoroughly equipped and well appointed for the purpose it is intended to serve. 
The boys show adihirable proficiency in cabinetmaking and joiner work, printing, 
and other occupations, while the mechanical drawings were excellent. The female 
students are all taught plain sewing, dressmaking, needle and fancy work, and 
the product of these industrial classes was found in all instances to be extremely 
ereditable. 
‘As to the benefit to be given to the young people of the colored race through 
a careful college training, President Atwood entertained much the same views as 
those expressed by the other college presidents interviewed on the subject, although 
he laid rather more stress upon the value and importance of an industrial training 
than any of the others. .

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 2095 
‘*BISHOP J, C. EMBRY. 
“Bishop J. C. Embry said the tendency of the day was unquestionably toward 
mechanical and industrial education in both colored and white educational insti- 
tutions. The changed and changing conditions of this country made the enlarge- 
ment of this system of education absolutely necessary if the greatest good and 
best results were to be obtained for the youth of the country. On the one hand 
the apprentice system that once obtained had practically passed away, while on 
the other hand the skilled mechanics and artisans of Europe were pouring into 
this country wee afteryear and driving out such American labor as was not fitted 
to meetit. Theeffectsof this immigration were being seriously felt, and the neces- 
sity of meeting it is fully realized in the East by both white and colored educators. 
The African-American colored colleges and institutions, Bishop Embry said, were 
reaching out and adding mechanical instruction whenever the opportunity offered. 
‘BISHOPS ARNETT. AND SALTER, 
‘Bishop B. W. Arnett, of Ohio, said that he thought it was for the best advan- 
tage of the negro race to get all the education he could, both common-school and 
in the higher branches.. ‘It is shown by the records,’ he said,.‘ that even when 
all the youth are offered the advantages of higher education, not more than one- 
fifth are able from one reason or another to avail. themselves of it. The propor- 
tion of one-fifth I do not regard as too high for the number of those in the profes- 
sions, and, therefore, I see no good reason for confining the education of the negro 
strictly to ‘the industrial and mechanical branches.’ 
“Bishop M. B. Salter, of South Carolina, said: ‘Let the negro get all the educa- 
tion he can, both with their hands-and in their heads.’ 
“BISHOP H. M. TURNER. 
“Bishop: H. M. Turner said that during the present’ generation, at least, the 
greatest efforts of the educators should be directed to the industrial and mechan- 
ical training of negro children. In this field there was'a much wider range for 
work and. development, and it was much easier to succeed under the conditions 
that prevail and were likely to continue in a large degree for years to come than 
in the arts and professions. Bishop Turner said hehad many scholars educated 
in the higher branches for whom he could find no employment. 
‘* BISHOP B. F. LEE. 
“Bishop B. F. Lee said he fayored following the same educational system that 
had made the white man strong and great and independent; without properly 
training the hand, all intellectual development is useless. ‘Simply elevating the 
intellect,’ said the Bishop, ‘only makes man vicious. The educational system 
should be blended. Some should be trained as thinkers, while others should be 
educated in mechanical and industrial callings.’ 
“COL, JAMES LEWIS. 
“Col, James Lewis:said while colleges were essential for the higher attainments 
of the race, the inclination for usefulness of a child could best be ascertained at 
home and in the schoolroom. Those children showing aptness for the professions 
or mathematics or mechanics should then be trained according to the bent of their 
mind. Colonel Lewis said the race was sadly in need of more normal, mechanical, 
and industrial schools, 
“*BISHOP A, GRANT, 
“Bishop A. Grant said: ‘In the first place, I think that the negro should not be 
educated asa race, but as anybody else. Why make any distinction? Secondly, 
whatever has served to educate and cultivate other races I think should also be 
taught to the negro. In other words, I think the negroshould be educated just 
ike anybody else, without regard to his color or race.’”’

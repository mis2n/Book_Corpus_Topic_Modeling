EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
LancvuacE is preéminently the educated man’s 
medium of expression. The perception of ab- 
stract laws and principles and the possession of 
those fine shades of feeling, which are his valua- 
tions of the finer distinctions he makes in experi- 
ence, require words to fix them in the mind and 
to communicate them to others. 
The educated man differs from the merely ex- 
perienced person through his ability to acquire 
truth and wisdom vicariously. He transcends 
the limitations of the particular time and place 
in which he spends his active life by his ability 
to experience indirectly through sympathy and 
imagination, what has occurred to others. Thus 
it is through “talk” and reading that he acquires 
that extension of intelligence which makes him 
different from other men. 
The command of the mother tongue has al- 
ways been regarded as essential to culture, and 
rightly so, for culture cannot proceed without it. 
Language is the chief instrument for acquiring 
and transmitting what men know. In our 
Vv

    EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
schools, which busy themselves with direct ex- 
periences only to get a basis or foundation for the 
appreciation of indirect or vicarious experiences, 
training in language must always be a continuing 
necessity. 
The school which does not graduate young 
men and women with a habit and liking for read- 
ing, conversing, and writing has somehow made 
a conspicuous failure. Schoolmasters are begin- 
ning to perceive with new force the relation of 
language to personal cultivation, and there is 
much current activity designed to give a better 
training both in silent and oral reading and in 
oral and written expression. 
The volume here presented recognizes all the 
important relations which have been suggested as 
basic in the consideration of the place of language 
in life and education, while concerning itself 
chiefly with the practical methods and devices by 
which children shall be taught to converse and 
write at a particular stage in their development. 
It is very specific in the aid which it gives. It 
communicates the principles of sound teaching 
by a sort of case method of presentation in which 
a group of essential considerations is embodied in 
a pedagogical procedure.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
English has advanced beyond certain traditional 
practices of the older English teaching of our 
profession. The subjects of discourse are not the 
assignments of a mind far removed in interest 
and knowledge from the minds of the Junior 
High School age. They are such as boys and 
girls of these years would spontaneously select 
for their own informal chatter. The students 
will have something to say, for they have knowl- 
edge at hand which bears on the theme suggested, 
and can readily acquire more. And what is 
more important, they will want to tell and write 
what they know. There is vitality in the whole 
method of teaching composition here suggested; 
or, to use a current and very popular professional 
phrase, the work laid out is highly “motivated.” 
We have at last reached “rock-bottom” in 
teaching when our methods start with the funda- 
mental need to give children an imperious desire 
to express themselves in language. When the 
urge or the ambition to talk or write is provided, 
needed knowledge will be forthcoming, for the 
pursuit of knowledge will then be adventurous 
and ardent. Even the technical formalities of 
English composition will cease to be dreary mat- 
ters. It will be seen by youth itself that what it 
wishes to do cannot be done without a command

of tools and technical skills. It will wish to pos- 
sess them as much in the writing of a news story 
for the school paper or the writing of a nonsense 
verse for an afternoon’s entertainment, as the 
equipment and technical skill of a tennis game or 
a running race are desired on the playfield.

TEACHING ENGLISH IN 
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS 
PREFACE 
“Haven’t I seen you somewhere before?” The 
. voice was that of a young girl across the table. 
“T know. It was at the High School of Com- 
merce. Do you remember me? I was substi- 
tuting.” 
I looked more closely at the bright, eager face. 
Yes, I did remember her. She was the girl whom 
two of the regular staff had taken to be a new 
student. 
“T have a position now,” continued the voice. 
“Tam teaching in L Don’t you teach Eng- 
lish? I thought so. Did you ever have any 
ninth-year pupils? Yes, isn’t that fine! This is 
my first year. How many compositions do you 
think ‘they’ ought to have in ninth-year Eng- 
lish?” 
“Tsn’t there a course of study to guide you?” I 
asked.   
I
-P-A-G-E-10
PREFACE 
“Yes, but it just tells us what books to use, and 
which chapters to study. I haven’t any idea 
how many themes to assign, and as for teaching 
‘them’ how to write —” An expressive gesture 
told the hopeless story. 
“But doesn’t the head of your department tell 
you what to do?”’ I asked. 
“T asked her, and what do you suppose she 
said? —‘Use your own judgment!’ — Just as if 
Id have any in my first year of teaching!” 
So we both laughed, after which I did my best 
to tell her all the “tricks of the trade” that I 
could think of. 
This monograph is an attempt to combine in a 
unified and useful form some of the devices which 
the writer has learned from experience, from the 
practices of successful teachers, and from read- 
ing. It does not attempt to tell what to teach, 
for courses of study necessarily vary. Itis hoped 
that the plans related here will be helpful to 
many teachers who understand their own needs, 
but do not know just where to find help to meet 
those needs.

SOME PRELIMINARY REMARKS 
“Tr I could make them over, I’d make them 
different,” declared the Youngest Assistant 
vehemently. 
“What is it this time?” The older woman 
glanced understandingly at the bundle of themes 
stacked in a neat pile on the desk. 
“Everything!” The tone was one of absolute 
discouragement. ‘They can’t reason. They 
can’t remember. They don’t want to learn to 
reason or to remember. If I could make new 
brains for these children, I’d certainly make 
them different from the brains Nature gave 
them!” 
The Youngest Assistant has yet to learn to 
take “them” as she finds them, and since she 
cannot make “‘them” over to suit her methods, 
to make over her methods to fit “them” and 
their needs. 
When she has discovered that the mind of the 
adolescent must be coaxed and lured into action, 
half the battle is won. When she learns how to 
tease that mind, cajole it, woo it, tempt it into 
3
-P-A-G-E-12
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
action, then she is on the highway to success. 
Such success comes to the teacher only when she 
has learned how to get fun out of her work, and - 
when she has discovered that there is genuine 
fun, of a most satisfactory sort, in this coaxing 
and cajoling, enticing and decoying the pupil 
with the most attractive devices she can find. 
Particularly is this true of the teacher who is 
dealing with adolescence, the difficult age, with 
its whims, its unreasonableness, its ardors and 
its strong dislikes, its self-consciousness, its ego- 
tism, its inconsistencies, its social instincts, its 
individual differences, and the separate personal 
problems presented by awakening individualities. 
The problem is greatest with the child of 
Junior High School age. For teachers of other 
subjects the problem is relatively simple, for the 
aim is definite, but the plight of the English 
teacher, who has to struggle with three distinct 
problems at the same time, is more serious. Her 
task is much more complicated. 
Junior High School English hasthree func- 
tions, which are, in the order of their importance: 
/first, to cultivate in the pupil an appreciation of 
( the best things in literature, art, music, and kin- 
dred subjects; second, to increase his power to- 
express himself, both in speech and in writing; 
4
-P-A-G-E-13
SOME PRELIMINARY REMARKS 
third, to impress on his mind a knowledge of 
certain essential, fundamental facts regarding the 
mother tongue.) Any device for vitalizing the 
work of the English class in the Junior High 
School must therefore serve one or more of these 
specific aims. 
An adolescent appreciates the activity in 
which he is engaged, or the subject that com- 
mands his attention, when he likes it well enough 
to ‘come back for more.” 
. For this reason, some devices should be delib- 
erately used to make the English class a pleasant 
place where fun is to be had. Such devices 
should be used with discretion. They should not 
be overdone, or take up too large a proportion of 
the class time. Yet time spent in making the 
English hour joyous is not wasted if pupils come, 
through such activities, to look forward to the 
recitation and to take part in it willingly. 
Other wiles entice the pupil to seek more of the 
kind of literature presented to him at school. 
Competitive work and team work call to his 
attention worthy methods of employing his lei- 
sure time. Then there are tricks to develop the 
power of expression, necessary drills disguised in 
the pretty clothing of games and plays. 
In cultivating accuracy in spelling, punctua-

tion, and the use of correct forms of speech, 
essentials of grammar, or knowledge of necessary 
facts about the books read, variety is possible 
only when devices are used. The more variety a 
teacher can secure, the greater will be the net 
result in material actually mastered by pupils.

DEVICES TO CULTIVATE 
APPRECIATION 
Group Projects 
ProFeEssor James F. Hosic has defined a project 
as “‘a single complete unit of purposeful experi- 
ence.” Other interpretations of this compara- 
tively new method have been given, some of 
which are broad and hazy enough to cover any 
activity at all out of the ordinary. The writer 
prefers to limit the term to such activities of real 
life as are transferred to the schoolroom to vital- 
ize and give reality to its work.! 
The project is the result of an effort to seek less 
artificial methods of learning, based on natural 
principles. It invariably involves group activity 
and fosters and stimulates individual effort 
within and for the sake of the group. The class 
hour becomes a work hour, not a recitation 
period. The classroom becomes a laboratory for 
the solving of problems and the solution of indi- 
vidual | difficulties, while the group_as a whole

mentary School Journal (June, 1921), pp. 778-81.

  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
moves forward toward the accomplishment of a 
definite aim. 
How does one proceed to develop a project? 
Just what takes place? What is gained by the 
use of the method? Such questions can best be 
answered by making a detailed study of some 
successful project already worked out. 
One of the most successful of the projects with 
which the writer is familiar is the publication of a 
live school newspaper. This project is particu- 
larly well adapted to a school which has its own 
printing plant. The full hour period, and the 
longer school day of the most progressive new 
schools, are always decided advantages in an 
undertaking of this type. 
The High School of Commerce, Worcester, 
Massachusetts, has two courses in Journalism, 
each a half-year in length. Journalism I pupils 
receive preliminary training for a half-year, while 
Journalism II classes write, edit, set up, and 
distribute every other week an eight-page news- 
paper known as the Mercury. This paper is 
practically self-supporting. In a school of over 
two thousand pupils the Mercury has a paid cir- 
culation of eight hundred at one dollar per year. 
Under the general supervision of a student adver- 
tising manager and an assistant, local advertising 
8
-P-A-G-E-17
      APPRECIATION 
is solicited to an amount nearly sufficient to float 
each issue. Advertising is paid for at the rate of 
ninety cents an inch by the single issue, or fifty- 
five cents per inch for each issue when space is 
taken for the half-year. At the end of the year 
the school board subsidizes the project to the 
extent of paying the deficit, which is always 
small. 
At the beginning of the term all Journalism 
classes spend their time for two or three days in 
a grand drive for advertising. Pupils leave the 
school building during the class hour and call on 
business men at their offices, grocers in their 
stores, merchants in their shops. They thus get 
a first-hand contact with the business life of the 
city. Many members of the class become enthu- 
siastic to the extent of giving up free time to hunt 
“ads” for the Mercury. 
Meanwhile tickets for the ten issues of the 
coming half-year are sold in the schoolrooms. 
These tickets are punched every time the owner 
receives a copy of the paper. 
As soon as the circulation and advertising 
drives are over, real work begins. With copies of 
the latest issue as a text, the little journalists are 
initiated into the mysteries of heads, leads, 
banks, keylines, streamer heads, type sizes, cuts, 
9   
-P-A-G-E-18
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
credit lines, scoops, and other terms peculiar to 
newspaper parlance. Then the pupils bring in 
Worcester, Boston, New York papers, and by 
means of these explain and illustrate technical 
terms they have learned. Different types of 
papers are compared. Some are seen to be con- 
servative, others sensational. Questions of pol- 
icy are discussed. The Mercury policy is discov- 
ered to be the promotion of harmony among the 
four high schools of the city. 
Then problems are dictated, newspaper stories 
with the facts jumbled, irrelevant matter intro- 
duced. The task of the student is to write a good 
lead to his story, then tell the pertinent facts in 
a straightforward manner. The “copy” is re- 
turned to him again and again, until it has been 
whipped into proper form. No mark is given to 
any story until it has been put into printable 
form and typed. The earlier problems have to 
be written over many times, but before he has 
done his full stint of twenty “problems,” the 
average student is able to write a good, clear 
news story at the first attempt. 
The following problem, with a student’s first 
attempt just as he passed it in, and his accepted 
“copy,” illustrate the practice work done in 
Journalism I:

A News Writing Problem 
Make a connected news story of the following 
facts: A party held at Naval Radio station, Barracks 
B, Otter Cliffs, Maine. Moving picture being taken 
of party. Forty navy men present. Twelve women 
and children of their families. Booth blocks exit. 
Film explodes. Barracks burn. People jump from 
windows. Snow breaks fall. Noone hurt in jump- 
ing. Operator killed. Assistant injured. Opera- 
tor, Clinton W. Ward; assistant, J. R. Dalton. Fire 
loss $150,000. Ward’s body searched for to-day, but 
not yet found. Fire did not spread because wind 
blew flames away from neighboring barracks. 
The Pupil’s First Story 
The body of Clinton W. Ward, of Fitchburg, Massa- 
chusetts, has not yet been found, after the explosion 
of the motion picture machine in Barracks B, at the 
Naval Radio station at Otter Cliffs. 
A picture which is being taken at Otter Cliffs re- 
quired forty men of the navy and twelve women and 
children to represent their families. It is being taken 
in the recreation hall of Barracks B. 
The picture projecting booth is at the head of the 
only stairway. The picture was being taken of an 
entertainment when the film exploded. 
Clinton Ward, operator of the machine, was killed 
outright. His assistant, J. R. Dalton, who came from 
Tennessee, was badly burned about the face, but he 
II
-P-A-G-E-20
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
will soon recover. No one else was injured because 
the people jumped from windows of the hall. The 
snowdrifts being very deep broke their fall. 
The fire spread very rapidly, but the wind was not 
in its favor. The Barracks were razed to the ground 
and are estimated at $150,000. 
The Pupil’s Accepted Story (fourth attempt) 
The body of Clinton W. Ward, of Fitchburg, Massa- 
chusetts, who was killed yesterday in the explosion 
of a motion picture film at the Naval Radio station at 
Otter Cliffs, Maine, has not yet been recovered, al- 
though the ruins of Barracks B, which were burned 
as the result of the fire, were carefully searched this 
morning. 
J. R. Dalton, of Marburg, Tennessee, who was as- 
sisting Ward at the moving picture machine, and who 
was badly burned about the face, is resting comfort- 
ably, and it is thought that his injuries will not prove 
serious. 
The explosion occurred last evening when a picture 
was being taken of an entertainment held in the rec- 
reation hall in Barracks B. Forty men of the navy 
were present, with twelve women and children of of- 
ficers’ families. Exit by thestairway was impossible, 
for the picture booth had been placed on the upper 
landing. The guests were forced to jump from the 
windows into the snowdrifts below. Fortunately no 
one was injured, for the snow broke the force of the 
drop from the windows. 
12

APPRECIATION 
Although the fire spread rapidly through the 
building, none of the other barracks was endangered, 
for the wind blew the sparks in the opposite direc- 
tion. The loss is estimated at $150,000. 
From the example given, it is obvious that 
practice in writing newspaper stories cultivates a 
sense of form, accuracy, and an appreciation of 
the value of a good clear style. Problem work in 
Journalism is effective drill in English composi- 
tion from a novel angle. 
Do the pupils like it? Indeed they do! One 
group promoted from Journalism I to Journal- 
ism II in January, 1923, expressed a unanimous 
opinion that the number of problems should 
be increased from twenty to twenty-five. Pu- 
pils like problems because problems are definite. 
Their willingness to rewrite a story till it is ac- 
ceptable is phenomenal. They are willing to 
work overtime. There is always the sound of 
busy typewriters in the Journalism office after 
hours. Journalism pupils do “come back for 
more.” 
The Mercury comes out every other Friday. 
On the preceding Monday all Journalism pupils, 
including those in Journalism I, are given an 
opportunity to turn in any “copy” they wish, 
jokes (original, and connected with the school), 
13  
-P-A-G-E-22
  
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
news items, skits, write-ups of parties, debates, 
athletic events, etc. Special items that require 
following up from week to week are assigned to 
capable members of the Journalism II classes. 
Newspaper English and Literary English 
After the problem work is completed, the 
Journalism I classes spend some time reading 
Chaucer, King Lear, and a volume of short 
stories. They are encouraged to make constant 
comparisons between ‘‘newspaper English” and 
“literary English.” They learn to appreciate 
the best by such comparisons, and to discriminate 
between journalistic writing that is well done, 
and that which bears too obviously the marks of 
ignorance or haste. 
The course of study for Journalism IT includes 
brief lessons in advertising, head-writing, and 
the technique of the short story. Each pupil 
attempts to write at least one short story. The 
literature includes a short survey of the History 
of English literature, Milton’s L’ Allegro, Il Pen- 
seroso, Comus, Lycidas, and Tennyson’s Idylls of 
the King. If the course were arranged for Junior 
High School pupils, the literature chosen would, 
necessarily, be less advanced.

APPRECIATION 
Preparing for an Issue 
Journalism II produces the greater part of the 
Mercury. Staff officers have definite functions, 
and take great pride in their responsibilities. On 
the Monday before the Mercury is issued, the 
Journalism room is alive with industry. “Re- 
porters” bustle importantly in and out of the 
room, or flit about the building gathering facts 
for their “copy.” Typewriters click busily. 
There is a hum of earnest conversation as the 
staff members consult one another. The editor- 
in-chief is in earnest conference with the faculty 
managing editor as to cuts and as to the news 
stories which are to occupy the positions of 
prominence on the front page. Only “live” 
news must go on the front page. Good heads 
must be written for the copy. Some one must 
carry the bundle of completed copy to the press. 
Some one else must consult the engravers about 
the “cuts” for the new issue. On Tuesday, odds 
and ends are finished up and carried to the 
printer. On Wednesday morning the last strag- 
gling bits of late copy are hurried off by some 
willing pupil messenger. 
On Wednesday evening the editor-in-chief 
meets with his two assistants at the home of one 
I5
-P-A-G-E-24
  
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
of the members of the staff, the galley proof is 
sent up from the press, and the editors puzzle 
over the intricacies of setting up the “dummy.” 
Thursday morning the “dummy” is presented 
for faculty approval, after which it is carried back 
to the press. Final proof-reading is done at the 
printing establishment Thursday afternoon. 
Friday morning the Mercury is sent to the 
school, ready for distribution as soon as the sec- 
tions have been folded. At recess time the cir- 
culation managers and their assistants punch 
tickets and distribute papers, and the lunchroom 
is neglected while eager readers scan the new 
Mercury ‘to see whether there are any scoops.” 
And there usually are! 
During the six years since the project was 
started, the Journalism course has grown steadily 
in popularity. At the present time two faculty 
editors are needed to handle the large classes. 
The project is elective, yet.it continues to 
attract an increasing number of students in spite 
of the demands it makes upon their time. What 
better proof could there be of appreciation? 
Other Important Group Projects 
Journalism represents but one of an infinite 
variety of activities of real life which lend them- 
16
-P-A-G-E-25
  APPRECIATION 
selves to group activity in the classroom. The 
pages of recent educational magazines are full 
of plans which have been tried by successful 
teachers. Many of these group plans have as 
their aim the correlation, by means of the project 
method, of English and Social Science. 
Flora Snyder ! suggests a method of procedure 
adapted for use in the organization of any proj- 
ect. Her article is valuable reference material 
for any one intending to try the project method 
for the first time. It emphasizes strongly, to the 
mind of the present writer, the most essential 
characteristic of project work: that the teacher 
must have a PLAN, and that she must have a 
pretty definite idea how to ORGANIZE her class to 
work out the plan. 
Edith Rodkey * gives several good plans for 
unified group activity: ‘““A Study of Home In- 
dustries,”’ ‘‘Notable Movements of Our Own 
Time,” “Living Men and Women who are Doing 
Things Worth While.” All these plans link up 
school interests with vital interests of the real 
world outside.

  APPRECIATION 
SOCIALIZED ORGANIZATION 
What is the socialized recitation? How does it 
help the young people to a better appreciation 
of the good things presented to them under the 
general guise of English? 
Socialized organization throws the conduct of 
the recitation largely into the hands of the stu- 
dents themselves, with the teacher present as 
mentor and guide over difficult places. The plan 
has many advantages for both pupil and teacher. 
It tends to develop in the pupil a freedom in the 
use of language, a lack of self-consciousness, a 
spirit of codperation, an ability to take a position | ~ 
of leadership gracefully, good manners, initiative. 
It keeps him alert and appreciative. He comes 
to look upon the teacher as a friendly helper 
rather than as a taskmaster. The socialized 
recitation prevents the teacher’s talking too 
much. She has an opportunity to observe how 
her charges react to one another under natural 
conditions. She sees her pupils and their needs 
individually rather than en masse, and can help 
them more intelligently. She feels less nerve 
strain, and is seldom irritable. 
Does the pupil appreciate his English work 
better under such conditions? He likes the new 
19
-P-A-G-E-28
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
organization! There is always something inter- 
esting to do. He can start things himself. He 
is encouraged to have ideas about things, so he 
takes an interest in the things themselves. He 
“comes back for more” willingly, which is the 
acid test for appreciation. 
The easiest way to introduce to pupils the 
idea of socialization is to try the pupil-teacher 
method. 
The Pupil-Teacher Method 
It is a curious but indisputable fact that chil- 
dren who feel no qualms about saying, “I don’t 
know,” when the teacher asks a question, feel 
ashamed to make the same reply when the ques- 
tioner is one of their own number. For this 
reason, as well as for the reason that the plan 
offers no especial difficulties of management, the 
best form of the socialized recitation to experi- 
ment with is the simple pupil-conducted reci- 
tation. 
A literature lesson will provide suitable mate- 
rial. Prepare your own questions, remembering 
that usually “how” and ‘‘why” questions will 
produce the most fruitful results. These ques- 
tions should be given out the day before your

placed on the blackboard. Tell the children to 
prepare answers to the questions. Tell them 
that one of their own number will be permitted 
to act as teacher, and to question the class. 
Explain that the pupil-teacher will need to be 
sure that his answers are correct if he is to bea 
success. 
On the next day, call for a volunteer pupil- 
teacher. You will be surprised at the response. 
Nor will all of the volunteers be the brighter 
members of the class. The first time, however, it 
will be wise to select some one upon whom you 
can depend. Later on, give some of the slower 
pupils an opportunity. Some of them will sur- 
prise you, for many an apparently dull child 
needs only an opportunity to try his powers of 
leadership in order to discover that he has more 
self-reliance than either you or he dreamed. 
Even the first two or three lessons of this kind 
will produce a marked improvement in the qual- 
ity of the preparation. Every one wishes to be 
pupil-teacher. The discovery is soon made by 
the class that, in order to succeed in this réle, the 
lesson must be well prepared. 
The next step is to have some child prepare the 
questions for the next day, assign them, and 
after the lesson has been prepared, conduct the

recitation in so far as questioning the class is 
concerned. When this plan is being used, the 
teacher must be alert and prepared to reject 
trivial questions in the assignment, and to supply 
omitted questions on important points. The 
power to question skillfully grows rapidly with 
practice. 
The following questions, on Treasure Island, 
Part I, illustrate the type of question which can 
be used in such pupil-conducted recitations: 
How did Jim happen to write the story of Treas- 
ure Island? 
Where did he live? 
How did the old seaman look? 
How did he get into the Admiral Benbow Inn? 
Why did he stay? 
What did the man with the barrow have to say 
about him? 
How did the old seaman spend his time? 
Why did he ask about seafaring men? 
Why did he give Jim money? 
Why did Jim have bad dreams? 
How did the captain frighten people? 
How did he hasten the death of Jim’s father? 
How much pains did the captain take with his 
dress? 
How did Doctor Livesey silence the captain? 
Why were Jim and his mother kept so busy? 
How was Black Dog received?

Why did the captain tell Jim to go to the doctor? 
What was the black spot? 
Why did Jim have no time to think about the cap-

How did the captain act after Black Dog’s visit? 
How did the blind man give the black spot to the 
captain? 
Why did the captain fall? 
Why did Jim and his mother leave the house? 
Why did they return alone?

What did the squire know about Flint?

What did the squire promise to do? 
Why did the doctor distrust the squire? 
The Class as a Club 
Another device is the organization of the class 
as a club with chairman and secretary. These 
offices are held in rotation so that every one has a 
chance to preside, and to act as recording secre- 
tary. The secretarial reports are kept in a book 
and form a complete record of the work accom- 
plished during the term. 
At the opening of the period the chairman for 
the day takes his place before the class. 
“The class will please come to order,” he an- 
nounces. And the class comes to order immedi- 
ately; far more quickly than for the real teacher! 
“The secretary will please read her report,” 
continues the chairman. 
The secretary steps to the front of the room, 
and solemnly reads her report. 
“Ts there any criticism of the report?” asks the 
chairman. 
Several hands are raised. 
“Gladys Hudson.” 
“The secretary failed to mention the spelling 
24

  APPRECIATION 
drill which we had at the close of the hour yester- 
day,” says Gladys. 
“The secretary will please make the correction 
in her report. Is there any other criticism?” 
Apparently there is no further criticism. 
‘All those in favor of accepting the report will 
please raise their hands. The report is accepted. 
Grace Nelson has the oral theme to-day.” 
Grace trips primly before the class, and gives 
a mildly humorous talk on “Having a Dress 
Fitted.” 
“Are there any criticisms?” asks the chairman. 
Hands are raised. 
“Joseph Scanlon.” 
“She said, ‘The dressmaker gave her orders 
quick.’ She should have said ‘quickly.’” “Why?” 
“¢Quickly’ is an adverb, It modifies ‘gave,’ 
so an adverb is needed.” 
“Anything else? Did she make any other 
mistakes, Leon McLeod?” 
“Grace said, ‘This time it was worst than the 
first time.’ She was comparing two things. 
She should have said, ‘This time it was worse 
than it was the first time.’” 
“Ts there any other criticism?” 
No response, 
25
-P-A-G-E-34
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
“T noticed another mistake,” says the chair- 
man. “She said, ‘I moved as slow as a snail.’ 
She should have used the adverb ‘slowly’ to 
modify the verb ‘moved.’ What mark shall we 
give her? How many say C?” 
Only two raise their hands. 
“How many say BP” 
Most of the members of the class agree to this 
mark. 
“Any A’s?” 
There are three pupils who have the poor 
judgment to feel that the recitation should be 
marked A. 
Off in an inconspicuous corner, the teacher, 
who has thus far said not a single word, makes 
note of the B, the mark given Grace by the judg- 
ment of a majority of her peers. 
“Now we'll discuss the lesson,” continues the 
presiding officer. “Marjory Durrell may ask the 
questions.” 
After the questions have been disposed of, 
comes the announcement: “Miss Blank [the 
teacher] will now take charge of the class.”” The 
chairman now sits with the class. The teacher 
takes the opportunity to straighten out any 
tangles in which the class has involved itself, to 
conduct any drills which she thinks necessary, 
26
-P-A-G-E-35
APPRECIATION 
and to assign, with the codperation of her class, 
the work for the next recitation. 
The class is appreciative, quiet, orderly. 
There is little friction. English is not a bugbear, 
but an anticipated pleasure. 
How about the lazy pupil? While the recita- 
tion is proceeding, the teacher makes note of any 
pupils who do not volunteer for criticisms, or 
for answers to questions. Such pupils she calls 
upon later to recapitulate the main points of the 
lesson, so that they soon come to realize that the 
slacker cannot “‘slack”’ successfully in a social- 
ized recitation. 
Programs of Entertainment 
Arranging bi-weekly programs to entertain 
their classmates is a form of group activity that 
always delights young people. Such programs 
are planned by committees who are at liberty 
to call upon members outside their own group 
for assistance in the prospective entertainment. 
The committee may also call upon the teacher 
for advice or assistance. Programs made up of 
readings, solos (if there is any musical talent in 
the class), and Victrola selections are popular. 
Sometimes Victrola selections alone are used. 
For example, a class which had been studying 
27
-P-A-G-E-36
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
The Lady of the Lake had a “Lady of the Lake” 
concert during which six of the twelve songs in 
that poem were heard. These songs may be had 
in the Victor records as follows: 
No. 17987 “Soldier Rest,” soprano and contralto 
duet, Olive Kline and Elsie Baker, harp 
accompaniment. 
“Coronach,” music by Schubert, trio with 
woodwind accompaniment. 
No. 55052 ‘Hail to the Chief,” male quartet with 
bag-pipes. 
“Ave Maria,” music by Schubert, sung 
by Lucy Marsh, soprano with harp ac- 
companiment. 
No. 18674 “The Toils are Pitch’d,” Laura Little- 
field, soprano with orchestra. 
“They Bid Me Sleep,” Laura Littlefield 
with orchestra. 
Books were kept open, and the printed lines 
were followed as the songs were sung. 
The week after this program was given, an 
untidy little girl announced, “They have good 
music at the O—— Theater. The orchestra 
played ‘Hail to the Chief’ last night. I knew it 
because I had heard it on the Victrola last Friday.” 
At least one member of that class was learn- 
ing something of musical appreciation as a by- 
product of the English course. 
28

  APPRECIATION 
Other entertainment plans which have been 
used with success are: 
A Shakespeare Program. 
A Dickens Program. 
An Uncle Remus Program. 
A Scotch Program (a little Scotch girl danced a 
Highland Fling in costume). 
A program of negro spiritual music. 
Dramatizations. 
Debates. 
In debating for fun these pupils enjoy an occa- 
sional nonsense debate. They grow comically 
oratorical in the effort to be convincing on such 
topics as: ‘‘Resolved, that all teachers be com- 
pelled to wear rubber heels”; “Resolved, that all 
boys be given an extra holiday each week”; ‘‘Re- 
solved, that all girls be required to take a course 
in manual training”; etc. Both debaters and 
audience get much fun from such grandiose 
nonsense. 
Sometimes the teacher consents to read a 
story, but not too often, since the programs lose 
their point when they are not class activities 
in the true sense of the word. Miss Mary A. 
Laselle’s excellent selection of stories, Joy in 
Work, contains delightful material for such 
reading.

The writer will never forget one program based 
on the “Classic Myths” and illustrated by 
tableaux. Two of the living pictures stand out 
vividly — Niobe and her kneeling daughter, both 
clad in middy blouses; and two short girls and a 
tall girl, a penholder, and a long piece of string 
that formed a recognizable living picture of ““The 
Three Fates” in a ninth-year class. The chances 
are that the young people who were in that 
particular class have not forgotten the ‘Three 
Fates” either. 
Flora Snyder! presents several programs 
worked out by ninth-grade committees. One 
such committee wrote a play for its Thanksgiving 
celebration. Another arranged a program of 
“Toasts given at a class dinner in 1950.” Still 
another planned an Indian program, with Indian 
legends, customs, poems, etc. 
Many other plans suggest themselves to the 
imagination, such as art programs, with pictures 
to illustrate the talks; a Millet program, a 
Michelangelo program, a Fra Angelico program, 
a Bonheur program. The Dickens and Shake- 
speare entertainments immediately suggest others 
of a literary nature, based on the work of

Class”; in English Journal (1920), pp. 345-47.

Longfellow, Whittier, Scott, and many others. 
There is no limit to the purposeful work that 
may be accomplished in this way. 
Using Illustrative Materials 
How shall we find place for the illustrative 
material we should like so well to use? Why not 
sacrifice a part of the blackboard space? Cover 
it with burlap — the natural unbleached color 
makes the best background, and can be had for 
nineteen cents per yard — and post pictures to 
illustrate the literature you are studying, or the 
project you are working out. Let the children 
do most of the hunting for pictures. The modern 
magazines are full of beautiful prints that depict 
surprisingly well actions and descriptions found 
in the literature. Children scour their neighbor- 
hoods and ransack their own attics and those of 
their friends for new pictures for their bulletin 
boards. 
It is best to have such prints mounted on draw- 
ing paper of uniform size, and pinned to the 
burlap. Change the pictures frequently, or let a 
committee take charge of the matter. Discuss 
the pictures, compare their qualities, watch the 
improvement in the taste of your class. 
But too many pictures are brought. Not all 
31
-P-A-G-E-40
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
can be exhibited. Very well, let the young peo- 
ple make scrapbooks of their own to preserve 
the illustrations they have worked so hard to 
find. 
If the teacher wishes to spend a little of her 
own money for exhibition material to supple- 
ment that of the pupils, she can get blue-prints,* 
four inches by five inches, to illustrate nearly all 
the classics studied in school. For example, 
there are seventy-five fine prints for Scott’s 
Ivanhoe alone. If these are used, it is a good plan 
not to exhibit them until after the exhibition of 
the pupil’s own material. 
Exhibiting Compositions 
The burlap-covered bulletin boards are useful 
also for the posting of copies of standard com- 
position scales, preferably copied in longhand, 
so that they will look as much as possible like 
pupils’ own themes. Side by side with these 
should be displayed some of the best of the class 
work, 
Current Events 
Current Events day once a week teaches young

APPRECIATION 
people to read the papers intelligently, to appre- 
ciate the difference between sensationalism and 
news stories that are vital. Again, it teaches 
them to look for what is significant, to appreciate 
the higher type of news, and the better class of 
newspaper. 
Current Events day may be conducted as a 
socialized recitation, the chairman calling upon 
his classmates for their topics. Clippings and 
pictures describing and illustrating the items may 
be displayed on the bulletin board. Sometimes 
events will be reported which are not worth dis- 
cussing, but the class soon learns to censor such 
items. Therefore the exercise cultivates dis- 
crimination and appreciation of what is worth 
while. 
Writing between the Lines 
Children usually declare that they do not like 
poetry. Hunting for pictures to illustrate de- 
scriptive lines tends to make them appreciate the 
beauty of rhyme and rhythm. They also “see 
more in poetry” if they are trained to “read be- 
tween the lines.” This is an exercise which is 
always enjoyed. The idea is introduced first by 
a discussion of the meaning of “reading between 
the lines” of personal letters. Very soon some 
33
-P-A-G-E-42
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
bright student can be led to volunteer the in- 
formation that “‘a person has to be able to read 
between the lines to understand what most 
poetry means.” 
The teacher appears to hesitate about accept- 
ing this statement. Rather dubiously she sug- 
gests, “I don’t know whether you are right or 
not. Shall we try reading between some lines of 
verse, to see whether your idea is true or not? 
Will some one suggest some lines to try?” 
Some one suggests four lines from a song in The 
Lady of the Lake. . 
“Tl dictate them,” volunteers the teacher. 
“How shall you write them?” 
“Spread the lines apart,” says a pupil, “so 
that we can write between them.” 
“And you need not put your names on the 
papers. I want you to write between the lines 
just what occurs to you. I shall not know whose 
paper I am reading, so you need not try to write 
what you think I want.” 
Here are some of the results: 
Row, VASSALS, ROW, FOR THE PRIDE OF THE HIcH- 
LANDS! 
I see Scotchmen in a rowboat, all rowing hard but 
one who shouts orders.

This exercise divides a class into two sharply 
differentiated groups — those who invariably 
interpolate pictures, visual images, and those 
who always read an idea between the lines. In 
both cases pupils learn to “let themselves go” 
when they read poetry, and to enjoy that form of 
literature in proportion as they bring something 
35
-P-A-G-E-44
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
of their own to its interpretation. They discover 
to their surprise that they have poetry in them- 
selves. 
Original Nonsense Verse 
There is poetry in many of the most common- 
place names. At least, there is rhythm. Try 
scanning some of the names of pupils: 
Elizsb&th Wildér 
Marjérie Manning 
_ Bérn&rd Sc4nlén 
After they have scanned their own names in 
this way, pupils are eager to experiment with 
other words, then with lines of verse, then with 
whole stanzas. Then it is an easy step to the 
composition of original verses. Limericks are 
easy, then parodies, then little ‘Grammar 
Rhymes.” Some will soon try more ambitious 
verses, and, behold, the English class finds itself 
writing verses almost without effort! 
After a class has written original “verse” for a 
few days, while enthusiasm is still high, it is time 
to make comparison between what the children 
have written and real poetry. Now is the op- 
portunity to offer subtle suggestions as to good 
poetry and trash, for our real object in presenting

pupils can do when enthusiasm runs high:

His teacher promptly said to him, 
“You may come for an afternoon session!”

DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
Ora THEMES 
TuE purpose of oral theme work is to give pupils 
the power to stand easily before an audience of 
their peers, and without embarrassment to pre- 
sent, in good, clear, acceptable English, an idea, 
an experience, or information worthy of the at- 
tention of such an audience. 
H. Caldwell Cook! tells how such work is 
handled in the Perse School, Cambridge, Eng- 
land. He says: 
Briefly, the scheme is but this: the boys come out 
one at a time and speak to the class for a few min- 
utes on subjects of their own choosing. The lectures 
may be either prepared or extempore. One member 
of the class acts as chairman and announces the 
speaker, another goes about to discover who is ready 
to speak next, and upon what subject, and a third 
official at the close of each lecture ascertains the 
marks. The marks are apportioned by the boys of 
the class, voting with a show of hands. 
Some of the subjects treated by these English

erick A. Stokes Company.

boys in what Mr. Cook calls the “Littleman 
Lectures” are: 
Flying a Kite. 
On the Use of a Handkerchief. 
How to do your Hair. 
Learning to Swim. 
Saturn and his Rings. 
Motor-Busses. 
The Rule of the Road. 
The Mechanism of a Zeppelin. 
Japan. 
The Royal Marines. 
Contraband. 
Turbines. 
Explosives. 
Military Tactics. 
The Battle of Copenhagen. 
The Pig. 
Cambridge. 
In short, the boys were allowed to speak on 
every sort of conceivable subject — provided 
only that the subject was of interest to the 
speaker. Says Mr. Cook: 
The lecture “On the Use of a Handkerchief” was 
interesting because at first sight it appears that there 
is nothing seemly tosay. But the speaker dealt with 
his subject in the manner of a Book of Courtesy, giv- 
ing directions of what to do, and warnings against 
42
-P-A-G-E-51
  DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
things to be avoided. He made a point of the unob- 
trusive nature of the operation, counseled his hearers 
not to indulge in any preliminary wavings, and gave 
a graphic description of what happens in the urgency 
of a sneeze, when the handkerchief has to be snatched 
hurriedly out of a pocketful of accumulated boy- 
stuff. He raised merry laughter by his catalogue of 
the miscellanea which most of his hearers had at that 
moment in their pockets — string, pencils, papers, 
stamps, knife, whistle, and Littleman alone knows 
what. Another point which delighted the listeners 
was the serious warning against “that loud trumpet- 
ing sound,” though the lecturer, with conspicuous re- 
straint, it seemed to me, refrained from any illustra- 
tion. 
The choice of “How to do your Hair” as a subject 
also surprised me, for to all outward seeming Little- 
man does not as a rule “do” his hair at all. But the 
speaker was a boarder, and had doubtless observed 
the scrupulous care with which some of the senior 
boys in the House attended to their toilet. I well re- 
member a clique of youths, when I was about sixteen, 
who spent nearly an hour on Sunday, between break- 
fast and morning Chapel, in “doing” their hair! 
There was much talk of “partings,” much care to 
have them clean and straight. And it was essential 
for smartness to part your hair in the middle rather 
than at the side.... 
“Saturn and his Rings” was a very good lecture. 
As an ordinary ignorant schoolmaster I could not on

that morning have said two words about Saturn and 
his Rings, so I listened attentively to this boy of 
eleven while he told us what he had seen for himself 
through his astronomical telescope, and what he had 
read in books. 
In common with most other people I have at- 
tended popular lectures on many scientific subjects, 
and I can say that a good Littleman lecturer, speak- 
ing very plainly, and without tiresome repetitions 
and unnecessary explanations, will give an attentive 
listener more information in ten minutes than the 
usual adult lecturer will in half an hour. Littleman 
is not discursive, he says a thing once and leaves it. 
...Littleman is not conscious of any need to talk 
down to his hearers. .. . One thing which makes for 
a good straightforward style, full of matter, is the 
need to be brief. . 
There are two kinds of oral themes. The more 
common type has been twice illustrated already, 
in the example given of a socialized recitation, 
and in the quotation from The Play Way. This 
type of theme is the isolated individual talk, in 
which, as in the old-fashioned written theme, the 
pupil chooses a subject on which he talks from 
three to five minutes. There are two ways of 
organizing such a plan for oral English. At 
regular intervals, as, for example, on every other 
Friday, the class may give its full time to deliver- 
44 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  
DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
ing, hearing, discussing, and marking the oral 
themes. If the group is composed of individuals 
who are very active and alert, this scheme works 
out well, but with an ordinary class, where the 
ability of a majority of the members is but medi- 
ocre, there is danger of too much monotony. 
To avoid making the necessary oral work irk- 
some through sheer boredom, many teachers 
have hit upon the plan of hearing but one theme 
each day, the pupils being required to give the 
talks in rotation. 
A list of 1079 theme topics, most of which are 
admirably adapted for oral use, is given by 
Charles Swain Thomas.! It is a good plan to post 
a list of seventy-five or a hundred of these topics 
on the bulletin board where pupils may have easy 
access to them for use in the preparation of their 
talks. The following topics for oral work have

Mildred Buchanan Flagg presents a series of 
“Undertakings” as the basis of profitable oral 
reports. The “Undertaking” has a definiteness 
that a mere subject for a theme cannot have. 
Some of Miss Flagg’s “Undertakings” are: 
To investigate one of the public utilities in your 
community and to give a short report of your inves- 
tigation. 
To make an investigation of the government of 
your community and to give a short report of your 
investigation. 
To investigate and report on one of the industries 
in your community. 
To give a brief report of an interview with some 
successful person in your community. 
To make a report on a job in shop work or in man- 
ual training. 
To investigate and make a report on the develop- 
ment in methods of printing. 
49
-P-A-G-E-58
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
To make a report of material collected for a bk 
ographical sketch.! 
The suggestion is made under the topic of pub- 
lic utilities that different pupils investigate and 
report on such separate utilities as the water- 
works, the gas plant, the telephone, transporta- 
tion, electricity, parks, playgrounds, public libra- 
ries, hospitals, schools, markets, 
The pupil is directed to look for certain things 
in his investigation. For example, under the 
topic of electricity, he is asked whether his city 
owns its own electric light plant, and if it does 
not, who does furnish the lights for the streets 
and houses. He is told to find out what is done 
about the matter when trees interfere with the 
stringing of the wires. 
Such searching questions as these are asked: 
Are the streets sufficiently lighted to afford pro- . 
tection on a dark night? 
Do you use electricity for any other purpose than 
light in your house? 
Which is the cleaner and safer to use, electricity or 
gas? 
What power drives the dynamo in the electric 
1 Mildred Buchanan Flagg: Community English. By per- 
mission of The Macmillan Company, publishers.

light plant? Is it a gas engine, gasoline engine, 
steam engine, or is water power used? 
Does the appearance of your electric light plant 
and electric light office add to the beauty of your 
city? If not, can you suggest some way to make the 
place more attractive? 
The second and more profitable type of class- 
room talk grows inevitably out of a group proj- 
ect, and is the natural means for imparting the 
information which the separate groups have 
secured. It is readily seen that Miss Flagg’s 
“Undertaking,” which involves reports on public 
utilities, may easily be knit into a “Public Utility 
Project.” Work on a project creates a normal 
audience situation, for since the groups have 
worked separately on different phases of the 
same unit of activity, they have a genuine curi- 
osity to know what the other groups have dis- 
covered regarding matters closely related to 
their own investigations. 
It is obvious that oral themes which grow 
naturally out of a group project destroy the 
artificial atmosphere and self-consciousness of- 
ten present when the oral themes are discon- 
nected, isolated, and bear no relation to one an- 
other. 
A project which led naturally to a class presen-

tation of unified subject-matter is described by 
Grace H. Ryffel. 
The project was called “Junior Arts and 
Crafts Exposition.’ The groups were divided, 
and topics investigated as the following outline 
indicates. 
I. Home group. 
How to use color in the home.

How to construct a model aeroplane. 
The part played by the aeroplane in the

and future possibilities of it. 
Miss Ryffel’s article illustrates the fact that 
the idea of linking up social science with the 
English work is a growing tendency in the more 
progressive schools. Miss Flagg’s book, Com- 
munity English, likewise emphasizes this practical 
modern tendency. 
Whether the individual talk is adopted as the 
OS 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
means of securing self-expression in oral English, 
or the more progressive plan of the group project, 
the purpose is fundamentally the same. The 
oral theme develops in pupils at the right time 
the power to stand easily before an audience of 
their peers, and to present, without embarrass- 
ment, in clear, coherent speech, material interest- 
ing to that audience. 
SILENT READING 
Nearly all adult reading is done in silence, for 
one of two purposes: for relaxation or enjoyment, 
and for information. Silent reading for the 
purpose of relaxation or enjoyment has been 
almost entirely neglected in schools until very 
recently, and while there has of necessity been 
much reading for information in connection with 
other subjects of the curriculum, there has been 
no special instruction as to the best way to do 
such reading, and the process has too often been 
a haphazard and joyless one. The power to read 
profitably can be cultivated by intelligent prac- 
tice, just as the power to speak effectively can be 
fostered by judicious exercise. It matters not 
whether one is reading for fun or for fact, one 
needs to know how best to go about it. 
Even as recently as 1920, an article in the 
54
-P-A-G-E-63
  DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
English Journal appeared in defense of reading 
for enjoyment in school. Miss Evalina Harring- 
ton ! shows that it is still necessary to defend the 
presence in the curriculum of a story whose only 
excuse for existence is the craving of the mind of 
youth for the keen excitement of imaginary adven- 
ture skillfully depicted. Says Miss Harrington: 
Read a story in school for enjoyment? Read it 
because it is a “great adventure of the mind”? Why 
is it in the course then? One may read for enjoy- 
ment out of school. 
“Why, indeed?” says the teacher. ‘Why serve it 
on the table? Why not leave it on the lower Pane 
shelf and let them find it?” 
Let the day-dreams of this youthful discoverer in 
the hospital speak for it:

The Sister when she turned the pillow over

(SARAH CLEGHORN) 
Miss Harrington applies her remarks to Treas- 
ure Island. Do they not express admirably the 
spirit that prompts the inclusion of many stories 
to be found in the modern course of study? 
Dickens, Scott, even much of Shakespeare, 
should be read in school for the sheer delight that 
comes from yielding one’s mind to the witchery 
created by such imaginative writers. 
A teacher was holding a conference with four 
ninth-year boys who were not doing good work. 
She was trying to reach the underlying cause of 
their poor work, so she encouraged the boys to 
talk pretty freely. All of them confessed that 
they did not like to read at all. Aside from the 
books required in school, they never read at all. 
There was no home influence exerting a quiet 
pressure, no tradition of reading established in 
56
-P-A-G-E-65
  DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
the family, nothing outside the school to lead 
them to taste the pleasures to be found in the 
reading of good books. 
Such conferences as this show all too plainly 
that it is a part of the task of English teachers, 
especially during the years of adolescence, to 
open up to such children as these the possibilities 
for enjoyment in the cultivation of the reading 
habit. The public librarians are willing allies, 
but the work must start in the school. 
As the conference drew to a close, the English 
teacher said: “You boys don’t know what you 
are missing. There are ever so many good 
stories in print that are more exciting than the 
movies, and just as much fun. Didn’t you like 
Treasure Island?” 
The boys admitted that Treasure Island was 
interesting. One volunteered the information 
that the movie made from the story was not 
nearly so good as the original. 
“Tl tell you what I’ll do,” said the teacher. 
“T have a boys’ book at home that I’ll lend you. 
It isa story about smugglers. If you'll read that, 
I think you will be willing to try another after- 
wards.” 
Three of the boys responded readily to the 
suggestion. The fourth was older, a hardened 
57

“repeater.” Perhaps if he had been “caught 
younger,” he too might have responded. 
Much can be done, both directly and indi- 
rectly, to arouse interest in outside reading. 
Directly, the oral composition period may occa- 
sionally be given over to brief accounts of favorite 
books, of favorite heroes, of well-loved heroines, 
of thrilling events recorded in magazine or story. 
Indirectly, there are countless devices to arouse 
curiosity about books. 
Sentences or paragraphs for dictation may be 
introduced by such a casual remark as: “This 
paragraph is taken from The Last of the Mohi- 
cans, an interesting Indian story by James Feni- 
more Cooper.” 
The writer once stimulated interest in a volume 
of Louisiana Plantation Stories, by Andrew Wil- 
kinson, by basing upon that book a series of 
sentence analysis drills called for by the course of 
study. The drills were prefaced by the remark 
that the sentences were taken from that partic- 
ular book, and that pupils who wished to take 
the book home to read might borrow the teacher’s 
copy. Needless to say, that copy of Louisiana 
Plantation Stories was kept very busy during the 
ensuing six months. 
What not to do has been humorously told by 
58
-P-A-G-E-67
  
DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
Professor F. N. Scott in an address in which an 
imaginary experiment in the teaching of litera- 
ture to a class just beyond the Junior High 
School age is graphically depicted. In the sup- 
posed experiment the teacher was to be left free 
to choose the books to be read by the pupils. 
Says Professor Scott: 
If I were not engaged in this inferior business of 
teaching in a university, . . . I should like to... take 
charge of a class [that is, tenth year] in English. I 
think I should talk to the pupils in some such way as 
this: 
“The classes of former years have been reading 
this prescribed set of books — a pretty poor sort of 
literature, in my opinion, and not proper for young 
people to read. You are very fortunate in being able 
to get rid of them. They are mostly very dull and 
uninteresting. There is the Iviad, for example, full 
of fighting and blood and the killing of men, and of 
armies clashing with one another in desperate con- 
flicts where all the elemental and violent human pas- 
sions are set free. Horrible! The International 
Peace Society cannot approve of anything of that 
sort. We will put this book aside, and I hope none 
of you will touch it. Then there is the Faérie Queene, 
all about giants and maidens in distress, magic and 
mystery of all sorts — perfectly useless, a futile, 
silly thing, nearly as bad as the Arabian Nights. 
Don’t go near it. I trust, also, that no one will at- 
59
-P-A-G-E-68
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
tempt to read As You Like It, which has a wrestling 
match in the very beginning (these minor athletics 
ought not to be allowed in literature) and tells about 
a girl who ran off into the forest in boy’s dress —a 
most improper performance on her part. 
“Tam sure we ought not to talk about those things 
in this class. And even worse, perhaps, is Tenny- 
son’s Princess, where a prince, who ought to know 
better, disguises himself in woman’s clothing and 
gains admission to a girls’ academy. A scandalous 
thing! No gentleman would act in that way. In 
short, these books are all harmful and ought to be 
destroyed. For the present, I will put them on the 
top shelf of the closet here, and just as soon as the 
janitor is at liberty, we will have them burned. 
“And now we are going to take up some books 
which I know you will enjoy. I want you to be just 
as enthusiastic as you can about them, for we are go- 
ing to study them and study them hard, and you will 
get a great deal of profit out of them, and all will be 
greatly improved. For the boys we will take Cap- 
tain Mayne Reid’s Afloat in the Forest. We are go- 
ing to read that book a paragraph at a time and ex- 
amine carefully every allusion in it. It is about 
some people who floated down the river Amazon. 
First we will draw a map of South America, locating 
the course of the river, and then we will ascertain how 
wide the Amazon is at various points and how fast 
the current moves. Finally we will determine the 
amount of silt which is deposited by the river at its 
60
-P-A-G-E-69
  DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
mouth. Captain Mayne Reid, by the way, makes a 
mistake. He has three people float down in a much 
shorter time than they possibly could. You will see 
that this is so when we discover the exact relation- 
ship between the flow of the stream and their rate of 
progress. We shall go into these details with the ut- 
most care, and after a little while you will write some 
nice little essays about them. 
“For the benefit of the girls we will read in the 
same careful and scholarly way Robert Chambers’s 
Heart Throbs of a Multimillionaire. We will deter- 
mine just how many times the heart throbs when two 
hearts are in unison, and learn about the two kinds of 
blood corpuscles, and so on, and there will be essays 
on all these things also. 
“But this is not all. Two years from now... we 
will take these books up again and go over them 
and over them and over them until you know the 
answers to every last question in regard to all 
these mathematical, biological, chemical, and top- 
ographical things, and that will be absolutely de- 
lightful.” 
I think we can prophesy what would be the result 
of such an experiment. If the room were not locked 
or the closet door locked, after two or three weeks 
those classics which were put on the top shelf would 
have to be rebound, and as regards the other books, 
when their very names were mentioned, I think 
the pupils would fly shrieking. They would never 
again want to see the Heart Throbs of a Multimil- 
61
-P-A-G-E-70
    JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
lionaire, or even Afloat in the Forest, good as that 
book is.! 
But not all silent reading is for the purpose of 
diverting and exciting theimagination. Reading 
for enjoyment changes the attitude of dislike for 
books to one of pleasure and anticipation. Once 
the “reading habit” is established, the transition 
from the use of books merely for entertainment 
to their use in the quest for information is easy. 
Here the English teacher can codperate success- 
fully with the teacher of Community Civics, 
History, Physiology, General Science, Shop 
Work, Domestic Training. The greater the 
spirit of mutual helpfulness developed between 
the teacher of English and the teachers of other 
subjects, the greater will be the mutual profit, 
and the greater the gain for the child. 
Books should be easily accessible, and there 
should be freedom of selection. Conferences 
with the teacher in regard to the reading, and as 
to the places where desired information can be 
found, should be encouraged. Unless there is at 
the same time great freedom of selection, the 
pupil will not learn to discriminate for himself. 
Until the “‘reading habit” is firmly established, 
1 Proceedings of the North Central Association of Colleges and 
Secondary Schools (1912), pp. 67-72. 
62
-P-A-G-E-71
DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
much school time should be given over to silent 
reading, both for pleasure and for information. 
Some one has said that “the love of reading may 
be the beginning of wisdom.” This is surely true 
when reading for pleasure is carried over into the 
field of reading for information, which happens 
when the pupil develops a hobby demanding 
information of an exact nature. 
In connection with the silent reading of in- 
formational material, objectives worked out for 
seventh-grade reading by Professor R. L. Ly- 
man,! of the University of Chicago, are highly 
suggestive. He offers specific objectives to be 
kept in mind throughout the entire seventh year, 
together with devices relating particularly to the 
work of the fifth month. These suggested ob- 
jectives are so valuable to every Junior High 
School teacher that it will be well to quote them 
here in full. 
Silent Reading objectives for the seventh grade: 
x. First month: Speeding up silent reading. 
a) Tests to acquaint pupils with their rate 
of reading. 
b) Attacking new words boldly (individual 
differences in word analysis, etc.).

  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
c) Trying to see several words at one time 
(grouping and phrasing for perception of 
thought groups). 
d) Learning when to read rapidly, and when 
to read slowly. 
2. Second month: Purpose in reading (purposes 
and problems, old and new; goals). 
a) Does the reader bring a problem to his 
reading? 
b) Does the reading itself suggest a problem? 
c) Reading carefully for one’s problem. 
d) Finding a new problem growing out of one’s 
reading. 
3. Third month: Grasping the central thought in 
reading (unity and forward movement of 
thought). 
a) Is the master-idea in the title? 
b) Finding the clue sentence and the sign- 
posts. 
c) Is the master-idea repeated in each para- 
graph? 
d) Contribution of each paragraph to the 
master-idea. 
4. Fourth month: Getting a bird’s-eye view of the 
reading (comprehending the reach; recalling 
main heads). 
a) Noting the plan of the writer. 
b) Selecting the outstanding ideas. 
c) Details building up the main thought. 
d) Stopping to recall the main points. 
64 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
5. Fifth month: Helping the writer in reading (the 
reader’s active participation). 
a) Two minds active in reading. 
b) Reading between the lines. 
c) What is the writer’s message for the reader 
personally? 
d) His different message from other people? 
6. Sixth month: Tying up what we know with our 
reading (the meaning of assimilation). 
a) Recalling similar experiences of one’s own. 
b) Recalling different experiences. 
c) Asking questions of the writer. 
d) Tying up one lesson with another. 
7. Seventh month: Selection in our reading (per- 
sonal preferences).

b) Following the promptings of curiosity. 
c) Determining the worth of a selection. 
d) Passing by the unimportant. 
8. Eighth month: Judging values in our reading 
(weighing the worth of statements). 
a) Whose statements may one rely upon? 
b) Having our own opinions when we read. 
c) The difference between knowing and guess- 
ing. 
d) Being perfectly sure and fair and honest. 
g. Ninth month: Making use of our reading (active 
utilization of results). 
a) Being alert to solve problems. 
b) Storing ideas away for future use. 
65
-P-A-G-E-74
    
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
c) Putting information into action. 
d) Various ways of using our reading. 
A program... worked out for each of the thirty- 
six objectives of the outline... [says Professor Ly- 
man in conclusion] provides for the incoming English 
classes of the Junior High School at least one innovat- 
ing type of language drill. It is one means by which 
English teachers in the new intermediate school may 
vary the traditional work of the upper grades; one 
way by which they may enrich their own instruction, 
and at the same time better prepare their pupils for 
good study habits in all their reading courses. 
Edith Shepherd ' shows the practice followed 
in helping a seventh grade in the University of 
Chicago Junior High School to get the greatest 
possible benefit from reading material for Com- 
munity Life. Three types of reading matter 
were used: text, supplementary, and recreational. 
The topic studied was ‘‘The School.”’ The text- 
book topics used were: “How the American 
School Developed,” ‘Money Value of an Educa- 
tion,” ‘How to Get the Most out of an Educa- 
tion.” Supplementary material included: Com- 
munity Leaflet No. A 11, ‘Education as En- 
couraged by Industry”; Community Leaflet 
No. A 27, “Concentration of Social Institutions.”

High School English”; in School Review (1921), pp. 206-15.

The following purely recreational books were 
used in correlation with the topic under con- 
sideration: Tom Brown’s School Days, The 
Hoosier Schoolmaster, Nicholas Nickleby, The 
Hoosier Schoolboy, Myra Kelley’s Little Citizens, 
Piper’s The Boy on the Prairie, Williams’s The 
Adventures of a Freshman. 
An informal test was conducted for the purpose 
of determining the rate of reading. Individual 
scores varied from 141 to 405 words per minute. 
Each pupil’s rate could then be compared with 
the standard for grade seven, which is about 270 
words per minute. The rate test showed plainly 
which individuals in the class needed special drill 
in order to speed up their rates to standard. 
Four methods were used to increase speed: 
practice something a little hard; practice accord- 
ing to the “rules of the game’’; practice with 
mind alert; practice of a variety of reading exer- 
cises. The “rules of the reading game” are: 
first, discovering the “‘sign-post paragraph ”’; sec- 
ond, finding the conclusion or decision; ‘third, 
determining why the conclusion was reached. 
The results ascertained by the rate test made 
it possible to group pupils according to reading 
ability, and to differentiate practice exercises 
according to the ability of the different groups. 
67

  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
Four types of poor readers were found among 
those of low ability, each needing a different kind 
of exercise. There were lazy, hazy, purposeless 
readers; conscientious, plodding, word-by-word 
readers; timid, nervous, uncertain readers; and 
docile, undiscriminating memorizers. 
Each of these defects needed special treatment. 
At the same time the average, and the better- 
than-the-average pupil needed practice adapted 
to his powers. Accordingly, practice was differ- 
entiated for the three main groups: superior, 
mediocre, and poor readers. A series of lessons 
was given for special practice in selecting the 
central ideas or main points in reading. 
The topic was “The School.” The text 
treated the topic under six heads: “How We 
Learn,” ‘‘ How the American School Developed,” 
“How the Public Schools are Controlled and Sup- 
ported,” ‘‘What Education Should Be,” “The 
Money Value of an Education,” ‘‘ How to Get the 
Most out of School.” 
The first day’s work consisted of the presenta- 
tion of the principle of finding the central idea, 
with introductory practice in finding the main 
points under “How We Learn.”’ There was no 
differentiation for the three groups. 
The second day, the slow group reviewed the

work given the day before, together with its 
applications to “How We Learn.” ‘The average 
group read “How the American School Devel- 
oped,” while the superior group read both “How 
the American School Developed,” and ‘‘How the 
Public Schools are Controlled and Supported.” 
These two groups prepared to report the im- 
portant facts of these sections of the chapter to 
the slow group, which, of course, had not read 
them. The last two fifths of the period were de- 
voted to these reports, and to a discussion of the 
points which had been studied. 
On the third day the slow group began by read- 
ing the second section of the chapter, finding and 
marking main points. The average readers pre- 
pared questions on this same section to bring out 
important ideas. The superior group was given 
freedom to do general library reading as soon as it 
felt that it was prepared to answer the questions 
to begivenlater. The last of the period was used 
for a written “quiz” prepared by the average 
group, and for a discussion of the brief answers. 
On the fourth day the lesson began with a 
silent reading of “‘What Education Should Be” 
by all groups. The slow group alone was in- 
structed to mark the central ideas. This gave 
the teacher the opportunity to observe separately 
69
-P-A-G-E-78
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
individuals in the slow group, to point out to 
them mistakes, and to help them over knotty 
points. The superior group met as a committee 
as soon as its work was finished, and decided 
upon an outline for the section. This outline 
was put on the board to guide the class discussion 
as soon as the committee had prepared it. The 
average group was permitted to do extra reading 
as soon as the assignment was prepared. When 
each group had completed its work, the whole 
class took part in a discussion of “What Educa- 
tion Should Be.” . 
All groups read section 5, ‘“The Money Value 
of an Education,” silently on the fifth day, the 
slow group again marking main points, compar- 
ing them with the points made by the author in 
his summary at the end of the section. The 
other two groups, after reading the section, pre- 
pared for a discussion of questions at the end of 
the chapter, which took place during the latter 
part of the period. 
All three groups read ‘‘How to Get the Most 
out of School” on the sixth day. Only the slow 
group needed supervision. The average group 
prepared to summarize the last four pages for 
class presentation, while the superior pupils made 
plans for reading aloud some poem or incident : 70

chosen from supplementary reading because of 
its application to the topic under consideration. 
Devices used to give variety to the search for 
central ideas included: rapid reading with the 
marking of main points, then comparing results 
with those marked by other members of the 
same group; making an outline, indicating cen- 
tral ideas by Roman numerals; guessing from the 
title what the main point is to be, then checking 
up by actual reading; marking points, then com- 
paring with the author’s own summary. 
This consistent, definite drill in the principles 
A silent reading resulted in notable improvement 
in the reading power, particularly of weaker 
pupils, conquered much of their uncertainty and 
lack of confidence, and gave a new power and 
sureness of comprehension that must have de- 
lighted the departmental teachers to whom these 
pupils went for instruction in such subjects as 
history or science.

Junior and Senior High Schools, which was

The chief value of such lists as these is that 
they serve as nuclei to which constant additions 
should be made as both pupils and teacher dis- 
cover new titles worthy of places on the list. 
Life implies growth. A Junior High School read- 
ing list ought above all things to be alive, and to 
remain alive it must grow. 
Crass Discussions” 
Effective English teaching demands the use of 
two entirely different types of questions. The 
more common type, necessary for testing and 
drilling the pupils in their actual mastery of facts 
from day to day will be more fully discussed else- 
where. The other type, the thought question, 
which, well handled, leads to heated class discus- 
sions due to differences of opinion, and to ani- 
mated, self-forgetful expression of opinion, de- 
mands on the teacher’s part a far greater degree 
of skill. When a class becomes accustomed to 
discussions initiated in this way, a new power, 
a new alertness, develops with amazing speed. 
There comes a keenness of insight, a quickness of 
thought, an ability to see through shallow argu- 
ment and the thoughtless, parrot-like repetition 
of opinions that are not based on a foundation 
of solid fact. No school exercise does so much 
79
-P-A-G-E-88
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
to develop the power to think for one’s self as 
does the frequent, judicious use of the thought 
question. 
All worthy literature suggests questions of this 
type. Thought questions involve comparisons, 
decisions as to right and wrong actions, con- 
siderations of policy, problems of life. 
The method of handling such a discussion can 
be explained most clearly by a concrete example 
of what actually takes place when a group of 
pupils is engaged in considering some question 
of moment. 
A ninth-year class is reading Hawthorne’s 
Gentle Boy. There is the usual socialized pro- 
cedure. A pupil-teacher is putting questions 
which she herself has made. Let us watch the 
class as the pupils respond to the questioner. 
We observe that most of the questions she asks 
are questions of fact such as these: 
“Who rescued the gentle boy?” 
“Where did he find the boy?” 
“Why was the boy alone?” 
“What did Dorothy say when Tobias brought 
Tibrahim home with him?” 
The response is good. Most of the pupils are 
interested. There is a great waving of hands, an 
eagerness to display a knowledge of the facts. 
80
-P-A-G-E-89
DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
The pupil-teacher has been well trained, and does 
not always question those who waggle their 
hands with the greatest violence. Now she is ask- 
ing a question of an undernourished-looking little 
boy who has not volunteered so freely as his mates. 
“Why did the people object to Ibrahim’s 
playing with the other children?” 
The little fellow squirms, reddens, looks ex- 
tremely uncomfortable, and stammers, “I don’t 
know. I’ve forgotten.” 
So some one else answers the question. 
Again he is asked, “Why did Ilbrahim’s 
mother let him stay with Dorothy?” 
Again he squirms, and stammers, “He didn’t 
have no other place to go”; and some one else has 
to complete the recitation. 
So the recitation proceeds, knotty points in the 
reading are disposed of, the teacher has made a 
mental note to consult the principal about the 
apathetic little boy who has plainly been pro- 
moted beyond his grade, and has again resumed 
charge of activities. 
Very quietly, and in a manner which implies 
that she has not quite settled the matter in her 
own mind, she asks: 
“Do you think the Puritans did right when 
they kept their children away from Ilbrahim?” 
81
-P-A-G-E-90
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
Watch the class now. No hands wave wildly. 
Most of the pupils look rather blank. There is a 
little pause, the room is very still. A puzzled 
frown appears here and there. There are fewer 
blank looks than there were at first. The teacher 
is watching for signs of intelligence. 
“Well, what do vou think, James Morrill?” 
“T don’t think they did right,” says James. 
“Why don’t you think so?” 
James merely shrugs his shoulders. 
Frank Kearney, however, has his hand up. 
“Well, Frank, what do you think about 
itp 
“T think they did right,” says Frank with con- 
viction. ‘‘The Puritans had come all the way 
from England, and been in all sorts of hardships 
just for the sake of their own religion. They 
wanted their children to be Puritans. Maybe 
Ibrahim would have talked to their children 
when they were playing, and tried to make them 
like the Quaker religion.” 
This is better. It always takes a little time for 
the class to “warm up” to a discussion like this. 
The teacher is patient. 
“What do you think about it, Ruth John- 
son?” 
“T think the Puritans did not do right. They 
82
-P-A-G-E-91
  
DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
should have let their children play with Ibrahim. 
They came to America because they believed in 
freedom. ‘They were not giving their children 
freedom when they wouldn’t let them play with 
Ilbrahim. Besides, it wasn’t Ilbrahim’s fault 
that his father and mother weren’t Puritans like 
the rest of the people.” 
But Frank Kearney is already on his feet. 
He forgets all about the usual formality of 
waiting for the teacher’s permission before he 
speaks. ‘The teacher merely smiles a little to 
herself. Why interrupt a train of thought for 
the sake of a mere formality? 
“But Ilbrahim was a Quaker himself, and he 
made a Quaker of Tobias. I guess if he could 
influence an old man like Tobias Pierson, and 
make him turn Quaker when he had been a 
Puritan all his life, I guess he would have influ- 
enced the Puritan children too, and they would 
all have turned into Quakers pretty soon. Their 
parents would have been sorry then. I guess 
they had a right to protect their own children 
from getting any queer ideas from a. boy like 
Ibrahim.” 
By this time, every one has taken one side or 
the other, and all the teacher has to do is to act as 
moderator, and preserve a reasonable state of 
83
-P-A-G-E-92
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
order. She has accomplished her purpose, her 
pupils are using their brains, and formulating 
opinions for themselves on an important subject. 
Moreover, they are expressing that opinion both 
forcefully and clearly. What does it matter that 
the decision of a majority of the class is different 
from the decision that the teacher has formulated 
in her own mind? The pupils have a right to 
their opinion. They have thought it out for them- 
selves, and have found arguments in defense of it. 
When this question is disposed of, other prob- 
lems are considered: 
“Do you think Ilbrahim’s mother did right to 
leave her little boy with Dorothy?” 
“Do you think Tobias did right when he be- 
came a Quaker?” 
These and other questions are attacked with 
zest and vigor, and the dismissal bell comes all 
too soon. It is interesting to note that these 
questions involving rather delicate problems are 
discussed without any personal rancor in a class 
composed of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish 
children. 
WRITTEN COMPOSITION 
Written reports which grow naturally out of 
group projects yield far better results than any 
84
-P-A-G-E-93
  DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
other type of composition. In such a case the 
pupil actually has something to say. The writ- 
ten report is merely a medium by which he seeks 
to preserve an idea, an experience, or interesting 
information. The written record is the last 
stage in the unfolding of a successful project. 
Given something to say, written expression is 
not so difficult, even for the adolescent. As the 
man said when he was called upon for an ex- 
tempore after-dinner speech: a person does not 
dread speaking itself so much as having to speak 
when he has nothing to say. It is the latter 
which ‘‘wrenches a man so terribly!” Many a 
perspiring young writer has agonized over the 
struggle to put his ideas down in black and white, 
when the only difficulty was that he had no ideas 
whatsoever! Is it any wonder that he felt that 
the effort “wrenched him terribly,’ and that he 
either gave up in despair, or produced something 
quite maudlin and worthless? The project re- 
moves this fundamental difficulty absolutely. 
The Problem Method 
A new angle can be given to concentrated 
theme work by what, for want of a better name, 
may be called the “problem method.” This is in 
fact a laboratory adaptation of the daily theme 
85
-P-A-G-E-94
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
to younger pupils. It has the advantage of 
bringing about prolonged concentration upon the 
principles of expression, and a continuity of effort 
that is possible in no other way. 
On some auspicious Monday morning, near the 
middle of the term, the ninth-year English class 
listens with some perplexity to an announcement 
made by the teacher. 
“We are going to spend the next two weeks on 
Problems in written English.” 
There is a little pause. Nothing has been said 
about those old bugbears — “‘themes,” or about 
“compositions.” This is something new. What 
does “she” mean? 
‘What do you suppose we are going to do?” 
No response. 
“Shall I tell you?” 
A vigorous affirmative. 
“Each one of us is going to do ten problems in 
theme-writing.” 
A few groans, low and stifled. 
“But it is going to be fun! There will be a 
long list of subjects posted in two places on the 
bulletin board. Each person will be free to 
choose any ten. You will be given most of the 
English period in which to do the work. Just as 
soon as you finish one problem, you will put it in

the wire basket here on my desk. I shall read it 
and mark any errors. If there is no grade at the 
top of the paper, you will have to rewrite your 
problem. When I think you have done the best 
you can with your subject, I shall grade it. 
“You will number your problems, and when 
you have had ten accepted, you will make a cover 
for the ten. On the cover you will write your 
name, the number of the problems, the number 
of times you wrote each problem before it was 
accepted, and the grade you received when it was 
rewritten. See, I have here on the blackboard a 
form for a completed cover.”

“ Ten ! ” 
‘Where shall you get your subjects?” 
“From the list on the bulletin board.” 
“Yes. Mary Margerum, how many times 
shall you rewrite your problems?” 
“Till you put grades on them.” 
“What shall you do with them then?” 
“Tl keep them till I have ten.” 
“Yes. What shall you do with those I return 
to be rewritten?” 
“T’ll keep those too.” 
“That’s the idea! What do you suppose you 
will do after you have made a book of the ten 
problems?” 
“Probably you will collect them to keep.” 
“That’s just what I plan todo! You see, you 
are really going to write some little books for me, 
and Iam going to help you towrite them correctly. 
Have you any questions to ask me? Robert 
Warfield?” 
“How long should the problems be?” 
“That is a good question. How long do you 
think they ought to be?” 
“About a page?” 
“Would they never be longer?” 
“Tf we had more to say, they would be 
longer.” 
88
-P-A-G-E-97
      DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
“T think so. Shall we agree that the problems 
are to be at least a page long, and as much longer 
as you wish?” 
Again a vigorous affirmative. 
“There is just one thing more. Of course the 
spelling will have to be perfect before the problem 
is accepted. Whenever I find a misspelled word, 
I shall put a circle around it, and a figure 10 in- 
side the circle. What do you suppose the ‘10’ 
will mean?” 
“Write the word ten times?” volunteers 
Grace O’Brien. 
“Yes, you will find out how the word should be 
spelled and write it ten times. Where can you 
find the correct spelling?” 
There is a chorus: “Look in the dictionary!” 
“Why do you suppose I want you to write 
misspelled words ten times?” 
Again the chorus: “So we shall not make the 
same mistake again!” 
Results of the Problem Method 
That spontaneity and a reasonable correctness 
of diction are not mutually exclusive qualities 
may be seen by examination of a few of these 
theme problems.

WHY I DON’T WANT TO GROW UP 
When you are a kid you have no responsibilities, 
and that means no worries. You can play around all 
day long without any one’s noticing you. You can 
get as dirty as you like without any one’s complain- 
ing that you are untidy. 
The best of it is that you don’t have to worry about 
housework at all. As soon as you grow up a little, 
however, you have mother scolding you because you 
don’t help in the house. At school you have the 
teachers scolding if you don’t do your homework. 
You don’t have time to play so much, and all the 
color in your cheeks disappears, and you have to buy 
some. That is why I don’t like to grow up. 
— Eva G—. 
THE ADVANTAGES OF SMILING 
How would you like to get a nice ten dollar gold 
piece as I did? Well, I'll tell you just how it hap- 
pened. I was at the lake one afternoon, with several 
friends, playing different games. It began to rain 
very hard, but we had brought no umbrellas, for we 
had not thought of rain when we came. The only 
thing to do was to run the half mile to the street car 
line. When we reached the road and the car was 
a short distance away a newspaper reporter with a 
camera called out to us that he wanted us to pose 
for him. He said he wanted to snap our picture, but 
the girls would not stop to pose for him. We envied 
90

him, because he had both an umbrella and an over- 
coat to protect him from the rain, and we did not 
even have our hats. Just as we reached the car I 
turned around and smiled at him. I saw him snap 
my picture. 
The next day, when the morning paper came out, 
what do you suppose I saw? My picture was there 
on the first page, while under it were printed in heavy 
type these words: “If this girl will report today at 
the ‘Telegram’ office she will receive a ten dollar gold 
piece.” :

THE TRIALS OF AN ONLY DAUGHTER 
Ihave chosen the above title because it happens to 
be my misfortune to be an only daughter, and I wish 
to convince those who think I am in luck that being 
an only daughter is not such a glorious thing. 
First of all you must not think mother will let you 
do anything you want to do. Why should she? 
You can’t go out very much, for father does not 
think it proper for you to go alone, and he is always 
too busy “just now” to go with you. You have no 
sisters or brothers, so — you'll just have to stay at 
home, that’s all! 
Some evening father has to go somewhere, then 
mother decides she must see how auntie’s baby is 
getting along. She is very sorry, but she thinks it is 
not best to take you. You'll just have to stay at 
home alone a little while “for once.”

And then the fun begins! 
You sit down with a book, but you can’t read. 
You imagine that some one is walking in the next 
room; a door slams shut; you jump — almost 
scream. You sit down again and try to be calm. 
You want a drink, but you are too scared to get one 
because some one might be in the pantry. It seems 
as though you sit there in the same place for several 
hours, hearing all kinds of sounds, wishing some one 
would come home, but no one comes. 
Now do you think it is so glorious to be an only 
daughter?

HAVING A DRESS FITTED 
My first experience in having a dress fitted is far, 
far beyond my recollection, in the dim, dim past. 
Nevertheless I can imagine how my mother must 
have fussed over me when I was a baby. I can pic- 
ture her to myself as she worked, cutting out tiny 
dresses and other garments for—me. I think she 
made them out of something they call canvas. No, 
it could not have been canvas, for I am sure that 
would have been too coarse. It must have been 
some finer material, I am sure, but I cannot at this 
moment think just what the name of that finer ma- 
terial is. 
I try to imagine myself just as I now look, but 
wearing one of those loose-fitting long dresses such 
as babies wear. I look not unnatural. Perhaps I

MY FIRST TELEGRAM 
On the first of April I was left all alone in the 
house. I did not know what else to do while my 
mother was gone, so I hunted up my tatting and went 
with it intomy ownroom. I had made about a half 
dozen loops when the front door bell rang. I thought 
some of the children were trying to play an April 
Fool trick on me, so I just stayed where I was. 
The bell rang again, so I thought I’d better walk to 
the window and try to see who it was. I looked 
through the curtains without parting them, and I 
saw a Western Union boy waiting impatiently for 
some one to take the telegram he was carrying. 
I dropped the tatting in the nearest chair and ran 
quickly to the door. The telegram was addressed to 
me! With excited fingers I tore open the envelope. 
Of course I expected to find something of real im- 
portance but all the message said was: “ April Fool!” 
It seems that my mother had heard me tell my 
chum that [had not yet been fooled. She just wanted 
to show me that it did not pay to boast too soon.

good and bad, taken from the work of pupils, 
helps to fix fundamentals. 
A theme problem is copied on the blackboard 
before the recitation begins. 
AN UNPREPARED RECITATION 
The home work was assigned in english to have 
an oral theme ready for the next day, to be recited. 
After school was let out I went home ate my din- 
ner. Then started to do my homework in algebra 
and my other study. When, I came to do the home 
work in English. I though it would be easy. So, I 
said to myself I’ll do it tomorrow before school. 
The next morning I awoke dressed up, ate, and 
started to school. When, I reached the school. I 
felt tired. So, I’ll let the oral theme go I said think- 
ing the teacher might not call on me to recite. 
The bell rang and I went from my science class to 
English. The teacher started to call on some of the 
pupils to recite their oral composition. I slid down 
in my seat hopping she wouldn’t call on me. More 
than half of the class had recited Then my name was 
called to recite my oral composition. I stood up be- 
side my seat and tried to think what to say, when the 
teacher ask if I had my orl theme. I told her I 
didn’t so she gave me zero for that day. 
A pupil-teacher, pointer in hand, acts as 
leader. 
“Does any one see anything to criticize in this 
94 
 
-P-A-G-E-103

problem?” he asks as soon as the class has had 
time to read it all. 
Every one is on his feet at once. 
“Stephen,” says the leader, “what do you 
see?” 
“¢English’ should be capitalized in the first 
paragraph,” says Stephen promptly. 
Stephen, and two other pupils sit. This was 
the criticism the other two also had in mind. 
“Clarence, what do you suggest?” says the 
leader. 
“Tt is better to say, ‘dismissed’ instead of ‘let 
out.’ The-second paragraph should begin, ‘After 
school was dismissed,’”’ declares Clarence. 
“Anything else? Mary.” 
“There should not be a comma between ‘when’ 
and the clause it introduces,” asserts Mary. 
“When I came to do the home work in English’ 
isn’t a sentence anyway. There should not bea 
period after ‘English.’ There isn’t any complete 
thought till the word ‘easy.’” 
“What mark of punctuation should there be 
after the word ‘English’ anyway?” asks the 
leader. 
“There should be a comma to make the mean- 
ing clear,” continues Mary. 
“What else?” prompts the leader. 
95

“¢Thought’ is misspelled; there should be a ‘t’ 
at the end of it,” volunteers Dorothy. 
“Tl do it tomorrow before school’ should be 
put in quotation marks,” observes George. “Why?” 
‘Well, isn’t the writer quoting what he said? 
It ought to have quotation marks around it.” 
The leader is a little uncertain. He looks 
toward the teacher for confirmation or negation. 
She merely nods in approval. George is satisfied, 
and the criticism proceeds. 
“*T awoke dressed up,’ sounds funny,” observes 
Stephen. 
“What is the matter with it?” 
“T think it would be better to put a comma 
after ‘awoke,’” suggests Joseph. “It makes 
some sense then.” 
“He doesn’t mean ‘dressed up,’” protests 
Stephen. ‘All he means is ‘dressed.’ Cross out 
the ‘up’; it isn’t needed.” 
“There is another quotation that ought to be 
put inside a set of quotation marks,” volunteers 
Esther. “‘T’ll let the oral theme go,’ is a 
quotation.” 
Again the leader is uncertain. Again the 
teacher nods her confirmation. 
“When I reached the school I felt tired,’ is all

one sentence,” says Anna. ‘There should be no 
period after ‘school.’ There is only one thought.” 
“Cross out the comma after ‘so,’” directs 
George. “It isn’t needed.” 
“There is only one ‘p’ in hoping,” says another 
boy. ‘“‘H-o-p-p-i-n-g’ spells ‘hopping’!” 
There is an amused ripple of laughter. Teacher 
laughs too. 
“Haven’t you missed something?” the teacher 
interrupts for the first time. 
The class studies the board most seriously. 
Some one discovers that “oral” has been spelled 
“9-r-1” in the sentence before the last, announces 
that interesting fact, and once more the criticism 
proceeds. 
When all the mistakes have been corrected, the 
teacher once more takes a hand in the game. 
“TIsn’t there anything good to say about the 
problem?” she suggests. 
The leader is again in charge. 
“It is interesting,” says some one. 
“Tt was a real experience,” says some one else; 
“he did not make it up.” 
“He makes us feel just the way he felt when it 
happened,” adds another. 
“He stopped writing when he had finished his 
story.” 
97

“He sticks to his subject.” , 
“Then the problem has ‘unity’?” suggests the 
teacher. 
A decided affirmative. Afterwards, pupils be- 
gin to look just a little more critically at their own 
problems before they are passed in. 
BLACKBOARD CORRECTION OF SPECIFIC ERRORS 
To supplement the problem work in written 
composition it is a good plan now and then to 
make a collection of separate slips of paper, each 
of which contains a sentence from some problem. 
These sentences will for the most part be faulty, 
but an occasional sentence of special merit may 
beintroduced. The slips are passed out to pupils 
who copy them on the blackboard. The first 
thing to do after all the sentences have been trans- 
ferred to the blackboard is to suggest a search for 
the one or two or three “good” sentences. As 
soon as these have been found, the class sets to 
work at “making over” the faulty sentences. By 
setting several groups to work at the same time on 
different sets of errors an element of competition 
may be introduced that adds zest to the exercise. 
The following sentences and parts of sentences 
are taken at random from material which the 
writer has used in this way with excellent results:

Use oF ComposiTION SCALES 
The Junior High School English teacher should 
have in her “‘tool-box” easily accessible copies of 
one or more of the better-known composition 
scales by means of which to test her pupils, and by 
means of which they can test themselves. The 
Hillegas, Hudelson, Willing, Nassau County, and 
Harvard-Newton scales are the most widely used. 
Any of these scales may be used either for evalu- 
ation of the work of a group or of an individual by 
the teacher, or for self-rating by the pupil him- 
self. 
Pupils like matching their own compositions 
with objective standards such as these, and they 
see more clearly after such comparisons what 
improvement is necessary in order to attain a 
higher score. The use of scales, self-rating or 
otherwise, puts marking on an impersonal, busi- 
ness-like basis, good alike for teacher and taught. 
Moreover, a judicious use of self-rating of prob- 
lems lightens the burden of the teacher while it 
helps the pupil to depend upon himself. 
The Thorndike Handwriting Scale may be used 
Ior
-P-A-G-E-110
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
advantageously in conjunction with one of the 
composition scales. 
All composition scales consist of a number of 
compositions arranged in order of merit, and a 
pupil’s effort is measured by matching it with that 
part of the scale which it approaches most nearly 
in value. 
The Willing Scale consists of a series of compo- 
sitions on the topic “An Exciting Experience,” 
composed as a class exercise, the time for which 
was limited to twenty minutes. The results were 
rated for form and for ‘‘story-value” and eval- 
uated arbitrarily from 20 to go. 
In using the scale, the conditions under which 
the original compositions were composed should 
be duplicated as closely as possible. 
All material needs should be anticipated before 
the test begins: good pens and ink, or plenty of 
pencils, sharpened and ready for use, should be 
provided; each pupil should have two sheets of 
theme paper (letter size). A list of the following 
topics is copied on the blackboard: 
An Exciting Experience. 
A Storm. 
An Accident. 
An Errand at Night. 
A Wonderful Story. 
102

DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
An Unexpected Meeting. 
In the Woods. 
In the Mountains. 
On the Ice. 
On the Water. 
A Runaway. 
The teacher then tells the pupils: 
“You are to write me a story about some excit- 
? ing experience which you have had, something 
very interesting that has happened to you. If you 
have never had such an experience, tell of an excit- 
ing experience which some one whom you know 
has had. You may make up astory, if you like, 
but you will probably do better with a real one. 
You will have twenty minutes in which to write. 
Use both sides of the paper, do all of the work 
yourselves, and ask no questions at all after you 
begin. Make any corrections you wish between the 
lines. You will not have time to rewrite your story. 
“You do not have to use the subjects on the 
blackboard unless you wish to. They are in- 
tended to help you out if you cannot think of any 
exciting experience. Begin now.” 
At the end of the twenty minutes, the teacher 
says to the pupils: “ You are to have five minutes 
now in which to finish the stories. Make cor- 
rections, and count the number of words. Write 
103 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
the number of words, your name, and age, at the 
end of your story.” 
Such were the original conditions under which 
the scale was made and the standards established. 
Compositions are rated first for “‘story-value,” 
then for “form-value.” During the first reading 
all errors of grammar, punctuation, capitalization, 
and spelling are neglected. Only the value of the 
story which the pupil is telling is kept in mind. 
As the different compositions are read, they are 
sorted into piles. Those in one pile approach 
most nearly the story-value of the theme rated 
20 on the scale, those in another are rated 30, 
still another 40, and soon. A second reading will 
reveal any errors in rating, and afford an oppor- 
tunity to make adjustments. Compositions are 
then marked. If the value of a composition 
seems to a teacher to lie between 30 and 40, for 
example, it may, of course, be rated as 35. 
Next, the compositions are re-read, all errors 
in grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and 
spelling are carefully marked. Such errors are 
counted, the number is multiplied by 100, and 
divided by the number of wordsinthestory. The 
result gives the number of errors per hundred 
words. These scores give the rating of any pupil 
in composition, and show clearly where emphasis 
104

  DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
needs to be placed in developing his power of 
written expression. 
A record of the scores of any class affords a 
teacher a concrete means of comparing the work 
of her class with any other to which the same test 
has been given. Compositions are again sorted 
into piles according to ‘‘story-value.” They are 
then tabulated as follows, the number belonging 
in each group being recorded:

Trabue’s Nassau County Supplement to the 
Hillegas Scale consists of nine compositions on 
“What I Should Like to Do Next Saturday.” 
All but two of these were written by pupils. 
This scale measures simply the content-value of 
the compositions. 
105
-P-A-G-E-114
EE 
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
The Hillegas Scale consists of ten compositions 
varying from an artificial theme with a value of 
zero to a composition rated at 9.3. Three of the 
ten compositions are artificial, five were written 
by high-school students, two by college freshmen. 
No two are on the same subject, and there is great 
variation in length and type. The Thorndike 
extension of this scale is more carefully graded, 
and better adapted for actual use. In it several 
compositions are given of each degree of merit in 
the middle of the scale. There are fifteen degrees 
of merit instead of the original ten, and twenty- 
nine compositions are thus graded. 
The Harvard-Newton Scale is divided into four 
parts, forming in reality a separate scale for each 
of the four rhetorical forms: narration, descrip- 
tion, exposition, and argumentation. In each 
scale there are six compositions written by eighth- 
grade pupils and arranged in order of merit as de- 
termined by the marks given them by teachers 
who rated them as eighth-grade themes. Sig- 
nificant points, whether merits or defects, are 
pointed out in the scale. 
The Hudelson Scale is made up of composi- 
tions written by first-year high-school pupils of 
Virginia in May, 1919, during the State Edu- 
cational Survey. This scale is based on the 
106°
-P-A-G-E-115
  DEVICES TO CULTIVATE POWER 
Nassau County Supplement. One thousand 
compositions were read by an experienced scorer. 
One hundred of these scored compositions, rang- 
ing from the poorest to the best, were selected, 
and again scored by ninety-six teachers of experi- 
ence. The Hudelson Scale therefore represents 
the median judgments of ninety-six teachers. 
Only the highest specimens in the scale were 
written by adults. 
To grade a set of problems by the Hudelson 
Scale a teacher should first become familiar with 
the specimens in the scale. She should study the 
specimen compositions to see why the ninety-six 
scorers ranked them as they did. Then, with the 
scale before her, she should rate a set of theme- 
problems, comparing each problem separately 
with the specimens till she finds the specimen 
to which the problem most nearly compares in 
general merit. The theme is then scored with the 
scale value of that specimen. For example, the 
theme read is better than 4.0, better than 4.5, 
better than 5.0, but not so good as the next 
composition, which ranks as 5.5. Nevertheless, 
it is nearer 5.0 than 5.5. Therefore the theme is 
given a score of 5.0. 
The median score for the whole class may be 
determined by arranging the themes in order of 
107
-P-A-G-E-116
O_O re 
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
merit and finding the score of the middle paper. 
If the number of papers is even, the median score 
lies halfway between the two middle papers. The 
scores are not based upon a per cent basis, but are 
measured from zero, which represents no value 
at all, tog.5. 7.0 is therefore twice as good a 
specimen as 3.5. 
A composition scale is not a teaching device, 
but is rather a measure of accomplishment. For 
individual ratings a scale may be used very often. 
Twice a year, however, is sufficiently often to 
measure the ability of a group in order to ascertain 
the degree of growth attained. Moreover, the 
intervals between such tests should be fairly 
regular, and the conditions should be uniform. 
In the new Junior High School, a departmental 
teacher of English can encourage a spirit of 
friendly rivalry between separate groups as an 
incentive to greater effort to increase their power 
of written expression, and so obtain a higher 
rating. 
When copies of the compositions belonging to 
a scale are posted on the English bulletin board 
for self-rating exercises, it is a good plan to have 
‘ them copied in longhand on the kind of paper 
used for theme-problems written by pupils. 
Copies of the scales may be obtained as follows:

The acquisition of power in oral expression, 
in the use of information printed in books and 
magazines, in effective, clear, self-expression 
through the medium of written English, may be 
fostered in the Junior High School by means of 
such devices and plans as have been described 
in the preceding pages, and by many other de- 
vices which the alert teacher will constantly dis- 
cover for herself. These powers may be tested 
from time to time by means of standard scales, 
and they may be put to immediate use through 
the correlation of English with the more informa- 
tive courses of the curriculum.

DEVICES TO TEACH FUNDAMENTAL 
FACTS 
SPELLING DEVICES 
The Use of Flash Cards 
For spelling “flash cards” or “perception cards” 
use manila tag board cut about five or six inches 
by nine inches. With black crayon write or 
print the word in large letters on one side of the 
card. On the other side in the upper left-hand 
corner write the same word in letters of normal 
size. Use the cards in sets of ten. They are 
particularly useful for drilling on short common 
words which are frequently misspelled. After an 
exercise in written English, it is a good plan to 
use the flash cards for drill on words misspelled 
on pupils’ papers. 
Flash the cards slowly before the class with 
the large letters toward the pupils. For a brief 
interval this exercise secures an absolute con- 
centration of attention, the effect of which never 
fails to last for some time after the exercise itself. 
Not till all ten cards have been flashed do the 
pupils write. As soon as the cards have all been 
IIo 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
FUNDAMENTAL FACTS 
displayed, and the set lowered, pupils write as 
many words as they can remember. The first 
time the cards are used in this way most of the 
class will remember six or seven words. Possibly 
one or two will have all ten. 
The words are then spelled orally by one of the 
pupils from his own list. 
Comparison with the oral spelling reveals the 
mistakes made. ‘The cards are then flashed a 
second time, in order to fix the “hard parts” of 
the words which gave trouble. 
After pupils have become accustomed to this 
sort of drill, most of them are able to write the 
entire list of ten after one ‘‘flashing,” while 
mistakes in spelling the words grow more rare. 
The drill cultivates memory as well as spelling 
ability, and has a psychological value greater 
than its content-value. The lists of words given 
in up-to-date spelling books are adapted to 
“flash-card” drills, but the writer has found 
that the best results come when the cards are 
made to fit the particular needs of the class with 
which they are used.

It has already been suggested, in connection

writing, that spelling blunders on written work 
grow steadily fewer in number when circles are 
drawn about misspelled words and a number, 
usually 10, written inside the circle. The pupil 
is then put to the trouble of looking up the word. 
in the dictionary, and of writing the correct form 
over and over. This simple device rapidly elim- 
inates the large number of spelling blunders which 
are due to carelessness rather than to ignorance. 
Dictation and Comparison 
This effective means for securing better spell- 
ing has the advantage of taking very little time, 
while at the same time children like the exercise, 
and profit by it. Such a spelling drill should be 
given either at the beginning or at the end of the 
literature period. Books are closed, writing 
materials are made ready, and ten or fifteen 
words, not previously studied, are dictated. 
After the dictation, a pupil reads his list orally, 
the teacher refers her class to a certain page in 
the literature text, and the pupils compare and 
mark their own lists. 
“What did you learn, Doris?” asks the 
teacher, when the comparison has been made. 
“There are two ‘s’s,’ but only one ‘c’ in the 
word ‘necessary,’” replies Doris.

“John?” 
“* Already’ is one word, and it has only one 
‘1,’” says John. 
All the discoveries made by the pupils are re- 
ported. In the mean time the teacher has been 
making a list of words which have been mis- 
spelled. These are kept for future drill work, or, 
if it seems wise to take the time for the purpose 
at once, the list is at once transferred to the 
blackboard, for immediate study. 
The method of study is suggested below under 
the next device given: 
Blackboard Work on Troublesome Words 
The list of words to be considered is placed on 
the board the day before the drill is conducted. 
Pupils copy the list. By way of preparation, 
they consult the dictionary, to ascertain the 
meanings of the words, and to discover how they 
may be divided into syllables. Sentences are 
prepared showing the correct use of the words. 
This part of the exercise is facilitated if the list 
is taken from literature, history, or community 
life text. 
The list given here is taken from Flagg’s

The teacher begins the drill by going over the 
list with her class in the following manner, em- 
phasizing the difficult part of each word. Point- 
ing to the first word, she asks: 
“What is the ‘hard part’ of this word?” 
Some one answers: 
“The two ‘I’s’ are the hard part of ‘usually.’” 
The teacher, with a yellow crayon, emphasizes 
the two “l’s” in the word “usually.” 
All other words in the exercise are similarly 
discussed. 
The class can now take care of itself, leaving 
the teacher free to attend to other matters, or to 
“listen in” on the spelling drill. A leader is 
chosen. The leader calls on a member of the 
class, who comes forward, erases any word he 
chooses (the words are never taken in order), and 
rewrites it at the right of the original list, dividing 
it into syllables. He then turns his back to the 
word, pronounces it, spells it orally, tells its

  FUNDAMENTAL FACTS 
to that fact, and the mistake is corrected. He 
then erases the word which he has written and 
returns to his seat, when the leader calls upon 
another pupil, and a similar procedure is again 
followed. The process is repeated till all the 
words have disappeared. Then the leader, from 
a list in his hand, pronounces the words for the 
written exercise. There are very few mistakes 
when the drill has reached this stage. 
Spelling Games 
I 
As in the preceding drill, the list is discussed, 
“hard parts” emphasized by colored crayon, and 
meanings are defined, either by direct definition, 
or by use of the words in sentences. Eraser in 
hand, the teacher says: 
“Shut your eyes!” 
A word is swiftly erased. 
“Eyes open!” 
Hands wave wildly. The teacher points to a 
boy at the back of the room. ‘What was the 
word, Henry?” 
“Tt was ‘courteous,’ c-o-u-r-t-o-u-s,” says 
Henry. 
“George!” 
115
-P-A-G-E-124
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
“Tt was ‘courteous,’ but it was spelled 
c-0-u-r-t-e-0-u-s,” affirms George. 
“yes closed again!” 
Another word — any word not immediately 
following “courteous” — is erased. 
“Eyes open!” 
So the game goes on till all the words have 
vanished, when the written exercise is given to 
test the actual mastery of the list. 
0m 
After the usual drill on the “hard parts” of 
the words, the list is erased, and the leader begins 
the game by saying: 
“T am thinking of a word which means ‘the 
act of carrying something from one place to an- 
other.’” 
“Ts it t-e-l-e-p-h-o-n-e, ‘telephone’?” asks an 
unthinking pupil. 
“No, it is not t-e-l-e-p-h-o-n-e, ‘telephone,’ ” 
replies the leader. “What do you think it is, 
James?” 
“Is it t-r-a-n-s-p-o-r-t-a-t-i-o-n, ‘ transporta- 
tion’?” says James. 
“Yes, it is t-r-a-n-s-p-o-r-t-a-t-i-o-n, ‘trans- 
portation,’” says the leader. 
Then James defines another word, and the 
116

  FUNDAMENTAL FACTS 
game of guessing and spelling the words goes on 
till the entire list has been used, after which the 
usual written exercise completes the spelling 
drill for the day. 
m1 
A slight variation of this game begins with the 
statement by the leader: 
“T am thinking of a word which begins 
with ‘o.’” 
“Ts it ‘ordinarily,’ o-r-d-i-n-a-r-i-l-y?” 
“Yes, it is ‘ordinarily,’ o-r-d-i-n-a-r-i-l-y.” 
The entire list is spelled in the same way.

Setting-up Exercises 
The canny teacher keeps a little memorandum 
book in which she records bad habits in the use of 
language. Most of these come to her ears as she 
passes through the corridors before school and at 
recess, or when she watches her charges at their 
games when they are off guard. Incorrect ex- 
pressions heard at home, or from companions, 
appear unwittingly in the classroom, too, in spite 
of the less spontaneous nature of such speech. 
117
-P-A-G-E-126
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
These bad habits have been acquired and 
fostered through frequent use and repetition of 
the offensive expressions. They have to be com- 
bated in the same way: through repetition of the 
correct formule to be substituted for them. 
“Setting-up exercises!” crisply announces the 
teacher. 
Everybody stands at attention. 
“Leave me go,” reads teacher from her little 
memorandum book. 
“Let me go,” responds the first pupil in the 
row at the left of the teacher. The pupil who 
has spoken sits. 
“T seen um,”’ quickly resumes the teacher. 
“T saw him,” comes the prompt response from 
the next pupil in the row. 
“T done the wrong problems.” 
“T did the wrong problems!” 
“Who did you see?” 
“Whom did you see!” 
“T could of went.” 
“T could have gone!” 
The setting-up exercise continues till every 
one in the class has had at least one opportunity 
to respond to the teacher’s quick challenge. 
Alertness is absolutely essential, and the drill 
must proceed with a snap, if it is to be successful. 
118
-P-A-G-E-127
FUNDAMENTAL FACTS 
Such setting-up exercises ought to precede the 
regular class work at least twice a week. 
After a little practice, a bright pupil can con- 
duct the drill quite as successfully as the teacher 
herself.

The Error Box 
The error box leads pupils to greater care in 
the use of the mother tongue. 
A pasteboard box with a cover in which a long 
slit has been cut is kept on the table in the Eng- 
lish room. Each day pupils bring to class slips 
of paper on which they have written expressions 
which they have heard on the street, at home, in 
the cars, etc. These slips are inserted in the 
error box through the slit in the cover. 
Time is taken during the English period to 
open the box and to discuss the expressions found 
therein. This discussion often reveals the fact 
that pupils think perfectly legitimate expressions 
are taboo. It brings out very queer prejudices in 
the matter of the use of language, and helps to 
dispel them. 
For example, pupils of the Junior High School 
age almost invariably say “between you and I,” 
and will put the correct form, ‘‘between you and 
119
-P-A-G-E-128
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
me,” in the error box, with such taboos as “I 
seen” and “TI done” and “I was goin’ some- 
place.” Discussion is needed to clear up such 
misconceptions, and drill is essential to fix the 
fact that one form is correct and that the other 
is not. 
The error box is valuable to the teacher as a 
source of material for the setting-up exercises, for 
her attention is called in this way to many errors 
in common use which might otherwise escape her 
attention. 
Pupils like the variety and “pep” that ac- 
company such drills as these, and because they 
are interested, they profit from them in large 
measure.

Gossip 
The class has been reciting the Ivanhoe assign- 
ment. A pupil-teacher has conducted the recita- 
tion, all troublesome points have been disposed 
of, and there are still ten minutes left for further 
use. 
“Let’s play a game of ‘Gossip,’” suggests the 
teacher. She addresses the first child in the row 
at her right. 
120 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
FUNDAMENTAL FACTS 
“T heard something yesterday!” 
“What was it?” asks the pupil. 
“T heard that Prince John was conspiring with 
the nobles to get King Richard’s throne away 
from him!” replies the teacher with the air of 
imparting a great secret. 
“Oh!” exclaims the pupil, as though she were 
greatly surprised. The pupil then turns to the 
boy next in the row, saying: “I heard something 
yesterday!” 
“What was it?” asks the boy with a great 
show of curiosity. 
“T heard that Prince John’s chances for getting 
his brother Richard’s throne are rather poor, 
because the nobles are already quarreling among 
themselves about the positions they are to hold 
when Prince John becomes king.” 
“Ts that so!” exclaims the boy, after which he 
in turn addresses the pupil in the next seat with 
the familiar refrain: “I heard something yester- 
day!” 
“What was it?” 
“T heard that Fitzurse was planning to have 
Prince John marry his daughter, Lady Alicia, 
but I heard that Prince John didn’t care much 
about Lady Alicia.” 
“My!” breathes the pupil thus addressed. 
121
-P-A-G-E-130
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
Then he also turns and, with the same prelimin- 
ary, “I heard something yesterday!” imparts 
some other vital fact from the story to the next 
pupil. 
The game of “‘Gossip,”’ it is obvious, helps to 
fix facts about the reading by means of repetition 
from a new angle. At the same time the proc- 
ess isso pleasant that the repetition has none 
of the usual deadening monotony that defeats 
its own ends. 
n 
Writing a Book 
This game is an adaptation of the old memory 
game of “Packing a Trunk to Go ona Vacation.” 
The leader begins with: “I wrote a book about 
Ivanhoe.” 
The next pupil repeats: “I wrote a book about 
Ivanhoe and Rowena.” 
The third pupil adds one more character to the 
list: “I wrote a book about Ivanhoe, Rowena, 
and Rebecca.” 
The next speaker adds a fourth character: “I 
wrote a book about Ivanhoe, Rowena, Rebecca, 
and Prince John.” 
Up to this point the game presents no diffi- 
culties, but when a fifth, then a sixth, then a 
122
-P-A-G-E-131
FUNDAMENTAL FACTS 
seventh character is added, remembering the 
names becomes more and more of a feat. The 
class tries to add as many names as possible 
without forgetting those which have gone before. 
When a pupil makes a mistake, the game is begun 
over again starting with the next pupil. Some 
one keeps the score, and great is the rejoicing 
when a pupil succeeds in remembering a longer 
list than any one has remembered before. In- 
cidentally, the main purpose of the game is ac- 
complished: the names of the characters in the 
book are fixed in the memory of the pupils, down 
to the least important minor character. 
I VY 
A Thinking Game 
The class has been reading Treasure Island. 
The teacher begins the game by saying: “I am 
thinking of some one who hid in an apple bar- 
rel and overheard an important conversation. 
Mary, of whom am I thinking?” 
“Ts it Jim Hawkins?” asks Mary. 
“Yes, it is Jim Hawkins.” 
“T am thinking of some one who had only one 
leg. Who is it, Henry?” 
“Ts it John Silver?” 
“Yes, it is John Silver.” 
123 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
Now it is Henry’s turn to “think.” 
“T am thinking of a man who talked too much. 
He couldn’t keep a secret. Who is it, Dorothy?” 
asks Henry. 
“Ts it Doctor Livesey?” 
“No, it is not Doctor Livesey. Bessie?” 
“Ts it the squire?” guesses Bessie. 
“Yes, it is the squire.” 
As the game proceeds, each pupil who has 
guessed successfully takes his turn at “thinking” 
of some action or characteristic by which some 
character in the story may be identified. If a 
pupil fails to guess the character, he loses his 
turn. 
One-W ord Tests 
One-word tests furnish a quick and easy method 
of showing a pupil what to notice in his reading. 
Such tests also provide a way to test pupils 
quickly and effectively in order to ascertain 
whether or not the reading has been done in- 
telligently. 
“One-word test,” announces the teacher. 
Pupils prepare a single sheet of pad paper for 
the test. The name is written at the head of the 
paper. 
“There will be ten questions, You will sim-

Number your answers. All ready? First: Who 
wrote The Lady of the Lake? 
“Second: What was the name of the Knight 
who was hunting when the story began? 
“Third: What was the name of the island? 
“Fourth: What was the name of the warrior 
who wanted to marry Ellen? 
“Fifth: What was her father’s name? 
“Sixth: What was the lake called? 
“Seventh: Who was the young man who came 
with Ellen’s father? 
“Eighth: How many nights did the stranger 
remain on the island? 
“Ninth: What adjective can you use to de- 
scribe Roderick? 
“Tenth: To whom did the island really belong? 
“That’s all. Now let us see how many we have 
answered correctly. Olive, suppose you read 
your list, while the rest of us check up.” 
Olive rises and reads her list: “Sir Walter 
Scott, James Fitz-James, Ellen’s Isle, Roderick 
Dhu, Douglas, Loch Katrine, Malcolm Graeme, 
one, hot-tempered, Roderick.” 
“Good!” says the teacher. ‘Olive has all of 
them right. Let’s see the hands of those who 
had all of them right. Good! All but one

-P-A-G-E-134
    JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
correct? All but two? Perhaps some of us had 
another word for the ninth that was just as good 
as ‘hot-tempered.’ ‘Hasty’? That is all right. 
‘Bad-tempered’? ‘Irritable’? ‘Excitable’? 
‘Quarrelsome’? Those are all good words! 
‘Irascible’? That’s fine! Where did you get 
that word? It’s just the right word to describe 
Roderick’s peppery temper, however. Now 
we'll mark our papers. What mark shall you 
put at the top of your paper if you have one 
wrong? ‘That’s it, 90 per cent. Ten times the 
number you have answered correctly! Pass the 
papers forward!” 
In five to seven minutes the entire class has 
been quizzed as to knowledge of the facts in 
Canto I of The Lady of the Lake, the delinquent 
have seen wherein they were ignorant, and the 
remainder of the time is free for real teach- 
ing, instead of monotonous “hearing of recita- 
tions.” 
Srx TyPEs OF QUESTIONS 
Making their own questions helps pupils to 
notice and remember the important facts treated 
in the reading. This phase of the English work 
has already been touched on in the discussion 
of the socialized recitation. The plan is intro- 
126 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  
FUNDAMENTAL FACTS 
duced by a discussion of the types of questions 
which will produce the most clean-cut results. 
“Describe” and “Tell” and “Explain” are too 
vague to be used as introductory words. Ques- 
tions to be answered by “Yes” or “No” are 
taboo. “Why” and “How” will often pro- 
voke discussion due to differences of opinion. 
“What,” “When,” “Where,” “Who,” questions 
always bring forth definite facts — unless they 
betray ignorance! 
A four-line rhyme by Kipling, which appears as 
a chapter heading to the “Story of the Elephant’s 
Child” in the Just-So Stories, will be useful to 
teachers in emphasizing the point that the form 
of the question is important. 
Recitations in which the pupil-teacher occupies 
a prominent position are most effective in em- 
phasizing the important facts of an assignment 
when any departure from these six question 
forms is strictly censored. 
The following questions from ninth-year work 
on Shakespeare’s Julius Cesar illustrate the type 
of work that can be done:

Punctuation DEVICES 
I 
Dictation and Comparison 
Suppose the teacher wishes to present a rule 
for punctuation; for example, the rule for the use 
of double quotation marks. 
She announces that there will be a dictation 
exercise. A passage illustrating the rule is dic- 
tated from the exercise book, or from the litera- 
ture text. Pupils are then told to open their books 
at the proper page, and to compare their own 
punctuation with that in the book. There are sev- 
eral busy moments of comparison and correction. 
129

“Has any one learned something new?” asks 
the teacher. 
There is a show of hands. 
“Donald?” 
“T learned that I should have put a comma at 
the end of the ‘quoted part’ as well as another 
quotation mark,” says Donald. 
“Grace?” 
“The part inside the quotation marks begins 
with a capital letter.” 
After the teacher has found out what her pupils 
have “learned” by the exercise, she is ready for 
the second step. 
Another dictation exercise is given, quite sim- 
ilar to the first. How many mistakes this time? 
There are only two or three. The brighter pu- 
pils are instructed to show their slower mates 
just what is wrong with their work. Then 
perhaps the teacher decides to give still a third 
dictation. Sometimes the third trial is not 
needed. Then the class is ready for a brisk black- 
board exercise during which quotation marks are 
supplied in a series of sentences lacking them.

tion it is best to take sentences from the themes

as these drive home the point and add zest to the 
work, at the same time that they offer an induce- 
ment to the pupil to be more careful next time in 
censoring his own punctuation.

SocraLizeD GRAMMAR DRILLS 
This exercise happens to be a drill on the use 
of pronouns, but the same general treatment 
may be given any similar drill in grammar. In 
this case the pupil’s task is to choose between 
131
-P-A-G-E-140
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
two forms, fill in a blank with the proper form, 
then explain the reason for her choice. What 
could be more dull? 
Mary reads the sentence glibly, choosing 
whom, rather than who, but is uncertain as to 
the reason for her choice. The sentence is: 
“The man whom you see is my brother Louis.’ 
“JT don’t know why I used whom,” Mary 
admits. 
“Who does know why she chose whom?” the 
teacher asks. 
Daniel’s hand is raised. 
“Can you ask Mary some questions that will 
help her to see why she chose whom, Daniel?” 
Daniel is more than willing to make the in- 
teresting attempt. So he begins bravely: 
“Is whom in the main sentence, or is it in a 
clause?” 
Mary: “It is in a clause.” 
Daniel: ‘What is the clause?” 
Mary: “The clause is ‘Whom you see. 
Daniel: “‘What is the subject of the clause?” 
Mary: “The subject is you.” 
Daniel: ‘‘And the predicate?” 
Mary: “The predicate is see.” 
Daniel: “What is the object?” 
Mary: “The object is Louis!” 
132 2”
-P-A-G-E-141
  FUNDAMENTAL FACTS 
Poor Daniel! He is chagrined! The class 
laughs, but Daniel is not at all ready to give 
up. He resumes the attempt with a manner of 
stubborn determination. 
Daniel: “Read the clause by itself, putting 
the subject first.” 
Mary: “You see whom.” 
Daniel: “Well, suppose it read, ‘You see 
Louis.’ Then what would the subject be?” 
Mary: ‘The subject would be you.” 
Daniel: ‘‘And the predicate?”’ 
Mary: “The predicate would be see.” 
Daniel: ‘‘And the object?” 
Mary: ‘“‘The object would be Louis.” 
Daniel: “But the clause really is, ‘You see 
whom.’ What is the object now?” 
Mary: “The object is whom. Oh, I see now 
why I used whom! I had to have the objective 
case!” 
So Daniel relaxes happily, Mary understands, 
the teacher smiles, and the drill proceeds merrily, 
and not so dully, either! 
Another sentence causes some trouble: “She 
asked Helen and myself to go for the flowers.” 
Some one changes the sentence to: “She asked 
Helen and J to go for the flowers.” 
The class protests violently. 
133
-P-A-G-E-142
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
“How do you think it ought to go, Loretta?” 
asks the teacher. 
“T’d say, ‘She asked Helen and me to go for 
the flowers.’”’ 
“Can you make Martha see why you are 
right?” 
“Yes, I can!” 
Something like the following dialogue takes 
place: 
Loretta: “What is the subject?” 
Martha: “The subject is She.” 
Loretta: “What is the predicate?” 
Martha: “The predicate is asked.” 
Loretta: “How is Helen used in the sen- 
tence?” 
Martha: “Helen is the object of asked.” 
Loretta: “Is there any other object?” 
Martha: “Oh, yes, me is the object too.” 
Loretta: “Why is J incorrect?” 
Martha: “J is in the nominative case, and 
can’t be used as the object of a verb.” 
Loretta: “Why is myself incorrect?” 
Martha: “Myself is the intensive form. We 
don’t need it here.” 
Martha understands, for she really did her own 
thinking. Loretta feels a warm glow of satisfac- 
tion. Both pupils have fixed a little more firmly

  SUMMARY 
THE devices which are here presented for the use 
of the English teacher in the Junior High School 
represent practical efforts to make over class- 
room methods to fit pupils as they are rather than 
pupils as the teacher would like to have them. 
These devices recognize the necessity for coax- 
ing the adolescent mind into action, and they 
take cognizance of the fact that “joy in work” is 
the most powerful of lures. 
The three chief/functions of all Junior High 
School English work — to cultivate appreciation, 
to increase power, and to teach facts — may be 
attained to a large degree by the judicious use of 
devices. Frequently a single device will serve 
all three ends. 
No device should be overworked. The more 
variety a teacher can secure, the greater will be 
the net result.

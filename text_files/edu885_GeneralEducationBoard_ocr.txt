INTRODUCTORY NOTE 
This volume gives an account of the activities of the 
General Education Board from its foundation in 1902 up to 
June 30, 1914. The Board has made annual reports to the 
United States Department of the Interior and these have 
been regularly printed in the reports of the Department; 
but no further report has been hitherto issued, because, as 
the Board’s work was felt to be experimental in character, 
premature statements respecting the scope and outcome of 
its efforts were to be avoided. After something more than 
a decade, tangible results have begun to appear, and to their 
description and consideration the following pages are devoted, 
Henceforth, statements will be issued annually, and, from 
time to time, a more critical discussion like the present report 
will be published.

The General Education Board 
I. HISTORY OF THE GENERAL 
EDUCATION BOARD 
HE General Education Board, founded by John 
D. Rockefeller, began informally when, on the 
evening of January 15, 1902, a few of those who 
subsequently became its members met for the purpose 
of discussing the probable scope and methods of an edu- 
cational organization, the creation of which Mr. Rocke- 
feller was then contemplating. At a second meeting, 
held in the following month, and attended by Messrs. 
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., F. T. Gates, W. H. Baldwin, Jr., 
J. L. M. Curry, Robert C. Ogden, Daniel C. Gilman, 
Walter H. Page, Albert Shaw, and Wallace Buttrick,? 
the counsel, Edward M. Shepard, submitted articles of 
association under which the Board began its pre- 
liminary operations. Incorporation by Act of Congress 
took place January 12, 1903. The charter? set forth the 
general object of the corporation as “the promotion of 
education within the United States of America, without 
distinction of race, sex, or creed”; and this broad object 
1Mr. Morris K. Jesup, who had attended the first meeting, was un- 
avoidably absent from the second.

4 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
was specifically stated to include the power to establish 
or endow elementary or primary schools, industrial . 
schools, technical schools, normal schools, training schools 
for teachers, or schools of any grade, or higher institu- 
tions of, learning; to codperate with associations engaged. 
in éducational work; to donate property or money to any 
such association; to collect educational statistics and 
information, to publish and distribute documents and 
reports, (fand \in general to do and perform all things 
necessary or convenient for the promotion of the object 
of the corporation.” Under the authority thus conferred, 
the entire. field. of: education in the United States—taking 
the word education i in its broadest significance—is open 
to the General Education Board. The Board can em- 
ploy its resources in supplementing the income of estab- 
lished institutions of learning; it can codperate with state 
and local authorities as well as with private organiza- 
tions; it can undertake educational experimentation 
along new and hitherto untried lines, whether at the pri- 
mary, academic, technical, industrial, or professional 
level; it can conduct educational research and dissemi- 
nate educational data. 
MEMBERSHIP 
The membership of the Board has from the outset 
been selected with distinct reference to the varied and 
weighty responsibilities involved.1. It was recognized 
that the feasibility of codperation between private and

HISTORY OF THE BOARD 5 
governmental agencies and the large opportunity open 
to individual initiative in dealing with social and educa- 
tional problems are among the distinct advantages of a 
democratic social order. But the usefulness of any par- 
ticular effort in these directions must depend on the 
wisdom with which it is conducted—i. e., on the com- 
petency and disinterestedness of those charged with its 
direction. Where a high order of capacity and experi- 
ence is thus enlisted, it is not too much to say that com~- 
plete responsibility to professional and public opinion 
is joined with equally complete independence of personal, 
sectional, or institutional interests. Foreign observers 
of American conditions have repeatedly commented 
with something like envy on the comparative ease with 
which large sums have been brought into fruitful use 
under a form of supervision, which aims to bring to- 
gether in one Board both the lay and the professional 
points of view, and to represent every phase of social and 
educational concern. The devotion of private fortunes 
to public ends on these terms is highly desirable; and 
leaders in social and educational endeavor can and do 
render intelligent and patriotic service by participation 
in these characteristically American enterprises. 
RANGE OF ACTIVITIES 
The creation of the General Education Board marked 
the coming together and expansion of two distinct lines of 
interest and activity.

6 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
(a) Higher Education 
Prior to 1902 Mr. Rockefeller had confined his educa- 
tional benefactions mainly to such institutions as were 
conducted under the auspices of his own religious de- 
nomination. For this purpose he had acted through 
the American Baptist Education Society, an organiza-- 
tion which fostered academies, colleges, and theological 
seminaries under Baptist auspices throughout the United 
Statesand Canada. The institutions thus assisted form, 
in the main, the contribution of the Baptist denomination 
to the general educational resources of the nation. In 
this spirit the Society had in 1889 determined on the 
establishment of the University of Chicago, a decision 
the fulfilment of which, on the broad lines laid down at 
the outset, was subsequently realized chiefly through 
Mr. Rockefeller’s gifts.1_ The Baptist Education Society 
aided only institutions which were affiliated with its own 
denomination, and of these, such only as gave promise 
of permanent and increasing usefulness. A plan of edu- 
cation under Baptist auspices had been somewhat care- 
fully elaborated, which was designed to furnish the 
Baptist denomination of the United States with a 
comprehensive and orderly system of colleges and 
academies. For a decade or more the Society wrought

Mz. Frederick T. Gates, the Corresponding Secretary, in report of First 
Annual Meeting of the American Baptist Education Society, May 18, 
1889. Mr. Rockefeller’s gifts to the University of Chicago total 
$34,702,375.28.
-P-A-G-E-20
HISTORY OF THE BOARD 7 
with diligence and success toward the realization of 
this denominational system of education, Mr. Rocke- 
feller being the chief benefactor. But as Mr. Rocke- 
feller’s fortune increased, his interest in education 
broadened, and with it a sense of public duty and respon- 
sibility which transcended alike denominational, sectional, 
and racial lines. To provide an agency through which 
the broadest possible interest in education throughout 
the land could find a fitting expression, the General 
Education Board, long existing as an ideal in his office, 
finally came into being. Without limitation the funds 
of the General Education Board were to be distributed 
to institutions of any denomination or no denomination. 
Moreover, the scope of the Board was designed to 
include activities with which the Baptist Society had 
not undertaken to deal. Nevertheless, the historic re- 
lationship between the two organizations is clear. The 
General Education Board is, on this side, an outgrowth 
of the Baptist Education Society. The Board adopted 
the main principles and practices of the Baptist So- 
ciety and extended them, dropping the denominational 
and other limitations. It took over the conception of a 
system of higher education, comprehensive, mutually 
related, and supplemental in its parts, so expanded, 
however, as to cover institutions with and without 
denominational connections.1_ The Board adopted, too 
the manner in which the Baptist Society had made

tributions of the Board to universities and colleges, pp. 108-112.

its contributions, and even the precise form of pledge 
that had been employed.! 
(6) Education in the South 
Vigorous interest in the industrial and educational 
upbuilding of the South represented the second of the two 
lines of activity which merged in the General Education 
Board. The Southern states were making unprece- 
dented efforts toward their own educational rehabilita- 
tion. In these efforts valuable assistance had already 
been rendered by several private foundations and organ- 
izations created for the express purpose of codperating 
with the Southern people. The most prominent of these 
bodies were the Peabody Education Fund, the Trustees 
of the Slater Fund, and the Southern Education Board. 
They were all non-official in character and either endowed 
or entirely supported by private funds. Neither they nor 
the General Education Board ever possessed or sought 
authority; they have simply had such influence as has 
resulted from public confidence in their disinterested 
devotion, sympathy, and intelligence. More flexible 
than governmental bureaus, less restricted in their choice 
of agents and advisers, more continuous in policy, these 
organizations have for years devoted themselves to 
furthering educational plans which represent the con- 
sensus of the best judgment obtainable. So important 
has been the part played by these bodies in the upbuilding   
1This is explained fully in the section devoted to colleges and univer- 
sities, pp. 144-147.
-P-A-G-E-22
HISTORY OF THE BOARD 9 
of Southern education since the war, and so intimate 
their relationship with the General Education Board, 
that a word may fitly be said of them in this connection. 
THE PEABODY EDUCATION FUND 
The Peabody Education Fund—something above 
$2,000,000—was established, shortly after the close of 
the war, by George Peabody, a native of Massachusetts, 
who subsequently became a London banker. The Fund 
was designed for the promotion of popular education in 
the Southern states through codperation with state 
and local officials. Subject to a representative body of 
trustees, three general agents were successively engaged 
in this work: Dr. Barnas Sears, sometime president of 
Brown University, Dr. J. L. M. Curry of Virginia, and 
Dr. Wickliffe Rose of Tennessee. The Peabody Board, 
through its general agents, assisted the educational lead- 
ers of the several states in creating sentiment and pro- 
curing legislation favorable to popular education; it 
aided in the establishment of public schools in cities and 
towns, and in the development of state normal schools, 
in the support of Hampton Institute, Tuskegee Institute, 
and other private schools for Negroes, and finally con- 
tributed the bulk of its capital ($1,500,000) to the new | 
George Peabody College for Teachers, affiliated with 
Vanderbilt University at Nashville. In combining 
private and unofficial with public and official endeavor, 
the George Peabody Fund was the pioneer educational 
foundation. Its general agents were often invited to
-P-A-G-E-23
Io THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
address joint sessions of the legislatures of the several 
Southern states; and its efforts were repeatedly recog- 
nized in legislative enactments. An Alabama statute, 
for example, provided that the State Superintendent of 
Education should hold teachers’ institutes every summer 
in each congressional district and authorized him to ex- 
pend in each district ‘‘not to exceed $500, the amount not 
in any case to exceed the amount paid for such purpose 
by the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund.” The 
history of this endowment indicates the lines on which - 
codperation between unofficial and official agencies may 
be effectively carried on. 
THE JOHN F. SLATER FUND 
The Slater Fund, originally $1,000,000, but well-nigh 
doubled by wise management, was left by the late John 
F. Slater, a manufacturer of Norwich, Connecticut. Its 
purpose was the development of educational facilities 
for the Negro. Bishop Haygood, sometime president 
of Emory College, Georgia, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, Dr. Wal- 
lace Buttrick, and Dr. James H. Dillard of New Orleans, 
Louisiana, served in succession as general agent. The 
Fundcontributed fromits income to thesupport of normal 
schools, denominational schools, and many town schools 
for Negroes. It was of material aid in developing the 
Trade Schools at Hampton and Tuskegee, the Hospital 
and Teacher Training Departmentsat Spelman Seminary, 
the industrial work at Claflin University, and many other 
institutions. Throughout its history special emphasis

HISTORY OF THE BOARD 1 
has been laid on the training of the hands and on what is. 
now popularly known as vocational education. Under 
the direction of Dr. Dillard, the present general agent, 
the attention of the Board is more and more being con- 
centrated on the rural schools.' 
THE SOUTHERN EDUCATION BOARD 
The Southern Education Board, organized by the 
late Robert C. Ogden, was an outgrowth of the Annual 
Conference for Education in the South. The object 
of both these organizations will be more definitely stated 
when rural educational conditions are described.? They 
must, however, be mentioned at this point because the 
propaganda in behalf of popular education in the South 
carried on by them was a factor in crystallizing Mr. 
Rockefeller’s already profound interest in this particular 
problem on the establishment of the General Education 
Board. 
The organizations above described were either limited 
1 Two additional funds have been created in recent years for the benefit 
of Negro education: the Anna T. Jeanes Fund for Negro Rural Schools, 
and the Phelps-Stokes Fund. Miss Jeanes, a native of Pennsylvania, 
after giving $200,000 in trust to the General Education Board (see p. 202), 
the income to be expended on Negro rural schools, gave $1,000,000 to a 
Board organized at her request by Dr. H. B. Frissell and Dr. Booker T. 
Washington. Dr. Dillard is president of the Board and director of the 
Fund, which is now utilized to maintain county supervising industrial 
teachers, coéperating with the public school authorities. See pp. 196-8. 
The Phelps-Stokes Fund, approximately $1,000,000, left by Miss 
Caroline Phelps Stokes to a Board of Trustees, is now supporting out of 
its income a study of leading Negro schools and colleges, and certain fel- 
lowships at the University of Georgia and the University of Virginia for 
the study of the Negro problem.

Board. It was obvious, therefore, that there was room for 
still another type of institution—an institution petma- 
nent in character, and with an assured income, devoted 
in part, at least, to codperation with the Southern people 
in the development of a comprehensive educational 
policy. For some years previous to the organization of 
the General Education Board, Mr. Rockefeller’s atten- 
tion had been directed to the needs of the people of the 
South, both white and colored, and particularly to the 
existing conditions in respect to elementary education. 
Its charter was so drawn as to enable the General Edu- 
cation Board to enter this field. While the precise part 
to be undertaken was not defined in advance, Mr. Rocke- 
feller, in making his first gift to the Board, called at- 
tention to the educational needs of the people of the 
Southern states and indicated his special interest therein. 
EDUCATIONAL SURVEY OF THE SOUTH 
Accordingly, the Board, through its Secretary, as- 
sisted by several field agents, at once set to work to 
acquire a thorough knowledge of conditions in the South- 
ern states. To use the phrase now current, surveys were 
planned, state by state. In the fall of 1902 a conference 
of the County Superintendents of Georgia was held at 
the State University at Athens. Among the questions 
informally discussed were finance, supervision, school 
consolidation, Negro education, etc. Similar confer-

ences in Virginia, the Carolinas, Florida, and other states 
followed. Subsequently, detailed field studies were made 
and separate state monographs prepared, dealing with 
the organization of the public school system, its finances, 
the number and character of school buildings, the num- 
ber, training, and pay of public school teachers, private 
and public secondary schools, institutions for the higher 
education of women, schools for the training of teachers, 
and schools, public and private, for the education of 
Negroes. 
These monographs were distributed to members of the 
General Education Board and were kept on file in the 
office of the Board. They were not published, because no 
good purpose was at that time to be subserved thereby. 
However, in little more than the decade that has passed 
since that time, the general educational situation in 
the Southern states has been so largely transformed 
that the facts contained in these documents now possess 
considerable historic interest. In subsequent pages they 
will be utilized by way of showing the rapid improve- 
ments that have taken place. 
POLICY OF THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
But the studies just referred to did more than supply 
facts. For out of them a conclusion of far-reaching 
importance soon emerged. They convinced the Board 
that no fund, however large, could, by direct gifts, con- 
tribute a system of public schools; that even if it were

possible to develop a system of public schools by private 
gifts, it would be a positive disservice. The best thing 
in connection with public school education is the doing 
of it. The public school must represent community 
ideals, community initiative, and community support, 
even to the point of sacrifice. The General Education 
Board could be helpful only by respecting this funda- 
mental truth. It therefore felt its way cautiously, con- 
scious of the difficulty, complexity, and delicacy of the 
situation. It hoped to aid, not by foisting upon the 
South a program from outside, but by codperating with 
Southern leaders in sympathetically working out a pro 
gram framed by them on the basis of local conditions and 
local considerations. The several steps taken in con- 
sequence of this attitude will be described in detail in 
this volume. It will be observed that the Board has 
scrupulously maintained the position above defined: 
it has codperated, not interfered. The lines on which 
codperation could profitably take place have been ar- 
rived at as the result of conference between national, 
state, and local authorities, competent unofficial ob- 
servers, and the officers and members of the General 
Education Board. The experience of over a decade has 
conclusively proved that on this basis endowed agencies 
can perform valuable public service in a democracy.

II. RESOURCES AND EXPENDITURES 
ENDING the steps necessary to incorporation, 
Mr. Rockefeller in 1902 gave $1,000,000 to the 
General Education Board. In making his in- 
itial gift,| Mr Rockefeller referred to the fact that he 
understood it to be the immediate intention of the Board 
to devote itself to studying the needs and aiding to 
promote the educational interests of the people of the 
Southern states It was stipulated that the principal 
be used in the Southern states and that it be expended 
during a period of ten years. 
GIFTS TO ENDOWMENT 
The first permanent endowment, received June 30, 
1905, and amounting to $10,000,000, was expressly de- 
signed to furnish an income ‘‘to be distributed to, or 
used for the benefit of, such institutions of learning, at 
such times, in such amounts, for such purposes, and under 
such conditions, or employed in such other ways as 
the Board may deem best adapted to promote a compre- 
hensive system of higher education in the United States.’”? 
1Mr. Rockefeller’s letters announcing his gifts to the General Education 
Board, with the letters of the Board in reply, are given in full in Appendix 
TL, pp. 216-223. 
2The limitations on the use of this gift were subsequently removed.

-P-A-G-E-29
16 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
In February, 1907, a further gift of $32,000,000 was 
made, “one third to be added to the permanent endow- 
ment of the Board; two thirds to be applied to such 
specific objects within the corporate purposes of the 
Board” as Mr. Rockefeller or Mr. John D. Rockefeller, 
Jr., might direct, “the remainder not so designated, at the 
death of the survivor, to be added to the permanent en- 
dowment ofthe Board.”! © This addition to endowment 
was accompanied by no restriction whatsoever as to the 
specific educational objects to which its income was to 
be devoted. 
On July 7, 1909, Mr. Rockefeller increased his bene- 
factions by the gift of an additional $10,000,000, at the 
same time authorizing and empowering the Board, in its 
discretion, to distribute its entire principal or any part 
thereof, and releasing the Board from the obligation to 
hold his gifts in perpetuity. Besides the sums above 
specified as contributed by Mr. Rockefeller, the Board re- 
ceived, April 17, 1905, the sum of $200,000 from Miss 
Anna T. Jeanes for the “‘assistance of the Negro rural 
schools in the South.’’? 
At the present time the Board’s resources are valued at 
$33,939,156.89, of which $30,918,063.80 is general endow- 
ment and $3,021,093.09 reserve fund. The gross income

In addition the Anna T. Jeanes Fund of $200,000 yielded 
a gross income of $9,231.64. 
APPROPRIATIONS 
In accordance with the terms of its charter, the Board 
has initiated several distinct, though related, lines of 
activity which will be described in this volume. Its

Il. FARM DEMONSTRATIONS 
T WILL be remembered that Mr. Rockefeller’s first 
gift to the General Education Board was designed to 
support an inquiry into the educational needs of the 
Southern people. To the officers and members of the 
Board who visited the South for personal study, it soon 
became clear that more favorable economic conditions 
must be attained before comprehensive school systems 
could be supported by taxation. The Southern people 
were not educationally apathetic; on the contrary, popu- 
lar education, unknown to the antebellum régime, 
had come to be an object of ardent desire in the three 
decades that had passed between 1870 and 1900; sig- 
nificant steps had already been taken in many states, and 
generous private subscriptions were being added to public 
taxation. But adequate developments could not take 
place until the available resources of the people were 
greatly enlarged. School systems could not be given to 
them, and they were not prosperous enough to support 
them. Such was the situation reduced to its simplest 
terms. 
EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH 
A few of the facts gathered at the time by the Board will 
make this point clear. The state school fund of Alabama 
18

-P-A-G-E-33
FARM DEMONSTRATIONS 19 
for the year ending September 30, 1903, was $1,167,887.90; 
in Georgia, the total from both state and local sources 
was somewhat less; the total net disbursements of Missis- 
sippi that year were a little less than $1,900,000; in Ten- 
nessee, expenditures were slightly in excess of $2,600,000. 
The remaining Southern states did not vary materially 
from the examples cited. These sums were obviously 
inadequate to their purposes. In some states they in- 
cluded amounts raised by local taxation; but in general, 
local levies were either impossible or were confined by 
statute to very narrow limits. 
The real difficulty became strikingly apparent when 
the details essential to the organization and conduct of a 
school system were examined. Salaries were uniformly 
low and clerical assistance extremely meagre. The State 
Superintendent of Alabama was paid $2,500 annually, 
with a total allowance for clerks of $4,400; in North 
Carolina, $2,000 and $2,500 respectively were appropri- 
ated; in South Carolina, $1,900 and $900; in Tennessee, 
$2,000 and $1,920. Georgia prescribed no qualifications 
forits State ‘‘ Commissioner of Education’; in Mississippi, 
only an age qualification existed; Tennessee made a 
vague professional requirement; Virginia specified in 
general terms ‘‘an experienced educator.” 
Matters were even less satisfactory in respect to the 
county superintendency. The average salary of these 
officers in Alabama in 1902 was $575 a year; in Louisi- 
ana, $482; in Virginia, $399.75. Clearly the county su- 
perintendent could not as a rule devote himself wholly to
-P-A-G-E-34
20 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
his educational duties, and it was not to be expected that 
the post would usually be filled by specially trained men. 
At this same period the white teachers of Alabama 
were receiving average annual salaries of $151.84; col- 
ored teachers, $95.53; in South Carolina, $195.28 and 
$79.47 respectively; in Louisiana, white and colored 
together, $254. The average throughout the United 
States was at this time $516. The per capita expenditure 
on school children ranged from $3.38 in North Carolina 
to $7.43 in Louisiana, while in the country at large it 
stood at $15.08. In Georgia, the county school term 
averaged 5.2 months; in Mississippi, a four-months’ term 
was required by statute; in Tennessee, the county term 
varied from fifty-five days in Claiborne County to one 
hundred and forty-five in Bedford; the statutory require- 
ment in Virginia was a term of five months or 100 days.’ 
Under these circumstances the entire organization 
was necessarily inefficient and unsatisfactory. The sal- 
aries were too low to support a teaching profession and 
the terms too brief to engage the time and energy of the 
teacher; competent professional training could not ex- 
ist, satisfactory equipment could not be provided, and, if 
provided, could not be utilized. A well-organized state 
system, conducted by properly qualified officials effi- 
ciently supervising comfortable schools in charge of 
trained teachers during a term of sufficient length, did not 
a decade ago exist in any Southern state.

UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
But, as has already been stated, these conditions were 
not primarily due to any lack of interest in popular edu- 
cation. They were mainly the result of rural poverty. 
While the average annual earnings of individuals en- 
gaged in agriculture in the State of Iowa were upward 
of $1,000, the average earnings of those similarly engaged 
in some of the Southern states were as low as $150. 
Nor were these meagre agricultural incomes supple- 
mented by disproportionately large returns from mines or 
manufactures. Eighty-five per cent. of the Southern 
population was rural in character. Trade did not there- 
fore supply what the farm failed to produce. The great _ 
bulk of the people of the Southern states was simply not 
earning enough to provide proper homes and to support 
good schools. Whatever the other deficiencies, the 
prime need was money. 
It was obvious that the General Education Board could 
render no substantial educational service to the South 
until the farmers of the South could provide themselves 
with larger incomes. The resources of the soil were 
_ ample or would become so under scientific cultivation; 
the climate was highly favorable to general rural pros- 
perity. But the Southern farmer suffered from lack of 
scientific knowledge of agriculture, knowledge available, 
indeed, though never effectually distributed to the 
people. It was necessary to improve Southern agricul- 
ture. How could this be done?
-P-A-G-E-37
22 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
The Board was advised to address itself to the rising 
generation—that is, to support the teaching of agricul- 
ture in the common schools. After thoughtful consid- 
eration this plan was rejected. In the absence of trained 
teachers, the effort was impracticable; moreover, there 
were no funds with which to pay such teachers, and the 
instruction itself would not materially contribute to its 
own support. Finally, it was impossible to force intelli- 
gent agricultural instruction upon schools whose patrons 
were not themselves alive to the deficiencies of their own 
agricultural methods. Until the public was convinced 
of the feasibility of superior and more productive meth- 
ods, the public schools could not be reconstructed; once 
the public was convinced, and by reason thereof better 
able to stand the increased cost, the schools would natu- 
rally and inevitably readjust themselves. 
It was therefore deliberately decided to undertake the 
agricultural education not of the future farmer, but of the 
present farmer, on the theory that, if he could be sub- 
stantially helped, he would gladly support better schools 
in more and more liberal fashion. The Board, therefore, 
set about an extensive inquiry as to the best means of 
conveying to the average working farmer of the South, in 
his manhood, the most efficient known methods of intelli- 
gent farming. 
ORIGIN OF THE FARM DEMONSTRATION 
The extension of the so-called Codperative Farm 
Demonstration movement resulted from this investiga-
-P-A-G-E-38
  
 
-P-A-G-E-39
FARM DEMONSTRATIONS 23 
tion, The story of its inception and expansion is not 
without strong human interest. In the first place, the 
Secretary of the Board spent almost a year under its 
authorization in seeking to discover the most effective 
methods of teaching improved agricultural methods 
to adult farmers. Agricultural schools in various parts 
of the United States and Canada were studied: the 
MacDonald College at St. Anne, Quebec; the Agricultural 
College of Ontario at Guelph; the agricultural colleges 
of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Texas. By a fortunate coin- 
cidence Dr. Seaman A. Knapp chanced at this time to be 
lecturing on the farm demonstration method at the last- 
named institution. 
The Mexican cotton boll weevil was just beginning its 
devastations. As the pest spread, a panic had taken 
place in Texas. Cotton was the principal crop, and the 
days of its profitable cultivation seemed to be numbered. 
Farms were abandoned and counties well-nigh depopu- 
lated. Acting for the United States Department of 
Agriculture, Dr. Knapp in 1903 established a community 
demonstration farm at Terrell, Texas, for the purpose of 
showing farmers how cotton could be raised despite the 
boll weevil, with such success, indeed, that, from one 
point of view, the boll-weevil curse proved a sort of bless- 
ing in disguise. By means of the improved methods 
employed by Dr. Knapp, the production of cotton was 
actually increased and normal business conditions were 
accordingly restored. If the demonstration method paid 
in dealing with a pest-ridden farm, was there not every
-P-A-G-E-40
24 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
reason to suppose that it would pay still more hand- 
somely where no handicap at all existed? In Dr. Knapp’s 
farm demonstration work, limited at that time to com- 
bating the boll weevil, the General Education Board 
found the answer to its search for a method of delivering 
the existing knowledge of effective agricultural processes 
to present farmers. 
Shortly afterward, the executive officers of the General 
Education Board—the Chairman and the Secretary— 
met Dr. Knapp in Washington in a series of conferences. 
Dr. Knapp’s varied agricultural activities and experience 
were thoroughly discussed—particularly the history and 
outcome of his efforts in farm demonstration. The 
feasibility of extending the method as an educational 
Measure was considered—the cost of such extension, 
the probability of its ultimately supporting itself, the 
length of time which must probably elapse before any 
such result could be counted on. It was agreed that the 
work would permanently affect Southern agricultural 
prosperity only if it became vitally rooted; that, there- 
fore, an outside agency engaged in its promotion must 
regard its part as temporary and experimental. Dr. 
Knapp was from the outset confident that experience 
would justify this view. He believed that if the 
demonstration work could once be started by outside 
funds in a state, a county, or a community, it would 
promptly enlist local support; that it would spread 
from community to community and from state to state; 
and that in the end the teaching of agriculture and

domestic arts would become an accepted feature of rural 
education. 
The program above sketched could not, however, be 
carried out by the Federal Government, because, at that 
time, it was held that government funds could be spent 
only for interstate purposes. Following the success 
of the experimental demonstration at Terrell, Texas, 
Congress had made special appropriations for the purpose 
of combating the boll weevil, and cotton culture farms 
were established by Dr. Knapp throughout the infested 
region; but, as the appropriation was based on the theory 
that the weevil was an interstate menace and, only as 
such, a legitimate object of Federal concern, the money 
was not available for strictly educational uses. The 
coéperation of the General Education Board made the 
educational application of the idea possible. While 
still retaining his connection with the Department of 
Agriculture, Dr. Knapp readily accepted an offer made 
by the Board to finance the educational extension of 
farm demonstrations, entering into the scheme with all 
the vigor and enthusiasm of youth. The United States 
Department of Agriculture became a party to the neces- 
sary arrangements. An agreement, signed April 20, 
1906, by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary 
of the General Education Board, provided that “The 
farmers’ codperative work, in which the General Educa- 
tion Board is to become interested, shall be entirely dis- 
tinct in territory and finance from that carried on solely 
by the Department of Agriculture” and that “the United

States Department of Agriculture shall have supervision 
of the work and shall appoint all special agents for this 
extended territory in the same way that they are now 
appointed, and the said agents shall be under control 
of said department in every respect as fully as any of 
the agents of the department.” Henceforth agricultural 
demonstrations in weevil-infected states were conducted 
with government funds; agricultural demonstrations in 
non-infected states were supported by the General Edu- 
cation Board; control of both being lodged in the Federal 
Department of Agriculture. 
A FARM DEMONSTRATION 
Dr. Knapp’s procedure was the very essence of sim- 
plicity. He knew that through seed selection and inten- 
sive farming the productivity of lands could be immensely 
augmented; in a word, more could be gained through in- 
telligence than was lost through the weevil. In every 
afflicted vicinity Dr. Knapp undertook to propagate his 
methods by actual “demonstration” of their value. 
Selecting a relatively capable farmer in a given neigh- 
borhood, Dr. Knapp induced him to plant and cultivate 
a certain amount of land in a certain way, with a certain 
kind of seed; he relied on the natural imitative instinct 
to induce others to follow when once the result called at- 
tention to the superiority of the process. His bearing 
in the field was characteristic and inimitable. Approach- 
ing the farmer whom he desired to interest, he carried 
on a dialogue somewhat in this fashion:
-P-A-G-E-45
28 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
“T have a cotton seed,’’ he would explain, “which has 
been carefully selected through a long series of years. The 
planting of this seed and its proper cultivation will more 
than double your yield of cotton. We have come to you 
as a leading farmer of this vicinity and would like to have 
you make a demonstration of its value. The demonstra- 
tion, we believe, will not only convince you of the value 
of good seed and of scientific tillage, but will also teach 
your neighbors the same thing.”’ 
Interest once aroused and confidence gained, the neces- 
sary conditions were broached one by one. The land 
must be plowed in the fall. “Why?” Because fall 
plowing gives mellowness to the soil and affords nature 
an opportunity to prepare plant food for the coming sea- 
son. Moreover, the rows of cotton must be planted 
wide apart. “Why?” Because 85 per cent. or more of 
all vegetation is light and air: if the rows are close to- 
gether, the cotton is starved and smothered. Again, the 
cotton must be cultivated six or eight times. “Why?” 
Because there is plenty of moisture down by the roots 
and you can keep it there only by constantly breaking 
up the soil so that it may not be evaporated by the 
heat of the sun. Thus the demonstration was in the 
first instance a simple object lesson. A few shrewd 
aphorisms controlled Dr. Knapp’s procedure: “Don’t 
confuse people by elaborate programs; the average man, 
like the crow, cannot count more than three.’’ And 
again: “Dothenext thing.” He formulated and widely 
circulated

BY-PRODUCTS 
In his talks with farmers, bankers, and business men— 
for, though keeping headquarters in the Department of 
Agriculture at Washington, he travelled almost inces- 
santly—Dr. Knapp endeavored to teach his hearers not 
only how to raise cotton and corn, but how to conduct 
farming as a business—how to ascertain the cost of a 
crop, how to find out whether they were making or losing 
money. “Agriculture,” he was accustomed to declare,
-P-A-G-E-48
30 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
“may be divided into eight parts: one eighth is science; 
three eighths is art; four eighths, business management.” 
He never failed to expose the economic fallacy of the 
factoring system,' and urged that the farmer should raise 
what he needed for his family and his stock, rather than 
buy at the village store, in exchange for his one crop. 
There was, of course, no inherent reason for the restriction 
of the demonstration method to the production of cotton. 
As rapidly as possible, its scope was broadened for the 
purpose of making the farmer more and more indepen- 
dent. He was stimulated to raise stock, to produce 
feed and forage for his stock, and to interest himself in 
truck gardening, hog-raising, etc. A group of Missis- 
sippi farmers is remembered who had been taught by 
Dr. Knapp’s representative not only how to grow cotton, 
but how to grow corn, potatoes, and small fruits, and how 
to keep accounts. ‘‘How many of you made your living 
last year?” was asked. Every one replied affirmatively. 
“How many two years ago?” Not one. For the first 
time in their lives they had balances in the bank and were 
measurably independent of the storekeeper. As a result 
of Dr. Knapp’s teaching there is good prospect that the 
South, which has long sold cotton and with the proceeds 
bought food-stuffs, will grow the latter as well as the 
former. 
As is invariably the case with a fertile idea, the by- 
products of the demonstration movement are thus hardly

inferior in significance to that of the original idea itself. 
An agricultural demonstration is essentially a codper- 
ative undertaking, the financial contributors, the agent, 
the farmer, the community, all participating. But par- 
ticipation, once started, is not likely to stop. Asa next 
step the demonstration agent naturally assembles in 
“field meetings” all neighborhood farmers engaged or 
interested in demonstration work; a certain degree of 
solidarity is created; bulletins, circulars, pamphlets are 
received and exchanged; communications are established 
between the farmer and the State Agricultural College or 
the Federal Department of Agriculture. Various begin- 
nings are thus made in the direction of associated enter- 
prise. CHARACTERISTIC EXAMPLES 
Dr. Knapp’s reports and correspondence abound in 
picturesque and dramatic illustrations of the foregoing. 
“Tt is important,” he says in one place, ‘‘to confine the 
work to standard crops and the instruction to basic 
methods and principles until every farmer knows the 
methods that make for success, instead of charging failure 
to the moon, to the season, to the soil, or to bad luck.” 
He frequently depicts the psychological transformation 
that the demonstration method has produced. ‘Every 
step is a revelation and surprise. The farmer sees his 
name in the county paper as one of the farmers selected 
by the United States Department of Agriculture to con- 
duct demonstration work;. he receives instructions from 
Washington; he begins to be noticed by his fellows; he

is proud of planting the best seed and doing the best 
cultivation. When the demonstration agent calls a 
field meeting at his farm, he begins to feel that he isa man 
of more consequence than he had thought. Immediately 
the brush begins to disappear from fence corners and the 
weeds from the fields, the yard fence is straightened, 
whitewash or paint goes on the buildings, the team looks 
better, and thedilapidatedharnessisrenovated. Theman 
made a good crop, but the man grew faster than the crop.” 
Characteristic examples may be cited in abundance. 
East of Brookhaven, Mississippi, lived a wretched farmer 
on poor, piney woodland that “‘five years ago (this was 
written in 1910) sold for $1.00 anacre.” He was $800in 
debt to the village storekeepers; very rarely had he made 
corn and hay enough to last beyond March 1st; he did 
not believe that his land was ‘“‘corn-land.” He took no 
papers and read no bulletins. 
Demonstration work began in his county in 1908; but 
our friend, sceptical and depressed, held aloof at first. 
Induced at length to participate, he applied demonstra- 
tion methods to five eighths of an acre in cotton, from 
which, to his amazement, he gathered 500 pounds of lint 
cotton. His respect for the “government method,” 
as it was called, increased. In 1909 his entire farm be- 
came a demonstration. Despite bad seasonal condi- 
tions, he averaged over 1,100 pounds of lint cotton per 
acre, against his neighbor’s average of 300-400 pounds. 
He made, besides, 500 bushels of corn, and from one 
special demonstration acre realized 152 barrels of high-

UNDER THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD THE WORK IS 
EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH 
The codperation of the General Education Board 
brought about an immediate and rapid expansion of the 
demonstration movement in every direction; it conquered 
new territory, dealt with a rapidly increasing number of 
activities, and touched more people. In 1907 only 
Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas were worked by the 
national government; the appropriation of the General 
Education Board extended the work to Mississippi, 
Alabama, and Virginia; in 1908 the government made 
additional provision for Oklahoma; the General Educa- 
tion Board for Georgia and the two Carolinas. The next 
year the government took over Mississippi; the Board 
made provision for Florida. Government funds were 
next employed in Tennessee; the Board’s in West Vir- 
ginia and Maryland. At the close of the year 1913 the 
entire region covered by the farm demonstration move- 
ment was, in so far as the source of financial support is 
concerned, divided as follows:

FARM DEMONSTRATIONS 37 
The number of counties reached and the number of 
farms reached in each county increased with great rapid- 
ity. Eleven counties in North Carolina were dealt with 
in 1908; fifty-six in 1912; twenty-three in Alabama in the 
former year; every one of the sixty-seven in the state 
four years later. At the close of 1912, out of 1,163 
counties in all the Southern states, farm demonstration 
work was in progress in 636, ranging from 100 in Texas to 
5in Maryland. In Alabama, every county was reached; 
in South Carolina, 95.4 per cent. of the counties; in 
Mississippi, 81 per cent.; in Arkansas, 77 per cent.; in 
Louisiana, 70 per cent.; Oklahoma, 55 per cent.; Florida, 
54 per cent.; North Carolina and Virginia, 52 per cent.; 
Texas, 40 per cent.; Tennessee, 27 per cent.; Maryland, 
21 per cent. Work has recently been started in six 
counties in Maine and in five in New Hampshire. In 
the New England States, however, the work is managed, 
not through the United States Department of Agricul- 
ture, but through the state colleges of agriculture. 
The expansion of the work is, however, most plainly 
reflected in the number of farms and farmers affected. 
In 1906, 545 farms were reached; a year later, 2,834; 
in 1908, something over 14,000; in 1910, 63,622; in 1912, 
106,621. Twenty-five thousand adults were at the last- 
named date receiving instruction in Texas; over 15,000 
in Oklahoma; over 15,000 in Arkansas; 10,500 in Ala- 
bama; 6,190 in Mississippi. Demonstration farms are 
now too thickly studded to show on a map of small 
scale; but the accompanying maps (4, 5, and 6) are inter-

esting as indicating the rapid growth in number of farms 
and the contagious nature of the movement. The dem- 
onstration farm is naturally an object of local curiosity. 
By actual count it has been ascertained that from thirty 
to one hundred farmers annually visit each demon- 
stration. On the basis of the lower average 360,000 
persons saw the 12,000 demonstration farms cultivated 
in 1908. 
WORK DIRECTED BY GOVERNMENT 
Attention has been called to the line of demarcation 
between the states in which government money and those 
in which the contributions of the General Education 
Board were expended. The constitutional scruple which 
suggested itself in reference to Federal support of purely 
educational work within the several states was thus 
continuously respected. The organization and admin- 
istration of the entire work were nevertheless completely 
unified in the Bureau of Plant Industry of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture at Washington. The several states 
had as such no way of knowing whether the demonstra- 
tion work within their respective confines was supported. 
by one party to the agreement or the other; all funds were 
disbursed by the Department of Agriculture; all appoint- 
ments were made by the Department of Agriculture; all 
reports were made to the Department of Agriculture; in 
the Department of Agriculture complete administrative 
control was vested. From time to time the Secretary 
of the General Education Board conferred with the offi-

cers of the Department in reference to the extension of 
the work to other states, its enlargement by new features, 
which will be shortly described, and similar matters, and 
duplicate copies of various reports were sent to the Board. 
But the General Education Board had no authority. 
Its sole desire was to facilitate the progress of the move- — 
ment by supplying funds which, whatever the reason, 
neither the general government, nor the several states, 
nor other organizations or individuals, offered to furnish; 
and its ultimate object on account of which the work 
was originally undertaken remained, viz., the increase 
of the taxable wealth of the South in order—to quote 
Dr. Knapp’s pregnant words—that “schools should 
follow as the sequence of greater earning capacity and 
should not be planted by charity to become a tax 
on poverty.” 
ORGANIZATION OF THE WORK 
The conduct of the work was placed in the hands of a 
special agent, reporting directly to the Chief of the Bu- 
reau of Plant Industry, and assisted by a corps of field 
agents—classified, according to the territory assigned to 
them, as state, district, and county agents. These agents 
are selected on the basis of special fitness and experience 
and are governed by instructions emanating from Wash- 
ington. The size of the force grew with the extent of the 
work; it numbered only twenty-four, all told, in 1906,

State Agricultural Colleges, as has been previously stated.

twenty of whom were supported by the government, 
four by the General Education Board; thirty-six the 
next year, twenty-one on the government pay-roll, fifteen 
on that of the General Education Board; one hundred and 
fifty-six in 1908, seventy-one paid by the government, 
eighty-five by the General Education Board. By 1912 
there was a roster of 639 agents, not counting 155 agents 
assigned to the girls’ and boys’ clubs which were, as we 
shall see, an important outgrowth of the demonstration 
movement. 
ENLARGEMENT DOES NOT AFFECT METHOD 
Too often extension involves mechanization and con- 
sequent sterilization of educational method; with an in- 
crease of numbers, either inferior persons are employed, 
or verbal explanation addressed to masses supplants con- 
crete experiment or demonstration. In the present 
instance no such deterioration has taken place. The in- 
struction has remained concrete and individual; and the 
development on the social side has served only to in- 
augurate additional concrete and individual experiments. 
Four general field agents now keep the central authority 
in close touch with the work; they are on the lookout for 
local difficulties; in addition, they appoint times and 
places for bringing together state and local agents for 
conference and instruction. Thus the main principles 
of the work are constantly kept prominently before those 
on whom, in the end, success depends. Each state is 
supervised by its own state agent, assisted by district
-P-A-G-E-67
46 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
agents in charge of from fifteen to twenty-five localagents, 
The state and district agents make frequent excursions 
with the local representative, examining into the loca- 
tion of farms, assure themselves as to the quality of the 
local supervision, and communicate observations made in 
other sections of their territory. The local agent is 
absolutely responsible for the number and success of the 
experiments under way in his field; for the amount of 
enthusiasm generated; for the extent and variety of other 
activities, social and individual, following in its wake. 
The tests applied are throughout actual, and as long as 
this is the case extension involves no perils to the spirit 
and outcome of the movement. 
APPROPRIATIONS: GOVERNMENT, GENERAL EDUCATION 
BOARD, AND OTHER SOURCES 
The initial appropriation of the General Education 
Board in 1905 was $7,000. At that time the government 
was devoting $40,000 to demonstrations directed against 
the boll weevil. The Board appropriated $30,900 the 
next year, $76,500 two years later, $130,000 in 1911, and 
$252,000 in 1913. These sums were unevenly distrib- 
uted: in 1908-9, $4,000 was spent in Florida, $15,000 in 
Virginia; the next year, $19,000 in Virginia, $30,000 in 
Georgia; in 1911-12, $23,000 in South Carolina, $25,000 
in North Carolina. For the current year the appro- 
priation for Maine was $19,500, for New Hampshire 
$10,000.

By all odds the most important contributions are those 
designated as coming from ‘‘other sources.”” The govern- 
ment had in the first place undertaken to deal with the 
boll weevil; the General Education Board had supported 
a straightout educational application of the farm demon- 
stration; and success had promptly achieved the most 
significant result that outside assistance can ever achieve 
—it had led the Southern people to help themselves 
out of the very first profits of their new insight. In 
less than a decade, ‘‘other sources’’—i. e., the South- 
ern people themselves, were paying almost 50 per cent. 
of a total annual expenditure approaching $1,200,000, 
1 Approximate.
-P-A-G-E-70
FARM DEMONSTRATIONS 49 
thus vindicating the policy on which the Board had 
acted. SELF-HELP 
The tendency to self-help showed itself very early. 
Already in 1909, the Virginia legislature created an 
Agricultural Board with an appropriation of $15,000, 
which was used in actively supporting the demonstra- 
tion work; more than a dozen counties made additional 
appropriations ranging from $300 to $500 apiece. In the 
same year, $5,360 was locally raised in North Carolina; 
$6,000 in South Carolina. The next year the Alabama 
legislature gave $25,000; the Arkansas legislature au- 
thorized coédperation on the part of the counties. In 1912, 
Georgia raised something less than $14,000, contributed 
by the State Agricultural College, various Chambers of 
Commerce, business men, and local committees. Funds 
obtained in this manner represent the conviction, effort, 
and sacrifice of those who are to be benefited—a moral 
as well as material contribution. The initial demonstra- 
tion had to be financed from the outside, had also to be 
temporarily sustained from the outside. But from the 
moment that results appeared, local support was due. 
The preceding account shows how promptly and gener- 
ously it came forth. In the end, the increased resources 
of the South will fully sustain whatever further demon- 
strations may be necessary. The whole incident fur- 
nishes a perfect illustration of the valuable part that can 
be played by private beneficence. Governmental bodies 
can with difficulty undertake educational experimenta-
-P-A-G-E-71
50 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
tion on radically new lines; unofficial organizations are 
more receptive of new suggestions, can create here 
or there the conditions required for an experiment, and, 
as they are unhampered, can command the advice and the 
ability needed to inaugurate and to develop a novelty. 
A successful demonstration once made, the work can 
be turned over to the state, and the funds released may be 
devoted to the solution of other problems, handled ac- 
cording to the same general method of procedure. 
RESULTS 
Roughly speaking, it is fair to say that the demonstra- 
tion method doubles the crop to which it is applied. In 
1909, the United States Bureau of Statistics calculated 
that the average yield in pounds of seed cotton was 
503.6 per acre; on demonstration farms taken by them- 
selves the average was 906.1 pounds; in 1910, the figures 
were 512.1 and 858.9 respectively; in 1911, 624.6 and 
1081.8; in 1912, 579.6 and 1054.8. 
Corn makes a similar showing. The Bureau of Sta- 
tistics reports an average of 16.7 bushels per acre in r909 
for states in which demonstrations were in progress; on 
these demonstration farms, however, the average was 
31.7 bushels per acre; subsequent years were as follows:

FARM DEMONSTRATIONS 5I 
No matter how the figures are studied, the same equally 
favorable results emerge. In Mississippi, for example— 
to take a single state—an acre of land yielded in 1907 
on the average 17 bushels of corn, or 228 pounds of lint 
cotton; a demonstration acre yielded, however, 35 bush- 
els of corn or 445 pounds of lint cotton. In Alabama, in 
the same year, average acres yielded 15.5 bushels of corn, 
169 pounds of cotton; demonstration acres, 37.6 bushels 
of corn, 428 pounds of cotton. 
The poorer the season, the more clearly the demon- 
stration method proves its superiority. The year 1911 
was a poor one for crop raising in the South. Drought 
was severe and prolonged. In Texas and Oklahoma it 
was indeed the culmination of a dry period covering three 
successive seasons. Thousands of acres planted in corn 
produced nothing at all. Oklahoma, taken as a whole, 
averaged in consequence only 6.5 bushels of corn to the 
acre, Texas only 9. Yet the demonstration farms aver- 
aged 13 bushels per acre in Oklahoma, and over 22 in 
Texas. Under the unfavorable boll-weevil conditions in 
Louisiana, 33,022 demonstration acres averaged 1063.5 
pounds of seed cotton as against an average of 522 pounds 
per acre for the entire state. 
The work can also be viewed from the standpoint of 
the farmer’s financial profit. In Alabama, for example, 
in 1912, the average yield of lint cotton was 173 pounds 
per acre; but demonstration acres averaged 428.3 pounds. 
Demonstration methods, therefore, netted the farmer 
255-3 pounds per acre. At the average price of $65 a
-P-A-G-E-74
52 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
bale for lint and seed, the farmer made an extra $33 per 
acre; as there were 8,221 acres under cultivation on the 
demonstration method, the total gain was $271,000. In 
the same year, 7,402 acres were under cultivation in 
demonstration corn. Demonstration acres averaged 
26.9 bushels more per acre than the general average for 
the state. The demonstration farmers of the state 
pocketed $139,379.66 in consequence. 
DIVERSIFICATION OF CROPS 
Though corn and cotton have been most frequently 
instanced in this account, local conditions have been 
everywhere considered, and efforts to diversify production 
have been increasing. In Virginia, for instance, it was 
soon perceived that south of the James River the former 
tobacco lands, covered with sedge grass and pine brush, 
had been largely impoverished. The tobacco area had 
been gradually reduced. After studying the situation, it 
was decided to try the substitution of hay and corn for 
the tobacco crop, with the ultimate purpose of developing 
a dairy and stock country. Six years later, the general 
agent could report that in counties where demonstra- 
tions were in progress 15,000 acres were seeded to mixed 
grasses; that interest in grass culture was rapidly growing, 
and that 2,000 acres had been seeded in demonstration 
alfalfa during the past year. Similar phenomena could 
be cited from every other state. In South Carolina, for 
example, vetch, oats, rye, crimson clover, cowpeas, and 
hay are now raised on demonstration farms. The farm-

ers of the state had previously been prejudiced against 
the cultivation of grasses. A regular campaign of educa- 
tion was undertaken. Two special demonstrators were 
enlisted; the seeding was done in late September, 1911; 
the hay cut and cured in the spring and summer of 1912. 
There were but two failures as contrasted with many pro- 
nounced successes. At a total cost of $41.20, one farmer 
near Lowndesville produced 12,300 pounds of hay worth 
approximately $125. In Maine, demonstrations were 
made in market gardening, orcharding, and potato grow- 
ing, as well as in general farming; in New Hampshire, 
orcharding and dairying have been particularly empha- 
sized. Meanwhile, whatever the crop, the demonstration 
agent is everywhere the evangelist of better things: ‘Our 
work is not limited to better cultural methods and to 
securing better crops,’ writes Dr. Knapp. “Every 
agent is instructed to insist upon a general clearing up of 
the farm and an improvement in all farm equipment, 
especially comfortable houses, better barns, stronger 
teams, better implements, removal of brush patches, and 
the establishment of good pastures.’’ 
Hence the beneficent results of the farm demonstra- 
tion work are not limited to financial profit and cannot 
be entirely measured in money. The. disorganization 
characteristic of rural life and of the agencies concerned 
with it tends to disappear before the types of codperation 
and intercourse that the demonstration movement has 
initiated. Colleges of agriculture, farmers’ institutes, 
and agricultural high schools have been brought into
-P-A-G-E-77
54 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
increasingly intimate relation. These contacts are trans- 
lating themselves into social and educational terms. 
Indeed the social and educational awakening of the rural 
South is to some extent at least a by-product of the 
coéperative demonstration movement. 
DEMONSTRATION AMONG NEGRO FARMERS 
The Negro farmer has been quick to take advantage 
of such opportunities in demonstration work as have 
been offered to him. In his very first report Dr. Knapp 
writes: ‘As the bulk of the cotton crop is produced by 
colored laborers and tenants, all our agents are not only 
instructed but of their own choice select colored farmers 
as demonstrators, visiting them regularly and giving 
them every attention.’”’ In some states, colored local 
agents work under the white state agent. At Mound 
Bayou, in the delta region of Mississippi, under a colored 
local agent, six demonstrations were started in 1907; 
forty-one were in operation the following year, and the 
sum of $50 was raised by the colored people themselves 
for prizes. In Virginia a somewhat different plan is 
pursued, a district agent, reporting directly to Washing- 
ton, being in charge. Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes, 
and many other industrial and agricultural schools for 
Negroes, have played essential parts in this development. 
Their training has produced agents and teachers, who go 
out into life persuaded that the fate of the race depends 
primarily on improved economic efficiency. Frequently, 
throughout the year, the Negro farmers of the neighbor-

hood or state are brought together to see and to value 
each other’s product. Pride and solidarity are thus built 
up. : 
The precise results due to demonstration efforts among 
Negro farmers are difficult to give, because many colored 
farmers are enrolled under white agents; but the number 
of colored agents is gradually increasing. In 1910 there 
were twenty-three; the next year thirty-two. At the 
latter date, 3,709 Negro farmers were reported by name, 
and it was estimated by the Department that 20,000 
were under instruction. The results were as good as 
those obtained by the whites: in South Carolina, for 
example (where, by the way, 56 per cent. of the farms 
are operated by Negroes without white supervision), there 
were, in 1911, 570 acres of cotton and 449 acres of corn 
under demonstration by Negroes. The average yield 
per acre throughout the state was 795 pounds of seed 
cotton, and 18.2 bushels of corn: the Negro demonstrators 
averaged 1567.9 pounds of seed cotton, and 38.1 bushels 
of corn. The gain in money at current prices ap- 
proximated $24,000. 
Among Negroes, as among whites, the work tends to 
expand in scope. Demonstrators are instructed to pro- 
cure information regarding the rural economy of the 
Negro farmers: how many plow in the fall, have summer 
and winter gardens, keep a cow, care for poultry, have 
pigs, etc. At Snow Hill, Alabama, the Negro demonstra- 
tors have formed a club and agreed on “‘a standard,” 
requiring every member to possess an enclosed garden,
-P-A-G-E-80
56 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
‘in which something must be kept growing the year 
round; to keep at least one hog for each member of his 
family, not less than thirty hens, and one or two cows; to 
preserve or can fruits sufficient for the family’s demand; 
to plant shrubs, and whitewash the house, and to take at 
least one agricultural paper.” Local agents report 
many instances of improved farm equipment due to 
demonstration work: home gardens, wire fences, new 
mules, harvesters, riding cultivators, grain drills, en- 
larged houses, cleaned premises, and the liberal use of 
whitewash. The farm demonstrator and the farm dem- 
onstration arouse pride and stimulate energy. The net 
outcome has never been more picturesquely summed 
up than bya Negro farmer in Virginia: “You done turned 
de kivers down and waked us up.” 
The account above given must not, however, convey 
the idea that farm demonstrations now cover the field. 
This is not the case; the work is far from adequate to 
the need and the demand. Five hundred Southern 
counties had not been reached at all at the end of 1912; 
needless to say that perhaps no single county has been 
exhaustively worked and many have been barely touched. 
There is also every reason to believe that the demon- 
stration method has significance for North, East, and 
West—not for the South alone. At best a substantial 
experiment has been successfully performed; it remains 
to make a general application of the method. Fortu- 
nately the value of demonstration has been so clear that 
the Federal Government will now take over and extend

purely educational farm demonstrations; success has 
dissipated the constitutional scruple that for the past 
ten years has restricted governmental activities in this 
direction to plague-infested states. Needless to remark, 
however, the final result will be disappointing unless the 
movement is dominated by the spirit which was infused 
into it by its founder; unless the same standards of 
fitness continue to prevail in the selection of the ever- 
increasing army of employees who will be required 
for its extension, and the same constant regard for con- 
crete results remains the test applied to the outcome. 
On the other hand, the progress of the movement has 
itself created new problems; for the transportation and 
marketing facilities of the South are already inadequate 
to advantageous disposition of increased and diversified 
products. Thus in a living and developing society the 
solution of one difficulty invariably involves the creation 
of others. Meanwhile, Dr. Knapp’s vision is fairly on 
the way to realization. ‘‘It will take time to transform 
the methods of the average farmer,” he wrote at the 
outset, ‘‘but if our plans are persistently followed, the 
beneficent results are as sure as the light from to-morrow’s 
sun.” ; BOYS’ CORN CLUBS 
The farm demonstration work was designed to reach 
adult farmers. Obviously, the need for instruction of 
this type would, in the long run, disappear if, so to speak, 
the farmer were caught younger. The boys’ corn club 
was designed to accomplish this end. Sporadic clubs
-P-A-G-E-83
58 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
had already been organized by a few county superin- 
tendents of education, when in 1908 Dr. Knapp appro- 
priated and made the most of the idea. As far as 
possible, every boy should plant an acre of corn on his 
father’s farm; in every neighborhood there should be a 
local boys’ corn club; next, county and state organizations; 
finally, a federation of corn clubs, including every South- 
ern state. Local, county, and state prizes should be 
awarded; the topmost boys should be sent to Washington, 
to meet the Secretary of Agriculture and to shake hands 
with the President. The expanded idea was an effort 
to appeal to the boy’s imagination—assuredly an effective 
way of dignifying the farming occupation. But the 
shrewd old teacher knew that merely decorative distinc- 
tions would in the long run prove ineffective. The boy, 
therefore, was to sell his crop and pocket the money! 
A club consists essentially of a group of boys varying 
in number from twenty-five to one hundred, and ranging 
in age from ten to eighteen. Corn and cotton are both 
cultivated, but corn is preferred: first, because the South 
needs more corn; secondly, because corn lends itself 
better to study and selection. As a rule, each member 
works a plot of one acre. The county superintendent of 
education is usually in charge. Appointed special agent 
of the Department of Agriculture with a nominal salary 
of one dollar a year, he obtains the franking privilege 
which enables him to procure reports from the boys and 
to disseminate information and instruction among them. 
But, more and more, other agencies also undertake to

* codperate, prominent among them being state colleges of 
agriculture, of which nine were regularly connected with 
the work in the year 1912. 
The club enrolment has increased with great rapidity, 
as the following figures testify:

The growth of il Gone is ‘itself the best proof of the 
enthusiasm excited and the substantial material results 
achieved. Nor has its influence been limited to the 
boys; for the crops raised have set new standards and 
opened new vistas for the adult farmer. In 1o10, for 
example, the boys’ clubs of Holmes County, Mississippi, 
averaged 76 bushels of corn per acre, while their fathers 
were averaging 16. In the same season, 100 boys in 
various parts of the South averaged 133.7 bushels, and 
one boy produced over 200; the following season, 100 
boys averaged 137.48 bushels, 7 boys raised over 200; in 
1911, 471 made over 100 bushels to the acre; in 1912, 
493. Inthe awarding of prizes for these notable perform- 
ances various factors are taken into consideration and 
credit is given accordingly: 30 per cent. is allowed for 
yield, 30 per cent. for the showing of profit, 20 per cent.

out of the appropriations for farm demonstrations.

for the best ten ears, 20 per cent. for the best written 
report. The standards are thus concrete, but not 
merely quantitative. 
The instances above cited represent, of course, the 
most favorable results; but the general average of the 
boys is, as the following figures show, strikingly superior 
to results otherwise obtained:

The corn club, like the farm demonstration, is, how- 
ever, at best as yet only a successful experiment; it 
remains to be extended and developed. There can 
be little doubt that, if wisely handled, this movement 
among farm boys of school age will be the means of en- 
riching the rural school by associating it closely with the 
natural interests and environment of its pupils. The 
boys are “learning by doing.” Instead of studying text-

books on agriculture, instead of simply listening to ex- 
planation and exhortation, they are performing practical 
agricultural tasks—tasks which form the basis of school 
work on the subject. Meanwhile, the mere pecuniary 
outcome is far from negligible. The following incident 
is typical: 
Driving through Macon County, Alabama, not long 
ago, two strangers observed, in a large field of ordinary 
corn, a patch standing out like a miniature skyscraper. 
They dismounted to interview the owner. A Negro boy 
approached. 
“Ts this your corn?” 
Yes, sir.” 
“How did you come to grow it?” 
“One of Dr. Knapp’s men showed me, sir.” 
“Why did you plant it so far apart in the rows?” 
“Because, sir, most all that grows comes from the 
sunshine and the air.” 
“When did you plow?” 
“Last fall, sir.” 
“Why?” 
“To make plant food during the winter.” 
“Where did you get your fertilizer?” 
“From the bottom, sir.” 
“How many times did you cultivate?” 
“Six times, sir.” 
“Why?” 
“Because there’s water down next to the clay, and 
when I don’t plow the sun draws it all away.”
-P-A-G-E-89
62 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
“When did you put in the cowpeas?” 
“After the last plowing, sir.”’ 
“What did you do that for?” 
“Because the cowpeas get out of the air nitrogen, and 
put back in the ground about as much as the corn takes 
out.” : 
How many valuable lessons had this remote Negro lad 
learned from doing one job right! But this is not the 
endofthestory. His double crop was worth$52. From 
his pocket he pulled a dirty little pass-book, the entries 
in which showed what the crop had cost. Reckoning 
his own time at ten cents an hour and his father’s mule 
at a dollar a day, he netted a profit of $30 to the acre. 
His younger sister, it appeared, had had an equally 
profitable quarter of an acre in cotton. Three years 
later both were students at Tuskegee, paying for their 
education with the money earned as club workers. 
GIRLS’ CANNING AND POULTRY CLUBS 
Father and son were reached by the methods above 
described; mother and daughter remained to be dealt 
with. “The demonstration work,” wrote Dr. Knapp in 
his report under date October, 1910, “‘has proven that it 
is possible to reform by simple means the economic life 
and the personality of the farmer on his farm. The 
Boys’ Corn Clubs have likewise shown how to turn the 
attention of the boy toward the farm. There remains 
the home itseli—and its women and girls. This problem 
cannot be approached directly. The reformer who tells

the farmer and his wife that their entire home system is 
wrong will meet with failure. With these facts in view, 
I have begun a work among girls to teach one simple and 
straightforward lesson which will open their eyes to the 
possibilities of adding to the family income through 
simple work in and about the home.” 
Something of the kind had indeed already started near 
Aiken, South Carolina, where Miss Marie Cromer had 
purchased a canning outfit and organized some canning 
clubs among the girls of the vicinity, tomatoes having 
been chosen as the most available garden vegetable. 
Once more Dr. Knapp seized upon an idea, and in vision 
saw it encompassing the entire South. He saw in it a 
means of importing a new interest into the home, of 
bringing about codperation in domestic tasks between 
mother and daughter, of encouraging rural families to 
provide better food at lower cost by utilizing orchard 
and garden products, of providing girls a way of earning 
money, of furnishing teachers a method of helping entire 
communities. 
The method is simple: each girl takes one tenth of an 
acre and is taught how to select the seed, to plant, culti- 
vate, and perfect the growth of the tomato plant. Mean- 
while, portable canning outfits have been provided, to be 
set up out of doors—in the orchard or the garden—and 
trained teachers of domestic science instruct the local 
teachers in the best methods. When the tomatoes are 
ripe, the girls come together, now at one home, now at 
another, to can the product. It is done in the most up-
-P-A-G-E-92
64 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
to-date fashion. The girls are taught the necessity of 
scrupulous cleanliness; they sterilize utensils and cans, 
seal and label, and indeed manufacture an easily market- 
able product. Naturally, other garden produce and 
poultry soon become objects of interest and care. A 
representative exhibit would contain pears and peaches, 
chow-chow and tomato soy, mustard pickles and pickled 
onions, corn on the cob and preserved plums. The girls 
write essays on the “Life History of the Tomato and 
Its Uses,” ‘Gardening and Canning Arithmetic,” 
“The Value of Vegetables in the Daily Diet,” “How 
to Set a Table,” ‘‘How to Cook a Piece of Meat,” 
and so on. They have to draw sketches of their 
plots, to figure out and report on the cost of their crop 
and its market value. A prize is bestowed on the girl 
who gives the greatest number of recipes for the prepa- 
ration of a given vegetable. All sorts of things thus im- 
mediately relate themselves to the job of canning. 
The enrolment duplicates the experience of the boys’ 
clubs. Three hundred and twenty-five girls were registered 
the first year; 3,000 the next; 23,550 in the year following; 
in 1913 there were upward of 30,000 in fourteen differ- 
ent states. This army of workers was under the general 
direction of the special agent in the Department of Agri- 
culture in charge of the Farm Demonstration work, 
acting through the trained women who were the state 
and county agents. Headquarters were attached to 
the state agricultural college, a normal school, or other 
educational institution. Where the appointment of a

special agent was not feasible, the corn club agent 
served. By the close of the season 1912, 134 agents 
were in the field: 15 each in Alabama and North Caro- 
lina, 14 in Mississippi, 12 in South Carolina, and 11 
in Georgia. 
The entire expense of the Girls’ Canning Club work 
has at all times been borne by the General Education 
Board except for local contributions. In 1911, an in- 
itial appropriation of $5,000 was made; $25,000 the fol- 
lowing year; in May, 1913, the appropriation of the 
Board for this purpose was $75,000. Though the na- 
tional government through the Department of Agricul- 
ture has had entire control and supervision, it has borne 
no part of the expense. The states in which the work 
is now going forward on this basis are Maryland, Vir- 
ginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Ten- 
nessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. 
The average profit made by girls reporting in twelve 
states was $21.98; but not a few made sums far in excess. 
A Lincoln County, Mississippi, girl realized a net profit 
just under $100 on her 950 cans of tomatoes; a neighbor 
made 1,008 cans with a profit to herself of $77.73; a girl 
living in Aiken County, South Carolina, netted $60.51. 
Nor are these figures rough guesses. The accounts are, 
in these instances, carefully kept. They reckon rent, 
cost of preparing and cultivating the soil, fertilizer, cans, 
labels, labor, vegetables sold, vegetables used fresh for 
home consumption, etc.
-P-A-G-E-95
66 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
The imponderable indirect gains are certainly not 
less important. Canning club day is a social occasion. 
Mother prepares something a little extra for luncheon, 
and asks the aid and instruction of the teacher in charge 
of the Canning Club. The home is “‘tidied up,” tables 
are properly set out and decorated, bouquets of wild 
flowers appear here and there about the rooms. The 
boys come; mothers and fathers come; the neighborhood 
is there! Thus social interest is kindled about the doing 
of something worth while. There follows a spirit of 
mutual helpfulness, mutual concern, mutual affection. 
This sort of thing lays the foundation for codperation 
in larger and more important things—in the church, in 
the school, in charities, in business. With the sharpened 
vision of a man nearing his end, Dr. Knapp saw all this. 
His last visit to the offices of the General Education 
Board was for the purpose of arranging the expansion 
of the girls’ club work. He was already stricken with 
illness, but he was not too feeble to foretell what might 
be accomplished through this work for Southern woman- 
hood. This was indeed his last legacy. 
EDUCATIONAL INTERPRETATION OF THE DEMONSTRATION 
MOVEMENT 
The facts above stated are not to be regarded as 
indicating an accomplished transformation. No such 
transformation has been achieved. The data merely

est and activity, which, if multiplied indefinitely, seem

destined to bring about far-reaching material and social 
changes. In a broad sense of the term this is assuredly 
educational work of the most valuable kind. But, on 
closer scrutiny, it will appear that demonstration work is 
educational even in the narrower technical sense, and, as 
such, in line with the entire modern educational move- 
ment. 
The work was not begun in pursuance of any educa- 
tional theory. It embodied the reaction of a fresh mind 
applied to a specific concrete situation. In the first in- 
stance, an effort was made to deal with an unsatisfactory 
agricultural situation by improving the farmer himself. 
This was, in effect, to create a trade continuation school 
for agriculturists. The demonstration movement em- 
bodied, perhaps more or less unconsciously, the idea that 
a man is a single organic thing; that his education and 
environment are vitally related to each other; that this 
relation does not arbitrarily stop until he stops, as dead, 
or utterly unprogressive; that all his life a really live 
man ought to be gaining from his environment and re- 
acting favorably on his environment; that out of this 
shuttlecock movement come increasing economic security, 
widening of horizon, and spiritual awakening. The trade 
continuation school is valuable because it favors this sort 
of growth for the urban artisan; the farm demonstration 
work has achieved precisely the same thing for the agri- 
culturist. Neither Dr. Knapp nor those in the General 
Education Board who supported him foresaw all this; but 
the passing of a decade makes it plain to those who survey
-P-A-G-E-98
68 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD © 
the field in the effort to ascertain and comprehend what 
has happened. 
The boys’ corn clubs and the girls’ canning clubs may 
be similarly interpreted. They were, as has been stated 
above, extremely unpretentious outgrowths of the demon- 
stration idea. What more natural than that, after the 
father has been assisted to make more cotton and more 
corn and better cotton and better corn, the boy should 
be caught earlier, and the girl taught the domestic sides 
of improved agricultural processes? The authors of the 
scheme had no further educational philosophy as its 
sanction. Indeed, the educational philosopher must, 
like other philosophers, come after the event. The step 
was taken to meet a situation; and, like all sound steps 
similarly taken, it developed unsuspected significance. 
The Southern club movements may contain the germ 
of the solution of the vocational problem in the rural 
districts. They take up relevant, vital, fundamental 
activities and make them part of the normal process 
of growth. The activities involved are useful; they are 
productive; they make for intelligent living in the child’s 
environment; they increase his economic competency; 
they do not tie him to the soil, if any sufficient reason 
exists for his leaving it; they make him more contented 
and more efficient, however, if he stays there. They fit 
in with the more intellectual work in the schoolroom 
without overburdening the school by making it the sole 
custodian of the growing child, the sole sponsor for 
everything he gets—a tendency all too plainly evident in

urban education; finally, the clubs develop the capacity 
for united action and may thus prove the beginning of 
more effective coéperation in our future rural life. A 
serious problem would be solved if some form of voca- 
tional training could be found for the city boy that 
is equally simple, general, concrete, useful, profitable, 
broadening, and allied with other equally valuable con- 
crete and social activities. 
There is, however, still another aspect to be pondered. 
Too often the school devitalizes material in order to 
adapt it to what are supposed to be schoolroom require- 
ments. Not only literature and history, but concrete 
things like physics and chemistry, are thus at times 
systematized to death. Manual training, though of un- 
doubted educational value as sense and muscle training, 
has fallen short of the hopes based upon it, to the extent 
that it has been formalized. Industrial and vocational 
training is clearly open to the same danger; for the more 
or less mechanized imitation of industrial and vocational 
processes, apart from the exigencies and stimuli of real 
conditions, may prove to be only another kind of manual 
training. It is fortunate, indeed, that the rural situ- 
ation is so far simple that it can be handled on the 
vocational side, without transferring everything to the 
school; indeed, without subjecting the vocational sub- 
ject matter to the processes of refinement and abstraction 
that are all too apt to result in sterilization. The 
Southern club work has wholly escaped this fate, because 
it has been carried on in normal ways in its natural
-P-A-G-E-101

habitat, and becauseits outcome has been subjected to the 
real tests of the market. The boys have cultivated a real 
acre apiece on the farm; the girls have cultivated a real 
tenth of an acre in the family garden. The boys have 
measured their corn in current bushels and sold it at 
market price; the girls have had to comply with the pure 
food law. The cash return has been larger or smaller, 
according to the quality and quantity of the result, 
The conditions have been precisely those prescribed by 
the task itself; the incentives have been precisely those 
that operate upon mature men and women, and the 
reality of both process and result grips the growing boy 
and girl. For this reason the club work is likely to bea 
determining influence in life; the activity is actual, the 
standards are actual, and the results—economic and 
moral—genuine.

IV. SECONDARY EDUCATION 
sions: the graded or elementary school, the high 
school, and the college or university. During 
the first two decades succeeding the war, provision was 
made by law in all the Southern states for the organ- 
ization of public elementary school systems. In a sub- 
sequent section of this report? the state of elementary 
education in the South will be somewhat fully discussed. 
Suffice it at this point to say that elementary school 
systems existed in skeleton at least, and that in the cities 
especially these skeletons were in process of being endued 
with flesh and blood. Every state also possessed its State 
University, usually of antebellum origin, while privately 
supported colleges were then, as now, superabundant. 
Under this plan of organization the high school is of 
strategic importance. Without it, the elementary pupil 
lacks a powerful incentive to continue his schooling. 
Moreover, without adequate facilities in the form of 
secondary education, a competent body of elementary 
school teachers cannot be obtained in sufficient numbers; 
the elementary teachers could have only such education 
as is furnished by elementary schools, supplemented, per- A MERICAN education is organized in three divi-

We] THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
haps, by a small amount of normal school training or a 
brief period in a “college”? or academy. The proper 
development of elementary education is thus necessarily 
dependent on the vigor of the high school. 
The college or university is equally dependent. It is 
not a question as to whether college standards are high 
or low; from the standpoint of educational organization 
this is not the main consideration. An effective college 
can be developed from any one of several starting-points, 
a two-year, a three-year, or a four-year high school. 
Essential only are the precision of the point of depart- 
ure and close articulation between the two types of in- 
stitution. A sound system of higher education presup- 
poses the existence of high schools with adequate courses 
of study taught during a definite series of years by com- 
petent instructors. Without such facilities at the sec- 
ondary school level the college must be formless and 
relatively ineffective. Thus, higher education, as well as 
elementary education, is peculiarly dependent on the 
high school. 
SOUTHERN HIGH SCHOOLS 
The educational surveys, to which repeated reference 
has already been made, dealt, therefore, fully with high 
school conditions in the several Southern states. A 
chaotic situation was disclosed. High schools had in- 
deed been enumerated in reports issued by State De- 
partments of Education and by the Bureau of Education 
in Washington. But these statistics were found to be
-P-A-G-E-104
SECONDARY EDUCATION 73 
entitled to little credence. Though real high schools had 
been established in a number of cities, in general, even 
under the most favorable circumstances, a so-called high 
school was merely the addition of two or occasionally three 
grades, with as many rooms and teachers, to an elemen- 
tary school. Even so, nine years ago, only some thirty 
or forty schools in Virginia could claim to offer two or 
three extra grades doing high school work; and in North 
Carolina, only thirty-five schools set up a similar claim. 
For the most part the “high school” reported in the 
statistics was shadowy and confused in the extreme. 
It had no separate rooms or instructors, no organized 
curriculum, no regularly organized classes, no differenti- 
ation of subject matter according to the qualifications 
of the teachers. Indeed, the subject matter was limited 
to what could be taught from textbooks to individuals 
or small groups; laboratory or other equipment, there 
was, generally speaking, none. In Alabama, to illustrate, 
409 schools were reported in 1902 as teaching high school 
branches, but no information was obtainable as to what 
the branches were. There were, for the most part, no 
definite higher grades. At most, the figures mean that 
some pupils were studying under highly inauspicious 
conditions certain subjects not regularly included in the 
elementary course. Five years later a more critical 
estimate reduced the number of schools “attempting 
high school work” to something like a hundred, of which 
sixty-one were rated as “‘auxiliary schools of the State 
University.” But even of these “the majority can
-P-A-G-E-105
74 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
scarcely be dignified with the title of high school, so 
limited both in time and content are their ‘courses of 
study.’”? Outside of a small number of modest second- 
ary schools in large towns, the Alabama high school was 
thus at this period nothing but a more or less uncertain 
addition to a primary curriculum. 
Similar conditions existed in other states. Of the 
high schools of South Carolina, for instance, it was said 
less than a decade ago that ‘‘few offer a course of study 
of sufficient length; fewer than one fourth offer more 
than one course of study; in most, the teaching force is 
inadequate; and a few are entitled to be called high 
schools only by courtesy.” 
PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
The lack of public high schools was temporarily, and 
for the most part very poorly, compensated by numerous 
private schools and academies, usually meagre in outfit 
and transient in point of duration. In North Carolina, 
for example, there were reported to be 486 secondary 
schools in 1900; three years later the same authority 
reports only 283, and of these, 135 were not contained 
in the previous list. Not infrequently, where the school 
endured even so brief a period, its name changed or its 
location shifted. In Alabama, 206 private schools en- 
rolling upward of 8,000 pupils and doing both secondary 
and elementary work were reported in 1902; they were 
in the main the merest makeshifts, admittedly destined to 
“die when better public standards demand the develop-
-P-A-G-E-106
SECONDARY EDUCATION 75 
ment of modern public high schools.” Similarly, in North 
Carolina, even in the more important towns: while the 
Raleigh public school had, for instance, only seven 
grades, six private schools flourished in the town. 
Whereas in South Carolina private schools were less 
numerous and important, the ‘‘colleges’—superabun- 
dant as they were—operated “preparatory depart- 
ments,” despite the fact that the ‘“‘college” was itself, 
as a rule, merely a sort of high school, ‘‘though not 
regarded as such.’”’ Altogether, they had little endow- 
ment; for the most part they were supported by fees mod- 
est in the extreme—$60 to $75 a year in towns, and $2.50 
amonthin the country. In general, no inference as to the 
character of the enterprise could be made from the title 
by means of which these schools were described. A few 
were semi-collegiate in character; a few were. good, 
though narrow, preparatory schools; others were feeble 
schools of the same scope; many were hardly more than 
inefficient primary schools. They were largely without 
equipment of any sort; most of them offered no definite 
courses of instruction; commonly a ‘single teacher—or 
perhaps two—tutored a miscellaneous aggregation of 
boys and girls of all sizes, ages, and degrees of competency 
in a bewildering variety of ‘‘subjects.”” 
Particularly in Virginia and Tennessee, however, the 
private school was not infrequently a more substantial 
affair, though weak ventures were even in those states 
far too abundant. In Tennessee, Vanderbilt Univer- 
sity, the first Southern institution of learning to promul-
-P-A-G-E-107
76 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
gate and insist upon a definite basis for matriculation, 
had promoted the development of a number of efficient 
“fitting schools.”’ The subjects taught were conventional 
in character—Latin, Greek, Mathematics, etc.—such 
subjects, in a word, as could be successfully handled in 
unendowed schools relying on fees for maintenance and 
profit. To meet the Vanderbilt requirements certain 
schools already in existence modified and stiffened their 
programs; and a considerable number of new schools were 
established and manned largely by Vanderbilt graduates 
for the express purpose of fitting boys for the university. 
Ninety-eight such schools, claiming property valued at 
$2,358,850, with 739 instructors and 17,508 students, 
were listed by the State Superintendent in his report 
for 1904, and the list was not exhaustive. In consequence 
of the growth of these sources of supply Vanderbilt was 
enabled as far back as 1887 to discontinue its own pre- 
paratory department. The fitting school could not, of 
course, take the place of the public high school; it was too 
narrow in scope, too limited in aim. It answered, at 
best, for those who could afford to pay the tuition and 
who expected to go to college. To the larger numbers 
who craved wider opportunities, who could not pay 
the fees or for whom the secondary school must itself 
be the educational terminus, the fitting school was 
ill-adapted. But it performed, nevertheless, a genuine 
service in emphasizing the necessity of separately 
organized and competently manned schools of secondary 
type.

COLLEGE AND SECONDARY SCHOOL 
While the high school was, as has been stated above, 
confusedly involved with a poorly organized elementary 
school at one end, its relationship with the college was 
equally unsatisfactory at the other. Some of the state 
universities had indeed attempted articulation with sec- 
ondary schools by arranging “approved” or ‘“‘aux- 
iliary” lists. But recognition of this sort at that time 
signified little or nothing. The universities had no 
adequate knowledge of, or influence over, the schools; the 
schools were too commonly powerless to improve them- 
selves. Of forty-four such high schools on the approved 
list of the State University of Louisiana, eleven were at- 
tempting a course of study, complete on paper, in a 
shortened session and with a single teacher; eight of 
them enrolled fewer than fifteen pupils apiece; thirteen 
had no books of reference at all; twenty-six were without 
the least equipment for teaching physics; thirty-one 
were equally bare of equipment for teaching chemistry; in 
only six did pupils use note-books for their science work. 
Of an approved high school in Alabama it was stated at 
about the same date that the teacher had been able ‘‘by 
teaching two classes at the same time to have his pupils 
‘finish’ the courses in the allotted time’’; the school build- 
ing was described as “‘dirty, ill-kept, and foul-smelling.” 
The foregoing facts are even now recited in no un- 
sympathetic spirit. Under the circumstances nothing 
better could have been expected. Systematic public
-P-A-G-E-109
78 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
education was a new thing in the South. It could not 
spring into existence, clearly organized, satisfactorily 
manned, and decently equipped. A start had to be 
made, and in the absence of buildings, teachers, money, 
and experience, this start was bound to be chaotic. 
OBSTACLES TO DEVELOPMENT 
High schools could not, however, be created out 
of hand. Even in the cities where school boards were 
more or less free to act, money, buildings, and teachers 
were difficult to procure. In the counties and rural 
districts these serious difficulties were often com- 
plicated by the absence of favorable sentiment or by 
statutory obstacles, now negative, now positive in 
character. Neither the Constitution nor the State 
School Law of South Carolina recognized the high school 
as an essential part of the school system, further than the 
mere grant of the privilege of establishing schools of 
secondary grade; and this indifference of constitution 
and statutes proved a complete block to development. 
The obstruction in Georgia was much more serious; for 
the law provided that “there shall be a thorough system 
of common schools for the education of children in the 
elementary branches of an English education only,” and, 
further, that the ‘‘General Assembly shall zot have power 
to delegate to any county the right to levy a school tax 
for any purpose except for instructing children in the 
elementary branches of an English education only.” The 
State Department of Education could not support, as-
-P-A-G-E-110
SECONDARY EDUCATION 79 
sist, or supervise public high schools, nor could counties 
or rural districts create and sustain them. Thus pro- 
hibitive obstacles were incorporated in the fundamental 
law of the State. 
BEGINNINGS OF IMPROVEMENT 
At the same time unmistakable signs of better things 
could be discerned. The Tennessee legislature had 
already authorized county courts to provide for the estab- 
lishment and maintenance of one or more county high 
schools, by levying the necessary taxes, appropriating from 
money not already otherwise disposed of, and creating 
a special county high school fund; and several towns and 
counties had taken favorable action, though without 
concerted effort as to the length of the course, the cur- 
riculum, etc. In Mississippi, school trustees were au- 
thorized to establish in graded schools a high school course 
of four years or less with a seven months’ term, to fix 
reasonable fees, if they so chose, and to admit pupils 
from outside the district on payment of a proper fee; but 
no provision was made for state direction, supervision, 
or support. In Virginia, a state subsidy to locally 
created and sustained high schools had been proposed 
in the legislature, though without favorable action on 
the proposition as yet. In Georgia, the university, 
which had never had a preparatory department, had 
taken hold of the situation, having appointed a high 
school inspector through whose efforts an accredited list 
of fifty-one schools, only five of them private, had been
-P-A-G-E-111
80 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
got together. In this direction Mississippi had also 
been effectively busy. Observing that only 3 per cent. 
of those who passed through its preparatory department 
reached graduation, as compared with 25 per cent. of 
those who entered from outside schools, the university 
abolished the department in question in 1892 and threw 
itself deliberately on the secondary schools of the State. 
Coéperation between this institution, the State Depart- 
ment of Education, and the State Teachers’ Association 
was brought about; the high school course of study was 
revised; members of the faculty visited schools, conferring 
with patrons and trustees; and an affiliated list was made 
out, on which, in 1902, there were fifty-nine schools. 
Thus, without especially favorable legislation, aggressive 
and tactful leadership on the part of the State Univer- 
sity, in codperation with other agencies, was beginning 
to produce results. 
From these incipient endeavors to deal with the situ- 
ation, the General Education Board took its cue. A 
sound secondary school movement had already begun; 
the project was therefore not a foreign suggestion, but of 
local origin. It was in essence the response of the South- 
ern people to the increasing urgency of their own needs. 
But, for lack of resources and leadership, the local move- 
ment was making slow and irregular progress. There 
was, as a rule, no one whose business it was to inform, 
cultivate, and guide professional, public, and legislative 
opinion. There was need in every state of a trained 
specialist in secondary education, who, while sympathiz-
-P-A-G-E-112
SECONDARY EDUCATION 81 
ing with local conditions, might skilfully and tactfully 
marshal all available forces for the purpose of securing 
concerted action calculated in time to realize a secondary 
school system. 
THE PROFESSORS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Neither State Departments of Education nor State 
Universities had at the moment funds to devote to the 
promotion of such a program. At this juncture, the 
General Education Board stated its willingness to make 
appropriations to the several state universities for the 
salaries and traveling expenses of a professor of Second- 
ary Education who was to be a regular member of the 
university faculty and whose “main and principal work 
shall be to ascertain where the conditions are favorable 
for the establishment of public high schools not now in 
existence; to visit such places and to endeavor to organ- 
ize in such places public high schools in accordance with 
the laws of the State; to endeavor to create in such 
communities a public sentiment that shall permanently 
sustain such high schools, and to place the high schools 
under such local leadership as shall give them intelligent 
and wise direction, and he and the university shall ex- 
ercise a fostering care over such institutions.” 
Consistently with the policy of the General Education 
Board, these professors of secondary education became 
state and university officials, answerable to their state 
and university superiors and to them alone. The Board 
did not dictate or suggest the lines along which they
-P-A-G-E-113
82 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
should exert themselves. With a common general aim, 
the precise procedure followed was never the same in any 
two instances. The sketch above given will show how 
the local situations varied: here the law was fairly favor- 
able, there fatally obstructive, in another place passively 
permissive. Here the field was more or less encumbered 
with private schools; there it was relatively open. In 
one state, sentiment was more or less favorable, and efforts 
were already making; another was indifferent; a third, 
perhaps, hostile. Under such circumstances, workers 
could share an ultimate ideal and could meet to exchange 
experiences, but they could not follow a single path. In 
any event, the General Education Board was satisfied 
to provide the necessary funds which would enable the 
State University, the State Department of Education, 
the high school representative, and other interested 
agencies to work out the local problem in whatever way 
their own judgment approved. 
The first contract of this character was madein Virginia, 
in 1905; the latest in Kentucky, in 1910. Codperative 
work in this field is now under way in the following eleven 
states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Virginia, and West Virginia. In Louisiana, the work 
begun by the Board in 1907 has been taken over by the 
state. 
THEIR METHODS OF WORK 
In no state was a cut and dried program pursued. The 
professors of secondary education were in the first place
-P-A-G-E-114
SECONDARY EDUCATION 83 
critical students, each of the conditions in his own state. 
Their reports contain accurate and detailed accounts of 
secondary education from the standpoint of law, local 
sentiment, the number and value of school buildings, 
school equipment, cost, curriculum, teaching, enrolment, 
etc. For the first time thoroughly reliable information 
procured at first hand became available; it was, moreover, 
diffused through special bulletins and through the re- 
ports of State Superintendents, so that the Southern 
people learned to face frankly the facts of their situation. 
In addition, the professors of secondary education were 
high school evangelists, traveling well-nigh incessantly 
from county to county, returning from time to time to the 
State University to do their teaching, or to the State 
Capitol to confer with the State Superintendent. Wher- 
ever they went, they addressed the people, the local 
school authorities, the county court, teachers, business 
men and business organizations, county and state con- 
ferences, etc. They sought almost any sort of opportu- 
nity in order to scorea point. Lawor no law, they urged 
their hearers to make voluntary efforts toward a county 
high school, if a start had not yet been made; to add a 
grade or a teacher to a school already started; to repair 
the building or to provide a new one; to consolidate 
weak district schools into a larger one adequate to town 
or county needs. Nor did they merely expose defects, 
tender advice, and employ exhortation: they not only 
urged a policy, but nursed a situation. By correspond- 
ence they kept in touch with places already visited; from
-P-A-G-E-115
84 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
time to time they returned, to renew pressure or to rec- 
ognize achievement. Especially in their earlier efforts 
they relied largely on the contagion of example, and skil- . 
fully played off one vicinity against another. By this 
method, five county high schools having been previously 
established, eleven more were started in Tennessee by 
the efforts of the secondary school representative in his 
very first year; thereafter counties were the more easily 
persuaded, coaxed, or shamed into activity. A small 
Virginia county seat had a $100,000 courthouse; bonds 
had been issued for that, for waterworks, sewerage, and 
electric lights; but six hundred children went to school in 
an obsolete and inadequate building. An agreement 
was practically extorted from the town fathers to pre- 
serve the next surplus for a high school and to utilize 
the credit margin still remaining for the same purpose. 
A North Carolina town of some 10,000 inhabitants, with 
fair private schools, had done nothing in the way of public 
schools. ‘Indeed there is a lingering prejudice against 
public education—a relic of the time when a public 
school was regarded as a charity school.”” A movement to 
set up public schools being endangered by local rivalries, 
the secondary school representative exerted himself 
to bring about harmony, and the election vindicated his 
efforts. Similar incidents might be quoted from every 
other Southern state. 
The work has been extremely trying. Fortunately 
the men were young, hardy, and enthusiastic—pioneers 
in physique, as they were evangelists in spirit. “After

breakfast, the County Superintendent and I””—so reads 
a characteristic report—‘started across country to Fall 
Branch, seventeen miles from Jonesboro. We addressed 
a good crowd of citizens, and three members of the county 
court who were present promised to vote for the high 
school tax. At 3.30 we were due at a church twenty-two 
miles distant. The roads were very bad, our carriage 
broke down, and we failed to reach the church in time. 
Returning to Jonesboro, we had supper and drove to 
Telford, from which place we planned to get to Washing- 
ton College for a night meeting. But transportation 
was lacking. It was dark and raining, but we walked 
three miles to the college, and found a good crowd waiting 
for us.”” The most isolated section of Virginia lies north 
of the York River and east of Fredericksburg. There is 
not a foot of railway in it, though it is rich in agricultural, 
fishing, and lumbering industries. ‘‘We found traveling 
difficult; naphtha launches, midnight steamers, relays 
of buggies had to be relied on. During one dusty day 
we traveled in three different vehicles, held three differ- 
ent meetings with school trustees, waited till midnight for 
a boat, rode till five in the morning, and after sleeping 
two hours, arose, held another meeting, and drove twenty 
miles to catch a train.” In the summer of 1906 the 
Tennessee representative and the State Superintendent 
made a campaign that touched every county in the 
state. Its central purpose was to impress upon the 
people the importance of having a complete and well- 
articulated school system from the elementary school in
-P-A-G-E-118
86 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
the rural districts through the high school and normal 
school to the university. The attendance at this series 
of mass meetings ranged from one hundred to seven 
thousand—perhaps one thousand being the average. 
The meetings began in Memphis, July 2oth, and closed at 
the opposite end of the state just three months later 
to the day; seventy-nine towns had been visited and one 
hundred and fifty speakers had participated, the Gover- 
nor, university and college presidents among the number. 
These efforts are fairly representative of one phase of the 
activities of the professors of secondary education. 
FAVORABLE LEGISLATION 
It was from the first clear that sporadic successes due 
to voluntary initiative on the part of interested commu- 
nities would not suffice. They could, at best, whet the 
appetite for a substantial secondary school system. Aside 
from local benefit, they were, however, valuable because 
they reduced opposition to satisfactory legislation—con- 
stitutional or statutory as the case might be. Within 
less than a decade important legislative gains have been 
made. In Georgia the prohibitions above noted have 
been expunged from the State Constitution: counties 
and school districts may now vote local taxes by two 
thirds of those voting; under which provision thirty-nine 
counties and some nine hundred school districts have 
taken affirmative action. By two other amendments, 
the limitation of public education to “the elements of an 
English education only” has been removed; a State
-P-A-G-E-119
SECONDARY EDUCATION 87 
Board of Education has been created, and a comprehen- 
sive system of licensing has just been started. Florida 
has amended its constitution so as to enable school dis- 
tricts to sell bonds to provide school buildings and equip- 
ment; and steps have been taken to insure higher quali- 
fications for the teaching license. State grants in aid 
of high schools locally started, not yet brought about in 
all the states, are at any rate now made in South Caro- 
lina, North Carolina, Florida, Arkansas, West Virginia, 
and Virginia, while Tennessee has materially increased 
its allowance; qualifications for teachers in assisted high 
schools have been set up in Georgia, Arkansas, Tennes- 
see, North Carolina, and West Virginia; county agricul- 
‘tural high schools have been established in Alabama and 
Mississippi; legislation favorable to the establishment 
of farm life schools and farm life departments has been 
passed in North Carolina. The foregoing account is 
not exhaustive; but it shows that the Southern states 
are now in a fair way to provide the proper basis for an 
adequate secondary school system. 
It can fairly be said that in framing and putting 
through this legislation the high school representatives 
supported by the General Education Board have in 
every instance taken a leading part. They would, how- 
ever, be the first to refuse any undue credit. The or- 
ganizations already mentioned—the Peabody Board, the 
Southern Education Board, and the Conference for Edu- 
cation in the South—had greatly stimulated the demand 
for adequate and orderly educational facilities; in every
-P-A-G-E-120
88 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
state, local bodies and organizations, state aad local 
officials were working along one line or another to arouse 
educational interest. The secondary school men profited 
immensely by all this activity; at the same time they 
made their own valuable contribution by directing effort 
toward a definite and valuable object. 
RESULTS 
Favorable legislation has been generally followed by 
immediate results, so ripe was the situation everywhere 
for action. The Alabama law in regard to county high 
schools required that towns in which these schools are 
located must furnish at least five acres of ground and a 
building costing not less than $5,000. Eighteen counties 
promptly promised buildings costing $277,000, no place 
offering less than twice the minimum required by law; 
supplemental local appropriations for annual support 
to the extent of $1,000 to $2,000 were voted; and light. 
water, and fuel were also promised in some instances. 
The town of Prescott, Arkansas, was a disappointed 
competitor for one of the new State Agricultural High 
Schools, despite a generous offer of money and land. 
The citizens were, however, induced by the high school 
representative to turn over to the local school board what 
the state had not accepted; and the little town thus came 
into possession of a building costing $24,000, exclusive of 
furniture, a farm of thirty acres, a four-year high school 
course with electives in science, manual training, do- 
mestic science, and agriculture.

The passage of a law marked the beginning of new 
endeavors rather than the cessation of old ones—en- 
deavors to induce the communities to make the fullest 
use of the opportunities for high school development 
created by the legislation just obtained. The methods 
followed by the secondary school men may indeed be 
commended as ideally adapted to the promotion of edu- 
cational and social reform. Their homes were in the 
states they served; they took up a sympathetic attitude 
toward local problems and conditions; acquainted them- 
selves with the history and resources of the states; dealt 
candidly and plainly with every constituency—on the 
one hand without passion or sensationalism, on the 
other without the faintest suspicion of exploitation or 
the faintest imputation of self-interest; proposed meas- 
ures that were within range of possibility, at the same 
time that they were essential parts of a far-reaching 
scheme to be developed bit by bit as opportunity 
afforded. In homely language, they have kept “‘pegging 
away,” quietly, persistently, and with ultimate purposes 
far beyond the immediate propositions, the adoption of 
which they have urged at any particular place or any 
particular moment. Their progress has not been marked 
by explosions which shake a state like an earthquake, 
and are presently forgotten when some new exposure in 
another field takes place; but interest and enthusiasm 
have steadily grown on the basis of achievement, with- 
out any liability to reaction or any sign of revulsion of 
feeling.

NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOLS 
A few statistics will convey an idea of what has thus 
far been accomplished. It has been pointed out above 
that a decade ago or less, the four-year high school, 
properly so-called, was practically non-existent in the 
South outside a few large towns; that in general the high 
school was for the most part vague and formless. Though, 
as we shall see, the term “‘high school’’ does not yet mean 
the same thing or the same sort of thing everywhere, it 
is nowadays used in the South with a fair degree of 
critical caution. In this sense, since the appointment 
of the ‘‘Professor of Secondary Education,” 174 four- 
year high schools have been established in Virginia, 110 
in North Carolina,’ 78 in Georgia, 88 in Alabama, 37 
in Tennessee, 18 in South Carolina, 13 in Florida, 31 in 
Mississippi, 62 in Arkansas, 15 in West Virginia. Three- 
year high schools, many of which will shortly add the 
missing year, are numerous: Georgia has started 132, 
North Carolina too, Arkansas 60, Virginia 146, West 
Virginia 12, Tennessee 37, South Carolina 88, Alabama 
23, Florida 14. 
STUDENT ENROLMENTS 
With this development, the enrolment of pupils has 
kept pace. The high schools of Georgia enrol 25,000 
pupils; those of Alabama over 20,000 boys and girls; 
those of Mississippi over 10,000; North Carolina, 8,500   
1 Of these, sixty-two are rural, forty-eight city, high schools.
-P-A-G-E-124
SECONDARY EDUCATION or 
in the country, and 8,000 in towns; Virginia, over 18,000. 
In Kentucky there has been an increase in attendance 
of 4,000 in three years. In the final year of the four- 
year high schools the enrolment is, of course, still modest: 
550 in the rural high schools and 950 in the city high 
schools of North Carolina; .470 in South Carolina; 1,143 . 
in Arkansas; in Mississippi, about 1,000; in Georgia, 
1,241; in Tennessee, 715; in Virginia, 1,613; boys and 
girls are included in all these figures. The number of 
full-time high school teachers—teachers not distracted 
by having to do also odds and ends of primary work—is 
keeping pace; South Carolina employed 160 in 1906, and 
412 in 1913—a gain of almost 160 per cent., indicative 
of a far keener appreciation of the importance of an ade- 
quately trained teaching body, for more and more of 
these full-time teachers are college graduates. In the 
same way Tennessee employs 392 full-time teachers in the 
117 four-year, three-year, and two-year high schools 
established since 1905; Arkansas 106 in the 99 high 
schools set up since 1908. In Georgia full-time teachers 
increased from 149 to 443 between 1905 and 1914. 
IMPROVED BUILDINGS 
In this same period very considerable sums have been 
invested in new school buildings of improved type: 
$1,750,000 in North Carolina, $1,500,000 in Florida, 
$1,265,000 in South Carolina, $2,500,000 in Mississippi, 
a little under $2,000,000 in Tennessee, almost $3,000,000 
1 Often used for the grades as well.  
-P-A-G-E-125
92 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
in West Virginia, more than $3,000,000 in Georgia, and 
more than $4,000,000 in Virginia.1 The state appor- 
tionments in aid of high schools locally maintained are 
beginning to reach considerable dimensions; for this 
purpose, Alabama has already paid almost $1,000,000; 
Georgia, $659,600; Tennessee, $282,940; North Caro- 
lina, $500,000; South Carolina, over $300,000. Private 
subscription is perhapsmostsignificant of all. In Alabama 
$685,000 has been thus donated, the relatively large 
sum being accounted for by the difficulties in the way of 
raising funds by taxation; in Tennessee, where taxation 
has been relatively liberal, private parties have contrib- 
uted $172,000 toward high school buildings and equip- 
ment; in North Carolina, $250,000. A few cuts printed 
as illustrations (pages 84 to 98) convey some notion 
of the improvements now taking place in Southern 
school architecture. These buildings are, of course, still 
the exception; but they represent what is rapidly be- 
coming a general ambition to dignify education by mak- 
ing the schoolhouse one of the most striking and at- 
tractive buildings in the community.

The foregoing account reveals a movement rich in 
promise. But the point adverted to in dealing with the 
farm demonstrations may well be emphasized anew in 
this connection. As yet only a beginning has been 
made. Eight years ago the term “high school”? con. 
veyed in the South no definite meaning; now it represents 
a fairly well conceived educational entity, the place, 
scope, and requirements of which are quite widely appre- 
ciated. The experience of Arkansas may be cited in 
illustration. There the endeavor has been made not 
only to add to the number of complete high schools and 
to get the children into them, but to give the term “high 
school” a clear, substantial meaning. The state aid 
law, passed in 1911, requires assisted schools to conform
-P-A-G-E-128
94 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
to a standard in length of term, length of recitation period, 
number of teachers, course of study, etc. These require- 
ments are defined by the State Board of Education, of 
which the professor of secondary education is not only a 
member, but the secretary and school inspector. The first 
year more than one hundred schools met the standard; 
now, after the law has been in force only three years, 
practically all high schools, whether receiving state aid 
or not, are organized and operated in accordance with 
the regulations of the State Board. 
The vastness of the task still to be achieved is fully 
realized by those who have been the pioneers in the entire 
movement. Their reports from month to month and 
year to year emphasize again and again the defects and 
shortcomings characteristic of even a satisfactorily devel- 
oping situation. The high schools are rarely full-grown; 
many of them are meagre; many of them have shot up 
almost too rapidly and must fill out in the coming years. 
Separate buildings are still relatively rare; a numerous, 
stable, and properly qualified teaching and supervising 
profession has yet to be created, even though a beginning 
has been made. 
It is unnecessary in a volume of this kind to attempt an 
exhaustive discussion of even the more urgent high school 
problems with which the secondary school representa- 
tives are now dealing. But one or two may be singled 
out, on account of their more than local interest: and in 
the very first place, the question of the high school cur- 
riculum.

SECONDARY EDUCATION 95 
THE HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM 
At the outset, the course of study of the newly estab- 
lished high school naturally follows conventional lines; 
this is indeed at once the easiest and the cheapest thing 
to do. The close relationship of the high school to the 
state university rather accentuates this tendency. For 
the university begins by formulating its entrance require- 
ments in terms of the traditional cultural subjects. On 
the other hand, the extent to which the people have di- 
rectly participated in demanding and paying for the new 
Southern high schools was bound to emphasize another 
aspect of high school usefulness. The Southern people 
want high schools not only as cultural luxuries, but as 
aids in the solution of political, social, and economic 
difficulties. The most casual visitor in the South must 
indeed be impressed by the well-nigh universal recogni- 
tion there of the existence of problems bequeathed to the 
present and to succeeding generations by the collapse 
of the ancient social and economic régime. The South 
has been convinced that education alone can hope to 
achieve any kind of solution. Graded schools, high 
schools, and state universities have been supported with 
increasing interest and liberality on the basis of this 
newly acquired faith. 
The high school curriculum must under these circum- 
stances face both ways, whether its pupils subsequently 
attend college or not. It must make an immediate re- 
sponse to present local needs, whatever they are. It
-P-A-G-E-131
96‘ THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
must, on the other hand, be calculated to widen the scope 
of its pupils, to create fresh intellectual and spiritual 
needs not at the moment acutely felt. These two objects 
are not mutually repugnant to each other; indeed, the 
first is one of the conditions on which the development of 
the second depends. If the Southern school man has 
often been militantly aggressive in his criticism of the 
old-fashioned literary or academic course of study, it does 
not mean that he sees no good in it; he has only wanted to 
put it in its proper place, to deprive it of its monopoly, 
to make room for other types of wholesome activity, and 
to pay proper regard to the large numbers who never go to 
college. In every Southern state the high school cur- 
riculum has thus been thoroughly ventilated in the last 
few years; and with already noticeable results. At 
formal and informal gatherings efforts have been made 
to reach some agreement as to why this or that subject 
should be taught, how, and how much. The cause of the 
new interests—agriculture, domestic art, business meth- 
ods—has been discussed earnestly and effectively. ‘The 
discussions revolved around the present course of study,” 
writes one of the men at the beginning of his service, 
‘fan inelastic, hidebound thing, well enough adapted to 
the making of preachers, lawyers, and doctors, provided 
boys are so inclined, but wholly unfit for the teaching of 
agriculture in a practical way. As the representative 
of the State Department of Education I plead with all 
my might for the formulation and adoption of a new 
course of study in which agriculture, home economics, and
-P-A-G-E-132
SECONDARY EDUCATION 97 
kindred topics should hold the central place. As a 
result, a committee was appointed to prepare such a 
course and to report to the next meeting.” 
The soundness of this point of view at this moment is 
now generally conceded by Southern educators. Ten- 
nessee has therefore wisely decided to duplicate out of the 
State Fund all local appropriations for the teaching 
of agriculture, domestic science, and manual training up 
_ to $1,500 annually; Virginia appropriated, in 1908, 
$20,000 for agricultural and manual training departments 
in ten high schools, and two years later doubled the sum. 
North Carolina encourages farm-life schools and farm- 
life departments in high schools, the state and county 
each contributing $2,500 a year for support. Georgia 
has created eleven district agricultural high schools, each 
enjoying an annual appropriation of $10,000; toward 
these the counties have contributed $830,000. Of the 
county agricultural high schools, those of Mississippi 
may be taken as excellent examples. Generally speaking, 
these schools, co-educational in character, are aiming to 
train intelligent farmers and farmers’ wives. They have 
been built with distinct reference to the state’s need. They 
are country-life schools in an environment where the rural 
problem is vast, promising, and as yet hardly touched. 
The course of study covers four years; every boy pursues 
agriculture, every girl home economics, through the entire 
curriculum. Biology, applied physics and chemistry, sani- 
tation and hygiene, tooland bench work, blacksmithing, and 
the usual English branches complete the course of study.
-P-A-G-E-133
98 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
These and other high schools are likely to become 
centres for many of the forces now stirring in rural life. 
The farm demonstration work may be connected with 
them; boys’ and girls’ clubs are so connected already. 
To helpful work of the demonstration type there need 
be no arbitrary limit. A resourceful teacher of domestic 
science in one of them immediately perceived that the 
type of domestic science which she had pursued at 
college was not adapted to this environment. She vis- 
ited homes throughout the county in order to formulate 
her local problem. On the basis of that experience her 
girls have been trained to attend the sick with care and 
intelligence, and to bathe, dress, and prepare food and 
clothing for an infant. ‘‘I observed,” she said, “‘that the 
tural sick suffer less from disease than from discomfort, 
and that the babies of the county need clean and in- 
telligent management.”’ Nor does it follow that educa- 
tion must be mean, unimaginative, lacking in ideal 
content, simply because it is mindful of such humble and 
vital necessities. 
COLLEGE RELATIONSHIP 
Attention has been called to the fact that at the outset 
the university and college influence made for a narrow 
course of study and so hampered the responsiveness of the 
high school to immediate needs. This has largely ceased 
to be the case, the colleges showing more and more dis- 
position to enlarge the basis of matriculation. A very 
acute problem in respect to college and high school rela-

      New District Graded and High School, Princeton, W. Va.
-P-A-G-E-135
SECONDARY EDUCATION 99 
tionship nevertheless remains. The South, like the coun- 
try at large, maintains an excessive number of collegiate 
institutions; at the same time Southern highschools, as the 
figures above given show, are still graduating a relatively. 
small number of fully trained pupils. If the Southern 
colleges all supported the high school movement and 
refused to receive students who had not»passed satis-. 
factorily through the local high schools, many of ‘them 
would be without students; if the colleges are bent upon 
surviving, not a few of them must compete with the high 
schools for students. The more important institutions 
in every state have, generally speaking, cordially co- 
operated in reaching an understanding on this point. 
Conferences have been held and resolutions adopted con- 
demning the practice of receiving students into college 
before they have finished the high school courses at their 
home schools. State Associations of Colleges have been 
formed to safeguard this policy. As soon as the situa- 
tion permitted-—sometimes even earlier—they clarified 
and raised their entrance requirements in order to effect 
a close and real articulation with the new high schools. 
But the institutions that have not pursued this policy, 
and that can pursue it only if they are willing to subor- 
dinate themselves to the general educational good, con- 
stitute a serious difficulty. They exist in every state. 
Especial efforts to procure and publish the facts have, 
however, been made in South Carolina. ‘Unless the 
territory of the high school and that of the college be 
clearly differentiated, and at the same time contiguous,”
-P-A-G-E-136
100 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
writes the secondary school representative in 1910, 
“these institutions will be continually trespassing upon 
each other’s territory.”’ Annually since that time the 
«\\\ bulletins of the University of South Carolina publish 
a list of ‘college students ‘“‘untimely ripped” by the 
colleges of the state from the high schools where they 
should ‘have, remained a year or two longer. In 1910, 
i oubof more\than 200 pupils reported by the high schools 
as having left,,before completing the courses offered, 
82 entered colleges.”” In subsequent years the matter is 
pursued in even greater detail, the name of the pupil 
and his high school standing, together with the name of 
the cdllege and the class to which he (or she) was admitted, 
being printed. The argument has been pressed with 
vigor and ingenuity. ‘More than one half the high 
school communities of the state are impoverishing their 
own high schools by taking their sons and daughters 
away and sending them to college at a heavier expense 
than the entire high school at home. It is strange that a 
man of ordinary business sagacity will take his child out 
of the high school, where it costs him not exceeding $25 
a year, and send him off to college to do the same work 
at a cost of $250.”’ Again: ‘Colleges do not hesitate 
to take pupils from different classes in the same high 
school and put them into the same college class. In 
several colleges, first-year, second-year, and third-year 
high school pupils are side by side in the freshman class.” 
Efforts to complete the high school course are thus de- 
feated: “‘We had to give up our eleventh grade; the
-P-A-G-E-137
SECONDARY EDUCATION IO 
colleges have broken it up,” writes one principal. ‘‘Our 
eleventh grade is very small; two colleges robbed us of our 
tenth grade pupils during my summer vacation,” writes 
another. It is needless to quote further illustrations; but 
the problem must be borne in mind, for we shall return 
to it in considering the policy of the General Education 
Board in dealing with colleges and universities.! 
HIGH SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION 
There can, of course, be too many high schools, pre- 
cisely as there are too many colleges. The consolidation 
of district into town or county high schools must there- 
fore be an object steadily kept in mind. As soon as high 
school classes begin to multiply in scattered elementary 
schools, a campaign to concentrate the high school grades 
into a centrally located high school is in order. The 
teaching of high school subjects in one-teacher rural 
schools is still widely permitted, and with woful results. 
Hence, it is important to beware of excessive emphasis on 
the increased number of high schools; from time to time a 
fall in numbers would be more truly indicative of health. 
Laurens County, S. C., for example, supported at a total 
cost of less than $11,000 eight state aided high schools in 
1910, with fourteen full-time teachers, and 338 pupils; 
yet not one boasted a fourth year. The substitution of a 
county for a district system would facilitate a process of 
consolidation through which two or three good and com- 
plete schools would supplant thrice the number of feeble 
1See pp. 109-110.
-P-A-G-E-138
102 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
ones. This policy has indeed been pursued in the newer 
states. Colorado, with three times the territory of 
South Carolina, and 4,000 more high school pupils in 
1910, had go high schools as against South Carolina’s 156. 
Other difficulties attendant on a new and rapid educa- 
tional development need not detain us now. It goes 
without saying that more and better buildings, more and 
better equipment, above all, more and better teachers, 
are needed. Emulation will in time supply the buildings 
and equipment. Efforts have from the outset been made 
to improve the present body of teachers, by normal train- 
ing, by teachers’ institutes, by summer schools, bulletins, 
and by special classes at the state universities and normal 
schools. A new agency, of whose beneficent influence 
high hopes are entertained, is the George Peabody Col- 
lege for Teachers at Nashville, which promises to address 
itself soberly and intelligently both to improving the 
present profession and to training a new and better one.

V. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
establishment and management of higher insti- 
tutions of learning is unique. The universities 
of continental Europe are governmental institutions, sup- 
ported by governmental appropriations and conducted 
by a department presided over by a cabinet minister. 
The contribution of private individuals or private organ- 
izations and associations in the way of gifts or even coun- 
sel is negligibly small. In England, ancient corporations 
furnished for centuries such facilities as existed for higher 
education; latterly, flourishing municipalities have be- 
stirred themselves with notable results in the establish- 
ment of universities, the resources of which have been 
supplemented by grants in aid made by the national 
government. T=: situation in the United States in respect to the 
THE AMERICAN SYSTEM 
Our American system is much more complicated. 
Neither the national government nor any one of the 
states has accepted the responsibility of providing ade- 
quately for higher education. Some of the states do 
little in this direction, leaving practically the whole field 
to private initiative; even those states that maintain 
universities have never proposed to dispense with pri- 
103
-P-A-G-E-140
104 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
vately endowed and managed institutions; the general 
government has limited itself to the making of appro- 
priations to agricultural and mechanical colleges, with- 
out, however, supervising the expenditure of the funds 
thus contributed. 
Generally speaking, therefore, it may be said that in 
the United States there is a wide-open door in so far as 
higher education is concerned. Individuals and organ- 
izations are free to establish and support institutions of 
higher learning, and it is expected that they will do so. 
This expectation has not, as a matter of fact, been dis- 
appointed. In the first place, religious bodies have 
plentifully planted colleges and universities, in order to 
protect their several denominations and to secure a com- 
petently educated ministry. From these foundations, 
ecclesiastical in origin, many of the strongest and broad- 
est of our higher institutions have developed in a com. 
paratively brief space of time. Again, a majority of the 
states themselves have created universities by way of 
rounding out their several public school systems. Finally, 
a small number of strong institutions, independent alike 
of religious denominations and the several states, have 
been endowed by single individuals. 
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES 
Our easy-going treatment of this important matter has 
developed many advantages. People at large have 
been made to feel responsible for their own higher educa- 
tion, with the result that nowhere else in the world does
-P-A-G-E-141
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 105 
so much popular interest in higher education exist. An 
enormous amount of energy has been thus liberated; and 
sacrifice for ideal educational ends—a rare phenomenon 
in the rest of the world—has become usual in America. 
It would, however, be idle to deny that very grave 
evils have also resulted. If only some general concep- 
tion or purpose could from the outset have controlled the 
planting and development of higher institutions of learn- 
ing, all might have been well. But no such ideal has at 
any time dominated or even greatly influenced the course 
of events. Political, local, denominational, and purely 
personal factors have too often proved determinative. 
Waste and confusion have been the consequence. States 
that might have developed a strong and symmetrical 
university as the crown of a public school system have 
often either multiplied institutions or split up the univer- 
sity into several fragments so distributed as to placate 
political sentiment; rival religious bodies have invaded 
fields fully—or more than fully—occupied already; mis- 
guided individuals have founded a new college instead 
of strengthening an old one. Thus institutions have 
been born which could not possibly grow up—superfluous 
institutions that interfere seriously with the nutrition 
of those really needed. 
GOVERNMENT CONTROL 
A problem that gravely concerns both the states and 
the nation results; for on the efficient organization of 
higher education depends not only the highest culture
-P-A-G-E-142
106 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
of certain selected individuals, but the vigor and effective- 
ness of the primary and secondary school systems as well. 
The facts brought out in considering secondary education 
in the South—facts that can be more or less paralleled 
in other sections of the country—amply sustain this 
view. On the terms upon which the colleges admit 
students the quality and performance of the schools to a 
large extent depend. Moreover, the colleges train the 
men and women who teach in the lower schools; the com- 
petency of the colleges, therefore, determines the quality 
and performance of the schools. 
There is no indication that in the near future either 
state or national government will fearlessly endeavor to 
bring order out of the chaos just described; our ‘“‘open- 
door’’ tradition is too deeply rooted; too many vested 
interests have been created; too many incidental issues 
are involved. Best of all, too much that is admirable 
has come to pass under our present methods. The condi- 
tions that produced Harvard, Williams, Johns Hopkins, 
the University of Chicago, and half a hundred other 
well-established institutions of learning, are not to be 
lightly discarded. More especially in these days of large 
fortunes, nothing must be done to deprive private in- 
itiative of incentive and opportunity, or—more than all 
—actual responsibility. It is therefore not probable 
that the several states will soon utilize their authority to 
regulate the founding, development, and conduct of col- 
leges and universities. Thus far, only a single state has 
created a department-of education armed with anything
-P-A-G-E-143
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 107 
approaching adequate powers; and in this instance it 
has been found that these powers must be employed with 
the utmost circumspection. To state action, even in the 
form of control, there is, in any event, always the objec- 
tion that it tends to decreased flexibility, thus lessening 
experimental activity and innovation amidst changing 
social conditions that cry aloud for both. Finally, 
whatever may be the case hereafter, up to this time the 
states have not generally shown themselves competent 
to deal with higher education on a non-partisan, imper- 
sonal, and comprehensive basis. 
SCOPE FOR PRIVATE INITIATIVE 
If private initiative can enjoy such immense creative 
opportunities in higher education, is it not conceivable 
that its collected experience may be brought to bear on 
the very problems that these same opportunities create? 
The field is rich and diverse; it contains state institutions, 
privateinstitutions,anddenominationalinstitutions. Can 
not the responsible heads of such institutions, represent- 
ing the widest contemporary experience and the soundest 
contemporary judgment, be brought to reflect on the con- 
ditions in which they all find themselves? An organiza- 
tion of this type represents another step in the evolution 
of private initiative—the effort, in other words, of free- 
dom to control and guide itself. Such an organization 
would have no authority. It could, at most, hope to at- 
tain influence; and the extent of its influence would in the 
long run depend altogether on its helpfulness. A varied
-P-A-G-E-144
108 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
membership would tend to eliminate irrelevant consider- 
ations and to make for the prevalence of broad views of 
educational policy. The presence of a strong lay ele- 
ment in its composition would tend to keep it respon- 
sive to public as well as to professional opinion. In a 
word, a body of this kind might hope to remedy some of 
the defects attending unhampered individual initiative 
by utilizing private initiative and its experience in another 
fashion. THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
In respect to higher education, the General Education 
Board has sought to be useful to the academic depart- 
ments of colleges and universities! in this way. Accord- 
ing to the terms of Mr. Rockefeller’s second gift, the 
Board was to assist ‘‘such institutions of learning as the 
Board may deem best adapted to promote a comprehen- 
sive system of higher education in the United States.” 
From the standpoint of the amount of money appropri- 
ated and the amount of attention bestowed, this hasindeed 
been the most important of the Board’s activities. The 
general situation to be dealt with was already well under- 
stood. But systematic studies were at once undertaken 
for the purpose of learning the details in so far as col- 
leges and universities were concerned. Efforts were 
made to ascertain the number of institutions of higher 
learning in the country, the purposes for which, and the 
1 The Board has as yet made no appropriations to professional depart- 
ments, except medicine: See pp. 166-172. A single appropriation has 
been made to a technological institute, viz., $250,000 to the Stevens In- 
stitute of Technology.

agencies through which, they had been chartered, their 
location, their resources, their possible sources of strength, 
and, with the utmost particularity, their relations to their 
respective communities, educationally and otherwise. 
NUMBER AND CHARACTER OF COLLEGES 
AND UNIVERSITIES 
Exclusive of technical institutions, there were in 1902 
something like 700 institutions in the United States call- 
ing themselves colleges or universities. The geographical 
distribution of 687 of these is indicated on the accompany- 
ing map (Figure 10). A glance is enough to show the 
absurdity of the situation. Institutions in such numbers 
cannot be supported, cannot be manned, cannot pro- 
cure qualified students. The State of Ohio, with a total 
population of 4,767,121, contains over 40 so-called 
colleges and universities, almost twice as many as the 
entire German Empire, with a population of 64,903,423; 
Missouri (population 3,293,335) contains 34, Pennsyl- 
vania (population 7,665,111) contains 41, Tennessee 
(population 2,184,789) contains 29, Maryland (popula- 
tion 1,295,346) contains 20, Iowa (population 2,224,771) 
contains 32; other states are in substantially the same 
position. 
An examination of the scope and facilities of the above- 
mentioned institutions proved that many of them were 
hardly more than secondary schools, not always good 
secondary schools at that; and that others offered only 
one or two years of college work. Only a minority were
-P-A-G-E-146
      
 
-P-A-G-E-147
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES Tmt 
rightly called college or university. A small number 
articulated definitely with the secondary schools of their 
respective states; not a few, however, competed with the 
secondary schools, ‘‘robbing local high schools of their 
pupils,” as we have already learned. Very few were 
found to confine themselves to such work as they were 
equipped to do, or to work for which need and oppor- 
tunity existed. Imitation had led some of the better to 
cherish unwarranted academic ambitions; well-nigh all 
were dangerously, and many were fatally, extended. It 
has been pointed out that no general design had con- 
trolled their location or establishment; harmonious rela- 
tions did not even exist between institutions established 
under the same auspices—whether state or denomi- 
national; larger codperation between all the institutions 
of a given state had not yet been thought of. Local, 
institutional, or denominational pride, vanity, or self- 
interest, propped up tottering, feeble, or superfluous in- 
stitutions, some of them established in this or that state 
or county for no better reason than that a small town 
wanted one, or a rival denomination already had one. 
Of course worthier motives in abundance also played 
their part. Many of these schools, seriously defective 
according to modern ideas, had done good work under the 
pioneer conditions that have only lately passed away; 
splendid devotion and _ self-sacrifice had gone into 
their making, and their graduates had been important 
factors in the development of their respective communi- 
ties.

FINANCIAL SITUATION 
Meanwhile, whatever their origin and tradition, in- 
stitutions were—and still are—generally suffering from 
the pressure of need. Financial strength and security 
are indeed far rarer than is commonly believed. In the 
accompanying series of maps an effort is made to portray 
the existing situation.1. Only twenty-five institutions 
of higher learning located in seventeen different states 
(Figure 11) enjoy total annual incomes from all sources 
—endowment, tuition, fees, etc.—of $500,000 or more. 
If this is regarded as too severe a criterion, assuredly a 
total annual income from all sources of $200,000 will in 
these days sustain only a modest university: forty 
states contain about eighty-five institutions receiving 
that amount or more annually (Figure 12). The time 
is fast approaching, if indeed it is not already here, 
when it will be conceded to be impossible for an aca- 
demic institution to do justice to its students on a 
total income from all sources of less than $100,000 a 
year: considerably less than one fourth of our colleges 
and universities (one hundred and forty or thereabouts) 
now enjoy an income of that size (Figure 13). A very 
large number of institutions, some of them doing well, 
though clearly showing the strain, operate with an 
annual budget between $50,000 and $100,000 (Figure 
14). One hundred and seventy-six have to live on

$25,000 a year or less—an absolutely impossible under- 
taking, if efficiency is to be secured (Figure 15). On 
this showing the necessity of strengthening colleges 
and universities on the financial side and of concentrating 
aid on those upon which the main burden falls is obvi- 
ous. 
POLICY OF THE BOARD 
Whatever policy the Board might elect to pursue, two 
preliminary decisions were reached, neither of which has 
ever been departed from, either in letter or in spirit. 
The Board had no authority, and desired no authority; 
and its membership must be its sole title to influence. 
It was therefore resolved to put no pressure, direct or 
indirect, upon any college or university with a view to 
influencing its course of action; it was resolved that in 
“making appropriations the Board would in no wise inter- 
fere with the internal management of an institution, and 
would incur absolutely no responsibility for its conduct 
in any respect. Informal discussion and conversation 
between the officers of the Board and college or univer- 
sity representatives have been, indeed, frequent, but the 
unanimous testimony of those participating declares 
that the spirit of the above-mentioned decisions has 
never been infringed. The General Education Board 
has left to the discretion of every institution with which 
it has in any way had relations complete power to shape 
its own course, externally and internally. It has held 
that the higher institutions of learning must in the end

work out their own salvation, and that they are most 
likely to do this effectually if they are comfortable 
financially. 
LAWS OF COLLEGE GROWTH 
(a) Importance of Location 
In the selection of institutions to be assisted, the 
Board has been guided by what appear to be the laws of 
college growth, as revealed by the experience of a century, 
The student of college development is struck at the outset 
by the fact that the subject must be approached, not from 
the standpoint of the Union as a whole, but from that of 
the several states. Education is, in the United States, a 
state function, precisely as it is in the various federated 
states abroad.' We can have only such a national system 
as results from adding together the separate state sys- 
tems. Moreover, state lines have always counted heavily 
in determining the area of college or university influence. 
The state line is a formidable barrier. The circle from 
which a college chiefly obtains its students is rarely 
two hundred miles, and usually not over one hundred in 
diameter. If we draw circles around each American col- 
lege fifty and one hundred miles from its halls, and trace 
every student to his home, we shall most frequently find 
the homes of the majority within these circles. Almost 
invariably the homes will be thick about the base of the 
institution, thinning out with distance. This marked 
tendency is equally strong in all sections of the country. 
1For example, in the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, etc.

Figure 16, for example, takes at random four represen- 
tative colleges in the North Atlantic region. From a 
semicircle—the other half of the circle falls in the At- 
lantic Ocean—with a radius of fifty miles, Bowdoin draws 
48 per cent. of its regular undergraduate body; from 
little more than a semicircle, with a radius of one hun- 
dred miles, it draws 65 per cent. Union, Swarthmore and 
Rochester obtain respectively 48 per cent., 64 per cent., 
and 87 per cent. from within fifty miles; 61 per cent., 79 
per cent., and 93 per cent. from within one hundred miles. 
In the case of Rochester, nearly one half the circle is cut 
off by Lake Ontario, but the local percentage is raised by 
the inclusion of women students, who necessarily come 
from Rochester only, since there are no dormitories for 
the accommodation of those from a distance. 
In the South Atlantic section, three institutions 
(Figure 17), similarly chosen, sustain, on the whole, the 
same principle. One half the students of Richmond 
College live fifty miles or less from the college; a trifle 
less than three fourths, one hundred miles or less. Fur- 
man University derives 60 per cent. of its students from 
the smaller area, 72 per cent. from the greater. Trinity 
College, getting only 35 per cent. of its students from 
within fifty miles and 61 per cent. from within one hundred 
miles, is a partial exception, only because the State Uni- 
versity and Wake Forest College, being so near by, drain 
the same area.

conform to the same rule, with 48 per cent., 45 per cent., 
and 49 per cent., respectively, of their students coming 
less than fifty miles, and 54 per cent., 68 per cent., and 80 
per cent. coming one hundred miles or less. Baylor 
University, located in the centre of an immense and 
thinly settled country, might be expected to draw less 
heavily on its immediate environment; yet 56 per cent. 
of its students reside within the one hundred mile circle. 
The North Central section illustrates the same ten- 
dency. Beloit and Grinnell Colleges and Baker Univer- 
sity (Figure 19) draw approximately one half their regular 
undergraduate body from the smaller of the two circles 
we are considering, and from two thirds to three fourths 
of them from the larger. Marietta, by reason probably 
of its close proximity to important West Virginia towns, 
draws over three fourths from the fifty mile area, and 
almost nine tenths from the one hundred mile area. 
The extreme West is no exception. Whitman and 
Colorado Colleges (Figure 20) agree in obtaining 44 per 
cent. within the fifty mile radius; the former obtains 50 
percent., the latter 62 per cent., within one hundred miles, 
Pomona College, despite the fact that a considerable 
slice is cut off the circle by the Pacific Ocean, obtains 
most of its students (80 per cent.) from its immediate 
vicinity; less than 15 per cent. travel over one hundred 
miles. This extraordinarily high percentage is perhaps 
due to the fact that many families settle close to the 
college so as thus to obtain both climatic and educational 
advantages.

The importance of an institution, the need for its 
development, can therefore—other things being equal 
—be gauged by the possibilities of its immediate 
environment. Of what sort of field is it the centre? Is 
there promise of growth in population and wealth? These 
are the first questions to be put in attempting to define 
the present and future value of an institution “in a com- 
prehensive system of higher education.”’ They are not, of 
course, the only questions; under certain circumstances 
they may not be the most important questions. As the 
Board’s influence tends to assist in reshaping conditions 
that have come about for historical and other reasons, 
simple schematic procedure is impossible; but it remains 
true, none the less, that location in a promising environ- 
ment constitutes strong initial presumption of usefulness, 
while location in an unpromising environment is apt to 
prove a serious handicap. 
Even a few miles may make a profound difference. A 
city is a more hopeful site than an adjoining suburb. 
Northwestern University at Evanston and Lake Forest 
College at Lake Forest, Ill., are both on the outskirts 
of Chicago; valuable as their work has been, they have 
not drawn large numbers of undergraduate students from 
the city of Chicago. The University of Chicago was 
located in the city, and has rapidly enrolled a numerous 
undergraduate body. Western Reserve College, removed 
from Hudson to Cleveland, has developed notably in 
size and strength. 
Exceptions, of course, at once leap to mind: Dartmouth,

Williams, Amherst, and others. These institutions, es- 
tablished before the growth of great cities with the in- 
dustrial and social changes implied therein, had already 
acquired sufficient momentum to defy the tendency under 
discussion. They have strong support in a numerous, 
prosperous body of alumni, and rich historical, local, and 
personal associations, making their future alike useful and 
secure. Nevertheless, it is important not to magnify the 
extent to which even they are exceptions to the general 
tule. None of them are really national in scope. While 
Amherst College, for example (Figures 21, 22), draws 
less than one fifth of its students from the fifty mile 
circle, over 40 per cent. come from the one hundred mile 
circle, and 92 per cent. from the region east of the Missis- 
sippi and north of the Ohio. The reach of Williams 
College (Figures 23, 24) is somewhat larger: only 14 per 
cent. come from the smaller area, only 23 per cent. from 
the larger; but 94 per cent. live east of the Mississippi 
and north of the Ohio. Of the regular undergraduate 
body of Harvard College (Figure 25) 57 per cent. come 
from three fourths of a circle with a radius of fifty miles; 
6r per cent. from somewhat less than a semicircle having 
a radius of one hundred miles. The comparatively small 
size of New Haven reduces Yale’s draft (Figure 26) on 
the fifty mile area to 23 per cent.; but 47 per cent. live 
within one hundred miles. 
The colleges for women belong to this category. The 
first foundations of this kind obtained relatively wide 
fame as innovations and naturally drew ambitious girls

from all sections. Moreover, these institutions have 
never been so numerous that the demand for higher edu- 
cation on the part of women could be as a rule locally 
satisfied. Nevertheless, the one hundred mile limit 
takes in a substantial portion of the attendance and only 
a small percentage come from remote regions. Smith 
College, for instance (Figures 27, 28), draws 14 and 35 per 
cent, respectively, from fifty and one hundred miles, 86 
per cent. from the larger field east of the Mississippi and 
north of the Ohio. Vassar (Figures 29, 30), drawing 9 per 
cent. from the fifty mile limit, 42 per cent. from one hun- 
dred miles, and 86 per cent. from the territory east of the 
Mississippi and north of the Ohio, is similar to Smith. 
It is clear then that the geographical factor is always 
powerful, even though not infrequently offset to greater 
or less extent by historical or other considerations. 
Institutions which have thus made themselves effective 
over an unusually wide territory are obviously to be re- 
garded as permanent and important factors in our 
educational development, precisely as in Germany the 
universities of Tiibingen and Greifswald have more than 
triumphed over a disadvantageous location. Never- 
theless, such institutions constitute no conclusive prec- 
edent for present-day action. Our college planning, in 
so far as it endeavors to develop institutions that have 
not yet attained full power, must give great weight to the 
consideration that the modern university thrives and is 
most useful in close association with population, industry, 
and wealth.

136 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
We shall see in a moment that this is a fact, vouched 
for by experience, even were it a matter to be deplored. 
But it is by no means clear that a rural location has to-day 
any substantial advantages at all over an urban location. 
The village or the wilderness was suitable to the college 
student, from twelve to fourteen years of age at matricu- 
lation and hardly more than sixteen at graduation, whose 
instruction was confined to ancient languages, the ele- 
ments of mathematics, rhetoric, and philosophy. To- 
day the college student is on the verge of manhood; the 
college curriculum endeavors to include not only the 
treasures of historic culture, but the activities and ideals 
of contemporary life. From these points of view, the 
opportunities, influences, perhaps even the restraints, 
surrounding the student in a city of fifty or one hundred 
thousand inhabitants may well be superior to the influ- 
ences in the country college situated in a little village 
which the students dominate. 
LARGE DEVELOPMENT OF COLLEGES LOCATED IN CITIES 
Of the hundreds of colleges and universities struggling 
for existence at the time the General Education Board 
was established, thirty-four, privately founded, had en- 
dowments valued at $500,000 or more. Of these thirty- 
four, twenty-three were located in cities and growing 
towns. The eleven situated less favorably had $13,000,000 
in endowment, and less than 6,000 students; the twenty- 
three more favorably situated had $72,000,000 of endow- 
ment, and almost 36,000 students.

Moved, therefore, by the foregoing facts and consider- 
ations, the General Education Board has by preference 
selected for assistance institutions situated within a field 
where students could be easily procured, where the foster- 
ing care of a prosperous community could be counted on, 
where an appetite for knowledge and culture could be 
readily stimulated and gratified. At the same time it 
has not passed by older institutions, otherwise located. 
(6) Denominational Institutions 
A second factor of immense importance, particularly 
in the early days of development, is the relationship of 
the college to a religious denomination. It has been al- 
ready pointed out that religious bodies have very un- 
wisely over-multiplied colleges, thus scattering students 
and resources. But, on the other hand, they are en- 
titled to the credit of having founded and maintained 
most of our really substantial private foundations. 
Their loyalty has as a rule not ceased even where the 
denominational relationship no longer holds. Yale, 
founded and long controlled by Congregationalists, is 
still their pride, even though in scope and ideal it has 
little in common with the small college established to 
provide an educated ministry for the denomination; 
Princeton owes as much to Presbyterianism; Brown to 
the Baptists. Of the newer colleges and universities 
out of which the future Harvards, Yales, Princetons, 
and Browns must come, most of them are of denomi- 
national origin, and most are still the objects of denomi-

national care. An effort to develop a system of higher 
education in the United States requires, therefore, con- 
stant and sympathetic coéperation with denominational 
organizations; only thus can certain promising institu- 
tions be aided; only thus can a movement toward con- 
centration of denominational effort be promoted. 
(c) Importance of Increasing Endowments 
It was tentatively estimated that an efficient college 
should enjoy an income from endowment covering from 
40 to 60 per cent. of its annual expenditure. Moreover, 
the expense of conducting colleges and universities is 
bound to increase with the cost of living, the competition 
for trained teachers, the enlargement of the boundaries 
of knowledge, and the increase of specialization. In order 
that they may obtain and retain competent teachers, 
the colleges must be financially strong and secure. Sup- 
port by fees and by contributions to meet current ex- 
pense is too precarious to sustain the elaborate organi- 
zation of a modern institution of learning. It was de- 
cided, therefore, that the gifts of the General Education 
Board should be made to endowment and on such terms 
as were calculated to draw further funds to the selected 
institutions and arouse other interests in them. There 
was the further consideration that buildings, grounds, ap- 
paratus, and scholarships can all be more readily obtained 
through gifts than can the endowment necessary to meet 
the expenditure they entail. 
The three main features of the policy of the General
-P-A-G-E-179
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 143. 
Education Board in dealing with higher education may 
therefore be expressed as follows: 
(z) Preference for centres of wealth and population as 
the pivots of the system; 
(2) Systematic and helpful codperation with religious 
denominations; 
(3) Concentration of gifts in the form of endowment. 
APPROPRIATIONS TO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
Up to June 30, 1914, the General Education Board made 
contributions to 103 colleges and universities; to nineteen 
of these it has made a second appropriation. The sums 
pledged by the Board amount to $10,582,591.80; the 
institutions assisted have themselves undertaken to 
raise additional sums aggregating almost $40,000,000. 
Through the codperation of the General Education Board, 
therefore, $50,000,000 will shortly have been added to 
college and university resources. Nor does this sum 
represent the full outcome of the Board’s work in this 
direction, for it does not include bequests written into 
the wills of those whose interest in a particular institu- 
tion was first aroused or much deepened by campaigns 
undertaken to increase endowment. The Board has’ 
been assured that very considerable sums have thus 
been obtained. A recent report received from institu- 
tions which have been assisted discloses the fact that the 
total increase in the endowment of colleges to which the 
Board has made pledges, determined as from the dates of 
the several pledges, is already $20,760,292. The total
-P-A-G-E-180
144 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
cost of new buildings for the same period is $6,302,953. 
A list of the institutions with the sums raised is given 
below.! The following map (Figure 31) shows the geo- 
graphical distribution of the institutions to which appro- 
priations have been made. 
It will have been remarked that the gifts of the Gen- 
eral Education Board to colleges and universities are 
invariably part only of the sum which the institutions 
in question have undertaken to raise. It should, however, 
be stated that this does not mean that the General Edu- 
cation Board requires an institution to raise any par- 
ticular sum or to raise money in any particular way. 
Quite the contrary is the case. Not the Board, but the 
institution, takes the initiative, by communicating to the 
Board its intention to undertake the raising of a certain 
sum, toward which a contribution is requested from the 
General Education Board. In giving, the Board is 
therefore in the same position as every other contribu- 
tor; all alike subscribe specified sums toward a speci- 
fied total; all are therefore conditional givers. The 
General Education Board appears to stand out from 
the others, not because its offer is any more conditional, 
but simply because it is usually the largest single con- 
tributor. 
Conditional giving is justified by its fruits. Let us 
tecall for a moment what has been previously stated in 
respect to the founding and support of higher institutions 
of learning in the United States. They derive their

146 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
funds largely from private donors; in so far, their secur- 
ity and growth depend on their possessing a wide circle 
of devoted friends. Moreover, the sudden increase in 
the cost of conducting higher education, due to the quick 
development of laboratories, research, libraries, etc., 
required that this circle of devoted friends be very rapidly 
enlarged. More persons had to be interested on short 
notice, and they had to be trained at once to give more 
generously. Modest unconditioned gifts might indeed 
prove a hindrance rather than a help. A new building 
presented without an increase of endowment sufficient 
to carry the additional expense incurred in running it; 
an endowed professorship unaccompanied by increased 
general funds; a new campus without further unencum- 
bered funds with which to develop and care for it— these 
and other unconditioned benefactions tend to embarrass, 
not to assist, a university. Conditional giving means, 
therefore, that when an institution undertakes to raise 
money for expansion, it has calculated what it needs in 
order, not only to make, but to support, a progressive 
step. To this end every giver increases the leverage 
by means of which the required total may be collected; 
every giver accepts a certain—not infrequently a large— 
responsibility for the future of the institution. It may 
not be amiss to add in this connection that, in founding 
the University of Chicago, Mr. Rockefeller acted upon 
the principle just elucidated. In making his final gift 
of $10,000,000 to this institution (December 13, 1910) he 
stated his conviction that “it is far better that the uni-
-P-A-G-E-183
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 147 
versity be supported and enlarged by the gifts of many 
than by those of a single donor. I have accordingly 
sought to assist you in enlisting the interest and securing 
the contributions of many others.” 
It happens, of course, very often that the General 
Education Board is unable to see its way clear to making 
contributions that have been requested. It is believed 
that adverse decisions of this kind have as a rule been 
satisfactorily explained to the applicants, so that, even 
if the reasons may not be concurred in, the disinterested 
desire of the Board to do justice has not been questioned. 
Decisions of this kind may be based on one or more of 
several reasons: the Board may have already contributed 
more than a fair share to the section represented; the 
institution may occupy a more or less unpromising sit- 
uation; it may be in too close proximity to a stronger in- 
stitution; it may be without backing; it may be one of 
several denominational institutions which ought to be 
merged rather than separately developed. Some of 
these schools may at the moment be performing a useful 
function; yet unless they appear to be necessary factors 
in a well organized and well distributed permanent sys- 
tem of higher education, the General Education Board is 
compelled to pass them by. 
COLLEGE FINANCE 
As the General Education Board has undertaken to 
render financial assistance, special attention has been 
paid in the study of institutions to their business meth-
-P-A-G-E-184
148 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
ods. As a business organization, alive to the dangers - 
which attend large enterprises, the Board has taken 
care to aid institutions in safeguarding their property. 
The Board was indeed bound to exercise as much care 
in the distribution of its income as in making investment 
of its principal. For this reason, the business manage- 
ment of colleges applying for contributions has been care- 
fully scrutinized with a view to suggesting such improve- 
ments as might be advisable. 
At first, request was made for the report of the treas- 
urer of the college. Sometimes this was sent in printed 
form, but more often, especially by the smaller colleges, 
in manuscript form. A few of these financial statements 
received in the earlier history of the Board were in ex- 
cellent form, and the information desired was easily 
obtained from the official document. More frequently, 
however, the statement was incomplete and confused. 
The essential facts about which information was wanted 
could not be gathered from the report. Furthermore, 
there was no uniformity of statement among the many 
colleges reporting, so that comparative presentation of 
facts regarding several colleges was impossible. The 
varied systems of accounting employed rendered it 
practically impossible to secure a correct comparative 
statement of any item of college finance. It became 
necessary, therefore, to prepare a set of questions and 
to ask the colleges applying for aid to cast their accounts 
in forms provided by the office of the General Education 
Board. These forms provided for sharp distinction in   
     
-P-A-G-E-185
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 149 
matters that were essentially different, and defined terms 
so as to leave no doubt in the mind of any one as to their 
précise meaning. These blanks were sent freely to all who 
asked for them, and they have contributed toward re- 
shaping the financial methods of many institutions. It 
may be interesting, as a matter of record, to mention some 
of the particulars wherein the Board has been helpful to 
colleges in improving the management of their finances. 
IMPROVEMENTS SECURED 
(a) More Careful Accounting 
The call for accurate and complete financial statistics 
has resulted in the more careful keeping of records. 
Originally, many, particularly the smaller, colleges had 
no organized bookkeeping staff. One college was dis- 
covered which had no record of bonds given for endow- 
ment, except the envelope in which they were placed. 
In another instance gifts had been received through a 
series of years and no record of the amounts or the pur- 
poses for which the gifts were made had been kept. The 
only thing known by the college when the inquiry was 
made was that at that time they had such and such secur- 
ities. Colleges have found it necessary to examine files 
of years’ accumulation, to search records of church or- 
ganizations, to appeal to the memory of ‘‘the oldest in- 
habitant” and to resort to every known method of getting 
information, and then have been obliged to report that the 
statements submitted were only approximately correct. 
All this is beingchanged. Bookkeepers are being installed;
-P-A-G-E-186
150 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
a thoroughgoing system of bookkeeping established; a 
complete system of vouchers adopted; an annual auditing 
of accounts required by the trustees, as well as the issuing 
of financial reports to boards of trustees and to others. 
(b) Definition of Terms 
A few words have found their way into college finance 
which have been freely used without clear or definite 
meaning. To one, they have meant this, to another, 
that. Among them are the following: ‘‘equipment,” 
“scientific equipment,” “capital,” ‘‘endowment,” ‘“in- 
come,” ‘investments.’ Early in the history of the 
Board it became clear that before accurate statements, 
particularly comparative statements, could be made, 
words must be defined. For example, what is ‘‘en- 
dowment?”’ Reports made to other agencies than the 
General Education Board showed that all sorts of prop- 
erty were being reported as ‘‘endowment,” the word 
being so freely and loosely used by colleges in reporting 
that published statistics were valueless. So indiscrimi- 
nate were the returns under this heading that summaries 
made on the basis of these reports frequently included 
the same item twice and sometimes actually included 
liabilities. ‘‘Investments” has been as loosely used. 
Not infrequently subscription notes and even verbal 
promises to make gifts have been reported as ‘‘invest- 
ment” or “endowment.” One college officer astonished 
the office by making a report which was very flattering, 
and when questioned more closely confessed that the
-P-A-G-E-187
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES I5r 
amount reported was what “he hoped to have!” A 
persistent attempt has been made by the officers in 
charge to define terms and to secure the use of terms in 
their exact meaning so that, for example, when the word 
“endowment”’ was used it would not be interpreted to 
mean college buildings, or subscription notes of doubtful 
value, or good-will on the part of some one who might or 
might not remember the institution in his will. A 
sharp distinction has been insisted on as between capital 
and current funds. Colleges have been found which 
were in the field collecting funds ostensibly for endow- 
ment or for building purposes, when, as a matter of fact, 
all receipts were poured into one account from which 
current expenses were being met without discrimination 
as to the source of supply. 
(c) Endowment Funds to Be Kept Intact 
All colleges with which the Board has coéperated have 
already been in possession of trust funds. But it has 
been discovered that not infrequently such trust funds 
have been depleted. The Board of Trustees of a college, 
being hard pressed to meet current expenses, has re- 
sorted to the fiction of “borrowing” from permanent 
funds to tide the college over a time of stress; occasionally 
a “note” is given to cover the “‘loan.” The relief may 
not have come as anticipated and the ‘‘ borrowed” money 
frequently has not been returned to the trust fund. 
Whenever this state of affairs has been found, the General 
Education Board has insisted upon the restoration of such
-P-A-G-E-188
152 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
trust funds before making payments on its pledge. Ithas 
also stipulated that the money contributed by the General 
Education Board “shall be invested and preserved in- 
violably for the endowment” of the institution. The 
Board has received many assurances from colleges that in 
the future trust funds will be more strictly regarded and 
that under no circumstances will encroachment upon per- 
manent funds to meet current expenses be allowed. The 
Board has thus been made to believe that, apart from 
rendering direct aid to colleges, it has been of service in 
throwing safeguards about funds contributed by others. 
(d) Educational and Business Budgets 
A distinction has been made between an educational 
budget and affairs of a business or a semi-business nature 
conducted in connection with a college. Certain colleges, 
particularly colleges for women, maintain boarding de- 
partments, for example. Early records show that it has 
been customary for many colleges to include gross re- 
ceipts from the boarding department as “‘college re- 
ceipts.”’ This custom not only made comparison of these 
colleges impracticable with colleges reporting no such 
gross receipts, but it rendered impossible the making of a 
strictly educational budget. In the blank forms above 
referred to, which have been furnished to colleges making 
reports to the office of the General Education Board, 
provision is made for the segregation of all accounts of a 
business or semi-business nature, thus permitting a clear 
statement of annual receipts and expenditures for educa-
-P-A-G-E-189
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 153 
tional purposes. College officials have reported to the 
office that this insistence upon segregation of strictly 
educational matters from business affairs has been help- 
ful, not only in preparing the educational budget, but also 
in determining the profit or loss of the business conducted. 
(e) Differentiation of Departments 
As the General Education Board has been devoting 
its attention to the development of a limited number of 
colleges of the arts and sciences, its officers have sought 
to learn the facts specifically regarding the college depart- 
ment of the institution. In the earlier dealings of the 
Board with colleges it found few institutions maintaining 
preparatory departments which knew the comparative ex- 
pense of the collegiate and preparatory departments. The 
accounts were inextricably mixed. A radical change has 
been made in the method of accounting so that now all 
the better institutions are able to determine the exact 
financial status of their several departments. The ten- 
dency has been not only to draw a clear line of demarca- 
tion between the finances of the college and the academy, 
but to separate the two parts educationally or to dis- 
continue the secondary work altogether. The very word 
“college” has come to have a new meaning in consequence 
of a better system of accounting. 
EFFECT OF BOARD’S CONTRIBUTIONS 
Many years must necessarily elapse before the main 
task in which the General Education Board is assisting
-P-A-G-E-190
154 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
can be even approximately completed. Meanwhile, 
there can be no doubt in the mind of any one familiar 
with the facts that the growing recognition of the im- 
portance of conceiving the higher education of the coun- 
try, from the standpoint of a system of parts mutually 
related by the voluntary efforts of those interested, is 
proof of the soundness of the conception which led to the 
creation of the Board. Nor has the activity of the Board 
cost institutions anything in the way of freedom to meet 
their own problems in their own way. On this point 
expressions are too many and too sincere to leave any 
doubt whatsoever. The very opposite, indeed, has hap- 
pened. The gifts of the General Education Board have 
been the means of arousing new effort. ‘‘The offer of the 
General Education Board proved to be the culmination 
of a series of events which caused the friends of the col- 
lege to rally to the institution in a campaign for addi- 
tional endowment as nothing else could have done,” 
writes the president of one institution. ‘Under the 
stimulus of your pledge,” wrote another, “‘a local move- 
ment was begun, local resources were developed, alumni 
and friends were aroused, and we secured not only a 
million dollars, but twenty-five hundred investors in our 
educational enterprise, many of whom had never before 
contributed to the support of an American university.” 
In one instance, the only endowed college in a Southern 
state, “struggling against almost insuperable obstacles,” 
was saved from destruction and has now $300,000 safely 
invested; in another—this one of the strongest institu-
-P-A-G-E-191
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 155 
tions of the land—the Board’s appropriation was the 
initial help in obtaining land, buildings, and endowment 
for a set of adequate university laboratories. In repeated 
instances, debts have been paid, salaries increased, new 
departments created, and more teachers supplied in con- 
sequence of the increased resources toward which the 
Board’s gifts served as an almost indispensable leverage. 
An institution’s usefulness grows with its financial 
strength. The canvass for funds itself attracts students 
by making it better known; increased resources mean 
larger and more varied facilities, through which, of 
course, more students are more efficiently trained. The 
rapid increase in university attendance has iorced the 
raising of larger sums; the raising of these sums has re- 
acted on and increased attendance. If colleges and uni- 
versities are to be thus popularly fostered and sustained, 
the work of the General Education Board may be fairly 
said to have made these institutions the more secure to 
the extent that it has increased the number of those who 
have a stake in them.

VI. MEDICAL EDUCATION 
HE activities described in the preceding section 
[ have been concerned only with what is ordi- 
narily known as the department or faculty of arts 
and sciences—the core of the American college or uni- 
versity. For some years the Board concentrated its 
attention on this central feature of our institutions of 
higher learning. Only within the last year has it under- 
taken to deal with one of the professional schools, viz., 
that of medicine. 
DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IN AMERICA 
The American medical school began as a casual asso- 
ciation of local physicians lecturing and occasionally 
demonstrating to a nondescript body of medical students. 
Up to comparatively recent times the facilities were 
of the most meagre kind. Laboratories of very un- 
satisfactory character were provided for anatomy, chem- 
istry, and perhaps pathology; clinical opportunities were 
limited to a precarious relationship with a private or 
public hospital, the appointments to which were made 
on almost any basis except education and science. The 
curriculum, originally calling for the repetition of certain 
courses of lectures during two successive years was only 
160
-P-A-G-E-197
MEDICAL EDUCATION 161 
gradually and painfully lengthened and graded. En- 
trance requirements there were for years none worthy 
the name. The fees received for the opportunities just 
described were distributed among those participating 
in the instruction. 7 
CHANGES IN RECENT YEARS 
During the last twenty-five years these so-called pro- 
prietary schools have come to be regarded with great 
disfavor. Many have closed their doors; signs of dis- 
comfort preceding dissolution can be discerned in those 
still surviving. These schools were most numerous 
about the year 1906 when 161 medical schools were in 
existence in the United States; now, less than a decade 
later, this number has decreased to about a hundred. 
The process of reduction has obviously still far to go; but 
the accomplishment in this direction has undoubtedly 
been noteworthy. Simultaneously, the surviving schools 
have greatly improved. Entrance requirements have 
been formulated and somewhat rapidly elevated—in 
the South, especially, with such excessive speed that 
the better medical schools have for the time being lost 
touch with the general educational situation. Tuition 
fees, instead of going into the pockets of practitioner 
teachers, have been utilized to equip the necessary 
fundamental laboratories, and to pay for a gradually 
increasing number of full-time teachers; the hospital 
relationship has been improved to the extent that larger 
freedom for teaching has been obtained, though the hos-
-P-A-G-E-198
162 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
pital staff continues, in so far as these schools are con- 
cerned, to be appointed largely for other than educational 
reasons. 
THE NEW TYPE OF MEDICAL SCHOOL 
The progress just sketched has been greatly influenced 
by the outright creation, meanwhile, of a new type of 
medical school—a school offering from the start, to 
properly qualified students, a four years’ graded 
course, the first two years devoted to laboratory subjects 
—anatomy, physiology, and pathology; the last two 
years devoted to clinical subjects—medicine, surgery, 
obstetrics, etc.—all these departments being organized 
and equipped with education and science prominently 
in mind. The first and best known of these modern 
institutions was the Medical School of the Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore. This institution, fortunate 
in its freedom from all entanglements, in its posses- 
sion of an excellent endowed hospital, and above all in 
wise and devoted leadership, set a new and stimulating 
example precisely when a demonstration of the right 
type was most urgently needed. 
THE LABORATORY BRANCHES 
At the time of the establishment of the Johns Hopkins 
Medical School in 1893, the fundamental laboratory 
branches—anatomy, physiology, and pathology—were 
still taught in even the better medical schools then exist- 
ing by practising physicians. It is true that at Harvard
-P-A-G-E-199
MEDICAL EDUCATION 163 
the important fundamental subjects were already taught 
by full-time men; and in one or two other institutions 
an occasional full-time teacher was to be found. But, 
generally speaking, these instances were sporadic. The 
subjects were in consequence, as a rule, ill taught and 
poorly developed; for the main interest of most teachers 
and their assistants was in their private practice and they 
could give to teaching only such time and energy as 
practice did not absorb. In the new Johns Hopkins 
School the laboratory sciences were from the first placed 
upon an unconditioned university basis. They were 
cultivated by “full-time” teachers working under uni- 
versity conditions and working for university rewards, 
such rewards being modest material, and abundant 
spiritual, satisfactions. In the organization of its labora- 
tory departments, the Johns Hopkins Medical School rec- 
ognized the contrast between an academic and a worldly 
career. The academic career must not indeed defeat its 
own object by requiring such renunciations as cramp and 
thwart development; but it can never hope to rival the 
worldly career on thelatter’sownground. It will not yield 
abundant material satisfactions; it cannot, as a rule, live 
with them. The laboratory staff was accordingly com- 
posed of men of modest income leading academic lives 
devoted to teaching and research. It is no exaggeration 
to say that the few teachers who manned these depart- 
ments and worked in this spirit revolutionized within a 
single decade the status of anatomy, physiology, and 
pathology in America. Their pupils were soon sought as
-P-A-G-E-200
164 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
teachers by other schools; nowadays no reputable medi- 
cal school uses practitioners to teach these branches. 
Moreover, the work of these men in America and of their 
collaborators in other countries has provided a new 
basis for medical and surgical development. 
THE CLINICAL BRANCHES 
On the clinical side, the establishment of the Johns 
Hopkins Medical School was marked by two important 
features. The first of these was its organic connection 
with its own hospital. At that time, though one or two 
medical schools possessed small university hospitals— 
hospitals, that is, the staff of which the school selected— 
no such medical school possessed a hospital adequate in 
size and equipment for such teaching and research as 
should be prosecuted. For the most part, as has been 
already stated, hospital relationship to medical schools 
was casual or precarious. Hospital trustees appointed a 
medical and surgical staff; and schools desiring hospital 
facilities had to employ these men as teachers or do with- 
out. In no case did a hospital sufficient in size, well 
supported, and well equipped for teaching and investiga- 
tion belong to an American medical school prior to the 
establishment of the Johns Hopkins Medical School. 
The second feature above alluded to was the selection 
of clinical teachers on scientific grounds. The founders 
of the Johns Hopkins broke with precedent when, instead 
of filling the clinical teaching posts with local practi- 
tioners, as had been and still unfortunately is the pre-
-P-A-G-E-201
MEDICAL EDUCATION 165 
vailing custom, the clinical professors were called from 
other places: Philadelphia, New York, and elsewhere. 
In this way as capable a staff as the country afforded was 
assembled, and as selections could be and were made on 
educational and scientific grounds, the country for the 
first time saw an entire medical school organized on pre- 
cisely the same principles that obtained in other uni- 
versity departments. 
Unfortunately, the university lacked income enough to 
pay its clinical teachers adequately, even had it desired 
todoso. They had to engage in practice. To greater or 
less extent clinical teaching and clinical research have 
therefore suffered from the distractions incident to the 
life of practitioner and consultant. This could not be 
otherwise. Clinical teaching is not easier than labora- 
tory teaching: it is more difficult; clinical research is not 
easier than laboratory research: it is more complicated. 
To conditions essential for research and teaching in 
anatomy and physiology, medicine and surgery cannot 
be indifferent. Under existing circumstances, initial suc- 
cess in clinical investigation may easily prove the clini- 
cian’s permanent undoing. Scientific distinction brings 
hordes of patients, especially the rich; and this even 
though, as a matter of fact, in many instances, equally 
skilful service can be had elsewhere. In any event so- 
ciety has other uses for the clinical investigator. For to 
him the country must look altogether for the training of 
physicians and very largely for the increase of knowledge. 
It is necessary, therefore, that obscure cases should en-
-P-A-G-E-202
166 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
gage his attention, and important that he should not ex- 
pend himself on things that others can do satisfactorily. 
In Germany the general university tradition, the practice 
of basing academic distinction and promotion on scien- 
tific performance, has in the past served to protect clini- 
cal professors from distraction; nevertheless, in German 
universities situated in large cities, very disquieting in- 
dications of demoralization due to the invasion of worldly 
ambitions can nowadays be perceived. The American 
teacher of clinical medicine wholly lacks this bulwark; 
and though here and there an individual has successfully 
maintained his ideals against the pressure of private 
practice, the university type of clinician is extremely rare. 
It has therefore become important to create conditions 
favorable to the evolution of the full-time university 
clinician. 
“PULL-TIME” CLINICAL TEACHERS 
Fully cognizant of the situation just described, the 
faculty of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, after de- 
voting several years to careful consideration of the best 
way in which to improve clinical conditions, from the 
three essential points of view—care of patients, teaching, 
and research—recommended that the main clinical de- 
partments—medicine, surgery, and pediatrics—should be 
organized on the full-time or university basis, if the 
necessary endowment could be obtained. A letter setting 
forth the facts was addressed to the General Education 
Board, October 21, 1913. ‘‘The faculty of the Medical
-P-A-G-E-203
MEDICAL EDUCATION 167 
School”—so ran the communication—‘“are fully con- 
vinced of the wisdom and necessity of commanding the 
entire time and devotion of a staff of teachers in the main 
clinical branches, precisely as the school has since its 
beginning commanded the entire time and devotion of 
the teachers of the underlying sciences; we are persuaded 
that the time is ripe for the step in question and we are 
desirous of undertaking the innovation. Should the 
General Education Board provide the funds, the depart- 
ments of medicine, surgery, and pediatrics would be or- 
ganized on the full-time basis—that is, the professor and 
his staff consisting of associate professors, associates, 
assistants, etc.—would hold their posts on the condition 
that while engaged in the service of the university and 
hospital they accept no fees for professional services. 
They would be free to render any service required by 
humanity or science, but from it they would be expected 
to derive no pecuniary benefit. Fees charged by the hos- 
pital for professional services to private patients, whether 
within or without the hospital, by members of the full- 
time staff, such as at present are paid directly to the 
physician, would be used to promote the objects for the 
attainment of which this request is made.” 
THE WILLIAM H. WELCH ENDOWMENT 
It was calculated that an endowment approximating 
$1,500,000 would be necessary for the purpose above 
mentioned, and this sum the General Education Board 
appropriated. In consideration of his unique services
-P-A-G-E-204
168 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
to medical science and medical education, the fund was 
named the William H. Welch Endowment for Clinical 
Education and Research; for Dr. Welch had planned the 
Johns Hopkins Medical School, had selected its faculty, 
had guided its development, and has throughout his 
life been the wise, forceful, and modest leader of modern 
medicine and modern medical education in America. 
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL SCHOOL 
The Board is also coéperating with Washington Uni- 
versity, St. Louis, to the same end. The medical depart- 
ment of this institution had been of the usual local type; 
but far-reaching changes have been recently made. 
‘‘Within the last three years,” in the words of the appli- 
cation addressed to the General Education Board, ‘the 
Medical Department of Washington University has been 
completely reorganized as follows: The entire faculty 
resigned and successors, chosen on the advice of the 
leading medical scientists, were called from different 
institutions—the pathologist from the Rockefeller In- 
stitute, the physiologist from the University of Wiscon- 
sin, the biological chemist from Cornell University, the 
chief physician from Tulane University, the chief surgeon 
from the Massachusetts General Hospital. At the same 
time the university entered into contracts with the trus- 
tees of the Barnes Hospital and of the Children’s Hospital 
according to which the three parties in interest decided 
to build a single plant, including a general hospital, a 
children’s hospital, out-patient department, and univer-
-P-A-G-E-205
MEDICAL EDUCATION 169 
sity laboratories, on a new site of which all three parties 
are owners.’ The group of buildings in question is now 
nearing completion. They are of modern design and 
equipment, amply furnished with every appliance needed 
for treatment, education, and research. The hospitals will 
be opened in the summer of 1914; the medical school will 
hold its next session in the new quarters. In addition to 
highly advantageous contracts giving the university ex- 
clusive and complete teaching privileges in and medical 
and surgical control of the hospitals, and in addition to 
the powerful community of interest which these relations 
create, the plant is physically so unified that it would be 
practically impossible ever to separate it into its con- 
stituent parts. 
“The plant above described has cost something over 
two and one half millions; the Barnes Hospital has an 
endowment of about one million dollars, which the uni- 
versity expects to supplement by annual subscriptions, 
and by raising a university hospital fund of like amount. 
1The arrangement between Washington University and the Barnes 
Hospital is important because it shows how a medical school and a hos- 
pital with entirely distinct endowments and control may coéperate in 
caring for the sick, in teaching and research, to the immense benefit of 
all parties in interest. As it is hardly likely that the same individual 
will found hospital and university (as Johns Hopkins fortunately did), 
the type of relationship worked out in St. Louis is of great importance. 
For this reason, the contract between the two institutions is printed in 
full in the Appendix, pp. 224-230. A similar contract has also been made 
between Washington University and the St. Louis Children’s Hospital, 
by which the Medical School obtains complete control of a modern chil- 
dren’s hospital for its department of pediatrics. Washington University 
has also contracted with both the above named hospitals to operate a 
Training School for Nurses, supplying both institutions with nurses and 
charging each its proper proportion of the expense incurred. The con- 
tract dealing with this service is printed on pp. 230-1.
-P-A-G-E-206
170 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
The Children’s Hospital has fixed annual subscriptions of 
forty thousand dollars. 
“Tt is estimated that an endowment producing fifty 
thousand dollars more would suffice to provide a full- 
time organization in medicine and surgery. 
“Tn case the full-time scheme is introduced, all fees for 
services rendered in the private wards will be assessed by 
the university and collected through the hospital in 
order that in any event only reasonable fees may be 
charged; wherever such services are rendered by any per- 
son on the full-time basis, the fee will be covered into the 
fund which this application seeks to establish, and used 
for the benefit of the clinic concerned. As the private 
ward is a small one, there will be little use for it beyond 
affording the full-time men the opportunity they need 
for observing obscure or interesting patients who would 
not enter the wards. 
“The medical faculty earnestly desires to enter upon 
its new opportunities equipped to take advantage of 
them according to the strictest demands of modern 
science and education. The university has a clean 
slate; and if the necessary aid is obtained, no step will 
be taken which will have to be retraced—no compromise 
effected which will at some future time have to be un- 
done.” rf 
In compliance with the foregoing request, the Board 
appropriated $750,000 toward $1,500,000 for the endow- 
ment of university departments in Medicine, Surgery, 
and Pediatrics.
-P-A-G-E-207
MEDICAL EDUCATION 171 
YALE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT 
More recently, Yale University has undertaken a 
thorough reconstruction of its Medical Department, in 
the course of which the full-time principle will be in- 
troduced into the main clinical departments. The 
school was organized in 1813 and has long been an in- 
tegral part of Yale University. It has, however, lacked 
separate endowment and has, therefore, up to this time, 
had no adequate development, even on the laboratory 
side. Its clinical facilities have consisted in a partial 
and unsatisfactory use of the New Haven Hospital, an 
institution supported partly by income from endowment 
and partly by subscription. Recognizing the fact that 
present conditions were neither creditable nor longer 
tolerable, the Trustees of the Hospital offered to the 
Corporation of Yale University complete medical and 
surgical control of the hospital provided the university 
undertook to furnish adequate laboratories, properly 
manned.! This situation made it possible for Yale to 
develop the type of university medical school which has 
proved so productive and efficient in the smaller uni- 
versity towns of Germany. The university has now set 
out to raise at least $2,000,000; to erect on and adjacent 
to the hospital site modern scientific laboratories; and to 
reorganize the main clinical departments on the full-time 
basis. Toward the sum above named, the General 
Education Board has voted $500,000. 
*This contract which may also serve as a model is printed in the Ap- 
pendix, pp. 231-240. -
-P-A-G-E-208
172 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
The full-time scheme is so recent an innovation that a 
few important points may properly be somewhat fully 
discussed in this connection. 
FREEDOM UNRESTRICTED 
The scheme involves no restriction of experience. In 
the letter of application from the faculty of the Johns 
Hopkins Medical School it was expressly stated that no 
limitation would be placed upon the members of the full- 
time clinical organization. They were not to be kept 
from seeing any patient that they chose to see. They 
can therefore take whatever steps they please to procure 
easy and frequent contact with incipient disturbances; 
they can also attend well-to-do patients afflicted with 
obscure or difficult disease. 
In these matters, the advantage lies altogether with 
the full-time as against the part-time man. In reference, 
for example, to incipient disturbances, the ordinary con- 
sultant is, indeed, the very one whose advice is least apt 
to be invoked in the early stages of a malady. For the 
difficulty of seeing disease in its beginnings, however, a 
remedy, and what may indeed prove a practically com- 
plete remedy, lies at hand for the full-time man. The 
most neglected part of the resources available for clinical 
teaching and research is commonly the outpatient de- 
partment or dispensary. The practitioner or consult- 
ant type of clinical teacher has not the time to develop, 
organize, and utilize the outpatient service. The con- 
nection between the dispensary and the usual indoor
-P-A-G-E-209
MEDICAL EDUCATION 173 
clinic is, therefore, as a rule, nominal. It should be 
close and helpful, for a well-utilized dispensary will feed 
and supplement a well-organized clinic. The full-time 
organization favors such a relation. The instructor and 
his assistants can watch the outpatients for the purpose 
of detecting disorders at the very point of origin. 
Advantage has indeed already been taken of this in Balti- 
more. The favorable comments of the patients them- 
selves on the care and sympathy with which they have 
been handled will rapidly build up the attendance and 
thus increase the reservoir from which usable material 
can be drawn. 
Nor is the university clinician cut off from the well-to- 
do. The scheme seeks only to protect him from those 
who have no claim upon him beyond their ability to pay 
him. Inasmuch, however, as he receives no fee for his 
services, inasmuch as his time and energy are to be de- 
voted, as far as may be, to teaching and research, he 
will have no interest in seeing patients whom others can 
handle as well as he. If well-to-do people come to his 
clinic under proper conditions, they can be received in a 
ward maintained for their reception. For such service 
as is rendered to them, a moderate professional fee will 
be charged; and this fee will be turned into the university 
fund out of which the department is maintained. 
THE PAY WARD 
This arrangement suggests the proper function of the 
pay ward in the university hospital. These hospitals,
-P-A-G-E-210
174 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
like other hospitals, exist to do service. But it does not 
follow that they will do their greatest service by develop- 
ing the largest pay ward that can be skilfully and effi- 
ciently administered. In no event can the pay ward of 
any single hospital undertake to receive more than a 
small fraction of the well-to-do sick. The rest must go 
elsewhere. Perhaps then a smaller pay ward which sets 
a standard will do the largest service for the most people, 
because it serves as a model which other establishments 
may follow. Ifa particular hospital undertook to serve 
larger numbers, it might be tempted to open the door to 
the profession generally or certain members thereof, 
with the result that the organization would be impaired 
and the work suffer. Mere size is therefore not neces- 
sarily imposed on the pay ward, in order to serve a large 
number of pay patients. This is an important consid- 
eration for all hospital administrators. But it has a 
peculiar urgency in case of hospitals associated with 
university medical schools. Their greatest and widest 
service is obviously their contribution to the training 
of successive generations of physicians and to the in- 
crease of knowledge and skill. A large pay ward filled 
with patients afflicted with ailments already well under- 
stood is an obstacle to both research and education; an 
obstacle to research, because it squanders the time of the 
staff; an obstacle to education, because, in addition, it 
lowers the ideals of the entire institution. A pay ward 
is needed, but it should be small—only large enough, in 
fact, to receive for each full-time man a limited number
-P-A-G-E-211
MEDICAL EDUCATION 175 
of selected patients, for whom, in the interest of science, 
education, and humanity, it behooves him to care. 
THE GENERAL PRACTITIONER 
The full-time scheme involves no reflection upon the 
general practitioner. It does not raise the question of 
superiority as between him and the academic clinician. 
They are simply two different persons, discharging differ- 
ent functions. This differentiation of function is re- 
quired by the increased complexity of science and social 
life; concentration and specialization under favorable 
conditions have become—as never before—requisite to 
systematic scientific achievement. As a matter of fact, 
they have always been more or less so. English medi- 
cine has been less continuously productive than German 
medicine, becausein England concentration hasbeen more 
frequently interrupted by professional success. The bril- 
liant achievements of Hunter, Bright, and Simpson had 
worldly consequences that made further performance in- 
creasingly difficult. The genius triumphed, and was 
swept away by the demands of those whose fortunes en- 
abled them to command his time. Concentration has 
therefore been necessary before now; but nevertheless 
the interrelation of recently developed sciences makes it 
more important now than ever before. The full-time 
scheme is the first frank and explicit attempt in medi- 
cine to accept the facts and to build a new structure 
upon them. 
Meanwhile, the practitioner of medicine continues to   
     
-P-A-G-E-212
176 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
discharge important social, professional, and educational 
responsibilities. He has an important practical function 
in translating new knowledge into intelligent therapeutic 
practice; he is also in position to make valuable con- 
tributions to knowledge by observation and experiment. 
Witness the great achievements of James Mackenzie, a 
practising physician in a small English town, whose 
studies mark an epoch in our knowledge of cardiac dis- 
ease. The practitioner will also have a place, more or 
less undefined at this moment, in the university medical 
school. It is, on the one hand, extremely important not 
to overload the full-time staff with routine; it is, on the 
other, important to save to the student whatever is val- 
uable in the practitioner’s experience and point of view. 
The practitioner can therefore be utilized in dispensary 
teaching, to some extent as clinical lecturer or demon- 
strator and perhaps in the handling of various specialties. 
There is no disposition on the part of those who support. 
the full-time plan to deal arbitrarily or dogmatically with 
these questions; they must be solved on the basis of ex- 
perience. Nevertheless, there can be no question that 
the university medical school will more and more get 
its character from the full-time staff. The school faculty 
will ultimately be composed only of full-time men; the 
medical board that controls hospital policy will, in the 
interest of effectiveness, be made up of departmental 
heads devoting themselves singly to the service of the 
university and the hospital. Substantially these steps 
have already been taken in Baltimore; and their success
-P-A-G-E-213
MEDICAL EDUCATION 177 
there will lead to general adoption by schools of equal 
rank. 
POSITIONS ATTRACTIVE 
For the reasons just stated, the full-time posts will be 
occupied by men who desire to be absorbed in teaching 
and research. The three professorships established at the 
Johns Hopkins Medical School have been readily ac- 
cepted at great personal sacrifice by men of conspicuous 
professional standing, all of whom have gladly renounced 
personal pecuniary advantage in order to procure ideal 
conditions for clinical teaching and investigation. A 
similar experience is confidently anticipated by the 
authorities of Washington University and Yale. 
There is no occasion for surprise at this manifestation 
of practical idealism. With all our love of materialistic 
comfort, in no country in the world is there greater 
striving toward altruistic ends, keener or more constant 
» sympathy, more frequent or more heedless sacrifice in 
the interest of science and humanity. The teaching pro- 
fession abounds in men and women moved by nothing 
less than genuinely religious zeal; in every institution 
may be found many such—young, gifted, and devoted. 
An eminent Austrian pharmacologist who recently spent 
a winter in America declared that America was the very 
home of practical idealism. The full-time clinical chair 
appeals to idealistic motive. Medicine has always been 
humanitarian; in this form it becomes increasingly so. 
Not less fascinating than others in point of scientific
-P-A-G-E-214
178 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
interest, the clinical branches are assuredly closer to the 
humanitarian appeal. They would seem therefore bound 
in due course to receive their needed share of recruits on 
the severe terms imposed by academic tradition. If, 
then, clinical progress is stimulated, if men are trained 
willing to devote themselves to science and humanity on 
such terms as obtain in universities, the full-time organi- 
zation will have demonstrated its value and vindicated 
the judgment of those who first enlisted in its service.
-P-A-G-E-215
VII. RURAL EDUCATION 
tion was called to the organizations that have been 
fruitfully busy in arousing educational interest and 
directing educational effort in the Southern states. The 
Conference for Education in the South was, as was there 
pointed out, a more or less informal body, seeking to 
assemble at its annual meetings representatives of every 
phase of social, industrial, and educational interest, for 
the purpose of cultivating friendly intercourse, exchang- 
ing views, and harmonizing policies along broad lines. 
Out of this Conference, as has been previously stated, 
sprang the Southern Education Board, a more definite 
organization intended in the first instance to devote its 
energies to developing public sentiment and to procuring 
favorable action by legislatures and the people on edu- 
cational matters. [: THE opening section of the present volume atten- 
RURAL SCHOOL SUPERVISORS 
Among the more important steps taken by the Southern 
Education Board was the support, in codperation with the 
Peabody Fund, which had previously begun this work, of 
rural school supervisors, charged with the task of super- 
vising the rural schools to which public attention in the

South and indeed throughout the country was then turn- 
ing. On the dissolution of the Peabody Board in 1914, 
the Southern Education Board requested the General 
Education Board to undertake the future maintenance 
and development of this phase of its work. The General 
Education Board thereupon authorized an investigation 
with a view to taking action in reference to the further 
support of these officers whose continuance was eagerly 
desired by the educational authorities of every Southern 
state. 
On some of the significant points developed by this 
objective study of Southern conditions in the spring of 
the current year this volume has already touched, in 
connection with the secondary education movement. 
But the facts are of such importance that a small amount 
of repetition is necessary in order to show their bearing 
on the problem of the rural school. 
IMPORTANCE OF RURAL EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 
The outstanding feature of the Southern situation is its 
predominantly rural character. Despite encroachment 
in the last two decades, due to the growth for the first 
time of some relatively large towns, the rural population 
of the entire region ranges from 70 per cent. in Louisiana 
to 88.5 per cent. in Mississippi; in seven states, the rural 
population is between 70 and 80 per cent. of the whole; in 
six more, between 80 per cent. and go per cent. Clearly 
public education cannot succeed in these states unless 
rural education can be made effective. The Southern
-P-A-G-E-217
RURAL EDUCATION 181 
states must proceed on the assumption that the under- 
taking is feasible; their task is to ascertain how. 
FAVORABLE CONDITIONS 
To Southern faith in education attention has already 
been directed. There are, to be sure, backward districts, 
and great inert masses of population. But there are also 
forward districts, and active centres of enthusiasm and 
endeavor. The Conference for Education in the South 
had contributed to bringing about more solidarity in 
respect to educational endeavor than exists in any other 
section of the country. At times one encounters a fresh- 
ness, vigor, and confidence that recall the Middle West 
and Northwest of twenty years ago; one meets teachers, 
administrators, laymen, aglow with what is to them a new 
discovery. Their spirit is that of the religious mission- 
ary. If the experiment of developing efficient rural 
education must, by the necessities of the case, be at- 
tempted, no more favorable opportunity than the present 
is likely to occur. 
Moreover, the South is relatively prosperous, and is 
willingly devoting steadily increasing funds to school 
purposes. The farm demonstration work, supported 
by the government and the General Education Board, 
and now likely to be greatly extended, will more and more 
create underlying conditions favorable to educational 
development. Abundant statistics showing increasing 
provisions for schools can be readily quoted. The an- 
nual educational expenditures in North Carolina for
-P-A-G-E-218
182 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
public elementary and secondary schools was $1,091,226 
in 1901, $3,069,260 in 1909, $4,300,000 in 1913—that is, 
the annual school fund has quadrupled in twelve years. 
The expenditure of South Carolina in 1901 was $961,897; 
in 1909, $1,590,732; in 1913, $2,609,766; taxes raised by 
voluntary district taxation doubled in the same period. 
Arkansas appropriated $1,369,809 in 1900 and $4,279,478 
in 1913; Tennessee raises altogether $5,000,000 a year for 
educational purposes; toward this sum the state gave last 
year $1,350,000; prior to 1903 it gave practically nothing 
atall. Ofits net state revenue of $6,400,000, Virginia in 
1914 devoted practically one half to education; Alabama 
devoted more than half. Even more hopeful and sig- 
nificant is the fact that, by voluntary community coéper- 
ation, funds are raised to build schoolhouses which are 
presented to the county. In Carolina County, Virginia, a 
thoroughly agricultural and by no means wealthy com- 
munity, four schoolhouses for Negroes and three for 
whites have been lately built and paid for by local sub- 
scription and then donated to the county authorities. 
These instances need not be multiplied. Though the 
totals are not yet sufficiently large, they establish the 
growing ability and willingness of the Southern people 
to spend of their substance for the education of their 
children. UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS 
On the other hand, there are certain conditions, some 
of which have already been touched on, that are for the 
time being distinctly unfavorable to orderly educational
-P-A-G-E-219
RURAL EDUCATION 183 
development. As things now stand, there are still in 
several states serious obstacles to the conception and 
gradual execution of comprehensive plans. The state 
educational organization is in some states more or less 
defective. Few states have instituted really efficient 
methods of raising money; certain of the states have 
in recent years made some genuine improvements; others 
are moving in the same direction; elsewhere, as in Ala- 
bama, for example, local taxation for school purposes 
beyond one mill is unconstitutional. Perhaps nowhere _ 
has an entirely proper relationship between state, county, 
and district officials been worked out. The State 
Superintendent is still in some states a political official. 
In Kentucky and Alabama he may not be reélected; in 
certain other states, more than a second term, even if not 
forbidden, is very improbable. The county superin- 
tendency is as yet too often poorly organized and 
occupied far too frequently by untrained incumbents, 
who in many cases give only part of their time to their 
school duties. Too often the official cannot expect re- 
election. In Kentucky, custom limits the occupant to 
two terms, though exceptions occasionally occur; over 
sixty of the one hundred and twenty counties of the 
state chose new men at the last election. In Alabama 40 
per cent. of the county superintendents are also engaged 
in some other vocation, though of the sixty-eight as- 
sistant superintendents, 57 per cent. are trained teachers. 
Again, the teachers, for the most -part poorly trained, 
are a constantly shifting body. Of the Alabama teach-
-P-A-G-E-220
184 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
ers, 75 per cent. were new to their present places this 
year. In twelve Mississippi counties, a recent study 
shows that 63% per cent. of the teachers are in their 
first year in their present posts, 23 per cent. in their 
second; of twenty-four schools lately visited in Louisiana, 
only oneschool hasthesame teacher as last year. Finally, 
the prevailing schoolhouse has still only one room, so 
that in most rural schools an untrained girl is left to cope 
alone with all grades and all subjects simultaneously. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
The account just given does not understate the diffi- 
culties of the problem. But there is another side to it. 
An inventory must take account not only of such facts, 
but of efforts and tendencies, not less real and, from the 
standpoint of development, much more significant. The 
defects which we have mentioned, and others, as well, 
are acutely felt and candidly admitted. Efforts are 
being everywhere made to remedy them. In North 
Carolina, the county has already been made the unit of 
school taxation, school administration, and of the appor- 
tionment of school funds; and a series of amendments 
has concentrated the educational administrative power 
in an appointive county board of education that selects 
the county superintendent. This type of organization 
has already achieved excellent results. A majority of 
the county superintendents of the state devote their 
entire time to their educational duties. Some have held 
office for ten or twelve or even fourteen years, and their
-P-A-G-E-221
RURAL EDUCATION 185 
salaries range as high as $2,400 with traveling expenses. 
The increase of salaries, in order to attract superior men, 
is indeed becoming quite common. In Mississippi, to 
give another instance, two thirds of the seventy-nine 
counties have now full-time superintendents, their sala- 
ties ranging as high as $1,800 per annum. Kentucky 
has made some progress along the same line. In South 
Carolina, two counties have petitioned the legislature for 
permission to abolish the elected in favor of an appoin- 
tive superintendent, and this most important step was 
long ago taken in Virginia. In Arkansas, the office of 
County Superintendent was for the first time made 
possible by the legislature in 1907, since which date 
twenty-one counties have taken favorable action. As- 
sistant superintendents, county supervisors, school super- 
visors, supervising teachers, whose duty it is to improve 
teaching and internal school conditions, are provided in 
Kentucky, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, and 
other states. An unmistakable effort to supplant the 
one-room school with a consolidated school of three or 
four rooms and as many teachers, with the differentiation 
in teaching and grading thus made possible, is succeeding 
here and there, and the improvement is likely to be 
accelerated by the introduction of the inexpensive auto- 
mobile. Four years ago, for example, there was not a 
consolidated school in Mississippi: there are now one 
hundred and seventy-five. In Pearl River County alone 
ten consolidated schools have replaced forty one-room 
schools. In Louisiana only twelve hundred one-room
-P-A-G-E-222
186 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
schools are left: the state has three hundred school 
wagons in use. In Alabama, despite constitutional 
inhibitions, sporadic efforts at consolidation have been 
made. The consolidated school buildings represent a 
striking advance in every respect. They are tasteful, 
convenient, well lighted, well ventilated; their teachers 
are happier and more stable; the schools are at times 
equipped for the teaching of domestic science, and asso- 
ciated with the club work and demonstration work now 
under way in all the states. The very substance of rural 
education has in these instances been more or less trans- 
formed. 
The foregoing examples are cited as evidence of the 
earnest striving characteristic of the situation. There is 
indeed no lack of such effort. But a serious difficulty, 
calculated to hamper and retard comprehensive re- 
organization, arises from the absence of sufficient contin- 
uous direction centred on the really fundamental factors 
of the situation. The South desires education; there is 
comparatively little need of undertaking to convince the 
people that popular education is essential to their develop- 
ment, though of course certain neighborhoods are back- 
ward and require such efforts. Moreover, the South is 
willing to pay for education more and more liberally, as it 
becomes able to do so. Finally, the South is struggling 
to educate itself and to improve its educational machinery 
and organization—struggling with courage and enthu- 
siasm to overcome obstacles created by poverty and long 
indifference. But adequate direction is lacking. This is

-P-A-G-E-224
RURAL EDUCATION 187 
the most serious defect, and it is, unfortunately, a defect 
that the states themselves are not likely to remedy en- 
tirely at this time. 
RURAL EDUCATION AGENTS 
Under these circumstances the General Education 
Board was convinced that valuable service could be 
rendered through the establishment of a rural education 
agent attached to the office of the State Superintendent 
and holding office continuously. The Board therefore 
authorized the expenditure of not exceeding $45,000 
during the current year for the salaries and expenses of 
such officers in eleven Southern states. Inasmuch as 
rural school conditions are backward in other sections 
of the country as well, the Board resolved further to offer 
similar facilities to selected states in the North, East. 
and West. 
It was understood that it would be the function of the 
rural school agent to assist in making a thorough and 
dispassionate survey of rural education in his state, 
including laws, organization, finance, equipment, teach- 
ing force and methods, etc. On this basis, under the 
direction of the State Department of Education and in 
coéperation with other appropriate agencies, organiza- 
tions, and individuals, an adequate local program was to 
be worked out. In general, this program should aim to 
bring about a readjustment, which will substitute the 
county for the district as the unit of organization, ad- 
ministration, and finance; an appointive superintendent
-P-A-G-E-225
188 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
with proper qualifications was to take the place of the 
elected superintendent; local as well as state taxation 
was to be made possible; consolidated schools to be 
favored; the one-room school to be reorganized and de- 
veloped; facilities to be provided for training teachers 
for a service rendered more permanent, more attractive, 
and more fruitful. It was to be the business of the rural 
education agent to aid the superintendent in recommend- 
ing the program agreed on to the people of the state, 
through popular enlightenment and through the organ- 
ization of all available forces. His time and energy were 
thus to be devoted to establishing the fundamental general 
conditions necessary to sound development. If improved 
conditions and improved facilities are thus provided, 
better schools and better teaching will result; intensive 
improvement of the schools, one at a time, may then 
profitably be undertaken by local authorities or other- 
wise. 
Subsequent to the passage by the General Education 
Board of the resolution above mentioned, the secretaries 
of the Board met the Southern State Superintendents 
in conference at Nashville. These officials were unani- 
mous in seeking the Board’s codperation. In conformity 
with the policy which has been repeatedly emphasized 
in this report, it was made clear that every state must 
handle its problem in its own way; that the Board had no 
detailed program to propose. This conference, however, 
developed distinct agreement to the effect that the most 
useful service that could at this juncture be rendered lay
-P-A-G-E-226
RURAL EDUCATION 189 
in the direction of bringing about the improved under- 
lying conditions above noted, as respects organization, 
taxation, length of school terms, salaries, training of 
teachers, etc. The rural school agent was to be an instru- 
ment in the hands of the State Superintendent to improve 
conditions as to those and other matters, the State Super- 
intendent being the judge as to the relative urgency of 
the several items forming the program. On this basis 
it was agreed that a concerted effort on more or less 
similar lines would result, the outcome of which would 
be a common movement toward a common end.
-P-A-G-E-227
VIII. NEGRO EDUCATION 
HE improvement of facilities for the education of 
the Negro was among the first subjects taken up 
by the General Education Board. In dealing 
with it, the Board has followed the method already de- 
scribed in connection with other activities: thorough in- 
quiries were made for the purpose of learning the details 
of the existing status—not only educational, but social 
and economic; and gifts of a tentative character were 
made in order that any program ultimately adopted 
might be the outcome of experiment and demonstration. 
In determining its successive steps, the Board has drawn 
on various sources of information and counsel. Its 
original surveys dealt fully with the conditions of Negro 
schools in the several states, public and private; special 
inquiries have from time to time thrown light on particu- 
lar aspects of the problem; the Secretary of the Board 
was for several years general agent of the Slater Fund, 
and in this capacity traveled extensively through the 
South, visiting Negro schools and conferring with both 
whites and blacks on the subject of Negro education; and 
the trustees and the president of the Jeanes Fund have 
been in close consultation and codperation with the offi- 
cers and members of the General Education Board.

FIRST STEPS IN NEGRO EDUCATION 
In the years immediately following the war Negro 
schools were founded throughout the South by several 
northern organizations, such, for example, as the Ameri- 
can Missionary Association, the Board of Missions for 
Freedmen of the Presbyterian Church, the Freedmen’s: 
Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the 
American Baptist Home Mission Society, and other 
similar organizations. These schools have, with varying 
degrees of success, rendered a large service, particularly 
in the training of teachers for the public schools and 
in the training of colored ministers. In some cases they 
have developed colleges which will form the nucleus of a~ 
system of schools for the higher education of Negroes. 
Any discussion of Negro education must recognize the 
disinterested motives of these organizations and the 
importance and value of the schools maintained by 
them. 
The Negroes themselves have organized a large num- 
ber of local schools, some of which have attained size 
and importance. These schools represent the aspira- 
tion of the Negro for self-culture, and have been accom- 
panied in many cases by sacrifice of the highest character. 
In addition to this, as is well known, large schools like 
Hampton and Tuskegee, which are strictly of private 
foundation, have been established. There are also a 
number: of private schools of undoubted value, like the 
schools located at Manassas, Va.; Calhoun, Snow Hill,
-P-A-G-E-230
192 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
and Mt. Meigs, Ala.; St. Helena Island, S. C.; Utica, 
Miss.; and others, which are largely supported by con- 
tributions from the North. 
Moreover, all the states of the South have founded 
normal schools for the training of Negro teachers, such, 
for example, as the well-known institutions at Normal 
and Montgomery, Alabama; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Talla- 
hassee, Florida; Frankfort, Kentucky; Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana; Alcorn, Mississippi; Greensboro and Win- 
ston-Salem, North Carolina; Orangeburg, South Caro- 
lina; Nashville, Tennessee; Prairie View, Texas; and 
Petersburg, Virginia. 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL FUNDAMENTAL 
While fully recognizing the importance of the work 
above described, and the importance of encouraging 
private initiative in this as in other educational fields, 
the Board, nevertheless, has kept steadily in view the 
obvious fact that in the education of the Negro as of the 
whites the public school must be the main reliance. An 
educational agency is needed large enough, well enough 
supported and organized to train enormous masses in the 
arts of civilization. The public school is the sole in- 
strumentality equal to a task of such magnitude. More- 
over, public schools can be developed only through the 
leadership of the Southern white. Northern philan- 
thropy may assist, as it has assisted and is assisting, gen- 
erously, intelligently, and sympathetically. But the 
main privilege and responsibility necessarily rest at this

-P-A-G-E-232
NEGRO EDUCATION 193 
juncture upon the South itself, and upon’ that part of the 
Southern people that is strongest in wealth, intelligence, 
and power. The General Education Board therefore 
resolved that, while certain privately managed institu- 
tions must be aided, its main purpose required that it 
coéperate with progressive Southern sentiment in cre- 
ating publicly supported educational systems. 
As education produces its natural results, the wealth, 
energy, and ambition of the Negroes themselves become 
more and more important factors. The Board has there- 
fore assisted the Negro to help himself, through his pri- 
vate schools, not so much by working upon him as by 
working with him; not by founding and supporting 
schools for him; but rather by helping him to found and 
support schools for himself. Fortunately, experience has 
shown that the Negroes welcome opportunities to turn 
these schools over to the public school system when the 
authorities are ready to support them; the two lines of 
effort thus move in harmony toward a single goal—an 
adequate public school organization. 
And it is especially the rural public school that is of 
interest to the Southern Negro. About 80 per cent. 
of the Negroes in the Southern states live on farms. City 
schools, normal schools, and colleges do but little for 
people who live in the open country. They can be 
helped only as efficient rural schools are developed. The 
problem is in principle identical with that discussed in 
the preceding chapter; it is more difficult only because 
of the greater poverty of the black, his limited develop-
-P-A-G-E-233
194 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
ment, and the prejudices that must be overcome. He 
profits, however, by the same tendencies that at the 
moment assist the rural whites: the turning of public 
sentiment in the direction of the country; the rise in value 
of farm lands and farm products due to the increased 
cost of living in towns; the increase in farm productivity 
by the introduction of machinery and better methods of 
farming; the general introduction of conveniences and 
amenities through the telephone, good roads, rapid 
transit, free delivery, and the parcel post. The data 
adduced in connection with farm demonstrations! prove 
that the Negro is eagerly taking advantage of his oppor- 
tunities to attain economic independence in the country; 
a fact that renders educational improvement at once 
more necessary, more hopeful, and more certain. 
STATE SUPERVISORS OF NEGRO RURAL SCHOOLS 
For the purpose of arousing interest and furnishing 
intelligent and specialized guidance, a state supervisor of 
Negro schools was supported in Virginia by the Peabody 
Education Fund and the Southern Education Board. 
The appointee had already demonstrated the value of 
such supervision while superintendent of schools in 
Henrico County, Virginia. The General Education 
Board, recognizing the importance of this work, decided to 
extend it throughout the South, as opportunity occurred. 
The Board offered to codperate with state departments 
of education by furnishing funds adequate to pay the

NEGRO EDUCATION 195 
salaries and expenses of state agents for Negro rural 
schools. Appropriations were to be made to the state 
departments and only on application of these depart- 
ments; the agent—or supervisor, as he is usually called— 
was to be chosen by the State Superintendent of Educa- 
tion and thus become a state official with all the powers 
and responsibilities of such a position. On this basis, 
agents are now supported by the General Education 
Board in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, 
Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. 
These agents are white men who have had large and 
successful experience in school management. They 
have in every instance gained the confidence not only of 
the colored people and the public school authorities, but 
of white citizens in general. As representing the state 
department, they have the entrée to all counties, com- 
munities, and schools: they transact the state’s business 
with county superintendents, county school boards, local 
trustees, and teachers. They interest the Negroes of a 
vicinity in the local school and bring the two races to 
join in its improvement. Substantial sums have thus 
been obtained from both races for local school improve- 
ments. They have already brought about the consoli- 
dation of several weak schools into central schools; they 
have participated in planning and constructing school 
buildings; in choosing teachers; in improving the curricu- 
lum, especially along industrial and domestic lines; in 
effecting codperation between the schools, farm demon- 
stration and club agents, and in securing gradually in-
-P-A-G-E-236
196 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
creasing allotments from public funds, of which, however, 
the expenditure on the Negro is still disproportionately 
small. For the support of these agents, the General 
Education Board appropriates $2,500 each per year for 
salary, and a sum not to exceed $1,000 each for necessary 
expenses. 
COOPERATION WITH THE ANNA T. JEANES FUND 
The effectiveness of this work has been greatly in- 
creased by its intimate association with the activities 
of the industrial supervisors and teachers supported 
by the Jeanes Fund. These teachers, appointed by the 
county superintendent and working under his direction, 
are at the same time in close codperation with the state 
agent maintained by the General Education Board. At 
the present time 128 such teachers are at work. They 
are for the most part graduates of Hampton, Tuskegee, 
Petersburg, Fisk, Atlanta, Spelman, and kindred insti- 
tutions. Each teacher visits a number of the country 
schools, gives a lesson in some industry, plans with the 
regular teacher to give additional lessons in her absence, 
organizes parents’ clubs, and starts a movement for better 
school equipment or longer term, counsels the local teacher 
about her daily teaching, and stirs the community to 
united effort to better the school. Many of these teachers 
are employed for the entire year; when school is no longer 
in session, they carry on similar work in the community. 
Wherever the industrial teacher and the rural school 
supervisor have gone, quick improvement is perceptible in

the physical appearance of grounds, buildings, and pupils. 
Improvement leagues are formed; money is raised by sub- 
scription to paint or whitewash the building, to buy a 
stove and procure the necessary equipment for cooking 
classes among both the girls and their mothers. Elemen- 
tary sanitation is inculcated; fairs and exhibitions are held 
through which the results are brought together for the 
pleasure and enlightenment of pupils and patrons. In 
1912-13, twenty-three supervising teachers worked under 
the general direction of the state supervisor in twenty-five 
Virginia counties: 591 schools were visited, 417 of them 
regularly; 189 extended their terms by one month, their 
patrons bearing the expense; 20 new schoolhouses were 
builtata costof $23,808; 15 more were enlarged ata cost of 
$2,212; 428; school leagues raised among Negroes $22,655. 
Tn 1913-14, supervising industrial teachers worked in 27 
counties; 22 new Negro schoolhouses, costing $18,230, 
were built; 12 enlarged, at a cost of $3,612; 182 extended 
their terms one month through subscriptions, mainly 
of their patrons; 125 sanitary outhouses were built; 
$28,673 was raised by Negroes for school improvements. 
It is impossible to draw a sharp line between this work 
and that of the clubs described as part of the farm demon- 
strations. In Virginia, for example, 14 teachers report 617 
girls in the clubs of 15 counties with 416 home gardens, 
of which two thirds are “excellent’’; the girls put up 10,504. 
jars of vegetables for home use, their mothers 12,269. 
“T spent August 5th and 6th with Superintendent Wash- 
ington of Caroline County,” writes the state supervisor
-P-A-G-E-239
198 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
in September, 1913. ‘‘ We joined the supervising teacher 
and the special agent in charge of canning clubs, and 
drove through the county, visiting the gardens of the vari- 
ous members of the club. Every garden was laid off in 
straight rows, usually eight, with a walk in the middle. 
There were two rows of flowers, two rows of cabbage, two 
rows of snap beans, one early and one late, and two rows 
of tomatoes. They were well cultivated, clean of weeds. 
Most of them had resisted the temptation to ‘hill’ the to- 
matoes, and cultivated level, as they were directed. In 
nearly every case the tomatoes were held up by some 
support. 
“On the 8th there was held at Bowling Green the 
first Conference of the Girls’ Canning and Poultry Clubs 
of Caroline County. Nearly all of the eighty members 
were present with their parents and other members of 
their families. They brought exhibits of their vegetables, 
canned goods, bread, cake, sewing, poultry, etc. Simple 
prizes given by the county school board were awarded. 
Girls who had been most successful and those who had 
overcome unusual difficulties were called on to tell how 
they cultivated their gardens, how they made fences, 
how they canned their tomatoes, or baked bread, etc. 
The prize for the best kept garden was awarded to two 
motherless girls eleven and twelve years of age, who kept 
house for their father. Their garden, located in a piece of 
newly cleared land, was a model of neatness and careful 
cultivation.’’ Similar experiences can be reported from 
the other states.

NEGRO EDUCATION 199 
IMPROVED RELATIONS OF RACES 
A more cordial relation between the races has followed 
in the wake of educational progress. Nothing, indeed, 
is of fairer promise than the awakened interest of the 
white—superintendent and layman—in the improve- 
ment of Negro schools. For example, a conference of 
Alabama County Superintendents with the State Super- 
intendent and the State Supervisor of Negro Schools 
visits Tuskegee Institute in a body and confesses “a new 
vision in regard to the Negro’’; again, the state; super- 
visor addresses the Y. M. C. A. of the, State College of 
Agriculture at Auburn, Alabama, on the Negro problem, 
and forty-five members subsequently accompany him on 
a visit of inspection to Tuskegee. At.one of the summer 
institutes held for Negro teachers in.Georgia, the work 
of the Negro industrial teacher was:so novel and inter- 
esting that the white county superintendent asked her to 
come over to the white institute in order to give a demon- 
stration of her work. She was kept half a day answering 
questions and explaining the way she did the work. At 
other times, white teachers have gone to see what the 
Negroes were doing in their institute. What they ob- 
serve surprises the whites, and the experience affords 
pleasure and stimulation to the Negro teachers. ‘“‘Shall 
this not be a mighty entering wedge to reach the preju- 
dices and the sympathies of the white people?” asks 
the state agent in reporting the incidents. From 
North Carolina comes an account of a meeting of lead-
-P-A-G-E-241
200 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
ing white citizens at the Slater Normal School for Negroes. 
Among them were the city and county superintendents 
of schools and several members of the Board of Trustees. 
The object of the meeting was to study the condition and 
needs of the normal school in order to devise means by 
which it may train more and better teachers and serve 
the Negro race more effectively. Plans for the erection 
of a new dormitory for girls, and for improving the 
teacher training course were discussed. 
IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS 
‘By way of.improving the quality of the teaching, 
summer institutes have been widely developed by the 
state supervisors.. In 1913, thirty-seven such institutes 
were conducted in Alabama, with an attendance of 1,800 
teachers, who received instruction in academic, industrial, 
and domestic branches; of the total expense of $2,600, the 
state contributed-$1,500, the teachers themselves $1,000, 
and the Slater Board $100. In Arkansas, five State In- 
dustrial Summer Normal Schools were held in June, 1914. 
The attendance was 935. Meanwhile, county institutes 
were simultaneously in progress throughout the state. 
Large summer schools, in which the state supervisors 
assist, are held regularly at Hampton, Tuskegee, and 
other institutions. “A spirit of helpfulness and de- 
votion characterized the work of these Negro educators,” 
writes the white supervisor in his account of the 
summer’s efforts. Similar undertakings are in progress 
in every Southern state.

SELF-HELP 
Most interesting and significant of all are the indica- 
tions of self-help reported from all directions. Christian 
County, Kentucky, reports in a single year 13 new build- 
ings, 5 new sites, 7 schools with new furniture, 63 new 
outbuildings, 2 new fences, 2 new cisterns, 31 new stoves 
—toward all of which the colored people themselves had 
subscribed more than half. The whites of Fordyce, 
Arkansas, donated land and lumber for a new building 
for the Negro school; the colored people of the town 
contributed $150 toward putting it up. In Ben Hill 
County, Georgia, a $1,600 schoolhouse and ten acres of 
land were furnished by the town for an industrial school; 
the Negroes thereupon raised $550, which the county 
duplicated, to add two more rooms and an additional 
teacher. At Spottsylvania, Virginia, the Negroes had 
acquired 160 acres of land and $800 toward a private 
secondary school; the school board, impressed by their 
eagerness, took it over as a public graded school to be 
maintained by the county. In Caroline County, Vir- 
ginia, whites and blacks have emulated each other in 
consolidating and reconstructing, largely out of their 
own pockets, the country schools. The experience of 
this county, indeed, proves the soundness of the policy 
that has thus far been pursued. The Negroes had estab- 
lished at Bowling Green an Industrial Academy with ten 
acres of land and a building costing together $2,000; this 
they have offered to turn over to the county school
-P-A-G-E-244

board to be used as a county training school for teachers 
—the state contributing $350, the Slater Fund $500 
annually toward maintenance. Four rural schools, 
built by the Negroes at a cost of $5,400, and three 
others in process of construction, to cost $4,900, have 
been donated to the county. These schools all 
previously had one room and ran for five months: now 
they have from two to five rooms and run for eight 
months. The whites of Caroline County look with sym- 
pathy and pride on these improvements; the donation 
of the schools is an evidence of the mutual trust 
and confidence that has sprung up between the two 
races. Similar examples can be cited from Amelia 
County, Charlotte County, Cumberland County, and 
elsewhere. 
THE JEANES FUND OF THE GENERAL 
EDUCATION BOARD 
The income from $200,000 given to the General Edu- 
cation Board by Miss Anna T. Jeanes* has been utilized 
in stimulating efforts of this kind. Between 1906 and 
1912, seventy-four schools in Alabama were thus aided; 
toward buildings and equipment, costing $54,153, the 
Jeanes Fund of the General Education Board contributed 
$18,888; Negro patrons of the schools, $35,265; toward 
$17,690 spent in maintenance in the year 1910-11, the 
Fund gave $1,068, county boards, $9,070, and Negro 
patrons, $7,552.

APPROPRIATIONS TO INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTES 
At the present time, schools are fortunate if they obtain 
as principals and teachers the graduates of one of the 
better industrial schools for Negroes. The General Edu- 
cation Board has therefore assisted some of the more 
efficient of these industrial training schools as follows:

With the same end in view, gifts toward improved 
physical equipment have been made to a number of sec- 
ondary schools owned or controlled by Negroes them- 
selves—e. g., Waters Normal Institute (Winton, North 
Carolina); Thompson Institute (Lumberton, North Car- 
olina); Jeruel Academy (Athens, Georgia); Americus 
Institute (Americus, Georgia) ; Howe Institute (Memphis, 
Tennessee); Florida Baptist Academy (Jacksonville, 
Florida) ; and others. 
HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 
While the main stress has been, and for some time 
must continue to be, laid on the activities which we 
have described, it has also been recognized that the 
higher education of the Negro ought not to be neglected. 
The reasoning followed in dealing with secondary schools
-P-A-G-E-247
204 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
and colleges for whites is equally valid for Negroes. 
That is, if primary and secondary Negro schools are to 
have good teachers, principals, and supervisors, provision 
must be made for the higher training of these instructors 
and officers. Moreover, competent Negroes often desire 
higher education as the basis for some form of specialized 
or professional training. Personal aspiration and race 
welfare unite in suggesting the development of suitable 
academic opportunities for those who are capable. 
In the years immediately succeeding the war, many 
institutions were founded for the higher education of 
Negroes. In too many instances, however, these well- 
meant endeavors were entered upon without due con- 
sideration of the magnitude of the work and the diffi- 
culties involved. Colleges and universities may be 
never so desirable, but such institutions cannot be created 
without a competent faculty, a capable student body, 
suitable facilities, and ample and continuous financial 
support. 
In the period with which we are dealing, none of these 
essential conditions could be met. A small number of 
capable teachers were indeed secured—mainly Northern 
men and women inspired by missionary spirit; but, gen- 
erally speaking, scholarly faculties could not at that 
time be recruited for the far too numerous colleges and 
universities established for the colored race. Again, as 
is evident from the previous sections of this chapter, 
there were practically no organized facilities for the 
preliminary training of a body of college students.

Finally, funds in sufficient amounts were yet to be raised 
and plants provided. 
In the last few years, however, order has begun to 
emerge from chaos. Public school systems are beginning 
to take shape; and though in the main their work is still 
limited to the elementary grades, nevertheless, here and 
there—as, for example, at Little Rock—an excellent 
public high school has been established. Preparatory 
schools have also been developed—either as the academic 
departments of industrial institutes, or in connection 
with the colleges and universities. Thus, in one way or 
another, fair opportunities for procuring the necessary 
secondary training are now open to energetic boys and 
girls who enjoy the necessary support or are willing “to 
work their way through.” 
Meanwhile, the formation of a better teaching staff 
has become feasible. A small number of colored men 
and women have been graduated by Oberlin, Amherst, 
Brown, Harvard, and other institutions, a large propor- 
tion of whom have from the outset had college teaching 
definitely in view; in addition, many of the most capable 
graduates of the Negro colleges, keenly realizing the 
deficiencies of their training, have from time to time 
sought the larger opportunities offered by the summer 
schools or extension courses at Columbia, the University 
of Chicago, and elsewhere. 
Nevertheless, the situation still abounds in difficulties. 
Pure and high motives led religious and philanthropic 
organizations, white and colored, to establish their so-
-P-A-G-E-250
206 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
called colleges and universities. But, as there was no 
codperation at the outset, so there has been no codper- 
ation since. Each of the interested bodies went, and 
has continued to go, its own way, with little regard to 
what other similar bodies had undertaken or were in- 
tending. The number of institutions now struggling for 
existence is out of all relation to the number of qualified 
teachers and students procurable, the financial resources 
available for support, and the service to be performed. 
Inevitably, therefore, internal college conditions are 
bound to be unsatisfactory. A college consists essen- 
tially of an adequate and homogeneous student body, 
and a competent staff occupied with their training. 
But the aggregate number of competent students is so 
small that there are colleges with as few as eight or 
ten collegiate students. In consequence of this scarcity 
of students trained up to college level, secondary and 
even elementary instruction forms the main activity of 
most Negro colleges and universities. In only one insti- 
tution is it claimed that as many as one half the stu- 
dents are above the high school level; in most institu- 
tions the number of college students is less than 10 per 
cent. of the total enrolment. Besides, limited as it is, 
the student body is far from being sufficiently uniform 
in training or capacity. Under these circumstances 
the college teachers are required to do an inordinately 
large amount of non-collegiate teaching; and their college 
instruction is addressed to an unduly small and a dis- 
tinctly uneven student body.
-P-A-G-E-251
NEGRO EDUCATION 207 
These difficulties are in many places aggravated by 
the teachers themselves, who pitch their instruction on 
a plane at once too high and too remote. The mistake 
is not an unnatural one. These teachers are men and 
women of unusual ability, energy, and ambition. Eager 
to train at a high level the future leaders of their race, 
they emulate the procedure of the colleges for white 
boys in which they have themselves studied. As a 
result, their teaching is too often concerned with tasks 
which their students are incapable of mastering, or for 
which there is no practical outcome. The courses 
offered are often too abstract, too ambitious, or too 
learned. The students are not lacking in earnestness; 
they apply themselves to their tasks with all the energy 
they can summon. But the tasks are too frequently 
beyond their strength. They strain to grasp what is 
simply beyond their reach. i 
From the foregoing discussion, several important 
conclusions follow. A higher education ought to be 
furnished to capable Negro men and women; but the 
mere attempt to deliver the traditional college curriculum 
to the Negro does not constitute a higher education. 
His own needs, environment, capacity, and opportunity 
should be freshly studied and college curricula should be 
framed in the light of the facts thus elicited. Moreover, 
these curricula should all be regarded as experimental. 
Teachers should be constantly on the lookout, in order 
to determine whether the preparatory training of the 
student is adequate to the collegiate tasks imposed, and,
-P-A-G-E-252
208 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
if so, whether the tasks in question subserve their in- 
tended purpose. As conditions change, particularly as 
elementary and secondary training improves, corres- 
ponding readjustments can be made. The entire pro- 
cedure must, however, be tentative and critical, rather 
than cut-and-dried or imitative. Obviously, the or- 
ganization and management of Negro colleges at this 
juncture call for educational initiative and resourceful- 
ness in unusual measure. 
It is clear that under existing conditions only a few 
efficient colleges for Negroes can or ought to be main- 
tained. The organizations engaged in promoting the 
higher education of the race should therefore concentrate 
on a reduced number of institutions. In order to obtain 
a sufficiently large number of qualified students more ° 
feeding schools should be developed; indeed, some of the 
so-called colleges might well be converted into secondary 
schools for this purpose. For the system thus created, 
consisting of several preparatory schools and a few col- 
leges, larger financial support should then be arranged. 
Finally, for each of the few colleges thus reorganized, 
highly intelligent educational direction is required. The 
function of the head of a Negro college is necessarily 
somewhat different from that of the usual college or 
university president. He must, of course, be a good 
administrator; but a very large part of his energy must 
be devoted to outright pedagogical effort. He must not 
only select, but assist in training, his teachers; and he 
must by observation and conference assure himself that
-P-A-G-E-253
NEGRO EDUCATION 209 
the instruction offered is calculated to achieve the end 
in view. For some time to come he will resemble a 
principal or director rather than a university president, 
as that officer is usually conceived.

APPENDIX IT 
CONTRACT BETWEEN WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY 
AND BARNES HOSPITAL 
This agreement made and entered into this 28th day 
of October, A. D. 1911, by and between Samuel M. Ken- 
nard, Samuel Cupples, and Murray Carleton, Trustees 
of the Barnes Hospital, under and by the virtue of the 
will of Robert A. Barnes, deceased, for themselves and 
their successors in trust, hereinafter styled the Trustees, 
and the Washington University, a corporation existing 
under special charter under the laws of the State of 
Missouri, hereinafter styled the University, witnesseth: 
That whereas the Trustees have become satisfied, after 
a thorough examination conducted by them, that the 
efficiency of a hospital depends, in large part, upon the 
ability of its medical staff, and that a hospital can render 
better service to its patients when it has associated with 
it an organized medical school and scientific staff, labora- 
tories, and dispensary: 
And whereas the University realizes from actual experi- 
ence that a medical department of a university is greatly 
benefited by having a hospital connected with it in which 
it can teach its students, from actual observation of the 
sick, by the student observing the treatment of the sick 
and injured at the bedside and in the operating room: 
Now, therefore, the Trustees, for and in consideration 
of the University fulfilling its agreements hereinafter 
225
-P-A-G-E-270
226 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
made by it in this agreement as to building a medical 
school, a dispensary, equipping and maintaining the same, 
and treating the sick and injured in the hospital, hereby 
agrees that it will, within twelve months after this agree- 
ment is signed, start to build, and with all reasonable 
dispatch have built for them a first class hospital at a 
cost of not less than six hundred thousand dollars 
($600,000) upon the ground now owned by them, or which 
may be hereinafter acquired by them, between Kings- 
highway on the west, West Kingshighway on the south, 
Euclid on the east, and the Wabash Railroad on the 
north, and, after the said hospital is erected, to there- 
after, during the life of this agreement, maintain and 
operate the same, according to the best-known methods 
of running a hospital, within the limitation of their means 
or income. 
And the Trustees further agree that the medical staff 
of the hospital shall consist solely of the teaching corps 
of the Medical Department of the University, but in any 
instance where the Trustees shall object for good and 
sufficient cause, in writing delivered to the University, 
to the attendance at the hospital of any member of the 
said teaching corps, he shall be withdrawn from the 
medical staff of the hospital and the University shall 
appoint in his stead some other doctor, but no objection 
shall be made to any member of the teaching corps be- 
coming or remaining a member of the medical staff of 
the hospital on account of his practising the theory of 
medicine and practice taught by the University for the 
time being, as long as the Medical Department of the 
University continues to teach the theory of, medicine 
and practice most prevailing in the medical schools con- 
nected with the leading universities of the United States. 
This clause is not to be understood to give the University
-P-A-G-E-271
APPENDIX 227 
a right to have a doctor in its teaching corps for the sole 
purpose of allowing him to become a member of the 
medical staff of the hospital, but he must be an active 
member of the teaching corps. This clause is not to be 
understood that there cannot be members of the medical 
staff who are not members of the teaching corps of the 
Medical Department of the University, but if the Uni- 
versity and the Trustees wish to have in the medical staff 
of the hospital doctors who are not members of the teach- 
ing corps of the Medical Department of the University, 
the University may suggest names to the Trustees and 
the Trustees may appoint from such names, as suggested, 
additional members to the medical staff of the hospital, 
who may be discharged or dropped from the medical staff 
of the hospital at the will of the Trustees or at the will of 
the University. 
And the Trustees further agree that the medical staff 
of the hospital, constituted as above provided, shall have 
the exclusive right to render such medical service as may 
be rendered to any patient of the hospital therein by 
any physician or surgeon, and to direct in all respects the 
treatment therein of any such patient or patients by 
persons not physicians or surgeons. It is understood, 
however, that any patient may at his or her request, or 
at the request of his or her guardian, call into con- 
sultation any physician not a member of the medical 
staff. 
And the Trustees further agree that the members of 
the teaching corps of the Medical Department of the 
University shall have the fullest and exclusive possible 
right consistent with the welfare of the patient to use the 
ward patients in the hospital for medical research and 
clinical instruction to the students of the University and 
medical staff of the hospital.
-P-A-G-E-272
228 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
The Trustees further agree that they will nominate a 
man for superintendent, and appoint him upon the ap- 
proval of the University. If the first man nominated 
by the Trustees does not meet with the approval of the 
University, then the Trustees shall nominate another man 
and submit his name for approval to the University. 
If the second man does not meet with the approval of the 
University, then the University shall nominate a man and 
submit his name for approval to the Trustees, and, if he 
shall not receive the approval of the Trustees, the Uni- 
versity shall submit the name of another for the approval 
of the Trustees. If the second name so submitted shall 
not be approved by the Trustees, the Trustees shall 
then proceed to appoint a superintendent without sub- 
mitting his name for approval, but the Trustees shall 
not so appoint any man as superintendent whom they 
have submitted for approval and such approval been 
refused. 
The nurses shall be employed, controlled, paid, and 
discharged by the Trustees, but when in actual attend- 
ance upon a patient they shall be under the direction of 
the member of the medical staff attending such patient, 
and, if such member objects to a nurse, she shall be with- 
drawn from attendance of such patient. 
All the agreements herein stated shall continue and 
remain in force for the term of fifty (50) years from the 
date hereof. 
Either party to this agreement may abrogate the same 
at the end of thirty (30) years from the date hereof by 
giving to the other party notice in writing not less than 
three (3) years prior thereto of their or its intention to 
abrogate the same. Any party giving such notice shall 
not have a right to withdraw the same without the con- 
sent of the other party.
-P-A-G-E-273
APPENDIX 229 
The Trustees further agree that, if the said hospital 
shall be wholly or partially destroyed by fire or the ele- 
ments, they will rebuild or repair as soon as possible. 
The Trustees hereby agree to make and maintain from 
time to time such rules and regulations as may be neces- 
sary to carry into full force and effect all the terms and 
provisions of this contract. 
Now therefore the University, for and in consideration 
of the Trustees fulfilling their agreements hereinbefore set 
forth, hereby agrees that it will, within twelve months 
after the signing of this agreement, start to build and 
with all reasonable dispatch have built for it a first class 
dispensary at a cost of not less than one hundred thou- 
sand dollars ($100,000) on the ground now owned by it, 
or which may hereafter be acquired by it, within the 
boundaries as hereinbefore set out for the hospital 
site. 
And it further agrees that it will, within twelve months 
after the signing of this agreement, start to build and with 
all reasonable dispatch have built for it first class medical 
school buildings at a cost of not less than two hundred 
thousand dollars ($200,000) on or near Euclid Avenue 
between the Wabash Railroad right of way and Chouteau 
Avenue in the City of St. Louis. : 
The University further agrees that it will equip and 
maintain in the dispensary and medical school buildings 
all the necessary and usual laboratories that are found in 
well-recognized dispensaries, medical school buildings, 
and hospitals, and that such of these laboratories as are 
necessary and useful to a hospital shall be open at such 
times as such laboratories are usually open in first class 
hospitals for the use of the medical staff of the hospital. 
And it further agrees that it will employ all necessary 
scientists for the operating of its laboratories, and that
-P-A-G-E-274
230 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
those so employed shall do the laboratory work inci- 
dental and necessary to the hospital, free of charge to the 
hospital or its ward patients. 
The University further agrees to have only among its 
teaching corps, and for its scientists working in its labora- 
tories, doctors and scientists who are learned in their 
profession. 
The University further agrees that the medical staff 
shall treat all patients in the wards of the hospital free 
of charge, and shall give to such patients all proper medi- 
cal attention. 
It is further agreed and understood by both the Trus- 
tees and the University that reasonable and customary 
charges for professional services shall be made by the 
staff to pay patients occupying private rooms. 
The Trustees shall have nothing to do with the collect- 
ing of fees due doctors for any services rendered within 
the hospital. If any patient or his representatives 
shall object to and dispute the charge made by any 
member of the medical staff for services rendered in 
the hospital, the same shall be submitted to the Trus- 
tees who shall determine what the charge shall be, and 
the finding of the Trustees shall be binding on the 
physician. 
The University further agrees that the medical staff 
shall teach and give the necessary instruction in the 
hospital, or any other nearby place designated by the 
Trustees, to the nurses and those who are training to be- 
come nurses in the hospital, free of charge to the hospital 
and to the nurses in the hospital. 
In testimony whereof the Trustees have hereunto set 
their hands and seals and the University has caused these 
presents to be signed, in duplicate, in its corporate name 
by Robert S. Brookings, its President, and its corporate

their successors in trust, hereinafter styled the Trustees, 
WITNESSETH: WHEREAS the Nurses’ Training School 
of the University has been and now is training 
nurses for the Washington University Hospital and the 
St. Louis Children’s Hospital, and has rendered to each 
an exact account of the expense of such training, including

teaching service as is rendered by the said University’s 
medical staff, but had expected to house and board all of 
its own nurses pending the expected gift of a Nurses’ 
Home; and ‘

versity may charge as rent for said Home five per cent. 
(5%) on the cost of building, furnishings, and fence (no

nurses working in the Barnes Hospital shall bear to the 
total number of nurses housed in the Nurses’ Home above 
referred to. 
In testimony whereof, the University has caused these 
presents to be signed, in duplicate, in its corporate 
name by Robert S. Brookings, its President, and its

APPENDIX 233 
and located in the City of New Haven, in said State, 
hereinafter called ‘‘The University,” and The General 
Hospital Society of Connecticut, a corporation also ex- 
isting under the laws of said State and located in said

Whereas, the Hospital maintains, and has for many 
years maintained a general hospital situated in said City 
of New Haven, on a tract of land bounded northerly 
by Davenport Avenue, easterly by Cedar Street, south- 
erly by Congress Avenue, and westerly by Howard 
Avenue; and 
Whereas, the University maintains, and has for many 
years maintained, in said city a department of medicine

cine and surgery; and 
Whereas, the parties hereto are united in the belief 
that a closer alliance between them will render the Hos- 
pital more useful to its patients and to the community, 
and will benefit said University by enabling it to give 
the best clinical instruction to its students, and afford 
the best opportunities for advanced study and scientific 
research; and 
Whereas, it is deemed necessary by both parties hereto 
that the sum of at least six hundred thousand dollars 
($600,000) be raised and used for the purposes herein- 
after expressed, and said University has not available 
the necessary funds for such purposes, but is endeavoring 
to raise the same as part of a comprehensive plan to in- 
crease the endowment and efficiency both of the Hospital 
and of the Medical School; and 
Whereas, in the opinion of the parties hereto, it will

or otherwise that the agreement of the parties hereto 
be reduced to writing, as hereinafter expressed; and 
Whereas, this agreement is not to become operative 
and effective unless and until said University gives the 
written notice hereinafter stated: 
Now, therefore, the parties hereto, in consideration of 
the mutual covenants hereinafter expressed, do hereby 
agree as follows: 
First: This agreement shall take effect and become 
operative upon receipt prior to July 1st, 1914, by the 
President of the Hospital, of written notice from the 
University, that the University has acquired or set apart 
not less than six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000) 
which it agrees to use for the purposes hereinafter stated. 
If such notice is not received by said President, prior to 
July 1st, 1914, then this agreement shal] be null, void, 
and of no effect. 
Second: Upon and after the giving and receiving of 
such notice prior to said date: 
(1) The University agrees to pay to the Hospital, as 
hereinafter stated, such amount as shall be required to 
completely erect and fully equip in a workmanlike and 
proper manner, and with all suitable technical and other 
apparatus, on said land belonging to the Hospital, a 
fire-proof building, similar in character, design, and 
standard of construction and equipment to the new ad- 
ministration building to be built by the Hospital, to 
be used as a clinical and pathological laboratory, to be 
known by such name as the University may direct, and 
pursuant to plans and specifications to be approved by 
the Corporation of Yale University, or some agent ap- 
pointed by said Corporation for that purpose, and by the 
Directors of the Hospital. The cost of said building shall 
not exceed $115,000 and the cost of said equipment shall
-P-A-G-E-279
APPENDIX 235 
not exceed $10,000 unless otherwise mutually agreed. 
Said money shall be paid by the University to the Hos- 
pital in installments upon the written order or request 
of the Executive Committee of the Hospital, or a major- 
ity thereof, in order that the Hospital may be put in 
funds to meet the payments as they shall severally be- 
come due under any contract or contracts executed by the 
Hospital for the erection and furnishing of said labo- 
ratory, and for the purchase of said suitable technical and 
other apparatus to be used therein. 
(2) The University further agrees to hold and man- 
age the balance of said fund of six hundred thousand 
dollars ($600,000) as an endowment fund, with full 
power to sell and convey the same, or any part thereof, in 
its discretion, and to invest and reinvest the proceeds of 
such sale or sales, and keep said fund invested either 
separately and apart from the other funds held by the 
University or to mingle the same with such other funds 
and not to keep the same separately invested, and to 
collect and receive the income thereof from time to time 
accruing. If such fund is not kept separately invested, 
then the income thereof for each year shall be deemed to 
be such sum as is equivalent to the annual interest, cal- 
culated at the end of each year, upon said balance to- 
gether with any accumulations that may be added thereto 
from time to time, at the average rate of income derived 
during each preceding year by the University from all its 
general invested funds. The judgment and determina- 
tion of the Treasurer of the University as to such aver- 
age rate, the value of such invested funds, the equivalent 
of said annual income, and all other conditions which 
may be necessary in order to determine such equivalent 
shall be final and conclusive. 
(3) The University further agrees to expend the in-
-P-A-G-E-280
236 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
come of the balance of said fund or its equivalent calcu- 
lated as aforesaid, together with any additional sum or 
sums of money that may be needed from time to time, 
for the payment of salaries and other expenses herein- 
after agreed to be paid by the University. If the income 
of said balance or its equivalent calculated as aforesaid 
shall be more than-sufficient to pay said salaries and ex- 
penses, said excess shall be applied by the University 
for such purposes of the Medical School in connection 
with the Hospital as the Executive Committee of the 
Hospital and the Executive Board of said Medical School 
shall agree, or, failing such agreement, such excess shall 
be added to the principal of said fund. 
(4) The University hereby further agrees to pay 
from time to time out of the income of said fund or its 
equivalent calculated as aforesaid, or out of other moneys 
belonging to the University, if said income or its equiv- 
alent is not sufficient for such purposes, for all proper and 
necessary repairs on all technical apparatus used in said 
building and for the replacement of such apparatus as 
may be worn out or destroyed and reasonably necessary 
to be replaced, including the expense of all chemicals and 
destructible supplies, and to pay the salaries of all needed 
scientific and educational workers in said laboratory, 
including a resident pathologist and bacteriologist, an 
assistant, a technician in pathology, a technician in sur- 
gery, a technician in medicine, a radiographer, a historian, 
head internes in medicine, surgery, and pathology, who 
shall each render his appropriate service to the Hospital 
and its patients, and the University shall also pay the 
salaries of a janitor or janitors, if more than one is rea- 
sonably necessary, to be employed in or about said labo- 
ratory, and to be appointed by the University; provided, 
however, that said appointees named in this paragraph   
     
-P-A-G-E-281
APPENDIX 237 
shall be acceptable to the Hospital and subject to all 
reasonable rules and regulations of the Hospital. 
Third: Upon and after the giving and receiving of 
such notice prior to said date: 
(1) The Hospital agrees to completely erect and fully 
equip, in a workmanlike and proper manner, and with 
all suitable technical and other apparatus, on said land, 
a fireproof building of the. character hereinbefore speci- 
fied, to be used as a clinical and pathological laboratory 
to be known by such name as the University may direct, 
and pursuant to plans and specifications to be approved 
as aforesaid, and to pay for the same out of said fund to 
be provided by the University as hereinbefore stated, 
and the Hospital agrees to keep and maintain said build- 
ing in good repair during the continuance of this agree- 
ment. 
(2) The Hospital hereby further agrees to permit the 
Corporation of Yale University to nominate, as vacancies 
occur, suitable persons for the positions of attending 
physicians, surgeons, and specialists in medicine and 
surgery on the staff of the Hospital, also for the positions 
of resident bacteriologist and pathologist, an assistant, 
a technician in pathology, a technician in surgery, a 
technician in medicine, a radiographer, a historian, head 
internes in medicine, surgery, and pathology above 
mentioned; it being agreed that the University shall 
appoint one or more janitors, if more than one is reason- 
ably necessary to be employed in or about said labora- 
tory. And the Hospital further agrees that all of said 
positions, except the position of janitor of said laboratory, 
shall be filled by election by the Directors of said Hos- 
pital upon such nominations and not otherwise, it being 
agreed, however, that the physicians, surgeons, and 
specialists connected with the Hospital at the time this
-P-A-G-E-282
238 THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD 
agreement becomes effective shall continue in the service 
of the Hospital until each shall respectively resign his 
position, or until the term of service of each shall ter- 
minate pursuant to the present regulations of the Hos- 
pital. If any such nomination is objected to by vote of 
the Directors of the Hospital duly passed at a meeting 
duly held, such nomination shall be withdrawn upon the 
written request of said Directors, or a majority of them, 
stating the grounds of their objections thereto, and 
another nomination shall be promptly substituted therefor 
until a nomination satisfactory to said Directors shall 
be made; it being the intent of this agreement that the 
Hospital shall secure for the treatment of its patients the 
greatest degree of medical and surgical skill that can be 
furnished by said Medical School. It is further agreed 
that in case of failure to secure a nomination or nomina- 
tions satisfactory to the Hospital Directors after six 
months from the time when any vacancy shall occur, and

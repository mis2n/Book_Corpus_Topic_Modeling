INTRODUCTION 
proverb which may also be applied to the hours of Life’s Morning; for 
their value is inestimable. 
To claim that childhood is the golden age of one’s existence is going altogether too 
far, as most of us can testify. Incidents that amuse us, as we recall them, at that 
period often clad themselves in the costumes of tragedy. As Thomas Bailey Aldrich 
aptly observes, “The marble rolls out of sight and the world vanishes with it; the 
doll is broken and the universe is shattered likewise.” The man who threatened to 
cut our ears off and the dragon-flies who were said to sew them up gave us such thrills Mv prove witch HAT GOLD IM MUND’. Thus runs the familiar 
of terror as nothing now can inspire. 
On the other hand, this very intensity of emotion and vividness of impression are 
faculties which, if rightly applauded, are sources of infinite pleasure and profit. The 
unencumbered mind seizes with avidity and retains that which is congenial in a manner 
rarely equalled in later life. Sir Walter Scott, in speaking of his marvellous memory, 
modestly said that he merely remembered what interested him. 
The problem therefore of the conscientious teacher is, how to make his topic attrac- 
tive. Many of us remember with gratitude those instructors who so stimulated the 
imagination that learning was a joy, while the blunders of those who caused us to 
stumble through studies (in themselves interesting) are the source of mournful regret. 
The question, so much discussed of late, “ Are the Americans to become a musical 
people?” can best be answered after they have enjoyed the opportunities to hear, and 
perchance to participate in, the production of music of a high character. In order to 
secure the intelligent vote of the general public, that public must be approached when 
it is young; hence the importance of the movement on foot in many communities 
to introduce masical studies in the schools and universities. 
Among the efforts to create something that shall instruct and delight the growing 
musical public is the volume of “Art Song Cycles”; words by Florence C. Fox, 
music by Professor W. Otto Miessner: 
Glancing through the work and selecting a few representative numbers from each 
cycle for inspection, one is impressed with the great sincerity and enthusiasm of the 
collaborators. One wishes that school children of the last generation might have 
enjoyed something of the kind, sc that music might have meant something more to 
them than a mere strumming upon three or four primary chords.
-P-A-G-E-6
Again, while a fondness for a better class of music is encouraged, we can see how 
in learning songs from the various cycles devoted to botany, entomology, ornithology, 
geography, mythology, etc., a child cannot fail to acquire a taste for these studies. 
The habits of different birds and insects are impressed upon the mind by means 
of characteristic motives. The suggestive bits of local color in the songs, about people 
of different countries and the myths they believe in are helpful to the memory, while 
the unique group dealing with the diverse methods of sowing seeds adopted by various 
plants will set many to thinking. 
Occasionally, in the endeavor to render the setting especially fitting to the subject 
at hand, the accompaniment becomes somewhat difficult for the average amateur, 
But there is surely no school that does not number among its teachers and pupils 
at least one who, with a little effort, can master these passages. ‘The result is certainly 
well worth the effort, by virtue of the great pleasure afforded the listeners, in deliver- 
ing them from the humdrum of the conventional work with which all are familiar. 
A fondness for children, and a warm-hearted enthusiasm for making them happy, 
is manifest throughout the entire series of pretty verses and picturesque settings. 
Their introduction into the public schools is therefore to be heartily recommended. 
In Mr. Miessner we have to deal with a young composer whose inherent gifts are 
such that he can well be expected to make his mark, and that a worthy one, combining 
as he does genuine creative ability with most praiseworthy self-criticism.

REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION.

oe OF THE INTERIOR, | 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., January 1, 1894. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith my fourth annnal report, 
the same being for the year ending June 30, 1892. 
GENERAL STATISTICS.! 
The total number of pupils in schools of all grades, public and private, 
including all who attended for longer or shorter periods at some time 
~ during the school year, is given (p. 2) at 14,714,933, or 22.69 per cent 
of the population. 
This number, however, does not include the pupils enrolled in evening 
schools, nor in schools of art or industry, in business colleges, in schools 
for defective classes, nor in the Indian schools. These make an aggre- 
gate of more than 300,000 pupils, and increase the total in school to over 
‘15,000,000 pupils. 
The average annual increase of the school enrollment for the six 
years next preceding (1885-1891) was nearly 250,000 pupils (249,260). 
This is about the same ratio as the increase in population. But the 
average increase for the twenty-one years, 1870-71 to 1891-92, has 
been something greater (268,780), and also in excess of the ratio of the 
inerease in population. 
GRADE OF PUPILS.   Of these pupils 14,165,182, or 96.27 per cent of all pupils, were 
enrolled in the elementary grades included in the first eight years of 
school work. In the secondary schools, including public high schools 
and private academies or seminaries, there were in all 402,089 pupils 
(or 2.73 per cent. of all) engaged on studies belonging to the third 
period of four years of school work (ninth to twelfth year). Only 
147,662 pupils (or 1 per cent of all) were enrolled in the higher studies 
included in the fourth period of four years’ school work, carried on in 
colleges, universities, professional and technical schools, including nor- 
mal schools for the training of teachers. Out. of an average number 
of 1,000 pupils 963 are in the elementary schools, 27 in the high school, , 
and 10 in the college or professional school. 
1 See Chapters I and II, pp. 1-72.
-P-A-G-E-12
REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
Out of every 100 pupils in the elementary grade (or first eight years 
of school work) 91.54 pupils are in public schools and 8.46 pupils in pri- 
vate schools. But in secondary education (ninth to twelfth years’ work) 
the proportion in private schools is much greater, reaching 38.41 per 
‘cent, while in the higher education 64.61 per cent of the pupils are in 
private institutions, and only 35.39 per cent in: State universities and 
normal schools. The private schools enroll nearly one-sixth of the 
pupils in the North Atlantic division of States (including New England, 
New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania), but only one-fourteenth of 
the pupils in the Southern and Western States, and less than one-tenth 
of all the pupils in the nation. As I remarked in my last report, the 
private school assists the public school in the way of making useful 
educational experiments, and in providing a safeguard against a par- 
simonious management on the part of public school directors. When 
teachers’ wages are reduced private schools increase in number and 
excellence, and a healthy reaction sets in on the part of the-friends of 
free schools. 
Moreover, acertain proportion of the children of the community have, 
or are supposed by their parents to have, need of special concessions 
either in regard to regularity of attendance, hours of schooling, course 
of study, or methods of instruction, and these pupils often find their 
requirements met in private schools. I have pointed out elsewhere 
that a certain proportion of private schools, say from 5 to 15 per cent 
of the whole teaching force, is desirable for the best progress of the 
whole school system. The pride of the public school system is its cul- 
ivation of the virtues of regularity, punctuality, self-control, and 
industry; its thoroughness of instruction and its democratic association 
of rich and poor, of high and low in the same school. But its danger 
lies in the direction of too much mechanism. In its school discipline 
this is generally healthy unless secured by harsh punishment; but in 
the matter of instruction it is sometimes an overcultivation of the verbal 
memory and a corresponding neglect of the more human training in 
power of thinking, the taste for literature and art, and the ability to 
make the most of the gifts peculiar to the individual pupil. 
The private school sometimes discovers and develops better methods 
in these particulars, and the teachers of the public schools profit by 
adopting them. Especially is this the case in that feature of work 
called “thoroughness.” It is often the case that pupils who have 
mastered the new thought of a study and gained all that it gives in the 
» way of culture or mental nourishment are kept back in their course of 
study for the sake of more drill in mechanical accuracy in details. 
It will be seen on the inspection of school programmes that pupils are 
sometimes kept five years on studies that can not nourish the mind of 
youth for more than three or four years. The elementary course is 
lengthened out to nine or ten years when pupils would do much better
-P-A-G-E-13
REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. xur 
to take up secondary studies after seven or eight years devoted to 
elementary studies. In these matters the private school is apt to make 
the opposite mistake, it is true, and begin the secondary studies before 
the pupil has a sufficient acquaintance with elementary work. In the 
former case the pupil is deadened by too much mechanical perfection 
in dealing with details; in the latter case he is discouraged by attempt- 
ing subjects too difficult for him t6 grasp. 
  LENGLH OF SCHOOL YEAR, 
The average Jength of the annual school term increases with the 
growth of cities. In the North Atlantic Division the average length of 
the last scholastic year was 169.1 days of actual school sessions. In the 
South Central Division (including the Gulf States and containing few 
cities) the average annual term was 94.5 days. The average for the 
whole country was 137.1 days, the same being an increase from 132.1 
. days in 1870-71. The average length of annual term isslowly approach- 
ing 200 days, which is the maximum length of the school year accord- 
ing to present opinion. 
TOTAL AMOUNT OF SCHOOLING, PER CITIZEN, AT PRESENT RATES. 
In the table showing the actual average amount of attendance on 
school in the public schools (Table No. 8, p. 46) it is seen that the total 
number of days’ attendance reported for the year is 1,172,261,842, or an 
average of 88.8 days apiece for the 13,205,877 pupils enrolled. In my 
report for 1889-90 I showed that at the present rates of attendance 
each inhabitant is receiving an average of four and three-tenths years’ 
schooling, counting full years of two hundred days each, the ratio for 
each section of the country being as follows (counting both public and 
private schools):

But it should be mentioned that the above estimate does not take 
into consideration the fact that the proportions of children and 
adults vary largely in the different sections. In former reports (for | 
1888 and for 1889) these variations have been fully discussed. The 
school population of six to fourteen years was on the average for the 
whole country and its divisions according to the census of 1880 as 
follows for each 100 of population : ~/ 2.52

XIV REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
If these proportions are considered, the average length of school life of 
_ the population will be increased for the Western Division, which shows 
a disproportionally small number of children in its population owing to. 
the fact that, being newly settled, there are fewer families than in older 
settled parts of the country. According to the estimate based simply 
on the average number of days’ schooling each child of the ages 5 to 
18 years gets in the several States (see discussion of Table VIII, p. 51), 
omitting the private schools from calculations, each inhabitant receives 
3.66 years of 200 days for the United States, 4.71 for the North Atlantic, 
2.28 for the South Atlantic, 2.22 for the South Central, 4.38 for the 
North Central, 4.08 for the Western. 
This estimate takes into account the variations in the proportions of 
children of school age in the entire population. 
CLASSIFICATION BY SEX. 
While the elementary schools show a somewhat larger number of 
boys in attendance, the secondary schools show 53.9 per cent of girls, 
or 216,658 girls to 185,431 boys. Of these the public high schools 
report 147,162 girls to 100,498 boys and the private academies and 
seminaries 69,496 girls to 84,933 boys. The institutions of higher edu- 
eation report 23,360 female students and 49,100 male students in col- 
leges and universities, 26,725 female and 12,412 male students in the 
normal schools. The ratio of women to men in higher education is 
changing from year to year in favor of the former. The coeducational 
colleges and universities enroll 10,846 female students, while the col- 
leges for women enroll 12,514, 
TEACHERS. 
  The number of teachers in the public schools is reported at 374,460, 
of whom 252,822, or 67.5 per cent, are women. In 1870-71 the per- 
centage of male teachers was 41; nine years later (1879-80) it was 
42.8; ten years later (1889-99) it had fallen to 34.5. 
SCHOOL EXPENDITURES. 
The total expenditure for public schools is reported at $155,991,273, 
the same being an increase of $9,191,110 over the year preceding. Of 
this sum $100,333,071 went for the payment of salaries of teachers and 
superintendents. The average expenditure per pupil was $14.80, not 
counting the expenditures for new buildings. :

The statistics published in this and preceding annual reports are 
obtained partly from direct returns made to the Bureau from the super- 
intendents of States and cities and the heads of institutions, and partly 
by compilation from printed reports. The schedules sent out annually

number of returns made the past year was 7,483, but in order toobtain 
this number an average of three schedules were mailed to each party 
who reported. The following exhibit shows the titles of these sched-

The statistical division of the Bureau, besides tabulating the returns 
from the schedules, examines and compares the published reports of 
State and city school systems, the catalogues, yearbooks, and manuals 
of the several kinds of educational institutions. The division of for- 
eign exchange studies the official reports on foreign systems and all 
the books published by investigators on those systems, whether in Eng- 
lish of in other languages. 
Besides the twenty-four regular annual schedules mentioned above, 
the Bureau undertakes each year some one or more extra inquiries, pub- 
lishing the results either in the annual report or in a separate circular 
of information. Examples of this are the chapter on “kindergartens,” 
published in the report of last year (1890-91); also the report on legal 
education in the different countries of the world, and the report show- 
ing all public libraries of over one thousand volumes, prepared by the 
statistical division and published as a separate circular of information. 
To some extent special inquiries by clerks detailed from the office 
are made, as, forexample, those into art and industrial instruction by

ology by Dr. Arthur MacDonald. 
It has been the practice of the Bureau since the begining to obtain 
from experts special treatises on various topics of interest as they 
awaken public inquiry. 
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
France.—In Chapter III (pp. 73-96) a brief survey is given of the 
educational system of France, abridged from the more extended study 
made in a preyious report. To this is appended an account of the 
important operations of the year 1892. France, since it began the 
work of educating the whole people, has been a profitable object lesson 
for the study of methods of organization, instruction, and course of 
study. There is no field on which a more interesting experiment is in 
progress. Will the universal education of the people develop local 
centers of self-government, or are the course of study and the methods 
employed such as to make it a second nature for the inhabitants of the 
provinces to look to Paris for each and every initiative? It is interest- 
ing to note in this connection (p. 91) that the provincial centers now 
show 13,287 university students, while Paris has only 10,110, whereas 
Paris had the larger number five years before. 
The history of education in China shows that a nation may have a~ 
universal system of school education and yet develop little or no local 
self-government. If the memory is the chief faculty cultivated, and 
the course of study includes little else besides the sacred codes of 
morals and religion, the result is to fill the mind with the traditional 
forms of thinking and acting. Whence it results that the child learns 
to think and act and to take precisely the view of the world that his 
fathers took before him. The more education in Confucius and Men- 
cius the more safely conservative will be the life of each new inhabi- 
tant in China. But on the other hand, let the child start in a kinder. 
garten and develop self-activity along all the lines of his character; let 
him continue his studies in the primary and grammar schools, cultivating 
the habits of observation and scientific investigation; let him keep 
abreast with scientific research; let him have access to the literature of 
the world, and he will find a constant stimulus toward freedom and 
local self-government; toward emancipation from authority. 
The fact that France lays great stress on scientific methods in its 
schools, therefore, goes to show that the universal education there in 
progress is an education that moves toward decentralization. The 
influence of Paris will now help emancipate the provinces, and each 
other city in France will develop within itself its own Paris. Mean- 
while Paris will grow all the more in its influence on the world as one 
of the three great modern civilizing powers. 
Great Britain and Ireland.—In Chapter IV is given a brief survey of 
education in England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, supplementary to
-P-A-G-E-17
  
REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. XVII 
statements printed in the report of 1888-89, in which the system of 
England, and the report of 1889-90, in which that of Scotland, were 
presented historically. In 1891 school fees were remitted in the Goy- 
ernment elementary schools. The statistics of the past year show an 
increase of attendance due to this fact, and the elementary schools of 
England now enroll 17.13 per cent of the population. The number 
of schools under municipal school boards has increased, and they now 
enroll 40 per cent of all pupils. The private and parochial schools still 
enroll 60 per cent, while the private and parochial schools in the United 
States enroll only 10 per cent of the pupils. 
The struggle of the friends of the parochial schools will doubtless 
have a purifying and beneficial effect on the management of schools 
under public-school boards. The fire of opposition saves much waste- 
ful experiment by exposing the weak features of a system in advance 
of the actual trial by experiment. In England the old challenges the 
new and pours upon it a storm of ridicule; points out its inconsistencies 
and want of logic; praises the good old way; foresees the dreadful con- 
sequences to church and state of the new plans if carried out. Sucha 
winnowing of a new scheme lets through only the best and wisest 
features, and the progress is continuous if slow. There is much less of 
the pendulum movement in English reform, less swinging from one 
extreme to another, which “marks time,” but does not march. 
Meanwhile, an equal amount of interest exists for us in the course of 
study and methods of instruction pursued in English schools but not 
the same kind of interest that we found in those of France. English- 
speaking peoples have for centuries insisted on local self-government. 
We donot feel so anxious to see the modes by which English schools secure 
independence and freedom of local centers as to see how they correct ten- 
dencies to extreme individualism and provincialism. What place does 
English literature hold in the education of English and Irish and Scotch 
youth? There are more first-class poets in England at the present time 
than inall therestof Europe, and the total roll of its poets and dramatists 
of high order of merit is also greater than that of the rest of Europe. 
The social and political atmosphere of this people, with its national 
idiosyncrasy tending to personal adventure and local self-government, 
seems to favor the evolution of poets. The poet makes public opinion 
by uttering his view of the world in beautiful forms of speech and can- 
vassing the grounds and motives that tell in its favor. An education 
in the national poetry of England therefore furnishes the needed uni- 
fying influence for its adventure-seeking people. They form, whether 
in Great Britain or in English-speaking colonies, a nation whose rule is 
chiefly that of public opinion, fed by the national poets and novelists, 
and expressed in its organ, the daily newspaper. 
It is of interest to note that the enrollment of children in the schools 
of Ireland slightly exceeds that of England, being 17.34 per cent of the 
population. Here the same investigation, as to the course of study and

  methods of instruction, is necessary in order to answer the question 
whether this system of universal education is to settle the Irish politi- 
eal problem. 
Chapter V gives a summary of the reports on technical instruction in 
Great Britain, showing the status of the great movement inaugurated 
after the first world’s fair, when English statesmen learned that certain 
other countries surpassed their own in the artistic finish of goods. 
Germany, Austria, Switzerland.—In Chapter VI the present opera- 
tions of the schools for training teachers in the German speaking 
nations are discussed in the light of their history. Much interesting mat- 
ter is to be found in the courses of study of those institutions. 
In Chapter VIL an historical and statistical review is given of the 
Swiss school system. In Chapter VIII is an interesting study of the 
schools of Vienna as regards the home influences of 9,000 children aged 
from 10 to 14. The article is translated from Franz Schoberle and is a 
contribution to the vast subject of child-study now gaining so large a 
place in educational literature. In last year’s report I printed Dr. 
Francis Warner’s studies made on 50,000 children of the London schools 
in respect to physical and mental condition, a noteworthy contribution 
to this same subject of child-study. In Chapter IX (pp. 239-246) are to 
be found notes on school museums in various parts of the world. Inas- 
much as no complete list has been printed of such museums, contribu- 
tions to such a list are desired. In Chapter X is given a translation 
of a remarkable article on the character and historical development of. 
the German universities by Professor Paulsen, of Berlin, supplemented 
by a statistical review of the subject by Professor Conrad, of Halle. 
It is one of the noblest contributions made to the Columbian Exposition. 
The civil service in France and Prussia.—Chapter XI contains the 
results of a special investigation made by experts for the Bureau into 
the schools for recruiting the civil services in France, and an account of 
the civil service requirements in Prussia. Prussia and France stand 
in the foremost rank of the world for the perfection of their civil serv- 
ice. In the infancy of our American system we naturally have much 
to learn from them in this particular. Prof. Herbert B. Adams’s excel- 
lent suggestion of an academy in Washington for the training of can- 
didates for civil service, is given a place in this chapter (pp. 410-412). . 
-. A brief survey of the education of Sweden, together with some 
account of current operations, is given in Chapter XII. 
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
In Chapter XIII is given an historical sketch of physical training, 
together with a careful study of the systems in use in this country, 
namely, the Swedish, the German, Dr. Sargent’s, and that of Delsarte.

gymnasiums, and tabular views showing the statistics of physical train- 
ing in the city schools of the United States.

REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. xIxX 
Iam not convinced that the present theory of physical education, as 
taught in the schools, gives enough weight to the bodily conditions that 
favor the restoration of nervous energy. 
It is well known that physical exercise affects directly the muscular 
system, and that the muscular system is not all of the body, nor, indeed, 
itself directly the generator of what I have called nervous energy. 
There is a nutritive process of digestion and a distributive process of 
circulation through the heart and lungs and liver, the two forming a 
building-up function which restores, repairs, and increases the organism 
and removes the waste. There is, besides, a nervous organism which 
receives impressions from without and sends out impulses that react 
on the environment. 
Physical training, as we understand it, deals directly and chiefly with 
the muscular system and with that part of the nervous system which 
conveys impulses from the brain outward through the limbs to the 
environment. Physical exercise indirectly acts on the digestion and the 
circulatory system and on the nerves of sensation, and its relation to 
those other bodily functions is nearly or quite as important as the direct 
relation of exercise to the muscles and the acquiring of strength. 
During the first fifty years of agitation on the subject of bodily train- 
ing, connected with the rise of Turner societies in Germany and the 
preaching of the gospel of bodily culture as auxiliary to intellect and 
will by Spurzheim, his disciple, George Combe, and their numerous 
followers, we may say without hesitation that the doctrine of phys- 
ical exercise was passing through its stage of superstition and quackery. 
There was a sharp dividing line between the believers in hygiene and 
the old school of physicians, and this separation led quite naturally to 
dismal results. The doctors opposed with blind conservatism the 
new apostles, and the latter justified the attitude of the former by a 
radicalism equally blind and fanatical. 
It is the glory of the present revival of physical exercise that it is 
led by educated physicians. It is a new movement of the highest 
importance, the establishment of a resident physician in each of our 
colleges as supervisor of gymnastics and recording inspector of phys- 
ical development among the students. It means a synthesis of science 
with reform and the end of the era of quackery in hygiene. 
But it is not.something that can be matured all at once.. There is a 
fringe of the old fanaticism which still attaches to the new movement, 
and consequently an unreasonable conservatism, which is the result of 
a reaction against obvious quackery. The regular medical directors of 
physical exercise are reducing their observations to a statistical form, 
and are rejecting many of the principles supposed to be fixed in former 
times. They are dispelling many old illusions. They are widening 
the survey of effects direct and indirect. Already we are beginning to 
have a harvest of treatises which record the more scientific observations. 
The old athletism in a college produced a small quota of splendidly
-P-A-G-E-20
= XxX REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
trained bodies. The majority of the students made but little progress. 
Their exercise consisted for the most part in sitting on the damp ground 
(or ona dry fence) and seeing the picked men of their classes engage in 
a violent contest for mastery. Athletics was rather a system of elimi- 
nating the weak and of selecting the already strong for the contests at 
ball or boating. Even in the gymnasium it was the strong who held 
outand continued to practice the exercises. Buta system that selected 
the already strong rather than transformed the weak into the strong 
was only a sham for physical education. That sham is now in process 
of removal by the substituting of special courses of exercise provided 
by the medical gymnasiarch for each individual after special diagnosis. 
The athlete theory of gymnastics was a sort of survival of the old 
Greek and Roman customs, It was not realized that the Greeks and 
Romans attached not so much a hygienic value to athletics as a reli- 
gious significance. The Greeks celebrated their worship of physical 
beauty, the gods of Olympus, by their games, and the Romans equally 
celebrated, not beauty, but self-sacrifice by their sports in the arena. 
The Greeks conceived the divine as a god-like control of the body by 
the mind in such a form as to produce gracefulness of carriage. The 
Roman worshipped the political state as the incarnation of the divine, 
and celebrated it by spectacles of self-sacrifice wherein human gladi- 
ators contended in the death struggle with each other or with wild 
beasts. This symbolized for him the struggle within each citizen who 
sacrificed his life or property for the safety or advancement of Rome. 
Careless readers of history may suppose that all nations have culti- 
vated bodily perfection in the same way as the Greeks and Romans, and 
for the same ends. But it is not so. The savage tribes seek skill in 
war by physical training, while we seek to increase the healthful gen- 
eration of nervous energy. But many Asiatic nations have, for religious 
reasons, opposed physical culture as something leading to evil—as, for 
example, the Hindoos and the Buddhists, 
The Hindoo worshipped an abstract unity, devoid of all form, which 
he called Brahma. His idea of the divine is defined as the negation 
not only of everything in nature, but also everything human. Nothing 
that has form, or shape, or properties, or qualities—nothing, in short, 
that can be distinguished from anything else, can be divine according 
to the thought of the Hindoo. This is a pantheism that worships a 
negative might which destroys everything. 
If it admits that the world of finite things arises from Brahma as 
creator, it hastens to tell us that creation is only a dream, and that 
all creatures will vanish when the dream fades. There can be no hope 
for any individuality, according to this belief. Any art that grows up 
under such a religion will manifest only the nothingness of individual- 
ity, and the impossibility of its salvation. Instead of beauty as the 
attribute of divinity, the Hindoo studies to mortify the flesh; to shrivel 
up the body; to paralyze rather than to develop his muscles. Instead

of gymnastic festivals, he resorted to the severest penances, such as 
holding his arm over his head until it wasted away. If he could pro- 
duce numbness in his body so that all feeling disappeared, he attained 
holiness. His divine was not divine-human, but inhuman rather. 
But opposed to this oriental idea, the Greek religion made beauty the 
essential feature of the idea of the divine, and hence his art is created 
as an act of worship of the beautiful, It represents the supreme attain- 
ment of the world in pure beauty, because it is pure beauty and noth- 
ing beyond. Christianity reaches beyond beauty to holiness. Other 
heathen religions fall short of the Greek idea, and lack an essential ele- 
ment which the Greek religion possessed. The Greeks believed that 
the divine is at the same time human; and human notin the sense that 
the essence of man, his purified intellect and will, is divine, but human 
in the corporeal sense as well. 
The gods of Olympus were thought to possess appetites and passions 
like men; to have bodies and live in a special place. They formed a 
society, or large patriarchal family. The manifestation of the divine 
was seen in celestial beauty. Moreover, it was supposed that the human 
being may, by becoming beautiful, become divine. Hence the Greek 
religion centered about gymnastic games. These were the Olympian, 
the Isthmian, the Nemean, and the Pythian games. Exercises that 
shall give the soul sovereignty over the body and develop it into beauty 
are religious in this sense. Every village had its games for physical 
development; these were attended by the people, who became, in time, 
judges of perfection in human form, just as a community that attends 
frequent horse races produces men that know critically the good points 
of a horse. It was known who was the best man at wrestling, boxing, 
throwing the discus, the spear, or javelin; at running, at leaping, or 
at the chariot and the horseback races. 
Then, at less frequent intervals, there was the contest at games 
between neighboring villages. The successful hero carried off the 
crown of wild olive branches. Nearly every year there was a great 
national assembly of Greeks, and a contest open to all. The Olympian 
festival at Olympia and the Isthmian festival, near Corinth, were held 
the same summer; then at Argolis, in the winter of the second year 
afterward, was the Nemean festival, the Pythian festival near Delphi, 
and a second Isthmian festival occurred in the spring of the third year, 
and again a second Nemean festival in the summer of the fourth year 
of the Olympiad. The entire people, composed of independent states, 
united by ties of religion, assembled to celebrate this faith in the beau. 
tiful, and honor their successful youths. The results carried the 
national taste for the beautiful, as seen in the human body, to the 
highest degree. 
The next step after the development of the personal work of art in 
the shape of beautiful youth, by means of the national games and the 
cultivation of the taste of the entire people through the spectacle of
-P-A-G-E-22
    XXII REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
these games, was the art of sculpture, by which these forms of beauty, 
realized in the athletes and existing in the minds of the people as ideals 
of correct taste, were fixed in stone and set up in the temples for 
worship. Thus Greek art was born. The statues at first were of gods 
and demigods exclusively. Those which have come down to us cause 
our unbounded astonishment at their perfection of form. Itisnottheir 
resemblance to living bodies, not their anatomical exactness, that inter- 
ests us, not their so-called “truth to nature,” but their gracefulness and 
serenity—their ‘classic repose.” Whether the statues represent gods 
and heroes in action or in sitting and reclining postures, there is this 
“repose,” which means indwelling vital activity, and not mere rest as 
opposed to moyement. In the greatest activity there is considerate 
purpose and perfect self-control manifested. The repose is of the soul, 
and not a physical repose. Even sitting and reclining figures—for 
example, the Theseus from the Parthenon, the torso of the Belvidere— 
are filled with activity, so that the repose is one of voluntary self 
restraint and not the repose of the absence of vital energy. They are 
gracefulness itself. 
Modern civilization has adopted from the Hebrew “chosen people” 
the idea of holiness; from the Greek the idea of beauty; from the 
Roman the idea of a social or civil whole as state and nation, as municipal 
corporation, and as free association—and it unites these ideas and 
subordinates each to a higher ideal. Even the Hebrew idea of holi- 
ness is subordinated to the Christian ideal of divine charity in the service 
of humanity. We do not approve the sacrifice of the higher interests 
of the soul for the beauty of the body; nor for the needs of military 
service; nor for the theatrical display of strength in brutal contests. 
We regard physical exercise as desirable for the increase of nervous 
energy, to be expended for rational spiritual purposes. 
Our civilization is so bent on the conquest of nature and the produe- 
tion of wealth that it perpetually strains its supply of nervous energy 
and produces disaster. Here is the special problem of our time for 
hygiene to meet, How to restore and conserve nervous energy? 
There are three factors here: First, the one of food and its proper 
assimilation; second, the factor of rest and sleep; third, the factor of 
exercise—muscular and mental. It is obvious enough that digestion 
requires nervous energy just as muscular and mental labor does, 
Hence, digestion must be given time. It must not be encroached on by 
bodily exercise, or by mental exercise. But what is the average amount 
of time required for this, and should it be total cessation from bodily 
and mental labor, or is light labor of both or either best for the diges- 
tive process? 
Here our quantitative tables and the observations of our medical 
directors are to give us the true answer; not abstract, general answers 
like those old dogmatic answers, but definite answers, qualified to suit 
different temperaments and abounding with tests easily applied by

each individual. It is necessary to have the directions so specific that 
inexperienced youth will not err in their application. This is an age of 
self-educated men. ‘The printed page is the means of such education. 
It is all the more necessary to surround new departures with the safe- 
guards of printed rules and cautions. 
If the chapters could be written which describe the grave mistakes 
committed by amateurs in the use of physical exercise as a hygienic 
measure, they would furnish a sufficient warning for the present gen. 
eration. They would describe various experiments of using midnight 
hours for walks and rides in the open air—the student used all his 
day for intellectual work and supposed that an hour or two of exercise 
taken at a late hour of the night-would answer his needs. Another 
experiment selected its period of exercise in the early morning, cur- 
tailing the period of sleep in order to secure the requisite time before 
breakfast. Violent physical exercise taken early in the morning is 
very exhaustive of nervous energy, and probably in most instances the 
student has cultivated nervous dyspepsia quite as much as he has eul- 
tivated his muscles. We have all read in the biography and autobi- 
ography of Thomas Carlyle the mention of his walks and horseback rides 
late in the night. Everyone has had something of this kind in his own 
experience or in the experience of persons of his acquaintance. A dis- 
tinguished laborer in the cause of education told lately his own follies 
in this matter. Led on by reading injudicious writings on this subject 
of hygiene, he had so curtailed his night’s rest for the sake of morning 
exercise that nervous collapse resulted. His physician prescribed as 
the only possible remedy a long period of total rest. The hours of 
sleep at night were nearly doubled and a relaxation from study in the 
daytime was insisted upon. Relief came as a consequence. 
Besides this mistake of cutting off the sleeping hours at the begin- 
ning or at the end for the sake of physical exercise, there is an equally 
harmful mistake of bringing the hour of exercise close to the hours for 
meals. Just preceding or just succeeding a meal, any exercise of a suffi- 
ciently energetic character to cause the blood to leave the organs of 
digestion and fill the muscles of the body or the brain is injurious and 
tends to produce dyspepsia. The stomach needs the greater share of 
the nervous energy and likewise of the arterial circulation. Dr. Sargent 
thinks that violent exercise should not be taken at a period so long as 
three hours after a meal, on account of the danger of faintness, which 
neutralizes the good results of such exercise. Provided the person has 
just taken violent exercise, the blood is diverted to the muscles and 
brain and away from the stomach. The taking of food at this time, 
when the nervous system is depleted of its vitality, is considered unfavor- 
able to the best action of the digestive functions. * 
It must be admitted, too, that cold bathing, which has been so often 
commended with a great lack of discrimination, is another source of 
injury to the health when it is resorted to by persons with nervous tem-

peraments or feeble constitutions, and at a time when the system has 
been depleted of its vital energy by work or exercise, or when the 
digestive organs are occupied with recently taken food. 
The old rule, made by a farmer population to encourage early ris- 
ing, which mentions, as its effect, health, wealth, and wisdom has 
made mischief with conscientious students who have supposed that 
. early rising is in itself a good thing, even when not preceded by the 
precaution named in the adage, namely, “early to bed.” It is a very 
important matter to consider that physical exercise has its best effect 
when it is carried on socially in the form of plays and games or con- 
tests with one’s fellows. The stimulus which is derived from emula- 
tion and interest in one’s fellow students has to be compensated for by 
a sheer exertion of the will in the case of calisthenic exercises and in 
the case of prescribed athletic training by the use of weights, ladders, 
and the other machines of the gymnasium. 
The object of gymnastic training, it has been said often enough, is 
to put the will into the muscles. It is to give one such control over all 
his muscles that each act performed by the body is performed by the 
use of all the muscles which nature has provided for the purpose. The 
farmer or the blacksmith develops a few muscles and neglects others. 
The gymnasium is supposed to cultivate many muscles which remain 
rudimentary in the original man; and here, I think, is an item of com- 
pensation which makes up for a great deal of the deleterious results 
coming to the imprudent gymnast who is careless about the hygienic 
precautions just now mentioned in relation to eating and sleeping. 
The gymnast—and I mean by the gymnast one who has taken suffi- 
ciently violent exercise to develop to a considerable degree the muscles 
of the chest, back, arms, and the other limbs—the gymnast has acquired 
the power of putting his will into his muscles by a slight effort. The 
gymnast performs all slight bodily actions—such as rising from a chair, 
sitting down, walking, climbing stairs, swinging his arms, turning his 
head, everything, in short, that he does with his body—by using many 
more muscles than the untrained person uses. Hence, it happens that 
one who has taken gymnastic exercise retains till old age the power of 
getting a maximum of exercise out of a minimum of bodily movement. 
Walking afew rods and running up and down stairs two or three times 
a day gives him as much exercise as the average farmer gets from two 
hours of farm work. 
It is most important to note that gymnastic and calisthenic training, 
so called, are violent demands upon the will power and a rapid drain 
of the nervous energy. Hence, physical exercise directly after a hard 
lesson is not a proper sequence. The will power which has been drained 
by the mental work is reduced to complete exhaustion by violent 
physical exercise. 
“Every pound of energy expended on work, either of mind or of 
body,” says Dr. Sargent, ‘must be made good by food, rest, or sleep.”
-P-A-G-E-25
  
  REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. XXV 
Severe mental work can not be compensated for by severe physical 
work. It is rest for the will which is required, and the will is rested 
not by a new tension of its exercise, but by a state of collapse such as 
comes when caprice and arbitrariness and the yielding to one’s humor 
succeeds the tension of work. . Plato’s description of the Greek athletes, 
stupid and lazy fellows, who did nothing but eat and sleep, describes 
the condition of rest after severe physical exercise, and still more the 
true condition of rest of the intellectual athlete after severe mental 
exercise. 
I have here enumerated some of the results of injudicious physical 
exercise. The effects of judicious exercise are those which are usually 
described in works of hygiene and physical training. I quote an 
enumeration of them from Dr. Ray Lankester to show how simple the 
whole matter looks when the precautions are omitted. Nearly all 
things seem simple when taken out of their relation to their environ- 
‘ment. He says: 
The employment of the muscles in exercise not only benefits their especial 
structure, but acts on the whole system. When the muscles are put in action the 
capillary blood vessels with which they are supplied become more rapidly charged 
with blood, and active changes take place, not only in the muscles but in all the 
surrounding tissues. The heart is required to supply more blood, and accordingly 
beats more rapidly in order to meet the demand. A large quantity of blood is sent 
through the lungs, and larger supplies of oxygen are taken in and carried to the 
various tissues. The oxygen, by combining with the carbon of the blood and the 
tissues, engenders a larger quantity of heat, which produces an action on the skin, 
in order that the superfluous warmth may be disposed of. The skin is thus exercised, 
as it were, and the sudoriparous and sebaceous glands are set at work. Tho lungs 
and skin are brought into operation, and the lungs throw off large quantities of 
*water containing in solution matters which, if retained, would produce disease in 
the body. Wherever the blood is sent, changes of a healthful character oceur. The 
brain and the rest of the nervous system are invigorated, the stomach has its powers 
of digestion improved, and the liver, pancreas, and other organs perform their 
functions with more vigor. By want of exercise the constituents of the food which 
pass into the blood are not oxidized, and products which produce disease are engen- 
dered, The introduction of fresh supplies of oxygen induced by exercise oxidizes 
these products and renders them harmless, All other things being the same, it may 
be laid down as arule that those who take the most exercise in the open air will 
live longest. 
But. the student who reads of these direct effects without, at the 
same time, carefully learning the indirect effects on digestion and sleep 
and mental work or worry will be likely to neutralize all the good 
that comes from physical exercise. 
The teacher who, full of faith in calisthenic exercise, thinks to do 
away with the old-fashioned recess and to gain a positive benefit by 
physical training, will fall into serious errors. A consideration of the 
conditions of the problem will show this. Within the school the pupil 
is supposed to be under a severe strain of discipline and attention to 
study. Regularity, punctuality, silence, conformity to rules as to 
sitting or standing, strict self-control on the part of the pupil, and a
-P-A-G-E-26
  
  XXVL REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
forced attention to his lesson, or to the recitation of his fellow-pupils, 
or to the explanations of his teacher—all this produces a great tension 
of physical and mental powers. If it were continued too long, con- 
gestion would be produced, affecting the heart or brain or digestive 
functions, or some local nerve center. Past experience, noting this fact, 
has endeavored to avoid the danger by establishing the interval of rest 
and recreation known as the “ recess.” 
The pupils are all dismissed from the school building and removed 
from the school restraints for an interval of a few minutes, The pupil 
leaves. the close air of the schoolroom and rushes out into the pure 
air, suddenly relieved from the cramp of muscles in sitting in a partie- 
ular position on a hard seat, and relieved likewise from the cramp of 
nervous energy that has been diverted from natural functions of diges- 
tion, circulation, and secretion, and concentrated on the conscious pro- 
cesses of attention and obedience to the external commands of the 
teacher or to his own self-imposed industry. 
The chief use of the “recess” is its complete suspension of tension of 
will power and the surrender to caprice for a brief interval. Any form 
of calisthenics or gymnastic exercise is therefore a diversion of the 
recess from its normal function. It is the substitution of one kind of 
tension of the will for another. The tension of the will requisite to 
perform properly the requirements of school discipline and instruction 
is such as to withdraw the nervous energy from those great centers of 
secretion and circulation, stomach, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs. Conges- 
tion, as before said, is easily initiated, and if continued will produce 
functional derangements connected with the organs of digestion and 
circulation. The seeds of indigestion, renal weakness, liver complaint, 
constipation, even of fearful scourges like Bright’s disease, may be 
sown in the system in early years by injudicious confinement in the 
schoolroom. 
The great physical need of the pupil is relaxation. The pupil needs 
to stretch his cramped muscles and send the blood in torrents through 
his limbs, which have become torpid with disuse. The pupil is in want 
of fresh air and of the deep inflation of the lungs that exercise in the 
open air gives. He ought to use his voice, too. The reformers propose 
to substitute light exercises called “calisthenics” for the purpose of 
supplying all these wants. They will throw open the windows and let. 
in fresh air; they will have a system of well-devised movements which 
will give the needed circulation of the blood, ete. 
Calisthenic exercise serves a good place in the schoolroom, but its 
most important function is not a physiological one. It is true that the: 
blood is caused to circulate more vigorously through the limbs and: 
those parts of the body that have become partly torpid with sitting or 
standing still. But the chief demand upon the pupil in calisthenics is 
the requirement to strain his attention and exercise his will. It isa 
will training to a greater extent than a physiological training. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-27

great distinction between work and play is this one: In play, the mind 
is spontaneous, governed entirely by its own individuality; in work, 
the will power is exercised to conform its individuality to some exter- 
nally prescribed course of action. Calisthenic exercise is severe work, 
and not by any means a relaxation. But the child needs relaxation 
and not merely a change of work, although the change is of some ben- 
efit. Exercise of the limbs, in accordance with a prescribed formula, 
is not the thing that nature requires. 
The child has been exercising his will in the four directions of sclf- 
control: To be regular, punctual, silent, and industrious; now giving 
his attention to the mastery of some subject by himself, and anon, fol- 
lowing with alertness and critical acumen the recitation of some fellow- 
pupil, or some explanation or direction by the teacher. Calisthenics 
does not afford relief to the will power. We have seen that all exer- 
cise of the will, in the act of fixed and unremitting attention, has a pow- 
erful influence over the digestive, circulatory, and secretory functions 
of the body. This influence, if not intermitted, will cause derangement 
of thesefunctions. A runin the open air, a saunter at will, or a vigorous 
game with. one’s fellows, free from restraint or authority—any exercise, 
in short, of the spontaneous choice of the pupil, will give this desirable 
relief to the lungs, the heart, the stomach, the glands, and the ganglia. 
Our medical advisers who supervise gymnastic exercises are in pro- 
cess of correcting the evils and extending the benefits of physical edu- 
cation. Their best service is to be along the line of enlightening the 
student who is on the verge (or beyond the verge) of nervous prostra- * 
tion how to build anew his nerves. For they will teach him the fane- 
tion of sleep and amusement; of rest before and after meals; of the 
danger of following a mental strain of the will by another strain of the 
will directed to the muscles; of the danger of exercise late at night; 
of the danger of tobacco and alcoholic liquors. We shall have science 
instead of quackery. These good things belong mostly to the physical 
education of the future. - 
THE AGE OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
In Chapter XVI I print a valuable essay of Prof. C. M. Woodward, 
of St. Louis, on the method of ascertaining the average age of with- 
drawal from public schools. 
CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS, 
At the present time there is much inquiry for literature on the sub- 
ject of grading in city schools and the proper length of class intervals. 
I have brought together in Chapter XV several discussions written on 
the advantages and defects of the graded system, and especially 
concerning the importance.of classifying with short intervals between 
classes in order to render possible frequent promotions of those pupils 
making the most rapid progre&s.

  SUMMER SCHOOLS, ETO. 
In Chapter X XIX I have printed a history of summer schools in 
the United States prepared especially for this Bureau by Dr. W. W. 
Willoughby. In recent years the summer school has become a very 
important means of extending school and university advantages to 
adult persons. 
State university organization.—In Chapter XXII I have presented 
an important suggestion of Dr. 8. S. Laws, formerly president of the 
State University of Missouri, looking toward the federation of the 
colleges or universities of a State under the leadership of a State uni- 
versity. It seems possible that this idea may be adopted in some of 
our States to great advantage. 
West Point Military School.—An excellent article on our national 
Military School at West Point is found in Chapter XXIV. It was pre- 
pared by Prof. E. 8. Holden, of Lick Observatory. 
Truants and incorrigibles.—In Chapter XXV I print one of the most 
thoughtful and wise articles yet written on the care of truants and 
incorrigibles, prepared by the superintendent of city schools, Boston, 
Mass. 
Education in Alaska.—In Chapter XXVIII Dr. Sheldon Jackson, 
the United States general agent for education in Alaska, reports the 
work of the year for that Territory. He gives an account of the first 
trip to Siberia for the purchase of reindeer.

GENERAL CLASSIFIED SUMMARY OF PUPILS OF ALL 
GRADES, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS 
AND INSTITUTIONS. 
  
General table—Per tent of the population under instruction—Also of the school popula- 
tion— Proportion of each grade of instruction, and of public and private instruction— 
Higher students and population compared—Distribution of students in professional 
schools—Sex of secondary pupils and of college students—Female college students 
compared with the population—Proportion in each class of institutions—Normal 
school pupils. 
The following table (Table 1) gives the number of pupils of all grades 
in the United States,* classified according to grade of instruction im- 
parted, instead of according to the character of institution attended. 
Thus, all secondary pupils in colleges have been classed as secondary; 
and all elementary pupils as elementary, even though attending (in 
the “preparatory” department) an institution of secondary grade. 
The statistics of private elementary education have never been com- 
pletely gathered, and the figures in Column 3 are, therefore, largely 
estimated; they are known to be much less than the facts would war- 
rant, and should possibly be increased as much as 50 per cent. The 
returns of pupils receiving secondary instruction, both public and pri- 
vate, are also incomplete. 
  
*Excluding in general evening schools; art, industrial training, trades, and pri- 
vate business schools; schools for the defective, dependent, and delinquent classes, 
and Indian schools. These collectively enroll a considerable number of pupils.

    4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
WHERE THE SECONDARY PUPILS ARE FOUND. 
In the following table (Table 2) the secondar, 'y pupils are classified 
according to the character of the institution attended. ‘ 
It will be seen from the table that there are comparatively few public 
secondary pupils outside of the common schools (i. e., in public univer- 
sities, ete.), the proportion of such being only about 3 per cent of the 
publig secondary pupils. In fact, a large number of the State univer- 
sities have no preparatory departments, but confine themselves exclu- 
sively to collegiate instruction. 
On the other hand, of the 154,429 private secondary pupils, over one- 
third are found in higher institutions. In the North Central Division, 
indeed, more than one-half of the private secondary pupils are found in 
institutions classed as collegiate, while in the North Atlantic Division 
only about one-sixth,—a good evidence of the higher degree of develop- 
ment of the colleges of the latter section. 
The 239,556 high-school pupils of Column 2, combined with the 
12,966,321 public elementary pupils of Column 2, Table 1, form the 
common-school enrollment, the statistics of which are given in detail 
in Chapter 11 (“Statistics of State common-school systems”). 
The statistics of public high schools and private secondary schools 
(Columns 2 and 6 of the following table) are also given more particu- 
larly by States and by schools in subsequent chapters.

  WHAT PER CENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION IS UNDER INSTRUCTION. 
Table 3 gives the per cent of the population receiving instruction in 
the different grades in public and in private schools, The same is also 
shown more clearly to the eye in Diagram 1. 
Out of every 100 persons 22-69 are receiving school education; of 
these, 20°46 are in public schools and 2-23 in private schools.  
-P-A-G-E-33
    GENERAL SUMMARY OF PUPILS. 5 
Of the 22-69 pupils, moreover, 21-84, or somewhat more than one-fifth 
of the population, are under elementary instruction; 0-62, or 1 person 
in every 160, is under secondary instruction; and 0-23, or 1 person in 
every 439, is under higher instruction. 
Of the 21-84 elementary pupils, 20, or precisely one-fifth of the 
population, are found in public schools. A smaller proportion of the 
secondary pupils are public, and in the higher grade the Bryate 
‘students are in the majority.

WHAT PART OF THE SCHOOL POPULATION IS ATTENDING SCHOOL. 
In Table 4a comparison is made between the school population (i. e., 
the whole number of children 5 to 18 years of age) and the number of 
pupils actually receiving elementary and secondary instruction. The 
results are also shown graphically, in part, in Diagram 2. 
Tt will be seen that in each grade of instruction, in both public and 
private schools, the North and West have a greater percentage of their 
school population enrolled than the South, except that the North Central 
Division falls behind the South in regard to private secondary pupils. 
In most of the States of the North Central Division, however, the condi- 
tions. have been such that they have not encouraged the establishment 
of private secondary schools, inasmuch as public high schools have 
almost from the beginning been a part of their public-school systems. 
Secondary education especially lacks development in the South. 
Taking the public and private together (Column 7 of the table), it will be 
seen that there are Jess than half as many secondary pupils in propor- 
tion to the school population as there are in the North. The North 
Atlantic Division, for instance, has 2-94 secondary pupils to the 100 
children of school age, against 1-14 in the South Central Division. 
If public secondary education alone is considered (Column 5), the con- 
trast is still stronger. The figures of Column 5 reflect the opposition 
that Still exists in some parts of the South to the establishment of 
public high schools. 
For every 100 children 5 to 18 years of age in the United States there 
are 73°82 pupils receiving elementary instruction, and 2-09 receiving 
secondary instruction; the remaining 24-09 are classed on Diagram 2 as 
“nonattendants,” though as a small portion of the 75-91 (=73-824 
2-09) pupils have passed the age of 18 years, the number of nonattend- 
ants between the ages of 5 and 18 years should be slightly larger than 
24-09 to the 100. The number of nonattendants shown on the diagram 
may therefore be considered as representing the minimum values. 
It is not to be understood, however, that all these nonattendants are 
growing up in ignorance. Some are too young to attend, others 
haye passed through the elementary grades, perhaps have received 
some secondary education, and have left school for other occupations,

  8 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
PROPORTION OF ELEMENTARY, SECONDARY, AND HIGHER PUPILS. 
Table 5 has been computed to show explicitly the relative number 
of pupils in the different grades. 
In the public schools and colleges 97:73 per cent of all pupils are 
found in the elementary grades; 1-87 per cent, or about 1 pupil in 53, in 
the secondary grades; and only 0.40 per cent, or 1 in 250, is receiving 
the higher education. 
In private teaching the proportion of elementary pupils is somewhat 
less, being only 82-76 per cent, or about five-sixths of the whole number ~ 
of private pupils; secondary pupils, 10:66 per cent, or a little more 
than 1 private pupil in 10; higher pupils, 6°58 per cent, or about 1 
in 15. 
How overwhelming the majority of elementary pupils is, may be 
seen at a glance by comparing the relative lengths of the two groups 
of lines in Diagram 2, on the left and on the right.

PROPORTION OF PUBLIC AND OF PRIVATE INSTRUCTION. 
Table 6 and Diagram 3 show the relative proportion of public and 
of private instruction in each grade. 
It. may be repeated here that some of the data upon which this and 
the accompanying tables are based are incomplete, especially as, relates 
to private elementary schools and public high schools. 
Taking the figures as they stand, public schools give 91-54 per cent 
ot allelementary instruction; 61:59 per cent of all secondary instruction; 
and 35°39 per cent of all higher instruction. 
Normal schools are included in the institutions of higher instruction. 
These are for the most part public. Omitting them, the proportion of 
higher instruction given in public institutions, as compared with pri- 
vate, is somewhat less. (Sce Table 9.) 
In the elementary grades the proportion of public instruction as com- 
pared with private is greater in the South than in the North. This 
may be ascribed to the predominance of the colored element in the 
South, who attend mainly the public elementary schools.

  10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Of secondary education about twice as large a share is furnished by 
the public in the North asin the South. The lack of public high schools 
in some portions of the South, already referred to, is the cause of this 
showing. 
Although the North Atlantic Division only gives 34:13 per centof its 
secondary instruction in private schools, as compared with 62-70 per 
. cent in the South Atlantic Division, yet the former division actually 
has more private secondary pupils, compared with its school population, 
than the latter, as will be seen by reference to Table 4.

HiGHER INSTRUCTION SPECIALLY CONSIDERED. 
(Tables 7 to 10.) 
HIGHER STUDENTS AND POPULATION COMPARED. 
In Table 4 data were given to show the extent of the diffusion of 
elementary and secondary instruction, as compared with the school 
population. In Table 7 corresponding data are given for higher 
instruction, but on a different basis, namely, on the basis of number of . 
~ college students to each 100,000 persons of the population. This table 
is further illustrated by Diagram 4. 
The number of college students relative to the population has been 
frequently made a subject of inquiry. ‘The present number is shown 
by Column 2 of Table 7 to be 111°8 per 100,000 of the population; in 
other words, one person in 895 is receiving the higher education, 
taking into account only strictly collegiate and post-graduate students. 
If, to this, the 55-7 medical, law, and theological students are added, 
there results 167-5 collegiate and professional students per 100,000, or 
1 person in 597. By adding the normal students (60-4), we get a total 
of 227-9 students per 100,000, or 1 person in 439 receiving some form of 
higher instruction. ss 
It does not appear that there is any very great difference in the relative 
number of college students proper in the different sections of the 
country. The North Atlantic Division is somewhat in excess, having 
125-3 per 100,000, or 1 person in 798; and the Western Division the 
least, viz, 88°6 per 100,000, or 1 person in 1,129.  
-P-A-G-E-39
  
  GENERAL SUMMARY OF PUPILS. 11 
The maxima and minima of professional students are found in the- 
same two divisions, 71-4 for the North Atlantic and 26-9 for the 
Western. 
Tn normal instruction the South is distinctly in the rear; in each of 
the Southern divisions the number of normal students per 100,000 of 
the population is only slightly over one-half the average of the United 
States. It might be stated, in addition, that many of the normal schools 
in-the South, especially those for the colored race, are of & compara- 
tively low grade, hardly coming up to the standard of higher instruction 
in any rigid interpretation of the term.

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HIGHER INSTRUCTION. 
In order to give some precise idea as to what extent in general the 
state has assumed the office of higher instruction in this country Table 
8 has been computed, showing the number of public and private stu- 
dents, respectively, to each 100,000 persons of the population. Dia- 
gram 5 contains the same data graphically exhibited; and Table9 gives 
the relative proportions, or percentage, of public and private higher 
students. 
Of the 111:8 collegiate students proper in the United States to each 
100,000 persons, 21:7, or 19-4 per cent of the whole, are in public insti- 
tutions and 90-1 are in private institutions. Four-fifths of the higher 
education in this country is therefore conducted under private auspices. 
Public higher education is confined almost exclusively to the State 
universities and the agricultural and mechanical colleges. 
It is in the North Atlantic Division that the state has been the most 
backward in assuming the work of higher education. -The States of 
that division have the highest number of collegiate students in propor- 
tion to population, viz, 125-3 per 100,000; yet of these only 9-8, or 
about 8 per cent, are in institutions that can be said to be under pub- 
lic management. Further westward the percentage of public collegi- 
ate students is largely augmented; in the North Central States it is 
31-5 per cent of the whole; while in the States of the Western Division 
it reaches up to 49-5 per cent, or about one-half of the whole number.

  GENERAL SUMMARY OF PUPILS. 13 
Professional instruction is still more largely under private manage- 
ment. Of the 55-7 medical, law, and theological students per 100,000 
persons, only 7:4, or 13-2 per cent of the whole, are in public institu- 
tions, mostly departments of State universities. The proportion of 
public students of this class also largely increases westward. There 
is no professional instruction given by the state in the North Atlantic 
States, while in the Western Division the proportion slightly exceeds 
one-half (51:6 per cent), though the whole amount in this division is 
small. 
As regards normal instruction, the geographical distribution of the 
percentage of public students is curiously reversed. The North Atlan- 
tic States have taken the lead in the matter of public normal schools. 
These States not only have the highest number of normal students 
(88-4 per 100,000), but educate 97-4 per cent of them, all but a trifling, 
portion, in public schools. Private normal schools in that section that 
merit the name are almost nonexistent. The number of private nor-_ 
mal-school pupils per 100,000 persons increases westward, it being 22:3 
in the Western Division, or 31:2 per cent of the whole number.

  GENERAL SUMMARY OF PUPILS. 15 
DISTRIBUTION OF STUDENTS IN PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
Table 10 gives the number of professional students attending schools 
of medicine, law, and theology, and classifies them as public and 
private. 
Of the 22,263 medical students in the United States 2,525, or about 
1 in 9, are found in public institutions. The number of public law 
students is somewhat less, viz, 2,243, yet the proportion to the total 
number of law students is much greater, being about that of 3 to 8. 
This results from there being so few private law schools. In the North 
Central States there are 1,621 public law students to 525 private, or 
more than 3 to 1, while in the Western Division there are 147 public 
to only 5 private. 
Theological instruction is given entirely in institutions under private 
management, and, with the present multiplicity of denominational 
ereeds and beliefs, this practice, for obvious reasons, is likely to con- 
tinue.* ‘ 
‘The total number of medical, law, and theological students stand 
very nearly in the proportion of 15, 4, and 5, respectively.

GENERAL SUMMARY OF PUPILS. i 
while 59.4 per cent are girls, so that there are about 3 girls to every 2° 
boys. This excess of girls receiving public secondary instruction is 
confined to no particular section of the Union, but characterizes each 
of the geographical divisions. 
On the other hand, 55 per cent of the private secondary pupils are 
boys, and only 45 per cent girls. The excess of boys occurs in all the 
geographical divisions except the South Central, where the boys and 
girls are about evenly balanced. : 
In attempting to assign a reason for this contrast of sex of secondary 
pupils in public and private schools, it will probably be found that the 
public high schools fail to receive a due proportion of boys because so 
many of them are obliged or prefer to go to work after finishing their 
elementary school course; the more ambitious of them enter mercantile 
establishments or the offices of business men, or continue their educa- 
tion in commercial colleges, instead of going to public high schools. 
With the girls, especially those of the more well-to-do families, fhe case 
is different; fewer of them are pressed to engage in active employ- 
ment at an early age, and more are left free to pursue the course of 
liberal culture that the public high school affords, or if they desire to 
prepare themselves to become teachers, the high school is right in the 
line to second their efforts. 
Private secondary pupils, on the other hand, are largely found in 
schools especially designed to prepare for college, or in the prepara- 
tory departments of colleges themselves; and the fact that. collegiate 
education is still principally confined to men would seem to be instru- 
mental in determining the sex of the pupils preparing for it. 
It may be that the present tendency to organize business and manual- 
training courses in high schools, as well as to establish high schools 
specifically designed to make business instruction or manual training 
predominating features, will be instrumental in inducing more boys to 
pursue a course of public secondary instruction.

Il.—SEX OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. 
Table 13 gives the sex of students in universities and colleges (con- 
sidering only collegiate’and post-graduate students), Table 14 gives 
the proportion or percentage of each sex, which is also ee graphi- 
cally in Diagram 7. 
It appears that of the 72,460 college students in the United States 
49,100, or 67-8 per cent, are males, and 23,360, or 32-2 per cent, are 
females. There are, therefore, nearly half as many females receiving 
a collegiate education as there are males. 
‘Taking the public universities and colleges alone the proportion of 
male students is greater, being 81 per cent of the total, or more than 
four-fifths. In fact, the number of female students in public universi.. 
ties and colleges is insignificant in all except the North Central and 
Western States. The North Central States count 2,000 female students 
in public institutions, and the States of the Western Division 459 out 
of a total of 1,468, or 31:3 per cent. 
In private collegiate institutions the proportion of female students is 
considerably greater, being 35:4 per cent. In the two Southern divisions, 
indeed, the women outnumber the men. A great many of the so-called 
female colleges, however, especially in the South and West, are not 
strictly collegiate institutions, but belong rather to the grade of second- 
ary schools.

        NUMBER OF FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENTS AS COMPARED WITH THE 
POPULATION—PROPORTION IN EACH CLASS OF INSTITUTIONS. 
Table 15 (p. 23) divides the whole number of female college studeuts 
into three classes, according to the character of institution attended, 
viz, (1) public coeducational colleges, (2) private coeducational colleges, 
and (3) colleges for women only. 
Table 16 compares the number of female college students with the 
population, giving the number to each 100,000 inhabitants, classified as 
before. The same is also shown graphically in Diagram 8.

  22 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
It appears that in the United States 36 women attend college for 
every 100,000 persons, which is in the ratio of 1 to 2,800 of the popula- 
tion. Of these 36 there are 4:1 attending public coeducational institu- 
tions, 12°6 attending private coeducational institutions, and 19-3 attend- 
ing colleges for women only; 11-5 per cent of the whole number attend 
public coeducational institutions, or 1 in 9; 35 per cent attend private 
coeducational institutions, making a total of 46°5 per cent, or nearly one- 
half, in coeducational institutions; 53-5 per cent attend colleges for 
women only. 
By inspecting the geographical classification the status of female 
college education is seen to present striking contrasts in the different 
sections of the country. 
In the first place, it is developed by far to the greatest extent in the 
South, the two Southern divisions having 48:7 and 50-2 students per- 
100,000 persons, respectively (see Diagram 8), or nearly twice the average 
of the rest of the Union. 
In the next place, this large attendance is found almost exclusively 
in colleges for women only, in the South Atlantic Division 88-7 per 
cent and in the South Central Division 73-2 per cent of the whole 
attending that class of institutions. (Diagram 9.) 
The North Atlantic Division is distinguished by having a less num- 
ber of female college students in proportion to population than any 
other section of the Union, viz, 25-3 per 100,000 persons; and this in 
spite of the fact that all the female colleges of a higher grade (included 
under Division A in the detailed female college tables of this Report), 
with three exceptions only, are found in the North Atlantic Division. 
The female college students in that section, therefore, while fewer in 
number, are pursuing more strictly collegiate courses, according to the 
generally recognized standards; in the South, on the other hand, female 
colleges frequently do not rise above the type of the secondary school. 
There is danger here as elsewhere of being led astray by names. 
The North Atlantic States resemble the South, however, in their slow 
acceptance of the coeducational idea. Of all the female college stu- 
dents in those States 67-7 per cent, or more than two-thirds, are found 
in exclusively female colleges. In this respect the West offers a strong 
contrast to the East and South. In the North Central States only 16.4 
per cent, or less than a sixth of the female students, are met with in 
colleges for women only, while in the Western Division all but 3-4 per 
cent, or more than 29 out of 30, attend coeducational institutions. 
Coeducation is a distinguishing feature of the public as well as the 
private colleges in the North Central and Western States. Of the 33-9 
female college students per 100;000 inhabitants in the North Central 
States 8-7, or more than one-fourth, attend public universities and col- 
leges, while of the 25-5 students per 100,000 in the Western Division 
13:7, or more than one-half, attend public institutions. Public female 
college students in the East and South are almost nonexistent. What

-P-A-G-E-52
    24 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Of the 39,137 professional students in normal schools, 12,412, or 31:7 
per cent, are males, and 26,725, or 68-3 per cent, are females. 
The smallest percentage of males is found in the public normal schools 
of the North Atlantic States and the extreme West. 
In private normal schools the male students are slightly in excess, 
being 50:3 per cent of the whole. Only about one-seventh (14:6 per 
cent) of the whole number of normal students, however, are found in 
private normal schools, as was shown in Table 9. 
The Western Division is strongly emphasized here as elsewhere, 
having the least proportion of males in public normal schools and the 
greatest in private. 
Public normal students are divided as to sex in nearly the same pro- 
portions as the whole body of common-school teachers, as will appear 
from the following:

STATISTICS OF STATE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEMS.) 
Nore.—This chapter relates to public day schools of elementary and secondary grado (primary, 
grammar, and high schools). 
SUMMARY. 
  The following statement is made up from returns for 1891~92 from 
all the States except two, viz, Alabama and Delaware, for which the 
figures of 1889-’90 are used. Some slight correction will therefore be 
required when the returns from those States shall have been received.

GENERAL REMARKS UPON THE TABLES. 
The following tables give the statistics of 189192 for each of the 
States except Delaware and Alabama; in the case of these two States 
the figures of 1889-90 are the latest obtainable. : 
In several instances State superintendents have not included reports 
from all of their counties, so that the totals for the State show an abrupt 
falling off of school attendance, expenditure, ete., which really did not 
exist. Whenever practicable the figures for these- missing counties 
haye been supplied by the Bureau, using the latest reports available or 
some reliable estimate. Though the results obtained thereby are not 
accurate, they are considerably nearer the truth than if the missing 
counties were given 0, which is what is virtually done when they are 
omitted altogether.

apparent anomalies familiar to those who make a study of educational 
statistics. 
The observations upon statistical methods made in connection with 
the tables are commended to the attention of those who have to do

STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 31 
POPULATION. 
(Tables 1 and 2.) 
Table 1 gives (1) the total population of each State, (2) the school 
population, or number of possible pupils, and (3) the adult male popu- 
lation, or number of taxpayers or school supporters. These are all 
estimated for 1892 upon the basis of the U. S. Census of 1890. 
The slow diminution in the relative number of children in the popu- 
lation since 1870, and the differences which characterize the different 
States as regards their relative number of children, are shown in Col- 
umns 2 to 4 of Table 2. This is an important matter in considering 
actual school attendance and one which has already been emphasized 
in previous reports of this office. 
Column 5 of the same table exhibits the relation which the number 
of adult males bears to that of children. When it is considered that in 
Montana, for instance, there are five times as many male adults to the 
hundred children as in South Carolina, which is one of the surprising 
facts developed by the U.S. Census of 1890, an idea may be had of the 
adverse conditions the latter State, as well as the entire South in a 
greater or less degree, has to contend with in this regard alone in sus- 
taining a public-school system. In Diagram 1 the inequalities in the 
ratios of adult to school population are rendered more striking to the eye. 
The proportion of white children of foreign birth or parentage is 
given in Column 6 of Table 2, while Columns 7 to 9 give the percentage 
of foreign-born population since 1870. The foreign born number 14.77 
per cent, or about one-seventh, of the total population, which is a 
Slight increase over the percentage of 1870. The foreign element is 
almost wanting in the South, while in the North and West persons of 
foreign birth form about one-fifth of the population. :

ENROLLMENT. 
Tables 3 and 4 give various facts relating to the common school 
enrollment, past and present. 
It appears that the total number of pupils enrolled on the school 
registers during the school year 1891-92, so far as can now be deter- 
mined, was 13,205,877, or an average of 68:82 pupils for each 100 
children of school age (5 to 18 years), as against 69-03 in 1890-91. 
A consolidation of the gains and lesses of one year shows a net 
increase of 203,238 pupils over the last preceding reports (in the case 
of most of the States over those of 1890-91). This indicates a gain of 
1-56 per cent, which is less than for several years past; the gain of 
1890-91 over 1889-90, indeed, was 2:57 per cent. 
These figures seem to show that the increase in enrollment has not 
kept pace during the past year with the growth of the school popula- 
tion. Some of the State reports of enrollment are imperfect, however, 
and this loss of pupils as compared with the total number of children 
may be only apparent. Kentucky, for instance, shows (‘Table 4, Col- 
umn 5) a loss of 36,627 pupils since 1890-91; but Supt. Thompson, of 
that State, attributes this seeming loss to imperfect reports, and informs 
the Bureau that it is doubtful if there has been any real loss. The 
decrease of 10,018 pupils in Indiana may probably be explained in the 
same way. 
The increase in some of the States of the Western Division is phe- 
. nomenal; Montana, Idaho, and Washington each increased their school 
enrollment by about one-seventh, and Utah by nearly one-fifth (18-50 
per cent). 
Sex.—The attempt has been made in the present Report to classify the 
common school enrollment by sex. The result shows that in each sec- 
tiofi of the Union, as a rule, more boys are enrolled in the common 
schools than girls. This might have been expected from the fact that 
there is an excess of boys in the school population, 50:47 per cent of 
all the children from 5 to 18 years of age being boys (Table 1, Columns 
3,4, and 6). But itis further shown (Table 4, Columns 7 and 8) that 
in proportion to the total numbers of each sex more boys than girls 
are enrolled. Out of every 100 boys of school age in 31 States 68-42 
are enrolled; girls, 67-48. The difference is slight, and may be due to 
the reluctance of parents to intrust their girls to the public schools at 
so early an age as their boys. : 
Classification of pupils by age.—A knowledge of the ages of common- 
school pupils is a great desideratum. Only three States, viz, Vermont, 
New Jersey, and North Carolina, furnish complete information upon 
this point. Several other States report the number of pupils above 
and below certain age limits. Using this information as a basis, an 
estimate has been made of the number of pupils of each year of age 
from 5 to 18, which is probably not grossly in error, and may serve for 
most purposes in lieu of more accurate figures. A corresponding esti-

mate was made of the whole number of children of each year of age. 
The results appear in the following table (Table 5), and are plotted in

According to the above table, of the 13,205,877 common-school pupils 
in the United States, 10,608,800, or 80-33 per cent, are under 14 years 
ofage. Indeed, it will appear from the diagram that the pupils begin 
to thin out very rapidly after reaching the thirteenth year. The 
maximum attendance is from 9 to 11 years of age. 
It is worthy of note that, according to this table, 90-6 per cent of the 
children from 10 to 11 years of age are enrolled in the common schools. 
As all persons who reach maturity pass through this age period, it is 
evident that, if this percentage remained constant from year to year, 
more than nine-tenths of the adult population of the United States (dis- 
regarding immigrants) would have received some degree of education in 
the common schools, the more so, in that many between 10 and 11 not in 
schoolnow have attended school at an earlier age or will attend hereafter. 
Add to this number those who h ave received their education in private 
schools only, and making due allowance for duplicate registrations, 
there would remain only an inconsidera ble fraction of persons raised in 
this country who had never attended school at all. 
This well-nigh universal education is almost wholly voluntary. Prob- 
ably not one child in a hundred is sent to school under compulsion of 
- the law. 
Percentage of school population enrolled.The number of pupils en- 
rolled in each State at four differen t dates or epochs is given ia Columns 
2 to 5of Table 3; and in Columns 6 to 9 is given for the same dates the 
percentage of ECnoel population enrolled. The number of pupils enrolled 
for every 100 children of school age has increased from 68-61 in 1889~90 
to 68-82 in 1891-92.

more than 80 per cent of all persons from 5 to 18 years of age. It is 
probable that a rigorous exclusion of duplicate enrollments, such as 
is practiced in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, would somewhat alter 
thisshowing. In addition to what has been already said upon this sub- 
ject in previous reports of this office, reference may be made to certain 
wholesale duplications to which State Superintendent Knoepfler, of 
Iowa, calls attention. In his report for 1892-93 (p. 133) he says: 
Experience shows that many young teachers do not understand how properly to 
keep a daily register and make aterm report therefrom. * * * Frequently the 
enrollment for three separate terms is added to get the enrollment for the year, 
when in fact the majority of the names have thus been counted three times, thus 
giving a greatly exaggerated enrollment. 
Towa, it will be observed, stands next to the highest in Diagram 3.

lowing table for each year since 1870~71, and illustrated further by

The strong upward trend of the lines of the two Southern divisions 
in the diagram records a growth in public school attendance during the 
past two decades of epoch-making proportions. The close coincidence 
of these two lines throughout their length indicates a similarity of con- 
ditions obtaining simultaneously over a wide extent of territory.

  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 41 
There are grounds for apprehending that these two Southern lines 
will not rise much higher than at present. The small proportion of 
adults in the South compared with the number of children to be edu- 
cated {see Diagram 1), and the fact that of this, small proportion fully 
one-third are negroes who contribute a minimum to the support of the 
schools, are circumstances adverse to the highest development of a 
public-school system. Those who are familiar with the educational 
history of the North are aware of the widespread repugnance that has 
been exhibited of one class of people to support schools for the benefit 
of another; of the rich for the benefit of the poor; of those having no 
children for the benefit of those having them; of the people of one 
locality to be taxed for the benefit of those of another. Instances have 
occurred of lawsuits being instituted over the petty question of whether 
a child should be educated in this or that district school. It is inevitable 
that these antagonisms should be intensified in the South, with its 
sharply defined race contrasts; one race with little property being de- 
pendent for education largely upon the financial resources of another. 
That the lines of the Southern divisions have approached so near 
the Northern, as is the case in the diagram, is a testimonial to the 
existence in that section of a widespread determination to secure the — 
benefits of education to all the people, and shows that it has in a large 
measure been effective in bringing the children into the schools. The 
chief drawback is the short school term, (See Diagram 6.) 
The line of the Western States also bears strongly upward. The 
twenty years covered by the diagram have witnessed the change of 
many of these States from frontier communities to more settled con- 
ditions. Here the great preponderance of adults and sparsity of 
children render the financial burden of providing education for all 
youth peculiarly light. 
The North Central States have about held their own in the last two 
decades as regards proportion of school population enrolled. In the 
North Atlantic States there has been a marked loss. When it is con- 
sidered, however, to what extent enrollment statistics were formerly 
inflated through duplicate registrations, there is reason for supposing 
that the loss in the North Atiantic States is more apparent than real. 
A complete eradication of duplicate enrollments would probably bring 
both the northern divisions down still lower in the scale. The low 
position of Rhode Island in Diagram 3 must be attributed, at least in 
part, to rigidly correct reports of enrollment, each pupil being reported 
only once, no matter in how many schools enrolled.

_STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 43 
AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. 
The average number of pupils in attendance upon the schools of the 
United States each day, according to the most recent reports (mainly 
1891-92), was 8,547,551. 
By comparing the reports of each State for the next preceding year, 
the aggregate increase is found to be 142,539, or a gain of 1:70 per cent, 
against a gain in enrollment of only 1:56 per cent. This indicates, if 
the reports are correct, a more regular attendance of enrolled pupils, 
The average attendance forms 64:73 per cent of the enrollment; that 
is, 64:73 pupils attended scheol each day for every 100 enrolled; or, 
yiewing the matter in another light, each enrolled pupil attended school 
on an average, 64:73. days out of every 100 the schools were in session. 
This percentage indicating regularity of attendance, being the rela- 
tion of the average attendance to the enrollment, is affected by any 
error in either of these quantities. If the enrollment, which is the 
divisor, is too large, through containing duplicates or other cause, the 
resulting percentage will be too small. On this ground it is probable 
that the percentage, 64:73, is less than it should be. Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island, which are known to exclude duplicates, show a high 
regularity of attendance, the former State over 74 percent. 
A high regularity of attendance may, however, and probably does 
in some cases erroneously appear, through inflating the average attend- 
ance, i. e., increasing the dividend. This may occur in the case of com- 
puting the average attendance of any single school, for instance, 
through adding together the three reports of the average attendance 
of the school for three consecutive terms, instead of taking the average 
of them. 
The phenomenally low regularity of attendance in Minnesota (47:11) 
probably results from some method of ascertaining average attendance 
in that State not in uniformity with the general practice in that regard.

The increase in the North Atlantic Division from 59-3 to 66-4 is prob- 
ably due in part to more correct records of enrollment in recent years. 
Where the same pupil is registered twice during the school year, he

  appears in the statistics as two pupils, each attending only a portion 
of the year, and the “regularity of attendance” appears too small, as 
already noted. 
What increase in the regularity of attendance there actually is may be 
ascribed in some measure to the greater proportion of urban schools 
existing at present. In cities attendance is more regular than in the 
country. The District of Columbia, which is a pure urban system, 
stands first in point of regularity, viz, 75 per cent. 
The South Central Division has decreased in the 21 years from 69-8 
to 63-3, Here the course of events apparently has been reversed. At 
the earlier date common schools had not spread beyond the cities to 
any great extent in some of the States of that division, so that their 
school systems were of a general urban character. Then there were 
largely exaggerated reports of average attendance in Mississippi for a 
number of ‘years, which made the regularity of attendance in that sec- 
tion appear greater than was actually the case. Teachers were paid 
in that State according to the number of pupils in average attendance, 
and the accuracy of their statistics was allowed to suffer in behalf of 
their pecuniary interests, as appears from the State school reports. 
School population and school attendance.—Diagram 5 shows the rela- 
tion between the number of children of school age and the number of _ 
pupils in daily attendance on the schools, for each State. States in this

greater or less regularity of attendance of the pupils enrolled.

  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. AT 
LENGTH OF SCHOOL TERM, ETC. | 
The average school term of the United States in 189192 was 137-1 
days, as against 130°3 in 1879-80, and 134-7 in 1889-90. There has 
thus been an increase of 6-8 days in 12 years. 
The length in days of the school term of each State in 1891-92 is 
given in Column 5 of Table 8, and the same is also shown graphically 
in Diagram 6, where the several States are arranged according to their 
length of school term. 
It will be noticed that New Jersey has the longest school term, viz, 
190 days, while North Carolina has the shortest, 62:4 days, or some- 
what less than a third of that of New Jersey. 
Whole amount of instruction given.—The total number of days 
attended by all pupils, or, what is the same thing, the total number 
of days schooling given, in 189192 was 1,172,261,842, which allows an * 
average of 61-1 days for every child 5 to 18 years of age. (Columns 7 and 
8 of Table 8.) . 
This average number of days schooling given for every child 5 to 18 
years of age is in fact the result of a comparison of the amount of 
instruction given with the number of children of school age, and is the 
best single quantity for determining the extent and prevalence of 
school education in one community as compared with another. A State 
may have a good attendance at school, but only for a brief period; or, 
on the other hand, it may have a long school term but comparatively 
few pupils in attendance. The quantity under consideration takes into 
account both the attendance of pupils and the length of school term, 
and compares the total amount of instruction given with total number 
of children who are subjects for instruction. 
In Column 8 of Table 8, and in Diagram 7 (p. 50), is shown, this 
average number of days schooling given for every cbild of school age for 
each State. The order of States in Diagram 7 differs from that of either 
Diagram 5 or 6; in fact the former diagram is in a sense compounded 
of the two latter. Massachusetts stands at the head of Diagram 7, 
and so gives the most school instruction as compared with its school 
population, though it does not rank the highest in either number of 
pupils or length of school term taken singly. Where a State has both 
a low attendance (Table 7, Column 9) and a short school term it makes 
a very poor showing on Diagram 7, so that the contrasts exhibited in it 
are stronger than in either5 or 6. Massachusetts, for instance, is seen 
to give more than four times as much school instruction as North Caro- 
lina, considering their relative numbers of children of school age, the 
numbers being 91-8 and 21-3 days, respectively, per child of school age. 
The summaries by divisions at the foot of Diagram 7 bring into sharp 
relief the small amount of school instruction in the South as a whole 
when considered in reference to the number of children of school age— 
about one-half of what is given in the North and West. This is an 
unquestionable conclusion, despite inaccuracies here and there in the 
statistics.

But there is another face to the matter. The South teems with 
children, but has comparatively few adults; conversely the North, and 
especially the far West, have few children and a large ratio of adults. 
(See Diagram 1, p. 32.) It is the male adults in general who provide 
and pay for the schools. It will be in order to inquire, then, What is 
. the relation between the total amount of instruction given and the 
number of male adults? or, How many days’ schooling does each male 
adult provide and pay for? The answer to this question is given in 
the following table: 
Average number of days’ schooling provided for by each male adult.

Here the South is well up to the North and considerably in advance 
of the West. 3 
The factsin the case, then, may be summed up as follows: The average 
male adult in the South provides nearly as many days’ schooling as in 
the North and more than in the West. But, on account of the excess 
of children in the South to be provided for and the few adults, the 
total amount of schooling provided is only sufficient to furnish each 
child in the South with about half as many days on the average as falls 
to the Northern or Western child. 
Observations on ascertaining the average length of school term.—The aggregate num- 
ber of days’ attendance given in Table 8, when not reported direct by State super- 
intendents, has been obtained by multiplying the average daily attendance of pupils. 
by the average length of school term in days. Either of these three quantities is 
thus made a simple function of the other two, and can be readily obtained when the 
other two are given. This relation between these three quantities does not rigidly 
subsist in the statistical systems of some of the States, owing to the diverse methods 
of computing average attendance and average length of school term. It is believed, 
however, that it would conduce to the accuracy and uniformity of school statistics 
if such were the case. 4 
A practical application is made of this principle in finding the average length of 
school term of a number of States, as recorded in the summaries of Column 5, where 
the aggregate attendance in days in each division and in the United States is divided 
by the corresponding average daily attendance to get the average length of school 
term in days of each group of States. 
By this method the school term of each State in taking the average is in fact 
given a weight proportioned to the school attendance of the State, as should be done 
under a correct interpretation of the expression “average length of school term.” 
The result might more properly be called ‘average length of attendance,” which is 
essentially what it is desired to know. -

STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. ok 
  A method in use in somo States for finding the average school term, of a county, 
for instance, is to weight the different school terms of the towns or districts the 
- county is composed of by the number of schools in each; in other words, the total 
number of days (or months) all the schools of a county were kept is divided by the 
total number of schools to get the average time each one was kept. So, in finding 
the average term for the State, the school is taken as the unit instead of the pupil, 
as in the Bureau’s method. When the schools differ much in size (number of pupils), 
as they do in all mixed urban and rural systems, varying from some half dozen to 
500 or more pupils each, the average term obtained by this method varies con- 
siderably from that obtained by the foregoing. The long terms of the large city 
schools not being given their proper weight, the resulting average is too small, 
The same objection applies still more forcibly to weighting the school terms of the 
different counties or towns by the number of school districts in each. 
Still another method is to add together the school terms of the different counties 
or towns and divide by the number of such counties or towns; i. e., the simple 
arithmetical mean is taken. Smithville, for instance, with its 100 pupils, counts for 
as much in forming the average as the metropolis, with its 100,000. Smithville, 60 
days; metropolis, 180 days; average term of the two, 120 days. This method, if it 
can be so called, gives altogether too short an average term, and nothing can be 
said in defense of it. It is as if, wishing to get the population per square mile of 
Minnesota and Dakota combined, we said, Minnesota, 9°86; Dakota, 0:92; average 
number of persons per square mile.in the combined territory (0-92+-9-86)—2 =5:39, 
instead of dividing the total population of the two States together by the combined 
area in square miles. 
The ‘‘aggregate number of days attendance” is a statistical item of the utmost 
simplicity and of great value, about the meaning of which there can be little or no 
difference of opinion. Every teacher’s register that records the number of pupils 
present each day in any schools, as they all presumably do, contains the data for 
ascertaining it for that school for the school year by the simple process of addition 
or summing up. E 
Progress.—Table 9 gives the length of school term in days for each 
section of the country since 187071; also the average number of days 
schooling given for each child of school age. The same is also graph- 
ically exhibited in Diagram 8. 
The amount of instruction given as compared with the school popu- 
lation, shown in the lower part of the diagram, exhibits a decided 
increase in every section of the Union. This increasé has been effected 
in the North Atlantic Division mainly through lengthening the school 
term} in the two Southern Divisions, until about 1880, however, there © 
was a decrease in the average school term, the multiplication of short- 
term schools outside the cities bringing down the general average term 
length. Still, owing to the continued accessions of pupils, the total 
amount of instruction per child of school age has been almost uninter- 
ruptedly increasing in the South, and is now about double what it was 
in 1870-771.

NUMBER AND SEX OF TEACHERS. 
The whole number of teachers employed during the school year 
189192, as shown by Table 10, was 374,460. 
Of these 121,638, or 32-5 per cent, were males; 252,822, or 67-5 per 
cent, were females. 
About one-third of all the teachers in the United States are there- 
fore males. . 
In two States, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, less than one- 
tenth of the teachers are males (Column 8). In each of the other North 
Atlantic States except Pennsylvania more than five-sixths of the teacb- 
ers are women. i 
Arkansas has the highest proportion of male teachers, viz, 70-7 per 
cent. 
In Diagram 9 the total number of teachers, and the number of each 
sex, are plotted for each year since 1870—71. 
Jt will be noted that there has been no perceptible increase in the 
number of male teachers since about the year 1880. The total number 
of teachers has continued to increase uninterruptedly, but the gain 
comes entirely from accessions to the ranks of the female teachers. 
The year 1880 marks an epoch where the lines of the male and the 
female teachers, which had been ascending at a uniform grade, begin 
to diverge widely. 
The following table shows the per cent of male teachers in each 
geographical division each year since 1870/71. In Diagram 10 the same 
is graphically reproduced.

  58 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The trend of the lines in the diagram shows that in every section of 
the country the proportion of inale teachers, which for ten years had been 
_ either constant or actually increasing, commenced to diminish rapidly 
about 1880. To what cause should be ascribed so decided and wide- 
spread a change at that particular period is not immediately apparent. 
It may be that along course of discussion on the avenues open for the 
support of women and the active steps taken in the direction of their 
higher education had gradually familiarized the public mind with their 
needs, capabilities, and aptitudes, and paved the way for more advanced 
ideas; so that when once inaugurated in favorable centers here and 
there, the movement toward the more extended employment of women 
spread rapidly far and wide, the time being ripe for it and only a suffi- 
cient impetus being necessary. - 
CHANGES IN THE TEACHING FORCE DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR. 
Eight States, in addition to reporting the whole number of different 
teachers employed, report the number of teachers’ places or positions; 
or, what is equivalent, the number of teachers, necessary to supply the 
schools (Table 10, Column 9). 
If there is no change in the teaching force of a system during the 
school year, if each teacher occupies, to the end of the year, the place 
he held at the beginning, then the two numbers just referred to will be 
identical. Butin the eight States which report the number of positions, 
there were in ali 88,464 positions in 1891-92, and 110,014 different 
teachers; in other words, there were 124-4.teachers to every 100 posi- 
tions, so that an average of 24-4 positions out of every 100 show a 
change of teachers during the year in the eight States. This average 
should, probably, be larger, as there are, doubtless, cases where a 
teacher is transferred from one school to another and not counted as a 
different teacher, though a change has been effected. 
The number of teachers to 100 positions varies from 106-6 in Kansas 
to 141:7 in Michigan (Column 10). 
It is probable that the number of teachers, as reported in several, perhaps many, 
of the States outside of the eight referred to, is made up in whole or in part (espe- 
cially in the reports of cities), of the number of teachers necessary, instead of the 
whole number of different teachers, and in so far the statistics of teachers are not 
uniform. The headings of the tables or columns in school reports are often not suffi- 
ciently explicit to determine whieh one of the two quantities it is designed to 
give, the number of places or the whole number of different teachers. 
The significant quantity of the two is the number of teachers necessary or required 
by the schools. This, froma statistical point of view, is what should be understood 
by the ‘‘number of teachers.” The whole number of different teachers, including 
in the count all who taught for any period of time, however brief, affords some 
collateral information, that is of value principally when considering the changes 
in the teaching force during the school year.

The ratio of failures to the whole number examined would seem to 
indicate to some extent the degree of severity of the examination and 
the standard of proficiency required in order to successfully pass it. 
In Ohio, where, it may be noted, there were more than half as many 
again examined as there were teachers employed during the year, 48 
per cent, or nearly one-half, failed to pass the examination; from which 
may be argued an excess of candidates for teachers’ positions, and a 
rigid examination. In New Jersey 37-1 per cent, or about 3 out of 
every 8, failed, and in Michigan 35-3 per cent, more than one-third. 
On the other hand, in Tennessee only 6 per cent of those examined 
were refused certificates, and in Nebraska 11 per cent. 
The average of 15 States, of which only 3 are Southern, is 26-4 per 
cent of failures. Evidently in these States considerable discrimination 
is exercised in the selection of teachers. 
A comparison of the whole number of certificates issued with the 
number of different persons who received certificates, in Tennessee, 
Ohio, and Towa, shows numbers of persons who received more than one 
certificate; this is espécially noticeable in Iowa.

d Of the applicants for certificates (29,754).   
  In Table 13 certain facts relating to the education, previous experi- 
ence, and continuity of service of teachers have been collected. Much 
of the information given on these subjects in the different State reports 
lacks uniformity and can not be collected in any one table. 
So far as the information extends, however, the percentage of normal 
graduates (Column 4) ranges from 32 per cent in Rhode Island and 
29-8 in Massachusetts to 5 per cent in Wisconsin. In Iowa, as in New 
Jersey, only the graduates of the State normal school are given. 
Three States show a percentage of college graduates (Column 6) of 
5-6, 5-9, and 4:6, respectively, while Pennsylvania has only 1-1 per 
cent. Probably there is some diversity of standards lurking here. 
Rhode Island reports the number who have received a “college educa- 
cation,” which in the absence of any explanation may be inferred to 
mean the number who have graduated; otherwise the term is an indefi- 
nite one and might embrace those who have attended college only a 
brief period. 
Haperience.—The number of beginners, or wholly inexperienced teach- 
ers, is an important item to know. This is given for 11 States in col- 
umn 7. It ranges from 9-9 per cent in Rhode Island to 26:3 per cent 
in Kansas. This percentage may be taken as some indication of the 
efficiency and standing of the schools. Inexperience generally implies 
poor teaching, whatever may be the native undeveloped talent of the 
teacher.

  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 61 
The 660 given as “beginners” in New Jersey (Column 7) are those 
who had been “teaching one year or less” at the close of the year. 
The New Jersey records of the experience and terms of service are 
almost the only consolidated statistics that exist upon this subject, and 
are, therefore, of peculiar value. Some of the results are as follows: 
Total experience of New Jersey teachers, including the current year (189192).

Between 20 and 25 years. 217 Over 25 years . 181 
Total clas: 4, 644 Average time of serv: Tyrs.8 mos. 
  
It will be seen that 30-7 per cent of all the teachers in the State 
reported have taught 10 years or over. In the cities 38-1 per cent have 
taught 10 years or over. 
In the country schools, taken separately, the average time of service 
was 5 years, 9 months. 
The longest time of service of any one teacher varied in the different 
counties from 13 to 54 years, the latter being the longest time of service 
of any teacher in the State. 
Term of service of Prussian teachers.—The term of service of teachers 
in the people’s schools of Prussia exceeds considerably that of teachers 
in the United States, as will appear from the following table, compiled 
from data givenin Die Volksschulen im preussischen Staate im Jahre 1891: 
Total experience of teachers in the Volksschulen of Prussia.

‘Ineludes only fully employed (voilbeschéftigte) teachers. 
It may be seen from the table that 55-4 per cent of the whole number 
of teachers in the Prussian Volksschulen have served ten years and 
upward. This is nearly twice the percentage of New Jersey. 
The per cent who have served twenty-five years and upwards (20-4 
per cent) is more than five times that of New Jersey. 
The beginners, or those who have taught one year or less, form only 
4-7 per cent of the whole. :

CHAPTER JIT. 
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 
I, BRinF VIEW OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONS 
In 1892. 
France, Republic.—Area, 204,092 square miles. Population (actual) April 12, 1891, 
38,095,156; domiciled, or legal, 38,343,192. 3 
Civil divisions.—For purposes of civil government France is divided into eighty- 
sixdepartments (90 if Algiers be included), each having its local legislative assembly, 
which is formed by election. The departments are subdivided into arrondissements, 
and these into cantons. The smallest civil divisions comprised within the cantons 
are communes, 
  No complete report of education in France has been published since 
1888, but official statistics of recent date give the following particulars: 
Number of students inscribed in 1892 in the state faculties (corres- 
ponding to university students in other countries), 22,516; in the private 
falculties (facultés libres), 988; in the public secondary school for boys 
(lycées, and colléges communaux), 85,291; in private secondary schools 
for boys, 89,566; in public secondary schools for girls (lycées, colléges, 
and cours secondaires), in 1891, 11,645. The enrollment in primary 
schools; public and private (the latter chiefly clerical), in 1891-92 was 
5,556,470 pupils (2,805,849 boys, 2,750,621 girls). The total is 37,413 
less than that for the previous year. Public schools comprised 77.2 
per cent of the total, as against 78.3 per cent in 1890-91. Furthermore 
it appears that 72 per cent of the pupils were in schools under lay as 
against 28 per cent under clerical teachers.” The teaching force of the 
public primaries in 1892 comprised 142,660 persons. The enrollment in 
infant schools (Ecoles Maternelles ages 2 to 6 years) in 1891 was 709,579 
(public 465,333; private 244,246). : 
To summarize, disregarding dates, the total of university students 
was 23,504, or one for every 1,621 inhabitants, of secondary students 
(boys), 174,856, or one for every 218 inhabitants. The enrollment in 
primary schools exclusive of infant schools, 4. ¢., 5,556,470, was equal to 
14.58 per cent of the actual population as against 14.57 per cent in 
1888. The state appropriation for education in 1893 amounted to 
$32,899,943, about 73 per cent being for primary education. The appro- 
priation from state, departments and communes for public primary 
schools in 1892 was $32,424,000, an increase of 60 per cent over 1872.

chairman of the ‘‘Commission de statistique de l’enseignement primaire.”

  74 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The administration and control of public education and the super- 
vision of private schools are functions of the central government con- 
fided to a department, whose chief, the minister of public instruction, 
fine arts, and worship, is a cabinet officer.' 
Scholastic institutions are grouped in three classes—superior, second- 
ary, primary—to each of which corresponds a subdivision of the depart- 
ment of education named, respectively, the department of superior 
instruction, the department of secondary instruction, the department 
of primary instruction. At the head of each of these divisions is a 
director, who is appointed by reason of special qualification for the 
duties of the position and is not, as a rule, disturbed by political 
changes.’ The work of administration and supervision employs a large 
body of officials, who are appointed by the minister, or by the Presi- 
dent of the Republic upon the recommendation of the minister. They 
belong either to the central administration or to the local divisions 
(académies), seventeen in number, including one in Algiers. Each 
académie forms a scholastic unit, whose chief (rectewr) is the official 
head of all the teaching institutions located within its bounds. The 
possession of a doctor’s degree is an essential qualification for the 
rectorship. 
The ninety departments (districts of civil administration) are treated 
as subdivisions of the académies in respect to educational affairs, the 
prefects of departments having a measure of control over primary and 
normal schools. i 
The supervision of secondary instruction is intrusted to general inspec- 
tors, at present ten in number, and that of primary instruction toa graded 
series of inspectors, (1) general inspectors, including nine assigned to par- 
ticular sections of the country, several assigned to the oversight of 
special branches of study, and general inspectresses of infant schools. 
These officials report directly to the minister as to the manner in which 
the educational law is carried out. (2) Academic inspectors (inspecteurs 
Wacadémies), one for each department, who are subordinate to the rec- 
tors. They have the general direction of primary schools, conduct exam- 
inations for teachers’ certificates, appoint all teachers on probation, and 
name the candidates from whom the prefects of departments may 
appoint full teachers. (3) Primary inspectors, at present about 450 in 
number, or one for every 150 primary schools. They inspect the work 
of individual schools, and report to the academic inspector. (4) Med- 
ical inspectors, whose duties include the examination of children with 
respect to their physical condition and of sites and buildings with 
respect to sanitary particulars. There are also inspectresses of board- 
  
1M. Léon Bourgeois, who assumed the office March 17, 1890, was succeeded, Jan- 
uary 11, 1893, by M. Charles Dupuy. He held the office till April 4, 1893, at which 
date M. Poincaré was appointed. 
- ?*The present incumbents are M. Louis Liard, director of superior instruction; M. 
Rabier, of secondary; M. F. Buisson, of primary.

  ing schools for girls. It should be observed that all these officials must 
have access also to private schools. - 
The several classes of officials named constitute the executive branch 
of the ministry. The link between this and the scholastic work is fur- 
nished by the councils. These are composed of members elected by 
their peers from the body of professors, instructors, and teachers, and 
of a certain proportion of appointed members. The superior council, 
whose seat is at Paris, deliberates upon all projects of school law, 
curricula, creation of chairs, nominations to professorships, estimates of 
expenditure, text-books, applications for the privilege of conducting 
private schools, and in general upon matters submitted by the minis- 
ter, whose action is determined largely by the judgment of the council. 
This body has also a final jurisdiction in cases of contention and dis- 
cipline appealed from inferior councils. The members of the superior 
council are generally men of distinction as professors, teachers, authors, 
or administrators. The academic rectors have the advice of academic 
councils composed of inspecteurs @académies, professors, and teachers; 
finally, the prefects are assisted by departmental councils. These sey- 
eral councils save the work of public education to some degree at least, 
from the mechanical routine which is one danger of a highly central- 
ized system. 
The control of the public scholastic work is completed by the organi- 
zation of the teaching service and the imposition of official programmes, 
All professors and teachers of public institutions are employés of the 
state; their qualifications, tenure, and discipline are fixed by law, or 
by ministerial decree; their salaries are paid by the state; all pro- 
fessors must be university graduates. University professors (profes- 
seurs des facultés), who must have the doctor’s degree, are appointed 
by the President of the Republic; assistant professors of faculties and 
professors of secondary schools, by the minister of public instruction. 
The appointment of primary teachers, as before stated, lies with the 
academic inspectors and the prefect. So far, the system would seem to 
be entirely removed from the sympathies and the active participation 
of the people. 
As regards primary schools, however, the people are enlisted in sev- 
eral ways. The law (1833) makes it obligatory upon every commune to 
establish a public school, which under the law of June 16, 1881, must 
be a free school and, under laws of 1882 and 1886, secular and taught 
by a lay teacher. A commune, it must be remembered, is the sim- 
plest civil division in France. Its local affairs are controlled by a 
council, and a mayor chosen from the members of the same. A com- 
mune may have less than 20 inhabitants; it may be a populous city. 
Paris, indeed, is a commune, although differing somewhat from others 
in its form of local government. Large or small, the commune must 
establish a free primary school, provide the site and building and a 
proportion of the current expenditure; not only so, but every com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  
  76 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
mune of more than 500 inhabitants must have a separate school for 
girls (laws of March 15, 1850, and April 10, 1867). 
But although the law is imperative, the Republic is wary, and since 
many communes are too small and too poor to obey the law, and others 
require stimulating, the state has been exceedingly liberal with subsi- 
dies to help in the initial steps. The subsidies and advances for this 
purpose only amounted in the decade 1878-1888 to $105,000,000. . 
In order that the communes should perform their part, provision must 
be made for concerted action. Hence, the departmental councils ap- 
point delegates to confer with the communal authorities and with the 
primary inspectors as to sites, buildings, material, ete. The mayors of 
communes have free access to the schools at all times; their duties and 
those of the delegates are much like those of our district school com- 
mittees, excepting that they have no control over teachers or pro- 
grammes. It is incumbent also upon communes to maintain funds 
(caisses des écoles) for the assistance of indigent pupils. Although the 
law (March 28, 1882) obliges parents to secure the instruction of their 
children, they can make choice of the means,i. e., public schools, private 
schools, home tuition. 
As the state intends that public schools shall be nurseries of patriot- 
ism, there is a powerful motive for making them attractive. 
II. State Facutties. 
A. PROPOSED TRANSFORMATION: Movement toward decentralization, resulting in project 
of law for transforming the faculties into universities—Superior institutions, i. e., 
special schools, not affected by the proposed law—Origin, classification, and purposes 
of the faculties by imperial decree, 1802—Number and location of the original facul- 
ties—Subordination of the faculties to the wniversity chief—The wniversity, its 
antecedents and spirit—Reference to reactionary movements, 1815-1870—The Repub- 
lie pledged to reform the faculties by law of 1875—Condition of the faculties in 1875, 
as set forth in the debate upon the law—Delay in carrying out the order, and practi- 
cal reforms preceding legislation—Chief provisions of the proposed law—Adherence 
to a French type; characteristics of the same—Measures for securing. 
B. DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHING KUNCTIONS: Destructive work of the revolution—Special 
schools for medical instruction and for advanced instruction in arts and sciences; adapta- 
tion to practical demands—Absence of teaching facilities in the faculties; Paris the 
only exception—Spirit of freedom, active after the fall of Napoleon, develops a new 
ideal of a university professor—New agencies introduced for the work of teaching— 
Multiplication of special teaching professors, provision of buildings and material 
appliances, and increase of funds under the Republic—Effect of these measures in 
attracting students—Spirit of solidarity fostered by students’ associations—Citation 
from M, Lavisse.     
  A.—PROPOSED TRANSFORMATION. 
In the province of elementary education the communes, through their 
control of the school tax, have a check upon the central authority. In 
the two higher departments of education there is a steady movement 
toward decentralization. ! 
i | This movement as it affects secondary schools,.i. ¢. lycées and communal colleges, 
was considered in the Commissioner’s Report for 1889-’90, pp. 104-124.

  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 7 
In the department of superior instruction the reaction against abso- 
lute control has culminated in a project of law for the transformation 
of the faculties into independent universities. This project, submitted 
in 1890 by M. Bourgeois, then minister of public instruction, is still 
before the Chambers. To comprehend its scope and bearings it is 
necessary to have in mind the form in which higher education is now 
maintained in France and the conditions from which this form has arisen. 
The institutions for higher education are faculties and special schools,! 
the latter, with few exceptions, created by the Revolutionary leaders 
or formed after their models. The proposed law relates to the faculties 
only. These are groups of professors appointed by the President of the 
Republic in advice with the minister of public instruction, to maintain 
advanced instruction and to examine for and confer degrees, 
1The special schools which are under the exclusive control of the minister of public 
instruction and fine arts are the College de France, Muséum @ Histoire Naturelle, Ecole 
Normale Supérieure, Ecole Frangaise de Rome, Ecole Francaise @ Athénes, Ecole Nationale 
des Chartes, Ecole Spéciale des Langues Orientales Vivantes, Ecole Nationale et Spéciale 
des Beaux Arts 4 Paris, Conservatoire Nationale de Musique et de Déclamation. Ecole 
Pratique des Hautes tudes. The Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques, at Paris, is a 
private foundation, which ranks with the highest institutions. 
The oldest and greatest of the special institutions was founded about 1530 by 
Francis the First. When this King, imbued with the spirit of the Renaissance, 
sought to foster the new learning in his own Kingdom his project found no favor at 
the University of Paris. Hence a new institution, the Collége de France. It was 
spared by the Convention and has enjoyed uninterrupted progress to the present 
moment. ‘The first professorships here established were those of Greek and Hebrew; 
these were soon followed by professorships of mathematics, philosophy, Latin, and 
rhetoric. From age to age the curriculum of the college has increased with the expan- 
sion of knowledge, and it comprises now forty-one chairs, the latest addition being 
chairs of the history of economic doctrines, modern philosophy, Assyrian philosophy 
and archeology, languages and literature of southern Europe, general anatomy, 
Greek epigraphy and antiquities, and esthetics. 
The Museum of Natural History, which is at present a school for scientific instruc- 
tion and research, had its origin in the Jardin des Plantes, founded by Louis XIII in 
1626. At the request of his chief physician, the King granted letters patent for the 
establishment of a botanical garden, to be under the charge of the physician and his 
successors. It was to serve for purposes of research and demonstration. ‘The scheme 
encountered opposition from the Faculty of Medicine, as the Collége de France had 
from the Faculty of Arts, but with the royal favor it prospered. 
The original purpose was extended little by little, and when Buffon was made 
intendant (1739) he immediately developed plans for the equipment of.a complete 
scientific establishment of high order. In response to his efforts collections poured 
in from every part of Europe and representing equally every domain of nature. 
The genius of Buffon was exercised in the classification of the material and in 
plans for its suitable display. Before his death, which occurred in 1788, the year 
preceding the revolution, he had secured additional grounds and buildings and 
imparted scientific order to the entire work. 
“The revolution,” says M. Dumont, “conceived the foundation of great inde- 
pendent institutions, each devoted to a particular branch of science and enjoying 
absolute freedom.” In accordance with this principle the Museum of Natural His- 
tory was enlarged and endowed with the attributes of a great teaching institution. 
It was organized under its present name in 1793. Two years later the school of Liv- 
ing Oriental Languages was created, and the Bureau of Longitudes, to which the

Origin, classification and functions; the faculties.—The faculties are 
of five orders, 7. ¢., of law, medicine, theology, letters, and sciences. 
They were thus classified in the decree by which they were created, 
namely, the decree for the general .organization of the Imperial 
University (issued by Napoleon March 17, 1808. )   
Observatory of Paris was transferred. Thus, instead of the assemblage of ail studies 
in a common center where they might support and illuminate each other, ‘there was 
isolation, specialization, and a supreme regard to the practical applications of the 
sciences. The synthesis of the sciences was, however, provided for in the Institute 
of France, created in 1796, the year after the Convention was replaced, by the 
Directory. 
Says M. Duruy: “ The institute appeared as a center of information, of research, 
of correspondence, the common asylum of the sciences, letters, and arts. Embracing 
in its extent all the branches of human knowledge formed by the union of all orders 
of knowledge, and all talents, it was certain to be in time, the crown of the scholas- 
tic edifice, the keystone of the system.” (L’instruction publique et la Révolution, p. 
140.) Even here, however, the principle of separation appeared, although, properly 
enough, in the division into three sections, i. e., physics and mathematics, the moral 
and political sciences, and literature and the fine arts. 
The Superior Normal School (Ecole Normale Supérieure) was definitely organized 
under astatute of March 30,1810. The decree creating the Imperial University 
had, however, included a pensionnat normal, which was intended to be a school for 
professors—that is, aspirants for appointment in the higher teaching orders. Such is 
the special funétion of the Superior Normal School at the present time. A proto- 
type was furnished by the normal school established by the Convention in 1794, 
but closed the following year. 
The tendency to separation, so strongly marked during the revolutionary period, 
and the disposition to extend the province of existing institutions which has char- 
acterized the Republic, are both illustrated in the organization of the Ecole Pratique 
des Hautes Etudes. 
In 1868, when M. Duruy, then minister of public instruction, wished to afford stu- 
dents facilities for the practical study of philology and history, he found it impossi- 
ble either to secure or to accommodate all the resources necessary at any one seat of 
learning. There resulted an institution for which the material equipment of exist- 
ing institutions could be called into service, while special provisions were made for 
the new department of study. 
The purpose of the founder is indicated in a single sentence embodied in his report 
(submitted in 1868), in which the plan of the school is unfolded. 
“We must not,” he says, “give to the expression practical school its ordinary 
signification, which implies a school of industrial utility. It is to be taken in the 
most elevated sense, since the work of the eyes and hands is necessary in these 
studies to fix and extend the highest and most delicate conceptions of the scien- 
tific spirit. What is chemistry without manipulation? physics and physiology with- 
out experithents? botany without analysis?” 
In addition to the special schools here considered belonging to the province of the 
minister of public instruction there are important institutions under the charge of 
other ministers. Such are the School of Bridges and Roads ( Ecole des Ponts et Chaus- 
sées) under the minister of public works; the Polytechnic School (Ecole Polytech- 
nique), under the minister of war. 
Detailed accounts of the special schools under the minister of public instruction 
are to be found in the successive Statistiques de V Enseignement supérieur, i. e., 1865- 
1876, 1878-1888. = 
1The law creating the university was passed May 10, 1806, nearly two years 
before the organic decree. (See Recueil des lois et réglements sur Venseignement supérieur. 
Tome I, 1789-1847, pp. 156, 171-88).

EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 19 
The functions of the faculties as specified in the decree were “the 
extension or deepening of science, and the conferring of degrees ” (/ac- 
ultés pour les sciences approfondies et la collation des grades). Three 
degrees were authorized, i. ¢., bachelor, licencié, and doctor; these were 
to be conferred at the end of a public examination, all the conditions 
of candidature being carefully defined. The fact that a degree was a 
prerequisite for nearly all civil offices gave great importance to the 
prerogative of the faculties with respect to conferring these honors. 
According to M. Bréal this was indeed the sole purpose of the faculties 
of sciences and arts. “Napoleon,” he says, “‘ whose conceptions assumed 
inevitably a hierarchical and administrative form, would probably 
never have created faculties of letters and of science, but that it was 
necessary to have some one to confer the diplomas.” ! 
The teaching functions of the faculties were specifically defined in 
regulations issued from time to time, but they had really no practical 
development under. the empire. 
As regards number there were to be as many groups of faculties as 
there were academies or local divisions of the university. The original 
purpose contemplated 26 of these divisions, or as many as there were- 
courts of appeal. Only 23 academies were really constituted; their 
chief cities became the seats of the faculties and gave to them their 
distinctive names. Various readjustments of the academic divisions 
have been made since the fall of Napoleon. By a law of 1854 their 
number was reduced to 16, subsequently increased to 17 by the addition 
of Algiers.” : : 
Subordination; teaching to official orders.—From the nature of the 
university organization it followed that the faculties had none of the 
attributes of self-governing bodies; they were subordinate parts of a 
machinery admirably devised for centralizing the control of education. 
The inferior rank assigned to the teaching as compared with the 
administrative orders in the university is plainly shown by a tabular 
scheme embodied in the organic decree. The officials are arranged in 
two columns, the first pertaining to administration, the second to instruc- 
tion. The teaching orders begin with the faculties at the tenth rank. 
A slight form of organization was given to the individual faculties in 
that each had its own dean, appointed, however, by the grand master. 
The deans are included among the officers of administration, occupying 
there the ninth rank. The faculties, as we have said, belonged to the 
academies, Their official chiefs, the intermediaries between them and 
the grand master, were the academic rectors, who occupied the seventh 
rank in the administration. Supreme over all is the grand master, who 
was appointed by the Emperor. In him was vested absolute control 
of education. If schools were established or instruction given outside

of the university bounds it must be done by the sanction of the chief. 
Such monopoly and centralization had not been dreamed of by the 
revolutionary leaders. They had emphasized the rights of man as 
opposed to the rights of states. Among the rights of man, education? 
was included. The state existing for the service of man was to make 
provision for this universal right. From the subtle conception of the 
state as the servant of man in this particular to the simpler idea of the 
state as a supreme authority in the matter, the transition was easy. 
The revolution had indeed prepared the way by the suppression of 
the old universities and colleges which had often in times past resisted 
the encroachment of tyranny. It is true that immediately after the 
passage of the decree of suppression (1793) new institutions were au- 
thorized, but time and resources were wanting to give them an abiding 
form. Such as were actually created, by their very specialization, pre- 
vented the sense of an independent, but common, mission in the progress 
of humanity. When Napoleon entered upon the scene the need of 
teaching agencies was pressing. He met it according to the dictates 
of an imperial will and with an organization which, as the subsequent 
history proves, was destined to take deep root in the nation. The con- 
centration of power, the hierarchy of officials, the exact prescription of 
functions, the official programmes, the official degrees and titles of 
honor which made up the university system were all well calculated to 
impress a people accustomed to imposing forms in both civil and eccle- 
siastical affairs. The likeness between the university organizationand 
that of the Roman Catholic church has often been pointed out. 
Dr. Biicheler says, in a critical exposition. 
On the one side the most striking feature of this creation of Napoleon appears in 
this, that to it he gave the right of teaching as a monopoly; hence, to no one else 
was this privilege allowed, but every one was forced more or less to receive the in- 
struction of the Université. Thus education and instruction were made entirely an 
affair of the state. On the other hand, however, it is noticeable that he left to the 
Université as little autonomy as possible; rather its whole constitution was such that 
neither independence nor individual activity was possible for the teacher but all 
were brought under one and the same rule. To this end the whole educational sys- 
tem was forced into the net of an administration closely coordinated and welded 
together after the hierarchy of the Romish church. All and each, school-books and 
methods, personal affairs and organization were surrendered to a central authority 
at Paris, the Grand-master and the council of the University of France.—(Schmid’s 
Encyclopedia, article France, p. 580.) 
Reaction against oficialism.—In the period from the fall of Napoleon 
(1815) to the establishment of the Republic (1870) various projects rela- 
tive to higher education were entertained, but no radical changes were

EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 81 
effected. Asregards organization and functions the faculties were sub- 
stantially in 1870 what they had been made in 1808. 
In 1875, July 12, a law was passed relative to the “liberty of superior 
instruction,” which in brief accorded the right of teaching to any person 
who should conform to very easy requirements. One article of this law 
provided that at the expiration of a year the Government should present 
a bill having for its object such reforms in higher education as were seen 
to be necessary. In the course of the debate M. Paul Bert made the 
following statement as to the conditions of the faculties with respect to 
equipments and internal relations: . 
Ido not know what words I could use that might give you an exact idea of the 
buildings in which certain of our faculties of science and of letters. are installed. 
As to other equipments, the collections are miserable. There are no laboratories, 
the libraries are meager. How can it be otherwise, since even the chairs in our 
Jaw faculties have on an average only 65 francs ($13) with which to purchase books 
and heat their halls? Is it true even that at Paris where everything centers, at 
Paris, for which it is said we have sacrificed everything else, there are to be 
found model establishments which make up for the poverty of the provinces? Gen- 
tlemen, it is only_necessary to cross to the left bank of the river and behold the 
condition of these institutions. The condition of the school of medicine has been 
depicted; the condition of the school of pharmacy has been described, but I believe 
no one has spoken of the Sorbonne. It suffices to say that the laboratories and col- 
lections of the Sorbonne are installed in buildings that the city purchased, but, see- 
ing their ruined condition, is about to demolish. It may be said, borrowing the 
severe but authoritative words of Claude Bernard, that the laboratories of Paris are 
the tombs of savants. 
Consider the faculties now in respect to organization—the same miserable state. 
Gentlemen, we have in France forty-three faculties of diverse orders; they are 
distributed in fifteen or sixteen cities and they comprise each four or five professors 
charged to cover the whole domain of the sciences and of letters. In the science 
courses there is scarcely a single student, arid few in those of letters. The profes- 
sional faculties alone have followers and are inspired by the presence of interested 
hearers. The other faculties have no hold upon students, they have scarcely any 
relation with them; they have no interest in the increase of their number and there- 
fore in encouraging their attendance. The faculties are isolated. No common pur- 
poses can be developed among the professors of the faculties of letters and of the 
sciences. 
In France, save at Paris, in France in the country of Burnouf there is not a 
chair of philology; in the country of Champollion there is not a chair of epigraphy 
and of archeology; in the country of Cuvier there is not a chair of paleontology. 
If we consider not the organization only, but the spirit of the instruction, we find 
even a worse state. As a consequence of the incessant surveillance of officials, 
every new doctrine, every original idea is proscribed. We follow, and follow to the 
Jetter, a phrase in the plan of a university traced by M. de Fontanes (first Grand 
Master of the university). “It ought to be,” said he, ‘‘a guaranty against theories, 
pernicious and subversive of the social order.” 
Urgent as appeared the need of reform the project which the law of 
1875 called for was not forthcoming, as we have seen, until 1890. 
Practical reforms.—As explained by the ministers who presented the 
measure to the chambers (M. Léon Bourgeois, minister of public 
instruction, and M. Rouvier, minister of finance) the cause of the delay 
was the determination of the Government to remedy the evils so 
ED 92——6

82 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  graphically depicted by M. Bert and others, and to impart the spirit 
and conditions of university life to the existing establishments, before 
attempting to give them a new form and a new name. 
In the years that have elapsed since the project of reform was au- 
thorized, buildings and equipments have been supplied at a cost amount- 
ing already in 1887 to $22,195,000, of which the cities bore $9,650,000, 
and the state the balance.! 
The annual appropriations have meanwhile been more than doubled. 
In 1870 they amounted to no more than $1,152,773; at that time, says 
M. Falliéres, the faculties very nearly covered their expenses by their 
receipts. In 1878 the credits for superior instruction had increased by 
$787,000; from 1878 to 1888 they were doubled; in 1889 they rose to 
the exact sum of $2,797,071. If from this amount be taken the receipts 
of the faculties, examination, diploma, and entrance fees, there remain 
$1,833,500 from the public treasury. It may be added that in 1892 the 
appropriations for superior instruction amounted to $3,065,718, of 
which $2,331,999 was for the faculties. The het proceeds from the state 
for this year can not be given, as no report has been published of the 
receipts from fees. The increase of the teaching forces has kept pace 
with the other improvements, as will be shown later. 
While the internal life of the faculties has thus been enriched and 
expanded, measures have been maturing for giving them organic 
unity, civil personality, and autonomy. The advice of the faculties 
themselves with respect to the proposed law was sought at the outset 
by a circular letter addressed to them by the minister in order to secure   
1Jn his decennial report (1877-1887) M. Fallitres refers to the new Sorbonne, since 
inaugurated with imposing ceremonies, and notes in addition the enlargement of the 
faculty of medicine at Paris, the construction of the school of pharmacy, the enlarge- 
ment of the museum, and in the departments the following buildings projected or 
begun: Building for the faculty of medicine, of science and letters at Bordeaux, the 
faculty of sciences at Toulouse, the faculties of medicine and of science at Lyons, the 
institution of chemistry in the faculty of science at Nancy, the faculty of science 
at Clermont, the faculty of medicine at Montpellier, the faculties at Caen, and the 
schools of Algiers. In addition to the above, he says, the following are nearly ready 
for operation: ‘‘The faculty of science at Rennes, the new faculty of letters at Tou- 
louse, the faculties of justice and of letters, and the scientific departments of the 
faculties of science and of medicine at Montpellier, the faculties of law and of letters 
at Lyons, and the departments of the faculty of science at Lille. 
Of these buildings, those which belong to the domain have been built entirely at 
the charge of the state; the others, those belonging to the faculties, have been 
erected at the common expense of the state and the cities, sometimes aided by the 
departments. * * * The facades of these new buildings indicate the transfor- 
mations which have been wrought in our superior instruction, but in order to become 
thoroughly informed upon the subject, it is necessary to enter the interior. These 
palaces, whose exteriors, often beautifully ornamented, serve for the passers-by as 
a sign of the dignity of science, are, within, veritable studios, arranged and 
equipped for purposes of instruction and study. But lately, our faculties had only 
lecture halls; at present there are everywhere laboratories for instruction and for 
researches, cabinets, libraries, study and conference halls; everywhere the labora- 
tories, cabinets, and libraries are furnished.”
-P-A-G-E-111
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 83 
the formal expression of their opinions. The measure is thus the out- 
come of large and varied experience and judgment. 
The changes which it is designed ‘to effect in the constitution of the 
faculties are clearly enunciated in the first two articles, to wit: 
ARTICLE I. The universities are public establishments of higher education, whose 
purpose is instruction and culture by all the sciences (lensemble des sciences). 
“They are civil personalities.” ‘‘They are named from the cities in which they 
are located.” 
ArT. II. A university must comprise at least the four faculties of law, medicine, 
sciences, and letters; other establishments of superior instruction may also be incor- 
porated with it at the instance of the minister. 
The remaining articles (thirteen in number) define in detail the 
scholastic and administrative organization of the universities, the 
extent and limitation of their powers, the sources and control of their 
budgets. 
To the foreign student, the most interesting thing about the scheme 
is its adherence to an organic type which is essentially French. Two 
principles nationalized in France by the Revolution and the Imperial 
University are conserved in the new ideal, the principle of state respon- 
sibility in education and of the subordination of teaching bodies to 
civil authorities. To preserve these principles and yet give independ- 
ence to the proposed universities was a delicate problem. Its solution 
is to be found in the measures proposed for maintaining the relations 
of the universities to the central administration on the one hand and 
on the other for transferring certain powers to the universities. These 
measures may be conveniently considered under three heads, the coun- 
cils, the rectors, the control of finances. 
The Councils.—Councils, supreme and academic, were a feature of the 
Imperial University; their functions as determined by the decree of 
1808 were deliberative and advisory, and in certain cases judicial. 
They reflected, however, the will of the central authority, since their 
members were appointed either by the grand master or by the Emperor. 
Transformed into representative bodies by subsequent legislation * 
they have largely substituted the professional for the official influence 
in the conduct of education. The law of February 27, 1880, under 
which the councils are at present organized, allowed 24 elected mem- 
bers out of a total of 60 in the superior council. Eleven of these, 
elected members are chosen from the faculties. In the academic coun- 
cils each faculty is represented by its dean and one member. In the lat- 
ter council all matters pertaining to the local administration of the 
faculties, i. e., expenses, material appliances, promotions, are consid- 
ered, and the conclusions formed are transmitted by the rectors to the 
minister of public instruction, who in turn refers them to the superior 
council. The superior council is, in fact, an advisory body for the 
  
1By a law of March 15, 1850, the superior council comprised 16 elected members 
upon a total of 27; by a law of February 27, 1880, the elective policy was extended 
to the academic councils.
-P-A-G-E-112
  84 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
service of the minister, and has also final judgment in certain cases of 
appeal. Complaint has arisen because the council has no initiative, 
but simply considers the matters submitted by the minister.! 
In reality all matters of importance are thus submitted, and the 
decrees of the minister respecting programmes, the creation of new 
faculties and new chairs, the requirements for degrees, etc., voice the 
matured opinions of this imposing, body. 
In 1885 two important measures were adopted in the interests of the. 
faculties. The first of these, the decree of July 25, revived a right con- 
ferred upon all institutions of publie instruction in 1801, but practically 
nullified asregards the faculties in 1875. This wasthe right to hold prop- 
erty, to receive gifts, and to manage their own estates. The decree 
also permitted funds to be given to the faculties by cities, departments, 
private corporations, and individuals. 
In order that the faculties should exercise this right the same decree 
instituted a general council of the faculties of each académie composed 
as follows: the rector, president, the deans of the faculties, and two 
delegates from each faculty elected by their colleagues. Thus, at once, 
civil personality and organic form were secured. 
A second decree of the same year (December 28, 1885) carried the 
work of organization still further. This decree extended the authority 
of the general council of each group of faculties to all matters pertain- 
ing to the internal conduct of the group, such as the courses and cobr- 
dination of studies, estimates of expenditure, the division of common 
funds, discipline of students, etc. The same decree constituted a coun- 
cil of each faculty composed of the titular or full professors, and an 
assembly of each comprising full professors and agrégés. 
The council was empowered to administer the affairs of the particu- 
lar faculty in accordance with the laws and decrees and subject to the 
approval of the academic rector. The assembly deliberates upon the 
scholastie work of the faculty. The dignity and authority of the dean 
were confirmed by the decree, but the choice of the dean was virtually 
given to the faculties, the minister being authorized to make the ap- 
pointment every three years from two lists furnished, the one by the 
assembly of the individual faculty, the other by the council general of 
the academic group. 
Under the proposed law the academic council ceases to have jurisdic- 
tion over the faculties. The general council of a group of faculties 
becomes the council of the university when the group receives the 
1Says H. Marion: The pedagogical prerogatives of the council, although large, 
are considered by many people toé limited, because the council is merely consulta- 
tive; its advice is given only when demanded; because its members have no initia- 
tive; because, in fine, the minister is not obliged to follow the advice he has sought. 
* * * Jn fact, all the ministers of public instruction have always promulgated 
the projects of decrees and orders submitted to the council in accordance with its 
decisions. (L’Education dans V Université, p. 27. 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. : 85 
benefit of the law. Subject only to the rulings of the minister in ad- 
vice with the superior council of education and to the legal preroga- 
tives of the academic rector, this council becomes the governing body 
of the university. 
The academic rector (an appointee, it must be remembered, of the 
minister of public instruction) will be the administrative head of the 
university of his district. Nominally his position will be the same as 
that of the rectors of the ancient universities, although his authority 
may be less. He will execute the decisions of the university council, 
which must not conflict with the general laws and decrees. 
' The correlation of all grades of instruction is an essential element 
of the French ideal of public instruction. It has not been lost sight 
of in the university project, nor is it left entirely to the superior 
council, which remains unaffected by the proposed law. The removal 
of superior instruction from the academic council has already been 
noted. The unity of scholastic orders thus lost is restored in the local 
administration by the power granted the rector to convoke at his will 
the university council, the council general of faculties (not transformed 
into universities), and the academic council, to deliberate upon the 
common interests of secondary and superior instruction. (Title 11, 
article 15.) 
Control of funds.—Absolute control of their own funds is a power 
which the extreme advocates of decentralization would have vested 
in the individual universities. This policy is, however, not possible in 
the French system so long at least as state appropriations are the main 
dependence of higher education. ‘That this is now the case will readily 
be seen by examining the financial showings. 
The present sources of income, as specified in the bill, are private 
funds belonging to the universities, gifts and bequests of private indi- 
viduals, societies, communes and departments, tuition and examina- 
tion fees, state appropriations. (Title 1, article 2.) 
The income from private property and bequests is as yet a trifling 
sum; tuition and examination fees, which are turned over to the state 
treasury, amounted in 1887 (the latest year for which the data are 
given) to about two-fifths the total income. The state contributed 
then about three-fifths of the income, or $1,354,583 on a total of 
$2,296,540. 
The proposed law following the decrees of 1885 already noted vests 
the control of gifts and legacies in the council of the universities. 
The receipts from tuition fees and the state appropriations will be 
managed as heretofore by special agents appointed by the minister of 
finance. The report of these operations must be submitted each year 
as a part of the report of the expenditures of the department of public 
instruction. 
It should be noted that every organization whose contributions to
-P-A-G-E-114
    86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
~ the support of the university are accepted may be represented in the 
sessions of the university councils in which the financial affairs and 
the annual reports upon the state of instruction are discussed. Cities 
may be represented by their mayors, departments by the presidents of 
their councils, etc. (Title 1, article 12). Thus the sense of a common 
interest and responsibility is stimulated. Should the pending measure 
be carried the number of universities will be less than the number of 
academic divisions, as at least four faculties will be required for organi- © 
zation under the law. Each university will be created by a special 
decree of the council of state, based upon the proposition of the. 
superior council of public instruction. Seven seems to be the largest 
number of universities that the Government is prepared to recognize. 
Without going further into the details of this project, which is likely 
to be much modified during the debate, enough has been said to show 
that it in no way impairs the authority of the state and the organic 
unity of the public teaching and administrative services. 
B.—DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEACHING FUNCTIONS OF THE FACULTIES. 
- It will be interesting at this point to consider the most important 
change that has taken place in the faculties since their origin; i.e., the 
development of teaching functions. To understand this portion of 
their history it will be necessary to go back to the Revolution of 1789. 
Provision for medical instruction after 1789.—After the suppression 
of the old universities (1793) the medical profession was the first to 
make its urgent needs felt. The very next year, 1794, three schools of 
health (Ecoles de Santé) were established to prepare health officers 
(officiers de Santé) for the service of hospitals, and especially for mili- 
tary and marine hospitals. Three additional schools of health were 
created in 1803, and to them all the term faculty was applied by the 
decree organizing the university (March 17, 1808), The subsequent 
history of these schools belongs to that of the medical faculties. 
The necessity of maintaining medical training had also induced indi- 
vidual physicians to open clinics wherever there were hospitals. 
Around these practical demonstrations there grew up courses of theo- 
retical instruction in anatomy, therapeutics, etc. These courses were 
gradually developed into schools and brought under official control. 
In a statute of October 28, 1808, they are referred to “as secondary 
schools of medicine, henceforth to be termed colleges of medicine,” a 
title however which seems to have been seldom employed. 
In 1855 and 1856, apparently under the impulse given by the law of 
1850, which favored the liberty of teaching, several medical schools were 
established, and additions were still made to the number so late as 1880. 
Thus the existence of schools for practical instruction in medicine 
side by side with the medical faculties is accounted for. (See prospec- 
* tus, pp. 92-95). Despite the deplorable condition of this profession,

painted by Fourcroy, councilor of state, in 1802,! it is evident that even 
in the decade immediately following the brief rule of the Convention the 
importance of special medical training had not been wholly ignored. 
Prior to 1875 none of the schools of medicine had the same rank as 
the faculties. Of the four years’ course required for graduation three 
might be taken in the schools, but the fourth year’s enrollment must be 
in the faculty. Exception should be made of two schools of pharmacy 
that were authorized to confer the diploma of a pharmacist of the first 
class. 
By a decree of July 14, 1875, it was ordered that such of the schools 
as fulfilled specified conditions should complete the course of medical 
instructions. Hence the distinction into full-course schools (Ecoles de 
plein ewercice) and preparatory schools. 
Provision for letters and science——The development of advanced 
courses of instruction in letters and in science, that is, courses of a 
higher order than those available in the lycées, whose goal was the 
bachelor’s degree, followed the same line as the professional courses. 
Individual cities began the work, maintaining courses in letters and in 
science according to local demands. By a decree of August 22, 1854, 
the courses established by cities that were not the seat of faculties 
were recognized as preparatory schools of science and letters, and 
the time spent in them was made equivalent to a certain proportion 
of the faculty course. The fact that by the decree mentioned these 
schools were assimilated to the preparatory schools of medicine indi- 
cates that they had arisen in part from the increasing demand for 
scientific knowledge as a preparation for professional studies. This 
inference is confirmed by the tenor of subsequent regulations as well 
as by the programmes of the schools.2 They present courses very 
similar to those of the scientific colleges of our own country. 
Faculty teaching under the Empire.—The characteristics of the schools 
as distinguished from the faculties were equipment for practical instruc- 
tion and teaching professors. Events have proved that they were the 
outcome of a spirit which the faculties themselves could not resist. 
Under the Empire the teaching functions of the faculties were nec- 
18aid Fourcroy: ‘Since the decree of August 18, 1792, which suppressed the uni- 
versities, the faculties, and the learned societies, there are no more regular guaran- 
ties for physicians and surgeons. Complete anarchy has taken the place of the 
ancient organization. Those who have learned their art are confounded with those 
who have not the least notion of it. Almost everywhere licenses are accorded as 
readily to the one as to the other. The lives of citizens are at the mercy of men as 
greedy as they are ignorant. The most dangerous empiricism, the most unblushing 
charlatanism everywhere imposes upon credulity and confidence. No proofs of 
knowledge and ability are required.® Those who have studied during the last seven 
years in the three schools of medicine created by the law of Frimaire, An. 111 (No- 
vember, 1794), can hardly receive any testimonials whereby they may be distinguished 
from the pretenders who are encountered everywhere.” (Exposé des motifs du projet 
de loi sur l’exercice de la médecine, Ventose, An. XI, March 1802.) 
? The number and location of these schools (Ecoles preparatoires d Venseignement des 
sciences et des lettres) are shown in the prospectus, pp. 92-95.  
-P-A-G-E-116
    88 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
essarily in abeyance; even if the conditions had been favorable, the 
number of professors was too small for the work. Outside of Paris 
3 professors only were assigned to a faculty of letters and 4 to a fac- 
ulty of science, or not more than 86 professors for the service of lib- 
eral education in the provinces. The degrees which the faculties 
of letters and of science conferred were sought almost exclusively by 
teachers of the lycées aspiring to the degree of licencié or of doctor 
in letters or science; and the courses which these faculties maintained 
were just sufficient to carry candidates over the interval between the 
successive examinations, as may be seen from the official programmes. ! 
The state of the professional faculties was little better; 4 profes- 
sors sufficed for a faculty of law and 8 for a faculty of medicine. The 
faculties could hardly be said to have even fixed location, for, although 
the chief cities of the académies were their seats, their examinations 
were conducted each year at the centers specified by the grand 
master. Thus everything contributed to foster the purely official 
character of the faculties and to sever them from the intellectual 
life of the nation. Paris alone formed an exception. Here the faculty 
groups comprised a larger number of professors, and for the most part 
professors who were attached to some one of the special schools. The 
spirit of the old university was continued by such men as Delille, Luce 
de Lancival, Delaplace, Boissonnade, in the faculty of letters; Biot, 
Brongniart, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Thénard, in the faculty of science. 
New ideal of a faculty professor.—The abdication of Napoleon (April 
4, 1814), and the restoration of the Bourbons in the person of Louis 
XVIII, was followed by a desperate attack upon the university, in 
which the clergy, many statesmen, eminent writers, and heads of fami- 
lies participated. The assent of the King to a project of decentraliza- 
tion was readily secured and on the 17th of February, 1815, an ordi- 
nance to that effect was promulgated. The sudden return of Napoleon 
put an end to this effort. In the hundred days of his recovered power, 
the university was legally restored. Although attacks upon it were 
renewed after his final overthrow, they accomplished nothing more 
than the diminution of its power. 
This particular part of the university history concerns us here solely 
because the reaction against absolute control proved a great stimulus 
to professional activity. 
Says M. Liard: 
It is at this epoch, however, that our superior instruction, deprived of institutions 
which would have given it a form adequate to its functions, took on another form 
that has become its chief glory. At this moment, sustained and inspired by the 
spirit of liberty, instruction at the Sorbonne became all at once, with Guizot, Cousin, 
and Villemain, an extraordinary manifestatioPof the French genius. To this initia- 
tive, to the influence of these models, is due the origin and the persistence of the 
ideal of a professor of the French faculties.”

EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 89 
M. Taine says: 
During several years in the State chairs at the Sorbonne, M. Guizot, M. Cousin, 
M. Villemain, lectured freely and with great effect before an attentive and enthusi- 
astic throng upon the highest questions of philosophy, of literature, of history.! 
The lectures, which were henceforth a distinguishing feature of the 
faculty careers, were for the most part delivered before mixed audiences 
of hearers and students. For students only, there was generally not 
more than one exercise a week, and this often for no more than four or 
five months in the year. These special exercises were too few, and the 
conditions of the public lectures too distracting for the purposes of 
serious study. Moreover the lecture fervor did not tend to develop in 
the professors an enthusiasm for continuous and detailed instruction, 
and for the intimate interchange of questions and explanation which 
belongs to this work, So late as 1825, the Paris faculty of law advised 
that professors who gave lessons to students should not take part in 
the degree examinations, and this position was confirmed by an order 
from the council in 1829. The order applied also to the faculty of 
science.? Although the faculty of law abandoned its position in 1838, 
declaring that every professor ought to give at least three lessons a 
week,’ the effect of the order was not easily overcome. 
New teaching agencies.—The necessity of increasing the personnel of 
the faculties was not greater than that of infusing into them a new 
spirit. The beginning was made in 1823 by the reorganization of the 
Paris Faculty of Medicine. Twenty-three full or titular professors and 
thirty-six special professors (agrégés) made up the new body. In 1840, 
at the instigation of Victor Cousin, Louis Philippe authorized similar 
reforms in the faculties of law, of letters, and of science. In the report 
which led to the creation of supplementary courses in the law faculties, 
M. Cousin said: 
The agrégés of the school of medicine are a class of professors young and full of 
zeal who represent progress and the spirit of innovation in the school, with, how- 
ever, sufficient guarantees, as the titular professors represent, it may be said, the 
conservative spirit in science, the maintenance of traditional knowledge, and the 
authority of doctrines confirmed by experience.‘ 
Through the success of Cousin’s propositions a veritable teaching 
force was introduced into the faculties. Following this precedent, the 
Republic has greatly increased the number and importance of special 
and assistant professors, while enlarging, also, the force of titular pro- 
fessors. 
In the decennial report for 1877-1887, M. Falliéres, the minister of 
public instruction, says: 
Since 1876 practical courses of instruction to the number of 129, and comple- 
mentary courses to the number of 200¢iave been added, and 201 new professorships 
created.

  The term agrégé, applied to a class of special professors, has no exact 
equivalent in our language. The agrégés are appointed by the minister 
of public instruction from candidates who have gained a doctor’s 
degree, and have successfully passed a competitive examination (agré- 
gation) in a special branch of knowledge. They are assigned to the 
faculties by the minister according to the exigencies of the service. 
They rank immediately after the professors; they may take part in the 
assembly of the faculty (or school), may participate in the degree 
examinations, replace the professors, in their absence giving the regu- 
lar lectures, and conduct conférences or exercises intended to round out 
or complete, in detail, the courses of titular professors. (Decree of 
July 30, 1886.) 
The agrégés are the only class of assistant professors allowed to the 
faculties of law and of medicine, and in these faculties alone are they 
found at present, although they may be assigned to the other orders. 
In the faculties of letters and of science supplementary instruction is 
confided to mattres de conférences and chargés du cours. The distinction 
between these instructors and the agrégés is chiefly that of position. 
The maitres de conférences provided with the doctor’s degree may 
be admitted to take part in degree-examinations and also to a place in 
the assembly of the faculties; the latter is also the privilege of the 
chargés du cours who have the doctor’s degree, but neither of these two 
Glasses of instructors can replace the titular professor. 
The distinction between the two classes of exercises, 4. e., conférences 
and cours, is thus explained by M. Liard: 
Complementary courses—this Word is plain and expresses well what is meant. 
These are courses of instruction in subjects that are not taught by the titulary 
chairs. Thus ina faculty of letters where there is only one chair of philosophy, a 
course of the history of philosophy would be complementary. The conférences are 
different; they were established not only for the purpose of enforcing the instruction 
of the faculties, but especially in order to change the character of the instruction. 
The word conférences came from the normal school. There instruction never was a 
monologue of the professor before passive hearers, it was an active colloquy between 
the teacher and the scholars; the teacher brought his method and his science, the 
scholars their rough-written drafts and oral statements; something in a word as in 
the German universities. This intimate, active, living method of instruction, it was 
desired to introduce into the faculties. Conférences were therefore created, not for 
the general public, but for the true scholars whom the teachers labored to create.! 
Effect of reforms in attracting students.—The great purpose for which 
all these efforts have been made, i. e., the attraction of students, has 
not failed. 
In 1887-88 the number of students in the faculties was 17,630, an 
increase of 7,667, or 77 per cent since 1875. With reference to this 
showing, M, Falliéres says: * 
In this increase there figure two entirely new categories of students—the student 
of science and the student of letters. No farther back than 1876 these were so few 
that they were not mentioned. If some were enumerated in former statistics, it does   
1 Universités et facultés, pp. 53, 54.
-P-A-G-E-119
  
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 91 
not prove that they really studied at the faculties; there were students of law who 
were compelled, for financial reasons, to enroll themselves in the faculty of letters 
without being obliged to follow the courses, and there were candidates for licenses 
who were obliged to enroll themselves in four courses before proceeding to examina- 
tion. At present our 2,358 students of letters and our 1,335 students of sciences 
are real students—permanent pupils of the faculties. - 
The increase has continued since the date of the report. In 1892 the 
total number of students in the state faculties was 22,516, of whom 
9,837 were at Paris. The total includes 400 women, of whom 258 
were French. The statistics for 1893, just published, give a total 
of 23,397 students—10,110 at Paris and 13,287 in the provincial centers 
(Algiers included). The distribution by faculties, Paris and the pro- 
vincial faculties being presented separately, is as follows: Protestant 
theology, 47 (42); law, 3,503 (4,707); medicine, 3,634 (2,836); sciences, 
599 (1,267); letters, 1,230 (1,770); pharmacy, 1,097 (2,665). 
Two features of this increase deserve pene In 1887-88 more 
than half the whole number of students were at Paris; the excess is 
now on the side of the provincial groups. The gain in the number of 
foreign students is noticed with satisfaction by the reporter. The total 
of these in 1892 was 1,397; in 1893 there were 35 more, or a total of 
1,432. 
To recapitulate, the main features of the scholastic organization of 
the faculties are seen to be general courses under titular professors, 
complementary courses, and conférences confided to agrégés, chargés du 
cours and maitres de conférences. The general courses are eithér public 
or closed (fermés), that is, for students only. For students also are 
reserved the complementary courses and conférences. Students are 
enrolled (inserits) as candidates for degrees. This formality takes place 
four times a year, the fee for each inscription being 30 francs or 120 franes 
($24) perannum. There are, besides, the uniform fee of 10 frances yearly 
for the use of libraries, and varying fees for laboratories, apparatus, and 
examinations. In a faculty of ‘science the total tax on a student who 
should secure the three degrees in the regular course would be 470 
francs ($94); in a faculty of law for the certificate of capacity and three 
degrees, 1,955 francs ($391). Numerous scholarships maintained by 
the state, the departments, and the municipalities are offered for com- 
petitive examinations, the fortunate candidates being relieved from all, 
or from a portion, of the fees. 
The growing sense of solidarity among the students is indicated by 
the formation of student societies, of which the chief is the Associa- 
tion of Paris Students (Association générale des facultés et écoles supér-~ 
ieures de Paris). By its attitude toward professors, whom it welcomes 
as honorary members, and by its efforts to secure the representation 
of alumni in the government of the new universities, the association 
fosters the idea that a common life, common purposes, and common 
interests aré the essence of a university. — :  
-P-A-G-E-120
92 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Said M. Lavisse in an address to this association: 
You have had the happy idea of grouping in your society students and teachers. 
This little event is not without importance. It is the visible sign of a transforma- 
tion which is taking place under our eyes, and which, in effect, will substitute for 
the impersonal student and professor, who entertain for each other the cold senti- 
ment that may pass between two abstractions, professors and students living 
together, knowing each other, speaking together, and cherishing toward each other 
the sentiments that unite two beings endowed with form, character, and determined 
spirit.! : 
From the events here reviewed we may estimate td some degree, at 
least, the forces that have caused higher education in France to devi- 
ate so widely from the model first presented to the world by the Uni- 
versity of Paris, ‘‘commonly called the mother of universities.”

  According to the official report! for the year ending August 31, 
1892, accommodation had been provided in schools on the list for Gov- 
ernment inspection for 0,730,888 pupils; the enrollment in these schools 
was 5,037,402 (17:13 per cent of the estimated population), and the 
average attendance 3,892,989. . Comparison at this point with the 
statistics of other countries will be misleading unless it be considered 
that the children in infant schools under 7 years of age are in- 
eluded in the foregoing enrollment. If the number of these (1,493,620) 
be subtracted the enrollment reduces to 12 per cent of the population. 
The establishment and local control of these schools is in the hands of 
(1) school boards (2,331 in number), elected under the school law of 
1870; (2) private managers, chiefly denominational. About 40 per 
cent of the pupils registered are in. board schools. Further statistics 
given in the report relate to schools actually visited by the Government 
inspectors in the year under review (119 less than the number on the 
list), These schools enrolled 5,006,979 pupils, a little more than 99 per 
cent of the entire enrollment. Their average attendance was 3,870,774 
(boys, 2,029,240; girls, 1,841,534), or 77°3 per cent of the enrollment. 
The teaching force employed comprised 99,291 persons, of whom 49-12 
per cent had Government certificates; 23-72 per cent were assistant 
teachers, not certificated, and 27-16 pupil teachers. The proportion of 
women teachers, which has been steadily rising since 1870, was as fol- 
Jows in each class: Certificated, 60-per cent (48 in 1869); assistant, 79 
per cent (60 in 1869); pupil teachers, 78 per cent (57 in 1870). In addi- 
tion to the pupils in day schools, night schools had an average attend- 
ance of 65,561. The total expenditure (day and night schools) was 
$39,919,145, derived as follows: From Government grant, 43-72 per cent; 
local taxes (rates), 20°75 per cent; school fees, 15-65 per cent; voluntary 
subscriptions, chiefly in denominational schools, 19-88 per cent. Of the 
entire expenditure 76:46 per cent was for salaries, 6-18 per cent for 
books and apparatus, 17:36 per cent miscellaneous. The rate of ex- 
penditure per capita of average attendance was $10.22, all schools 
included; in board schools only, $11.75. The ‘total expenditure was 
equivalent to $1.35 per capita of population, and the amount derived 
from public funds (i. e., Government grant and local taxes, $25,769,037) 
to 874 cents.

gives some indications of the effect of this provision. As regards 
expenditure, nothing can be inferred at present, because schools 
accepted the terms at different times, many just at the close of the 
year, and the accounts are not yet adjusted. Of the schools inspected 
15,170 had remitted fees, the number of free pupils on their registers 
being 3,429,577, or 68 per cent of their total enrollment. Since the close 
of the year the number of free schools has increased. At present only 
142 schools have refused the fee grant. The report says: 
It was anticipated that the abolition or diminution of school fees for children 
between 3 and 15 would raise the number of children on the registers, and more 
especially that ofinfants. Thishas been found tobethe case. The number of infants 
has increased by 114,577 (6.94 per cent) and that of older scholars by 67,719 (2.13 per 
cent), and had the statistics now under consideration related to a period of twelve 
months, showing the full effect of the act, the increase shown, both of infants and of 
older scholars, would doubtless have been somewhat larger. But still more satis- 
factory than the increase in the number of children on the books is the increase in 
the average attendance (3.22 per cent), which is, indeed, the special feature of the 
statistics for 1892. This increase is mainly due to the increased regularity of attend- 
ance of the older scholars, for while every 100 infants added to the register increased 
the average attendance by 51 only, there was an addition of 92 to the average attend- 
ance for every 100 older scholars added to the registers during the year. 
The item of average attendance has peculiar importance because the 
whole of the grant for infant schools (i. e., for children 3 to 7), and 96 
per cent of the grant for schools for older pupils (7 to 14), is estimated 
on that basis. In order to share in the grant a school must have had 
at least 400 half-day sessions in the year, and must have afforded 
instruction in reading, writing, arithmetic, drawing for boys, and needle- 
work for girls. Few schools limit themselves to these branches. In 
189192 only 11 per cent of schools for older scholars failed to secure 
the grant for additional subjects, while 90,070 pupils were presented 
for examination in one or two specific subjects which correspond to our 
high-school studies. One-third of this number were in the London 
school board district. The grant for cookery was earned by 90,794 
girls, and that for laundry work by 2,766. Asa result of the regulation 
making drawing compulsory for boys, which took effect September, 1891, 
the number of schools in which the branch was taught rose from 6,075 
in 1890-791 to 17,048 in 1891-92. Manual instruction was given in 285 
schools, science in 513, and physical exercises in 1,703. School libraries 
have been established in 5,560 schools. The training colleges for teach- 
ers under.Government inspection and receiving public grants number 
44 residential colleges and 14 day colleges, having a total of 3,957 
students. The year’s expenditure for these colleges, practice schools 
included, was $970,791, of which 68 per cent was borne by the Govern- 
ment. 
The official report under consideration deals only with elementary 
schools, in which category the training colleges are included. Elemen- 
tary education, however, although the chief, is not the exclusive pro- 
vince of the educational department. It has been brought into relations 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
      100: ' EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
with secondary education through the “endowed schools act,” which 
requires “that every scheme framed by the charity commissioners for 
the management of these institutions shall be submitted to the com- 
mittee of council on education for approval.” Some of the higher 
grade or advanced board schools receiving grarts from the depart- 
ment have also, in part, the character of secondary schools. The report 
also calls attention to the relations of the department with the univer- 
sity colleges which share in the grant of £15,000 annually made from 
the public treasury. 
Each of these colleges sends an annual report and statement of accounts to the 
department, and the treasury officials do not pay the grant to any college until they 
~ have been informed’by the department that the required report has been received and 
examined. 
The department is also brought into direct communication with the 
university colleges through the medium of the day training colleges 
for teachers. All the university colleges that receive a portion of the 
grant above mentioned have established such training schools. These 
schools, first authorized in 1890, give promise of great influence. In 
the report before us, Mr. J. G. Fitch, chief inspector of the training 
colleges for women, discusses their special adaptation to the profes- 
sional training of teachers for secondary schools. Upon this subject 
he says: 
The aspirant to the calling of a secondary or public school teacher may complain 
with reason that however he may desire systematic guidance and preparation before 
entering upon his work, he does not know where to look for it. The existing resi- 
dential training eolleges are not open to him, and the only attempt made in England 
to establish a training institution for secondary schoolmasters proved to be a failure. 
Schoolmistresses have from the first shown a keener perception of the need of pro- 
fessional education than their brothers, but the supply of such training, even for 
them, is lamentably inadequate. The Maria Grey College, at Brondesburg, the Cam- 
bridge Training College for Women, the department for student teachers in the 
famous Ladies’ College at Cheltenham, and the nongovernment department at the 
Home and Colonial Training College, are the only resources known to me by which 
gentlewomen who wish to qualify themselves as teachers in intermediate and higher 
schools can obtain systematic instruction. 
In these circumstances, the establishment of normal departments in the great 
provincial colleges of university rank in England and Wales, and the encouraging 
success which has already been attained in those institutions, open out an oppor- 
tune and most hopeful prospect. It is not likely that new institutions, expressly 
designed like the first two just named, will be multiplied even.for women. Still 
less is it likely that any such institutions will be successfully established for men. 
Nor is it quite clear that it would be desirable. Neither in France or America, nor 
in any country known to me, is it the practice to require special training in a nor- 
mal seminary in the case of candidates for teacherships in higher schools. Such 
Seminaries are indeed needed for primary teachers, because the general education of 
the class from which they are drawn is deficient, and because in fact three-fourths 
of the time spent in those seminaries is required for instruction in language, litera- 
ture, history, and mathematics, subjects which form essential parts of every system 
of general education, and are required in all liberal professions alike. Presumably, 
the young student who is destined to become a teacher in a high school has acquired 
all this in some college or university. What he wants is a special course of peda-
-P-A-G-E-129
  
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 101 
gogic instruction and practice, as a technical supplement to his general studies, 
analogous to that which would be needed if he contemplated law or medicine as his 
career. And this special preparation will probably be best found not in an institu- 
tion composed exclusively of persons whose whole studies are directed by a syllabus, 
and with a view to a professional examination, but in a separate normal department 
in a good general college, wherein for six or twelve months he may devote himself 
mainly to a study of the principles and methods of education, and to systematic ° 
practice under due supervision and criticism in one or more good schools. 
Now, this is precisely the want which the institutions, now newly recognized by 
your lordships as day training colleges, have it in their power to supply.

Statistics, 1892—Effects of the law of 1889 for theremission of fees—Proportion of pupils 
in advanced studies—Effects of award of ‘leaving certificates” —Provision for blind 
and deaf-mute children—Secondary schools under Government inspection. 
Yhe report of the committee of council on education | in Scotland for 
the year ending September 30, 1892, gives the following particulars as 
to the schools under Government inspection. Provision is made for 
752,309 children, an excess of about 76,000 places above the actual 
demand. The accommodation is not perfectly equalized throughout 
the country, and in some few localities there is a call for additional 
accommodation; in others, the extra places are needed for drawing and 
other special exercises. 
The total enrollment was 681,080 (16-78 per cent of the population, 
or deducting the number of children under seven years-of age, i. e., 
136,200, 13 per cent); the average attendance was 549,420. As in Eng- 
land, the local control of elementary schools is in the hands of school 
boards elected under the education law of 1872 or of private managers. 
About 85 per cent of the enrollment is in school-board schools. 
Further particulars relate only to schools actually inspected during 
the year. These had an enrollment of 666,992 pupils and an average 
attendance of 538,678 (80°76 per cent of the enrollment). The night 
schools under inspection had an average attendance of 16,007 pupils, 
showing a continuance of the increase in numbers which has been 
going on since 1890. 
The teaching force comprised 13,690 persons, of whom 60-28 per cent 
held Government certificates, 12-4 per cent were assistants not certifi- 
cated, and 27:32 per cent pupil teachers. 
Since the beginning of the present system (1872), teachers’ salaries 
have been greatly increased, as appears from the following statement: 
The average salary of a schoolmaster (whether principal or assistant) is now 
$662.88, whereas, in 1870 it was $494.88; that of a school mistress was then $270.70, and 
is now $306.25. Besides this, 1,665 masters and 451 mistresses are provided with resi- 
dences free of rent. :

  102 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The expenditure for elementary education (day and night schools) 
was $6,038,754. Of this 73-6 per cent was from Government funds 
(two-thirds from the annual grant and one-third allowed from duties on 
spirits), 21 per cent from local taxes, 3-6 from school fees, and the small 
balance from subscriptions. Fees, as will be observed, have almost 
entirely disappeared under the law of 1889 providing for the remission 
of the same for all pupils of the legal school age, i. e., 5to 14. Less 
than 4 per cent of the pupils paid tuition in the year under review. 
_The total expenditure was equivalent to $10.88 per capita of average 
attendance (in inspected schools), and to an expenditure of $1.48 per 
capita of population. The summary of the reports of the examination 
by the Government inspectors shows. that 79 per cent of the pupils ex- 
amined took one or more studies additional to the three obligatory 
branches, and 8 percent took optional branches, corresponding to our 
high-school studies. ; 
In 1890 the educational department offered a merit certificate as a 
means of inducing pupils to strive for the thorough mastery of ele- 
mentary subjects. The scheme has excited much interest, and 2,346 
certificates have already been awarded. : 
Under a law of 1890 a special grant is allowed to institutions that 
make suitable provisions for the education of blind and of deaf-mute 
children. During the year such grants were authorized through school 
boards in respect to “129 children (80 deaf-mute, 47 blind, 2 both blind 
and deaf-inute). The payments sanctioned.run as a rule from £10 to 
£15 for each child. In some cases an amount for transit has also been 
allowed. An amount below £10 has been sanctioned in one or two 
cases in which the parent can afford to contribute a certain amount but 
can not bear the whole expense. Eleven schools with special provision 
for blind and deaf-mute children are under inspection by the department 
in yarious parts of Scotland. Grants of £3 3s. in each case were paid 
during the year ended 30th September, 1892, on account of 311 scholars 
in these schools whose attainments in elementary or class subjects 
were found to be satisfactory, and of £2 2s. in each case on account of 
270 scholars who made satisfactory progress in some course of manual 
instruction.” : 
The number of secondary schools availing themselves of Government 
inspection is “61, i. e., 24 higher-class public schools, 22 endowed 
schools, and 15 schools under voluntary (private) managers.” The 
~ number offering pupils for the leaving-certificate examination, insti- 
tuted in 1888, was: “Higher-class schools, 55; state-aided schools 
(higher departments), 97; and the total number of candidates present- 
ing themselves for examination from both classes of schools was 7,148. 
The total number of papers taken was 24,240.”

The report of the commissioner of national education in Iveland for 
the year ending December 31, 1892, shows an average enrollment of 
815,972 pupils {17-34 per cent of the population; the deduction of child- 
ren under seven years of age in infant classes would reduce this pro- 
portion by a least four hed cent), and an average attendance of 495,254 
(243,504 boys, 251,750 girls), or 60-7 per cent of the enrollment given.! 
There were also 1,928 pupils in average attendance upon the evening 
schools during the year. 
The total teaching force in the employment of the commissioners at 
the end of the year comprised 12,250 persons, i. e., principals, men, 
4,685; women, 3,508; assistants, men, 885; women, 9,997; temporary 
assistants, industrial teachers, etc., 83. There were also 5,336 paid 
monitors (boys, 1,725; girls, 3,611). As explained in the report, these 
“monitorships are practically scholarships open to the pupils of the 
" schools in which they are educated. ‘They are the rewards of efficiency 
on the part of the teachers, and of industry, ability, and good attend- 
ance on the part of pupils.” 
The five training colleges under Government inspection enrolled 674 
students, of whom 349 were men and 325 women. They received 
grants from the Government to the amount of $100,179.60. 
The income of the schools, from all sources, amounted to £1,104,465 
9s. 1d. ($5,294,329). Of this amount 86-4 per cent was from Goyern- 
ment funds and the remainder from local sources. The total income 
was equivalent to £2 5s, 34d. ($11) per capita of daily average attend- 
ance. : 
By the education act of 1892 parents were in whole or in part 
relieved of the payment of school fees for their children. In accord- 
ance with this provision the school fees paid by pupils were abolished 
from October 1, 1892, in schools where the average rate of fees received 
during the year 1891 had not exceeded 6 shillings a year for each child 
of the number of children in average daily attendance. _In schools 
where the average rate had exceeded that sum the fees to be charged 
were not to be such as to make the average rate exceed for any year 
the amount of the said excess. 
The commissioners report that ‘7,173 schools were declared to be 
absolutely free on the ist of October om the imposition of school fees. 
In the remaining 1,071 schools, the excess fee that may be charged 
under the act was only 2s. 73d. per pupil on the average.”

extra or optional subjects corresponding to high-school studies in our 
own country. : 
The statistics do not enable us to give the number of pupils in 
branches beyond the three elements. It appears, however, that more 
than half the pupils pursued grammar and geography. In needlework 
158,555 girls were examined, and in agriculture 79,260 pupils. These 
were exclusive of 546 pupils in schools having experimental gardens 
and a special course in agriculture.

  INTRODUCTION. 
The report of the Commissioner of Education for 189091 contains a 
brief account of measures affecting technical instruction in Great 
Britain, especially the recent laws pertaining thereto, i. e., the technical 
instruction act, Scotland, 1887, empowering local authorities to estab- 
lish technical schools and authorizing the levy of a tax not exceeding 
a penny in the pound for the support of the same, a similar law for 
England in 1889—amended 1891, and in 1890 the local taxation (cus- 
toms and excise) act, which placed about $3,500,000 at the disposal of 
the county councils (England and Scotland) with the privilege of 
applying the same to technical instruction. Since the date of the 
report referred to, new agencies have been established for giving effect

106 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
to the laws relative to this interest, and existing agencies strengthened 
and expanded. The movement is so important, and is developing so 
rapidly that a fuller account of its causes and operations than was 
possible in the preceding report, seems desirable. Since that volume 
was issued the only legislation on the subject has been a new technical 
instruction act for Scotland (1892), giving larger liberty to local anthor- 
ities than did the law of 1887. These several laws, and the practical 
measures resulting therefrom, are the outcome of agitations and efforts 
dating from the exposition of 1851. The effect of that exposition in 
rousing attention to the lack of the artistic element in English manu- 
factures is well known. The superiority of continental goods over 
those of England in this respect could not be ignored, and was attrib- 
uted to the superior provision made by continental countries for sci- 
entific and artistic training. The necessity of multiplying science and 
" art schools for the benefit of English artisans was at once recognized. 
The royal commission appointed in 1881 to investigate the status of 
technical instruction in various countries pointed out many subjects, 
both of scientific and’ technical training, in respect to which the provi- 
sion in England was still far inferior to that of continental countries. 
The immediate effect of the report was to stimulate efforts for over- 
coming this inferiority in the chief manufacturing centers of England. 
Nevertheless, after the lapse of ten years it does not appear that these 
scattered enterprises have fully met the demands; such, at least, is the 
opinion expressed by various committees that have recently inyesti- 
gated the conditions. The importance of local action in this matter, 
however, is not likely to be undervalued in England, where local initia- 
tive is always made the basis of Government action. The recent laws 
simply empower and foster local action, and make provision for supple- 
menting local resources by appropriations from the public funds. Asa 
“result of the distribution of the surplus derived from the duties on 
liquors (Customs and Excise Act), every county has been made a. dis- 
trict for the organization of technical instruction. In every manufac- 
turing town, the resources of existing schools are being increased or 
new schools arising, while the leaders of the movement are working 
zealously to insure the adoption of the best schemes of instruction, a 
wise gradation or codrdination of the various technical schools and 
classes, and the judicious application of the funds that the public 
treasury annually yields to the work, 7. ¢., $2,570,000 through the 
science and art department and $3,800,000 from the surplus of duties 
on spirits. 
The interest that the subject excites is also reflected in measures 
relating to elementary and secondary instruction. Thus in 1890 the 
education department announced that the time devoted to drawing and 
manual training might be counted in making up the estimates of aver- 
age attendance. This was in line with the action of the science and art 
department, which offered the same year a grant upon results of exam-
-P-A-G-E-135
  
| 
TECHNICAL ee IN GREAT BRITAIN. 107 
ination in manual work. | In 1891 the education department made 
drawing compulsory for boys, the order to take effect after August 31 
of that year. The intimate relation between technical and secondary 
instruction is emphasized in all public measures pertaining to the latter. 
It is manifested in the proposed new regulations for evening schools,! 
which are intended to give greater freedom of choice in respect to studies 
and to make provision for both science and technical courses. 
The same relation is kept in view in the efforts for the organization 
of secondary instruction,wLich have resulted in a bill lately submitted 
to Parliament. q 
As to the actual state of technical instruction in Great Britain, it 
would be impossible to form a just estimate without careful study of 
the work in every county. Reports of operations in the chief cities, 
however, help to give a clearer impression of the movement that has 
permeated the entire country than can be formed from general state- 
ments. For this reason summaries and extracts from recent reports 
on the subject are appended. These relate (1) to general agencies 
for fostering technical instruction; (2) to local’ agencies and schools. 
The latter differ so widely in their character and the reports which are 
available are so varied in scope and arrangement as to preclude any gen- 
eral plan in the selection of particulars, such as might facilitate compar- 
isons. It may be observed, however, that local technical schools are 
organized with special regard to local industries and their courses of 
study almost always arranged with reference to the examinations 
of the science and art department, which disburses the annual appro- 
priations from the public treasury for science and art instruction. This 
grant amounted in 1891-92 to $2,578,750. 
The conclusions of the commission of 1881 were republished in the 
report of this office (1882~’83). Their repetition in part at this time 
seems desirable in connection with the views of recent committees 
appointed for similar investigations. These opinions, set forth at the 
interval of a decade, afford an insight into the industrial needs of 
England, and into the educational policy relating thereto, of great 
interest to our own people. Citations from the sources indicated are 
therefore appended to the summaries of current operations.

REPORT OF OPERATIONS UNDER RECENT LAws. 
In December, 1892, the committee of council on education addressed 
a circular letter of inquiry to the local authorities empowered to make 
provision for technical instruction, requesting information as to the 
extent to which the funds accruing under the customs and excise act 
(amounting for the year to about $3,800,000) had been applied to tech- 
nical instruction, and the nature of the provision created or fostered 
thereby.

No returns received from Ross and Cromarty Counties. No returns received from Annan and Whithom. dNo returns received from Bonnyrigg, Cove and Kilereggan, and Johnstone. eOne not yet decided (Great Grimsby). 
  The operations of the county and county borough councils in England and Wales 
are in many cases carried out by technical education committees, to whom the 
councils have delegated their powers (except the power of raising a rate or borrow- 
ing money) under subsection 1 (2) of the technical instruction act, 1889. Organ- 
izing secretaries or directors of technical education have been appointed in the great 
majority of counties and in some of the county boroughs. Several of the county 
councils (Cheshire, Stafford, etc.), have, evidently with a view to stimulate local 
effort, made grants to urban sanitary authorities on condition that the latter levy a 
tax (rate) or contribute a sum out of the rates, under the technical instruction act, 
1889, or provide funds from other local sources to supplement such grants. 
A noticeable feature with regard to the work of the county boroughs is that many 
of the councils have either erected, or decided to erect, technical schools, or have 
taken over existing schools for the purpose of supplying technical instruction under 
their direct control, to which they have decided to apply the whole of the funds at 
their disposal, in some cases including the proceeds of a local tax levied under the 
Jaw of 1889. 
It appears from the returns that the promotion of technical instruction in Scot- 
land is progressing, though slowly. Technical education committees have been 
formed, particularly in the counties, and in one case (the county of Aberdeen) an 
organizing secretary has been appointed to arrange and supervise instruction. Most

of the county councils devote the whole or part of the residue to the purposes of 
technical education, but the majority of the sporehe still apply the money to the 
relief of rates. 
NATIONAL AGENCIES FOR tou oine TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION. 
In 1891 an association was formed, styled the National Association 
for the Promotion of Technical and Secondary Education.! 
The objects of the association were to encourage “the educational 
reforms which will improve the capacity in a broad sense of all those 
upon whom our industries depend.” One of the measures adopted 
for accomplishing this parpose was the diffusion of information in a 
cheap and popular form. To this end the association has published 
a bimonthly journal, i. e., The Record of Technical and Secondary 
Education, which keeps the public fully informed on the subject. In 
the same year (1891) another association, was formed, having a more lim- 
ited and more definite scope. This was the association of organizing sec- 
retaries, i. e., officers appointed by county councils to carry out the provi- 
sions of the technical instruction acts, and to msure the most economical 
use of the Government funds which were ailowed for the work. This 
was a very important step toward the systematic organization of the 
agencies for technical instruction. The association is truly national, 
nearly every county in England and Wales being represented therein.

LONDON. 
Population (1891), 4,211,056. 
Enroliment in elementary schoots, 1891-92, 678,000 (board schools, 465,000; voluntary 
schools, 213,000). Average pee 527,000 (board schools, 362,000; private 
or voluntary schools, 165,000). Number of elementary pupils examined in secondary 
studies, 30,977 (board schools, 23,639; voluntary, 7,338). 
A return of the charity commissioners appointed to reorganize the 
“parochial charities of the city of London” enumerates 46 ‘“ metropoli- 
tan institutions connected with technical education.” These include 
schools and classes of such widely differing character as Dr. Barnardo’s 
Homes for Friendless Children and higher schools organized for the 
sole work of technical instruction. South Kensington Normal and 
Art School is the only one of the number which draws its support 
from the Government, and since its students (ome from every part of 
Great Britain, this school does not, strictly speaking, belong to Lon- 
don. The remaining 45 institutions. are supported by endowments, 
subscriptions, fees, and in a few cases, municipal grants. 
The most important of the private agencies for technical instruction 
is the City and Guilds of London Institute, which was formed in 1876 
by an association of the livery companies of the city. It has been the

chief promotor of technical education in the metropolis, and has also 
extended its influence and support to other cities.. The Institute pos- 
sesses in London at present three schools, i.e., the Central Institu- 
tion for Advanced Instruction in Applied Science, Finsbury Institute 
or Technical College, and the South London School of Art. 
The departments and numerical strength of the staff in each school 
are as follows: 
_ Central Institution.—Mechanics and mathematics, 3; engineering, 
5; physics, 5; chemistry, 5. 
Finsbury Technical College-—Mechanical engineering and applied 
mathematics, 7; applied physics, 7; applied chemistry, 4; applied art, 
6; trade classes, 5. 
The South London School of Technical Art is in charge of a super- 
intendent of studies and 7 instructors. 
From the report of 1892 it appears that the institute had in its own 
schools 1,560 students, distributed as follows: Central, 199; Finsbury, 
198 day, 1,017 evening; Art School, 146. 
The chief work of the institute, in addition to the maintenance of 
these schools, is the support of examinations. 
At the examination in manual training, held for the first time in 1892, 
and restricted to teachers in public elementary schools, 615 candidates 
presented themselves, of whom 350 passed. The examination was 
held at 29 centers throughout the country. 
The council state in the same report that— 
They have long felt that for the further improvement of technical teaching, a 
system of inspection by educational authorities and trade experts was necessary, and 
they are at last able to take the initial steps in organizing such a system. As a 
practical beginning of the work, the institute undertook during the year, the inspec- 
tion of some of the classes of the Merchant Venturers’ School, Bristol, and the exam- 
ination and inspection of special classes at the Municipal Technical School, Birming- 
ham. They have also examined and reported upon the woodworking classes in the 
county of Southampton, and at the request of the technical instruction committee of 
the Kent County council, they have prepared suggestions for the guidance of teachers 
at evening classes in woodworking, which they hope may give direction to and 
improve the teaching of that subject. 
In 1888 the Institute gave its aid to the establishment of manual- 
training classes in the elementary schools of London, appointing a joint 
committee to cobperate with the school board in the conduct of the 
same. . 
Practical housework has since been added to the subjects under 
charge of this committee. 
Rooms were fitted up in one of the board schools, one as a bedroom, one as a 
sitt'ng or day room, and one for general work (kitchen, etc.). These rooms are 
furnished similarly to those of a workman’s home; and girls are instructed every 
Saturday in the various duties—bed-making, preparation of fires, cleaning of grates, 
black-leading, dusting, scrubbing, polishing, washing of tea things, setting of 
tables for various meals, ete.

TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 111 
  The income of the Institute for the year under review amounted to 
£33,093 18s. 9d. ($160,836), not including £300 ($1,450) assigned to 
scholarships by the Clothworkers’ and Saddlers’ Company out of their 
subscriptions to the Institute. Of the total income, 28 per cent only 
was derived from students’ fees and payments for material. The large 
proportion (72 per cent) was from subscriptions and donations. 
The council of the Institute anticipate decided modifications in their 
plans of work as new agencies are created for similar purposes. 
Among these agencies the most important are the polytechnic institu- 
tions, for whose maintenance large sums have been appropriated from 
the funds of the city parochial charities. The council of the Institute 
urge the importance of such an organization of the new corporation 
agencies as shall secure to London a graded system of technical 
instruction codrdinated with elementary schools on the one hand, and 
on the other with the higher or more specialized training supplied by 
the college of the Institute. 
The Polytechnics.—In 1883 an act was passed providing for the reor- 
ganization of the city of London Parochial Charities, and empowering 
the charity commissioners to devise schemes for giving effect to this pur- 
pose. The aggregate annual income of the charities which the com- 
missioners deal with is £118,602 ($576,400), 
Naturally in the present state of public feeling, technical education 
has engaged the attention of the commissioners. The most important 
scheme which they have evolved in this interest is that for the appro- 
priation of £15,000 annually to the support of five polytechnies in 
different sections of the city. These are to be modeled, so far as may 
be, on the plan of the Polytechnic in Regent street, started some years 
ago by Mr. Quinton Hogg. Of this unique institution the charity 
commissioners give the following account: 
Mr. Quinton Hogg having remarked that at the Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tion only clerks were admitted, determined to found one for workmen and appren- 
tices. As this is a poorer aan he gave up from the first the attempt to make it 
self-paying. 
The first experiment was tried at Castle street, Long Acre, and the results having 
proved satisfactory, arrangements were made to secure the remainder of the lease 
of the Polytechnic in Regent street, which thus gave a name to the new institution. 
As it was resolved to admit no boys as members under the age of 15, the Castle 
street premises were retained, to serve as an institute for younger boys, and there _ 
they still remain. 
The remarkable feature of the Polytechnic is that it aims at improving boys from 
four different sides at once, viz: the religious, the social, the mental, and the phys- 
ical. So comprehensive an attempt hardly exists elsewhere, and it is to this thor- 
oughness and completeness that the success of the institution isin part due. The 
religion here is of an evangelical type, and after seeing the Sunday services, no 
doubt can be entertained that it is of great good, not merely from a Christian point 
of view, but in improving the general social tone. The institution may be divided 
into two sides, the club or recreational side, and the educational or school side. It 
is thus a club and a school fused together.
-P-A-G-E-140
112 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  (1) The club side.—On this side there are 3,500 members, this being all that the 
rooms will hold; but the applications for admission are so numerous that this num- 
ber could be largely augmented. The members belong chiefly to the artisan class. 
The subscription is 3 shillings per quarter, payable in advance, entitling members, 
amongst other advantages, to free use of the library, reading, social, chess, and 
draught rooms, the use of one of the finest gymnasiums in London, admission to 
the concerts, entertainments, lectures, etc., aud the privilege of joining any of the 
classes at greatly reduced rates. 
The gymnasium is fitted up with all necessary appliances, and is under the man- 
agement of a color sergeant and sergeant who attend every evening to give instruc- 
tion. Leaders are chosen from the members. The subjects taught are fencing, 
dumb-bell exercise, vaulting horse, parallel and horizontal bars, boxing, flying 
trapeze, hand rings, etc. 
There are about 1,800 members paying for the use of lockers, with an average 
attendance.of about 200 each evening. 
The locker room contains 1,800 lockers, for which a charge is made of 1s. 6d. per 
half year. 
Instruction is given every day to the school boys in gymnastics and drill. 
The social room is a large room reserved for the use of members for social inter- 
course. Chess and draughts, papers, etc., are provided. There is also a refresh- 
ment bar where refreshments can be obtained at moderate prices. 
The club room leads out of the social room, and is reserved for committee meet- 
ings, ete., of the various societies formed amongst the members. 
The library contains about 8,000 volumes, and is open every evening for the loan 
of books to members without charge. 
The reading room, reserved for members only, is supplied with most of the prin- 
cipal papers. 
Entertainments, lectures, concerts, etc., are given during the season, and are held 
in the large hall and small lecture hall. 
There are also several subsections and societies held in connection with the poly- 
technic. Each society is composed of members of the institute, and is managed by 
a committee elected by its own members: 
Attached to the institute is one of the finest swimming baths in the kingdom; it 
is reserved for members and friends after 6 p. m., for which a charge of 3d is made. 
Lavatories, hot, and shower baths, and a hair cutting and shaving saloon are pro- 
vided for members. a‘ 
The recreation ground is situated at Merton Hall, Wimbledon, and consists of a 
house and about 27 acres of ground. Dressing, and all necessary, rooms are provided. 
The name of the athletic club is the Hanover United Athletic Club, which com- 
prises the following sports:

  There is also a cycling club, a harrier’s club, and a rambler’s club. 
The rambler’s society is instituted for the purpose of providing regular Saturday 
afternoon cheap excursions to places of interest in the country around London, and 
to thus furnish a means of healthful enjoyment and social intercourse amongst 
members of the institute not otherwise engaged on the half holiday. 
(2) The educational side.—The classes held are divided into the following groups: 
A. A day middle-class school, 343 students. 
B. Day classes, 200 students.
-P-A-G-E-141
   
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN, 113 
©. Evening classes, 3,000 students; (1) Technical (theoretical classes); (2) Prac- 
tical workshop classes; (3) Science and art classes; (4) General and commercial 
classes; (5) Musical classes. 
The numbers of students given are the present numbers December, 1886. This 
time of year is about the worst for attendance, which is about 15 per cent higher in 
the spring, that is to say, the yearly average is about 7} per cent higher than the 
autumn numbers. 
The annual expenditure for this polytechnic is about £6,500, of which 
about £3,000 is raised by fees and grants from the city guilds. The 
balance has heretofore been met by Mr. Quinton Hogg. This ainount 
will be about covered by £3,500 from the charity commissioners. : 
The fear that the London council might fail to appropriate any por- 
tion of the fund coming to them from the liquor duties to technical 
instruction was relieved by the resolution of the council adopted April 
2, 1892, “to appoint a committee empowered to draw up a scheme for 
technical education in London. At the same time by a majority of 64 
to 39, the council carried £30,000 to a suspense account in order to pro- 
vide the committee with the means to carry out its scheme for the cur- 
rent year.” 
The sum allowed, i. e., $145,800, is small in comparison with the total 
receipts of the council ($816,480) from the beer and spirits duties for the 
year. This first appropriation, however, is intended only for prelimi- 
nary expenses, since grants can not be made until after the committee 
has submitted a definite report. 
BRISTOL. 
In the southwestern part of England (on the Avon). Population (census of 1891), 
221,665. 
A technical school has recently been established at Bristol which 
was intended to possess the features of similar schools on the conti- 
nent and yet be adapted to che special requirements of its own nation 
and locality. The enterprise is due to the Society of Merchant Ven- 
turers, whose name the school bears. Prior to the opening of the 
technical school in 1885, the Bristol Diocesan Trade School had been 
established; this became the nucleus of the larger institution. 
DEPARTMENTS, 
There are three distinct branches of the institution: (a) the boys 
school; (+) the upper technical school; (¢) the evening school. 
(a) The boys’ school is itself subdivided into a lower and a middle 
school. In the lower school, boys from 9 to 13 receive teaching in ordi- 
nary English subjects and also in the rudiments of foreign languages, 
art, drawing, and natural science. It is not intended to continue this 
part of the work, but to abandon it gradually as the present accommo- 
dation for higher work becomes more and more inadequate to meet the 
demand. The middle school (for boys from 12 to 16) has two sides—a

The fees in the boys’ school vary from £5 to £6 10s. a year. 
(b) The upper (technical) school is for day students over 15 years 
of age, without distinction of sex. The school is divided into the 
following sections: Mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, 
chemical and metallurgical, applied art and building trades. There is 
also a special “‘ university ” section for students preparing for the degree 
of B. sc. of the University of London. Twenty-six per cent of the 
present students are women. The inclusive fee for the upper school is 
£10 10s. a year. The ages of the students. vary from 15 to 62; the 
average age being 184. 
(c) The evening school is intended mainly for artisan and commer-

cial students of either sex. The classes are divided into the following 
departments: 
I. Science, including mathematics, theoretical mechanics, applied mechanics, 
steam, building construction and drawing, machine construction and drawing, navi- 
gation, theoretical and practical chemistry (organic and inorganic), metallurgy, 
(theoretical and practical), sound, light, heat, magnetism, electricity, practical plane 
and solid geometry, hygiene, botany, and zoology. 
II. Art, including drawing, painting, modelling in clay, wood carving, designing, 
ete. 
III. Technology, including boot and shoe manufacture, carpentry and joinery, 
plumbing, metal working, photography, dressmaking, millinery, electric lighting, 
mechanical engineering, and telegraphy. 
IV. Commerce, including French, German, Spanish, commercial arithmetic, and 
geography, bookkeeping, and shorthand. = 
VY. Classes in preparation for the examinations of London University. 
VI. Ambulance and nursing lectures are given as well as an annual series of pop- 
ular penny lectures. 
STAFF. 
  There are 48 teachers in the institution, of whom 12 are graduates. 
Two are specialists in engineering subjects, 4 in chemistry and metal- 
lurgy (1B. sc., London; 1 pH. D., Munich; 1 pH. D., Erlangen); 3 in 
physics (1 Mm. A., Aberdeen; 1B. sc., London); 4 in modern languages 
(1 mM. A., Oxford; 1 m. A., London; 1 PH. D., Marburg); 2 in mathe- 
matics (1 B. A., Cambridge; 1B. sc., Victoria); 2 in commercial sub- 
jects (1 B. A., London); 2 in biology (1 B. sc., London); 6 in art, and 
15 in the various branches of technology. 
FINANCE. 
The school is not self-supporting. In recent years the excess of 
expenditure over income has amounted to about £1,900 a year, and 
this sum, therefore, represents the annual cost of the echool to the Soci: 
ety of Merchant Venturers. 
NUMBERS AND GROWTH. 
The growth in the attendance of the school is proof of the value which 
the citizens of Bristol place upon its privileges. The enrollment in 
1890 and 1892 was as follows:

SCHOLARSHIPS. 
Until September, 1891, the only scholarships tenable in this school 
were: 9 scholarships tenable for three years and covering tuition fees 
and cost of books; 4 scholarships in the upper school tenable for two 
years at an annual value of £25, and 1 of £20 annual value tenable also 
for two years.

The report from which the foregoing particulars have been derived 
states further that there is a larger demand for the pupils of the upper 
part of the school than it is possible to supply. Most of the leading 
manufacturers and merchants of Bristol recruit their staffs from pupils 
of the school. 
The Record of July 1892, contains the following description of the 
building: : 
BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENTS. 
The erection of the building and the purchasé of the fittings and apparatus have 
involved an outlay of £45,000. For this sum®uildings have been provided which 
in themselves constitute an object lesson in construction, every part being built in 
a solid and serviceable manner. Nor is beauty overlooked; the main staircase is of 
marble throughout, while the woodwork is of the best pitch pine, except in the 
great hall, which has a carved oak ceiling, as well as artistic oak paneling. The 
school contains a great hall for popular lectures, examinations, etc., to accommo- 
date 900 persons; nine ordinary class rooms, a large chemical lecture theater (for 
108 students at a time), a smaller chemical theater, a physical lecture theater (for 
108), an engineering lecture room (for 56), an engineering drawing office (for 48 ata 
time), two chemical laboratories (for 50 at a time), a balance room, combustion 
room, gas analysis room, physical, metallurgical and biological laboratories, boot 
and shoe workshop, metal workshop, carpenter’s workshop, forge, plumber’s work- 
shop, two art rooms, dressmaking and millinery room, library, engine house, ete. 
Each department is fitted out with the latest appliances for teaching and for practi- 
eal work. 
BIRMINGHAM. 
County Warwick, in the northwestern part of England. Population (1891), 429,171. 
Enrollment in elementary schools, 86,131 (board schools, 55,511; voluntary, 30,620). 
Average attendance, 72,491 (board schools, 47,628; voluntary, 24,863). 
To the munificence of a private citizen, Sir Josiah Mason, Birming- 
ham is indebted for Mason College, which was founded in 1880 as a 
college for instruction in practical science, but has since developed into 
a university college, with a special leaning towards science. The his- 
tory of this institution proves conclusively the importance of suitable 
provision for the preparatory stages, if higher grades of scientific and 
technical training are to be maintained. Notwithstanding ample 
resources and a strong faculty, this institution has not accomplished 
the ends which its founder had most at heart. Its possession, however, 
has given Birmingham some advantage in entering upon the new 
movement. The city council was one of the first to adopt the tech- 
nical instruction act of 1889, and, after some preliminary measures, 
appointed (January, 1891) a cominittee for practical work under the 
act. This committee advised the adoption of the science classes of the 
Birmingham Midland luistitute, which, in accordance with the plans of 
the committee, have been developed into the Birmingham Municipal 
Technical School. The city council authorized the committee to spend 
$7,190 in apparatus and fittings, and $4,860 in additions and alterations 
to the building. & 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  The school opened under the new auspices September 14, 1891, and 
so great was the number of students applying that in some cases twice, 
and even thrice, as many applied as there was space for. This unex- 
pected difficulty was met in part by duplicating the classes, and it was _ 
found possible to fit up a few additional places in the laboratories. 
But with all this contriving some students had to be turned away for 
want of room. In this emergency an additional building was secured 
on a 3 year’s lease, at the expiration of which it is hoped that the 
school will take permanent possession of a new building. The total 
nuinber of students for the session 1891-92 wes 1,187. The committee 
being anxious to know to what extent their students come from outside 
the city, have made inquiry into the subject, and find the following 
results as regards 1,062 students:

and advanced), geology, geometry, iron and steel manufacture, machine construction 
and drawing, magnetism and electricity, mechanics (theoretical and applied) metal- 
lurgy, metal plate work, mineralogy, petrology, plumbing (mechanical), sanitary 
science, sound, light, and heat; steam, telegraphy, and telephony, typography, white 
metals (mechanical).” 
The annual session lasts about eight and a half months. 
All the classes are open to both male and female students not under 12 years 
of age. 
The preparatory courses and the elementary courses are open to all applicants. 
The advanced and honors courses are only open to those students who have previously 
gone through the elementary and the advanced courses, respectively, of those sub- 
jects for which they make application. 
The tuition fee for each complete trade course is 10 shillings a session. 
Each course is for two years. In the preparatory and science classes 
the aim is to keep the fees as low as possible. The city council have 
also “decided that some proportion of the admissions (not exceeding 
one-fourth) shall be free, a competitive examination being held for these 
scholarships.” 
The following description of the laboratories and workshops of the 
school is taken from the report of the school for 189293: 
Chemical laboratory.—The chemical laboratory will accommodate 54 students work- 
ing at one time, allowing 4 feet for each student, and is well provided with fume 
chambers, balances, and apparatus. Every facility is given to students who wish 
to pursue their studies beyond the ordinary courses, whether in the direction of pure 
or applied chemistry. 
Physics laboratory.—The physics laboratory will accommodate 20 or 30 students 
working at a time, and is furnished with apparatus for experimental demonstrations
-P-A-G-E-147
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 119 
and measurements. While the best of instruments will be provided for exact work, 
the students will be encouraged to take themselves simple apparatus that will serve 
for general purposes. 
Metallurgical laboratory.—The metallurgical laboratory is the largest in the king- 
dom and fitted with working tables especially designed for the work to be done on 
them. Each student is supplied with a locker, in which are provided all the tools 
and vessels he requires, the only obligation being that he should leave them in as 
good working order at the end of the course as he found them at the beginning. 
ELlectro-metallurgical laboratory.—The electro-metallurgical laboratory has a large 
room, which will accommodate 25 students working at one time, and is furnished 
with work tables fitted with lockers, each containing suitable apparatus for indi- 
vidual use. The laboratory is also equipped with appliances for general use, 
consisting of reagents, plating vats, polishing and scratch-brush lathes, press, gal- 
vanometers, voltmeters, ameters, resistance-boards, dynamos, etc., so as to afford 
every facility for the student to make himself acquainted with the scientific princi- 
ples involved in the art of electro-deposition. This laboratory is also lighted by 
electricity. The classes in metal coloring and bronzing are also conducted in this 
laboratory. 
Machine shop.—The machine shop or engineering laboratory for manual] instruction 
in the use of tools is designed to meet the requirements of those engaged in the iron 
and steel and engineering trades, and, as far as space will permit, is fitted with the 
most approved form of machinery and tools. Among other things there are a 
12-horse-power gas eugine, 5 screw-cutting lathes, drilling, planing, milling, and 
shaping machines, 2 ordinary slide rest lathes, work benches with leg and par- 
allel vices, etc. The whole shop will accommodate upwards of 30 students work- 
ing at one time. 
Bras shop.—The brass shop is thoroughly provided with the lathes, tools, etc., 
required for the practical instruction of a brass founder or anyone engaged in a 
similar line of business. ‘Che student is instructed in the use of power and foot 
lathes, filing, screwing, pattern-making, core-making, casting, soldering, tool- 
making, aud chasing. In connection with this shop is a well appointed casting 
shop, where the student is taught not only to make the mold with sand, but also 
to melt the brass or bronze, etc., in a full-sized furnace, and pour it into the mold. 
The castings thus made may be afterwards worked up in the shop. Upward of 30 
students can work at one time. 
Plumbing and metal-plate shops.—This shop is specially adapted for practical in- 
strvction in plumbing and metal-plate work. All tools, appliances, and materials 
required for elementary and advanced instruction are provided by the school. There 
is accommodation for about 40 students to work at one time. The same shop is used 
on alternate nights for metal-plate work, the student in this subject being equally 
well provided for, and every convenience is arranged for a complete practical study 
of the subject, all tools and materials being found by the school. 
Carpenters’ and pattern-makers’ shop.—A large shop 75 feet long and 20 feet wide 
has been fitted up for giving practical instruction to carpenters and pattern-makers 
on alternate nights. 
Machine drawing room.—The machine drawing room has been specially fitted with 
a view to giving every facility to students to acquire a complete knowledge of 
mechanical drawing. Drawing boards, T-squares, and set squares will be provided 
by the school, the student being required to find his own drawing pins, instru- 
ments, and paper. In order to enable each person to keep his board, utensils, etc., 
clean and free from the interference of others, a locker is provided, the key of which 
is held by the student forthe session on the payment of 6 pence, which is returned at 
the end of the course on delivery of the key and drawing utensils in good order. 
Geometry room.—The geometry room is fitted with lockers similar to the machine 
drawing room, and the same materials are provided for students’ use on the same 
conditions.

    120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
SHEFFIELD, 
Sheffield is in the northern part of England, county of York; population (1891), 
324,243. Enrollment in elementary schools (1892), 61,122 (board schools, 34,814; 
voluntary, 26,308). Average attendance, 51,697 (board schools, 30,042; voluntary 
schools, 21,655). : 
The great center of iron and steel manufactures, Sheffield, has natu- 
rally a deep interest in technical instruction. The school board, fully 
alive to local demands, has been active in fostering science teaching, 
drawing, and manual training in the elementary schools. The Central 
Higher-Grade School is maintained as a free school, and admission open 
to all pupils who have passed the sixth grade in the three elementary 
branches. The scheme of instruction embraces a course in the essen- 
tial branches of a general education, including foreign languages, with 
the opportunity for specialization in the higher classes. Those who are 
intended for the teaching profession or kindred work have facilities 
for preparation in all the subjects covered by the examinations they 
have in view; those who desire to enter, afterwards, the workshop or 
laboratory devote themselves more particularly to the sciences bearing 
upon Sheffield industries and to manual occupations; while those who 
aim at commercial pursuits give particular attention to German, short- 
hand, and bookkeeping. 
In the evening classes large provision is made for science and tech- 
nical subjects. 
The needs of pupils who can not hope to pursue their studies beyond 
the elementary grades are not overlooked. They gain a certain famil- 
iarity with scientific subjects by means of lectures or experimental 
lessons in mechanics and domestic economy given by science demon- 
strators, once a fortnight, at nearly all the board schools. 
The Sheffield Technical School, in connection with Firth College, is 
intended to provide thorough training in the sciences applicable to 
local industries. The work of the school is carried on in three sections: 
(1) the junior day department; (2) the senior day department, special- 
ized into (a) the engineering section, and (b) the metallurgical section; 
(3) evening classes for general and technical instruction. 
Courses of instruction.—The course in the-junior day department 
includes arithmetic, algebra, Euclid, mechanics, heat, theoretical and 
practical chemistry, physiography, freehand, model, geometrical and 
mechanical drawing, use of tools in workshops, French, German, and 
shorthand. 
The fees are 10 shillings per month of actual school work, payable in 
advance monthly. 
The senior day department provides advanced courses of instruction 
for students who intend to specialize their studies in either of the fol- 
lowing branches: 
(a) Mechanical, mining, or electrical engineering. 
(0) The metallurgy of iron and steel.
-P-A-G-E-149
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 121 
To students entering for the complete engineering or metallurgical 
course, a composition fee, making a reduction of about 20 per cent of 
the full fee, is made. 
Students may join any one of the classes without entering for the 
whole course; they may also enter for instruction ‘or research in any 
special branch of engineering or metallurgy other than that arranged 
for in the complete courses. 
The aim of the committee is to provide courses of instruction for 
evening students which shall be as complete as possible, considering 
the time at disposal, and it is arranged that all the advantages of the 
institution in every department shall be extended to evening students 
who attend the classes regularly and continue their studies for a suffi- 
ciently long period to complete the course of study laid down. 
The fees for the evening classes are 5 shillings for the session for one 
course of lectures, and 2s. 6d. for each additional course of lectures. 
A fee of 10 shillings admits to any or all the lectures. Special fees are 
charged for laboratory courses. 
LIVERPOOL, 
Liverpool is in the northwestern part of England, situated on the river Mersey, 
county of Lancaster. Population (1891), 517,951. 
Prior to the passage of the technical instruction act, Liverpool had 
made extended provision for scientific and technical instruction. A 
report on the subject issued in 1890 contains the following statement 
as to resources for the work: 
In.the valuable series of educational institutions controlled by the city council are 
included a museum which, for completeness and scientific arrangement, is probably 
unequalled anywhere else in the provinces, and a gallery of art bearing a striking 
testimony to the enlightened interest long taken in this subject by the municipality ; 
while, in that newer institution (University College) which has recently brought 
university culture within the reach of the general body of its residents, the interest 
felt by leading citizens of Liverpool in technological subjects has resulted in the 
erection of chemical and engineering laboratories fitted with all the most modern 
appliances. It is, however, not merely by these facilities for the higher forms of 
scientific and technical study that Liverpool has made liberal provision for the pro- 
motion and encouragement of that branch of knowledge. 
Some thirty years ago a “town’s meeting” held in the town hall, under the presi- 
dency of the mayor for the time being, founded the “Liverpool School of Science 
and Technology”; and the impetus since given to the study of science and art, by 
the classes established in connection with this school, by the “Liverpool science 
and art classes,” and by similar classes more recently introduced by other bodies, 
has been so great that only in one or two localities, which exceptional industrial 
circumstances render specially favorable to such study, do the successful students 
under the science and art department exceed those of Liverpool in number. In 
connection, also, with the elementary schools of this city a system of science 
instruction has been in operation for some years, which was mentioned with 
approval in the report of the recent royal commission on technical instructions 
and referred to as the model they would recommend for general adoption in schools 
of this class. Moreover, when some two or three years ago a national association 
was founded for the promotion of technical instruction, Liverpool was one of the 
earliest towns to establish a local association affiliated with that central body.

  122 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Such was the position at the end of August, 1889, when the technical 
instruction act was passed. 
Immediately after the passage of the law the school board and the 
managers of voluntary schools united in an effort to promote its appli- 
cation to elementary schools. 
A report submitted by a subcommittee of this conference gives the 
following summary of the provision for technical instruction at the 
time (1890): 
In addition to the work carried on in public elementary day schools, instruction 
of the kind contemplated by the technical instruction act was given by some seven- 
teen separate institutions, including about 5,500 individual students. Of these stu- 
dents not quite 2,000 were day scholars, the remainder attending exclusively in the 
evening. 
* * * * * * * 
  Eight of the institutions had classes connected with the science and art depart- 
ment, giving instruction in science to 310 day and 2,031 evening students, and in 
art to 1,004 day and 965 evening students. Four other institutions, whose classes 
were soon to be connected with South Kensington, gave instruction in science to 319 
day and 145 evening students, and in art to 188 day and 36 evening students. 
These figures yield a total of 629 day and 2,176 evening (in all 2,805) students of 
science, and of 1,192 day and 1,001 evening (in all 2,193) students of art, represent- 
ing probably less than 4,000 individuals out of a total population exceeding 600,000. 
As (without referring to those over 21 years of age) about 75,000 of this population 
are young persons between 14 and 21 years of age, it is clear that there is still ample 
room for a very considerable increase in the number of science and art students. 
* * * * * * 
In addition to the work carried on by the institutions included in these returns, 
evening classes for artisans have been held for the past two or three years in the 
engineering laboratories of the Liverpool University College, and also Saturday 
morning classes in wood-working for teachers in public elementary schools. 
* * * * * * * 
In connection, however, with the day classes of its physical, chemical, and engi- 
neering departments, University College has made almost the only provision which 
exists in Liverpool for the higher forms of technical instruction. The two latter 
departments already possess lecture rooms, laboratories, appliances, and apparatus 
of the highest order, and it is intended, as soon as possible, to provide similar advan- 
tages for the physical department. The number of students under training is already 
considerable; but technical instruction proper can not be given without a compara- 
tively small addition to the existing staff of teachers. 
* * * * * * * 
In all the board, and in a large number of the voluntary, schools, kindergarten 
instruction for infants has been in operation for many years, and in moss of these 
schools drawing has been systematically taught to all the boys. In all the board, 
and in several of the voluntary, schools, the system of science instruction, to which 
reference has been made previously, has been in operation for nearly fifteen years. 
At the present time some 2,500 boys and 1,500 girls are receiving instruction in this 
way in the specific subjects, “mechanics” and ‘‘domestic economy,” respectively, 
under the education department, while in nearly a dozen of these schools classes, 
embracing in the aggregate some 400 scholars, have, during the past year, been 
established in connection with the science and art department for those boys who 
have passed the sixth standard. Provision, also, has for several years been made in 
connection with a considerable number of schools for the introduction of practical 
cookery, and from 1,500 to 2,000 girls are now receiving instruction in this subject.
-P-A-G-E-151
  TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 123 
Under the auspices of the Liverpool Association for the Promotion of Technical 
Instruction, classes in fretwork and wood carving have been carried on in connec- 
tion with some ten elementary schools and were attended with very encouraging re- 
sults. The number of scholars taught was limited to fifty in each school, but that 
number might, in most cases, have been considerably exceeded. As the instruction 
was given entirely out of school hours, the eagerness of the boys to attend these 
classes affords a strong indication of the attraction which manual instruction has for 
boys in elementary schools. 
The school board and conference of school managers express the 
opinion that any general scheme of technical instruction for this city 
should embrace: 
(a) Elementary schools proper; 
(b) Continuation schools or classes, both day and evening, including organized 
science schools; 
(c) Science and art and technological classes ; 
(d) Commercial classes ; 
(e) Special technical classes, either day or evening, to meet the particular require- 
ments of individual industries; 
(f) The science and engineering departments of Liverpool University College; 
and, possibly, 
(g) A technical and commercial museum relating to the trade of the town and port. 
The importance of laying a firm foundation for technical instruction 
in the elementary schools is emphasized by the following resolutions: 
(a) The general introduction in elementary schools of manual and science instrue- 
tion for boys in Standard V and upwards; : 
(b) The retention of scholars as long as possible in public elementary schools, and 
the adoption of a special curriculum, including subjects in connection with the 
science and art department for children in Standard VII and upwards; 
“(e) The provision made by the school board for manual and science instruction in 
connection with its own schools, being, as far as legally possible, rendered available 
for voluntary schools also; and 
(d) The city council being requested to exercise their power under the technical 
instruction act, 1889, in aid of technical instruction, if, and when, given in 
elementary schools. 
MANCHESTER. 
Manchester is in the northern part of England, Lancaster County. Population 
(1891), 
Provision for technical instruction is a matter of deep interest to 
Manchester, and the school board has endeavored to include in the 
course of elementary schools the subjects, i.e., drawing and elementary 
science, which are the necessary preliminary to advanced technical 
courses. : 
Experiments in classes for tool work, in connection.with the day 
schools, were made as early as 1882. The board has long maintained 
higher-grade schools in which the more advanced pupils from the lower 
grades are gathered for the continuance of their studies under favor- 
able conditions. Advanced evening schools have also been maintained. 
The Central Higher-Grade School has been particularly noted for its 
success in science teaching, and many of its pupils have obtained 
scholarships admitting them to higher institutions. 
     
-P-A-G-E-152
  124 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The efforts of the board in these directions have been stimulated by 
the influence of Owens College and of the Mather and Platt?’s School, 
which is, perhaps, the most celebrated workshop school in England. 
The Manchester Grammar School, an endowed school dating from the 
reign of Henry VIII, has also conduced to the same end, having been 
one of the first of ‘the secondary schools to introduce laboratory 
instruction, These various efforts to meet new demands in education 
culminated in 1883 in the Manchester Technical School. This was 
developed from the Mechanics’ Institute, which had made technical _ 
classes a feature of its work. Liberal donations from the legatees of © 
Sir Joseph Whitworth subsequently increased the resources of the 
school, and finally, in 1890, the proposition was made to incorporate the 
school with the Whitworth Institute. The acceptance of this prop- 
osition has secured to the school a fine site, while its resources have 
been further enriched by money grants from the same estate and from 
. the Manchester corporation. 
A building is in process of erection and plans are being formed for 
the development of a school of high order. As a preliminary measure, 
two committees of investigation were sent to visit and report upon 
technical schools and instruction on the continent. 
The able secretary of the Manchester school, Mr. J. H. Repaclee 
furnished an account of the new building and the proposed plans of 
the school for the Record of November, 1892, from which the following 
particulars are taken: 
The site for the school comprises upwards of 5,800 square yards net of building 
land, exceedingly convenient in respect of accessibility, shape, and light. The 
whole of the site will be covered, and it is intended to find accommodation in the 
new building for the work now carried on in the institution in Princess street, and 
in the branch schools in Peter street and Whitworth street, which include provision 
for mechanical, electrical, civil, and sanitary engineering; the chemical industries; 
spinning and weaving; the building trades; letterpress and lithographic printing, 
and other minor industries; industrial art and design; and commercial and domes- 
tic economy subjects. 
The magnitude of the building elicited an important competition, no less than 
twenty-six sets of plans being submitted to the judgment of Mr. Alfred Water- 
house, R. A., who, in consultation with the technical instruction committee, awarded 
the first premium to Messrs. Spalding and Cross, of London. 
The style of the building is renaissance of the early French period, and the treat- 
ment is such as to give a large amount of light. The material to be used for the 
front elevations will be red Ruabon bri relieved with terra cotta, which, it is 
expected, will best resist the unfavorable influences of the Manchester atmosphere. 
The building will be roofed with green Whitland Abbey slates, and the floors will 
be fireproof throughout and covered with wood blocks, except whore impervious 
paving is required, as in the dyehouse and laboratories. 
The ventilation will be arranged on the plenum or push principle, similar to that 
adopted in the chemical laboratories at Zurich. 
The building comprises six floors, none of the rooms being less than 15 feet of clear 
internal height, and averaging 25 feet to 31 feet in depth. The general scheme 
embraces class, lecture, drawing, and designing rooms, laboratories, workshops, 
library, administrative and other offices, students’ and lecturers’ rooms, ete., all 
lighted from the face of the building, with wide continuous corridors all round each 
     
   
-P-A-G-E-153
  
  TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 125 
floor, lit from the internal area, thus giving convenient access to the rooms, each 
department being kept, as far as possible, distinct and self-contained. It is intended 
to make these corridors a continual source of interest and instruction to the students 
by placing therein small exhibits, pictures, and diagrams bearing upon the subjects 
taught. 
The total available floor space exceeds 150,000 square feet, exclusive of corridors, 
The central space of the building between the large internal areas, and lit from 
them, is oceupied by a block containing, on the ground floor, the main entrance hall, 
83 feet by 50 feet, which will be utilized as an industrial museum at all times acces- 
sible, and through which the main double staircase, extending to the top of the 
building, is reached; on the first fioor, a public lecture hall, 30 feet high, of similar 
area, to be devoted especially to brief courses of lectures by recognized authorities 
and specialists on the technology of the commerce and manufactures of the city and 
Cistrict, and to other lectures calculated to educate the public taste; above which, 
on the third floor, there will be placed a chemical laboratory for 80 students. Two 
additional independent staircases are provided, as well as a spacious passenger lift, 
and, though only one entrance will give access to the building for students, officials, 
and the public, suitable exits in case of alarm are provided. 
The basement, which is sunk only 7 feet in the ground and is exceedingly well 
lighted, is devoted to the department requiring heavy machinery and other appli- 
ances needful to industrial operations on a considerable scale. 
Here are placed the electrical engineering workshops and testing tables, dynamo 
house, electro-chemical and technical testing laboratories, secondary battery room, 
rooms for optical, photo-metric, magneto-metric, and spectroscopic operations, the 
mechanical engineering workshops and testing laboratory, with its experimental 
steam engine and large and small testing machines, the spinning and weaving rooms 
for cotton, silk, and other fibers; bleaching, dyeing, printing, and finishing rooms; 
plumbers’, bricklayers’, and masons’ workshops; shop “‘r repairs and construction 
of new appliances; wood-working machinery. 
The whole of the main driving will be by means of the electric current from the 
corporation central station, which will also supply current by independent leads 
for the 2,000 incandescent lamps required for lighting the building. 
The remaining stories will be occupied by laboratories, general and special, 
numerous class, lecture, drawing, and designing rooms, a large gymnasium, con- 
venient rooms for the accommodation of scientific societies, and other means for 
developing the corporate life of the school. 
The following is the space allotted on the various floors for the respective depart- 
ments:

The estimated cost of the building, including fittings and the provision of appli- 
ances and machinery, is about £125,000, toward which the committee have availa- 
ble £14,000, balance of profit from the Royal Jubilee Exhibition; £5,000 promised by 
the Whitworth legatees; and the property in Princess street and Peter street, valued
-P-A-G-E-154
  
  126 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
at £31,000. The remainder of the sum required will be borrowed for a period of 
thirty years on the security of the 1d. rate. 
As its name implies, the school is now a municipal institution, governed by a com- 
mittee consisting of 36 members, 24 of whom are members of the city council, and 
12 are chosen from the general public interested in the progress of commerce and 
manufactures. The new school may be looked upon as amongst the first fruits of the 
technical instruction act of 1889, and of the local taxation (custom and excise) 
act of 1890, which placed so large a sum at the command of local authorities for the 
purpose of technical instruction. 
It will be the aim of the authorities of the school to provide a practical scientific 
training of the highest kind in the chief industries of the district, so as to make it 
unnecessary for its youth to take advantage of foreign technical schools, leaving to 
the school board and other institutions the duty of providing for the subjects of a 
general education. Certainly no effort or expense will be spared to make the school 
efficient, alike in respect of its staff of lecturers and in the provision of the best 
appliances. The numerous technical schools which are springing up so rapidly in 
the smaller towns in southeast Lancashire will, it is to be hoped, create a liberal 
supply of students, able to take advantage of the splendid opportunities the new 
municipal technical school will offer for advanced instruction in the science and 
practice of its commerce and industries. 
LEEDS. 
Leeds is in the northwestern part of England, county of York, on the river Aire. 
Population (1891), 367,506; enrollment in elementary schools (1891), 69,432; (board 
schools, 45,844; voluntary, 23,173; board industrial schools, 415). 
Yorkshire College, Leeds, affords provision for higher technical train- 
ing; it includes an engineering school, chemical laboratory, and physi- 
cal departments, an excellent dyeing school, and a weaving school. 
The Leeds Mechanics’ Institution and Literary Society maintains art 
schools, a science school, and a school for theoretical instruction in 
mathematics, botany, iron and steel manufacture, mechanics, engineer- 
ing, steam, physics, ete. Languages and shorthand are also taught. 
The school board for Leeds has shown a progressive and liberal spirit 
in respect to education. It has been active in urging the Government 
to do away with the policy of payments on the results of individual 
examinations, a policy abandoned in 1890. Its influence has been 
exerted in favor of the billraising the age for the half-time employment 
of children to 11 years;! and it was one of the first school boards to 
take advantage of the free school act. Almost immediately after the 
passage of the act the board declared all of its schools free, excepting 
the higher grade school, in which the fee was reduced by the full 
amount of the fee grant, i.e., 10 shillings per capita yearly. The even- 
ing schools were also allowed the benefits of the act; all scholars who 
attend every session of a term having the whole of their fees returned, 
and others whose attendance is regular having a large portion returned. 
Provision has also been maintained in the schools for the subjects for 
which grants are made by the science and art department. In 1891 
the amount secured from this source was about $9,000. 
    
The bill has just peed aan takes tte: ranniey fs 1894,

   TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 127 
Immediately upon the allotment of the surplus from the liquor duties 
to the county councils, the Leeds board took steps to secure funds (1) 
for the development of manual and technical instruction in day and 
night schools, and (2) for scholarships to enable promising pupils to 
continue their education in higher technical schools. The Leeds coun- 
cil accorded $15,000 for this purpose. 
The Central Higher-Grade School for boys and girls was installed in a 
fine new building in 1889; here ample provision has been made for 
scientific and technical instruction suited to the grade. Accommoda- 
tion is provided for about 2,500 pupils, and at the end of the second 
year (1891) the actual enrollment was 2,157. 
The school prospectus sets forth the aim of the board as follows: 
On a basis of elementary education, it is intended to superadd a system of higher 
education, which, at a moderate charge will train pupils for industrial, manufac- 
turing and professional pursuits. This system of instruction will have its begin- 
nings in the elementary school, but will be practically carried out in a three years’ 
course beyond the standards (i. e., seven elementary years), 
It will embrace such courses as— 
I. The classical (or professional), in which Latin, mathematics, uence: and draw- 
ing form the chief subjects. 
II. The modern (or mercantile), in which French or German, commercial geogra- 
phy, mathematics, science, and drawing will receive most attention. 
Ill. The scientific (or technical), in which mathematics, science, and drawing 
form the leading subjects. 
Each course will in addition contain all the subjects of a sound general education 
in English. It is intended that pupils who have attended the full course shall be 
prepared for the matriculation examination of the London University, and the pre- 
liminary examination for arts, law, and medicine of the Yorkshire College, Victoria 
University ; as well as for the preliminary examinations of the Law Society, Phar- 
maceutical Society, veterinary colleges, and for the Oxford and Cambridge senior 
local examinations. The work of the higher section will be found to embrace all 
the subjects for thoroughly preparing those who desire to become pupil teachers at 
the end of the first or second years’ apprenticeship; and such a preparatory course, 
giving instruction in languages, science, and art, as well as in Knglish subjects, 
should enable such students to pass well the pupil-teachers’ examinations, and to 
take an honorable position in the examinations for admission to training colleges. 
Classes of boys and girls have already been formed for these examinations, and the 
text books used in the various courses are selected from those prescribed for such 
work. 
It is the board’s earnest wish that no promising child in the borough should be 
debarred from having a chance of securing a place in the higher-grade school, and 
therefore, 60 free scholarships, tenable for three years, making 180 in all, are open 
to competition each year to children of the public elementary schools of the bor- - 
ough, as an encouragement to continue the education of promising boysand girls,who 
might otherwise, from the circumstances of their parents, be removed from school. 
These free scholarships admit suecessful competitors to all the classes of the school, 
and text-books are provided for them free of charge. 
The services of teachers having special qualifications have been secured for the 
school, and the teaching staff generally made as efficient as possible. With the 
school fees and Government grants, the working of the school will involve no cost 
to the rate payers. During the last financial year the school brought a “credit” to 
the rates on school maintenance account, amounting to £154 5s, 9d., in addition to 
having provided free scholarships worth £2 each to 180 children.

The opening of the higher grade school has also, the board are pleased to observe, 
given an impetus to higher education in other public elementary schools in the 
borough, both board and volantary. At Bewerley street, the board have felt it 
incumbent upon them to make supplementary provision for the south side of the 
river. A well-appointed laboratory, with 40 working benches, is provided, in order 
to make the study of chemistry practical as well as theoretical. There is an excel- 
lent workshop for manual instruction, containing benches for 60 students. The 
board have also in course of erection at Bewerley street, an assembly hall and 
school gymnasium, which they hope will be available for general use. The Bewer- 
ley street school will shortly be equipped with the necessary appliances for imstruc- 
tion in chemistry, practical geometry, machine construction and drawing, math- 
ematics, etc., in accordance with the syllabus of the science and art department, 
and by means of the special accommodation now afforded, large advantages are 
expected to accrue to this important school, which has already 1,531 scholars on the 
rolls. 
The report for 1888-1891 gives the following account of the new build- 
ing of the Central Higher-Grade School: 
The utmost attention has been bestowed on the lighting, warming, ventilation, 
and sanitary arrangements of the building. The fittings are of the most approved 
designs calculated to insure the comfort of the pupils and to secure the best 
educational methods. The chemical laboratory is one of the largest and 
equipped in the Kingdom. The physical laboratory is fitted and furnished for 
enabling pupils practically to perform what the demonstrator has shown in the 
lecture theater. Commodious playgrounds are provided for recreation; and pupils 
coming from a distance can have their luncheons, warm if desired, in comfortable 
dining rooms.'! The highest testimony as to the suitability of the buildings and the 
efficiency of the fittings was supplied by one who, from position and opportunities, 
may be regarded as the greatest English expert on school buildings and appliances, 
E. R. Robson, F. 8. A., the consulting architect of the education department, to 
whom all the plans of schools in Britain have to be submitted for approval. As he 
has visited professionally the best European and American schools, special impor- 
tance should be attached to his opinion: ‘(I think.this is the best and most com- 
pletely organized I have seen.” 
Sir Lyon Playfair, K. C. B., M. P., formerly vice-president of the committee of 
council on education, on a visit to the school last year, pronounced it “ the finest and 
best equipped school in this or in any country ”—a testimony of the highest value 
from one who has visited the principal schools in Europe and America. On the 
occasion of the visit of the British Association to Leeds in September, 1890, the 
school was visited by many of the most eminent scientific and educational authori- 
ties, and it is a matter of gratification to know that the visitors were unanimous in 
lauding the school and its equipments. Sir Henry Roscoe, M. P., d: “T think 
that this is the best school I have yet seen in the Kingdom;” while Sir Philip Mag- 
nus expressed himself as ‘highly delighted with the structure and organization of 
the school; I have seen nothing better.” 
The gymnasium has been fitted with a great variety of apparatus, affording every 
gradation of exercise for young people of both sexes; and the greatest care is taken 
to prevent overstrain or accident, all the exe s being conductéd under the per- 
sonal supervision of a thoroughly qualified instructor and in the presence and with 
the assistance of the teacher of the class. The board, anxious to avail themselves 
of every opportunity for benefitting the scholars, have taken advantage of the recent 
circular on manual instruction issued by the science and art department, and have 
erected and equipped a commodious workshop, in which the training of hand and

eye will lead to that union so much to be desired in all industrial oceupations—the 
union of drawing and practical handiwork. 
The interest displayed by every boy in this practical workmanship will lead to 
that accurate perception of form and correct execution of hand which all manual 
and technical occupations require. It is the aim of the board to carry on in this 
school under the most healthful conditions the education of children to the fullest 
extent from elementary to secondary subjects, and yet without undue pressure. In 
order to give a practical training also to girls, cookery and needlework have always 
received attention in the elementary section; and arrangements have recently been 
made to secure efficient instruction for the pupils of the higher section in cookery 
and in the cutting-out of garments. 
BRADFORD. 
Bradford is in the northwestern, part of England, County of York. Population 
(1891), 216,361. Enrollment in board schools, 23,305; average attendance, 19,981; 
(voluntary schools, no data). 
THE BRADFORD TECHNICAL COLLEGE. 
Bradford is the seat of a technical college which is the pioneer institu- 
tion of its class in England. It was organized about fourteen years 
ago, and in 1880 was installed in a building built and equipped for its 
work at an expense of about $200,000. The institution comprises a 
day school, an art department, chemistry and dyeing department, tex- 
tile department, engineering department, and evening science classes. 
The day school is intended to prepare youths for industrial, manu- 
facturing, and commercial pursuits, and for the examinations prelimi- 
nary to professional studies. Boys are admitted at 12 years of age 
if they have passed the sixth grade of the elementary schools, or upon 
examination. The course combines modern languages, Latin, science, 
mathematics, and drawing, with technical instruction. The last named 
includes designing, weaving, manufacture of cloth, dyeing, engineer- 
ing and metal work, building, woodwork, advanced drawing, modeling, 
and bookkeeping. 
The attendance in 1890 was 261 students. The fees in the day 
schoolsrange from £1 5s. to £4 4s.aterm, or £3 15s. to £12 12s, perannum. 
The school earns a large proportion of the grant from the science and 
art department on the results of examination, receiving in 1890 
£1,156 16s. out of a total of £1,500 in the entire institution. 
The art department, which is open to both men and women, is 
intended for students who contemplate art as a career, and also for 
designers, modelers, and art teachers. Three distinct courses are 
offered, i. e., a course of general art study; drawing and designing for 
textile students; architectural drawing. Instruction is given in both 
day and evening classes. The courses of the technical departments 
are conducted with special reference to the industries of which Brad- 
ford is a leading center, i. e., woolen manufactures and transportation. 
The total number of students in 1890 was 1,100, of whom 400 were 
enrolled in the day classes.

  The inclusive fee for all day classes in the general art course is 
£111s.6d. a term; in the architectural £5; in the: day classes of the 
textile department £2 10s. g 
In 1892 the Bradford County council created 90 day scholarships, 
and 60 evening scholarships, each tenable in this school for two years, 
and open to competition. Previous to this action between 80 and 100 
scholarships were available in the different departments. 
SCOTLAND. 
The movement for technical instruction has not advanced so rapidly 
in Scotland asin England. In the northern division, Glasgow and 
Dundee are the chief centers of activity in this respect. The former 
is the seat of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College, 
organized in 1886 by the union of several existing institutions. The 
Dundee and District Association has for its purpose the promotion 
of technical and commercial education in accordance with the recent 
laws. A great variety of classes, art, science, and technical, have been 
established under its auspices. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
The agricultural interests of the country have not been overlooked 
in the recent efforts to provide for the training of the industrial classes. 
The demand for graded and systematic instruction in the sciences 
applicable to agriculture as well asin its processes is widespréad. At 
the same time the very nature of the districts in which this instruction 
is needed makes it difficult to meet the needs by local action. Prior to 
1888 the work had been left wholly to private initiative, save that the 
principles of agriculture were recognized among the extra subjects for 
which grants might be allowed in elementary schools. In 1888 the 
proposition for an annual appropriation for agricultural education 
was passed, the same to be distributed by the board of agriculture. 
The fund distributed has increased each year, being £2,930 in 1888-89 ; 
the following year £4,588, and rising to £6,705in 1890-91. Seventeen 
institutions in England and Wales, and 14 in Scotland, have shared in 
the grant. Of the former 8 and of the latter 7 are agricultural, 
including dairy associations. Theremainder are distinctly educational. 
In their application of the funds recently placed at their disposal the 
county councils are doing much to foster this particular interest. 
University College of North Wales (Bangor), which was feunded in 
1883, and receives an annual grant of £4,000, has made extensive pro- 
visions for this subject. 
The scheme of work at this institution includes “the establishment 
of three dairy schools at Welshpool, Denbigh, and Bangor; the delivery 
of ‘extension’ lectures on agricultural subjects over six northern coun- 
ties of Wales ; the conduct of field experiments ; the establishment of 
classes for schoolmasters in agricultural subjects; and of a complete col-
-P-A-G-E-159
  
  TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 131 
lege course of instruction for agricultural students;” all of which has 
been inaugurated. The parliamentary report on the distribution of the 
grants for agricultural schools says of this work: 
The college possesses exceptional advantages for carrying on the work it has 
undertaken in this connection, for it is situated in one of the most thickly popu- 
lated agricultural districts in North Wales. Facilities are also claimed on its behalf 
for dealing with the bilingual difficulty, which is one of the great obstacles to the 
spread of agricultural education in the principality, while the governing body of 
the college is thoroughly representative of every district in North Wales. 
It has heen shown that a most complete system of agricultural education can be 
organized by this college; one which will not only fulfill its own proper duties in 
the six northern counties of Wales, but forms a type on the lines of which it may 
be feasible to organize systematic agricultural education throughout the kingdom. 
Citations from second report of the royal commission on technical instruction appointed 
1881, report issued 1884. 
It will have been seen from the preceding pages of this report that we have attached 
considerable relative importance to that portion of our commission which directed us 
to inquire into the condition of industry in foreign countries; and it is our duty to 
state that, although the display of continental manufactures at the Paris Interna- 
tional Exhibition in 1878 had led us to expect great progress, we were not prepared 
for so remarkable a development of their natural resources, nor for such perfection 
in their industrial establishments, as we actually found in France, in Germany, in 
Belgium, and in Switzerland. Much machinery of all kinds is now produced abroad, 
equal in finish and in efficiency to that of this country, and we found it in numerous 
instances applied to manufactures with as great skill and intelligence as with us. 
In some branches of industry, “more especially in those requiring an intimate 
acquaintance with organic chemistry—as, for instance, in the preparation of artificial 
colors from coal tar—Germany has unquestionably taken the lead. 
* * * * * * * 
It may not be improper to mention here that, in whatever degreo the technical 
instruction of our continental rivals may have trained them for competition with 
ourselves, in their own, in neutral, and to some extent in our own home markets, 
much of their success is due to more painstaking, more pliancy, and greater thrift; 
and also to the general cultivation, the knowledge of modern languages, and of eco- 
nomic geography usually possessed by continental manufacturers. 
* * * * * * * 
In art manufactures proper, notably in porcelain, earthenware, and glass, as also 
in decorative furniture, our productions are of conspicuous excellence. It is possible 
that this may be due in a certain degree to the employment in some branches of 
skilled workers trained in foreign countries, and we can not do otherwiso than 
acknowledge the preeminence in the main of our French neighbors in design as 
applied to decorative work, or disregard the efforts which they are making to main- 
tain that preeminence and those made in Belgium and Italy to emulate them. 
After reference to the superior industrial organization of Great 
Britain in the first quarter of this century, to the fact that her factories 
were then the chief industrial schools of the world, and the source of 
the impulse which led France, Germany, and Switzerland to create 
schools of technology, the commissioners add: 
Technical high schools now exist in nearly every continental state, and are the 
recognized channel for the instruction of those who are intended to become the 
technical directors of industrial establishments. Many of the technical chemists 
have, however, been and are being trained in the German universities. Your com-
-P-A-G-E-160
132 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
missioners believe that the success which has attended the foundation of extensive 
manufacturing establishments, engineering shops, and other works on the continent, 
could not have been achieved to its full extent in the face of many retarding 
influences had it not been for the system of high technical instruction in these 
schools, for the facilities for carrying on original scientific investigation, and for the 
general appreciation of the value of that instruction and of original research which 
is felt in those countries. 
* * * * * * * 
Your commissioners can not repeat too often that they have been impressed with 
the general intelligence and technical knowledge of the masters and managers of 
industrial establishments on the continent. They have found that these persons, as 
a rule, possess a sound knowledge of the sciences upon which their industry 
depends. They are familiar with every new scientific discovery of importance, and 
appreciate its applicability to their special industry. They adopt not only the 
inventions and improvements made in their own country, but also those of the world 
at large, thanks to their knowledge of foreign languages and of the conditions of 
manufacture prevalent elsewhere. 
se * * * * * * 
  The commissioners assert, furthermore, the inferiority of Great Britain to conti- 
nental countries with respect to the number of efficient secondary schools. The 
best preparation for technical study they observe “is a good modern secondary 
school of the types of the Manchester grammar school, the Bedford modern school, 
and the Allan Glen’s institution at Glasgow.” Unfortunately, our middle classes 
are at a great disadvantage, compared with those of the continent, for want of a 
sufficient number of such schools. The transfer of the functions of the endowed 
schools commissioners to the charity commissioners has not had the effect of 
increasing the rate of progress in the reorganization of our secondary schools. We 
consider it to be essential that steps should be taken to insure that this work shall 
be carried on with greater vigor in the future than it has been hitherto. 
They dwell also upon the lack of science instruction in the ele- 
mentary schools, and the need of drawing as an universal branch of 
instruction. With reference to this subject they say: 
We can not too often call attention to the extraordinary efforts which are being 
made abroad for instruction in art, more especially as applied to industrial and dec- 
orative purposes, and to the important influence of this instruction in furnishing 
employment for artisans on the continent. Without depreciating what has been 
done in this direction by the schools and classes under the auspices of the science 
and art department in this country, and whilst fully alive to the importance of 
the organization which tends to the diffusion of art instruction over a wide area, 
your commissioners can not conceal from themselves the fact that their influence 
on industrial art in this country is far from being so great as that of similar schools 
abroad. This is due, no doubt, to some extent to the want of proper and sufficient 
preparation on the part of the students, owing to the inadequate instruction they 
have received in drawing in the elementary schools. 
Citations from the report of a technical instruction committee appointed in 1891 by the 
council of the city of Manchester to visit and report on certain institutions and schools 
of the Continent ‘devoted mainly to technical and scientific instruction as applied to 
industry.” 
Your deputation was much impressed by the position given to technical education 
all over the Continent. It is not a subsidiary portion of educational work, nor yet 
an exotic, but is all-pervading, and is as much a part of the life of the people as is 
elementary education. As a matter of fact, itis an integral part of the educational 
system of the Continent, and being so, the lower schools are arranged to minister to
-P-A-G-E-161
  TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 133 
the technical schools and to send up a supply of prepared students. It is difficult 
to overestimate the value of this grading process in regard to education, securing 
as it does economy of work on the one hand and thoroughness of work on the other. 
If we take the rough division sometimes used, and speak of the modern or scientific 
side of education in contradistinction to the classical, then it must be acknowledged 
that the former has achieved a position of importance abroad not yet allowed it 
here, with the further result that provision is made at an early stage for specializing 
study with a view to future occupation and the kind of life a youth is destined for. 
Accepting the definition of the act of 1889, that ‘technical instruction shall mean 
instruction in the principles of science and art applicable to industries, and in the 
application of special branches of science and art to specific industries or employ- 
ments,” it may be said that such instruction is seriously regarded abroad, and is 
practically carried out on a scale implying a settled belief in its value and impor- 
tance. 
It may be of advantage to briefly summarize the general impressions left upon our 
minds by the visits we made. 2 
Chemistry and physics.—The preeminence of continental schools in these subjects 
is admitted, and we only desire to express our sense of the extent and thoroughness 
of the teaching and of the costly character of the equipment. 
Drawing.—Exceptional prominence is given to this subject, and the teaching of 
it is subdivided and specialized to a remarkable degree, it being hardly too much 
to say that, as the three R’s are to general education, drawing is esteemed to be to 
all branches of technical knowledge. 
Museums and libraries.—The provision of museums and libraries for educational 
work in schools is almost universal. Even at an ordinary primary school in Zurich 
wo saw a museum of natural history, and other specimens, for use in teaching, of 
quite a superior kind; and soin the higher schools, where the libraries more espe- 
cially are good; scientific books and periodicals, and also specifications of patents 
of all nations, as well as collections of fabrics, being amply supplied and commodi- 
ously disposed for the use of students. 
Industrial technical schools. Weaving.—It is interesting to note that nearly all the 
schools of this class were begun by private enterprise. At Chemnitz, at Mulhausen, 
at Lyons, this was so, and the fine school at Roubaix had for its foundation schools of 
a similarly constituted kind. There can be no doubt that these schools have been 
of great value; possibly enough, the supremacy of Lyons in the silk trade may have 
been to some extent due to having such a school. 
Commercial training.—Much attention is given to the teaching of modern languages 
and to the technique of commerce. For instance, at Lyons we saw aclass at work 
in which a knowledge of languages, of the products of various countries, of the 
theory of exchange, of freights, of fiscal duties, and all the routine of a shipping 
business was being taught. The weaving and dyeing schools, too, over and above 
their use to those who are to engage in production, have a strictly commercial value, 
and may be used so as to equip the salesman and the commercial traveler. 
State and municipal aid.—It may be taken that none of the schools are self-support- 
ing. Aid is given to some by private persons, but in the main the state and the 
municipality supply the necessary means, usually in conjunction. Probably it is 
owing to the cooperation of these authorities that education is so completely system- 
atized. The municipalities of Paris and Berlin are largely engaged in educational 
work, and'so also are the Swiss communes. It is said that the educational rate of 
the canton of Zurich absorbs nearly one-third of the total expenses of the canton. 
Aim and object of technical instruction abroad.—For whom is this large provision of 
scientific knowledge as applied to industrial pursuits intended? For the ordinary 
workman? Scarcely so, as such. In France there are schools which are meant to~ 
supplant the apprenticeship system, and in Germany and Switzerland there are also 
some minor attempts to do the same thing, but the principal aim is to give instruction
-P-A-G-E-162
134 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  of a higher kind than could possibly be given all round and really to equip those who 
are to guide, direct, and by the use of special knowledge, develop industrial work.) 
It is in this direction that our deficiency lies. No one doubts the relative value of 
the English workman in comparison with the foreign one, but wherever fresh adapt- 
ations and scientific knowledge are needed, we are, and have have been, deficient. 
That an amount of technical education of an elementary kind can be given in ordi- 
nary schools to large numbers in evening classes 1s perfectly true, and such teaching 
will be of great value, but the higher and more specialized teaching must of necessity 
be restricted. It will be the duty of those in charge of such higher classes and 
schools to.see that due provision is made for, and scope given to, exceptional ability 
and exceptional application. Remission of fees and scholarships are general abroad, 
and the same means wisely used here will be the avenue by which every qualified 
person, however humble his or her circumstances, may find a ready entrance. More- 
over, special provision should be made for aiding workmen who desire to acquire 
wider knowledge of their own work than their situations afford the opportunity of 
obtaining. . 
Position in Manchester.—There is reason to be proud of the educational institu- 
tions of Manchester. In our midst are all the elements of a perfect and orderly 
system of education, from the primary school to the degree-granting university. 
The weakest link of what may one day become a chain is the technical school. Up 
to two years ago, this school was maintained by voluntary effort, and the community 
should honor the men who have done this work. The school is now inadequate to 
the demands made upon it, and its further expansion under voluntary aid is impos- 
sible. The city council, by accepting the technical instruction act, may be said to 
have contributed to render it so. Whether, apart from the application of the rates 
in aid which have effectually eut off private donations, an adequate school or tech- 
nical college could have been erected and maintained, if is hardly worth while to 
inquire; events have put it out of the question, and it is certain that considerable 
sums of money will yet be needed to adequately extend and worthily maintain the 
schocl. 
Is such a school really needed?—Our answer is, yes. Times have changed and are 
changing rapidly. Are we or are we not to prepare our people for the industrial 
struggle in which they are already launched, and which will inevitably be more 
accentuated as time goes on? Many of the towns we visited possessing institutions 
in which commercial, scientific, and industrial training is given on ascale with which 
we have nothing to really compare, have but populations of from 80,000 to 120,000— 
no more than one-fifth the number of our city; and when we think of the position 
of Manchester as the commercial capital of Lancashire, any comparison becomes 
almost ludicrous, and the efforts as yet made by us appear utterly insignificant. 
In my opinion a school or college for technical training should be founded on 
broad lines. Lancashire ministers largely to Manchester; our interests are one, and 
we shall be acting wisely if we foster the relationship and make yet another bond 
of interest. It is worthy of note that the authorities have decided to use the money 
allotted to them by the Lancashire County Council in establishing scholarships at 
the Manchester Technical School, and that two others are about to do the same. A 
school adequate to our needs should aim at fostering the smaller as well as the 
larger industries. The cotton trade has overshadowed every other in this district, 
and it may indeed have thus led, indirectly, to the neglect of other less important 
branches of business. In the north of Manchester forty years ago there was a con- 
siderable silk industry, and the important business of braid manufacturing, too, has 
languished, and follows in place of leading. Had there been a school in which the 
newest methods and the latest machinery could have been shown, efficient aid to 
these industries might have been given. These illustrations are but offered to 
enforce what your committee feel strongly, that industries trifling in size when com- 
pared with the enormous cotton industry do yet in the aggregate employ a large 
number of persons, and it will be found that the prosperity of this, and indeed of
-P-A-G-E-163
    TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 135 
any large urban community, is stable in proportion to the variety of occupations 
and industries carried on. It may fairly be argued that a good technical school 
would probably result in attracting certain industries to the district. If, for 
instance, electrical engineering were well and adequately taught, firms engaged in 
the making of electrical appliances would find it to their advantage to locate them- 
selves here. 
Classes for women.—With the exception of Paris, the recognition of the need of 
industrial training for women does not appear to be much more general and 
advanced abroad than with us, and as much of what has already been said in this 
report applies equally to both sexes, we need only add that if, among its other 
efforts, a school such as has been here indicated can effectually assist women to 
support themselves and to earn an independent position it will proye a boon to the 
community. 
Training for teachers.—It may reasonably be doubted whether, considering the 
vital importance to the community of the teaching staff of our elementary schools, 
anything like sufficient care has been given to the training of teachers in matters 
relating to technical instruction. This branch of work may well engage the atten- 
tion of the directors of such an institution. 
Conclusion.—The field is wide enough—science and art as applied to engineering, 
spinning, weaving, dyeing, printing, and all the varied industries of which Man- 
chester is the center. Already a good beginning has been made. The extent and 
success of the school-board work in the evening classes demand our acknowledg- 
ments and congratulations, and the technical school under all its difficulties has 
done great things. It remains for the Manchester corporation to press forward the 
work and to enlarge its scope, and we desire to express the opinion that in doing 
so we shall not only be accepting a duty but acting so as to stimulate the material 
prosperity of our city. Manchester was the first pl&ce to accept and put into force 
the free publie libraries act, and there is now an opportunity of again taking a 
step forward in the direction of popular education. 
The ideal school of Manchester would be one the analogue of which is found in the 
great art school of Vienna, which is designed to teach the application of art to 
industry, and in the Polytechnicum of Zurich, with the difference that, whereas at 
Zurich the science teaching aims at the highest theoretical training, such as the 
Owens College offers, ours should aim more especially at its practical application. 
In it also should be given commercial training of the highest order. Such a school 
might well call forth our best efforts, and, if made sufficiently comprehensive, might 
perhaps insure cooperation and aid from other county councils. Adequately carried 
out, with ample space and equipment, it would place our city in the most favored 
position in regard to the technical instruction of its people. 
Citations from the report of a deputation appointed in 1891 by the council of the Manches- 
ter Technical School to visit and report upon certain technical schocls and institutions 
on the continent and in England. 
There is in every continental city we visit abundant and striking evidence of the 
interest taken in the education of the people of all classes. Schools abound every- 
where, and all are so organized and graded that no gap exists between the lowest 
communal school and the highest educational institution. The importance of scien- 
tific instruction and training is exemplified in the numerous technical and industrial 
schools of every kind, which are accessible to the poorest, and especially to those 
who show capacity. So far as we could observe, there is no attempt to confine the 
benefits of these institutions, however advanced their character, to any particular 
class. They are open to the fit and capable of all ranks of industrial life. Nothing, for 
example, can more evidently manifest the importance attached to technical training 
by the German Government than the fact that, while the schools for general culture 
are under the supervision of the minister of instruction, those for technical teaching
-P-A-G-E-164

  are placed in the hands of the minister of commerce. The industries of the country 
and the means of educating those engaged in them in the principles which underlie 
their successful development are thus closely and officially associated and their inter- 
dependence clearly proclaimed. Measured by our standard, the fees are nominal; in 
some cases, like that of Roubaix (weaving and dyeing), not only are there no fees but 
all materials are gratuitously supplied. In every instance there are numerous free 
places for those unable to pay the fees. The abundant supply of preparatory schools, 
the extended school age, ranging up to fourteen years, and the ample provision for 
continued evening education, have created a large b. dy of well-prepared students, 
who are therefore much more numerous than is the case in this country. There is, 
hence, no difficulty in providing recruits to the higher scientific and technical insti- 
tutions. This has had two results: first, the supply of a large number of well- 
trained foremen, managers, and employers; secondly, the creation of a class of com- 
petent men as teachers of science and technology. The forethought of continental 
governments in this respect may be compared, in several very interesting and strik- 
ing directions, with our own want of prevision. For instance, when this council 
has required the services of a competent instructor of the chemical, dyeing, and 
calico-printing classes, it has been found indispensable to engage one who has been 
trained in a foreign technological institution for that importan+ section of its work; 
and it is well known that many of our leading firms experience almost insuperable 
difficulty in finding among our own countrymen that combination of scientific with 
practical knowledge by which alone they can hope to compete with their continen- 
tal rivals. 
There is no pretense that the fees in any of these institutions can be made to defray 
their expenses except in rare instances, and where they do so it will be found, as 
in the case of Muhlhausen, that the schools are in the hands of the manufacturers, 
and very high fees are charged. It is recognized as a duty by the municipality and 
the government that the amplest provision should be made and no expense spared 
to provide the best buildings, the most complete equipment, and the most efficient 
teaching. It is accepted as an axiom that industrial progress largely depends, and 
will more and more depend, upon scientific knowledge and artistic skill, and that 
the race is not so much to the strong as to the well informed and thoroughly trained. 
If this be true, there is little doubt that the efforts now being made by continental 
nations are deserving of our most serious attention. 
We received information which shows that the danger to our industries by the 
better-instructed managers of continental manufacturing concerns is by no means 
imaginary. We are annually importing, principally from Germany and Switzer- 
land, about three million pounds in value of chemical manufactures, coal-tar dyes, 
colors, and pigments, without reckoning medicinal preparations. There is no 
sound reason whatever, except the want of high technical training, why all these 
products might not be made in England, whence the greater portion of the raw 
material required for their manufacture is obtained. In like manner such branches 
of manufacture as braids, trimmings, and thread gloves, formerly a considerable 
business here, together with other articles of trade, have been latterly carried off 
to the continent, which now largely supplies these goods to our English market. 
We were especially struck with the instance of Switzerland, a country laboring 
under many and great disadvantages. It is obliged to import all its raw materials 
and export its manufactures under great disabilities of cost of carriage and distance 
from its sources of supply and sale, yet it succeeds in carrying on a considerable for- 
eign trade, especially in fine chemicals, the creation of which is due entirely to its 
splendid polytechnic school at Zurich. We were, moreover, impressed with the fact 
that Switzerland is engaged in a new industry, namely, the manufacture and export 
of highly educated scientific men. It is recognized that the country is too small to 
support its increasing population; that its sons must obtain their living elsewhere 
than in their own land, and that to enable them to do so with success the means of
-P-A-G-E-165
  
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 137 
obtaining the finest scientific training must accordingly be thrown open to every 
capable Swiss on nominal terms. 
There is no district on the continent which can for a moment compare in indus- 
trial importance with that of which Manchester is the center. The engineering, tex- 
tile, and dyeing and printing industries here immensely transcend in extent and 
value those carried on in a like area in any foreign country; and yet the means we 
possess of training those who are to have the management of our great industrial 
concerns, or those among our working classes who may rightly aspire to positions of 
trust by reason of natural fitness and aptitude, would certainly not compare with 
the provisions made in a second-rate German or Swiss manufacturing town. 
It has been said that our workshops are the finest technical schools in the world; 
but to say this and expect it to be taken as a final and sufficient reply to all demands 
for additional means of technical instruction is to mistake the meaning and object 
of technical training. By this should properly be understood that education which 
enables a man to grasp and turn to account those scientific principles upon which 
our industries depend. Moreover, the conditions of workshop life do not permit of 
that combination of theoretical study with practical instruction which the Seon 
eal school is intended to supply. 
We do not suggest that the methods of continental countries should be followed 
in all respects. The conditions of industrial life are not the same here as there, and 
modifications to suit our-own peculiar circumstances and needs are therefore neces- 
sary. We are convinced, howeyer, that the advantages of industrial education there 
enjoyed ought to be placed within the reach of our own countrymen to an equal 
extent. 
At Crefeld, for example, your deputation met three young Englishmen who had 
been students in the spinning and weaving branch of our technical school in Peter 
street, and who had come to Crefeld in order to obtain a thorough training in the 
spinning, weaving, and dyeing of silk. These youths had been detached from home 
influences, and, at great expense, been sent to a foreign country to learn what ought 
to have been accessible to them at their own doors—surely a potent argument for 
the extension of our work in a new and enlarged building. 
We submit that Manchester requires the establishment of a technical school of the 
highest character; that is to say, a building adequate in space and accommodation 
to the needs of its important engineering, building, textile, and chemical trades, 
together with a complete staff of competent teachers, and an ample equipment for 
effective practical instruction by means of laboratories, workshop appliances, appa- 
ratus, models, and examples. 
The experience of foreign countries shows conclusively that such a school can not 
be made self-supporting; that, on the contrary, the lower its fees, if safeguarded 
by suitable entrance examinations, the more service it can render to the community. 
With a view of bringing the school within the reach of the working classes, 
numerous competitive scholarships, extending over two or three years, are necessary, 
by which may be provided the outlay for fees and books, and, in some measure, the 
loss in wages. 
An institution of such magnitude can not, withany security for its effective work- 
ing and development, be left to depend on private resources or on uncertain means 
of income; and it would therefore, perhaps, be most suitably supported from public 
funds, such as those now available under the technical instruction act, 1889, and 
the customs and excise act, 1890. As a matter of course, adequate representation 
under such conditions would be provided.

TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN GERMANY, AUSTRIA, AND SWITZERLAND. 
INTRODUCTION, 
How to prepare the teachers for their profession, or (if the reader is 
disinclined to admit that there is a teaching profession) their occupa- 
tion, is undoubtedly one of the most important educational questions. 
The elevation of the common school depends upon it; indeed, the degree 
of general and professional culture of teachers determines the degree 
of culture of the vast majority of the young, and even of the entire people. 
This causal connection between the general culture of a nation and the 
instructors of its children, stamps the question under discussion a state 
question, a question of policy as momentous as the establishment and 
maintenance of schools themselves. 
True it is that the facilities for acquiring knowledge, after school age 
is passed, are abundant; all the agencies of modern life, the press,

  public business, and rapid communication make knowledge easily 
accessible; but the discipline which school alone gives, life can not 
furnish. 
_ If, then, we bear in mind that the elementary school is not merely a 
“knowledge shop,” an institution for the acquisition of the elements of 
knowledge, but a place where the young are to be trained to become 
“intellectually active, civilly useful, and morally good men and women,” ! 
we shall see how important is the question of proper preparation of 
teachers. The value of a school is always in exact proportion to that 
of the teacher, hence the elevation of his intellectual and moral culture 
is necessarily the first step to be taken in reforming or improving the 
schools. To the recognition of this self-evident truth we owe the estab- 
lishment of special institutions for the preparation of elementary school 
teachers. 
Naturally, in looking about among the nations of the civilized world 
to ascertain what had been done in this direction, the attention of 
the French authorities was directed to Germany, or, properly speaking, 
to the German-speaking nations. During the administration of M. 
Guizot the French minister of public education, M. Cousin, visited sey- 
eral states of Germany, and reported to his superiors upon the condition 
and organization of schools in that country, particularly in Prussia. 
A large part of his report was devoted to the Prussian training schools 
for elementary teachers. He translated the name Schullehrer-semi- 
narien by the term Ecoles normales primaires. The fact that similar 
institutions in the States of New York and Massachusetts were called 
normal schools (literally model, or proper schools) proves that Cousin’s 
report was read by the educational authorities in this country when 
they established such schools. Of Horace Mann, the secretary of the 
Massachusetts State Board of Education, the notable reformer of 
American schools, we know that he inspected the German schools, and 
held them up as models to be followed. Likewise, in England the Ger- 
man teachers’ training schools were taken as models for similar insti- 
tutions through the influence of Matthew Arnold and Joseph Payne; 
only here they were called ‘teachers’ training colleges.” Thus we see 
that the civilized nations assiduously studied and imitated the German 
system of professional training of teachers. 
Says Dr. Ed. S. Joynes, professor of modern languages in the Uni- 
versity of South Carolina: 
Germany has now become the schoolmistress of the world. The distinctive 
qualities of the German mind—industry, patience, microscopic precision, combined 
with high ideality, depth of insight, with height and breadth of view and thorough 
intellectual consciousness—have made the Germans first in every department of 
research and scholarship. As investigators and teachers they are unrivaled. Their 
schools, seminaries, and universities are the foremost in the world. In almost every 
department of pure or applied science they lead—in some without competitors. In 
the regions of abstract thought or of pure scholarship, their preéminence is still 
more decided. All the civilized world gocs to school to Germany.

  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 141 
The German teachers’ seminaries are the pioneer institutions for pro- 
fessional training of teachers; hence a historical review of the normal- 
school movement in central Europe, accompanied by an exact state- 
ment of the present status, will give us a firm basis of comparison with 
our own institutions. “If thou wouldst know thyself, look at others; 
if others, look into thine own heart.” 
I.—HISTORICAL REVIEW. 
Wherever a school degenerates, it does so because of its teachers; wherever a 
school advances, it is by means of better teachers. There is no other way. (Dies- 
terweg.) 
In Germany, where the “people’s school” (elementary school) came 
into existence through the impetus which Martin Luther gave to gen- 
eral education, it was Duke Ernest (the Pious) of Saxe-Gotha, who, 
first among the numerous rulers of Germany, conceived the idea of 
establishing institutions for the practical preparation of teachers. This 
was during the second half of the seventeenth century. Death, how- 
ever, prevented him from executing his plan, which was realized by his 
grandson, Duke Frederick II (1693-1732). He established in his small 
dominions ten normal schools (Lehrerbildungs-Anstalten), called “‘sem- 
inaria scholastica.” It was done by inducing ten of the best school- 
masters to aid applicants for positions in preparing themselves for the 
vocation. Buildings were not erected for the purpose. 
In connection with this historical fact, it may be well to show the 
origin of the word Seminar, or seminary, which is the technical term in 
Germany for normal schools, or professional schools for teachers. The 
word seminariwm, from semen (Seed), means seed-bed or nursery, and is 
very old. Livy used the word in a figurative sense when he called the 
Roman equites the nursery (seminariwm) of the senate. Cicero called 
the forum the nursery of oratory. During the Middle Ages, convent 
schools in which the clergy were prepared were called seminaria, and 
later, after the revival of letters, the classical schools were termed sem- 
inaria-humanitatis. The technical term seminar (in German), applied 
to teachers’ professional schools, came into use much later, since, 
previous to the seventeenth century, no one thought of professional 
preparation of teachers, but the close connection of school and church 
made the application of the technical name for priests’ schools to 
teachers’ schools a matter of self-evidence. 
A. H. Francke (1663-1727), the founder of the great educational insti- 
tutions in Halle, saw the absolute necessity of well-educated teachers, 
and founded his seminarium preceptorum, which was, however, more 
intended for secondary*teachers. 
The first real normal school or seminary for elementary school teach- 
ers in Germany was established in Berlin by J. J. Jecker, in 1747, 
who connected with his realschule (modern high school), a school for 
teachers where young men received professional training, so that they
-P-A-G-E-170
    142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
could take positions in the parish of Trinity Church. To the capital of 
modern Germany, then, we may credit the beginning of that movement 
which has since been followed in all civilized nations. In rapid suc- 
cession other normal schools or seminaries have since been established 
all over Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. 
These normal schools were not independent institutions, but were 
connected with other schools, such as city schools, gymnasia, real- 
schulen, and orphan asylums. The students participated in the com- 
mon instruction, and besides received special lessons in pedagogy, 
eatechetics, music, ete. At the same time, and from the very begin- 
ning of normal schools in Germany, it was made the rule that the stu- 
dents should get practical preparation by actual teaching in experi- 
mental or practice classes. Until the beginning of the nineteenth cen- 
tury the instruction offered in the normal schools was confined to the 
common-school branches and accomplishments. 
Since then, and especially since the memorable rejuvenation of Prus- 
sia after 1806, normal schools have been greatly improved in their 
organization, aims, and results; but along with the great diffusion of 
knowledge, with the development of the science of pedagogy and the 
increased demands made upon the elementary schools an opposition to 
the normal schools planned merely as a continuation of the elementary 
schools, arose, which spread in ever-widening circles through Germany, 
Austria, and Switzerland. In thé last-named country the agitation 
has not yet quite ceased. 
“A glance into the history of our seminaries,” says Dr. Rein,! 
“would show us that the development of the teacher’s education has 
followed more in the wake of accidental needs—and hence often 
entered upon wrong roads—than a uniform plan, which, based upon 
principles, would have led on to a gradual completion of the proposed 
structure.” 
The first attack upon the normal schools in Germany was made at 
the beginning of this century. In. 1809 an essay appeared in the 
Silesian Provincial Gazette, entitled, “Some obstacles in the way of 
progress of our country schools.” The author complained about ‘the 
unsatisfactory results of the elementary schools, and about the conceit 
of the teachers who had graduated from normal schools. Mr. Daniel 
Kriiger, the principal of a normal school, replied to this attack, prais- 
ing the practical skill of normal graduates and lessening the force of 
the reproach that they were trained to pride and refractoriness. 
In 1824, Pustkuchen, in his book Criticism of the Schools, eriti- 
cised the normal schools severely. He blamed them for trying to make 
of their students universally educated men, without the requisite of a 
thorough secondary (or preparatory) training, and, as he stated it, “for 
allowing them to taste all possible fruit of science, and failing to give 
opportunity for thorough digestion andassimilation.” * * * “Even

  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 1438 
the most renowned seminaries,” he said, “resemble those brilliant ‘fin- 
ishing schools, in which pupils know everything so long as they are 
in school and the froth bubbles over the edge of the glass, but who 
really know nothing well when examined five years later.” 
In 1828 the Bavarian school inspector, Dr. H. Stephani (the rein- 
ventor of the phonetic method of teaching reading, now universally 
applied in Germany) was dissatisfied with the results of the normal 
scltools as then conducted, and said in his book (On Gymnasia, their 
True Object, etc.) that the preparatory education of all who intend to 
devote their lives to teaching should be acquired in classical high 
schools (gymnasia); but in these schools three languages should be 
taught as obligatory studies: German, the mother tongue; Greek, the 
language of the most cultivated people in history, and a modern lan- 
guage (French, English, or Italian). He wrote: 
Our normal schools have hitherto not been able to do what they might have 
accomplished. They admit students who are insufficiently prepared, and fritter 
away valuable time in filling gaps in the student’s education, which time might be 
more profitably employed in the real art and science of education. That, neverthe- 
less, we find among elementary teachers so many well-educated men, is not to be 
credited to the efforts of normal schools, but to individual talents and love of culture. 
If the education of the whole nation is to be improved, it will be necessary first to 
educate the teachers better, and to give them a technical preparation commensurate 
with the duties they are to perform. 
With still greater emphasis Dr. Weber, of Bremen, insisted upon a 
preparatory training of normal school students in secondary colleges, 
at least up to the senior class; but instead of a modern language, he 
favored Latin. During the decade from 1830 to 1840, the criticism of the 
normal schools became general all over Germany, and men of all grades 
of society demanded a better preparation, saying that the normal 
school should be a professional school, pure and simple. The teachers 
themselves raised. their voices, claiming that the superficial training 
they had received in the normal school almost disqualified them from 
acquiring a better intellectual education after graduation. They 
claimed this to be based upon experience. 
Wuntschli demanded, in his Pedagogical Letters from the Rhine 
(1845), that the teachers, like all other professional people, should 
receive their general education in secondary schools that lead up to the 
university, which should be the common vestibule of all the learned 
professions. The state should apply the appropriation, now used for 
maintaining normal schools, for the support of candidates in secondary 
and higher seats of learning; and it should appoint professors of ped- 
agogy, didactics, and methodology in the latter. He, too, thought that 
the training of normal-school students was anything but advantageous 
for subsequent acquisition of intellectual culture, saying, “that there 
is so much beautiful order in normal schools, so much diligence and 
punctuality, that at first glance one is delighted, but it will not do 
to make a minute inspection, for soon the fact is revealed that most

of the work consists of soulless mechanical drill, and that the will of 
the students and their characteristic traits are stifled. Youths,” he 
said, “who are ordered when to eat, pray, work, and sleep are scarcely 
able to move about in life with freedom and ease.” 
Harcort, in his Conditions: of the People’s School (1846), denounced 
the convent life of the normal-school students. 
  Young men who are expected to educate children for life should learn to know life, 
so that they may utilize its educating momenta, counteract its degenerating influ- 
ences, and thus meet the just demands of life. The feeling of independence and 
self-reliance underlying every manly character can only be acquired and fostered if 
the young men are frequently allowed to determine their own actions. 
The powerful political movement of 1848 (commonly styled the revo- 
Jution of 1848) made itself felt in the schools. Scareely had the events 
of March, 1848, given to the Germans the right of free speech and 
unmolested meeting, when the teachers began to raise their voices and 
give expression to their wishes and opinions. Numerous teachers’ 
meetings were held, and petitions sent to the Government. As early 
as March 31 of that year Dr. Friedrich Kopp, the principal of a gym- 
nasium in Hamm, Prussia (province Westphalia), published an 
“Appeal for reform of German national education,” the thirty para- 
graphs of which gave rise to frequent discussions in meetings and in 
print. The principles Dr. Kopp expressed were generally accepted by 
the teachers’ fraternity. 
The greatest success of all the many petitions prepared was the one 
composed by a deliberative assembly of 600 teachers in Berlin, and 
addressed to the deputies and representatives of the people of Prus- 
sia. The main points of this petition referring to the training of 
teachers were: 
(1) The professional school for teachers should be a branch of the university and 
should offer both a theoretical and a practical education. (2) He who intends to 
devote himself to the profession of teaching must. have graduated from a second- 
ary school that leads up to the university. 
This example of public discussion of their own interests, given by 
the teachers in Berlin, was followed by others in the chief cities of the 
Kingdom of Prussia, and other parts of Germany. We quote some of 
the expressions of that period to show the divergence of opinion: 
(1) According to the Dill of rights it must be left free to him who intends to 
devote himself to teaching to prepare himself for that purpose in the way he sees 
fit. (The teachers of Frankfort and Gittingen.) 
(2) The normal schools (Seminarien) are the only and hence necessary institutions 
of learning for elementary teachers. Every candidate for a position as teacher must 
have passed through a normal school.. (Teachers in Pomerania.) 
(3) Normal schools should be established in university towns where candidates 
may have opportunities for hearing the lectures. (Teachers in the provinces of 
Silesia, Brandenburg, and Prussia.) 
(4) In all university towns, and, if advisable, in other large cities, institutions for 
theoretical and practical training of teachers shall be established. (Teachers in 
Prussia and Saxony.)
-P-A-G-E-173
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 145 
  (5) The conditions for admission to a normal school should be the preparation 
offered in a secondary school, end should not be less than is required for graduation 
from a ‘‘ higher citizens’ school;” in addition to this, the necessary musical prepara- 
tion should be required. (Teachers in Silesia, Saxony, Posen, Pomerania, and West- 
phalia.) 
(6) Candidates for admission to the seminary must prove to be in possession of the 
necessary technical accomplishments, as well as the same degree of scientific training 
required of graduates of modern high schools (Realschulen), ma the exception of 
the study of Latin and English. (Rhenish Prussia.) 
(7) Tho state has the duty to organize the secondary schools in such a way that in 
them candidates for the profession of teaching may obtain a preparatory education 
which will entitle them to admission to higher seats of learning. (Frankfort.) 
(8) The convent or barrack life of the students of normal schools must cease. 
(Silesia and Brandenburg.) 
(9) The student must be freed from convent discipline. (Pomerania.) 
(10) In future no dormitories shall be connected with normal schools, but the 
students may board in private families; they must have the liberty of university 
students. (Posen and Mecklenburg.) 
Even in the national assembly at Frankfort the school reform prob- 
lem was ventilated repeatedly. The following are some of the resolu- 
tions of that famous congress: 
(1) Knowledge and the teaching of knowledge are free. (2) Supervision of educa- 
tional institutions is reserved exclusively for the state, and is, except with respect to 
religious instruction, withdrawn from the clergy. (3) The establishment of educa- 
tional institutions is free and the profession of teaching open to everyone who can 
prove to the satisfaction of the authorities that he is capable and sufficiently pre- 
pared. (4) Instruction in the people’s and lower industrial schools is gratuitous. 
(5) Indigent pupils shall be admitted free in any public school of whatever descrip- 
tion or degree. (6) It is left free to everyone to choose his own profession and to 
* prepare himself for it as he thinks fit. 
In Bavaria the reorganization of the training of teachers was com- 
menced energetically. In October, 1848, a meeting of the cireuit school 
inspectors of the Kingdom was held, Pres. v. Welden, a high govern- 
ment officer, in the chair. The subject of discussion was a new scheme 
of regulations prepared by Dr. Jacobi, expressing fundamental prin- 
ciples which found enthusiastic approval among the teachers of the 
Kingdom and other parts of Germany. Dr. Jacobi recommended the 
abolishment of the normal schools with their antiquated preparatory 
institutions and the establishment of new preparatory schools for 
teachers, the graduates of which would have to enter higher profes- 
sional schools (pedagogiums) or the university. He thought that admis- 
sion to these higher professional schools should be granted to all grad- 
uates of preparatory schools and to those who had passed the gradua- 
tion examination without having attended the schools. He claimed 
that the young would-be teacher should be educated, like the candi- 
dates of any other profession, in the family and public life, “for the 
future teacher must grow up in liberty, and liberty is to make him 
worthy of its blessings.” The professional course in the pedagogium 
was to be followed by a three years’ course of practice in school. Those, 
however, who aimed at leading positions and reached a certain degree of

excellence in their studies were to be allowed to enter universities, there 
to attend pedagogical lectures and others which would promote general 
culture. After the completion of this course such candidates would 
have a first claim upon positions in secondary and normal schools. 
A Congress of 900 teachers of the Kingdom of Saxony (August 3-6, 
1848) adopted the following resolutions: 
The teachers of the various pablic educational iastitutions should acquire the 
necessary knowledge and preparatory training in secondary schools (either classical 
or modern, Gymnasia or Realschulen), and after that obtain a professional training 
in normal schools (seminaries) which are equal to the advanced demands of the 
time, and in which graduates of universities act as teachers who have proved to be 
excellent theoretical and practical educators. To confine the students of normal 
schools to barracks should not be allowed. 
All the beautiful hopes and expectations arising from the revolu- 
tionary movement in 1848 were shattered when the political reaction 
set in, and the conservative governments in Germany succeeded, at the 
point of the bayonet, in reestablishing the old order of things. After 
the waves of the eventful years 1548 and 1849 had calmed down every- 
thing was removed which recalled the attempts at liberating and ele- 
vating the profession of teaching. 
Prussia, which after the calamitous year 1806~7 had devoted itself 
to the promotion and elevation of elementary schools by establishing 
normal schools and directing the entire educational system of the 
Kingdom in the Pestalozzian spirit, thus giving a shining example to 
all the other states in Germany, this same Prussia now contemplated 
the abolition of all normal schools. According to the ideas of the 
conservative party then in power, the elementary school had not stood 
the test; had not proved an institution destined to preserve the state. 
Had not [said Curtmann, in his Reform of the People’s School] the years 1848 and 
1849 which had opened so many “ whited sepulchers” also torn away the veil of 
imaginary excellencies of the German school system and exposed to view its with- 
ered, distorted countenance? After the schools, through Dinter’s successful work 
of supervision, had become a nursery of tame, flat, self-satisfied rationalism, they 
had, through Disterweg’s agitation, since 1830 assumed a naturalistic-democratic 
air, and, next to the army of literary paupers, no profession worked so assiduously 
and so successfully in poisoning mind and heart of the German people as did the 
teachers of the people’s schools, 
Thus spoke the conservatives who honestly endeavored to recon- 
struct the schools upon the old basis, regardless of the progressive ideas 
_ of the age. - They asked that the schools be supervised and the teachers 
be prepared by the clergy, and that the normal schools be abolished. 
Thus, they claimed, the candidates for teaching would be prepared “in 
school for the school.” In the elementary school they could daily hear 
good lessons and profit partly by observation, partly by helping the 
teacher in his work. It was the old Lancasterian system of pupil- 
teachers which was recommended. If more knowledge was required 
than an elementary school offered, it might be acquired after school 
hours under guidance of the head teacher, or the clergyman, or by
-P-A-G-E-175
  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 147 
means of private study. These were the guiding thoughts and the 
course advocated by the leading men of the conservative government. 
But every extreme movement causes a countercurrent. Pamphlets 
advocating a retorm appeared which advocated too high a degree of 
theoretical training of teachers. The work of Dr. J. Leutbecher (1850) 
belongs to this class of reform literature. His plan embraced two 
different grades of professional schoors for teachers; the lower normal 
school should admit only graduates of classical or modern colleges, for 
“the state,” he argued, “has the unquestioned duty to give to young 
men, who intend to devote themseives to teaching, a thorough and 
extensive preparation. Heretofore the state has been remiss in its 
duty, and the result has been a fragmentary professional culture 
which produced questionable results in school. So-called preparatory 
schools for future students of normal schools are not to my taste.” 
Preparatory general training should consist in (1) religion, (2) language 
(mother-tongue above all, but also French, or English, and Latin), (3) 
mathematics and natural science,—upon these branches should be 
based an encyclopedical study of professions which rely upon the 
mathematical, physical, and chemical sciences,—{4) anthropology and. 
history, (5) calligraphy, drawing, and modeling, (6) singing, (7) gym- 
nastics. 
The proper professional training, the author claimed, should be 
required in higher pedagogical seminaries and in the pedagogical fac- 
ulty of a university, the course to be one of four years, with the follow- 
ing scheme of studies: 
LI year. Dogmatices and history of dogmas (of the various religions in the state); 
German grammar, composition, and rhetoric; history of the German language and 
literature; encyclopedia, mythology, literature, and history of mathematical-phys- 
ical sciences; some of the anthropological-histor:cal branches; general history of 
civilization. 
lL year. The course of this year would approach the object of a pedagogical school 
by opening before the eyes of the student the entire realm of knowledge neces- 
sary for his vocation in form of an encyclopedia and methodology of educational 
sciences and a presentation of a comprehensive picture of human knowledge in its 
various relations to one’s fellow beings, to nature, and to God. 
III year. During the third year of the course the student would have to familiar- 
ize himself with the fundamental science of education, that is, metaphysics or psy- 
chology, with the principles of the sciences of theology, ethics, and civil govern- 
ment, with the science of art, the philosophy of hisSory,—in short, with the ideals of 
mankind. = 
IV year. After the candidate has thus stocked himself with the best obtainable 
information, he could during the last year of the course devote himself with enthu- 
siasm to his own professional science. ‘ 
This plan of study, which proposed to elevate the teachers’ profes- 
sional training to a hitherto unheard-of degree, found, strange to say, 
numerous enthusiastic adherents, and gave an impetus to similar plans 
with aims equally inaccessible. Opposition to normal schools, inaugu- 
rated by the reactionary party, soon lost strength, and with the begin- 
ning of the fifth decade a more liberal spirit began to exert itself.
-P-A-G-E-176
148 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  Supported by public opinion, it was again the teachers themselves who 
emphatically demanded a better scientific preparation and professional 
training. In inass-meetings and the press the normal school problem 
was ventilated, and governmental authorities were petitioned to reform 
the entire system of normal schools. The Bavarian Teachers’ Associa- 
tion demanded, in 1864, a radical reform of the preparatory institutions, 
from which the students went into the normal schools, saying that the 
students were too poorly prepared to take up the normal school studies. 
They claimed that the preparatory general culture should be obtained 
in modern secondary schools (Realgymnasia); the course pursued there 
was fully equivalent to that which normal schools required as a basis 
for professional work. A preparation less comprehensive in scope and 
extent than afforded in the Realgymnasia could not suffice. Normal 
schools proper should have a three years’ course, and be situated in 
jarge cities. Dormitories or closed institutions should not be tolerated. 
In 1871, the German National Teachers’ Association meeting in 
Vienna adopted, by an overwhelming majority, the following resolu- 
tions: 
Students (Seminarisis) should receive their general preparation for admission to 
the normal schools in public secondary schools (Gymnasia or Realschulen). The 
German normal school (Lehrerseminar) should be a professional school for popular 
(volsthiimliche) pedagogy, which builds upon the foundation of a thorough general 
human culture (Allgemeine Menschenbildung). 
In 1872, the same association met in Hamburg, and again the profes- 
sional training of teachers formed the chief topic of discussion. Prof. 
Kehr (principal of the normal school in Halberstadt) was the principal 
speaker. He pointed to the fact that a division into schools for general 
preparatory culture and for specific professional training had already 
become a settled policy everywhere for other professions, but not for 
teachers. The teachers’ normal schools were in this, as well as in other 
regards, an exception to a policy accepted universally; they were hybrid 
forms, trying to accomplish too much, worrying their students through 
all branches of knowledge, and despite all this, or rather on account of 
it, they could not accomplish what under more favorable circumstances 
they might easily accomplish. So long as the demand is made that 
normal schools are to be schools for general culture and specific profes- 
sional schools at the same time, so long as the professors have to main- 
tain this double character, the results will remain fragmentary. The 
speaker said: 
At present they can not be wholly professional schools, because they are obliged 
to occupy the largest part of their time in teaching religion, language, arithmetic, 
‘mathematics, geography, history, natural science and natural history, calligraphy, 
drawing, music, and gymnastics. And they can not promote a general preparatory 
-education satisfactorily because the pedagogical training requires not only time but 
it necessitates limitations which prove obstacles to general culture. Our seminaries 
must sever these unnatural ties. It must come to this, that properly organized pre- 
paratory schools will furnish a sound, extensive secondary education, and the semi- 
naries a professional pedagogic training exclusively. 
    
-P-A-G-E-177
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 149 
  Kehr also denounced the preparatory schools then in existence in 
Prussia, because they based their work solely on the results of the ele- 
mentary school, and with equal emphasis he criticised the official order 
in force in Gotha, which makes a few years’ attendance upon a classical 
college (gymnasium) a requirement of admission to the normal school. 
For this he advanced the following arguments: (1) A gymnasium edu- 
cation is too expensive for teachers; (2) pupils who study ancient or 
modern languages in a secondary school are apt to complete the course 
and aim higher, that is, enter the university, and hence are lost to the 
profession of teaching in elementary schools; (3) the education offered 
in a gymnasium is too fragmentary, and, owing to its one-sidedness, is 
not suitable for a thorough basis of a professional pedagogical train- 
ing; (4) the education offered by German secondary schools is gener- 
ally different from a normal school education. Hence, the speaker advo- 
cated the establishment of secondary preparatory schools, which would 
stand in the same relation to normal schools in which the gymnasium 
stands to the university. He declared the gymnasium with its course 
in ancient languages to be a preparatory school for the learned pro- 
fessions; the Real-schule, with its course in modern languages and nat- 
ural sciences, to prepare for industrial pursuits, technical arts, and 
administrative offices; and there should be a third kind of preparatory 
schools which would properly prepare for the teaching profession. The 
best plan seemed to him to use the existing city continuation schools for 
that purpose, since they were organically, in matter and methods, con- 
nected with the people’s or elementary schools, and could in their four 
year’s course advance the students in knowledge and accomplishments; 
add a modern language and instrumental music, and they would then 
develop to a degree commensurate with the just demands of the German 
middle classes. It must be borne in mind that in Germany a common 
school for all classes of society does not exist, and that nearly all plans 
for reforming educational institutions are affected by considerations 
of class distinctions. 
Atter several other noted speakers had indorsed Dr. Kehr’s views, 
the meeting adopted the following resolutions: é 
(1) The German normal schools should be pedagogical professional schools. (2) 
The acquisition of a general culture should take place in the preparatory schools. 
(3) The preparatory school should have a course of four years, the professional 
school one of two years. (4) Whether the two institutions should be organically 
connected or whether a citizens’ school should be made the preparatory school must 
depend upon local circumstances. (5) Admission to the normal school should be 
dependent upon an examination. 
The sharp, and at times acrimonious, criticism of the German normal 
schools, sketched in the foregoing pages, has not resulted in their 
abolishment, but has led to their better and more rational organiza- 
tion. Above all, general and professional education have been more 
distinctly separated than formerly*throughout the country, and much 
greater care has been bestowed upon preparatory training. The    
 
-P-A-G-E-178
    150 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
special preparatory schools, formerly private schools, have been made 
state institutions. The course of study in the professional classes has 
been extended, both in scope and time, in accordance with the increased 
demands of modern life; the institutions have been generally improved, 
and scientific aids, museums, and other means of instruction, have been 
added, all of which has tended to silence opposition and disarm the 
eritics of the normal schools. Complaints concerning deficiency of the 
normal schools for elementary teachers in Germany and criticism of 
their organization, object, scope and results have almost ceased. Com- 
petent judges, educational men of authority in Germany and other coun- 
tries, men who have had opportunities to judge from observation, almost 
unanimously state that the level of professional training has been raised 
quite considerably in Germany during the last twenty years. They say 
that scarcely another country can be found in which the teachers are 
so enthusiastic in their work, so earnestly striving for the elevation of 
the school, and the promotion of popular education, and where they 
are so consistently prepared for such work, as in Germany. Nowhere 
is the educational literature so extensive and rich in progressive thought 
as in Germany. And with the gradual elevation of the German 
teachers the development of the schools has gone hand in hand. The 
peoples’ or elementary school, which contains more than 90 per cent of 
all the children of school-going age, has become an institution upon 
which great consideration is bestowed by the state and its various 
organs; and the teachers have formed a national union that has nearly 
60,000 members, and makes its wishes and just claims known to the 
legislative bodies, and its influence felt at the hearth-stone of nearly 
every family in the Empire. 
The present status of the normal school question is sketched by Dr. 
H. Rein (see previous reference) in the following words: “There are, 
regardless of minor and insignificant differences, essentially two systems 
prevailing in Germany. Both build upon the results of the elementary 
school; both claim six years for the completion of their courses. The 
only essential difference existing is as to whether these six years should 
be spent in one institution or in two separate ones. In other words, 
whether the general and the professional training be organically con- 
nected in one school, or be kept apart internally and externally. The 
first of these systems prevails in the Kingdom of Saxony, the other in 
Prussia, Bavaria, and Wiirtemberg, and other German states. Austria 
has so long been part and parcel of Germany that the discussion of 
this question there has taken almost the same course it took in 
Germany.” 
In Switzerland professional training of teachers has also been a 
subject of much discussion, and at times a bone of contention, 
especially in the cantons (states) of Graubiinden, Luzerne, Aargau, 
Thurgau, Ziirich, Berne, Soleure, and Vaud. Indeed, it can be said 
that the question is not yet quite settled. The first normal school for
-P-A-G-E-179

teachers in Switzerland was established in the canton of Luzerne. 
Abbot Benedict, of St. Urban (1768-1781), established in his abbey 
two educational institutions, one for the youths of the upper class of 
society of Luzerne, in order to prepare them for positions in the Goy- 
ernment service; the other, which he called normal school, for the pur- 
pose of training young teachers for rural districts. The work begun 
by Abbot Benedict was continued by his successors, Martin Balthasar, 
of Luzerne, and Karl Ambrosius Gentz, of Soleure. 
The honor of having founded the first state normal school belongs to 
the canton Aargau; it was opened in 1822. The development of the 
entire Swiss educational system has been essentially aided by the Swiss 
Society for the Common Weal, and particularly did the professional 
training of teachers receive the society’s attention and care. As early 
as 1825, Rev. Mr. Wirz reported upon the results of the different can- 
tons in public instruction and preparation of teachers. In 1826, the 
society received two reports, one of Rector Hanhart and one of Father 
Girard. The former advocated separate teachers’ seminaries after the 
German plan, the latter normal (or model) schools. Hanhart being a 
German, and searching for suggestions among German sources, natu- 
rally leaned toward German models. Girard, of French origin, looked 
for French models and French institutions, and adopted French tech- 
nical terms, the term for institutions of professional training in France 
being normal, which means model, schools. The people were disinclined 
to adopt the term seminary, because it was coupled with the idea of 
its being a professional school for theclergy. The term generally used 
in German cantons is Lehrerbildungs—Anstalt (Institution for the Train- 
ing of Teachers). In French cantons the term Beole-Normale (normal 
school) is used. 
In a subsequent chapter we shall describe the present status of the 
systems of preparing teachers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. 
In looking back upon the historical development of the normal schools 
in these countries, it must be admitted that most of the criticism 
uttered was aimed at faults and deficiencies which have for the most 
part disappeared in the course of the last twenty years, but, with a view 
at our own diversified systems of normal schools, it is of interest to see 
how they have become what they are, so as to fortify the position taken. 
by all friends of popular education. Essential changes have been 
made in the normal schools of German-speaking nations, the course of 
study has been enriched, the length of the course extended; more rigid 
requirements for admission as regards the quantity of knowledge and a 
later age for admission have been fixed; new branches of study have been 
introduced, suitable buildings erected, and the means of rational instruc- 
tion, such as inuseums, laboratories, libraries, ete., have been increased. 
or improved; above all, the practice or experimental school has been 
generally accepted as an essential requisite of the normal school. 
All this has raised the normal school in central Europe to a degree of 
perfection never known before.
-P-A-G-E-180
    152 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Much of the criticism uttered in years past, and even now, is owing ~ 
to the fact that the normal schools have always been, and will forever 
be, subjected to the minute inspection and careful observation of the 
- authorities and the people. “Hewho builds on the roadside has many 
critics,” and no school is so open and comes in such close contact with 
the people as the normal school. The task of normal schools to train 
young men and women for the purpose of teaching is most difficult, as 
they are often poorly prepared, and it is especially difficult, as it has to 
be done in a comparatively short time. As regards the extent of knowl- 
edge and skill to be acquired, it may safely be said that they are greater 
than any other secondary and superior school would attempt to offer 
during the same period. And then we must consider that the gradu- 
ates of normal schools enter at once into positions in which every 
misstep in their official capacity, every faux pas in their moral conduct, 
is subjected to public criticism, because the consequences may be most 
harmful. Such things happen while the candidates are still young, 
seareely twenty years old, an age at which candidates of medicine, 
law, and theology, or other professions are still students, or are serving a 
probationary term of practical work without responsibility save such 
as may be imposed by superior officers. The normal schools influence 
the life of the people more directly than other schools do. They are 
the leaven of the lower schools, and reforms in the lower schools neces- 
sarily emanate from them; hence they are apt to wound deep-seated 
prejudices, and disturb time-honored modes of procedure. Dr. Kehr, 
of Gotha and Halberstadt (see page 148), says that the normal school, 
of all the many kinds of schools in existence, is the least known and 
often the most misjudged. Complaints concerning faulty or insufficient 
professional training come very frequently from former normal-school 
students, and from the most aspiring ones at that, from men who had 
high ideals and who have failed to realize them. In these plaints of dis- 
satisfaction others chime in, men of more pretense than talent, simply 
because in our age of absolute publicity it has become one of the char- 
acteristics of the public man to criticise existing institutions. 
Howeyer, the fight against the normal schools in central Europe is 
part and parcel of a greater question. Itis the dissatisfaction which the 
people feel in being obliged to select a profession for their boys before 
they can in any way have showed predilections or special talents. The 
gymnasium, the vestibule of the university for the learned professions; 
the Realschule or Realgymnasium, intended to prepare for other liberal 
professions; the industrial schools, aiming at preparing skilled labor; 
the normal schools for teachers, all presuppose an early decision with 
regard to the choice of a future occupation or profession. Hence the 
efforts at inducing the governments in central Europe to establish a 
common elementary and secondary school system, which would not 
require a differentiation until a later age than is now fixed, say the fif- 
teenth or sixteenth year. The prevailing caste distinctions will, how- 
ever, prevent this for some time, until the leveling influence of universal 
‘
-P-A-G-E-181
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 153 
franchise and other influences have sufficiently prepared the soil for a 
common school. There will always be a need for different professional 
schools, but it is thought that a common basis of elementary and second- 
ary education could be found for all or nearly all of them. 
IL—STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS IN GERMANY, AUSTRIA, HUN- 
GARY, AND SWITZERLAND. 
  A. Germany, being a confederation of states, has no imperial schools 
except military and naval schools. Each state manages its own schools, 
hence we are obliged to treat each state separately in this chapter. 
Prussia had, in 1891, 120 state normal schools, 112 of which were for 
men, 8 for women. These state schools have an average of 90 to 100 
students, about 30 graduates per year, and 7 or 8 professors or instruct- 
ors each. Their course of study is one of three years, except in 7, 
in which it is four years. The state paid in 1892~93 for their mainte- 
nance the sum of 5,841,823 marks, or $1,390,354, of which $664,324 is 
paid for salaries, $526,626 for boarding the students, and $200,404 for 
incidentals. The foregoing sums do not include cost of erecting new 
buildings. The cost per capita is $150, which is paid by the state. 
Beside these state institutions there are 65 private normal schools, 
chiefly for female and for Jewish teachers, but no statistics concerning 
them are available. The state maintains 35 preparatory schools in 
which the students are prepared for admission to the normal schools. 
There are 20 private schools of that kind. This is not the sum total of 
the efforts in behalf of teachers’ training, for the state subsidizes a 
number of secondary schools in which university graduates may acquire 
technical skill in teaching, and also a few university seminaries; but 
since these institutions are designed to prepare secondary teachers, we 
_mnay leave them out of consideration, and confine ourselves to normal 
schools for elementary teachers. 
Bavaria had 14 state normal schools in 1891, of which 11 were for 
men, 3 for women. Ten of the schools had a two-years’ course, 4 a five- 
years’ course. The first 10 get their students from preparatory schools, 
31 in number, specially established to prepare their graduates for admis- 
sion to the normal schools. These preparatory schools have a three- 
years’ course. The Bavarian normal schools have an average of 11 
professors, 90 to 100 students, 35 graduates per year each. The cost of 
maintenance varies slightly between 40,000 and 70,000 marks ($10,000 
to $17,500). There are beside the aforementioned state schools several 
private institutions for the training of teachers connected with second- 
ary schools, but no detailed statistics are available. 
Saxony had 15 state and 5 private normal schools, 18 for men, 2 for 
women. All have a six-years’ course, which includes preparatory work 
of three years. These normal schools have an average of 130 students 
and 12 to 14 professors and instructors. The average cost of main- 
tenance is 56,000 marks ($14,000) each. 
   
-P-A-G-E-182
  154 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Wiirtemberg had 7 state and 2 private normal schools, 6 for men 
and 3 for women. They all have a three-years’ course, about 80 stu- 
dents and 10 professors each, and their cost of maintenance amounts 
to about 40,000 marks ($10,000) each. Wiirtemberg maintains 4 pre- 
paratory schools, which, however, do not furnish all the students 
admitted to the normal schools. Other students come from classical 
and modern secondary schools. 
Baden had 5 normal schools, each having a three-years’ course, with 
an average attendance of 100 students, 10 professors, and 30 gradu- 
ates per year each. One preparatory school prepares students for 
admission to the normal schools. Other students prefer to obtain 
their preparation in secondary schools. 
Hessia had 4 normal schools, 1 of which is for women. They have a 
three-years’ course, and about the same number of students and pro- 
fessors as found in Prussian, Bavarian, and other normal schools. 
Mecklenburg-Schwerin had 2 normal schools for men. 
Mecklenburg-Strelitz had 1 normal school for men. 
Thuringia.—The 12 principalities commonly called the Thuringian 
states had 17 normal schools, 14 of which were for men, 3 for women. 
Oldenburg had 2 normal schools. 
Brunswick had 4 normal schools, 2 for men, 2 for women. 
Lubeck (free city) has no normal school, but draws its supply of 
teachers from other states of the Empire. 
Bremen (free city) had 3 normal schools, 1 for men and 2 for women. 
Hamburg (free city) had 3 normal schools, 1 for men and 2 for 
women. 
Alsace-Lorraine had 9 normal schools, 6 for men and 3 for women; 
also 2 private normal schools and 4 preparatory schools. 
B. Austria in 1891 had 70 state normal schools, 42 of which were 
for men, 28 for women. They had 993 professors and 9,854 students, 
with 2,128 graduates in 1891. Forty of the Austrian normal schools 
were German, 12 Bohemian, 6 Polish, 2 Italian, 2 Servian, and 8 mixed. 
The course of study in the Austrian normal schools is one of four 
years. For admission a preparation is required, such as a four years’ 
attendance in a secondary school secures. Few of the Austrian 
normal schools have preparatory classes. The state subsidies for 
normal schools amounted to only 82,700 florins, or $29,524; the pro- 
. vincial governments (those of the separate crownlands) pay the bulk 
of the expenses. ¥ 
O. Hungary in 1891 had 25 state (18 for women and 7 for men) and 
47 parochial normal schools (37 for men and 10 for women), These 72 
institutions had 4,346 students and 709 professors. Fifty-eight of these 
normal schools were Hungarian, 5 German, 4 Roumanian, 1 Servian, 4 
mixed. The law prescribes a three-years’ course for them, but the 
minister of education has decreed the establishment of a post-graduate 
course which is made obligatory in most of these normal schools. In
-P-A-G-E-183
  
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 155 
34 parochial schools the course is also one of four years; in 13 it is 
shorter. The number of graduates in 1891 was 1,093 and the expendi- 
tures 894,478 florins, or $319,328. 
D. Switzerland had 37 normal schools, 23 for men, 13 for women, 1 
for both sexes; 22 are German, 13 French, and 2 Italian; 25 of these 
37 schools are state institutions maintained by the cantons, 4 are city, 
and 8 private schools. In 1890 the number of students was 2,002, 
taught by 358 professors. The entire cost of maintenance was 1,119,000 
francs, or $215,967. The course of study is one of four years. Some 
of these schools get their students from secondary schools, but most of 
them from special preparatory schools. 
SUMMARY OF STATISTICS AND COMPARISONS, ~ 
Germany has 283 normal schools, 200 for men, 83 for women. Of 
these 283 institutions, 202 are state schools, 81 are private but under 
state supervision. The aggregate number of students can not be 
stated with accuracy, but a judicious estimate places it at 18,860 in 
public and 4,600 in private institutions, a total of 23,460 students. 
Austria has 70 normal schools, 42 for men, 28 for women, all state 
institutions, with 9,854 students. 
Hungary has 25 public (18 for men, 7 for women) and 47 parochial 
normal schools (37 for men, 10 for women), a total of 72 normal schools, 
with 4,346 students. 
Switzerland has 37 normal schools (state, city, and private), 23 of 
which are for men, 13 for women, and 1 mixed, with a total of 2,002 
students. 
Germany has one normal school student to every 2,110 inhabitants. 
Austria one to every 2,425, Hungary one to every 4,018, and Switzer- 
land one to every 1,457 inhabitants. 
In the United States we find the sum total of students in normal 
schools (public and private), that is, in all institutions which offer, or 
lay claims to offering, professional training of teachers, to be 34,484 
(in 1890), or one student to every 1,816 inhabitants. While this would 
seem a good showing, another comparison makes the United States 
appear in a less favorable light. 
Germany has about 112,000 teachers in elementary schools and 23,460 
normal-school students, which is about equal to 1 student to every 5 
teachers. The United States has 363,935 teachers in common schools 
and 34,484 normal-school students, which is 1 student to every 10 
teachers. Now, if we would eliminate from the total number of students 
in this country all who attend normal schools only for the purpose of 
getting a secondary education, and never acquire or desire a teacher’s 
professional training, the ratio might safely be put at 1 to 20. But that 
is mere guesswork. If, however, we consider the other fact, that almost 
all normal schools in Germany have a full three years’ course and com- 
pare with that the normal schools of the United States (some of which    
-P-A-G-E-184
    156 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
have a one year’s course), we find a greater difference than appears on 
the surface. 
The foregoing induces us to still further comparisons. Assuming 
that Germany is, as regards professional training of teachers, a nor- 
mal state well adapted to be used as a basis for comparison, let us 
see what proportion of the number of teachers have normal-school or 
professional training. It would be unfair, though, to compare our 
whole country with central Hurope, because the conditions in the West 
and South are still in a transitory state of development. New Eng- 
land, however, claims to be at the head of educational affairs of this 
country. Mr. G. A. Walton, agent of the board of education in Mas- 
sachusetts, says : 
New England employs 30,000 teachers. Of these, 6,623 have attended normal 
schools and about 2,352 have had some training and practice in city training schools 
or classes; the latter item we estimate from somewhat imperfect data. Thus 30 
per cent haye had some training and practice before assuming the entire care of a 
school. Some of the others have had the advantage of special instruction while 
attending academies and high schools. The first-named class of instruction may 
be termed professional ; the second, useful; the third, somewhat better than nothing. 
Thirty per cent, then, is the proportion in New England. In Ger- 
many it is 100 per cent, in Switzerland 100 per cent, in Austria 95 
per cent, in Hungary 88 per cent. (See diagram:)

  Another side of the question is this: Germany has about 112,000 
teachers and about 23,500 students in normal schools, or about 20 per 
cent. Of these, about a little less than 30 per cent, or 7,000, graduate 
annually; and since these graduates are assigned or appointed to posi- 
tions as soon as they graduate, that number may be taken as the num- 
ber of new teachers needed every year. In other words, it expresses 
the number of changes occurring in teachers’ positions, owing to death, 
resignation, or removal for cause, and also the annual increase caused. 
by opening new schools. 
Some interesting items.—Later official publications from Germany (of 
1892) concerning the state normal schools of Prussia only, contain a 
few additional items of information that will be found worthy of atten- 
tion. Prussia had 121 state normal schools in 1892, of which 20 were 
located in towns of less than 2,000inhabitants, 17 in towns of more than 
2,000 and less than 5,000; 36 in towns of more than 5,000 and less than 
10,000; 13 in cities between 10,000 and 20,000; 2 in cities between 20,- 
000 and 30,000, and 13 in cities over 30,000.

  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. : OY 
In regard to the religious confessions these schools are classified as 
follows: 77 are Protestant, 40 Catholic, and 4 mixed schools. 
Ten of the state normal schools of Prussia are for women, 111 for men. 
Coeducation is not recognized in any secondary or higher institution of 
learning in Prussia. 
The corps of teachers employed in these normal schools consisted of 
121 principals (directors), 120 head teachers (Hauptlehrer), 470 teachers, 
128 assistants, and 31 women teachers. 
The Prussian Diet has recently fixed their salaries as follows: Prin- 
cipals of normal schools receive from $960 to $1,296 per annum, the 
maximum to be reached after 16 years of service; increase of $90 every 
4 years. Head teachers receive from $720 to $960, the maximum to be 
reached in 12 years; increase of $60 every 3 years. Teachers receive 
from $432 to $768, the maximum to be reached in 24 years; increase of 
$48 every 3 years. Assistant teachers receive from $288 to $432, the 
maximum to be reached in 9 years, increase of $48 every three years. 
These salaries are for provincial schools only; for the normal schools 
in cities, and particularly for those in the capital, the salaries are much 
higher. : 
To all the amounts stated should be added an average of 20 per cent 
for rent, since these teachers either live in the school buildings or 
receive commutation for rent in form of cash. If we further considet 
that the purchasing power of money is greater in Germany than in 
America we conclude that the salaries are not materally different from 
those paid in this country. 
IIIl.—RULES AND REGULATIONS OF PRUSSIAN NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
I. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION. DECREE ISSUED OCTOBER 15, 1872. 
The following rules were issued by Dr. Falk, minister of education, 
worship, and medical affairs, in 1872: 
Section 1. In every State normal school.an examination for admission shall be 
held annually, some time previous to the beginning of the new term. The date is 
to be fixed by the provincial school council and published in the provincial official 
Government organ. 
Sxc. 2. Admitted to this examination are all candidates who can prove by docu- 
mentary evidence, that they are of the required age, of moral character, in good 
health and in the possession of sufficient means for support during the course of 
attendance in the normal school. It is immaterial where the candidate has acquired 
his preparatory training, whether in higher elementary, intermediate, or secondary 
schools, or in special normal preparatory schools. 
Sec. 3. Application for admission to this examination must be made to the prin- 
cipal of the normal school at least three weeks before the date fixed for the exami- 
nation, and the application must be accompanied by the required documents (see 
Sec. 4). The principal examines the documents to see whether the legal require- 
ments are met, and decides whether a candidate is to be admitted to the examina- 
tion. Any candidate who has failed three times in examination for admission is to 
be rejected. 
Src. 4. The application must be accompanied by a certificate of baptism, one of 
vaccination and revaccination, also by a certificate of good health, signed by a phy-  
-P-A-G-E-186
158 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  sician intrusted with the official seal. Candidates coming from other schools must 
furnish a written report concerning their conduct; others a certificate of good con- 
duct signed by the mayor of the place in which they live. Lastly, a declaration of 
the father or guardian to the effect that the means for support during the course 
of attendance in the normal school, are at the disposal of the candidate. This dec- 
laration must be verified officially by the administrative office of the place in which 
the candidates reside. Candidates must have completed their seventeenth year of 
life, and not have passed their twenty-fourth; but admission may be granted to older 
candidates, by the provincial school council, if objections can not be raised to their 
personality or previous condition of life. 
Src. 5. Candidates who have been found intellectually qualified for admission to a 
normal school are subjected to a medical examination conducted by the institute 
physician, whose decision is final. 
Sec. 6. The scholastic examination for admission is conducted by the faculty of 
the normal school as a board over which a provincial school councillor presides. 
School inspectors and instructors in preparatory schools are permitted to be present. 
Sec. 7. The examination is partly oral and partly written. The written part con- 
sists of an essay on a subject taken from the candidate’s own horizon of observation, 
and answers to questions in the various subjects of study. The questions shall 
be so framed as to require no more than two or three minutes to answer them in 
writing. The examiners are empowered to exclude from further examination all 
whose immaturity is clearly proven by their written work. The oral examination 
extends over all obligatory subjects of study in the normal school with the exception 
of pedagogy. Each member of the faculty examines the candidates in the subjects 
which he teaches, but it is advisable to conduct the examination in the presence of 
the entire board of examiners. If this be impracticable, it is suggested to divide 
the candidates into as many groups as there are examiners; butin cases where:a dif- 
ference of opinion prevails concerning the intellectual maturity of any candidate he 
is to be examined before the whole board in subjects that gave rise to the difference 
of opinion. 
Sec. 8. In éstimating the results in religion, language, arithmetic and mathematics, 
music, natural history and science, geography and history, the different grades or 
marks are to be united into one statement or word, such as good, very good, ete. 
Candidates who have been marked inefficient are to be rejected, unless it is rea- 
sonable to suppose that they are weak in only one or two branches and may with 
proper care and diligence make up the deficiency. If insufficient results in music 
are caused by want of musical ear, it shall not debar the candidate from admission, 
ner shall want of musical training in playing the organ prove a hindrance to 
admission. 
Src. 9. The examination for admission shall disclose whether the candidate has 
.the knowledge prescribed in the following paragraphs: 
(A) Religion.—For Protestants, an acquaintance with the sacred history of the 
Old and New Testaments, including the geography necessary for its comprehension, 
The candidate must be able to narrate the best known biblical stories in the language 
of Luther’s Bible, and be able to give information concerning their religious and 
moral contents. The catechism used in the normal school, together with explana- 
tions of terms and contents, must be known, especially the importance of certain 
expressions. He must also be able to give biblical references to the commandments, 
the articles of faith and the Lord’s Prayer; must have memorized suitable stanzas of 
hymns, and give analogous examples from biblical history. He must be familiar 
with the various books of Holy Writ, and very well acquainted with Genesis, the 
Psalms, the four Gospels, and the Acts. He must be acquainted with the main facts 
of the history of the Reformation, and have memorized about twenty hymns, which 
he is expected to recite with good expression, and must give some account of their 
authors. 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 150 
For Catholics, the candidate must be able to narrate the sacred facts of the Old 
and the New Testaments in the form presented by a good biblical school history, must 
have knowledge of biblical geography necessary for the comprehension of the 
sacred history, have some practice in finding the truths of faith and moral princi- 
ples contained in the narrations, and must know the number, divisions, and chief 
contents of the Holy Books. The diocesan catechism must have been memorized, 
and a comprehension of both terms and contents must be proved by repetition of 
the various thoughts in the candidates’ own words. He must have memorized 
twenty hymns, the contents of which he must understand thoroughly and recite 
with good emphasis. He is expected to be familiar with the lives and works of the 
most important saints of the church and the diocese, as well as with the prayers 
prescribed for Catholic Christians. 
(B) German Language.—Knowledge of etymology and syntax, also of derivatives 
and compounds. Grammatical rules must be proved and exemplified by means of 
proverbs or model sentences from the writings of German poets and popular authors, 
Candidates must be able to read correctly as to enunciation and emphasis without 
previous preparation, and be able to give an account of that which is read. They 
must be able to determine to what parts of speech words belong, to determine the 
class and kind of sentences, and be able to analyze sentences. They must have 
become familiar with the most important kinds of poetry by studying the German 
classics, and must have memorized a few epic poems of Schiller, Uhland, Riickert, 
and understand them, recite them with expression, and give an account of their 
contents. They must be able to write correctly, that is, without errors in spelling 
and grammar, and make a composition on a subject lying within their circle of 
observation and experience. 
(C) Arithmetic.—Sxill in mental arithmetic, familiarity with approved methods 
of written arithmetic. Matter: The four fundamental rules with abstract and 
denominate numbers, with whole numbers, common and decimal fractions, simple 
proportion and the common business rules, including equation of payments and 
alligation. Elementary solution of algebraic problems: The candidate must show 
- ability for independent, correct, and quick solution of problems, and prove that he 
has an insight into the reasons for his method of procedure. 
(D) Geometry.—Elements of planimetry and mensuration. 
(2) Geography.—General acquaintance with the continents and oceans, more 
minutely with the geography of Europe, and thorough acquaintance with that of 
Germany ; the fundamental principles of mathematical geography, commonly called 
elementary astronomy. 
(F) History.—Chief events of ancient history (such as the Trojan war, the Per- 
sian wars, the golden era of Greece, Alexander the Great, foundation of Rome, the 
kings, the expulsion of Tarquin, Camillus, the Gauls, the Punic wars, and other 
events), the origin and spread of Christianity, the great migrations, familiarity 
with the chief personages and events of the German and the Brandenburg-Prussian 
history to the present time. A comprehension of the causal nexus in history should 
not be expected, neither a complete knowledge of historical dates; it is sufficient 
when the candidate has learned history from good biographies, but it is absolutely 
required of him to be sure of his knowledge and of his dates. 
(G) Natural history and science.—The natural history of the three kingdoms must 
have been studied in their types and families; acquaintance with important agricul- 
tural plants, poisonous plants, and with fauna and flora of his native place is 
required. In physics he must have studied the most important principles, and of 
chemistry, the bare elements will suffice. It is most desirable that the candidate 
have acquired scientific truths by experimenting in the laboratory. 
(H) Cailigraphy.—Skill in rapid penmanship and in writing with crayon on the 
blackboard. In all his writing he must show legible, clean, and elegant penman- 
ship. 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  160 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
(1) Drawing: Freehand and mechanical drawing; some exercise in rapid sketch- 
ing, and drawing on the blackboard. 
(K) Music.—The candidate must be able to sing twenty of the.most familiar 
hymns and popular airs. The singing must be free of gross errors in intonation, 
measure, accent, and expression. Likewise he must possess some skill in reading 
music, such as easy hymns or melodies. On the piano he must have well studied 
the scales in major and minor, be able to execute some studies and sonatas, likewise 
read music, that is, easy pieces on the piano. On the violin the candidate must be 
able to play the most important major and minor scales in slow tempo, but in good 
tone and in the first position of the hand; he must be able to play on the violin any 
hymn or popular air which he can sing from memory; likewise read music, that is, 
execute melodies fairly well which he has not played before. Correct knowledge of 
the principles of the technique of instrumental music should be duly required. Of 
the theory of music it is snfficient for him to know the different signs, measures, 
and scales; the common technical terms, the theory of intervals, and the relation of 
scales. In harmony the candidate must be able to name and play the major and 
minor triad as well as the seventh chord in any key and render its relations to other 
chords. On the organ the candidate must have played elementary manual and 
pedal exercises; be able to play at sight a four-part hymn and easy compositions 
from memory. 
(L) Gymnastics.—The candidate is required to perform all the exercises contained 
in the new guide for gymnastics in the Prussian peoples’ schools. 
These regulations were issued in 1872 by the then minister of public 
instruction, Dr. Falk, and they have not been changed since. Follow- 
ing we give an account of the course of study in the normal school 
itself; after that we shall see what the requirements for admission are 
in other States of the Empire. 
In the Kingdom of Saxony the normal schools have a course of six 
years—three for preparatory and three for professional study. The 
students are admitted at the completion of the fourteenth year of age 
with an education such as a good elementary school offers to pupils 
between the ages of 6 and 14, but in addition to that the rudiments 
of the French (or the English) language are required. The result 
of an examination—not a diploma or a certificate—determines the 
admission. 
  2, PRESENT MANAGEMENT OF PRUSSIAN NORMAL SCHOOLS AND COURSE OF STUDY. 
Management. 
SEcrion 1. Every State normal school must haye one graded and one ungraded 
practice school in organic connection with it, to be used as experimental schools. 
Src. 2. The work of these practice schools is to be carried on, under supervision 
of the normal school principal, by a special class teacher who is to be one of the 
faculty of the normal school. 
Src. 3. The course of study of the normal school is of three years. 
Src. 4. It must be the aim of the first year’s work to promote uniformity in the 
students’ accomplishments, coming as they do from various preparatory and second- 
ary schools. The students should be taught to arrange their knowledge logically; 
to supplement it and learn to reproduce and apply it independently. During the 
first year of the course the normal students are not brought into contact with the 
work in the practice school. During the second year, the students receive those 
additions to their academic knowledge which are necessary for their future yoca-
-P-A-G-E-189
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 16] 
  tion; but all new knowledge offered is to be rendered in a manner that will aid its 
veproduction and application in teaching. In the practice school, the students of 
this grade merely listen and make notes during lessons given by the members of the 
faculty, but may be called upon to aid in keeping order during récess, and give les- 
sons occasionally. During the senior year the academic studies are completed in 
such a manner that constant reference to sources of information will enable the 
graduates to continue their studies alone. In the practice school the seniors share 
the practical work with the members of the faculty, and try to cover the whole 
ground of the elementary course by giving lessons in every branch of study. _ 
No senior student shall teach less than 6 or more than 10 hours per week in the 
practice school, and no one may graduate who has not had the requisite practice in 
teaching religion, grammar, arithmetic, singing, and in one of the other branches 
prescribed. Hence a change of daily programme is to be made at least three times 
during the year. At the close of such terms (determined by a change in the pro- 
gramme) a practical examination in teaching is to:be held for those seniors who have 
completed their part of the work. This examination is attended by the students, 
in the capacity of visitors, who have been designated as the successors of those 
examined. : s 
Sec. 5. The academic work done is carefully recorded in the journal of progress, 
which record serves as a guide in examinations at the close of the term and year. 
All annual examinations are conducted by the faculty and extend over all the 
branches of the course. 
Src. 6. At the close of a year’s work all the members are promoted to the next 
higher course. If any student fails in annual examination, the faculty moves his 
dismissal, and the provincial school council acts upon the recommendation. Per- 
mission to repeat the year’s course is given only when the deficiency was caused by 
severe and protracted illness. 
Sec. 7. The two lower grades have each twenty-four hours’ and the third four- 
teen hours’ acadeniic instruction each week, exclusive of the several technical and 
optional studies, such as music, drawing, calligraphy, gymnastics, laboratory work, 
foreign languages, and the like. 
Src. 8. The study of all branches of the elementary school course and of peda- 
gogy is obligatory. The extent to which students may be excused from instruction 
in organ-playing depends partly upon the degree of proficiency acquired prior to 
admission, partly upon local circumstances, but cach case must be decided by the 
faculty in a body. 
Src. 9. French, English, and Latin are optional studies. Students who have never 
studied any of these languages prior to their admission to the normal school shall 
not be allowed to take up studies in foreign languages unless they show that they 
possess exceptional linguistic talent. French is to be given the preference. 
Src. 10. The instruction given to normal students shall be in its form a model of 
that which the teacher himself afterward is expected to give. He is to consider, 
equally, correctness on the part of the teacher in offering new material and oral as 
well as written reproduction on the part of the pupil. 
Dictating and writing from dictation during lectures are strictly prohibited. Each 
branch of study, however, should be represented by a brief sketch in form of a guide 
as a text-book. 
All instruction given should offer the method together with the subject matter, and 
should lead toward independent treatment. The students should be exercised in 
continuous speech and free delivery not only in language lessons, but in every lesson. 
Src. 11. In order to promote instruction and study, cach normal school must have 
a good library, a laboratory for study in physics, where possible one for chemistry, 
and a practical collection of approved objects for objective teaching. 
Sec. 12. Where the separate institution of a students’ library, though it be but. 
a section of the general school library, is impracticable, it should be the aim of the 
ED 92. 11  
-P-A-G-E-190
162 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  faculty to pay attention to the literary needs of the students in the purchase of new 
books. The new acquisitions should be selected with a view to offering the students 
suitable matter for entertainment as well as proper supplement and aids to instruc- 
tion; but, above all, model or classic representation is tobe aimed at. To this class of 
books may be counted the complete works of our classical poets; also the most noted 
poets and popular authors of modern time, so far as they are comprehensible to the 
students; always provided they promote the educational object of the institution. 
* There should also be books on the history of education; that is to say, beside the 
most noted works of great pedagogues of the last three centuries, as found in collec- 
tions such as The Pedagogical Library of Karl Richter, models of good juvenile 
books, beginning with the first efforts during the time of the philanthropists. The 
students’ library should also contain models of popular representation of the world’s 
and home geography, universal history, and the history of civilization; also the 
writings of Schleiden, Tschudi, Masius, Brehm, Werner Hahn, Ferd. Schmidt, 
Wildenhahn, W. Baur, Gustav Freitag, Riehl, and collections like Grubes, ete. 
Sxc. 13. The-use of books for private reading on the part of the students must be 
regulated and controlled during lessons. It must be so arranged that the students 
have the choice between books of like character, and only the reading of such works 
should bé made obligatory the use of which appears necessary, such as Lessing’s 
Minna von Barnhelm, Schiller’s Wallenstein, Goethe’s Hermann and Dorothea, Pes- 
talozzi’s Lienhard and Gertrud. = 
Sec. 14, The students must be given opportunities for private association, such as 
mutual reading hours, musical entertainments, botanical excursions for the purpose 
of cultivating a desire for higher studies. 
Suc. 15. At least once a month allinstruction must be suspended for an entire day. 
The time thus gained is to be employed in independent occupations, and no school 
exercises shall encumber the freedom of the day. 
Sec. 16. In making out the daily programme care must be taken that the student’s 
owninstruction is not in any way abridged by his occupation in the practice school; 
hence the academic instruction in the senior class must be arranged so that it will 
not interfere with the time devoted to practical teaching in the practice school; in 
the junior class some of the lessons should be given after school hours in the practice 
school. (Note.—Many practice schools in these training colleges have only one ses- 
sion, from 8 a. m. till 1 p. m.) 
Sec. 17, The instruction in normal schools must follow a course of study the details 
of which are to be determined upon by the faculty, but the course is subject to the 
approyal of the minister of education. He also sanctions or rejects the selection of 
text-books. As*far as the local cireumstances of the institution will permit, the 
course of study must embrace the following subjects and be based upon the prin- 
ciples hereafter set forth: 
3. COURSE OF STUDY. 
Pedagogy. 
Src. 18. Grade first.—Two hours per week. The essentials of the history of educa- 
tion and instruction in- vivid pictures of the most noted reformers, the great 
educational epochs, the most interesting and successful improvements in public 
education. To supplement these summaries the chief works of pedagogical litera- 
ture since the great church reformation are to be used as books of reference. The 
selection of these books is to be guided by the topics discussed in class, and the 
work should be so treated that the student must comprehend the character and 
contents of the entire works. 
Grade second.—Two hours per week. A general theory of education and instrue- 
tion, with the essential parts of logic and psychology. (a) The matter of instruction. 
(0) The form of instruction. (¢) Training (or education through instruction).
-P-A-G-E-191
  
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 163 
Grade third.—Five hours per week. Special theories of education and instruction. 
Methods of instruction. The office of the teacher. Management and organization of 
school. Supplementary work of the teacher. Outside duties. The students to be 
made acquainted with governmental regulations. One hour is to be used by the 
principal of the practice school for discussion. of the practical work of the students 
and an exchange of observation and criticism. 
Religion. 
Sec. 19. Grade first.—Four hours. Biblical history of the Old Testament. The 
different biblical stories are to be developed and made useful from a religious and a 
moral standpoint, and the students be trained in narrating these stories in proper 
language and style. Psalms and other poetical portions of the Old Testament. The 
church hymn and its development. The hymns prescribed by the course of study 
should be treated in form and contents and in chronological order, thus illustrating 
the history of church poetry. Memorizing hymns is prescribed only for grades 
first and second. S 
Grade second.—Four hours. Biblical history of the New Testament with special 
reference to the gospels and selections from the epistles of the apostles. Explana- 
tion of the church calendar and the arrangement of divine service. The catechisms 
of the respective confessions, witli tonstant feference to biblical history and sug- 
gestions for the practical treatment of the matter in school. During the second 
part of the year at least one hour a week must be applied to model or trial lessons 
in the practice school. 
Grade third.—Two hours. Knowledge of the Bible (in Protestant normal schools 
reading of the Bible, to wit, the Acts, the epistles of St. Paul, the book of Job, and 
portions of Isaiah), The essentials of church history. The method of religious 
instruction is to be shown by test lessons that illustrate all the various forms; that 
is, biblical history, application of biblical references, study of the gospels, cate- 
chism, hynms, and church history. Suggestions for the further study of the subject. 
The religious text-books, such as catechism and school Bible, should be readin such 
a manner that the student may afterward use and explain them independently, but 
the instruction should by no means be confined to the limits drawn by these books; 
hence the application and frequent use of other similar books is strongly recom- 
mended. The course of study for Catholic normal schools should contain also 
memorizing and explanation of prayers, the use of which the church declares a 
religious duty. 
terman language. 
Src. 20. Grade first.—Five hours. (a) Grammar: simple, compound, and complex 
sentences in easy combinations. The parts of speech, declension, comparison, con- 
jugation. Rules of orthography and punctuation. (6) Reading: in connection with 
exercises in oral expression and written composition, source of information concern- 
ing the essence and form of poetry; the elements of metric, the most important 
facts concerningrhyme. Kinds of poetry: lyric poetry, the song, epic poetry, poetic 
narration, legends, sagas, fairy stories, ballads; didactic poetry, fable, and parable. 
Grade second.—Vive hours. (a) Grammar: more minute knowledge of complex 
and abbreviated sentences; etymology, the rection of verbs, adjectives, and prepo- 
sitions; formation of words and punctuation. (b) Reading asin first grade. Poetry 
and prose selected for reading should be more difficult in extent, form, and con- 
tents than those treated in grade first. Lyric, epic, and dramatic poetry in general, 
popular airs, ode, ballad, romance, epos, and drama. (c) Rhetoric and practical 
instruction in language lessons and model lessons in the schoolroom. 
Grade third.—Two hours. Review of the course in grades first and second; 
extension of the course of reading. Methods of language instruction in connection 
with trial lessons.

  164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
‘The following principles are to be considered in teaching language:» (a) Tluent 
and correct speech is to be a matter of supreme importance; it is, however, not to be 
attained by memorizing and reciting certain prose pieces, but by inducing the students 
in every lesson, especially in language lessons, to express théir thoughts in complete 
and connected sentences. (b) With regard to compositions, correctness of form, 
clearness of expression, distinct arrangement of matter, should be demanded. The 
aim of this branch is always to enable the student to express, comprehensively, 
any matter that he thoroughly understands. The tasks set for the different classes 
should be well graded, and the subjects treated taken from all the various branches 
ofstudy. (c) The reading of the students should be partly private, partly public, 
in class. For private reading, books from the school library are to be chosen. It 
should comprehend chiefly the master-works of German poets and prose writers, 
past and present. Especially gifted students may be furnished more plentifully 
than others. Matter read in class is to be explained with regard to form and con- 
tents. Poetry and prose are to be chosen from the different eras of German 
literature since Luther, especially the classics. The selection must be made so that 
the peculiarities of the various writers, and the different aspects of the language are 
illustrated. A number of the poems thus explained are to be memorized. The 
readers prescribed for the practice school of the institution should be diligently 
used; also, the matter contained in the readers used in the schools of the province 
should be worked over, and suggestions for the further acquisition of literary 
knowledge offered. Side by side with the readers of the practice school, in the 
proper use of which the students are to be instructed, the’ academic instruction in 
reading in the normal school grades is to be based upon a special reader. 
History. 
Src. 21. Grade first—Two hours. Pictures from the life of the most important

TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 165 
Grade third.—Qne hour, The greatest attention to be given to the teaching of - 
arithmetic. In algebra, equations are continued and logarithms taught. Sugges- ‘ 
tions for independent study. Aim: Comprehension of the method, accuracy in solu- 
tion, and independence of thought and action at all times. 
Geometry. 
  SEc. Grade first.—Two hours. Lines, angles, triangles, parallelograms, and 
circles. Constructive geometry. 
Grade second.—Two hours. Equality and similarity of figures.” Measuring. Stere- 
ometry. 
Grade third.—Review of the entire subject and instruction in methodical treat- 
ment in the lower schools. 
In all three grades the students are exercised in the drawing of geometrical figures 
on the blackboard. The instruction starts with object teaching, and is to follow a 
text book. Aim: Clear comprehension of the subject and the method of teaching it. 
Suggestions for independent study and ability to teach the subjects successfully. 
  Natural history, physics, and chemistry. 
Sc. 24. Grade first.—Four hours. (a) Natural history. Knowledge of selected 
home plants representing the most common families. Knowledge of systems (Linné) 
and the most important parts of botanical morphology. In winter, zoology. (b) 
Physics. Mechanical, magnetic, and electric phenomena. (c) Chemistry. The sim- 
plest elements and their combinations. The mineralogical side of the subject 
(inorganic chemistry) to be treated with special attention, 
Grade second.—Four hours. (a) Natural history: Knowledge of the chief forms 
of seed and spore-plants; tho natural system; construction, life, and spread of 
plants. In winter, continuation of the work in zoology, especially anatomy and 
‘physiology of the human body. (b) Physics: The phenomena of light, heat, and 
sound. (¢c) Chemistry: Continuatton of the course in grade first, with the addition 
of organic chemistry. 
Grade third.—Two hours. A general extension of the work of the first two grades 
with particular attention to the method of instruction, in addition the elements of 
geology; suggestions for independent study. 
In all three branches of study the method of teaching is considered of supreme 
importance; hence, model lessons are to be prepared on paper and given in the class 
room, It must be the special object of this instruction to find methods for the pro- 
sentation of natural science, which would, even in the lower schools, have an educative 
influence. Hence, in every case, the instruction should start with object lessons. In 
physics and chemistry no lessons should be given without ¢xperiments, and in nat- 
ural history none without the object, or its pictorial presentation. Pure memory 
work is tobe rigorously excluded. . Aim: To enable the students to find their way 
independently through the three kingdoms of nature, to continue the study of nature, 
with the aid of good books, and to give objective instruction in natural history and 
science in the elementary school. 
Geography. 
SEC. 25. Grade first—Two hours. The essentials of home and foreign geography. 
Systematic knowledge of the earth’s surface. The continents. Reading maps. 
Grade second.—Two hours. Europe, Germany; mathematical geography. Instrue- 
tion with regard to the method of geographical teaching by means of model lessons 
on paper and trial lessons in school. 
Grade third.—One hour. Continued study of methods of teaching, especially 
those having reference to the application in school of atlases, wall maps, globes, 
tellurions, and other means and devices.

166 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-96. 
Drawing. 
Src. 26. Grade jfirst.—Two hours. Free-hand drawing: Division of lines and 
angles. Drawing of geometrical plane figures. Complex symmetrical figures within 
the square (conventionalized natural forms). Drawing of rectangular and curved 
bodies from the front. Symmetrical figures and ornaments after models. Instru-

Grade second.—Two hours. Elements of perspective. Free-hand drawing from 
wooden models and casts, also from natural objects with crayon, India ink, sepia, 
and other colors, according to the talent of the students. Exercises in blackboard 
drawing. 
Grade third.—One hour. Continued practice (especially on the blackboard) in 
drawing from nature, also objects used for illustration in other lessons. The meth- 
ods of drawing to be discussed and illustrated. Suggestion for further study. 
Aim: To enable the students to readily and accurately draw on the blackboard 
the figures necessary in the various branches of study (geometry, geography, object 
and language lessons), and to give good instruction in drawing in the lower schools. 
Penmanship. 
Src. 27. Grade first.—Two hours. 
Grade second.—One hour. Aim: (1) Students shall acquire a fluent, good penman- 
ship, and use it in all written exercises. Nonegligent writing to be allowed. (2) To 
enable the students to set a good copy, not only on paper but also on the blackboard, 
and (3) to give good, methodical instruction in penmanship in the lower schools. 
Gymnastics. 
Sec, 28. The instruction in gymnastics is to follow the new guide prescribed for 
Prussian elementury schools, but this does not prohibit considerable extension of the 
course when local circumstances will permit it. Under any circumstances the aim 
must remain—the ability of the student to give good instruction and training in 
gymnastics in the public schools according to the published guide. 
The first and second grades have each two hours per week; the third grade, one 
hour of practical gymnastics. The latter grade has, in addition, one hour for the 
necessary instruction concerning anatomy and functions of the human body. The 
first necessary aids in case of accident, historical development, aim, organization 
and management of gymnastic training, as well as the arrangement of gymnastic 
grounds and apparatus in elementary schools, 
The students of the third grade must be given opportunity under supervision of 
the teachers of gymnastics to give lessons in gymnastics in the lower schools. 
Music. 
  Src. 29. (a) Piano.—In the first grade purely technical exercises in touch and 
fluency; some études according to a well-reputed text-book; independent musical 
pieces in successive order (beginning with easy sonatas, by Clementi) of modern as 
well as classic composers. 
In the second grade études are continued; by specially gifted students Cramer’s 
work may be used; sonatas of classical composers like Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, 
and others. In grade first piano playing is reserved for Tees practice. 
(b) Church organ.—The students follow the prescribed book according to the 
measure* of their musical talent and training. Class instruction can not well be 
given except in regard toa certain number of hymns in the first grade. Analysis and 
transposition of preludes and interludes, as well as practice in reading at sight and 
preparation for the functions of an organist in church. For the third grade trans- 
position of hymns, practice in modulation, and composition of simple preludes and 
interludes.
-P-A-G-E-195
  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 167 
(c) Harmony.—Students who do not intend to prepare themselves for the position 
of organist must nevertheless take part in the instruction in harmony prescribed for 
grade first and in the historical part of the study. 
Grade first.—Position and practice of the triad in major and minor, seventh and 
ninth chords, according to their principal forms and combinations. 
Grade second.—Confirming knowledge gained in harmony, and constant applica- 
tion of the same in transcribing church hymns, and in analyzing, transposing, and 
practicing brief organ pieces. Also first course in modulation. 
Grade third.—Harmonizing hymns and popular airs. Composition of simple pre- 
ludes, composition of interludes worthy of being applied in divine service. Second 
course in modulation. The scales of the ancients. Knowledge of the most essential 
forms of instrumental music. Explanation of the construction of organ and its care. 
A little of the history of music. 
(d) Violin.—The students are not divided into annual classes, but arranged accord- 
ing to their talent and training in music. Each division is to follow the pres¢eribed 
text-book for violin playing. Besides the formal exercises found in text-books the 
following points are to be gained: (1) Simple and memorized exercises for beginners ; 
popular airs and school songs prescribed for the lower schools; (2) acceptable per- 
formance of duets in systematic arrangement; (3) introduction into the higher 
positions on the violin. 3 
(e) Singing.—Grade first in class lessons, elementary exercises in cultivating the” 
voice, and for the purposes of independent presentation of melodic, rhythmic, and 
dynamic conditions of music. Hymns and popular airs; the former of one part, the 
latter of one, two, and three parts. Besides mixed choir of combined classes; exer- 
cises in vocalization and solfeggios, a more extensive treatment of intervals, espe- 
cially of the chords in their different forms. Memorizing of popular hymns in two 
and three part music. Liturgical music: liturgicai hymns in which the students 
must be able to lead; other religious choruses, such as motets and psalms of classical 
composers; secular choruses, with particular attention to patriotic songs. 
Grade third, in a class by itself, is to receive instruction concerning the teaching 
of singing in the lower schools combined with practical exercises. Mixed choirs are 
to be combined of the students of the normal school and the pupils of the practice 
school. 
The instruction in music aims to make good singing teachers, organists, and choir 
leaders. This aim should not be lost sight of by undue training of a few students 
as virtuosos. The students should be trained in the comprehension of classical 
compositions, and thus be prevented from amateurish performances in composing. 
In grades first and second, each, five hours per week is to be devoted to music; the 
seniors have three hours. These hours are to be so divided that each of the subjects 
previously mentioned shall find a place on the daily programme. 
Src. 30. Instruction in foreign languages may be offered in three classes with 
three or two hours per week to students who desire such instruction; the lowest 
grade to begin with elementary grammar of the language studied. 
Sec. 31. Horticulture, arboriculture, culture of the silkworm shall, as hitherto, find 
attention in the normal schools of the Kingdom, and be, in a measure, supplemented 
by instruction in natural history. The institutions hitherto maintained for instruc- 
tion in horticulture and arboriculture shall be continued (school gardens and 
nurseries). 
The foregoing is the course of study in the normal schools in Prussia 
as prescribed by the Government. Of course each school has its 
own course of study framed and carried out by the faculty of that 
school, but these separate courses must be in accord with the princi- 
ples expressed in the foregoing course. In order to show what the 
detailed course of a normal school is, we insert here a small portion of

years. We choose the chapter “History and literature” to show how 
the two subjects are taught so as to supplement one another. Titles in 
parentheses are those of literary masterpieces.

IV.—PROFESSIONAL STUDY OF GERMAN TEACHERS. 
The course of study pursued in Prussian normal schools (see pp. 
162-667) shows that among the branches taught pedagogy is mentioned. 
To an American reader this term may possibly convey an erroneous 
meaning. Hence it is desirable to define it by giving a synopsis of 
the course in pedagogy prescribed. We see from it that pedagogy is 
a collective term, embracing the history, science, and practice of teach- 
ing, or, to use a more comprehensive term, education. The synopsis is 
taken from a text-book on pedagogy now in use in the majority of 
Prussian normal schools. Its title is Lehrbuch der Piidagogik, by Dr. 
W. Ostermann and L. Wegner (Osnabriick, 1891), 2 volumes.

V.—TEACHERS’ TRAINING IN SWITZERLAND, * 
Switzerland shows some special features in its system of normal 
schools which may be worthy of mention. The Year Book of C. Grob 
furnishes very well sifted material for that purpose 
‘The buildings of the Swiss normal schools are partly sequestered 
convents or ancient manor houses, partly convents and schoolhouses 
still in use and serving other purposes besides those of normal schools. 
One was formerly a hotel. Eight of these schools have large areas of 
land for the purpose of agriculture; some, a spacious park or garden 
for the practical study of botany and for recreation. 
Switzerland has 37 normal schools; of these 22 are in German, 13 in 
French, and 2 in Italian Switzerland. Twenty-three are attended 
exclusively by men, 13 by women, and 1 (since 1873 in Kiissnach) by 
both sexes. Of the 23 schools for men, 6 are independent institutions—
-P-A-G-E-201
  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 173 
that is to say, not exclusively normal schools, because the students are 
prepared in them for other pursuits also. It may be mentioned that in 
Basel the principle has been followed according to which general edu- 
eation is separated from strictly professional training. The teachers in 
Basel “must acquire a scientific education on a level with the other 
learned professions.” ‘We demand of elementary teachers,” says the 
report of the commission of public education, “as well as of teachers of 
secondary schools, that they graduate from a secondary school which 
leads up to the university. The pedagogical education is restricted to 
a seminary affiliated with the university. Its course lasts one year and 
ahalf. Owing to the necessary practical exercises in teaching, the 
purely professional training of teachers could not be entirely given over | 
to the university proper.” Since May, 1892, the council of education of 
Basel has authorized an extension of this course to two years. 
The cantons maintain 25, certain communities 4 of the Swiss normal 
schools, 8 are private. The number of students in 1890 was 2,002 
(1,294 men and 708 women). They were instructed by 288 men and 70 
women, whose salaries were comparatively low; for instance, in Ziirich 
and St. Gallen between $600 and $1,000; in Vaud between $600 and 
$800; in Thurgau between $480 and $760 (with some benefices), and 
in Berne between $400 and $600. The entire expenditure for teachers’ 
training in Switzerland in 1890 amounted to $223,800, which is $112 
per capita. 
Twenty-four Swiss normal schools offer their students the econom- 
ical advantages of dormitories. In some of these the students have to 
clean rooms and keep house, attend to the garden, serve at table, and 
to some extent also in the kitchen, split wood, and do similar domestie 
work. ‘These duties are performed to lessen the expenses of the stu- 
dents. This convent discipline is very severely commented upon in 
the educational press, but it nay be explained by the prevailing poy- 
erty in certain strata of society in Switzerland. The students are 
allowed to form societies for mutual improvement. The report referred 
to notes 9 gymnastic, 7 shorthand, 4 singing societies, and 3 for general 
purposes. This is to afford students some experience in parliamentary 
rules, a very essential element of education in a republic. With the 
exception of Basel, mentioned before, the requirement for admission is 
that the student shall have attended a grammar school, the graduates 
of which must be 15 years of age; then follows in 11 normal schools a 
course of four years, while in the remainder the course is one of three or 
two years. In the latter the minimum age for admission is sixteen years. 
The authority quoted remarks that with few exceptions, such as Ziirich 
and Basel, the normal schools offer too little in the way of intellectual 
culture and professional training. 
The lessons prescribed require 38 hours’ work, to which must’be added 
a considerable number of hours of work for optional studies, A 
revision of the course of study is frequently called for by the teachers.
-P-A-G-E-202
174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  The course of study varies in the different cantons. Instruction in lan- 
guage receives 5 to 10 hours per week. The mother tongue receives 
a larger share of time in French and Italian schools than in the 
the German, where natural sciences and the mathematical branches 
are treated more extensively. On the other hand, in German Switzer- 
land the foreign tongues are generally considered of greater importance 
than in the French and Italian schools. In all Swiss normal schools, 
with the exception of four, one other language is taught beside the 
mother tongue, as an obligatory study. In German schools it is either 
the French or Italian, in the French it is the German language. To 
geography only 2 hours are given uniformly, but as regards mathe- 
matics and natural sciences, the courses vary considerably. While in 
Ziirich these branches are considered of great importance, they are 
almost neglected in Wallis. Arithmetic and book-keeping are separate 
branches in 9 institutions, hygiene in 4, and civics in all’ the normal 
schools of western Switzerland. Civics is understood in Switzerland 
to embrace knowledge of the constitution, laws, and political economy. 
Agriculture is taught in 11, and manual training given in 7 institutions. 
The professional preparation of the common school téachers is not treated with 
the importance it deserves. The time is too short to apply, in the practice school, 
principles and methods learned in the class rooms. The students are much too 
young to comprehend and assimilate much of psychology and other branches of 
pedagogy. Nor are the teachers well enough prepared to give scientific instruction 
in pedagogy. Besides all this the opportunities for practical work in school are, in 
many institutions, insufficient. A peculiar feature of the professional part of the 
course is, that pedagogy and method are represented by two different teachers. (C. 
Grob.) 
There is a general unwritten law in Switzerland derived from experi- 
ence, that no candidate for a teacher’s position may be elected before 
he is of age (20 years). The diploma of graduation of a normal school 
is based upon the accomplishments of the students in every branch of 
study pursued during the course. Though a branch may have been 
finished during the first year, the result of the final examination in that 
branch held during the first year has its bearing upon the diploma. 
A minute study of the entire system of teachers’ training in Switzer- 
Jand will evince the fact, that the connection between the great national 
common school system of the Republic and the normal schools is not 
as organic as it might be, the general supervision being wanting. The 
teachers of the Swiss normal schools have not formed a society as have 
those of the secondary schools. There is even wanting a connection of 
the normal schools of each canton with the other advanced seats of 
learning; but if we consider the fact, that public education is not a 
federal concern, but of the different cantons or states that constitute 
the Federation as it is with us, we can easily see why it is that in school 
matters Sjvitzerland shows such a remarkable variety of objects and 
means.

TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
VI.—SYMPOSIUM, 
  Tn order to shed light on the present status of the training of teachers 
in central Europe, this chapter is inserted. It contains opihions con- 
cerning the training of teachers, expressed by normal-school men in 
reply to a circular letter submitted by the executive committee of the 
German Teachers’ Union. The gentlemen to whom the letter was 
addressed were all men of great reputation and long experience in 
normal-school work in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Of 42 
to whom the circular letter was sent, 17 replied to every one of the 
8 questions submitted. They were Dr. Andrae, inspector of normal 
schools in Kaiserslautern, Bavaria; Dr. Bliedner, principal of a 
secondary school (formerly. of a normal school), in Hisenach, Saxe- 
Weimar; Mr. Béhm, normal-school, teacher in Altdorf, Bavaria; Mr. 
Brossmann, principal of a normal-school in Schleiz, Thuringia; Dr. Han- 
nak, principal of a Piidagogium in Vienna, Austria; Mr. Helm, inspec- 
tor of normal schools in Schwabach, Bavaria; Mr. Israel, school coun- 
cilor and principal of a normal schoolin Zschoppau, Saxony; Dr. Just, 
principal of asecondary school (formerly normal-school teacher), in Alten- 
burg, Thuringia; Dr. Lange, principal of a secondary school (formerly 
normal-school teacher), in Plauen, Saxony; Mr. Leutz, principal of a 
normal school in Karlsruhe, Baden; Mr. Mahraun, superintendent of 
city schools (formerly principal of normal school), in Hamburg; Mr. 
Martig, principal of a normal school in Hofwyl, Switzerland; Dr. Rein, 
professor in the university (formerly principal of a normal school), in _ 
Jena, Thuringia; Dr. v. Sallwiirk, chief school councilor in Carlsruhe, 
Baden; Mr. Schultze, school councilor and principal of normal college, 
Potsdam, near Berlin, Prussia; Rev. Mr. Seyffarth, superintendent of 
schools in Liegnitz, Silesia, Prussia; Dr. Staude, principal normal 
school in Coburg, Thuringia; Dr. Keferstein, principal of a normal school 
in Hamburg; Dr. Wohlrabe, rector in Halle, Prussia; Prof. Rau- 
itzsch, principal normal school in Weimar, Thuringia; Mr. Schéppa, 
principal normal school in Delizsch, Prussia. 
Other gentlemen explained their failure to respond to the queries 
submitted, on account of the position they are holding, since it might 
appear as though they criticized the government. 
The first question asked was: 
Is it advisable to organize the normal schools in such a way that they can offer 
professional—that is, pedagogical—training exclusively, or should they also offer 
academic instruction and general education which must be the basis of professional 
work? 
Thirteen replies were in favor of the first, three in favor of the 
latter organization. For the principle of separation of general educa- 
cation and purely professional training, the following reasons were 
advanced : 
Without doubt the true object of a teacher’s training school is to 
prepare its students for their profession. ‘The science it has to teach
-P-A-G-E-204
176 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  is therefore pedagogy and its supplementary sciences; the art it has to 
develop is the art of teaching. The school can accomplish this task 
satisfactoriky only if the general education of its students has to a 
certain extent been completed before they are: admitted. This seems 
necessary also because without previous thorough training of the mind 
a scientific treatment of pedagogical questions, as well as pedagogical 
thinking, is impossible. If a separation between general preparation 
and professional training is made, the work in the normal school would 
be more unified, hence its effect upon mind and heart more intense. 
The mixture now prevailing is the chief obstacle to progress in the field 
of teachers’ training. It necessitates a low degree of requirements for 
the general education as wellas for special professional training, lower 
at least, than is desirable in the interest of popular education. The 
lowering of requirements of both objects will prevent doing justice to 
either, and is the chief cause of the specific type which is popularly 
styled “schoolmaster’s wisdom.” 
In the field of teachers’ training for secondary schools the State has 
recognized the imperative necessity of separating general culture and 
professional training, by requiring the former to be gained in the uni- 
versities, the latter in special seminaries connected with secondary 
schools. A similar separation in the preparation of teachers for the 
common schools would not only be beneficial for the entire system of 
training, but equally benefit the profession, since the latter would rise 
in public opinion very perceptibly. 
Of the three opponents, one bases his objection to the proposed sep- 
aration upon the fact that it presupposes two educational institutions, 
hence would greatly enhance the cost of teachers’ training. The other 
two gentlemen seem to presuppose that by the term Fachbildung or pro- 
fessional training is meant the study of the science of pedagogy and 
supplementary sciences only. If this were the case, their objection - 
would be justified, for instruction confined to those limits would scarcely - 
fill out the time or engage the interest of the student eniielouly, But 
that presupposition is erroneous. 
During the national teachers’ convention at Halle in 1892 it was 
plainly stated: 
The Fachbildung or professional training should consist in the study of the science of 
pedagogy and its supplementary sciences, together with practice in teaching and the 
complete claboration with reference to its didactic treatment and formation of the 
matter of instruction prescribed for common schools. It is true, in this practical work, 
the matter of instruction is below the level of the student, but it is treated from a 
different point of view so that the dominating interest is enlisted and strongly 
expressed. Beside these studies a few branches of study for general culture must 
find a place in the curriculum of the professional normal school, such as history of 
civilization, literature, foreign languages, ete. However, they must be so taught that 
they become serviceable to the professional training. In the history of culture and 
civilization, for instance, the development of education and school systems must 
come in for a good share of attention; the treatment of literary masterpieces must 
emphasize their psychological and pedagogical importance; the reading of works in 
foreign languages must chiefly touch upon educational questions, etc. From this it
-P-A-G-E-205
  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 177 
is plain that though the professional instruction in the normal school (by subjecting 
it to the pedagogical interest) maintains its unity of character and purpose, yet it 
acts suggestively and fructifying upon all parts of the student's horizon of thought. 
The author of the seventeenth reply holds a singular point of view. 
He desires a university education for all teachers, elementary as well 
as secondary, with the exception of special teachers of music and 
organists, as well as teachers of ungraded schools who are obliged 
_to teach music also. This class of teachers, he thinks, should be 
trained in seminaries, where a general education is offered, besides 
professional training. For the other teachers he proposes to require 
them to obtain their preparatory education in some of the numerous 
secondary schools; and in the university a new faculty, the “ pedagogi- 
cal,” should offer the required professional training. 
The second question submitted was: 
In what manner, in case the first question be answered in the affirmative, shall the 
general preparatory education be obtained? Is it desirable to (a) establish special 
preparatory schools for teachers, or (b) should the existing normal schools be 
extended downward by establishing preparatory courses, or (c) is attendance of sec- 
ondary schools to be recommended? Ifso, which one, the classical (Gymnasium), 
or the modern (Realgymnasium), or the citizens’ high school (without Latin)? 
The replies to this question exhibit the greatest diversity. Three of 
them plead for perfect liberty of preparation. 
Says one gentleman: 
I lay little stress upon the form of the institutions for that purpose, since they i 
always more or less adapt themselves to given local circumstances; but the contents 
of such schools, i. e., their course of study, is the thing to be considered. My view. . 
is that‘a preparatory institution of a normal school should most resemble the Real- 
gymnasium, yet show individual features. 
Another writes: 
Uniformity in preparation I consider neither practicable nor to the purpose. It is 
no disadvantage to have students of a normal school who come from different pre- 
paratory or secondary schools, provided always, that these institutions have given 
them true intellectual culture and not merely dead, undigested knowledge. At any 
rate, a student applying for admission to a normal school should have passed the 
final examination in a secondary school. The torso education of a junior or sopho- 
more can not suffice as a preparation for a normal-school student. 
In three replies special preparatory schools for normal schools are 
recommended, because none of the existing secondary schools suffi- 
ciently prepares its students in those branches which are essential for 
the practice of teaching, like the German language and literature, 
religion, home natural history, arithmetic, penmanship, and music. Spe- 
cial preparatory schools are recommended, also, because they will make 
possible a more uniform training of the students in the normal schools 
through their having received a like preparation. But in these three 
replies it is expressly stated that graduates of classical or modern high 
schools may be admitted to the normal school. *One gentleman of the 
three pleads for separation of preparatory and normal school; another 
for close organic connection under the same management and roof. 
ED 92 12   
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  178 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
One thinks the preparatory school should also admit students who do 
not intend to devote themselves to teaching. 
In five replies the organic connection between preparatory and nor- 
mal school is urged as the most practical and successful arrangement, 
and an imitation of the plan followed in Saxony is recommended, 
where the normal-school course is one of six years, three of which are 
devoted to preparatory, three to professional study. Only in this way 
the preparation could be had in a proper manner, and carried through 
with the necessary comprehension on the part of the teachers. 
In six replies now-existing secondary schools are considered the 
most suitable preparatory institutions, and all choose that type of a 
school known as the citizen’s high school, without Latin. 
For [so it is said] the special preparatory schools precipitate professional train- 
ing, which in consequence narrows the horizon of thought of the student instead 
of extending it. A school for general culture that does not deal with special pro- 
fessions is not apt to contract the horizon of the student, and is therefore to be 
preferred. All kinds of classical schools estrange the teacher from those classes of 
society in which he is expected to act as educator. The ‘‘six-grade high school” 
proposed unites, however, in its present organization all the requirements of the 
general culture of common-school teachers, and offers the teacher a position in the 
higher—that is, cultured—class of citizens in which he is to act as educator. 
  It may be remarked here that in one of the replies this high school 
is considered suitable as a preparatory institution only because the 
present circumstances make it appear so; otherwise the gymnasium or 
classical high school would be preferable owing to the more thorough 
culture it offers. In still another reply the citizens’ high ‘school is 
rejected, because the scientific and mathematical branches are pressed 
into the foreground, while in the preparation of teachers who will have 
to educate, as well as instruct, the linguistic and historical branches 
should predominate. 
The authors of all these replies stand with regard to the present 
question exclusively upon the standpoint of the normal-school teacher. 
But for elementary-school teachers other considerations are of weight. 
Thus, a speaker in Halle points to the fact that a close connection 
between the preparatory and normal schools, however suitable it may 
be otherwise, would yet carry with it the unavoidable disadvantage 
that the various external considerations (political, clerical, and econom- 
ical) which influence teachers’ training in the State would necessarily 
also influence the management, organization, and course of study of the 
preparatory schools; while the secondary schools of general culture, 
conservative as they are and have been, will not be touched by that 
influence to any great extent. To this is added the other weighty 
consideration that it must be in the interest of the profession to see its 
members conjointly share in the general culture with the members of 
other professions. This would prevent the unpleasantness arising from 
undervaluation and disparagement so frequently met in connection 
with the profession of teaching.
-P-A-G-E-207
  
  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 179: 
The third query submitted was: 
Shail the normal schools be denominational schools or shall they receive students 
of all religious confessions? 
Six of the replies declare in favor of denominational institutions; ten 
in favor of schools in which all confessions are represented. One gen- 
tleman writes: 
This is, in my judgment, not an educational but a political question. The aims of 
popular education and culture may be attained in either case. I have taught for 
many years in a denominational seminary, and even longer in a mixed institution, 
but have not found that a mixture or combination of confessions in any appreciable 
degree influenced the work or secured greater success. se 
One reply contains a decided preference for separation of the reli- 
gious confessions, claiming “ that if the normal school is to act in the 
service of character-building, and is to imitate the family, especially 
where it is a boarding school, the students of different confessions 
must be separated lest the most annoying occurrences might endanger 
the peace of the institution.” Another gentleman, also an objector to 
mixed schools, says: 
In a mixed normal school neither the mother tongue and its literature, nor history 
can be taught in a manner which would allow the future teachers to recognize the 
various momenta and factors of culture in Germany since the Reformation; nor 
could the historical importance and mission of the Protestant Prussian State, through 
which the German individual has become a political citizen, be discussed before 
students of both Christian confessions. 
On the other hand, weighty arguments are advanced in favor of a 
combination. It is said the normal schools are State institutions, and 
since the State is neither Protestant nor Catholic, no educational insti- 
tution belonging to the State should have a denominational character. 
He who trains the teacher denominationally makes him impracticable 
for the German common school, a school that is to promote unity of 
national education. Finally, denominational normal schools endanger 
one of the most essential qualities of good instruction, i. e., objective 
truth. 
In one reply it is said: 
However deeply convinced the undersigned is of the fact that educational insti- 
tutions must be built upon a common basis only when they are to propagate a 
specific spirit, I must yet plead for the common character of the professional normal 
schools. The teachers’ training school is not to be an educational institution, pure 
and simple, designed for character-building. It is to be supposed that the character 
of a young man when he enters a professional school, though that character may 
not be quite developed, is fixed to such extent that he will not tolerate external 
influence upon it. Inner development and self-assertion in religious conviction 
must be left to the individual. On the other hand, the professional training is a 
matter of common concern, There is no specific Catholic multiplication table, or 
Protestant grammar, or Jewish geography. 
The fourth question was: 
Is it desirable to organize teachers’ training schools in the form of boarding 
schools?
-P-A-G-E-208
  180 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
In two replies to this query a decision is declined, since a judgment 
concerning the value or worthlessness of (lormitories connected with 
normal schools is entirely dependent upon the condition of the institu- 
tion. It depends upon the principal and professors entirely. Dinter 
and Diesterweg, it is said, had boarding schools against which no 
objections were raised. 
Only one gentleman expresses himself in favor of boarding arrange- 
ments. He says: 
If the boarding school is neither a military barrack nor a convent it has great 
advantages over the other arrangements according to which the students live in 
private families or other lodgings. The advantages are found in the necessary inten- 
sity of the work which is demanded by the modern training of teachers. 
In seyen replies the authors declare themselves in opposition to the 
compulsory boarding schools, but are not quite willing to give up the 
institutions entirely, since they enable many a poor but capable boy 
to live cheaply and prepare himself for the profession. It is said that 
the boarding-school arrangement would lose all its dangers if, as is 
done in Saxony, admission to it is left to the choice of the students. 
One gentleman writes: 
- The dormitories should be considered a benefit, but charity forced upon a person 
is no charity, and therefore ethically not justified. 
“The right to punish an evil-minded boy by expelling him tempora- 
rily or for good from the benefits of the dormitories,” writes a Saxon 
author, “gives us a most effective means of discipline.” We have had 
no case as yet where that punishment was necessary, hence “conclude 
as aforestated. 
Another author replies: 
Dormitories belong to the provisions of pathological pedagogy, provided they are 
conducted well and arranged according to hygienic principles. Delicate cases are 
known to me that needed careful treatment, and the dormitory has proyed a moral 
hospital. Of course only in this sense it should be made use of in normal schools. 
With much more decision the last seven replies reject the boarding 
arrangement and plead for liberty, so to speak. Only in cases of great 
need, and then only temporarily, should the students be allowed to live 
in the institution, “since experience teaches that the faculty have little 
influence over the spirit and conduct of boys assembled in dormitories. 
The rule should be to make the normal school a day school.” 
There have been cases where the dormitories proved to be beneficial, but the 
general experience is that they are not. It is much more difficult for a faculty to 
govern a boarding than a day school, and everything depends upon the character and 
executive ability of the principal. Moreover, the principal of a boarding school is 
hampered by and burdened with many household cares which infringe upon his 
pedagogical activity. The life in a family exercises a much better influence upon a 
student than conyent life. Of course, as in the other,so in this case, much will 
depend upon the proper choice, 
The fifth question has reference to the selection of the locality of the
-P-A-G-E-209
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 181 
  normal school. ‘Three authors declined a decision on principle regard- 
ing this point. One says: 
The normal schools should be equitably divided according to the population. This 
will locate some in large and some in small cities, according to the character and 
needs of the province. As there are renowned universities in large as well as in 
small cities, so it may be the case with normal schools. It is a matter of self-evi- 
dence that tho schools should be located in county centers for obvious reasons. 
In four replies small towns are preferred. The following reasons are 
advanced : ; 
In our modern time larger cities give too much opportunity for dissipation. The 
period of training needs quietude; the teacher after graduation may look about 
himself in the world, 
Generally smalltowns are preferable because the students can then be supervised 
better, and the circumstances prevailing in those towns are similar to those in which 
the teachers have to liveafterward. Moreover, the rural environments offer oppor- 
tunities and ample material for home geography and natural history as they will 
have to be taught later. 
The use of collections, museums, etc., of a metropolis, or a capital, is not com- 
mensurate with the greater familiarity with country and people that can be gained 
‘in smaller towns. The students of normal schools in large cities can not study in 
museums any more-+than the students from other places who may visit them. 
As far as the members of the faculty are concerned it must be granted that they 
have more social and scientific intercourse in a large city, but literary and scientific 
work on their part is much better performed in quiet, rural surroundings, 
Naturally it will be unavoidable that cities of the size of Berlin and Vienna, haying 
thousands of teachers, must have normal schools of their own. A metropolis has a 
highly developed life and so many peculiar elements of culture that the children 
need city-bred teachers. A country teacher can not well enter at once into the 
cirele of thought of city children. 
Ten replies are in favor of large cities. 
Itissaid that very small towns are apt to countrify the students. On the other hand, a 
metropolis is apt to dissipate and endanger the morals of students not kept in dor- 
mitories but choosing their own lodgings. The best choice would seem to be cities 
of medium size, as these have been found to be the best locations for universities. The 
normal-school student should not be reared so as to estrange him from the world. 
He must feel the incessant throbbing and pulsating of the world, but be equally 
guarded against the danger of moral depravation and intellectual dissipation. 
T consider it very necessary in the selection of the location that intercourse with 
nature be facilitated. This point I eonsider most important. The morbid longing 
of country teachers for positions in the city I attribute to the lack of a well-developed 
love and sense of nature. 
The best plan would seem to be to place the normal schools in suburbs of larget 
cities, since both requisites mentioned may be satisfactorily met there—the vicinity 
of ample sources of culture and the solitude necessary for intellectual labor. 
In very small towns the teacher loses connection with the scientific movements of 
the time; hence the interest of the faculty as well as the students point toward 
cities in whicha high degree of intellectual life is found. 
        
The sixth question was: 
Is the professional training at present offered in normal schools considered to be 
sufficient, or do the present status of the science of pedagogy and the increased 
demands which modern times. make with respect to popular education, justify an 
extension of the course in professional training? 
       
-P-A-G-E-210
  182 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Not one of the replies received answers the first part of the question 
-in the affirmative. On the contrary, all express the opinion more or less 
distinctly and emphatically that the present status of German normal- 
school training is insufficient. Only in one reply is an extension of the 
course considered inadvisable, owing to the fact that the students are 
already overburdened with matter and method. The fact mentioned 
may be true, yet it must be considered whether a different prepara- 
tion for the normal school and a more practical organization of the 
teachers’ entire training may not remove the difficulty. 
Although the question had reference to the professional training 
alone, several replies include the general culture. In one of them it is 
emphasized that the greatest weakness cf the students is found in 
the lack of the thorough general culture. It is said, ““ Here the lever 
should be applied. Only with better prepared students can higher 
demands be made in professional training.” Thus again we see that 
the question of preliminary work is the keynote of the whole subject. 
How insufficient is the present preparation for normal schools is exem- 
plified in some of the replies. One author says: 
It is ridiculous to expect of young people to solve difficult psychological and peda- 
gogical problems when they still wrestle with grammatical and rhetorical rules. 
With regard to the strictly pedagogical professional training the 
necessity of reading educational sources, as well as an extension of the 
instruction in sciences supplementary to pedagogy, such as psychology 
and ethics, are'recommended. This latter instruction should, it is said, 
be so conducted that pedagogical theories are derived from it. In the 
practice school instruction should be given in such a manner that the 
students become convinced of the fact that teaching is an art. Several 
replies object to the dogmatic manner in which professional instruction 
is offered. 
Where the system of pedagogy does not grow out of the practice in school, where 
the practice teacher is not the most experienced, but the youngest of the faculty, one 
may, during the lessons in pedagogical theory, speak with the tongue of an angel— 
the students will after all not profit much by them, but acquire futile examination 
knowledge. 
The seventh question proposed was: 
Are the requirements for the preparation of normal-school professors generally 
considered sufficient? 
In one reply the author declines to give a definite answer, owing to 
the difference of the conditions in the various countries. Four authors 
reply in the affirmative, twelve in the negative. Says one of the latter: 
These requirements may be regarded sufficient as far as the general education 
offered by professors is considered ; but quite insufficient with respect to pedagogical 
qualifications. This is particularly true of the principals of the normal schools, who 
are quite frequently insufficiently prepared for their positions. Until better men are 
put at the head of those institutions, progress in the training of teachers can not be 
expected.
-P-A-G-E-211
  
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 183 
In the second reply we read: 
This is the weakest point and reform is most needed here. The present practice, « 
according to which shipwrecked candidates for higher schools are considered good 
enough for the normal schools, and ambitious theologians are placed at the head of 
normal schools, assisted by young men just graduated, must be considered a graye 
error which may be explained by the want of financial means, but can never be 
excused. Whether the principal or teachers in. the normal schools have received 
their preparation in the theological or philosophical faculty of a university, or only 
in the normal school, is immaterial; but it is not immaterial by any means whether 
they are highly cultivated and experienced educators, or whether they first intend 
to gain their experience in the normal school, according to the popular saying: To 
him whom God gives an office, He also gives the requisite understanding. 
In another reply the author demands that all normal-school teachers 
should possess a university education. : 
The normal-school teacher should, with regard to scientific knowledge, stand on 
the same level with the teachers of secondary schools who must have received an 
academic education. Not only the work they are to perform requires that, but also 
the position, reputation, and importance of the institutions in which they work; in 
various ways this will reflect upon those who are to gain their professional education 
there. This is the cardinal point of all reforms in the training of teachers. Care 
should be taken to enable those who have made their way through normal schools 
to enter such positions by special preparation and study. 
In another reply university education is required only for the prin- 
cipal and a portion of the faculty. 
Most of the authors who advocate reform in this point think it advis- 
able that all normal-school teachers should attend, for several years, a 
pedagogical university seminary. In order to make this possible “the 
conviction that pedagogy is a science, and that it is necessary to rep- 
resent it properly in the faculty of the university, must first be awak- 
ened in Prussian universities.” “This demand,” writes another, “ will 
be unattainable so long as the present indifference for real national 
education continues. This indifference is found where the common- 
school teacher is considered the servant of the pastor, and where a 
professor in the gymnasium is considered a shipwrecked university 
professor.” 
The last question proposed was: 
Are you of the opinion that the education gained in a German normal school, if 
supplemented by continued private study and acknowledged practical results in 
school, is sufficient and will enable ateacher to fulfill the duties of supervisor, either 
as principal of a building or superintendent of a system of schools? Do you con- 
sider it necessary to establish special institutions for the preparation of such officers? ~ 
In most of the replies received the necessity of special institutions 
of this kind is denied; of course, provided that the training of teachers 
should be reformed in the light of the advice stated in the foregoing 
replies. One author says: 
Our present system of training teachers for the common school is entirely insuf- 
ficient for the purpose of preparing supervising officers. 
In most of the replies a special examination for principals and super- 
intendents is urged, “so that all arbitrary promotions be made impos-    
 
-P-A-G-E-212
184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
sible.” With reference to the examining board for this purpose, it is 
-recommended to appoint only educators of acknowledged high culture, 
who are not suffering from the prevailing disease of the age, i. e., are 
not specialists of some kind, so that the entire education of the candi- 
date may be judged fairly. 
A few writers oppose this measure and recommend the custom in 
vogue in Saxony, which is, that candidates for supervisory offices are 
required to attend the university after they have graduated from the 
normal school. In one reply a similar custom in vogue in the canton 
of Berne is pointed out. Here graduates of normal schools have the 
right to attend the lectures of cert in professors of the philosophical 
faculty of the university called the Lehramts-schule (university sem- 
inary). This gives the candidates a claim upon positions m secondary 
schools, and it is from among these teachers that most of the school 
inspectors and normal-school teachers are selected. 
These opinions, rendered as they are by ‘he foremost normal school 
educators of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, have madea profound 
sensation among teachers and government authorities. The educa- 
tional press has reproduced them and commented upon them; even the 
political press in Germany has considered them the most authoritative 
and important contribution to the question of teachers’ training of late 
years, and expressed the hope that the provincial as well as the central 
Government will base future reforms on the advice of these gentlemen. 
The further fact that this symposium was called for and published by 
the National Union of Teachers, a union that has nearly 60,000 mem- 
bers, is most significant, and proves that the teachers themselves are 
not satisfied with the professional education the state offers them. 
From the historical review on previous pages, it has been seen that it 
was always the teachers themselves in central Europe who recognized 
the prevailing inadequacy, and urged reforms. The Government has 
not always been willing to acknowledge the force of the teachers’ eriti- 
cism, but in the course of time it has always acknowledged its justice. 
  VII.—PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS. 
During the months of January and February, 1893, the writer of this 
report was detailed to inspect German normal schools, and to gather 
material that would be useful in giving an accurate picture of the 
present status of professional training of teachers in central Europe. 
To the foregoing historical review and statement of the statistics and 
present condition of the normal schools in central Europe, therefore, 
are added here some personal observations made during several visits 
of inspection in teachers’ preparatory and normal schools. The nature 
of this report requires that these observations be general, leaving 
personalities and localities out of consideration. 
Buildings—In comparison with State normal school buildings in 
New York, Pennsylvania, Ilinois, and other States, the German normal
-P-A-G-E-213
  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 185 
school buildings are very inferior. It has a depressing effect to see the 
most vital rules of hygiene set at naught in these schools, from which 
are to come the teachers of the present and future generations. It is 
the common experience that a teacher will teach “as he is taught,” that 
he will conduct a school as he has seen it done. Hence it is to be 
supposed that the graduates of normal schools in poorly ventilated and 
wretchedly arranged buildings will have no very exalted idea of how a 
school building should be built, or how it should be kept to comply 
with hygienic rules. Circumstances, such as poverty of the state, 
existing local conditions, old buildings which must be utilized, may 
explain, but can never excuse the present insufiicient provision for a 
system of schools of equal importance with the proud system of 
universities in central Europe. 
Even new normal school buildings in Prussia do not come up to the 
standard of American school architecture, having flat, expressionless 
fronts, unbroken rows of windows, and a box-like shape. They betoken 
a want of provision for «esthetic culture, serious if one considers the 
consequences of such a want. The students of such schools can not 
obtain ideals of wsthetic culture, if trained in surroundings that seem 
to poorly fit the purpose they are designed for. 1 
This observation regarding style and poor arrangement of buildings 
is not meant to include a few buildings erected later in large cities, but 
refers to most of those inspected by the writer. It is, perhaps, not too 
much to say that the lack of cleanliness frequently found, the exces- 
sively foul air, the crowded condition and general want of comfort 
and beauty noticed in German elementary schools, are chiefly owing to 
the lack of high ideals in school architecture and esthetic education 
on the part of the teachers and inspectors, who would exert their 
influence toward an improvement in this matter if they had been 
differently trained. 
A visit to a preparatory school.—The State of Prussia maintains a 
nuinber of preparatory institutions in which the candidates for admis- 
sion to the normal schools are specially prepared. Many other schools 
for the same purpose are private, especially in the western provinces. 
Since the candidates for normal schools rarely come from secondary 
schools (see Hist. Review, p. 149) special preparatory institutions seem 
a necessity. The writer inspected two of them, one very closely. 
Here he noticed a fact well known, but rarely heeded by school 
authorities, namely, that the most logical arrangement of matter of 
instruction, the most carefully devised courses of study, the most skill- 
fully prepared appliances for teaching, the most devoted attention to 
study and love of knowledge on the part of students, are as nothing 
compared with the skill of the teacher who knows how to prepare the 
matter and also to prepare the mind for receiving it. A simile may 
illustrate this. The prevalence of indigestion in the United States is 
not owing to thé want of good meat and vegetables, for they are as
-P-A-G-E-214
  186 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  good, if not better here than in other countries, but to bad preparation 
of our food in many kitchens over which ignorant cooks preside, and 
also to the unduly hurried mode of eating prevalent all over the 
country. Just so with the teacher in school. If he work like the 
proverbial cheap restaurant cook, the best course of study (bill of 
fare), the finest appliances (condiments and spices), the greatest atten- 
tion (hunger), will not make the knowledge offered (sole-leather beef- 
steak) palatable or digestive. 
The school visited offered striking examples of good and bad teach- 
ing. The instructors were selected from among the best teachers of the 
city, men who are specially well qualified in certain branches of study. 
Several lessons were offered, most of which were excellent examples of 
pedagogic art and skill; but two were marred by errors such as will 
seriously endanger the future usefulness of the students in the profes- 
sion of teaching, unless they see themselves the glaring contrast 
between good and bad teaching and profit by it. 
The boys (80 in number) sang three and four part music remark- 
ably well and proved that they possessed commendable theoretical 
knowledge of music. 
Then followed a lesson in mental arithmetic, which would have been 
a revelation to many teachers who can not conceive the idea that arith- 
metical problems with numbers of more than two places can be solved 
mentally. The students in this school had such a familiarity with the 
structure and value of the numbers they worked with that they could 
apply them in innumerable ways, analyzing them for the purpose of 
dividing and multiplying. Each problem was pronounced by the 
teacher and repeated verbally by the pupil slowly and deliberately. 
When he had finished this repetition he was usually ready to announce 
the result. At times an analysis was called for, and then it was 
seen what a splendid command of the language the students had, 
for each of the explanations was an almost faultless oral composition. 
The teacher explained that he still followed the Pestalozzian rules: 
(1) “Offer objects at first for the purpose of conceiving the numbers in 
the concrete, and illustrating all numerical operations.” (2) “Create 
a profound and clear idea of the structure and value of each number, 
and train the student in swift and correct mathematical application.” 
(3) “Rely not on mechanical work, such as memorizing of rules and 
working problems by means of them, but insist upon a procedure, the 
first and main object of which is to train the mind to find and make 
rules itself.” (4) ‘Arrange your course so as to afford a procedure 
from the easy to the more difficult, or a step by step arrangement 
which will not leave gaps.” This continuity of instruction was Pesta- 
lozzi’s chief excellence in teaching arithmetic. 
Another lesson given was in history. The teacher demonstrated 
the irrationality of teaching history backward, by beginning with the 
present ruler of Prussia and going into the past. Since this afforded
-P-A-G-E-215
  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 187 
no chance of seeing the cause first and the effect afterward, but presup- 
posed a great amount of historical knowledge in order to judge by 
means of analogous cases from effect to cause, the teacher showed an 
example of how not to proceed. Having clearly established this 
fallacy he took up another period of history and proceeded to illustrate 
the contrary mode of teaching history by proving an evolutionary 
tendency, teaching history biologically, so to speak. This lesson would 
have been an excellent one had it not been marred by an overbearing 
conduct on the part of the teacher, who, regardless of the sensibilities 
of his students and of the presence of guests, scolded and used epithets 
that were out of place in the school room. 
The fourth lesson was in grammar. A finely inflected language, 
such as the German, affords better and much more logical treatment 
than the English; hence good instruction could be expected, but that 
which was offered far surpassed the observer’s expectations. The sub- 
ject of copulative verbs was treated in a masterly way. 
Then followed a lesson in geography, the treatment of which was so 
antiquated that it called to mind the period of common-school teach- 
ing in which such tidbits of information were committed to memory, 
verbatim et literatim, as “Zenith and Nadir are two Arabic terms 
imparting their own signification.” The teacher conducted a veritable 
recitation (A verbal repetition of something committed to memory.— 
Webster.) The items asked for were so irrelevant, so disconnected, so 
illogical, that it seemed as though the minds of his students could not 
possibly profit by learning them. Now, if there is any branch of study 
in the curriculum of the common school calculated to develop the idea 
of cause and effect, it is geography. But what causal connection is 
there between the exact length of the river Elbe and the equally exact 
statement of the elevation of the “ Hohe Tatra” in Hungary? The 
school inspector of the city, who had invited the visitor to this school, 
was so fully aware of the unsatisfactory teaching exhibited that he 
suggested to the teacher to take up one country, say Hungary, with 
respect to (a) topography, (5) climate, (c) soil, (d) inhabitants, (e) occu- 
pations, and to show that there exists a causal connection between 
them. 
However, the attempt made was futile, because it was evident that 
either the teacher himself did not know it or that he refrained from 
making the connection seen. 
Then followed two lessons so ideally excellent that they overshad- 
owed all the foregoing. The one was in zodlogy, the other in physics. 
Reptiles were considered in the former, magnetism was the subject of 
the latter. Zodlogy was taught with a true scientific spirit. The 
teacher did not presume to give information; but he led the boys by 
skillful questioning to find the knowledge themselves, and then express 
it in good language. For instance: “What makes our chest expand? 
Could it be done if all the ribs were grown to the breast bone, or all
-P-A-G-E-216
  188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  the so-called false ribs were bone and not partly cartilage? What 
enables the snake to swallow animals thicker than its own body?” 
The structure of the snake’s skeleton was then hinted at, and the boys 
discovered the peculiarity of its ribs. The teacher of physics pro- 
ceeded with great tact and admirable skill in making facts the basis of 
theories, and leading the boys to use the theories in turn for the pur- 
pose of discovering facts. No text-book was used. 
Most of the teachers exhibited the delicate tact of the true gentle- 
man. They did not disregard the dignity of the young men, yet 
maintained their own authority in a masterly manner. From the con- 
duct of the students it was plainly seen whom of their teachers they 
respected and loved. 
A brief conference of teachers followed the day’s work and the work 
was discussed. One of the speakers laid much stress upon the point 
that it would seem a waste of energy to indulge the students who have 
a definite aim in view in doing anything that could in the least dissi- 
pate their attention from their future profession. It would lift them 
out of their grooves, etc.,—the song is quite old and well known. 
Other speakers dwelled on the indisputable requirement of modern 
education, that all instruction should be directed, first, at the develop- 
ment of the natural talents, and, secondly, at special aimsin life. Man 
is a human being before he is an officer, engineer, teacher, etc., and the 
more the human being is considered the better it will be for the state, 
society, and the individual. 
_A visit to Ad. Diesterweg’s former seat of activity (Moers, in Rhenish 
Prussia) caused disappointment. The school was not in session. The 
director of the institution informed the reporter of the course of study 
and methods generally pursued in Prussian normal schools. One fact 
gleaned from him is, that the managers of the Prussian normal schools 
are prohibited from reporting publicly upon the status and progress of 
their schools. Their written reports are examined by the provincial 
governments and filed away. Publications are issued only when a 
school celebrates an anniversary, and in that case a historical reviewis 
offered. From these publications little can be gleaned of the trends 
of normal-school education in Prussia. The best information concern- 
ing the currents of educational thought in normal schools is found in 
the educational press, which discusses timely questions with candor > 
and much freedom. 
Another fact gleaned from the interview was, that Herbart’s Philoso- 
phy and Theory of Education is looked upon with little favor by the 
managers and teachers of normal schools; that the great majority of 
professors of “pedagogy” appear to lean toward Lotze, and hence, that 
the text-book on pedagogy used in more than 90 per cent of the Prus- 
sian normal schools clearly and distinctly disapproves of Herbart. The 
text-book is that of Ostermann and Wegner. (See Iv, Professional 
Study.

  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 189 
In another normal school the reporter chanced to witness a senior 
student give a composition lesson in the practice department to boys of 
12 years of age. The lesson Was very similar to one of which Dr. M. 
Heidingsfeld (Liegnitz, province Silesia) gives an account in Lehrpro- 
ben und Lehrgaenge. It is here reproduced in English in order to 
illustrate a method of teaching language and composition worthy of 
note and imitation. 
The dying old lion. (A composition lesson.) 
Lessing recommends the invention of Asopian fables as very fruitful composi- 
tion work for pupils of 11 to 13 years of age “not that I should try to make poets of our 
boys, but because it is incontrovertible that the medium by which fables are 
invented is the same which is applied by all inventors. This mediumis the principle 
of reduction. But the application of this principle offers great difficulties. It 
demands extended knowledge of the particulars and of all the individual things upon 
which the reduction is to take place. Even though this knowledge be not wanting 
it will be the wiser plan in the beginning to lead the pupils to find, or reinvent, 
rather than to invent the fable.” 
Such a trial—namely, to let my pupils find a fable—I made in a class of boys of 12 
years, for the purpose of framing a narrative in composition work. It was a very ~ 
successful effort. Lessing’s fable, ‘‘The Dying Lion,” appeared to me the most suit- 
able subject. If I had read this fable 10 the boys their interest would soon have 
lagged during the subsequent conversation. This I prevented by the procedure 
hereafter set forth. When—after this preliminary discussion, during which the 
pupils found the fable, almost identically in words and expression—I read it as the 
poet had written it, it gave them great pleasure. With bated breath they compared 
their own production with that of a master mind. And now the lesson: 
Teacher. We will prepare a composition to-day. I have selected a fable for that 
purpose. What is a fable? 
Pupil. A fable is a narrative in which the active persons are animals. 
Q. What animal often plays a réle in fables?—A. The lion. 
Q. What is the lion usually called?’—A. King of the animals. 
Q. Why is he thus called?—A. Because he is the strongest and most beautiful ani- 
Q. How do other animals look upon the lion?—A. They fear him. 
Q. Why?—A. Because he makes his superiority over them felt in a cruel manner. 
Q. Our fable tells us that an old lion, who had always been very cruel, lay power- 
less in front of his den, and expected death. The news of this spread rapidly among 
the other animals. Now, if they had loved him, what would have been the conse- 
quence?—A. They would have been sorry and have mourned his loss. 
Q. Do you think they had reason to do this?—A. No; indeed not. 
Q. Tell in a general way the reason of their want of sorrow.—A. No one regrets 
the death of an enemy. 
Q. Give this thought in form of a question, introducing it with the word for. 
They did not pity him, for .—A. They did not pity him, for who feels 
sorrow for the death of an enemy? 
Q. Another pupil may try it.—A. , for who would feel sorrow for the 
death of a peacebreaker in whose presence no one can feel secure? 
The thoughts brought out are repeated. 
Q. Now, if the animals did not pity the old, dying lion, what do you think they 
felt?—A. Joy, to be sure; they felt uncommonly glad. 
Q. Why?—A. Because they hoped soon to be free of their cruel enemy. 
Q. State it differently.—A. They felt glad that they would soon get rid of him.     
    
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  
    190 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  Q. Do you think they hid their joy from the lion?—A. No. 
Q. Why not?—A. Because he could not punish them any more. 
Q. In what way do you suppose they expressed their joy?—A. By vexing, net- 
tling, and teasing him, 
Q. Mention some animals that often appear in fables, and which, it is reasonable 
to suppose, were there.—A. The fox. 
Q. Another?—A. The raven. 
Q. Well, yes; but we will leave the birds out of the play this time. Why?—A. 
Because they were not likely to feel a grudge against the lion, never having been 
injured by him. 
Q. Name other animals.—A. The donkey. 
Q. Others.—A. The wolf, the horse. 
Q. Good; I will mention two more who happened to be there, the ox and the boar. 
How do you think the fox vexed the dying lion?—A. He said: ‘See, there lies our 
king, who so cruelly pursued us. A nice king he is, to be sure; he can’t even raise 
his head any more.” 
Q. And the donkey ?—A. He kicked him with his foot. 
Q. With his hoof, you mean, do you not? And the wolff—A. He bit the poor, 
dying fellow. 
Q. That is possible, but in other ways he may have expressed his malicious joy.— 
A. Yes; he may have called him names. 
Q. Very well, and the ox?—A. Oh, he poked him in the ribs with his horns. 
Q. And the boar?—A. He gave him a kick. 
Q. No; I differ from you there. What weapon does the boar use in fighting ?— 
A. His tusks. 
Q. Then we will say the boar dug his tusks into the lion’s sides. What would 
you term such an act? Was it noble and generous?—A. No; it was the act of a 
coward. Now that they were sure the lion could not defend himself they vented 
their spite. 
Q. You are aware that a fable always contains a precept or moral. What moral 
do you see in this one?—A. One should not revenge one’s self on an enemy who can 
not defend himself. 
Q. Will some one express it differently ?—A. It is wrong to revenge yourself on 
an enemy who is no longer able to injure you. 
Q. Does the poet always himself express in words the moral of the fable?—A. No; 
sometimes it has to be guessed from what the actors do in the fable. 
Q. What do yousay?—A. I think sometimes one of the animals expresses the moral. 
Q. Which one of the animals surrounding the dying lion do you think expressed 
it?—A. I believe it was the horse. 
Q. Why?—A. Because it is always called a noble animal. 
Q. How did the horse come to express that moral?—A. It did not like to see the 
other animals treat the dying king so badly. . 
Q. Yes, my son, the noble horse alone stood by and did not wound the lion with 
his hoofs any more tharthe pained him with biting words. What impression did 
this make upon the other animals?—A. It astonished them, and they asked the 
horse to show the king his contempt and punish him for his cruel treatment of former 
days. 
Q. What animal may have thus asked the horse?—A. The fox. 
Q. Possibly. What other animal?—A. The donkey. 
Q. Why?—A. Because he is a relative of the horse. 
Q. Who can give a better reason?’—A. Because horse and donkey have the same 
mode of defense; they use their hoofs: 
Q. Well, yes, it was the donkey who asked the horse whether he would not also 
punish the lion for having once cruelly torn to pieces the horse’s mother. At what 
place in a fable is the moral usually found?—A. At the end.
-P-A-G-E-219
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. : 191 
  Q. Then who was it that spoke last?—A. The horse. 
Q. Then there remains to be stated the order in which the animals are to be men- 
tioned in the fable. How shall we arrange them?—A. According to their mode of 
revenge. 2 
Q. What difference do you perceive in their modes of revenge?—A. Some revenged 
themselves with words; others by using violence. 
Q. Which ones used words?—A. The fox and the wolf. 
Q. Which ones violence?—A. Donkey, ox, and boar. 
Q. But, as we have seen, the donkey is the one to address the horse, so it will be 
better to mention ox and boar before the donkey. Which animal’s revenge seems to 
you the meanest of all?—A. That of the donkey. 
Q. Why?—A. Because he hits the lion from behind. 
Q. Yes; the stupid ass does not even think the king worthy of a look. Now, state 
‘what order we shall adopt.—A. We ought to begin with the most refined kind of 
revenge and end with the coarsest. 
Q. Why will this be the best arrangement?—A. It will bring out the generosity of 
the horse the more forcibly. 
The order observed by the poet was observed also by the pupils, to wit: ‘The 
wily fox revenged himself by sarcastic remarks and biting speeches; the wolf 
advanced with coarser ammunition; ox and boar applied violence; but the donkey 
revenged himself in the meanest way—he expressed his contempt without looking 
at the lion, and only giving him a kick from behind.” 
Q. Now let us select a fitting heading for our fable. What do you propose?—A. 
The Lion and the Animals, 
Q. What! all the animals?—A. No; the lion, 1 the fox, the wolf, the ox, the boar, 
the donkey, and the horse. 
Q. But that would be too long a heading. Let us suggest another.—A. The Gen- 
erosity of the Horse. 
Q. Very good; but is not the lion the principal figure?—A. Well, we might say 
the Sick Lion. 
Q. Lam afraid that is too narrow; it does not cover enough. The lion was not 
only sick.—A. He was also old. 
Q. If the lion had only been sick, I suspect the animals would not have dared ‘a 
treat him as they did.—A. No; he might have gotten well again, and then have 
punished them. 
Q. Precisely; for that reason it seems best to select the heading, ‘‘The Dying Old 
Lion.” Now, I will read you the fable as Lessing wrote it. Listen: 
“An old lion, who had always been very cruel, lay powerless in front of his den, 
and awaited death. The animals who had feared him greatly did not pity him, 
for who would feel sorry for the death of a peace disturber, before whom no one 
ean feel secure? The animals were glad to get rid of him. Some of them, who 
were still smarting under the wrongs he had done them in former days, now gave 
vent to their hatred. The wily fox vexed him with sarcastic remarks; the wolf 
used coarser expressions; the ox poked his horns into the lion’s sides, and the boar 
wounded him with his tusks; even the lazy donkey gave him a kick with his hoof. 
The noble horse alone stood by calmly, and did nothing, although this lion had 
killed the horse’s mother. ‘Are you not going to give him a kick, too?’ asked the 
donkey. Solemnly the horse replied: ‘No, for I consider it villainous to revenge 
myself upon an enemy who can not injure me any longer.’” ~ 
Q. Into how many parts may we divide the story?—A. In two—the revenge of 
the animals and the generosity of the horse. 
Q. Is not the revenge to be introduced by some statement which can explain it?— 
A. The condition of the lion. 
Q. So, then, we may count three parts. Which are they?’—A. Condition of the 
lion; revenge of fox, wolf, ox, boar, and donkey; conduct of the horae.

Q. Now repeat the fable in your own words. Fred tell the first, Paul the second, 
Max the third part. (It is done.) Now I will read it once more, Some one will 
narrate it again. 
After this the boys were told to write out the fable, and I need not 
assure my readers that it was done very well. 
A VISIT TO ANOTHER PRUSSIAN NORMAL SCHOOL, 
  The building.—In a quiet, sleepy little town, connected by railways 
with large industrial centers, the Government has erected a large build- 
ing with two spacious wings for the special purpose of giving the nor- 
mal school of the district a suitable home. The structure is very fine, 
and reminds one of true American school architecture. It is large, 
handsome, commodious, well ventilated, and surrounded by extensive 
yards and gardens. The stairs and halls are covered with linoleum, 
the windows are large, the walls delicately tinted, and the general 
session room (used as a chapel) decorated with beautiful fresco borders 
and other ornaments. Altogether the building is one of the few worthy 
habitations of a teacher’s training school, particularly because it 
impresses the students with a correct idea of what a good school build- 
ing is or ought to be. 
Biblical history —The writer passed a day in this school, and was 
well repaid for getting up at 6 o’clock a.m. on a raw winter day, 
traveling an hour on the railway, and calling on the rector before 8 
o’clock—that is, in time for opening school. The first lesson he heard 
was one in biblical history. The rector had announced on the previous 
day that he would give a model lesson to young pupils, in presence of 
the senior class of students. Indeed, it was a model lesson in more 
senses than he understood that technical term. The subject of the 
lesson was: “The wise men from the East following the star, and 
coming to Jerusalem to inquire of King Herod where the new-born 
King of the Jews might be found; then being told to go to Bethlehem, 
and there finding Jesus, giving Him their presents and worshiping 
Him.” 
The rector told the whole story in plain, unassuming words, such as 
the little pupils could understand. By such simple means as describ- 
ing the mode of traveling in the East; the poor, modest dwelling of the 
Holy Family, ete., he succeeded in creating vivid mental pictures. 
Then he questioned the little ones on a part of the story, namely, on 
the journey to Jerusalem and the inquiries of Herod. The rector’s 
skill in the art of questioning could not be adequately conveyed except 
by a stenographie report. After this part of the story was well worked 
over, and every incident explained, or called forth by leading questions, 
two pupils had to repeat the part, and they did it with singular faithful- 
ness as regards facts and expression. Errors of speech were corrected 
on the spot, but never in a humiliating way, nor so that the thread of 
the conversation was broken or tangled.

Then the second part—Herod’s inquiries, the mention of the prophet 
Micah, the journey to Bethlehem, and the finding of Jesus—followed. 
In this part of the story the insincerity of Herod, and his evil intentions 
were dwelt,upon, and a distress could be noticed on the faces of the 
youngsters when they heard that a king should so debase himself as 
to say one thing and mean another. Again, all the minute details of 
this part of the narrative were brought out by skillful questioning, and 
the answers were very faithful, both in regard to facts and expression. 
Again, as before, a review was had in connected repetition. 
The third part was treated likewise, and here the presents, gold, 
incense, and myrrh, gave rise to a pretty explanation, childlike but all- 
sufficient. After this part was repeated, a general review followed. 
One little boy told one part, another the second, a third the last; and 
the singular faithfulness with which they repeated whole sentences 
in almost identically the same words could only be attributed to the 
consistency with which the rector had clung to these expressions all 
through the lesson. Then he concluded by showing a handsome illus- 
tration in which the Holy Family, the wise men, the servants, the camels, 
the star, the presents, etc., were shown. This fixed every item of the 
whole story in the memory of the little ones. 
All through the masterly lesson the seniors sat apparently with bated 
breath, making notes now and then. When the little ones were dis- 
inissed, the students were questioned as to what they had heard. 
Object of the lesson, means employed, psychological references, methods, 
principles of method, I know not what words to use to give my readers 
an adequate idea of how that model lesson was analyzed. The rector 
gave the students free scope to express their judgment. It seemed that 
if any of these young men did not take away treasures of knowledge, 
of skill in handling a class, and methodical treatment of matter, it cer- 
tainly was not the fault of the rector and his pupils. 
Literature.—The second lesson heard was a lesson in German litera- 
ture. It began with the reading of a composition upon Lessing’s 
“Minna von Barnhelm,” the first distinctly German drama, Though 
the diction of the student was faulty at times the composition was 
unquestionably an original effort of rare merit. The professor (not the 
rector) proceeded in his criticism with that delicacy which is the dis- 
tinctive sign of a thoroughbred gentleman. It was obvious that the 
most friendly relations existed between him and the students. Never- 
theless he spoke very much to the point, and the students assisted him 
in correcting with praiseworthy zeal. 
The vistas which were opened to the students in the realm of German. 
literature were wide and pleasant. There was nothing of that gnaw- 
ing at the shell, or of that splitting of hairs, which is sometimes - 
observed in the teaching of literature, where the students never get to 
see the forest on account of the multitude of trees. In short, the 
‘lesson was characteristic, inasmuch as it was free from that petty, 
ED 92——13
-P-A-G-E-222
  | 194 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
% annoying criticism indulged in where conformity with the exact text 
of the book is the criterion of successful study. This professor was a 
master in the art of questioning such as is rarely met. Altogether 
the lesson left a pleasant impression, and the conclusion was that the 
students would, later in life, do very well to copy their teacher. 
Natural history.—The next lesson heard was one in zodlogy. And 
here again, as so often in Germany, the principle illustrated was that 
observation is the foundation of cognition. Birds were studied like 
that proverbial fish of Agassiz. Stuffed birds were available in large 
numbers. Colored pictures assisted where objects were wanting; and 
the lesson proceeded as one would wish every lesson in zodlogy to 
proceed: (1) Actual observation established percepts; (2) several of 
these formed concepts; (3) these then were grouped by collecting the 
essentials and dropping minor items to establish clear-cut ideas. The 
latter were well expressed. When a number of them were available 
conclusions were drawn from them. Thus the process of gathering 
knowledge and strengthening the thinking power was successfully 
exemplified. Some of the steps taken were superfluous, it seemed, in a 
class of adults, but it was the evident desire of the professor to make 
these young men learn in precisely the way in which they are to cause 
young children to learn afterward. 
It was with much curiosity that I heard the students state their 
observations of domestic birds. We are very apt to think that we 
know all about them, and that in zodlogy the attention should be 
directed to the birds which the children are never likely to see. This 
lesson converted one to the opinion that we know much less of domestic 
birds than we think we do. . It was with much curiosity that the writer 
heard the students state the difference in the mode of drinking between 
pigeons and chickens, to wit, that the pigeon sucks water by keeping 
its beak almost closed and causing a vacuum in the throat, while the 
hen dips or ladles water with the lower part of the beak and then raises 
its head to let the water run down into the craw. ‘The causes were 
looked for and found in the peculiar build of the beaks of the different 
birds. Monogamy among the pigeons, polygamy among the fowls, the 
peculiar flight of pigeons, swallows, and other birds which was traced 
to the form of the wings and feathers, and various other things of great 
interest were brought out, all of which gave opportunity for tracing 
effect back to cause, and to judge from cause to effect. | 
This kind of instruction is very interesting, and as different irom the 
old-time zodlogy lessons as day is from night. No text-book in zodlogy, 
botany, or mineralogy was used, but each pupil had an atlas which - 
contained at least several thousands of exquisite illustrations of natural 
objects, accompanied by a few pages of print containing a table of con- 
tents and a key to pronunciation. 
Drawing.—The drawing lesson seen was poor and the results meager. 
This department was evidently the weakest point in the institution.  
-P-A-G-E-223
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 195 
  Music.—A lesson on the church organ gave a fair sample of the 
thoroughness with which the students are prepared for organist’s serv- 
ice in church. Each student, as his turn came to play a hymn, was 
told to play a prelude of his own composition. Thus, for instance, if 
the hymn was written in D major, he would start in E major and, by 
way of seventh chords, try to reach D through A. Or, beginning at C 
major, he would go upward through D into G, and then through A 
into D. These were some of the easiest preludes. This practice made 
the young men free and easy at the instrument. But the pedal proved 
full of pitfalls, as it naturally will to beginners. After three years of 
daily practice, good results are obtained. 
Geography.—Then followed a lesson in geography, in which a pro- 
fessot illustrated the principle of concentric instruction, by drawing 
into this. lesson history, physics, meteorology, etc., and thus making 
the lesson have connection with many other branches of study. Through 
all his visits in German schools the writer had not had the chance of 
hearing a lesson in the geography of the United States. Here fortune 
favored him, and the readers may imagine his pleasure when he heard 
Washington pronounced Udshington, and not Vashington; New York, 
not Noy York; Maine, not Mine, etc. It was a very pleasant surprise 
to him. He inquired whether the teacher spoke English, and, upon 
receiving a negative answer, inquired how it came that he pronounced 
the English and American geographical names correctly. The answer 
was: 
We are careful in looking up the pronounciation, for we insist upon pronouncing 
each name correctly. As there can be but one correct pronunciation of the name of 
the river Spree, namely, Spray (else Berlin would be constantly ‘‘on a spree”), so 
there can be but one correct pronunciation of Ohio, namely, Ohio, not Oheeo, as we 
Germans might be tempted to pronounce it. We are aware of the fact that English- 
speaking nations Anglicize all geographical names. This we consider wrong. We 
. follow the golden rule; ‘‘Do as you would be done by.” Of course, ignorance may 
excuse a man’s mispronunciation, but a teacher who excused himself by claiming 
not to know how Frenchmen pronounce their geographical names, or Americans 
theirs, deserves to be dismissed. 
A review of the politic.1l geography of the Union led to an historical 
outlook upon its rapid growth, and there teacher and pupils revealed a 
familiarity with American history which brought the lamentable ignor- 
ance of the average American teacher regarding German history into 
bold relief. Our remoteness makes us rather exclusive, and it is well 
to call attention to it, and make us measure ourselves by the standards 
of others. Asa rule, we find less ignorance concerning America among 
teachers in Germany than among French teachers—a statement which, 
it is hoped, is readily believed. The teacher in this grade was a gentle- 
man of the highest type, who treated his students like gentlemen, and. 
never intentionally or otherwise wounded their sensibilities. 
Arithmetic.—Then followed a lesson in arithmetic. Petcentage was 
the subject of discussion. Problems were solved orally with a rapidity 
which fairly left the visitor behind. He asked permission to put a few
-P-A-G-E-224
  196 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. ' 
questions to the students, and among other things asked them to tell 
how they would begin the study of percentage, and at what age in the 
course? The answer was very gratifying, to wit, expressions couched 
in the term “per cent” might be taught in connection with reduction 
of fractions. Thus, for instance, the children might be taught that 
one-fourth is equal to twenty-five hundredths, or twenty-five parts of 
one hundred. The subsequent practice of percentage would thus 
receive an early foundation. 
Daily programme.—Passing through the hall the writer copied the 
characteristic items of the daily programme to give his readers a fair 
sample of how to get sixteen hours’ work out of twenty-four: 
6 to 6:30.—Rising, dressing, washing. 
6:30 to 7:30.—Preparing lessons under supervision. 
7:30 to 7:50.—Breakfast. 
7:50 to 8.—Opening exercises in chapel. 
8 to 1.—Lessons and experimental teaching. 
1 to 1:80.—Dinner. 
1:30 to 2.—Playing and walking in the grounds. 
2 to 5.—Lessons in academic department. 
6 to 6.—Practice in instrumental music. 
6 to 7.—Outdoor exercises. 
7 to 7:30.—Supper. 
7:30 to 9:30.—W orking in class-rooms under supervision. 
9:50 to 10,—Evening prayer. 
10.—Retiring.

INTRODUCTION. 
Switzerland is a democratic federal republic, consisting of twenty-two 
states or cantons, each of which manages its own local affairs, while 
the Federal Government attends, as with us, to those affairs that pertain 
to the whole country. 
Area, 15,976 square miles; population, according to census of 1888, 2,933,334 
(183 to tho square mile), of which, however, only 2,917,740 were residents. The can- 
tons are named in German and French, as follows:

in one; or 2,092,530 inhabitants of Switzerland speak German, 637,972 
speak French, 156,606 Italian, and 38,375 Romansch. The number of 
those who speak two, or even three languages is very great, but can not 
be ascertained from the census. 
GENERAL VIEW. 
  Switzerland has no national school system; that is, a system of ele- 
mentary and secondary schools established and maintained by the 
Federal Government; neither has it a federal school law. The constitu- 
tion of the Federation, however, prescribes that— ‘ 
(1) The Federal Government has the right to establish a polytech- 
nicum, a federal university, and other institutions of higher instruction, 
or to subsidize institutions of such character. 
(2) The separate states or cantons must provide for sufficient ele- 
mentary instruction under exclusive state supervision. This instrue- 
tion is obligatory, and in public schools gratuitous. The public schools 
must be open for all religious denominations without restriction to 
their liberty of faith and conscience. 
(3) The Federal Government is empowered to take the proper meas- 
ures to enforce this provision in cantons that fail to fulfill their duty. 
(4) Liberty of faith and conscience is inviolable. No one may be 
coerced to become a member of a religious body, attend any religious 
instruction, or participate in religious exercises. According to the 
foregoing principle, parental authority or that of the guardian provides 
for or directs the religious education of children up to the sixteenth 
year of age. 
Within these limits fixed by the Federal Constitution, each of the 
cantons and semicantons established and arranged a public school 
system according to its own laws and special needs or intentions. 
Hence itis plain that the little country, having a smaller area than 
the two States, Vermont and Massachusetts, taken together, and a popu- 
lation almost equal to that of Vermont, Massachusetts, and Rhode 
Island taken together, has a great variety of school systems no two of 
which are identical, yet all of which are similar, for nearly all the various 
systems follow essentially the same principles, especially in the reformed 
cantons Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, Thurgau, Ziirich, Aargau, Solothurn, 
Berne, Waadt, Basel, and others. Perhaps the greatest differences to 
be observed are found to exist between the French and the German 
cantons, but these differences chiefly refer to secondary and higher 
institutions of learning, scarcely to elementary schools. 
A state of affairs such as this is not new to us, since the same condi- 
tions prevail in our country, where every State is left to establish, main- 
tain, and regulate its own school system. Yet the absolute publicity 
in matters of public interest causes a similarity in efforts and results 
which prevents confusion. It is thus in all governmental relations and 
public affairs. We see areform in balloting, for instance, begun in one

State and continued in others whose legislative bodies imitate the 
“measure taken elsewhere. It is reasonable to suppose that the various 
laws that make the application of the Australian ballot system manda- 
tory show slight variations, yet the essential features of that system 
are secured by all these laws. Movements that are likely to prove of 
general benefit to the public are supported by the people of the whole 
Union without regard to State boundaries. A similar procedure is 
witnessed in the schools. Though no two State school laws of the 
Union are identically alike, and though with regard to their organiza- 
tion even vital differences may be perpetuated by these laws, yet it is 
not difficult to state in general lines the objects, methods, and results 
of the American public school which is thus spoken of as though it 
were a homogeneous institution or a uniform system. 
Mr. Morf, a well-known Swiss writer on educational questions, says 
in Der Lehrer Leumund: 
One of the most splendid results of popular education is the awakening and foster- 
ing of the beautiful and grand idea of humanity, the importance of the human being 
as such. It is not so very long ago that the people were left ignorant of their 
powers in the State. History knew nothing of the existence of the mass, except 
when it was assembled on the battlefield to fight for the interest and the glory of its 
Jords. The aim and object of the State have changed; they are not now the pomp, 
glory, or pleasure of a few, but the welfare and rights of all. Formerly the Govern- 
ment was in Switzerland, as it is still in other countries, an inherited monopoly, pro- 
tected by the theory of the divine right. At present in Switzerland offices and 
honors are open to competition; they fall to him in whose hands the people consider 
their rights most securely protected. 
_ Formerly the activity of our Government had no higher object than to secure and 
preserve the privileges and property of a few. Now it aims at granting everyone 
the means to make his life worth living, and to secure to him the undisturbed enjoy- 
ment of human rights. Our modern codes do not contain the word privileges (pri- 
vate rights). This is the stream of modern life, and the common school has aided 
essentially in clearing away its obstructions. Some people who view this broad 
stream look upon it as a wild flood that causes vast destruction; we seo in ita bless- 
ing, a river that waters the desert and changes it to fertile land. 
But in whatever way we may consider it, as a destructive flood or a beneficent 
current, the powerful current is there; it can not be stemmed or dammed; no human 
power can turn it back. The wealth of aptitudes and creative power latent in the 
mass of humanity is without limit. Popular education is bound to free them. It 
not only seeks to do so but does it. It purposes to make the intellect and the deep, 
glowing love for all that is good, noble, and beautiful the rulers and the foremost 
great powers of the world. 
The great importance of the present rational elomeraney school instruction lies in 
tbe fact that it exercises and strengthens the powers of the mind. ‘The so-called old 
school offered a quantity of knowledge and a certain degree of skill, but it left the 
mind undeveloped. Formerly the acquisition of knowledge was the aim; now it is 
regarded asa means, Knowledge is now acquired incidentally, as it were, in the 
effort at awakening and strengthening the mind and fostering the inborn faculties. 
~ This school is young with us, as it is in all other countries; itis scarcely sixty years 
old. Let it grow to be a hundred or two hundred years, and it will give to the 
people what the highest pedagogical authorities have promised—a new heaven and a 
new earth. That our people (Iam speaking here of the canton of Ziirich) have 
recognized the importance of the common skool, may be seen from the fact that the 
maintenance of the schools costs 18 francs. or $3.70, per inhabitant.

200 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
I.—HIisToRIcAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE Swiss ScHOOL SysTEM. 
A.—DURING THE MIDDLE AGES. 
  $s school system has had the same beginnings that the systems 
in other central European countries have had—that is, first, convent, 
cathedral, and parochial schools, founded by the clergy, followed in 
later centuries by secular schools in cities, established by municipal 
authority. In preserving and nurturing science after the ravages of 
the great migration the order of St. Benedict was specially meritori- 
ous. Later orders followed ascetic methods, henee do not deserve 
attention in this connection. During the time of the Carlovingians 
it was the school of the monastery in Reichenau which added materi- 
ally to the preservation of culture. Walafried Strabo (died 849 A. D.) 
left us a vivid and interesting description of this school. During the 
tenth and eleventh centuries the abbey of St. Gallen was a center of 
culture for the whole of southern Germany. 
In Burgundian, now French Switzerland, the abbey of St. Maurice 
(founded in the fifth century) was an ancient seat of monastic culture. 
In the seventh century Romainmotiers in Vaud, St. Ursanue and Mon- 
tier-Grandval in Berne were famous. In Allemannian, now German 
Switzerland, besides St. Gallen and Reichenau, which were foundations _ 
of the eighth century, the abbeys of Beromiinster, Einsiedeln (tenth 
century), and Engelberg (twelfth century) must be mentioned. In 
Riitia, or Italian Switzerland, the abbeys Disentis (seventh century), 
St. Luci, near Chur (seventh century), and Miinster (eighth century) 
are worthy of note. The cathedral schools of Geneva, Lausanne, Con- 
stance, and Chur at times promoted the education of the clergy with 
great zeal and success. 
This era of flourishing ecclesiastical culture, lasting as it did far aie 
the time of the crusades, was followed by the fierce contests between 
emperors and popes and similar struggles between the ecclesiastical 
and secular principalities, and in consequence the education of the 
priests degenerated. Even in St. Gallen, in 1298, the abbot and the 
majority of the monks were unable to write, likewise, in 1335, all the 
canons of St. Felix and Regula in Ziirich, except one. The Latin 
school in this institution was no longer taught by Brother Scholasticus 
of the order, but. by a nonresident teacher, who received a salary. 
Many cities had such Latin schools, mostly supported by the cathe- 
drals and monastic orders. Besides these there arose during the latter 
part of the Middle Ages a number of schools in which the vernacular 
of the place was the medium of instruction; they were called writing 
schools and were taught by traveling schoolmasters. The caiendar 
of Ziizich of 1508 calls it a laudable and desirable custom to teach 
writing and reading to children from 6 to 12 years of age before they 
begin to learn trades. Outside of the walls of the cities and abbeys 
school education was not to be tound.
-P-A-G-E-229
  
THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 201 
During the second half of the fifteenth century the liberal wave of 
humanistic study had entered-Switzerland, and at the same time the 
art of printing opened new channels for the diffusion of knowledge. 
Basel began to be a shining light of learning owing to the university 
founded in 1460 and the efforts of the famous learned printers, Froben 
and Amerbach. Such industrial and intellectually striving cities as 
* Giirich did not have a printing office for thirty years after Basel had set 
the example. Geneva, however, followed Basel at once by establishing 
a printing office, and the remote abbey of Beromiinster claimed to 
have published the first printed book in Switzerland in 1470. The 
claim has subsequently proved erroneous. 
B,—THE PERIOD OF THE 13 CANTONS, 1513-1798, 
A few years after Appenzell had been admitted into the confedera- 
tion of sovereign cantons, and thus the confederation had reached the 
extent it preserved up to the time in which it was demolished, Switz- 
erland began to make efforts in behalf of church reformation, which 
efforts were strongly supported by Ziirich and in fact emanated from 
there. The cantons divided sharply on religious questions, and con- 
tests and competition arising from these questions essentially influ- 
enced the further deyelopment of Swiss civilization. In the schools 
the religious or ecclesiastical interest became much more prominent 
than it had been in previous centuries. The great church reformers 
estimated the schools according to their value, for the church took 
them into its service and reorganized them, as well as the whole State, 
according to religious ideas. 
Hence the higher schools established or remodeled by the reformers 
(the “Lectorium” of Zwingli in Ziirich, the “ Academy” of Calvin in 
Geneva, 1559) were at first theological seminaries exclusively. Butas 
early as 1541 the Ziirich institution opened its doors for a professor of 
natural sciences, and that in Geneva reserved three hours a week for 
mathematics and physics, and temporarily a chair for medical science 
was occupied. One of the results of the Reformation consisted in 
attracting renowned teachers to the universities, also in building up 
a complete system of higher education from the Latin or preparatory 
school to the university (or academy as it was called), and lastly, 
in making higher studies accessible to the poor strata of society. 
Zwingli’s liberal conception of a broad basis of education that 
prompted him to extend the system of preparatory or Latin schools to 
the country (he founded schools at Kappel, Riiti, and Stein) did not 
find much favor in a subsequent generation, for during the middle of 
the century these schools fell victims to the current of the time which 
leaned toward founding and maintaining German schools. 
Higher education became and remained for a long time “an orna- 
ment of the cities.” The narrowmindedness of the Protestant popu- 
“ lation, expressed in the cantonal governments, allowed higher educa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
    202 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
tion to become a city monopoly. This exclusiveness was not found in 
Catholic cantons, where the free entrance to the ecclesiastical profes- 
sion was promoted by the monasteries. The colleges of the Jesuits, 
which sprang into existence with an almost elementary force about 
the same time, led to a beneficial competition between Catholic and 
Protestant seats of higher education. 
While the great reformers bestowed much care upon the Latin 
schools and higher education, the documents in the city archives give 
no evidence whatever that they also favored and promoted popular 
education on the basis of the mother tongue. Y¥et it is plainly notice- 
able that popular education received the strongest impetus through the 
Reformation in Switzerland as well as in other countries. ‘The con- 
trasts arising in matters of faith created intellectual life, and the 
desire to confirm the teachings of the new faith in the growing genera- 
tion.” The sermons from the pulpit were soon supplemented by regular 
instruction in catechism, especially to children. The services in church 
were fashioned to meet their understanding, hence divine services were 
conducted for children separate from those for adults. These juvenile 
services were obligatory, and extended to young people of 18 to 20 
years of age, in some cases even to all unmarried. The Bible became 
a domestic reading book; a large part of the Psalms, Proverbs, and 
Biblical stories became common property. x 
The principle of the Reformation which did away with priestly medi: 
ation between wan and divinity required that each one be responsible 
to himself concerning the truth of his faith, i. e., its conformity with - 
Holy Writ. This requirement became more powerful as the constant 
controversies between Protestant and Catholic theologians, as well as 
the contests between church tenets and dissenting views that arose in 
opposition to the clergy, kept the people in suspense and turmoil. Thus 
the desire to spread the arts of reading and writing grew rapidly. The 
importance of the church reformation for popular education lies in the 
fact that it not only promoted the establishment of elementary schools 
in cities, improved their condition, their course of study and methods 
of instruction, but also that it carried school education beyond the city 
walls into the open country and created a desire among the peasants 
to learn reading and writing. 
In the cities the beginnings of vernacular schools had everywhere 
been made, but now these schools were made to serve ecclesiastical . 
purposes... It was done by subjecting them to church supervision, or 
at least by allowing the ministers of the church to participate in their 
supervision. In the open country and villages elementary schools 
developed from the Sunday instruction in church. The synod of Ziirich 
in a circular letter to the clergy of Berne in 1562 closed with the advice - 
“not to spare time or efforts in behalf of the young.” This proves how 
earnestly the pastors considered the care for elementary instruction to 
be an essential part of their duties. :
-P-A-G-E-231
  THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 203 
The great start popular education made in the Protestant cantons 
induced the Catholic Church to similar efforts. The resolutions of the 
Council of Trent with reference to the establishment of schools for 
the young were brought nearer their execution by Episcopal orders 
in 1564. Thus in the democratic cantons of original Switzerland (Ur- 
schweiz) a system of rural elementary schools was established in a com- 
paratively short time. Much less favorable were the prospects in the 
rural districts of the so-called Catholic city cantons. Solothurn (or 
Soleure) was the only canton whose government bestowed. attention 
upon education in the open country and granted financial aid to good 
teachers. In the districts belonging to Freiburg, Luzerne, and other 
towns, over which Ziirich and Berne had no influence, the rural school 
system was either left undeveloped or was totally neglected. This 
state of affairs continued till the ancient confederation broke to pieces 
in 1798. 
The reaction caused by the devastation of the terrible thirty-years’ war 
in central European culture was spared to Switzerland. But the social 
turmoil caused by: the eruel peasants’ war had a partial reaction upon 
the rural schools. Thus the government of the Catholic canton Solo- 
thurn, that had done much for the maintenance of schools, resolved as 
follows: “It is left free to the peasants to keep schoolmasters, but the 
lords of the manors will no longer contribute to their support.” In the 
Protestant city cantons the school regulations of the first half of the 
eighteenth century are, with exception of unessential variations, copies 
of those in vogue during the seventeenth century. 
Under such circumstances it can scarcely be called an advantage 
that the clergy in the rural districts and villages withdrew from the 
actual business of teaching and left it to secular teachers. The school 
did not gain in reputation thereby, and it was moreover removed from 
the good will of the ruling powers, since the latter were essentially 
religious. But as a foundation of subsequent development of the 
schools this change was of the most vital importance. The profession 
of teaching, and the people’s school, became thus a subject of inde- 
pendent interest, and the intellectual movement (the era of enlighten- 
ment) that characterized the second half of the eighteenth century 
did not hesitate to take hold of the problem of popular education with 
enthusiasm and persistence, a thing that would have been impossible 
if the schools had still been appendages of the church and teaching a 
function of the pastors. 
Indeed, the last few decades of the eighteenth century manifested 
great efforts in behalf of popular education. We notice in all the 
cantons beginnings of school reform borne by popular will and proving 
to be spontaneous. The reform of the whole school system of Ziirich, 
during the years from 1765 to 1774, is remarkable, not so much for its 
results and immediate improvements, as by the zeal and enthusiasm 
with which the clergy and statesmen studied the existing conditions
-P-A-G-E-232
  204 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
and the means of improvement, in order to create a system that should 
be a model for other cantons. The Helvetian Society (founded in 
1761) offered its hall and moral aid to the school reformers. The 
seminary Holdenstein-Marschlins (founded 1761 by Martin Planta), 
gave a shining example of natural education for higher classes, sev- 
eral years previous to the opening of the Philanthropin in Dessau, 
Germany. 
It is well known how much sympathetic interest Pestalozzi found 
among the Bernese mayors (Landvégte) of the vicinity, when he made 
his educational attempts at Neuhof. In the convents of Kreuzlingen 
and St. Urban, Felbiger’s methods were introduced, and the publica- 
tion of text-books and appliances in accordance with them was pushed 
zealously. Suitable candidates and teachers were prepared by special 
courses of instruction. Yet, despite all these laudable attempts, the 
result consisted more in lamentations over the inadequacy of existing 
institutions than in tangible results. The people had become pain- 
fully conscious of the low condition of education, and groped vainly 
for remedies that would improve the entire system. 
For, generally speaking, the Swiss school system at the close of the 
eighteenth century, even in the most progressive cantons, stood on a 
lower plane of development than that of many a principality in Ger- 
many at that time. The rural schools were open in winter only; here 
and there school was kept a few half days per week in summer. The 
teachers were frequently not in possession of the most scanty elemen- 
tary knowledge; they were dependent upon the pastor of the place, 
poorly paid, supported chiefly by tuition fees which they had to collect 
themselves. They were often obliged to ply a trade, or serve as 
sacristan in church to increase their scanty income. Their election 
was nearly always determined by exterior causes (such as being a 
resident, in needy circumstances, and having a suitable room that 
could be used for school purposes) than by their professional prepara- 
tion and moral character. Few localities had their own school houses; 
the rooms used for school purposes often served as workshops and as 
a part of the family dwelling. Here and there the school was an 
ainbulatory one, hence the necessity arose to board the schoolmaster, 
who spent one week at each house or settlement. To institute general 
attendance at school of all the children of a district was impossible, 
owing to inadequate provision for seating all. There were scarcely 
beginnings made in methodical treatment of the matter of instruction, 
or the grading of pupils, in providing for proper seats and suitable 
appliances for teaching. This is the picture of the Swiss rural school 
system, as it appeared in 1799, in the replies to queries sent out by 
the minister of state, Mr. Stapfer. In small towns the circumstances 
were not much better. 
The cause of such a disproportion between conception and execution 
lay in the prevailing idea concerning the relation of the state to the
-P-A-G-E-233
  THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 205 
schools in Switzerland as well as in other countries. The eighteenth 
century generally considered the state’s duty to consist essentially in 
organizing public order and securing safety; civilizing agencies such 
as public education, were thought to lie outside the pale of the state, 
and given over into the hands of the church, securing only the state’s 
natural right of supervision. The state’s budget was in no wise 
adapted to maintain and promote education. The conviction that it 
was the moral duty of the state to provide means for schools, was lack- 
ing entirely; and we have eloquent proofs of the fact, that the imperial 
decree, dated Vienna, October 13, 1770, which characterized the school. 
system to be a “politicum,” was considered novel and revolutionary. 
The idea of using public lands for school purposes and for raising 
means for their support, was considered wrong, “one which no well- 
wishing citizen would ever entertain” (words of Antistes Ulrich of 
Ziivich in his memorial on improving the rural schools, 1776). Hence 
voluntary contributions for the purchase of urgent necessities were 
called for and liberally spent, but of course were inadequate for a 
thorough reform of the whole system, This patchwork with insuffi- 
cient means, attempted with the best of intentions and good will, was 
going on when the great revolution took place that shattered the 
ancient confederation and erected in its place a unified State, “The 
Helvetian Republic, one and indivisible.” : 
©.—THE PERIOD OF CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT, 1798-1803. 
The French revolution abruptly changed the conception of the rela- 
tion between state and school. It was a natural consequence of its 
current, directed as it was, against the church, and wherever the revo- 
lutionary ideas entered, the school became a subject of governmental 
concern. To this was added another consideration: Therevolntion felt 
in the very beginning theneed of giving expression to the humane prin- 
ciples of the era of enlightenment in which it had its origin, and of 
replacing the traditional and historically developed, but always inade- 
quate social and political institutions, with finished, systematic consti- 
tutions. It would have been a disavowal of its most ideal aspirations, 
if it had not recognized the duty of enlightening the citizens, and hence 
earing for public education of the young. 
Switzerland also, which was remodeled in 1798 into a unified state 
according to the French model, adopted a constitution which expressed 
the principles mentioned, that is, that the state assumed the duty of 
enlightenment and public education. The first draft of the constitution 
(an imitation of the French directorial constitution) written by Peter 
Ochs in 1798, sounded rather theoretical and abstract: 
ArticLE 4, The two bases of the public weal are security and enlightenment. 
Enlightenment is preferable to wealth. 
- But the constitution opened a chance for the appointment of a min- 
ister of arts and sciences, and how abidingly this man has impressed
-P-A-G-E-234
    206. EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
public consciousness with the state’s duty toward education, may be 
seen from the fact, that all subsequent constitutions and drafts of con- 
stitutions (for they were changed frequently) during the time of cen- 
tralized government, touch upon education strongly. 
Under the most difficult circumstances, at a time when Switzerland 
was the seat of wars carried on by foreign powers, and face to face 
with destitution and misery, and at a time, moreover, when fierce 
internal political contests made abiding order impossible, the founda- 
tion of a national Swiss school system was to be established... And it 
was done. The “directorium” (executive) appointed, May, 1798, a 
minister of arts and sciences, Mr. Phillip Albrecht Stapfer, of Brugg. 
‘When he in 1800 was sent to Paris as ambassador of Switzerland his 
successor, Mr. Melchior Mohr, of Lucerne, continued Stapfer’s work in 
the direction in which it was begun. Stapfer’s leading idea was: “We 
must prove to the world that from our revolution arises a gain for true 
human culture.” 
As early as November 18, 1798, the Government (directorium) sub- 
mitted to the legislative council a bill concerning the lower city schools, 
which bill had been prepared by Stapfer, who aimed at a uniform system 
of elementary people’s schools for the whole country. These elementary 
schools he intended to lead up to a system of intermediate or citizens’ 
schools, over which should be placed the reorganized classical second- 
ary schools, and as apex to the pyramid he designed a national central 
school for higher education. The bill was read and discussed for the 
first tine in the spring of 1799, was then referred to a committee; and 
there was neglected. 
Nevertheless, Stapfer began the work of reorganization with a will. 
He was empowered by the executive to take the most necessary 
measures toward reform, hence elections were ordered for cantonal 
educational councilors (state commissioners) and school inspectors, 
and Stapfer, with the permission of the executive, issued instructions 
for these officials. These instructions are a beautiful monument not 
only of his enthusiasm and pedagogical insight, but also’of his honest 
endeavors to win over public opinion in favor of school reform, without 
regard to politics, by perfect candor in reference to his own ideas and 
by a sympathetic consideration of every suggestion arising from interest 
in public education. His instructions are conspicuous by an utter 
absence of bureaucratic flavor.” They have reference to things the 
importance of which only the present time has learned to value, as, for 
instance, control of hygienic measures. 
In order to obtain a clear statement of the conditions of the Swiss 
schools he had printed a circular letter, in 1799, containing a number 
of plain questions. The letter was sent to every school-teacher in 
Switzerland. During the year 1800 the replies arrived with few excep- 
tions. They form an invaluable source of information concerning the- 
condition of the schools at that time. Stapfer maderepeated endeavors

to establish professional courses for teachers. and supported and aided 
his secretary, Fischer, in Castle Burgdorf in his efforts at elevating the 
teachers. _He it was, also, who by constant reminders induced the 
central Government to aid Pestalozzi in his enterprises. 
Itis one of the best features of the Helvetian Government that, though it at 
times failed to know where to get the money for the most pressing needs, it backed 
Pestalozzi with firm confidence. The appropriations for the orphan asylum in 
Stans were ample. For his attempts in the elementary school at Burgdorf the Goy- 
ernment paid Pestalozzi a small salary; he owed to this same Government the 
security with which he could pursue his educational experiments, by having the free 
use of the castle at Burgdorf. The Government aided him further financially in pre- 
paring candidates for the teacher’s profession, that is, with asum quite considerable 
in comparison with other appropriations, Thissame Helvetian central Government, 
during the last few montis of its existence in 1803 enabled Pestalozzi to publish his 
schoolbooks by paying him a handsome subsidy. It acted as a godfather to Pesta- 
lozzi’s work, and whatever was free from the dross of politicai confusion during this 
Helvetian period, its genuine ideal aspiration has been saved for future generations 
by Pestalozzi; it has subsequently become a positive gain for Switzerland and the 
whole of humanity. 
The Helvetian Government laid at least certain foundations upon 
which the future could build. Its resolutions of December 4-6, 1800, 
prescribed that every community should be obliged to furnish a sehool- 
room and the proper amount of fuel to keep school open during the 
_ winter, and to pay a teacher a salary of at least 80 francs per annum. 
Compulsory education was decreed, making it the duty of every father 
to send his children and wards t6 school during the winter. 
D.—THE NAPOLEONIC ERA, 1803-1813. THE TIME OF MEDIATION, 
The seed planted by the Helvetian centralized Government began to 
germinate during the quiet decade following the overthrow of. that Gov- 
ernment and the adoption of a constitution March 10, 1803, which 
decentralized the union and made of it what it formerly was, a confed- 
eration of states. Now that the form of unity was broken, the men who 
had served Stapfer as lieutenants began to agitate the school question 
in the separate states or cantons. Most of the school laws passed by 
the legislative bodies of the cantons, and the regulations decreed by 
the various executive authorities, all are characterized by the idea that 
the care for the education of the young is “ indispensable and one of the 
highest objects of the state,” “a holy duty of the government.” It had 
become obvious that the idea of the state’s neutrality in matters of 
public education, prevalent before 1798, was untenable. 
However, the amiounts that the states thought themselves able to 
spend for the school system were measured out very economically. All 
the greater was the enthusiasm of private citizens. A great number of 
institutions arose in cities and in the country for the purpose of affording 
the sons.of well to-do families a better education than hitherto. Pesta- 
lozzi’s educational enterprise at Yverdun became popular and very suc- 
cessful. It soon became the place of pilgrimage for native and foreign
-P-A-G-E-236
208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  educators. In HofwylFellenberg established that system of institutions 
in which he hoped to conjure the threatening social crisis by means of 
better education of all classes of society. In Freiburg Pater Girard sue- 
ceeded, through the charm of his personality and the clearness of his 
method, in elevating the city schools to a degree of perfection which 
enabled them to compete with Yverdun. 
Rural pastors, prompted by the supreme need of well-prepared 
teachers, established professional courses for them; these courses 
proved to be remarkably beneficial if the circumstances of the time are 
considered. Higher education also took part in this patriotic revival, 
partly by the foundation of vigorous state (cantonal) schools (such as 
in Aarau and Chur). Finally, Pestalozzi sueceeded in founding the 
Swiss Educational Association. It met first in 1808 in Lenzburg, and 
brought together many men who had hitherto worked single-handed 
- in their respective localities, and this society became the central source 
of educational enthusiasm for Switzerland. When in 1812 its fifth 
annual meeting adjourned the members were filled with the joyous 
hope of a blessed time of peace and progress, and had no foreboding of 
the terrific events that were to take place in Europe in 1813, events 
which not only overthrew Napoleon and readjusted the map of Europe, 
but ended abruptly the activity of the Swiss Educational Association 
as well as the blessed time of mediation in Switzerland. 
E.—THE TIME OF RESTORATION, 1813-1830. 
The downfall of Napoleon led to a reorganization of the political 
institutions of Switzerland, which reorganization found approval very 
slowly. The sovereignty of the cantons was reestablished in almost 
absolute form. The Federation was now a powerless union of states, 
though Wallis, Neuenburg, and Geneva were added permanently. After 
all the efforts and restless activity exhibited during the Napoleonic era, 
the desire for rest made itself felt very strongly, and characterized the 
following years as a period of conservative standstill and occasional 
retrogression that met no opposition in public opinion. However, the 
plans for reforming the school system had too well matured and taken 
root in public consciousness during the previous period to check a 
gradual development along the whole line or undo the work already 
~ accomplished. Only in one point an unquestionable step backward 
was taken in some cantons by withdrawing the State’s centralized 
maintenance of the school and by giving into the hands of the clergy 
the work of supervision. Moreover, the famine years of 1816 and 1817 
pressed material interests into the foreground. 
The year 1819 witnessed a shifting of scenery, and the revolution of 
the Greeks, for whom much sympathy was manifested in Switzerland, 
strengthened the liberal spirit of a great part of the Swiss people. 
Most of the veterans of the time of the Helvetian union and the 
Napoleonic era were still alive. The Swiss Society for the Common 
Weal, founded in 1810, accepted the inheritance of the defunet Swiss
-P-A-G-E-237
  THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 209 
Edueational Association, and became the debating club of all who aimed 
at a liberal development in public education. With great interest and 
the far-reaching approval of public opinion, the question of better pro- 
fessional preparation of teachers was discussed. By adopting, upon 
the advice of P. Girard, the Bell-Lancasterian method of mutual instrue- 
tion, it was hoped that a temporary solution had been found of the 
problem of how to extend general elementary education, with very lim- 
ited means, into the poorer cantons and country places. In a few can- 
tons the efforts toward school reform crystallized into laws. Nidwalden 
passed a new school law in 1829 and Luzern in 1830. Ziirich had been 
occupied for several years with a careful revision of its school system 
and had completed the draft of a new law in its essential features when 
the July revolution in France (1830) created an entirely new situation. 
F.—THE PERIOD OF REGENERATION, 1830-1848. 
It was 4 peculiar turn the revolutionary movement of 1830 took in 
the land of its origin, by being checked by the educated and cultured 
classes of the citizens and prevented from degenerating into anarchism. 
This spectacle of victory of culture over wild excesses was repeated in 
Switzerland. Revolution became reform. The more or less patriarchal 
organization of the State was replaced by a conscious formation of the 
State based upon law (Rechtstaat). This influenced the school in two 
directions. First, the State claimed the exclusive right to organize 
the school, and hence assumed the unlimited duty to maintain it. By 
taxing the people directly for school purposes the possibility for radical 
reforms was opened, and the makeshift resorted to during the twenties, 
i. e., to accomplish a general popular education by means of mutual 
instruction and the use of pupil teachers, was now discontinued. It 
soon disappeared completely from the Swiss schools. Secondly, the 
efforts in behalf of carrying into effect the principle of equality before 
the law resulted in doing away with the differences between city and 
rural schools, citizens? schools, and schools for the poor. The division 
line between classical (or secondary) and elementary schools, also, was 
felt very acutely, and the desire to connect organically all institutions 
of learning became the leading motive of the reformers. Upon this 
basis the third decade created the modern unified common school, an 
organism which begins with the primary school and leads the child up 
through intermediate and secondary schools to the university or poly- 
technicum, ‘The entire system is one organism, managed and super- 
vised by the different cantons, but essentially the same all over 
Switzerland, a system fashioned very much like our American common 
school, the graduate of which may enter college and subsequently the 
university. 
This development took place within cantonal jurisdiction. The school 
was, and is now, considered strictly a state or cantonal concern. The 
ED 92——14  
-P-A-G-E-238
210 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  federal government had no jurisdiction in school matters, for the ob- 
stactes in the way of replacing the federal agreement of 1815 by a consti- 
tution that provided for closer centralization, were still too formidable. 
The draft of a new constitution drawn up between 1832 and 1834, for 
instance, was rejected. It did not mention the schools at all. The 
movement during this time in behalf of granting the federal govern- 
ment power to establish a federal university, failed signally, and ended 
in the establishment of several universities by cantonal governments 
(Ziixich in 1833, Berne in 1834). Partial reactions, long cotitinued con- 
fusion and conflict, even civil war, had to be overcome before the possi- 
bility was opened of changing the loose aggregation of sovereign states 
into a federation of states with a strong federal or central government, 
which was enabled to act as the determinative power in matters con- 
cerning institutions for the development of culture and public educa- 
tion. 
As a inatter of self-evidence, each canton has its own history of pub- 
lic education during this period of regeneration. In some cantons the 
political waves were soon smoothed, and the united efforts of the better 
educated classes sacceeded in creating a well-planned school system 
that was able to withstand attacks. In other cantons party differences 
prevented a similar establishment for many years, and the rivalry of 
the leading persons constantly hindered or checked the development 
of the school system upon a modern basis. In other cantons, again, 
the ideals at first accepted remained on paper and failed to be incor- 
porated in actual institutions; only gradually measures were taken 
which proved the growth of the seeds planted. In still other cantons 
the reactionary opposition against the spirit of modern times succeeded 
in opposing all liberal movements. One school organization only, that 
of Ziirich, became important as an example for other cantons and was 
imitated by several. 
Switzerland possessed in the works of Pestalozzi, Fellenberg, and P. 
Girard a most significant pedagogical past of its own. All the more 
astonishing it is to notice that the Ziirich school system, inaugurated 
during the thirties, which system was partly copied by other cantons, 
is not constructed upon the lines laid down by these men. When an 
educational leader was to be chosen a candidate from among the dis- 
ciples of Pestalozzi was rejected, and a man from Wiirtemberg, 
Thomas Scherr, was selected to direct the professional training of teach- 
ers. He had. been principal of a blind asylum, and now became the 
principal of the cantonal normal school in Ziirich; as such he exerted 
his influence most beneficially over the whole school system of the can- 
ton, which to this day bears the characteristic features this admirable 
man imprinted upon it. 
The Catholic cantons did not call upon P. Girard, but upon Scherr, 
to ask for advice in the reconstruction of their school systems, whilein 
Berne, Fellenberg, whose institution in Hofwyl was then flourishing,
-P-A-G-E-239
  THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 211 
but who was engaged in bitter controversies with members of the can- 
tonal government, lost all influence upon the reorganization of the 
school system of this canton. -Thus we see Pestalozzi, Fellenberg, and 
P. Girard disregarded. It is true the ideasof Fellenberg found practi- 
cal realization through his coworker Wehrli, who was called to the head 
of the normal school in Kreuzlingen, in Thurgau, and whose work 
was very beneficial to the schools of the whole canton; but twenty 
years later Thomas Scherr, as president of the board of education in 
Thurgau, succeeded in removing this last opponent also (1853). The 
French part of Switzerland does not exhibit a single example of per- 
sonal influence upon the schools such as Scherr’s... His influence 
exerted itself over entire German Switzerland, and the Swiss schools of 
to-day are still exhibiting Scherr’s ground plan. 
And, indeed, Scherr’s common school was a masterpiece of its time. 
The main features that characterized it were, the simplicity of its organi- 
zation; consistent restriction of its programme to intellectual. educa- 
tion; excellent, methodical skill displayed, especially in the primary 
grades; a lavish equipment with a complete and carefully graded set 
of appliances; the fact that it vigorously maintained its independence 
from the clergy; care for the rights, social position, and material inter- 
ests of the teaching profession, as well as consideration for its corpora- 
tive self-respect; above all, in everything it undertook it wisely limited 
itself to that which was possible and attainable. 
Of course the system was not without its defects. Subsequent 
years have changed, supplemented, and improved it. The length of 
school age has been extended, the methods of instruction have been 
improved, new branches of instruction introduced ; yet, essentially, 
the fundamental lines laid down by Scherr have remained the same, 
although to-day other conceptions of the object and method of school 
education are advocated, Frébel’s kindergarten, manual training, and 
school games are claiming admission, and demands for concentration 
of the matter of instruction are heard; thus the foundation of Scherr’s 
plan is put in question, and we stand in the midst of a contest that may 
take many years before it will be definitely decided. 
G.—FROM 1848 TILL THE PRESENT TIME. 
The federal constitution of 1848 was framed in accordance with the 
principle that centralization should be restricted to absolutely neces- 
sary measures, hence the organization of the school system was left, as 
heretofore, to the separate cantons. The constitution does not even 
claim a general supervision over the schools, and in article 22 it restricts 
the Government’s functions solely to the establishment of a university 
and a polytechnic school. During the debates from 1852 to 1854, with 
reference to certain amendments, the word and was changed to or, and 
the question then decided in favor of a polytechnicum. In 1854 the 
Federal Polytechnic University in Ziirich was opened.
-P-A-G-E-240
212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  The cantons or separate states, on the other hand, progressed in 
developing their school systems in proportion to their political and 
intellectual progress. The most conservative of the cantons, induced 
by the great strides the liberal cantons made in popular education, has- 
tened to replace the regulations and school laws that dated from the 
period of mediation (1803-1813) and shunned no sacrifices or efforts 
to regain their rank. New laws were enacted that expressed the views 
of modern times. When at the beginning of the seventies a revision 
of the constitution for the purpose of strengthening the central gov- 
ernment was called for, the soil for such a procedure was much better 
prepared than in 1848; indeed, federal provision for school education 
was now a thing which seemed quite plausible. The revised constitu- 
tion of 1872 did not find the sanction of the majority of the people, but 
the one of 1874 did. It contains a number of articles referring to 
public education which were adopted by a large majority of the popu- 
lation April 19, 1874. These articles are worth quoting: 
(1) The Federal Government is empowered to establish or subsidize, beside the 
federal polytechnic school, a university, and other higher institutions of learning. 
(2) The separate cantons are obliged to offer children of school age sufficient ele- 
mentary instruction, which shall remain exclusively under cantonal supervision. It 
is to be obligatory and gratuitous in public schools. 
(3) The public schools shall be open to the members of any religious denomina- 
tion without detriment to their liberty of faith and conscience. 
(4) The Federal Government shall institute the necessary proceedings against any 
canton that fails to conform to the foregoing requirements. 
      The wording of these articles allowed several interpretations. One 
point was left undecided, namely, whether the Federal Government 
has the duty, or only the right, to regulate by law the relations insti- 
tuted by the constitution between it and the school system. In 1882 
the Federal Council (the legislative body) determined upon the creation 
of the position of permanent secretary of education (state or federal 
commissioner). However, when the law was submitted to a popular 
vote, as all laws have to be in Switzerland, it was rejected by a majority 
of more than two-thirds. Hence the Federal Government was obliged 
to restrict its influence and aid in behalf of popular education to insti- 
tutions that are not in any way infringing upon the established ean- 
tonalinstitutions. At present it subsidizes the school museums exist- 
ing since 1876; and in late years it also aids materially, by subsidies 
and control, the industrial and agricultural (since 1884) and the com- 
mercial schools (since 1889). 
The present Swiss military organization has afforded the Federal 
Government an opportunity (since 1875) for arranging examinations 
for army recruits; it also has issued regulations with regard to gym- 
nastic institutions for the male youth, and the preparation of gym- 
nastic teachers. In accordance with article 33 of the constitution the 
medical examinations are uniformly regulated by the Federal Govern- 
ment, and inspection of secondary schools leading up to the study of
-P-A-G-E-241
  THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. ke 
medicine has been assumed by the Government as a consequence of the 
former duty. In accordance with article 34 a law has been passed for- 
bidding the employment in factories of children below 14 years of age 
(1877). This law also provides that for young people between 14 and 16 
years the necessary attendance in continuation schools or courses is to 
be included in the normal work-day, which is restricted to eleven hours. 
The organization of the entire system of secondary schools and higher 
education (exclusive of the Federal polytechnic university, medical exam- 
inations, which influence the preparatory schools, and subsidies, which 
affect industrial, agricultural, and commercial schools) is left to the 
cantons, as is also that of the elementary-school system (exclusive of 
gymnastics for boys) in accordance with article 27. Since 1880, all the 
cantons have inserted into their constitutions provisions referring to 
public education and have passed laws to execute these provisions, 
which, though in every case specific, are by no means uniform. 
I].—PRESENT CONDITION OF THE SWISS SCHOOLS. 
A.—SCHOOL ORGANIZATION. 
I.—THE ELEMFNTARY SCHOOL. 
Purpose and extent.—In expressing the object of the elementary or 
people’s school, the various cantonal school laws exhibit two distinct 
currents: Some say it 1s the object of the school to educate the whole 
child, while others claim that the school has the sole purpose of giving 
instruction. 
The first definition was adopted by Scherr. The Ziirich school law 
of 1832 says: 
The people's school shall train the children of all classes of society, according to 
uniform principles, to become intellectually active, civilly useful, and morally good 
men and women.

Innerrhoden (1875), Schwyz (1877), Nidwalden (1879), and Schaffhausen 
(1879) express the object of school education. 
Very much differently sounds the law in Oberwalden (1876), to wit: 
Every community shall see to it that all its children of school age attend an ele- 
mentary school that offers the knowledge necessary for common life. 
The law in Luzern (1879) says: 
The primary and continuation schools are designed to give, in connection with 
the parental home, a training such as is generally considered essential for life. 
The law in Baselstadt (1880) defines the object of the elementary 
school to be, “'To make its pupils familiar with elementary knowledge.” 
The other cantons do not define the purpose of the school at all, hence 
are indirectly allied with the second group. Oberwalden and Freiburg 
state in their constitutions that “school education shall be conducted
-P-A-G-E-242

  214 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
‘in areligious and patriotic spirit;” they also secure to the clergy a legal 
influence upon school education. 
The length of school age is not uniform in Switzerland. The uni- 
form part is the medium age between 6 and 15 years, embracing 
six to nine courses. In the cantons Freiburg, Aargau, Tessin, Vaud, 
Neuenburg, and Geneva a prescholastic course, kindergarten or mater- 
nal school, is part of the legal organization of the elementary school, 
but attendance in these prescholastic institutions is not obligatory, 
except in Neuenburg and Geneva, where the upper grade of the infant 
school is also the lowest grade of the obligatory elementary school. At 
the close of the elementary school everywhere in Switzerland efforts 
are made to keep the boys and girls at their studies, by means of vol- 
untary or obligatory continuation schools, review courses for army 
recruits, etc.. Thus an extension of school work to the eighteenth or 
twentieth year of age is aimed at and successfully secured. 3 
The schools for children of customary school age (6 to 15) are organ- 
ized as follows: 
(a) The elementary or primary school (6 to 11), attendance in which 
is obligatory; and it is everywhere open all the year round. 
(0) The intermediate or grammar school, for pupils who do not intend 
to enter secondary schools. As a rule this intermediate department has 
two branches. (1) An advanced elementary school, attendance being 
voluntary and the course extending over four years. It is variously 
ealled district, real, and secondary school (not.to be mistaken for 
American secondary schools). (2) A simple continuation of the 
elementary school, commonly open only half-day and in most places 
organized in form of obligatory continuation schools. 
The duty of attending school begins at the close of the sixth year of 
age, or aS near that age as is convenient, in Ziirich, Berne, Glarus, 
Zug, Baselstadt, Baselland, Schaffhausen, both Appenzells, St. Gall, 
Thurgau, Tessin, Neuenburg, and Geneva. In all other cantons the 
limit is the completed seventh year of age. Admission takes place in 
spring in most cantons; in Appenzell and Geneva in August; in Uri, 
Graubiinden, Tessin, and Wallis in the fall, because in these cantons 
schools are almost exclusively winter schools. For schools of six 
grades in Luzerne, pupils are admitted at 7 years also. 
- The duty of attending school extends over six to nine years, namely: 
Six years in Ziirich, Uri, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Zug, Baselland, 
Appenzelli. Rh.; six to seven years in Luzern; seven years in Schwyz, 
Glarus, Appenzell.a, Rh., St. Gall, Neuenburg and Geneva; eight 
years in Baselstadt, Schaffhausen, Aargau, Tessin, and Wallis; eight 
to nine years in Freiburg, Solothurn, Graubiinden, and Thurgau; nine 
years in Berne and. Vaud. 
Counting the half years of required attendance, we range the can- 
tons as follows: 6, Uri; 8, Tessin and Wallis; 8 to 9, Graubiinden; 10 
to 12, Luzern; 12, Ziirich, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Zug, Solothurn,

Baselland; 14, Schwyz, Glarus, Appenzell a. Rh., Neuenburg, Geneva; 
15, Thurgau; 14 to 16, Schaffhausen and Aargau; 16, Baselstadt; 16 
to 18, Freiburg; 18, Berne and Vaud. The cantons Appenzell i. Rh. 
and St. Gall can not well be placed in this scale. Appenzell i. Rh. 
has in different communities, in schools of six grades, forty-two, thirty- 
six, and twenty-six school weeks, and should be credited with six to 
twelve half years. St. Gall requires seven school years, but some of 
its schools are half, others three-fourths, and still others whole-year 
schools. Hence it should be credited with seven to fourteen half years. 
Attempts have been made to classify the cantons with reference to 
the number of school weeks and hours, adding the amount of time 
required by obligatory attendance in continuation schools or courses. 
(a) Calculations of the secretary of education, Mr. Grob, in his year 
pook for 1887, group the cantons with reference to the number of 
hours spent in school: 
Group I. Uri, 3,760; Appenzell i. Rh., 4,072. 
II. Wallis, 5,440; Graubiinden, 5,600; Nidwalden, 5,784; Tessin, 5,808; 
Obwalden, 5,824; Zug, 5,919; Luzern, 5,952; Appenzell a. Rh., 5,952. 
Ul. Aargau, 6,372; Schwyz, 6,548. 
IV. Solothurn, 7,458; St. Gall, 7,644; Baselland, 7,704; Ziirich, 7,788. 
V. Schaffhausen, 8,274; Glarus, 8,418; Berne, 8,424; Freiburg, 8,466; Neuen- 
burg, 8,640. 
. VI. Thurgau, 9,148; Vaud, 9,291; Baselstadt, 9,416; Geneva, 10,136. 
(b) Calculation found in the statistical atlas prepared for the World’s 
Exposition in Paris 1889, with reference to the number of school weeks 
in the different cantons: 
Group I. Appenzell i. Rh., 178; Wallis, 202; Uri, 266; Graubiinden, 208; Luzern, 
211, 
Il. Nidwalden, 247; Appenzell a. Rh., 251; Obwalden, 258;

339, 
VY. Baselstadt and Geneva, 352; Aargau, 360; Vaud, 377.

It is well to state explicitly that these groupings have but a very 
relative value, and are subject to local and personal exceptions which 
for certain schools and groups of pupils cause considerable modifica- 
tion, but which can not be considered in calculating averages. 
If we take into the scope of the elementary school the so-called 
secondary schools, which in Switzerland mean grammar schools, and 
attendance in which is not obligatory, we have to make this brief expla- 
nation: these schools have as a rule the double object of giving a more 
general education, and likewise serve as foundation for the advanced 
schools which in America are called secondary or classical schools. 
The one branch of this bifurcated school, that which intends to com- 
plete a common school education, scarcely advances beyond the seepe 
of an elementary school. If, however, we consider the great number of
-P-A-G-E-244
216 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  pupils it has, it becomes plain why the greater attention and care is 
bestowed upon it, according to the saying, “the greatest good to the 
greatest number.” Since the fall of 1888 it has become obvious that 
this branch (the advanced common school branch) has had much to do 
with the recent intellectual high standing of the army recruits. 
This advanced grade of common schools (called upper schools in 
Berne, écoles régionales in Freiburg, continuation.schools in Aargau, 
middle schools in Appenzell a. Rh., and secondary schools in Vaud) 
is a mixture of secondary and primary schools, just as the advanced 
schools of the other cantons are mixtures of secondary schools, in the 
American sense of the word, and advanced elementary schools. There 
is no division line possible, since the differences are too numerous. 
Asarule the upper-grades of the common school of nearly all cities 
and towns have a mixed character, and it simply depends upon the 
personal leaning of the pupil or the inclination of his parents to decide 
in what direction he is to progress. 
(d) Classification of schools.—The limits of the different grades, as 
well as their definition, is different in the various cantons; just so the 
age at which the advanced common schools and real secondary schools 
branch off from the simple elementary schools. Still they may be 
grouped for purposes of classification in three distinct types: 
(1) The general common school with a course of six to seven years 
followed by an advanced school, one branch of which leads into the 
secondary and preparatory school for universities: Ziirich, Luzern, 
Uri, Schwyz, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Glarus, Zug, Freiburg, Solothurn, 
Baselland, both the Appenzells, St. Gall, Graubiinden, Thurgau, Wal- 
lis, Neuenburg, Geneva. 
(2) Unified organization of the entire elementary school with the 
lougest possible course, but with an early bifurcation of the upper 
grades into advanced elementary and real secondary schools: Berne, 
Schaffhausen, Aargau, Tessin, Vaud. 
(3) Bifurcation of the simple and advanced common school in the 
middle of the course, that is, after four or five years’ study: Baselstadt. 
The primary grades are everywhere taught by class teachers. 
Sometimes all the children of school age in a small place are taught 
by. one teacher (ungraded school). In more populous places they are 
graded and taught by several teachers (graded schools), or the children 
of a community are separated according to location and sex (parallel 
schools). 
Most cantons have legal enactments concerning the maximum num- 
ber of pupils. When that is exceeded a parallelizing takes place in 
the primary grades. The following maxima are observed: Baselland, 
120; Ziirich, 100; resp., 80; Solothurn, St. Gall, Aargau, and Thurgau, 
80; Berne, Luzern, and Schwyz, 80 in graded, 70 in ungraded schools; 
Freiburg, 70; Glarus, 70 in all day, 50 in half-day schools; Uri, 70 
under one teacher; Schaffhausen, 70 under several teachers, 60 under    
 
-P-A-G-E-245
Z 
THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 217 
one teacher; Zug, Tessin, Nidwalden, 60 under one teacher; Wallis, 
60 (when 50 pupils the girls must be separated); Baselstadt, 52 in pri- 
mary grades, 45 in advanced grades; Neuenburg, Vaud, and Geneva, 
50. Some cantons also state the maximum for advancel coimmon 
schools. When that is reached or exceeded a division is considered 
necessary. Thus, Ziirich, 50 (provisionally 35); Luzern, 45; Baselstadt, 
45; Berne, 30. 
ik anes the schools some cantons, especially in Catholic Switzer- 
land, exhibit a decided tendency toward separation of the sexes, nota- 
bly in larger cities. The proportion of schools containing both sexes in 
1881 was as follows: In Appenzell i. Rh., 66-6 per cent; Nidwalden, 61 
per cent; Uri, 57-1 per cent; Neuenburg, 56-4 per eens Freiburg, Bae 
per fea Relays 50-9 per cent; Tessin, 43 per cent; Zug, 38-6 per 
cent; Geneva, 36-6 per cent; Wallis, 35:3 per cent; Obwalden, 28-9 per 
cent; Baselstadt, 9-4 per cent; while all or nearly all primary schools 
were mixed in Glarus, 100 per cent; Thurgau, 100 per cent; Appenzell 
a. Rh., 99 per cent; Baselland, 98-4 per cent. 
In the advanced common schools both the system of class teachers 
and special teachers are found. The tendency toward: dividing the 
instruction among special teachers is the result of the peculiar special 
examinations for teachers (Ziirich and Berne); partly also of legal 
requirements that such schools should have, at least two or three teach- 
ers (Freiburg. Solothurn, Baselland, and Aargau.) 
(ce) Course of study.—The branches of study in the primary and 
continuation schools (primary and grammar grades, as we are accus- 
tomed to term them) are as follows: 
(1) Reading and writing of the mother tongue with the aid of object 
and colloquial lessons. 
(2) Arithmetic and geometry.—The latter is not taught in Uri, 
Schwyz, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Zug, Appenzell a. Rh., Neuenburg, 
Wallis (as to girls), and it is optional with the teachers in Freiburg 
and Tessin. 
(3) History and geography, of Switzerland only, in Luzern, Uri, 
Schwyz, Nidwalden, Solothurn, Appenzell i. Rh., Graubiinden, Tessin, 
Geneva; restricted thus only in the minimum requirements in Berne 
and Freiburg; history alone restricted to Swiss history in Obwalden, 
Glarus, Zug, Appenzell a. Rh., Aargau (exclusive of continuation 
schools), Wallis and Neuenburg; general geography optional for schools 
of Tessin. 
(4) Natural history is not taught in Luzern, Uri, Obwalden, Nid- 
walden, Appenzell a. Rh., Wallis, Neuenburg, and is left to the discre- 
tion of the teacher in the schools of Freiburg and Tessin. 
(5) Penmanship. 
(6) Singing, optional in the schools of Uri. 
(7). Drawing, optional in the schools of Uri, while it is restricted to- 
free-hand drawing in Freiburg, and restricted tte instrumental drawing  
-P-A-G-E-246
  218 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
in Tessin. Drawing is not taughtin Obwalden, Nidwalden, Appenzell 
a Rh., and Wallis; while in the schools of Tessin and Nidwalden draw- 
ing is taught to the pupils of school age in separate voluntary drawing 
schools. 
(8) Female handiwork is optional in Uri. 
(9) Gymnastics, only for boys in Uri, Schwyz, Nidwalden, Freiburg, 
Appenzell a. Rh., Tessin; optional for girls in Berne and Luzern. No 
legal enactments concerning gymnastics are in existence in Appenzell i. 
Rh., and Graubiinden; but federal laws prescribe gymnastics for all 
the male youth over 10 years of age in every canton. 
(10) Religion is.a study optional with the parents according to the 
federal constitution. It is placed entirely outside of the pale of the 
public school organization in Neuenburg and Geneva, while in Luzern, © 
Uri, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Catholic Freiburg, and Vaud, the respon; 
sibility is shared with the church and the clergy. In the cantons of 
Solothurn and Appenzell i. Rh., religion is taught without reference to 
denominational distinctions. 
To the foregoing regular branches must be added some special 
branches: 
. (1) Bookkeeping in Berne, Schwyz, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Glarus, 
Solothurn, Graubiinden, Aargau, Thurgau, Wallis, but only optional 
in the schools of Freiburg and Tessin. 
(2) Hygiene in Solothurn, in the girls’ industrial schools of Neuen- 
burg, and optional in Tessin. 
(3) Science of government in Freiburg, Vaud, Wallis, Neuenburg, 
and Geneva; optional in Tessin. 
(4) Arboriculture in Obwalden, elements of political economy in Neu- 
enburg, agriculture in Geneva; also in some communities in Vaud. 
5) Domestic economy for girls in Freiburg, Solothurn, St. Gall, Vaud, 
Neuenburg, and Geneva. 
(6) Manual training for boys in Vaud, Neuenburg, and Geneva. 
(7) Aforeign language in Graubiinden (German for Romanie children), 
Baselstadt (French), Geneva (German); optional in Berne, Luzern, 
Aargau, and Nenenburg. 
In the cantons of Berne, Freiburg, and Tessin, a double course is in 
operation, carried through by every school, and resulting later on in 
the bifurcation spoken of heretofore. 
The advanced elementary school differs principally from the simple 
elementary schoo! in its obligatory teaching of a foreign tongue. The 
branches of study in this kind of schools are: 
Mother tongue, one or two foreign languages and arithmetic, mostly 
in connection with bookkeeping; geométry, optional only in Tessin and 
Wallis; in Luzern also for girls; geography and history; some cantons 
restrict these branches to geography and history of Switzerland exclu- 
sively, with science of government, natural history, and science, sing- 
ing, drawing (in Wallis only for boys), penmanship (in Tessin only for
-P-A-G-E-247
THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 219 
  boys), gymnastics (obligatory for all boys between 10 and 15; in Aargau 
the use of arms is obligatory); religion, as above stated. 
To these regular branches the following are added as obiigatory 
branches: Manual training for boys in Geneva; female handiwork for 
girls in Luzern, Schwyz, Tessin, Zug, Solothurn, Baselstadt, Schaff- 
hausen, St. Gall, Graubiinden, Aargau, Tessin, Vaud, Wallis, Neuen- 
burg, Geneva; domestic economy in Luzern, Schwyz, Tessin, Vaud, 
Neuenburg, and Geneva: horticulture in Tessin; pedagogies in Neuen- 
burg and Geneva. ; 
Optional studies are: Ancient and modern languages in Ziirich; 
exercises under arms in Berne, Vaud, and Neuenburg; elements of 
physies and chemistry and free-hand drawing in Freiburg; commercial 
branches in Baselstadt and Geneva; instrumental music in Aargau; 
agriculture and hygiene in Wallis. 
As a rule these advanced elementary schools have the double pur- 
pose of offering a more complete general education, and also of acting as 
a foundation for the higher institutions, such as classical schools; they 
are considered decentralizing parallel institutions for the lower classes 
of the real secondary, or centralized cantonal schools. It is plain, there: 
fore, that these advanced elementary schools fashion their courses of 
study in some cantons after those of the lower grades of secondary 
schools. 
In some cantons the study of vocal music is carried beyond school 
age and taught in separate singing schools (Ziirich, Baselland, and 
Thurgau). 
Schools for Female Handiwork.—Female handiwork is taught either 
as a branch of the course in elementary schools, or treated in separate 
institutions, intimately related to the elementary schools. The more 
populous cantons arrange from time to time courses for the training of 
teachers for that branch. 
Manual Training for Boys.—This is an integral part of the programme 
of normal school education in the cantons of Berne, Tessin, Vaud, 
Neuenburg, and Geneva; in the last three cantons it is introduced 
in the elementary school and is obligatory in Geneva. In Vaud and 
Neuenburg the introduction of manual training is left to the local 
school authorities, who receive a cantonal subsidy if they introduce it. 
Tn all the other cantons, it is left to the initiative of private persons and 
societies; in Thurgau it is subsidized by the government, but not 
directed. In 1891 manual training was given to boys in the cantons of 
Ziixich (9 schools), Berne (15), Nidwalden (1), Glarus (2), Freiburg (4), 
Solothurn (3), Baselstadt (2, of which one has 29 classes and 538 
pupils), Schaffhausen (7), St. Gall (6), Graubiinden (3), Aargau (3), 
Thurgau (4), Vaud (2), and Neuenburg (4). The Swiss Society for the 
Promotion of Manual Training arranges annual courses for the training 
of teachers and issues regulatious for their examination. 
Continuation Schools.—The pupil’s age at which these schools begin 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  220 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  their work is not uniformly fixed, since the term, continuation school, 
is used for obligatory supplementary schools for children past school 
age, as well as for advanced elementary schools for children within 
school age (7 to 15). Besides these obligatory and voluntary schools 
there are many other institutions under different names, as industrial, 
drawing, trade, Sunday, evening, repetition, supplementary, and tech- 
nical schools, all of which deserve to be classed among the contin- 
uation schools. Prof. Hunziker takes the term to mean, all schools 
which young people of both sexes attend for a certain number of hours 
per week or day, after completing an elementary course, either for the 
purpose of retaining or improving their general education, or of gain- 
ing knowledge and skill necessary for the occupation or trade they 
have chosen. 
For the boys the Swiss continuation schools may be grouped in three 
classes, which are rarely found in their original state: 
(a) Schools for the purpose of technical, industrial, or agricultural 
training. These schools have, in the nature of the case, voluntary 
attendance. They are organized to fit special technical needs; hence 
we see them provided with special institutions, such as workshops, ete., 
in order to facilitate practical skill in trades or occupations. 
(b) Schools for the purpose of supplementing general edueation 
between the ages of 15 and 20, Their character and management favor 
obligatory attendance which, in some cases, is decreed by local author- 
ities. 
(¢) Schools for those who have not become proficient in the branches 
taught ‘n the regular elementary schools. These schools aim at securing 
the mivmum of education necessary for civil life. In order to gain 
their e.d it is necessary that instruction in them be obligatory. 
A review of the entire system of continuation schools of Switzer- 
land gives the following results: 
(1) No canton is without continuation schools. 
(2) One canton only (Appenzell i. Rh.) is without a legal enactment 
concerning continuation schools upon which the school authorities 
could base the institution. 
(3) Voluntary continuation schools only are found in Ziirich, Berne, 
Glarus, Baselstadt, Graubiinden, Geneva, Appenzell a. Rh., St. Gall, 
and Aargau. In the last three cantons some communities have insisted 
upon obligatory attendance. 
(4) Insome cantons obligatory attendance has been carried through 
conditionally—that is to say, in Schaffhausen for all who have not com- 
pleted a full eight years’ course in an elementary school; in Luzern 
for all who have not spent at least one year in the advanced elementary 
school. In Schwyz, Freiburg, Tessin, and Neuenburg the obligatory 
attendance depends upon the failure in examination for admission. 
(5) The obligatory continuation schools of the cantons Uri, Schwyz, 
Obwalden, Nidwalden, Zug, Freiburg, Appenzell i. Rh., Tessin, and
-P-A-G-E-249
THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 221 
  Wallis are only review courses for army recruits; in Tessin and Wallis. 
these courses are combined with the general repetition school, while 
Luzern, side by side with its obligatory continuation schools, has, in 
a number of communities, special obligatory review courses for army 
recruits insufficiently prepared. Berne possesses the latter institution 
also, but attendance here is optional. 
(6) The cantons of Solothurn, Baselland, and Thurgau have oblig- 
atory continuation schools for more or less organic continuation of the 
instruction in the lower schools. 
(7) The system of continuation schools for the girls (which includes 
cooking, domestic practice, and schools for servants, etc.) has begun to 
develop during the last few decades (a) by connecting special continua- 
tion courses with girls’ secondary schools in Zug, Freiburg, Baselstadt, 
and St. Gall, or to the cantonal review schools in Ziirich; (>) in con- 
nection with women’s industrial schools in Ziirich, Baselstadt, and St. 
Gall; (c) in connection with continuation schools for boys in Ziirich, 
Glarus, Baselstadt, Neuenburg; (d) by means of special schools estab- 
lished by communities or societies and subsidized by the cantons in 
Ziirich, Berne, Luzern, Glarus, Solothurn, Appenzell a. Rh., St. Gall, 
Graubiinden, Aargau, Neuenburg, and Geneva. 
(8) Industrial continuation schools are under the supervision of the 
Federal Government and receive regular subsidies. During the scho- 
lastic year 1891 the Federal Government of Switzerland subsidized 61 
industrial schools, in which drawing and theoretical instruction was 
given; 13 in Ziirich, 10 in Berne, 2 in Schwyz, 5 in Glarus, 1 in Zug, 1 
in Freiburg, 3 in Solothurn, 1 in Baselstadt, 1 in Schaffhausen, 2 in 
Appenzell a. Rh., 2 in St. Gall, 2 in Graubiiden, 10 in Aargau, 5 in 
Thurgau, 2 in Neuenburg, 1 in Geneva. 
During the same year the Government subsidized 35 drawing 
schools—4 in Berne, 1 in Uri, 3 in Obwalden, 2 in Nidwalden, 2 in 
Freiburg, 3 in Baselland, 3 in St. Gall, 15 in Tessin, 1 in Vaud, 1 in 
Neuenburg. 
(9) Parallel with industrial continuation schools are the agricultural 
institutions; they are mostly connected with schools for the purpose of 
supplementing general education. In Wallis agriculture is taught in 
connection with elementary schools (some communities make them 
obligatory), and the promotion of arboriculture is left to the initiative 
of teachers. 
Private schools.—Side by side with public schools there are scattered 
all over Switzerland a number of private elementary and secondary 
schools, the right to teach and to open schools being granted by the Fed- 
eral constitution and the school laws of the cantons; but the cantonal 
authorities have everywhere reserved the right of supervision.   
II.—SECONDARY, TECHNICAL, AND HIGHER INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING. 
(A) Secondary schools.—As was said before, the so-called secondary 
or middle schools in Switzerland are advanced elementary schools,  
-P-A-G-E-250
  222 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  “grammar” schools in the American acceptation of the term; the 
real secondary schools—that is, those which lead up to higher seats 
of learning and correspond to our high schools and academies— 
are variously called cantonal schools, complete secondary schools, 
progymnasia, and gymnasia; again, at other places they are called 
higher schools for girls and lyceums. In this group of schools there 
is much less uniformity than in the previous group—that of elementary 
schools. They have but one point in common, namely, that their char- 
acter of secondary schools begins at the pupil’s age of 15—that is, the 
time when obligatory attendancé ceases. 
However, their courses vary in extent and duration almost as much 
as do the private secondary schools of America. Some of them lead 
up to the university, others to the polytechnicum, still others to other 
professional schools; hence the latter complete their courses sooner. 
In.some cantons these institutions are communal or private. Many of 
them are State or cantonal schools, and the latter are frequently 
brought into competition with the former, hence are stimulated to 
more vigorous activity than they might otherwise exhibit. A review 
of the statistics of the secondary system will be found in section F. 
(B) Technical schools.—These institutions may be divided into those 
that, according to age of the pupils and conditions of admission, are 
parallel with secondary schools mentioned before, and those that bear 
the character of higher institutions of learning. To the first category 
belong, above all, the teachers’ normal and training schools, which 
will be more minutely described in section E. To the same category 
belong the industrial, agricultural, and commercial schools. The list 
in 1891 contained— 
(a) Trade and industrial schools: Three technical schools, in Winter- 
thur, Biel, Burgdorf. These institutions give technical education for 
the pursuit of trades and industries. The school at Winterthur is 
famous all over Europe. 
Two weaving schools, at Ziirich and Wattwil; 8 watchmakers’ schools, 
at Biel, St. Immer, Pruntrut, Solothurn, Neuenburg, Chaux-de-T’onds, 
Locle, Geneva; 3 mechanics’ schools, at Chaux-de-Fonds, Locle, Geneva; 
1 carving school at Brienz; 7 schools for woman’s work, at Berne, Basel, 
St. Gall, Chaux-de-Fonds, Chur, Geneva, and Ziirich. 
Seven workshops, for woodwork in Ziirich; metal-workers in Winter- 
thur; joiners and shoemakers in Berne; bookbinding, basket-braiding, 
and stone-cutting in Freiburg. 
Nine art schools and institutions, for industrial art in Ziirich, con- 
nected with industrial museums; in Winterthur, connected with the 
technical school; in Berne and Biel, connected with technical schools; 
Luzern, Basel, connected with industrial schools; St. Gall, connected 
with the industrial museum; Chaux-de-Fonds, connected with the school 
of design and engraving; Geneva, connected with the cantonal school

    THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 223 
One school for the construction of railroads in Biel, connected with 
the technical school. 
The foregoing list does not quite cover the actual condition, since 
several other institutions are maintained which are not subsidized and 
controlled by the Federal Government, as, for instance, the mfinicipal 
art school in Geneva, the watchmakers’ school at Fleurier, and the 
woman’s industrial school in Ziirich. The principle that where the 
Government does not subsidize it has no right to control is strictly 
adhered to. : 
(b) Agricultural schools: Five theoretical and practical agricultural 
schools, in Ziirich, Berne, Neuenburg; the horticultural schoolin Geneva; 
the school for wine and fruit growers and gardeners at Waedensweil; 
3 agricultural winter schools at Sursee, Brugg, and Lausanne; 4 dairy 
and cheese-making schools at Riitti, Freiburg, Sornthal, and Mcudon- - 
Lausanne. 
(c) Commercial schools: The Government subsidized, in 1892-93, 5 
commercial schools, at Geneva, Neuenburg, Chaux-de-Fonds, Berne, 
and Winterthur, and gave to 34 commercial societies small subsidies 
to cover the costs of commercial courses of instruction. 
(C) Universities—The apex of the Swiss system of education is 
formed by the universities, scientific faculties, and higher professional 
schools. Ofsuch Switzerland has 1 federal polytechnic school in Ziirich, 
founded in 1854; 6 cantonal or higher universities, Basel, 1460; Ziirich, 
1833; Berne, 1834; Geneva, 1873; Freiburg, 1889, and Lausanne, 1891; 
1 academy in Neuenburg; 2 law schools in Freiburg and Sitten; 2 
Catholic theological schools in Luzern and Solothurn, and 5 Catholic 
priests’ seminaries; 2 veterinary schools at Ziirich and Berne; 1 school 
for dentistry in Geneva. 
More minute information concerning the status of secondary, profes- 
sional, and higher institutions are found in Grob’s Jahrbuch des Unter- 
richtswesens of 1891. 3 
B.—EXPENDITURE FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES. 
The income of public education in Switzerland is derived from irre- 
ducible funds, state school taxes, and funds from the federal exchequer 
distributed pro rata of the population. 
I. Some cantons, notably Obwalden, Nidwalden, Zug, Appenzell i. 
Rh., and Thurgau, have cantonal or general school funds; but in the 
majority of the cantous the constitution, or the school law, decrees the 
formation of communal school funds. The-advanced elementary 
schools are maintained in the same way, by either communal or 
state funds. ‘The statistics published by Secretary C. Grob concern- 
ing public education in Switzerland show for the year 1881 the follow- 
ing totals of school property: Real estate, $2,614,327 francs; furniture, 
4,017,226 francs; funds, 50,903,044 frances, or a total of 137,534,597
-P-A-G-E-252

francs for primary schools only; 9,077,720 francs for advanced element- 
ary schools, which is a total of 146,612,317 franes (or $29,322,463). 
The following itemized list of cantonal school funds and property, 
which list we owe to Secretary Grob, exhibits the same variety notice-

II. In comparison with the expenditures for public school purposes 
(in 1890 they amounted to about 20,000,000 francs for primary and 
31,000,000 franes for all the public educational institutions) the amount 
of annual interest from funds is not very considerable and by no means 
the chief source of income. By far the greatest part of the expendi- 
tures has to be met by taxation. The manner in which this school 
.tax is levied and raised varies considerably in the different cantons. 
Besides, the children attending schools pay a small tuition fee. This 
custom, however, is gradually disappearing. 
Instruction in the primary grades of the public schools is gratuitous 
according to the requirements of. the federal constitution. Some ean- 
tons have extended the principle of gratuity to the advanced elementary 
schools (grammar schools); Ziirich to secondary schools, Solothurn to 
the county central schools, Baselstadt to every kind of secondary and 
preparatory schools. 
‘In late years some states have begun to publish text-books and prepare 
other supplies, and to sell them at cost of production (Ziirich, Luzern, 
Appenzell a. Rh.). Other cantons have adopted the custom of furnishing 
pupils with free text.books and supplies in the primary schools (Glarus, 
Solothurn, Baselland, Vaud, Neuenburg, and Geneva). In one canton 
this principle is carried out in all the grades of the elementary schools,  
-P-A-G-E-253
  THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 225 
primary and advanced (Baselstadt). The cantons St. Gall and Zug 
furnish only the printed text-books. In other cantons individual com- 
munities have adopted the principle of free text-books, though the 
canton in which they are situated may not have adopted it. 
III. We have seen that the sources of the income for public educa- 
tion in Switzerland vary considerably. <A like variation is noticeable 
in the distribution of the expenditures in the several cantons. The 
Year Book of 1891 offers a summary which we here append. It shows 
that for elementary and grammar school purposes the canton Basel- 
stadt pays all expenses, the canton Geneva pays more than three- 
fourths, and the following cantons pay between one-half and one-fourth: 
Ziirich, Berne, Luzern, Uri, Freiburg, Solothurn, Schaffhausen, 
Appenzell i Rh., Graubiinden, Aargau, Tessin, Vaud, and Neuenburg. 
Less than one-fourth is paid by the cantonal governments of Schwyz, 
Obwalden, Nidwalden, Glarus, Zug, Baselland, Appenzell a. Rh., St. 
Gall, Thurgau, and Wallis.

  IV. Adding to these totals the sums spent for technical and higher 
education by the Federal Government, to wit, 341,542 franes for indus- 
trial schools in 1890; 145,500 francs for agricultural schools in 1890; 
38,886 frances for commercial schools in 1891; 627,376 francs for the 
federal polytechnic school in 1890 (total from Federal Government

  C.—SCHOOL SUPERVISION, 
Each canton has a number of supervisory officers, elected for a 
definite number of years and bearing various titles. Yet, great as the 
differences in titles, length of service, and sphere of authority may be, 
there is a uniform scheme followed, i. e., a cantonal supreme school 
authority, local supervisory, and intermediate supervisory authorities. 
In Appenzell i. Rh. and Zug the functions of both cantonal and middle 
authorities are in the same hands. 
~ Local supervision of primary and grammar schools is exercised 
throughout Switzerland by commissions, or boards, whose number of 
members is not uniform. The boards are not identical with the political 
city; or town councils, but are more or less independent of the political 
authorities, being either elected directly by popular vote, or in a few 
eases appointed by the city council, and managing the schools inde- 
pendent of direct interference. Usually the school boards are essen- 
tially codrdinate with, not subordinate to, the city councils. 
The intermediate school authorities are elected in Ziirich by popular 
vote, but in other cantons they are appointed by the supreme cantonal 
authority. They are considered executive officers as well as inspectors. 
In two cantons, Aargau and Solothurn, these functions are separated 
and given into the hands of different men. In nearly all the cantons 
professional and authoritative supervision is exercised by these inter- 
mediate school officers and the cantonal or state inspector. In morecom- 
plicated school systems a superintendent or inspector for each kind of 
schools is appointed, namely, for the primary, advanced elementary, 
secondary, ete. 
The cantonal or state authorities are constituted with even less uni- 
formity than the lower ones. In Graubiinden and in the smaller demo- 
cratic original cantons (such as Uri, Obwalden, and Zug) the highest 
educational authority is separated from the executive branch of the 
government, and perfectly independent, except that it is legally obliged 
to report annually. In the other cantons the school authorities are 
connected with the political authorities in as much as the presiding officer 
must be a member of the government. Two methods are noticeable in 
this: Hither the weight of decision is placed in the hands of the gov-   
-P-A-G-E-255
  THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 227 
ernment representatives and the professional members only act as 
superintendents and inspectors (as is done in Berne, Glarus, Baselland, 
Thurgau, and Vaud), or the educational department has the duty of 
management and the government officers merely reserve a nominal 
control (as is done in Ztirich, Luzern, Schwyz, Nidwalden, Freiburg, 
Solothurn, Baselstadt, Schaffhausen, both the Appenzells, St. Gall, 
Aargau, Tessin, Wallis, Neuenburg, Geneva). 
In some cantons the teachers’ association, or its representatives (as _ 
in Ziirick, Berne, Neuenburg, and Geneva), or the school inspectors 
(as in Schwyz and other cantons), or the faculty of the normal school 
(as in Solothurn) has a legal influence upon the central management of 
the schools. In the cantons of Berne, Freiburg, and Vaud the politi- 
eal authorities enter upon the management of the lower schools by 
supervising the discipline and attendance. 
D.—SCHOOL ITYGIENE AND SPECIAL PROVISION, 
For the purpose of regulating the hygienic conditions of the schools, 
with reference to architecture, furniture, and sanitary control, a num- 
ber of cantons have made thorough legal provision. The Swiss Zeit- 
schrift fiir Statistik for 1884 gives a complete list of all the regulations 
and Jaws in force. Generally speaking, honest efforts are made to 
come up to legal requirements and to the results of recent investiga- 
tions as far as possible under existing circumstances. In some cities 
the school authorities are more vigorous in this respect than in the 
country, and in consequence the latest progress in hygiene is consid- 
ered; thus bath-rooms are put into the schools of Basel. The cities of 
Berne and Winterthur have introduced instruction in swimming as 
part of the gymnastic exercises; open air games are organized in 
Ziirich, Winterthur, Waedensweil, Berne, Freiburg, Basel, Schaffhan- 
sen, St. Gall, Aarau, Weinfelden, in the college of Mariahilf in Schwyz,. 
and other places. Skating, too, is frequently encouraged by the school 
authorities, who arrange for skating vacations, and by preparing ice- 
fields for this sport; excursions on foot and on the railroads are 
arranged duringthesummer. Theintroduction of hygienic school furni- 
ture is an object of great solicitude everywhere in Switzerland. The 
so-called perpendicular writing in preference to slanting writing is at 
present the subject of most animated controversies. Several cities have 
arranged for regular examinations of the pupils’ eyes at stated inter- 
vals, others have made the ears and the organs of speech subjects of 
special investigation. 
In several cantons, especially in large cities, the school authorities fur- 
nish warm dinners and clothes to indigent pupils, and afford opportunity 
for changing and drying wet clothing of children who come from a dis- 
tance. During summer vacation colonies and ‘milk cures” are arranged 
for poor and sickly children; also asylums where children may be kept 
after school hours and employed with manual work. Ziirich, Basel, 
St. Gall, Geneva and a few other cities have special classes for weak- 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
228 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
minded children (écoles gardiennes). In some cities and villages savings 
banks are connected with the schools. A number of blind asylums, 
deaf-mute schools, and institutions for imbeciles attend to the physically 
abnormal; other institutions of refuge and reformatories attend to the 
morally neglected and depraved youth. Music schools are found in 
Ziirich, Winterthur, Berne, Luzerne, Schaffhausen, Aarau, and Lau- 
sanne. Well-managed school gardens are maintained in the cities of 
Berne, in Langnau, and Feldbach (Ziirich), in Pratteln (Baselland), in 
Lichtensteig and Buchs (St. Gall) and in Lustorf (Thurgau). 
E.—TEACHERS. 
  Teachers are licensed by the cantonal governments. Licenses are 
granted only if the required proof of moral character is furnished and 
a certain age has been reached. A cantonal examination of the candi- 
date’s scholarship is generally required, except in a few cantons where 
the certificate of graduation from a normal school is accepted in lieu of 
an examination. 
The teachers of advanced elementary schools are required to pass 
an additional examination. In recent years the license to teach female 
handiwork is made dependent upon attendance on a special course 
of preparation and an examination. 
Throughout the greater part of Switzerland women find employment 
in the primary school, but their remuneration is, as a rule, smaller than 
that of men. In advanced (or grainmar) schools women are employed 
as class teachers only in the cantons of Berne, Luzern, Schwyz, Uri, 
Obwalden, Nidwalden, Freiburg, Baselstadt, Baselland, St. Gall, 
Tessin, Wallis, Neuenburg, and Geneva. 
It is interesting to note the percentages of women teachers in the 
different cantons:

This table was prepared by Mr. C. Grob in 1881. A comparison with 
statistics of 1891 from other sources reveals the fact that the average 
has since risen to 33-3 per cent, though the cantons of Schaffhausen 
and Appenzell a. Rh. have entirely abandoned the practice of employ- 
ing women as teachers in elementary schools.
-P-A-G-E-257
  THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM. 229 
The regular training of teachers is given in secondary schools in the 
cantons of Neuenburg, Geneva, and Basel, while in all other cantons 
special normal schools are established for that purpose, but in Grau- 
biinden and Solothurn these normal schools are departments of the 
cantonal central school. Only one normal school is open to both sexes. 
Switzerland has 37 normal schools altogether. Of these 23 are open 
exclusively to men, 13 only to women, and 1 to both sexes. Of the 37 
Swiss normal schools, 22 are German, 13 French, and 2 Italian. The 
cantons or states maintain 25 of these schools; 4 are maintained by 
communities; 8 are private institutions. For further statistics see p. 
172. 
In some cantons the definite appointment of a teacher is preceded 
by a period of probation of two years. The appointment of teachers is 
decided by general election or by a school board, or, as in Geneva, by 
the city council. Usually the teacher is elected for life. In some can- 
tons the right to call for a teachers’ resignation is reserved. In a few 
cantons the teachers are elected or appointed for a definite number of 
years (three to eight). Reélection is permissible. 
In Catholic cantons certain ecclesiastical positions are connected 
with educational work in advanced elementary schools. 
As a rule, the teacher is by law and contract obliged to give instruc- 
tion a certain number of hours per week, to attend certain courses of 
instruction for his own benefit, to become a member of an aid society 
in order to secure a pension for himself, widow, and orphans. He is 
also obliged to arrange continuation and evening schools for boys and 
girls past school age, and not infrequently the care of the school building 
devolves upon him. Occupations that would interfere with his voca- 
tion are prohibited. He is free from certain duties that other citizens 
have to perform, as for instance, watch duty, statute service. In Wallis 
the teacher is exempted from income taxes. These privileges give him 
a high position in the community. 
Salaries.—The teachers’ salaries are higher in advanced elementary 
(or grammar) than in primary schools. They vary considerably in the 
different cantons. Somecantons have no legally fixed minimum salary. 
The following table was compiled in 1881; later information is wanting: 
The minimum salary of primary teachers is below 1,000 franes ($200) 
in the cantons, Wallis, 187 francs; Nidwalden, 448; Uri, 451; Tessin, 
572; Obwalden, 597; Graubiinden, 669; Schwyz, 758; Zug, 778; Appen- 
zelli. Rh. 882; Freiburg, 898. 
The minimum varies between 1,000 and 1,500 francs in the cantons, 
Aargau, 1,207 francs; Berne, 1,249; Luzern, 1,289; Solothurn, 1,283; 
Neuenburg, 1,356; Baselland, 1,446. 
The minimum varies between 1,500 and 2,000 francs in the cantons: 
Vaud, 1,514 franes; Thurgau, 1,552; St. Gall, 1,554; Glarus, 1,610; 
Schaffhausen, 1,623; Geneva, 1,647; Appenzell a. Rh., 1,821. 
In Ziirich and Baselstadt it exceeds 2,000 francs, to wit: Ziirich, 
2,192; Baselstadt, 2,778. 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
    230 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
It is plain, though, that these figures are only of relative value, since 
they do not represent the actual salaries paid, but only the lowest. 
Switzerland bas 23 pension funds and aid societies for teachers, 
widows, and orphans. Most cantons provide for pensions; others only 
aid the voluntary pension funds of the teachers, but all recognize the 
duty of the state to pension teachers after a certain number of years, 
which varies between 30 and 45 years. 
F.—STATISTICS. ! 
A.—PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
The number of school districts in 1891 was 3,847 with 8,239 schools. 
The number of pupils in 1891 was 467,596 (234,618 boys and 232,978 
girls). The number of teachers was 9,332 (6,224 men and 3,108 women). 
In 1891 the number of pupils to one teacher was 50. The average 
attendance in 189091 was 84:97 per cent (an improvement of 4:05 per 
cent over 1881). These and the following numbers do not include pri- 
vate schools. 
B.—ADVANCED ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The number of pupils in 1891 in 477 schools was 28,537 (16,346 boys 
and 12,191 girls). Teachers, 1,370 (1,178 men and 192 women). 
C.—CONTINUATION SCHOOLS, 
The number of pupils in 1891 was 40,575 (37,292 boys, 3,283 girls). 
In these schools recruits prepare for entering the army by reviewing 
their elementary studies. 
D.—SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
The number of secondary and technical (such as normal) schools is 
not stated, but the number of students in 1891 was 19,299, nearly all 
boys. 
E.—HIGHER EDUCATION. 
In the universities and the federal polytechnicum the number of stu- 
dents in 1891 was 3,073, (2,847 young men and 226 young ladies). 
Dr. Huber, an educational authority in Switzerland, having access to 
reports of private schools, makes this statement, which certainly comes 
nearer the true figures than the total of the foregoing. 
The total number of pupils in elementary schools in 1891 was 
549,067, to wit:

CHAPTER VIII. 
THE RESULTS OF HOME TRAINING AND INFLUENCE. 
  (From the German of Franz Schéberle, Vienna.) 
[The following presentation may seem very fragmentary and the 
figures too inadequate for use as a hasis for generalizations such as the 
author indulges in. The inquiries may have, in some cases, resulted 
in erroneous statements. The facts themselves may be considered dubi- 
ous; at least the place in which they are gathered (the city of Vienna) 
may not be the proper standard of comparison for other localities. The 
grouping of facts may be defective, inasmuch as it is done by what the 
author himself considers social standards—not by any standard gener- 
ally agreed upon. In many eases potent educational influences may 
have escaped the author’s observation; hence his conclusions may be 
faulty. Yet, after making all due allowances, after admitting all this 
and more, there remains a residue of suggestive thought in the little 
table, the author or compiler of which was a man who, for several years, 
patiently plodded in the service of science without hope of reward, 
except such as warm-hearted appreciation can offer. 
The author presents only the first table, which shows each item as 
compared with the sum total of all cases observed. Two more tables 
are inserted, showing the same items, first, compared with the sum of 
each column; secondly, compared with the sum of each line. _ In other 
words, inquiry has been made into the relation one number bears to 
the total number of the social class of which it forms a part, and then 
into the relation the same number bears to the total number of children 
under similar educational influences.— The Translator.|

This table (table 1, the author’s) is the result of five years’ study 
and observation in three ward schools of the city of Vienna, Austria. 
The observations were made by a teacher in fifteen class rooms and 
embrace 9,000 children of various ages between 10 and 14 years. Both 
sexes were observed, but from the explanatory remarks of the author 
we see that it was chiefly boys whom he studied. A comparatively 
large portion of the children belong to the lower strata of society. 
Though the tables might speak for themselves the explanations of the 
author may be helpful. 
Line a (horizontal) contains the number of children, grouped in three 
classes, whose parents try to educate them, consciously and with a 
purpose in view, according to ethical principles or maxims, as, for 
instance, simplicity in appearance, word, and action, respect for others, 
sense of order and law, honesty, truthfulness, and uprightness. These 
children possess ideals of right, are ambitious, but not at the expense 
of others, and they are generally trained well in obedience and imbued 
with the sense of firmness and justice. 
Line b contains the number of children whose parents are chiefly 
passive in their duties toward education. All they do is confined to 
a prevention of degeneracy on the one hand and a development of 
those impulses and actions which are presupposed and implied by 
society. These groups represent the “mechanical virtues.” It is the 
discipline of formalism.that we find here. 
Line ¢ contains the number of children who are educated in a one- 
sided manner; that is, some important factor of education is neglected. 
For instance, respect of one’s own person or respect for others; or sense
-P-A-G-E-261
  RESULTS OF HOME TRAINING. 233 
of honorand ambition are repressed; hypocrisy, vaunting, or mendacity 
are systematically, though not in all cases consciously, taught. 
Line d contains the number of children found to be badly educated. 
Their training violates, either with or without intention, ethical princi- 
ples. In these groups we find souls brutalized by bad examples; con- 
tempt for others because of their poverty or some natural defect; 
intentional negation of the ideas of rights such as ‘“‘mine and thine;” 
also absence of repression of sensuality. : 
Column I contains the numbers representing the offspring of wealthy 
or cultured parents, such as people living on the proceeds of invested 
funds, owners of manufactories, noblemen, high army officers, physi- 
cians, lawyers, teachers, and high civil officers. 
Column II contains the number of children coming from the middle 
class of society, people who have a secure income, either a fixed salary 
or an established business, tradespeople and mechanics who own their 
shops; also persons in positions of responsibility in factories and 
offices, such as foremen, supervisors, and subaltern officers. 
Column IIT contains the number of children of the laboring and serv- 
ing class, people who earn wages as “hands” in factories and shops, 
and those who have no fixed or steady income, such as servants, coach- 
men, men aud charwomen; also all who live directly or indirectly upon 
charity. 
Minute inquiries and investigations with regard to the parents, have 
resulted as follows: 
Ta. Father and mother are earnest, well educated, and observant at 
home. In Ila, we find almost the same qualities in the parents, only 
that the pecuniary means are so much less abundant that the influence 
and authority of the parent is somewhat lessened. IIIa. The father 
works in the factory or at home, but is represented by a well inclined, 
strong mother, whose authority he reinforces. 
Id and 11d. The father is away from home during the day, the mother 
is weak both physically and educationally. II1b. Father and mother 
have no comprehension of education. 
Icand Ile. The father has no comprehension of education, no higher 
ideas, lives chiefly in the pursuit of pleasure; the mother is fond of 
dress, vain and without ethical strength. III ¢. The father and mother 
can only be driven to work by dire necessity or compulsion. 
Id and Ild. The parents are either purse-proud or proud of descent 
and position. III d. The father is as a rule, unknown. The mother 
represents a very low grade of intellectual development. 
Observations among these various children in the schoolroom have 
shown the following characteristics and indications pointing towards 
their future career: 
Ia. The children are earnest, aspiring from habit, sometimes preco- 
cious and conceited, have sympathy with others, study diligently, but 
avoid publicity. They are apt to become silent benefactors, travelers,
-P-A-G-E-262
      
234 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
investigators, scientists, ete. II a. These children are also earnest 
and aspiring, but the latter from foresight; remain without intercourse 
with their schoolmates, have no pronouneed inclinations, and a charac- 
ter difficult to define. If they pursue higher studies they do so for 
bread, but are not prompted by the love of study. In public life they 
are mostly patient listeners; they are apt to be “yea, yea,” and “nay, 
nay” persons. IIIa. Children enumerated in this column are also 
earnest and ambitious, but from necessity. They possess litile expe- 
rience, their intellectual horizon is limited, owing to poverty; they are 
bashful, but have very vivid imaginations; they are apt to drift into 
channels of study which can be pursued without a great outlay of 
money. Future idealists, explorers, collectors, and poets are likely to 
spring from this group. : 
ib. The children of this group are superficial, have much experience, 
but need incentives for study constantly. They generally follow the pro- 
fessions of their fathers; participate in public life; but never have any 
original ideas that open new ways. Sportsmen and the officers of social 
clubs and societies are recruited from this group. 
IL bd. Incentives for learning and working in this group are spontane- 
ous; hence self-consciousness is developed to-a high degree. These 
ehildren will be found to become pronounced characters, and furnish 
the leaders in public life. 
ILL d.. These children have some sense of honor which incites them to 
action; but they are easily approached, hence easily tempted and led 
astray. If they reach manhood without coming into conflict with the 
law, life’s experiences improve them, and they become foremen, section- 
leaders and the like. 
Le. The girls are poor in intellect, love appearances and finery, are 
frivolous-and void of good manners. The boys are distinguished by 
despotic and domineering conduct toward their schoolmates; they 
are apt to become sensual, void of sympathy for misfortune and poverty. 
They squander their inheritance or easily gained fortunes, and will 
be egotists or spendthrifts. : 
Itc. In this group we meet with imitators, the so-called universal 
genius, the jack of all trades and master of none, people who are never 
satisfied with whatever profession they may choose.. The profession of 
gamblers recruits itself from this class. 
Ill ¢. These are children who simulate misery and claim sympathy, 
who have no self-confidence or self-respect. A good teacher will often 
train them to become trustworthy workmen, and he will awaken self- 
respect in them. 
Id. Here we find the children who have contempt for all who rank 
below them. They do not think it necessary to study hard, knowing 
that their parents are wealthy. Sympathy for others is rarely found 
among them; hence egotists, usurers, and many who take advantage 
of others, are recruited from this group.
-P-A-G-E-263
  RESULTS OF HOME TRAINING. : 230: 
If d. These children feel no desire to learn or to work, attend school 
very irregularly, and when they do so, it is to amuse themselves. The 
boys are apt to become dandies, forgers, and defrauders. 
III d. The children of this class are frequently withheld from school, 
or attend only by compulsion. The girls are morally bad and apt to 
sink low while the boys grow up to be candidates for the reform 
school and penitentiary. 
For the work in school, some remarkable conclusions may be drawn 
from the foregoing tables. 
The children of line a, columns IJ, I, and III, have home training. 
Those of I a have much recreation in the open air, but always under 
surveillance of parents, or other reliable persons. The summer is spent 
in the country. Physical development is cared for assiduously. Their 
health is normal, but sometimes they are a little delicate, and hence are 
kept from school in bad weather. Those of II @ are also under super- 
vision at all hours of the day, and spend much time in the open air. 
Their mode of life is natural, effeminacy is not found in this group; 
hence, the health of these children is always good and attendance at 
school regular. Those of III ¢ find their only recreation and bodily 
exercise by walking to and from school. Everything is wanting to aid 
physical training. The parents fear bad influence and example among 
the schoolmates and watch over their children too anxiously. Often 
food is insufficient, and the children of this group furnish the greatest 
number of sickly pupils; hence, the greatest percentage of mortality. _ 
The whole group Ia, Ifa, II @ seems destined to act as examples of 
good conduct for others, but owing to their exclusiveness, this benefi- 
cent influence is lost as far as school is concerned. During lessons the 
children of the first three groups (Ia, IL a, IIL a), are quiet workers, 
slow in thinking, exact and prompt in doing their tasks, but without 
pronounced vivacity. They never give cause for complaint, are satis- 
fying all reasonable demands, yet are not a source of real joy to a 
teacher, because everything such children do betokens outer compul- 
sion. Spontaneity is rarely found among them. 
The whole group, Ib, 1b, IIL}, prefers the streets and parks after 
school hours, and can not be kept at home. The children distinguish 
themselves by great practical experience. They observe and compre- 
hend quickly, are quick and skillful in motion, have a fresh complexion, 
cheerful looks, are attentive when interested, and quick in repartee. 
In their work they are frequently negligent in form, but generally cor- 
rect in the solution of problems, mathematical and otherwise. Their 
vivacity and adroitness are a constant source of pleasure to the teacher; — 
they enliven the whole school, and not unfrequently engage in mischief 
and playfulness, but rarely, if ever, in wicked acts. Innate interest 
in what is taught makes them noisy and pert, but they are easily called 
to order. Teachers remember such children with much pleasure. 
The whole group Ie, If¢, and Ile tends toward hypocrisy. These
-P-A-G-E-264
236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  children are quiet—in fact, the least noisy of all—but where they can 
play a trick unseen and with the presumption of not being found out 
they do so, and often do very wicked things. Characteristic qualities 
of these children are deceit, treachery, malignity, and conceit. During 
recitations they rely upon being prompted, boast of work obtained by 
deceit, always have a good excuse for whatever infraction of rules they 
cause, and are quick in shifting their guilt upon the shoulders of others. 
Outside of school the children grouped under Ic keep aloof from 
those of other groups and associate only with children of their own 
“set.” Those of group Ile seek intercourse with others, but their 
friendship is not lasting; they are apt to quarrel, to pry into the affairs 
of others, and to spoil play. Those of III¢ may be imposed upon, and 
can be ruled by presenting them with some little thing, as an apple, a 
toy, or a piece of bread. For a consideration like that, they accept even 
positions in a game which no other child would take. 
The children of the three groups d (Id, Id, II d), are not often 
found in school; those of Id because they do not need to learn much 
(so they and their parents think) and because “the teachers keep 
school merely for the sake of the salary attached to their positions.” 
Those of II d are often absent from school, because regular attendance 
and hard study are inconvenient, hence they are frequently “quite ill” 
at the beginning of a school session, but quite lively after the session 
progr s, and they see that the teacher takes no notice of their fancied 
indisposition. Those of IIId are rarely found in school because they 
dislike study. Those of Id walk alone on the street and look with con- 
tempt upon the others as a “beggarly pack;” the boys learn to smoke 
early and like to play the réle of grandees. Those of IId roain about 
the streets and spend for candy and toys the pennies given them for 
school requisites. They are not very scrupulous as to where they get 
their pennies. Those of [II d are the poison of juvenile society. 
The health of the children in groups II d and III d is indestructible. 
The children withstand all influences of the weather, are insufficiently 
clad in winter, and seem not to be susceptible to infectious diseases. 
As has been said before, the entire three groups @ shrink from exercising 
an influence upon public education, the children of the three groups b - 
are the tormenting spirits on the streets, whose play and noise is harm- 
less but annoying to adults. The children of the three groups c are, 
for purposes of public education, of no appreciable consequence; those 
of group d are even dangerous, noticeably those of III d. They fre- 
quent remote streets, dark alleys, field and wood paths, caves, canals, 
and appear in crowded streets only like hostile enemies to make sallies 
and inroads upon civilization. Here they meet children of groups II b 
and IIIb, and impress themselves forcibly upon them by expressions 
of brutality and immorality, and by-descriptions of the enjoyment they 
have secured for themselves by defying lawand order. Thus they-enlist 
others who, without contact with vice, might become good citizens, 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  RESULTS OF HOME TRAINING. 237 
  These 900 (III d) tempt the 885 of II } and the 3,420 of IIT 6, and draw 
astray into the slums many who, under other circumstances, might 
remain good through habit, if not from principle. The children of this 
group, III d, are dangerous companions at all times. : 
Reviewing the whole matter, we see that the parents of group a of 
all three classes withhold their children from contact with schoolmates 
chiefly on account of the 900 of group III @, and that parental imilu- 
ence in group 0 is often too weak to prevent evil influences from out- 
side. The Government must do something to allay the apprehension 
of parents of the three groups a, and to protect the children of the 
three groups b. Home training needs a reinforcement in form of super- 
vision on the streets and play grounds. Public play grounds, well con- 
ducted by skilled and experienced teachers, should be established and main- 
tained by the city authorities, and patronized and attended as regularly as 
the schools. 
[The statistical matter offered in this article may, as has been said, 
seem defective by reason of its fragmentary nature, but it may induce 
others to follow up the idea, and make similar studies and submit the 
results to the light of criticism, as this is submitted, with all due defer- 
ence to the opinion of others.—The Translator. |

CHAPTER IX. 
SCHOOL MUSEUMS, EDUCATIONAL LIBRARIES, AND 
PERMANENT EXHIBITIONS OF APPLI- 
ANCES FOR TEACHING. 
A HISTORICAL AND STATISTICAL REVIEW. 
  The following is a summary of a book, entitled The Pedagogical 
Libraries, School Museums, and Permanent Exhibition of School Appli- 
ances, with special regard to the Pedagogical Central Library (Comenius- 
Foundation) at Leipzig, by Julius Beeger, director of the Pedagogical 
Central Library at Leipzig (pp. 84, 1892). This work may be considered 
the most reliable and most comprehensive report on educational collec- 
tions. 
1.— HISTORY OF EDUCATIONAL COLLECTIONS. 
School libraries are quite an old institution; they originated at the 
time when schools were established within, or in connection with con- 
vents. But these libraries served exclusively the purposes of the school 
to which they belonged. Educational or teachers’ libraries for entire 
school or governmental districts, which came into existence during the 
first half of the Nineteenth Century, were made serviceable to wider 
circles. Some schoolmen, like Dr. Ed. Diirre in Weinheim, conceived 
quite early the necessity of large libraries for far-reaching purposes in- 
educational centers, but such plans found no realization. 
The beginnings of school museums may be traced back to the exhi- 
bitions of school appliances connected with national teachers’ asso- 
ciations, and industrial state or world’s expositions. With them they 
appeared, and with them they vanished. The result of mirute inquiries 
establishes the fact that the oldest school museum in the world is the 
Educational Museum at Toronto (Canada); it was founded in 1853. 
Then foilowed in 1857 the Educational Division of the South Kensing- 
ton Museum. In 1864 the Pedagogical Museum at Petersburg, and in 
1865 the Permanent Exhibition of Scheol Appliances at Leipzig were 
founded. Thelast-named institution came to an untimely end in couse-— 
quence of lack of interest on the part of the managers; the objects 
remaining intact were given over to the Comenius Foundation at 
Leipzig, which organization had meanwhile assumed large proportions. 
In 1867-8 the Bureau of Education in Washington began to collect 
239
-P-A-G-E-268
240 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  educational works and objects for school use, with the intention of 
establishing a museum and a library. In 1870 the Pedagogische 
Bibliotheek van het Nederlandsch Onderwijzers Genootschap (the Peda- 
gogical Library of the Dutch Teachers’ Association), and the following 
year the Pedagogical Central Library (Comenius Foundation), at Leip- 
zig, were founded. 
The Permanent Exhibition of School Appliances in Vienna was cre- 
ated by a resolution of the city council July 30, 1872, but since 1891 it 
has been abandoned, appropriations for its maintenance having been 
refused. In 1873 the Hungarian School Appliance Museum (Orszdgos 
tanszer muzeum) at Budapest was founded, but not opened until 3878. In 
Rome, after the model of the institution in Vienna, a museum for instrue- 
tion and education (Museo @ istruzione e @ educazione) was opened in 
1874, which, however, was soon abandoned. The Cassianeum, at Do- 
nauworth (founded 1875, in Neuberg on the Danube), may be considered 
the most flourishing institution of this kind at that period. In 1875 
the Swiss Permanent School Exposition in Ziirich was founded. Since 
1890 it bears the name Pestalozzianum. In 1876 the pedagogical 
library of the Nederlandsch Onderwijzers’ Genootschap was reorgan- 
ized into the Netherlandish School Museum at Amsterdam. In the 
same year the German School Museum at Berlin was opened; also a 
city school Museum, on February 10, 1877, created by resolution of 
the school board. The year 1877 also witnessed the establishment of 
the great Pedagogical Museum at Tokio, in Japan. In 1878 the estab- 
lishment of one of the most noted institutions of this kind, the State 
school museum at Brussels was suggested, and in 1880 it was opened 
under the name National School Museum. Equal in importance with 
that in Belgium is the Pedagogical Museum and Central Library for 
Elementary Instruction, established in Paris in 1879. In the same year 
a School exhibition at Berne and the school museum at K6nigsberg 
were opened, the latter established and maintained by the city teachers. 
The year 1881 saw the opening of the Provincial School Exhibition at 
Magdeburg and the Permanent Exhibition of School Appliances at Graz, 
in Austria. One year later, 1882, a pedagogical museum was opened 
in Madrid, and likewise a municipal pedagogical museum at Lisbon. 
On December 3, 1883, the National School Museum at Rio de Janeiro was 
opened, and at about the same date the Freiburg Educational Society 
induced the cantonal government to establish a permanent school exhi- 
bitionin Freiburg. The Pedagogical Library at Stockholm, founded by 
teachers, dates from the same year. In the year 1886 the Permanent 
School Exhibition at Neuenburg, in Switzerland, in 1887 the Museum 
for ElementarySchools at Rostock, and in 1888 the Thuringian School 
Museum at Jena came into existence. The year 1889 saw the birth of 
three such institutions, the School Museum at Hildesheim, the Per- 
manent School Exhibition of the German Teachers’ Union at Innsbruck, 
and the School Museum atCassel. In 1890 a school museum was opened 
at Kiel, and lastly, in 1891, a school museum in Braunschweig.

  SCHOOL MUSEUMS, LIBRARIES, AND APPLIANCES. 241 
Several institutions of this kind are planned and will probably be 
opened in the near future in Genoa, Basel, and Bozen. . In Hannover 
a similar plan crystallized into establishing a special department of 
pedagogy in the city library, which contains a reading room for 
teachers. In Australia, also, the idea seems to take root. The Colony 
Victoria will open a school museum at Melbourne, the Legislature hay- 
ing passed a resolution to that effect in 1891. 
II. EDUCATIONAL COLLECTIONS OF THE PRESENT TIME, 
A. GERMANY. 
1. German school museum at Berlin.—This institution is a private 
enterprise on the part of the teachers’ association in Berlin. It con- 
tains an exhibition of school appliances and an educational library of 
over 14,000 volumes. <A specialty of the German school museum is 
the collection of literary and other works of some distinguished edu- 
cators in separate alcoves. Thus, the Diesterweg, Pestalozzi, and Har- 
cort collections are very complete. In 1891 the income was about $300. 
The institution is situated in Blumen Str., No. 63 a. Custodian, A. 
Rebhuhn. 
2. City school museum at Berlin.—Belongs to the city, which main- 
tains it. Annual appropriation in 1888, about $1,000. The institution 
has a building of its own in Stallschreiber Str., No. 54. Custodian, 
Rector A. Baeblich. 
3. Cassianeum at Donauwirth (Bavaria).—This institution is private. 
It was established by a teacher, Ludwig Auer, whois still its custodian. 
The library has the purpose of collecting material for scientific work ’ 
in pedagogy, and offers it for use to men engaged in such work. In 
1891 the library had 40,000 volumes and pamphlets and 150 appli- 
ances for teaching. In connection with the museum Mr. Auer main- 
tains a boy’s academy and a “pedagogium,” in which educational 
literary production is carried on. Hight periodicals, several calendars 
and juvenile journals are published in the institution. It is situated 
in the former Benedictine monastery of the Holy Cross. The library 
has an annual income of $500 from the publications of the pedagogium. 
A special librarian is engaged. 
4. Thuringian School Museum at Jena.—This institution was founded, 
December 8, 1888, by Teacher Ernst Piltz, who had been the prime 
mover of the formation of the Thuringian school museum society. This 
society manages the institution, which was opened March 31,1889. Its 
purpose is to furnish principals and teachers in schools of all kinds 
with appliances and other means of instruction, facilitate the study of 
candidates for highest positions, and instruct parents and friends of 
popular education in becoming acquainted with the science and prac- 
tice of teaching, and lastly, to enable manufacturers of appliances, as 
well as publishers, to exhibit their objects and books without cost. 
The income of the institution is limited to the dues of the society (25 
ED 92——16
-P-A-G-E-270
    
  242 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
cents per annum for each member). This museum is located in a hotel 
(Weimarischer Hof) in Jena and occupies the entire upper story and 
several other rooms. Custodian, Ernst Piltz. 
5. School Museum at Hildesheim.—This institution was founded in 
1891 by the teachers of the city, aided by the city council. Itis located 
in the new school building on Liitzel Str. Custodian, A. Kreipe. 
6. Schleswig-Holstein School Museum at Kiel.—This was founded, upon 
motion of Teacher Wolgast, by the teachers’ society. of Kiel. Five 
members are entrusted with the management. Custodian, Mr. Door- 
mann, Stern Str. 
7. School Museum of Kénigsberg.—This consists of a city library for 
elementary teachers and a collection of appliances. The library con- 
tains 5,000 volumes, the museum a number of appliances for teaching 
and drawing models. A special feature of this institution is the collec- 
tion of literature concerning Dinter, a noted Prussian educator. The 
income of the institution is derived from dues of society members and 
annual appropriations from the city council. It is located in the annex 
of the gymnasium. Bahnhofs Str., No. 2. Custodian, E. Danziger. 
8. Pedagogical Central Library at Leipzig (formerly Comenius Stif- 
tung).—The prime moyer in founding this institution was its present 
director, Julius Beeger, who suggested it in an oration delivered on 
the two hundredth anniversary of Comenius’ death, November 15, 1871. 
The purpose of this institution is to make available to all educators 
and educational authors in Germany and Austria the entire literary 
material that has reference to education in kindergarten, elementary, 
secondary, higher, and special schools, German as well as foreign. 
This library is intended to promote pedagogical science—hence to 
serve all persons who are engaged in that pursuit. At present the 
library contains 60,000 volumes and pamphlets. The funds of the 
institution are scanty—hence it is impossible to keep the library abreast 
of the times. It is located in the teachers’ house, Kramer-Strasse 
No. 4, and occupies a large hall and a reading and waiting room. 
Teachers and authors, as well as students of pedagogy and normal 
schools, are entitled to the free use of thelibrary. Teachersin Leipzig 
may keep books for four weeks, nonresidents for eight weeks. Custo- 
dian, Julius Beeger. 
9. Permanent School Hxhibit of the Teachers’ Association of the Province 
of Saxony at Magdeburg.—Was founded in 1881, Itis intended strictly 
to be confined to an exhibition of appliances, models, and illustrations. 
Books are excluded. It is located in a schoolroom, Schul-Strasse No. 
1. The management is in the hands of a committee. Present custo- 
dian, Teacher Weber. 
10. Permanent Exhibition of School Furniture and School Appliances 
at Munich.—This institution belongs to the government of Upper Bava- 
ria, and is intended to be a collection of the best appliances for teach- 
ing, school furniture, and supplies for elementary and continuation
-P-A-G-E-271
SCHOOL MUSEUMS, LIBRARIES, AND APPLIANCES, 
schools. It is also to aid teachers in procuring supplies at low prices. 
The institution is located on Heumarket No. 2; it has a board of man- 
agers. 
11. People’s School Museum at Rostock (Mecklenburg).—It was founded 
in 1887, and is the property of the museum society. Its catalogue has 
2,200 numbers. Librarian, l'eacher O. Obenhaus. 
B. SWITZERLAND. 
  2. School Dxhibition in Berne.—A private enterprise subsidized by 
the state and the city. The institution is located in the cavalry bar- 
racks. The members of a society for the maintenance of this institu- 
tion tax themselves in order to secure the state subsidy. Teacher 
Liithiis custodian. 
13. Exposition scolaire permanente in Fribourg.—A_ private. enter- 
prise enjoying state subsidy. It was founded in 1883. This institu- 
tion being situated near the border line of German Switzerland has 
assumed great importance, since it objectively displays German and 
French methods of teaching, besides promoting school education in 
general. The expenses are nearly covered by the income from admis-

CHARACTER AND HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN 
UNIVERSITIES.

INTRODUCTION. 
GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 
The many varied forms of universities of the present day may be 
traced back to or grouped around three types: the English, French, 
and German types.     
| Translated by Dr. L. R. Klemm, specialist in German education, a

248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  The English type, represented by the two old and venerable univer- 
sities Oxford and Cambridge, is the oldest. We find represented in it 
- the original form of the Middle Age university, because England is the 
most conservative country in Europe, a country in which ancient cus- 
toms are most faithfully preserved. The university in England is a free 
corporation resting upon a church basis; it has its own government and 
maintains itself from funds and estates derived from bequests; the state 
government has nothing to do with the routine of the management. 
The regulations of life and conduct are in fundamental principles simi- 
lar to those of the university of the Middle Ages: teachers and scholars 
live together in colleges and halls in a kind of monastic community. 
The instruction also resembles both in matter and form the instruction 
of an ancient university, and its chief faculty is the facultas artiwm. 
Its aim is essentially an extensive and profound general education suit- 
able for a gentleman ; scientific investigation as well as scientific prep- 
aration for the learned professions lie outside the pale of English uni- 
versity instruction. The chief branches of study arethose that promote 
general education, such as languages, history, mathematics, natural 
sciences, and philosophy. The mode of teaching is that of a school; in 
many cases it is purely private-instruction. 
The French type of a university has departed farthest from the ancient 
form. The great revolution swept away with one stroke the ancient 
universities like many other institutions, intending to makeroom for anew 
structure to be erected according to geometrical lines. Not until the 
imperial throne was set up did the new university plan assume shape 
and form. The place of the ancient universities was taken by independ- 
ent faculties for the several learned professions that necessitate scien- 
tifie preparation : facultés de droit, de médecine, des sciences, des lettres. 
The ancient combination of the faculties to the unity of a university was 
abandoned, even the term university would have vanished had it not 
been preserved in a changed significance in the Université de France. 
Here it means the great centralized body of administration of public 
instruction that embraces every public educational institution of the 
land, from the elementary to the scientific professional school. The 
facultés are now state institutions for certain professions; the instruct- 
ors are state officers and as such they conduct state examinations. 
Scientific investigation and general scientific education are not, properly 
speaking, their object in view; the former is a matter of the Academy 
of Science, the latter that of preparatory schools. 
The German type, as it is found in Germany and in neighboring coun- 
tries, the institutions of which have had a similar development (Austria, 
Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and partly, also, Russia) 
represents, as far as the outer form is concerned, a type between the 
English and the French. ‘This type has preserved more of the original 
than the French; on the other hand it has yielded more to the demands 
of modern times than the English. The German university is, like the
-P-A-G-E-277
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 249 
  French faculté, a state institution; it is established and maintained by 
the state and subject to state administration and supervision. Yet, it 
has preserved some important features of the ancient constitution of a 
corporation: It possesses a certain measure of self-government; it 
elects its own officers, rector, senate, and deans; it exercises an impor- 
tant influence upon the selection of the professors, first, by defining the 
circle from which the professors may be chosen through granting the 
degree of doctor, and deciding the question of admission of private 
lecturers (Privat-Docenten); secondly, by submitting to the government 
the names of candidates for vacant chairs. In its character as an edu- 
cational institution the German university has preserved the original 
form in its purest type; the four faculties have remained actual institu- 
tions of learning, while in England instruction and student life have 
withdrawn to a great extent into the colleges; on the other hand, the 
combination of the faculties to a living unity in the university, the 
centralized institution for all the learned professions, in contradistine- 
tion to the French plan, has also been preserved. 
Viewing the inner character of the German university its special 
feature becomes apparent at once, namely, that it is both a laboratory 
of scientific investigation and an institution for the highest scientific 
instruction, general as well as professional. Like the English univer- 
sities it offers an extensive and profound general scientific education; 
this is the special aim of the philosophic faculty. Like the French 
facultés the German university offers professional instruction for the 
learned professions, for the clergymen, the judges, the higher adminis- 
trative officers, the physicians, and teachers of secondary schoois. 
Besides this, the German universities are something which the English 
and French universities are not, namely, the principal seats of scientific 
labor—and likewise the nurseries of scientific investigation. Accord- 
ing to the German acceptation of the term a university professor is both 
a teacher and a scientific investigator, and the latter is considered the 
more important, so that the true statement should read: In Germany 
the scientific investigators are at the same time the teachers of the 
academic youth. From this it follows that academic instruction is 
thoroughly scientific; above the technical preparation for a profession 
stands the introduction into scientific truth and investigation. 
This unity of investigation and instruction characterizes the German 
university. There certainly are excellent scholars in Oxford and Cam- 
bridge, but no one will say that the English universities are the repre- 
sentatives of scientific labor in England. Many of the most noted 
scholars of England, men like Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Grote, the 
two Mills, Macaulay, Gibbon, Bentham, Ricardo, stand or stood outside 
of the university, and of many of them it may be said that they are 
impossible in an English university. Even the great learned men of 
such a university are not really the teachers of the academic youth; 
they may deliver a few dozen lectures a year, but the real instruction
-P-A-G-E-278
  
  250 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
lies in the hands ef the fellows and tutors. A similar state of affairs is 
found in France—the scientific investigator, the great learned man, 
belongs to the Académie, to the Institut de France; he is, perhaps, also 
a member of the College de France, or the Sorbonne, and, as such, he may 
read afew public lectures, to which everybody is admitted, but he is not, 
like the German professors, the actual daily teacher of the academic 
youth. Of course it can not well be expected of all the teachers of the 
facultés, notably in the provinces, that they shall be independent seien- 
tific investigators. 
In contradistinction to this, the presumption is raised in Germany 
that all university teachers are scientific investigators, really learned 
men, or that all really learned men are university professors. Natu- 
rally, there are some exceptions. Germany has had, and has now, very 
distinguished scholars who are not university professors; it suffices 
to mention Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt; likewise among 
the professors of secondary schools there are many who have gained 
fame and distinction as learned men. Similarly there are among the 
university professors some who do not accomplish much as scholars, 
who lay all their stress upon being successful teachers; but that is not 
the rule. The rule is the congruency of the two terms, learned man 
and professor. When in Germany a great scholar is mentioned the 
question is asked at once: In what university is he active? And if he 
is not in a university, it may be confidently expected that he feels this 
official disregard. Again, when a professor is mentioned the question 
is asked: What has he written? what -are his scientific achievements? 
The consequences of this relation have been most significant for the 
formation of the entire German intellectual and scientific life. 
The German scholar is also an academic teacher; upon that rests his 
position in the life of our people. Our thinkers and investigators have 
been known to the people not only as authors, but as personal teachers 
with whom they have sat face to face. Men like Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, 
Schleiermacher, have influenced their time as academic teachers; a 
Jarge part of their works was not published until after their death, 
either from-their own notes or from memoranda made by the students. 
Just so Kant and Chr, Wolff were university professors. The same is 
true of the great philologists, of Heyne, F. A. Wolf, and G. Hermann; 
they have accomplished much by their personal activity as teachers; 
their students, afterward as teachers in secondary schools, carzied the 
spirit and method of these men into the youth of the nation. Or think 
ot the activity that historians like Ranke and Waitz displayed in 
their seminaries; and it deserves special mention that among the most 
distinguished poets of the German nation more than one was a uni- 
versity professor; thus, Uhland, Riickert, Biirger, and Schiller. The 
one fact, that Luther and Melanchthon were university professors, 
speaks volumes. 
This is undoubtedly.a most fortunate cireumstance. The young 
    
-P-A-G-E-279
    GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. aoe 
generation in Germany being brought into immediate contact in the 
university with the intellectual leaders of the nation, receives the 
strongest and most abiding impulses. In German biographies the 
period spent in the university plays an important réle; not unfre 
quently the instruction received by one academic teacher determines 
the direction of the student’s subsequent efforts. On the other hand, 
the relation stated is a delightful and fruitful one for our men of erudi- 
tion and investigation; they remain young in their intercourse with 
youth. Persona. transmission of ideas has a stirring and revivifying 
influence through the quiet, yet appreciable counter-effect among the 
students, an influence which the lonely author misses. The presence 
of an audience directs the attention of the instructor constantly upon 
essential and general ideas. Inclination towards philosophy, a diree- 
tion toward leading ideas and generalization, which are said to be char- 
acteristics of the German intellect, may be explained by the fact that 
knowledge is here, more than elsewhere, acquired and generated for 
the purpose of ingenuous communication in oral instruction. 
Of course this has its disadvantages. Certain disagreeable features 
of our scientific life are direetly traceable to the “university cut” which 
science in Germany receives; thus we notice a literary overproduction; 
an inclination toward forming schools and science sects; a disregard 
for all efforts not emanating from the university, a slight which is felt 
keenly and resented violently, as is shown by Schopenhauer’s disquisi- 
tion upon the learned guild. It is true that a learned man not con- 
nected with a university can not secure appreciation in Germany as 
readily as he can in France or England; and it is also true that it 
would prove a useful corrective of our university education if inde- 
pendent scientific labor could flourish better, for it might in some ques- 
tions furnish Jess prejudiced minds and more reliable standards of 
judgment. 
Nevertheless the German nation has no cause to be dissatisfied with 
existing conditions that have historically developed. If in Germany 
science stands closer to the heart of the people than in other countries 
it is owing to the fortunate circumstance that its great men of science 
have also been the teachers of the academic youth. At any rate the 
universities must wish the continuance of this relation. The secret of 
their power consists in attracting the leading minds and being able to 
hold them; as long as that power is preserved the universities will 
succeed in holding the position they have gained in the life of the 
nation. 
Certain modifications may subsequently take place. The position 
the universities held during the first half of our century was based 
upon the fact that the national life had no other center than science 
and literature. The fact that participation in political life was denied, 
activity in industrial life greatly hampered, and competition in the 
world’s market checked by almost insurmountable obstacles, prompted
-P-A-G-E-280
  252 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
all higher activity to direct its attention to the inner life, and seek in 
the intellectual world compensation for the neglect it experienced in 
the outer world. Thus it happened that in the European community 
of nations the German people played the réle of ‘a people of thinkers 
and dreamers ;” there was no other réle left it in the cast. Germany and 
France seemed to have exchanged parts, for during the Middle Ages 
it was said that Italy had the Papacy (Papstthum), Germany the Empire 
(Kaiserthum), and France Science (Studium). 
Much of this has changed within the present generation. The Ger- 
man people, which had long been an cbject in European politics, has 
again become a subject. The unity of Germany now rests upon other 
foundations than its universities. This change has made itself felt in 
more than one direction. The universities can not in the new Empire 
remain what they were, in a certain sense, during the time of the Fed- 
eral Congress, namely, the real center of national life (the attention 
this exalted body bestowed upon them gave testimony to the fact). At 
present other ways are opened for talent to reach prominent positions; 
in the national parliament, in the army, in administrative offices, in 
the industrial world, in the colonies—everywhere a talent that puts 
itself forward will find room for application, and a prospect of influ- 
ence and gain; the prerogatives of birth have also vanished. 
Yet under these changed social conditions the universities have 
maintained themselves in their prominent position among our national 
institutions. They still are important pillars of German unity. The 
customary exchange of teachers and students between the various 
universities aud the most diverse tribes aud provinces, taking place 
almost daily, contributes not a little toward keeping alive the con- 
sciousness of national unity among the component parts of the Empire 
that are clearly defined by state boundaries. It is to be expected that 
the German universities will preserve the well-earned fame of being 
the main support of German science. This fame will remain theirs as 
long as they preserve, like a precious inheritance of the past, a spirit 
of objectivity, a quiet joy in the subject of study, faithfulness to work, 
and love of truth that deprecates evil intentions and personal con- 
siderations. 
* At present the German universities may enjoy the appreciation 
offered them in foreign countries where attempts are made to imitate 
their institutions and forms. France has just begun to again collect 
its separated ‘“facultés” to real universities, and in England it is 
attempted to raise the dissipated work of the colleges to real university 
instruction. In these attempts at carrying into effect the German idea 
of unity of scientific investigation and instruction, some of the most 
prominent American universities have been very successful.

GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 
I.—SKETCH OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT. 
  A. IN THE MIDDLE AGES. 
Origin.—The universities had their origin in France and Italy. This 
origin is cotemporaneous with the beginning of the second half of 
the Middle Ages. During the first half the eyes of the world were 
turned toward the past, toward Christianity and antiquity; at the close 
of the eleventh century people began to look forward into the future. 
Powerful impulses stirred the intellectual life; the crusades brought 
the occidental nations into close contact with one another and with the 
oriental world; the religion and culture of Islam entered the field of 
vision. In chivalry arose a promoter of secular literature and educa- 
tion, and the new orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans formed a 
kind of religio-clerical chivalry. The great names that represented the 
new and flourishing theology and philosophy of that age belonged to a 
great extent to these two orders. Everywhere was noticeable a long- 
ing for knowledge. Attempts were made to master and penetrate by 
means of reason the faith which had at first been accepted by the new 
nations as something given. At the saine time the chief works of the 
Aristotelian philosophy became known. Thus arose the problem of har- 
monizing and combining faith and science, theology and philosophy. 
This problem found its solution in the great formation of systems of 
the thirteenth century. 
This new intellectual world developed the universities as its 
organs and bearers. Paris, the first great university of the occident, 
was the seat of the new theologic-philosophic speculation. From this 
university (ex diluvio scientiarum studti Parisiensis) the German uni- 
versities may be said to have derived their origin. However, the uui- 
versities of Italy that had an independent origin, especially Bologna, 
which developed from a law school, were not without influence upon 
the German institutions. 
While the oldest universities of Italy, France, Spain, and England 
reach with their roots into the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the 
German universities date their beginning from the second half of the 
fourteenth century. Prague and Vienna were the first foundations; the 
former established by the house of Luxemburg in 1348, the latter by 
the house of Hapsburg in 1365; both were situated near the eastern 
border of German culture, evidently because Paris was near enough to 
western Germany, and the ancient clerical schools on the Rhine, espe- 
cially that of Cologne, were in intimate contact with Paris. Toward 
the end of the century western Germany began with the establish- 
ment of universities at Heidelberg (1385) and Cologne (1388); central 
termany followed with Erfurt (1392); the two last named were munic- 
ipal institutions. The temporary dispersion of the professors of the 
University of Paris consequent upon the notable church schism con- 
tributed a large share toward the necessity of establishing these three
-P-A-G-E-282
  
  
  254 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
German universities. Cologne had Jong been one of the most promi- 
nent seats of scientific clerical education. Here in the school of the 
Dominicans Albertus Magnus and Thomas of Aquinas, and in the 
school of the Menorites Duns Scotus, had taught. As a recompense 
for the loss of the University of Prague, Germany received Leipzig 
(1409) and the Baltic countries Rostock (1419). The confusion caused 
by the changed constitution of the University of Prague, suggested by 
John Huss, gave rise to the establishment of the universities of Leipzig 
and Rostock. 
Of all these seven institutions only two have ceased to be. Cologne 
and Erfurt, which during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries stood it 
the front rank, went down with the clerical governments to which they 
- belonged, giving way before the storms that swept Europe in the wake 
of the French Revolution, a movement that was fatal to many ancient 
universities. Cologne succumbed in 1794, Erfurt in 1816. 
A second epoch of university foundations dates from the beginning © 
of the humanistic movement. This epoch has called into existence nine 
German universities: Greifswald (1456); Freiburg (1457); Basel (1460); 
Ingolstadt (1472); Trier (Treves, 1473) ; Mayence (1477) ; Tiibingen(1477); 
Wittenberg (1502), and Frankfurt-on-the-Oder (1506). Four of these are 
still flourishing in their ancient localities, namely, Greifswald, Freiburg, 
Basel, and Tiibingen. Trier and Mayence, the universities of the two 
archbishoprics, never having gained great importance, ceased to be when 
toward the close of the last century the ecclesiastical states went down. 
The remaining three at the beginning of the century either changed 
their locality or lost their independence. Ingolstadt was first moved 
to Landshut (1802), then to Munich (1826); Wittenberg was combined 
with Halle (1817), Frankfurt with Breslau (1811). 
Before I show the organization and work of teaching of the univer- 
sities in the Middle Ages, I insert a word concerning the term univer- 
sity. The real title of the educational institution was Studiwm generale, 
in contradistinction to Studium particulare, which was a local school. 
The university was called general school, because it was intended 
for entire Christendom without regard for nationalor territorial bound- 
aries. Degrees acquired here were recognized all over the Christian 
world. The term “universitas” did not at first signify the institu- 
tion, but the political corporation of teachers and scholars that had _ 
acquired, through various exemptions and privileges, the character and 
position of a legal public body. Hence we see them mentioned as wni- 
versitas magistrorum et scolarium Parisiis ewistentium, as universitas 
studii Pragensis, Viennensis. Gradually the term “universitas” dis- 
placed the other, and was modified in wniversitas literarum, and, as 
such, meant both the corporation of persons and the institution. 
Foundation.—The German universities have not, like the first Freneh 
and Italian, grown gradually, but were founded according to matured 
plans. State and clerical powers worked together in founding them.

  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 250. 
The Pope established the educational institution by means of a bull, 
granting it the privilege of conferring degrees whereby it received the 
character of studium generale or privilegiatum. According to the views 
held during the Middle Ages, the ability and right to teach emanated 
from the church. But gradually the Emperor assumed the right of 
establishment in competition with the Pope. It was derived from the 
Imperial or Roman Jaw, the representative of which was the German 
Emperor, upon whom, as was supposed, had descended the preroga- 
tives of the Roman Emperors.. The head of the separate state, the local 
prince, on the other hand, furnished to the stwdiwm generale the sub- 
stantial means for existence; he appeared in every case as the real 
founder; he secured from the clergy or the Emperor a bull of estab- 
lishment (a charter); he furnished an income by land grants or real 
estate; this income he secured by investing it in church prebends 
already existing and founded for this purpose; he equipped teachers 
and students with corporative rights, granted exemptions from secular 
judiciary, self-government, exemption from taxes, and other privileges. 
Organization.—The first German universities exhibited a twofold 
organization; the educational institution was divided into four facul- 
ties, the political corporation into four nations, following in this the 
Parisian example; the former organization having reference to the cur- 
riculum of studies and order of examinations, the other to jurisdiction 
and management. At the head of the faculties stood the deans; at the 
head of the entire wniversitas stood the concilium or the senate; at the 
_head of the nations the procurators. The universities of later date 
have dropped the division into nations; the faculties displaced the 
nations, and in a measure compensated for their loss. But the remem- 
brance of the old constitution has remained alive in the fact that the 
rector could be elected by the scholars; princes and patrons were some- 
times distinguished by this honor which thereby reflected upon the 
corporation. : 
Attendance.—Tradition in this case, as in every other, is generous 
with large numbers. It tells of thousands and tens of thousands that 
studied at one timein Prague and Vienna as well as Paris and Oxford. 
These reports seem to be upheld in a great degree by the rolls of ma- 
triculation that have been preserved and recently published. If the 
annual number of matriculates amounted to five hundred or a thousand, 
the sum total of students, taking a four or six years’ course into consid- 
eration, would seem to come near the traditional statement. Careful 
eensideration of possibilities and a critical use of documentary re- 
sources, has led to the assumption of much more modest figures. This 
is not the place to enter into details; it is reasonable to assume, that 
the greatest German universities never counted more than two thousand 
supposita (the technical term for matriculated members), and the smaller 
ones a few hundred or less. The great majority of the students be- 
longed to the faculty of arts and letters, which has been called the
-P-A-G-E-284
  256 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
philosophical faculty ever since the sixteenth century. Of the three 
higher faculties which had comparatively a small attendance, the fac- 
ulty of law, as a rule, was best frequented; after that followed the theo- 
logical; the medical faculty was generally the most insignificant. 
Regulations of life and conduct.—The university of the Middle Ages 
had little similarity to the German university of to-day. It can be 
best characterized by saying it was a big boarding school. Teachers 
and students, at least those of the faculty of arts, lived together in 
the buildings of the university. Every university had collegia (the 
colleges of the Englishman, in Germany the term colleg now means 
lecture) and often a pedagogium (a preparatory school) for younger 
students in Latin. 
When, in consequence of increased attendance, the halls and dormi- 
tories of the university proved insufficient for all the students, pri- 
vate houses of professors were included in the university. These pri- 
vate boarding houses were termed burses (this term also stcod for col- 
leges; the German Bursch, meaning the inmates of a burse, has led to 
the application Bursch for student.) The life in these halls was regu- 
lated according to the plan of a convent. A great number of ancient 
university statutes make this very plain. We find in such a house 
rooms for common use, such as sleeping apartinents, dining halls, study 
and lecture rooms, and a conference room for the faculty, besides rooms 
for individuals, for the professors, cells and chambers for the students, 
which could not be heated. Presuppositions for these institutions are, 
on the one hand, celibacy on the part of the professor; on the other, 
juvenile age of the scholars, about 15 to 20 years on an average. The 
whole life was regulated in the minutest details by rules established 
and maintained by the university: time for rising and retiring, the two 
meals (prandium and cena, at about 10 a. m. and 5 p. m.), dress (natur- 
ally it was of a clerical cut), instruction, hours for repetition (reswmp- 
tiones), everything was regulated. There were also a number of pro- 
hibitory rules, against making noise, strolling, carrying arms, bringing 
women into the building, etc. Itis natural to suppose, and if necessary, 
could be proven from numerous documents, that in those times, as is 
done to-day, various ways were invented for the purpose of cireumvent- 
ing the law. : 
The teachers.—In the higher faculties the number of lecturers was 
not large; three to six theologians, about as many jurists, and one or 
two professors of medicine made quite a stately university. The pro- 
fessors of theology and law enjoyed, as a rule, the benefices of a clerical 
' prebendary incorporated in the university; the medical lecturers 
devoted themselves to the profession of medicine, and were considered 
of the least importance in the university. The activity of the regular 
professors was supplemented by reading tutors or baccalaureates. 
The number of lecturers in the faculty of arts and letters like that of 
the students was very much greater than in the other three faculties; it
-P-A-G-E-285
    
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 257 
may. have risen to twenty or thirty in large universities. The older 
professors held positions in the colleges, sometimes also small pre- 
bendaries, but the majority were without fixed income, hence dependent 
upon examination and tuition fees, the proceeds of boarding, private 
pupils and other sources. To act as professor in this faculty of arts 
was not considered a lasting profession, but a transitional period, a 
stepping stone, as it were. Very often the lecturers in the faculty of 
arts were at the same time students in one of the higher faculties 
studying for a degree. They either succeeded in gaining a professorship 
for life, or entered the church which provided for their maintenance. 
The curricula of studies—When the boy of 15 or 16 years left the 
particular or preparatory school, where he had acquired the learned 
language, Latin, to enter the stwdiwm generale, his first business was to 
be enrolled by the rector in the matricula of the university, for which he 
had to pay a fee, which fee was frequently remitted propter pauperta tem, 
or ob reverentiam (this was done with well-known scholars, or with stu- 
dents recommended by them). Then he applied to a lecturer in the 
faculty of arts for admission to the number of hisstudents. With the aid 
of older students, the professors and the dean, he went through the for- 
malities of the “beanium” (act of initiation consisting of symbolic 
actions that signified to him the entrance into the worid of academic 
culture); thus he became a student. Now he began to participate in 
the prescribed lectures and exercises of the faculty of arts, unless he. 
was too far behind in age or in knowledge of Latin; in this case he was 
assigned to the pedagogium, or given over to a tutor in order to acquire 
knowledge of the learned language. 
The course in arts was one of three or four years; it consisted of 
two parts, which were separated by the first examination. After about 
two years’ study, which consisted chiefly of logic and physics, the stu- 
dent applied for admission to the first examination. Having proved 
thathe had attended the prescribed lectures, participated in the required 
discussions, and acquired the amount of knowledge necessary, he re- 
ceived in public the first academic degree, that of baecalarius (after- 
wardscalled baccalaureus). Examinations and promotions took place at 
stated times; an entire group of students was promoted together, so 
that to each one could be assigned a place according to the result of 
the examination. After another two years’ successful study, consist- 
ing of the whole range of philosophical sciences, physics, and mathe- 
matics, with astronomy, metaphysics and psychology, ethics, and politi- 
eal economy, be was examined again, and received his second promo- 
tion, the degree magister artium being conferred upon him. Similar to 
this was the course in the higher faculties. 
It is worthy of note that the new master of arts was, as a rule, re- 
quired to spend a few years in reading in the faculty of arts (biennium 
complere). It appears that the authorities had a double object in view; 
first, the preservation of the institution; without such obligatory duties 
ED 92. 17   Co ae 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
    258 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
as teacher, the number of teachers in the faculty of arts would have 
been inadequate, salaries being scanty and well-endowed chairs very 
few. But there must have been this other weighty consideration, that 
the young masters of arts were thus obliged to keep fresh the knowl- 
edge gained; with Aristotle, the leaders of the universities of the Middle 
Ages believed that no one can know anything unless he be able to com- 
municate it to others. According to this the baccalarius was called 
upon to participate actively, and not only passively, in the instruction, 
both in lectures and disputations. The gradation, scolaris, baccalarius, 
and magister, is evidently the same that we find in the handicrafts of 
the Middle Ages, apprentice, journeyman, and master. The apprentice 
learned; the journeyman learned, produced, and if occasion offered, 
taught; the master produced and taught. In the particular or lower 
schools of those times we find the same steps; scholar, assistant (socius, 
also called baccalarius), and schoolmaster. 
We must, however, guard against the impression that completing 
the entire course of the faculty of arts and a course in one of the higher 
faculties was the rule. Most of the students left the university be- 
fore even obtaining the lowest degree, that of bachelor of arts. Such 
cases are very rare at present; the rule now is to complete the course. 
The cause is obvious; it is that no office in the gift of the Government 
or municipalties can be obtained without the completion of a university 
eourse, and each office presupposes a certain well-defined course of 
preparation. That was not the case in the Middle Ages; not even 
attendance upon a university seems to have been the condition for fill- 
ing an office. The absolutely necessary condition of an office in the . 
gift of the church was priestly ordination, and, in fact, there were 
seareely any secular offices. Previous to the ordination the bishop 
examined the candidates; he required barely more than some knowledge 
in Latin. As late as at the end of the fifteenth century a great num. 
ber of clergymen had never attended a university, but it may be sup- 
posed that such attendance had become a duty of decorum for the 
higher clergy. In the cathedral chapters a certain number of positions 
were frequently reserved for graduates in theology. Also, knowledge 
of law proved more and more necessary for the higher clergy; for the 
lower positions, however, the degree of master or bachelor of arts was 
an important recommendation, and the mere certificate of matricula- 
tion from a university secured to the owner a preference over other 
candidates. As proof of this fact may be regarded the rotuli which 
the oldest university sent from time to time to the clergy; they were 
lists of all the members of the university, arranged according to their 
aeademie rank, down to the simplest student, and they all appear as 
applicants for benefices. 
Contents and form of instruction.—The contents of instruction ap- 
peared to the Middle Ages as given and final; the object was to trans- 
mit the fixed inventory of scientific knowedge; for theology deriving its 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 259 
knowledge in the last instance from the revelation, the Holy Scriptures 
(sacra pagina) were the supreme source of decisive authority. To be 
sure, for their comprehension, the interpretation of the church was 
determinative, and, from the fact that the contents of faith had to be 
arranged and systematized by meaus of human reason, the great theo- 
logical systems of the Middle Ages arose, which became the real objects 
of theological instruction. In the law faculty the great-collections of 
Roman and canonic laws formed both sources and substance of instruc- 
tion; commentaries and glossaries were called in for aid. The medical 
faculty, likewise, derived the substance of its-instruction essentially 
from some authors of canonic reputation; above all, the writings of 
Hippocrates and Galenus, with a few of their Arabic commentators. 
Finally, the faculty of arts taught the philosophic, that is, all purely 
theoretic sciences, as far as they could be derived from human reason. 
Here, too, the substance of instruction was found in canonic text books, 
especially the writings of Aristotle, mathematics in Euclid, astronomy 
in Ptolemzeus; besides these, a few more modern text-books were used, 
such as the Summula Petri Hispani and the Sphera of Johannes de 
Sacro Basco. 
As far as the form of instruction is concerned, we find everywhere 
during the Middle Ages two organically combined parts, lecture and 
disputation. : 
The object of the lecture was the transmission of scientific knowledge. 
A canonic text, for instance, some passage of Aristotle (naturally in 
Latin translation) was read and explained, not dictated. A text-book 
was supposed to be in the hands of the students. At times the pro- 
fessor read from the text, in order to insert the proper punctua- 
tion and correction, but the main point always was the explanation. 
The versus memoriales, in which the explanation of law text was 
arranged, may be considered to have been in vogue for other texts 
also, perhaps with slight adaptations. Here is an example: 
Praemitto, scindo, summo, casumque figuro, 
Perlego, do causas, connoto, objicio. 
The object of the disputations was exercise in the application of scien- 
tific knowledge, above all the solution of mooted questions. The dis- 
putations appear to have been as important as the lectures. When at 
stated times public disputations took place, the whole faculty, masters 
and students, appeared in gowns. One of the masters, acting as chair- 
man, proposed a series of theses; the other masters in turn attacked 
his deductions with syllogistically arranged arguments. ‘The bachelors 
as respondents defended the theses, by analyzing the arguinents, aided 
by the chairman when necessary. Beside these formal disputations at 
-which the students remained silent listeners, there were preparatory 
disputations conducted by masters and bachelors for the practice of the 
students. The Middle Ages laid much weight upon these learned dis- 
putations. Their number was determined beforehand, and attendance
-P-A-G-E-288
260 — EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
at them was obligatory; masters who were lax in arranging them were 
threatened with fines. In fact the real power of university instruction 
emanated from these public discussions. There is no doubt that this 
was well understood; these discussions were a splendid means for 
securing acquisition of knowledge, as well as for practice in its appli- 
cation. They were well adapted to prove the presence of original | 
knowledge, as well as skill in comprehending the thoughts of others 
and their relation to one’s own thoughts. It may be presumed that in 
these two things the learned men of the Middle Ages had a mastery 
not easily found now-a days. The scholar of to-day depends for many 
things upon reference books, while a man in the Middle Ages had to 
charge his memory with them. Again, the ability to logically present 
and defend one’s views face to face with an opponent who supports his 
own, and in his defense tries to dissipate the discussion and lead one 
astray, this ability is not developed much now, hence is rarely found. 
Of course, such public disputations are not. possible any longer in 
our universities. They presuppose two things that do not exist any 
more: (1) living together of teachers and students in colleges and halls, 
and (2) a certain inventory of generally acknowledged philosophic prin- 
ciples, or in other words, an authoritative school philosophy, such as the 
Middle Ages had in Aristotle for their faculty of arts. It was seen 
clearly enough that “contra principia negantem non est disputandum.” 
Since the sixteenth century these two conditions gradually dwindled 
in importance, and, finally, during the nineteenth century disappeared 
entirely. The once famous university disputations were first discred- 
ited, then abandoned; only a rudimentary fragment has been preserved 
as a reminder of the past, in the formal disputations on the occasion of 
granting the degree of doctor. 
B.—IN MODERN TIMES. 
The modern time began in that grand revolut:onary era which is filled 
with the Renaissance and the Reformation. These two powerful move- 
ments cut deep into the life of the universities. 
The conquest of the German universities by the humanities took 
place during the first two decades of the sixteenth century. An exas- 
perating conflict between the old and the new raged during that time. 
The entire customary management of the universities, especially the 
instruction in the faculties of arts and theology, was rejected with the 
utmost contempt by the new culture and its representatives, the poets 
and orators, who, as may be said in passing, had here and there raised 
their voices similarly during the second half of the fifteenth century. 
Form and contents of that instruction appeared to them as the most 
disgraceful barbarism that could not be enough abhorred. Hatred and 
horror on the part of the humanities against the ancient character of 
the universities have created for themselves a lasting monument in the 
Lpistole obscurorum virorum which were issued at about 1516, by a 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
    
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 261 
group cf young poets in Erfurt whose head was Mutian. Among the 
men who represented the scientific power of the humanities, Desiderius 
Erasmus and Reuchlin deserve to be mentioned first. The latter intro- 
duced the study of Hebrew into Germany, and gave fruitful sugges- 
tions for the study of Greek. Erasmus, a man of astonishing talent 
and power of work, taught the Germans a simple, natural, and elegant 
Latin, awakened among them a susceptibility for higher culture, planned 
the way for philologic-historic investigation everywhere, and finally, 
by means of his studies of the New Testament, brought the humani- 
ties into contact with theology. That the systems of scholastic theol- 
ogy were led back to the original sources and the ancient fathers, is 
preeminently his work. It is noteworthy that Erasmus declined 
repeatedly a chair in a university that was frequently and urgently 
offered him. j 
The new education was victorious upon the whole line. It had per- 
meated all the great universities »s early as 1520. New courses of 
study afforded room for the new branches, both in instruction and 
examination. Two pointsare particularly prominent. (1) The ancient 
Church Latin was replaced by classic Latin; Roman authors, especi- 
ally the poets, were made the subject of the lectures with the intention 
of inducing imitation; the ancient translations of Aristotelian texts 
were replaced by humanistic translations. (2) The Greek language 
was introduced into the course of the faculty of arts; in all universi- 
ties chairs for Greek language and literature were established. Among 
the first professors of Greek in German universities the most promi- 
nent were Reuchlin, who taught in Tiibingen and Ingolstadt, Melanch- 
then in Wittenberg, P. Mosellanus in Leipzig; among the professors 
of Latin, Conrad Celtes in Vienna, Eobanus Hessus in Erfurt, and H. 
Bebel in Tiibingen, deserve to be mentioned first. 
But after 1520 the humanistic, that is, the aristocratic secular move- 
ment, was overtaken and replaced by an infinitely more powerful and 
deeper movement, namely, the popular religious movement of the . 
Reformation. For a moment the Reformation appeared as a reinforce- 
ment of the humanities; both movements agreed in their hatred of 
scholastic philosophy and of Rome. Hutten’s and Luther’s pictures 
were printed side by side in pamphlets of the year 1520 and termed the 
great champions of liberty. But really they were very different men, 
-and very different were the aims to which they intended to guide the 
German people—Luther, the man of intense anti-rationalistic and anti- 
Church religiosity ; Hutten, the man of rationalistic libertinistic human- 
ism. Hutten did not live to see this great contrast revealed; during 
the years 1522-3 the eyes of the humanists were opened concerning the 
aims of the Reformation and nearly all of them turned away from it, 
because it was more hostile to the higher studies than even the ancient 
Church, and, indeed, it appeared at first as though the Reformation, in 
its effect, would become essentially hostile to the higher education. The  
-P-A-G-E-290
  262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
universities and schools declined and almost entirely vanished during 
the frightful storms of the third decade. Wherever the Church fell 
the institutions of learning it had developed fell with it, so that Eras- 
mus could say: “ Ubi regnat Lutheranismus, ibi interitus literarum,” 
But the last word had not been spoken in this cause. In some man- 
ner the federation between the Reformation and humanism remained 
intact, namely, in the person of Melanchthon. Through long, noiseless 
activity and joyful labor this man planted and nursed the humanistic 
studies in German universities and schools, despite the unpropitious 
times. For more than forty years (1518-1560) he lectured at Witten- 
berg upon all philosophic and philologic-historic branches as they 
were then understood. Almost alone he represented an entire philo- 
sophic faculty. During the fourth decade Wittenberg became the most 
popular university. From all parts of Germany and all the countries of 
Europe young men came together there. When Melanchthon died ~ 
there was scarcely a town in Protestant Germany in which there was 
not a grateful pupil of his who lamented the death of the Preceptor 
Germanie. His grammatical and philosophic text-books remained 
in use in schools and universities long after his death. 
The development of the German universities, as it took place sub- 
sequently under the influence of humanism and the Reformation, may 
be divided into three sections: 
(1) The era of confessional universities, maintained by the churches of 
the petty states. It extended from the time of Luther to the end of the 
seventeenth century, and was characterized by the preponderance of 
theologic-confessional interests. The faculty of theology stood in the 
foreground. - 
(2) The era of development of modern philosophy and culture in the 
universities. It may be said to have covered the eighteenth century 
and was characterized by the rising importance of philosophy and the 
philosophic and law faculties. Halle and Gottingen were the leading 
institutions. 
(3) The era of the greatest influence of German universities upon 
the thoughts and life of the nation. It embraces the nineteenth century, 
and was characterized at first by the predominance of philosophy; later 
by the progressive development of minute scientific investigation in 
nature and history. The philosophic faculty stands in the foreground; 
besides the medical faculty assumes greater importance than ever 
before. 
The first epoch—the confessional universities.—With the close of the 
peasants’ war (1525) the first act of the great religious conflict had termi- 
nated. The second act began with the establishment of new churches 
upon a Protestant basis. Each petty state having its own church 
organization, it followed that the universities were closely connected 
with the church during the next two centuries. The ancient institutions 
of learning were restored in accordance with the new chureh consti-
-P-A-G-E-291
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 263 
  tution both on the Protestant and Catholic side; also a great number 
of new ones were founded. 
The first of the new Protestant institutions was the Hessian Univer- 
sity of Marburg (1527). This was followed by Kénigsberg (1544) in the 
Grand Duchy of Prussia, which had just been changed from a clerical 
to a secular possession. Then came Jena (1556) in the remaining 
portion of the possessions of the Saxon house of Ernest, after Witten- 
berg had fallen to the Saxon house of Albert. Despite the small- 
ness of the state it served and the scarcity of its means, this institu- 
tion has maintained an honorable place among the German universities 
to the present day. In 1576 a university was founded at Helmstiidt in 
Brunswick. This institution was equipped well, and was, during the 
seventeenth century, one of the most noted Protestant seats of learning. 
Especially noteworthy were the theclogian Calixtus and the polyhisto- 
rian H. Conring, who may justly be called the founder of the science 
of history of German law. The two institutions founded by the impe- 
rial municipalities, Altdorf and Strassburg, belonged to the most noted 
universities of the seventeenth century. The former arose froma gym- 
nasium, which was transferred from Nuremberg in 1573 and made a uni- 
iversity in 1622; the latter grew out of a similar school belonging to the 
city of Strassburg (in 1621). Of less importance was Giessen (1607), 
founded to represent the Lutheran faith in Hesse-Darmstadt, having 
branched off from Marburg; likewise Rinteln in Schaumburg (1621). 
The same may be said of the university of Duisburg (1655), which 
represented the Reformed Church. More important was the univer- 
sity of Kiel, founded in 1665 for the duchies Schleswig-Holstein. Be- 
sides the aforementioned real universities, quite a number of so-called 
academic gymnasia existed during that time. They were institutions 
of secondary education which maintained post-graduate courses of 
philosophic and theologic lectures. These institutions partly continued 
their existence into our present century, asin Hamburg. The school 
of the Reformed Church at Herborn had a great reputation during the 
seventeenth century. 
This era shows numerous new establishments also in the Catholic 
countries. The first was at Dillingen, founded by the bishop of Augs- 
burg in 1549, For a time this university was the center of scientific 
study of Catholic Germany. Then followed Wiirzburg (1582), splen- 
didly equipped by Prince Bishop Julius; then Paderborn (1615), Salz- 
burg (1623), Osnabriick (1630), Bamberg (1648), all of which were 
founded by bishops. Lastly we mast mention the universities estab- 
lished in the countries belonging to the house of Hapsburg: Olmiitz 
(1581), Graz (1586), Linz (1636), and Innsbruck (1672). However, 
many of these Catholic institutions never became complete universities, 
but were privileged philosophic-theological schools, mostly conducted 
by Jesuits. Few had law faculties. 
Generally speaking, it may be said that the institutions established    
-P-A-G-E-292
264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  during this first epoch of the modern era did not show the vitality 
exhibited by the old universities of the Middle Ages. Of the ten newly 
founded Protestant universities only five are still active: Marburg, 
Jena, Kénigsberg, Giessen, and Kiel, to which must be added the re- 
opened university of Strassburg (1871). Helmstiidt, Rinteln, Duisburg, 
and Altdorf were suspended during the great Napoleonic revolution that 
overthrew the German states at the beginning of our century. Like- 
wise the universities established by the bishops were suspended after 
the fall of clerical government, except Wiirzburg, which has been pre- 
served as a royal Bavarian university. Of the others only certain 
parts are preserved in form of theological seminaries. Of the Austrian 
universities only Graz and Innsbruck remain alive. 
The chief impulse for the numerous new foundations mentioned was 
the importance which the idea of state assumed, both in religious and 
political affairs. Each state endeavored to have its own university; - 
first, in order to secure the preservation of the faith represented by the 
church of the state; secondly, to save the citizens the trouble of 
attending the university in what was then considered a foreign country, 
and to keep the money at home. When the means of maintaining the 
institution were insufficient (we must not think them to have been very 
extravagant; a few thousand florins or thalers sufficed to pay the sala- 
ries of ten or twelve professors, a sequestered cloister offered the required 
rooms, and other university institutions were not known), post-graduate 
courses of lectures were added to existing secondary schools, thereby 
changing them to gymnasia academica or illustre. For such institutions 
the privileges of a university could be secured afterward from the 
Emperor, and were not very difficult to obtain. 
This then explains why the universities of this first epoch lacked the 
universality of those of the Middle Ages. Interterritorial and interna- 
tioual right of changing one’s domicil, which had characterized the 
studium generale, was lost. If not the boundaries of the state, then cer- 
tainly those of the confession became synonymous with the boundaries 
of the university dominion. However, even at that time the inborn 
migratory desire of the German student would not be fettered. The 
control of what was taught in that epoch was more rigid than in any 
previous or subsequent age. The dread of heresy, the painful rigidity 
with which the orthodoxy of the faith was preserved, was found in the 
Protestant as well as in the Catholic world, perhaps greater among the 
Protestants, since a departure was possible in two directions, to the 
right toward Catholicism, to the left toward Calvinism. 
Imprisonment of the intellectual life within confessionalism stamped 
this epoch as the one that farthest departed from the real inner life of 
the nation in the entire course of its history. 
If we cast a glance at the inner arrangement and management of the 
universities of the epoch mentioned, we shall see that, generally speak- 
ing, the ancient forms had been preserved. The four faculties had

  remained, and with them the fundamental plan of the curriculum and 
order of examination, The degree of bachelor of arts gradually disap- 
peared during the sixteenth century, and the magister was replaced 
in the higher faculties by the more aristocratic doctor. Only the degree 
of master of arts was retained until the beginning of the nineteenth 
century. 
The theological faculty was the most prominent of all, and had gained 
in real importance, for at that time the study of theology had become 
a requisite for the entire clergy, which was not the case in the Middle 
Ages. A consequence of this was that doctrines and dogmas became 
more important than divine worship, at first in the Protestant, later 
alsoin theCatholic world. While thus Protestantism influenced Catholi- 
cism, it was subject to a counter effect, that is, it was drawn back 
to scholastic dogmatism from its original tendency of Bible study. 
The Bible is not a structure of doctrines, the formulas and definitions 
of which are suitable for controversy and the exclusion of heretics. 
The law faculty also gained in importance and extension in exact 
proportion to the development of the modern state and the increase of 
its army of officers. The learned judge gradually displaced the igno- 
rant lay judge, and the state officer who had a university education 
replaced the feudal knight. The form of instruction also changed in 
this way, the systematic presentation of science repelled the interpre- 
tation of canonic texts; the “mos Gallicus” replaced the “mos Itali- 
cus.” 
The medical faculty remained the weakest of all up to the nineteenth 
century; however its mode of teaching and its curriculum began quite 
early to exhibit remarkable changes. Astronomy and physiology began 
to be freed from traditions and ancient texts and be based upon individ- 
ual observation. 
The philosophic faeulty, formerly called “facultas artium,” generally 
kept its old position. It remained the link between the preparatory 
schools that taught the languages and the higher faculties that offered 
scientific professional education. Its main object was to supplement the 
previous school instruction by a course in the general or philosophical 
sciences. The substance of this instruction consisted, as heretofore, in 
the writings of Aristotle upon logic, physics, psychology, metaphysics, 
ethics, and political economy, sometimes in Latin (during the sixteenth 
_ century it was the aim, attained only in a limited measure, to apply the 
Greek original text), or in translations and texts for which Melanchthon 
had given the example. Side by side with the philosophic course ran a 
course in the humanities consisting in lectures on the classics and 
exercises in clocution and poetry; but this course lost power and impor- 
tance the more the age of humanism receded. From the middle of the 
seventeenth century the making of Latin verses was gradually aban- 
doned. French language and literature began to predominate in the 
courts, where for more than a hundred years it ruled supreme. The

classic humanistic education now suffered the same reverse which it 
had caused to scholastic education in the Middle Ages at the begin- 
ning of the sixteenth century, and became old-fashioned and ridiculous. 
The professors of rhetoric, elocution, and poetry were profuse in their 
complaints concerning the contempt for fine arts and the returning bar- 
barism of the Middle Ages. 
The former order of life and conduct was abandoned also, when the 
power of the Church was broken. The living together in colleges as in 
monasteries presupposed celibacy on the part of the masters. Besides, 
the average age of the students had increased perceptibly; for the 
unprecedented development of the lower schools, especially the court 
and state schools in the Protestant countries and in Jesuit colleges in 
the Catholic countries, led to an extension of the school courses. The 
abandonment of monastic life was also urged by the higher faculties 
which had neyer quite submitted to its rigid rules, and which now in- 
creased in importance perceptibly. 
During the eighteenth century it was customary for professors to 
give students board and lodging in their houses. But it must not be 
left unnoticed that in most universities a sort of dormitory was estab- 
lished in which a number of indigent students were kept at public 
expense, and where their studies were supervised. As a recompense 
such students had to agree to serve their country either in secular 
offices or in the service of church and school. This dormitory was 
ealled “convict.” Similar to this arrangement certain state schools 
were established in which talented boys were prepared for the univer- 
sity at public expense. The means for both the convicts and these 
preparatory schools were derived from sequestered church property. 
These institutions existed essentially unchanged until the beginning 
of the seventeenth century. 
At the close of this epoch, the universities in Germany had fallen to 
the lowest degree of influence and fame. They appeared as superan- 
nuated and almost degenerated institutions in comparison with the 
progressive culture that had its center at the princely courts. A man 
like Leibniz refused to accept a position in a university; he preferred 
the princely courts, where he was sure to find comprehension and pro- 
motion of his ideas and extensive plans. The universities were almost 
without any perceptible influence upon the life and thoughts of the peo- 
ple. The number of university teachers during the seventeenth cen- 
tury whose names have been perpetuated in the memory of the learned 
world is insignificant in comparison with that of the sixteenth and 
eighteenth centuries. It is well known, also, that the greatest de- 
generacy in student life occurred during this epoch. Drinking and 
quarrelling (Saufen and Raufen) were not only related to each other 
in ryhme, but flourished to such an extent in the middle of the seven- 
teeth century that serious steps had to be taken on the part of the 
state authorities to gradually reestablish some semblance of order.

    GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 267 
The second epoch; the eighteenth century.—This epoch began. with 
two new foundations: Halle (1694) and Géttingen (1737), to which 
was added Erlangen (1743) for the Frankish principalities Ansbach- 
Baireuth. These three universities are still flourishing. The Catho- 
lies provided Breslau and Miinster. In Breslau (1702) a philosophie- 
theologic seminary of the Jesuits was furnished with university privi- 
leges, but it did not develop into a complete university until its reor- 
ganization in 1811, when the university of Frankfort on the Oder was 
transferred to Breslau and connected with the institution at that place. 
Miinster, founded in 1780 as a university for the archbishopric of 
Cologne, exists since 1818 as an academy of two faculties, philosophy 
and theology. 
Halle, the university of the rising Brandenburg-Prussian state, owes 
its fame, above all, to three men, to wit, the jurist, Chr. Thomasius, the 
first who urged the modern study of law; the theologian, A. H. Francke, 
and the philosopher, Chr. Wolff. Thomasius, a pupilof Samuel Pufen- 
dorff, the first teacher of natural law in a German university (in Heidel- 
berg, 1626, the first chair for the new treatment of law was estab- 
lished), was a man of the modern French court culture; he was the 
editor of the first monthly magazine in the German language (1688), 
and also the first who introduced the German language into the lecture 
room. He despised scholastic philosophy and humanistic eloquence, as 
well as theological orthodoxy and ancient learned jurisprudence; with 
his own university in Leipzig, where he taught as assistant professor, 
he engaged in serious controversies; hence he was obliged toresign. He 
then established himself in Halle, where he found a hearty welcome. 
The group of students that gathered around him at Halle became the 
nucleus of the university which was opened in 1694. The theological 
faculty received its peculiar direction from Francke, the chief repre- 
sentative of Pietism; he, too, had been expelled from orthodox Leip- 
zig. His theology culminated in practical Christianity and Bible study 
conducted with pure faith. The grandinstitution of the orphan asylum 
in Halle, which was founded by him, became a model school for his 
students for the practice of Christianity and the instruction of the 
young. During the second halfof the century Joh. Sal. Semler taught 
in the theological faculty of Halle; he was the founder of historical or 
the higher criticism of the Holy Scriptures. 
But of the greatest importance was the philosophy of Chr. Wolff, 
who taught in the philosophic faculty at Halle, from 1707 to 1723, and 
then again from 1740 to 1754, From 1723 to 1740 he taught at Marburg. 
His expulsion during the reign of Frederick William I, and his trium- 
phant reestablishment through Frederick the Great, signifies the great 
turning point of the epoch. The acceptation of his philosophy may be 
said to signify the end of scholastic philosophy in German universities. 
From that time, modern philosophy in the form of Wolff’s system took 
possession of the universities of Germany. Until then, it had been the
-P-A-G-E-296
  268 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
object of instruction in philosophy, generally, to transmit and master the 
former school philosophy (Aristotle in Melanchthon’s garb) by means 
of recitations. Philosophy had been studied essentially for the pur- 
pose of formal preparation for theology. The new philosophy planted 
itself firmly upon reason. Rational Thoughts is the chief title of Wolff’s 
works in the German language. It did not intend to be ancilla theo- 
logie, but to seek the truth without prejudice; its basis was found in 
mathematics and natural sciences in their modern form. With equal 
emphasis it denied transcendental sanctions for ethics and law; it based 
itself solely upon the nature of man and society. 
Wolft’s philosophy was triumphant in all Protestant universities in 
the course of the eighteenth century. The higher faculties also, especi- 
ally theology and law, submitted to the influence of Rational Thoughts. 
Rationalism with its motto: “Nothing without satisfactory cause,” 
became the maxim of the day. 
With this we mark a decisive turn in science. The German unversi- 
ties owe it, above all, to the acceptation of Wolff’s philosophy that 
they were able to extricate themselves from the mire into which they 
had sunk during the seventeenth century, and that they could begin 
to assume the role of leaders in the intellectual life of our people. 
That the universities of our neighbors to the West have not been able 
to assimilate the modern philosophy, that they still occupy the stand- 
point of confessionalism, is really the ultimate cause why they exer- 
cise so much less influence upon the public life of their nations. The 
leading minds in France and England stand outside, in Germany 
inside, the universities. 
Halle has the renown of being the first real modern university; the 
principle of libertas philosophandi, upon which the modern university 
rests, the principle of free investigation and untrammeled teaching 
(freie Forschung and freie Lehre) was first applied at Halle. They 
were clearly conscious of this in Halle. When the university, in 1711, 
celebrated the birthday of its founder, Prof. Gundling delivered an ora- 
tion de libertate Fridericiane. This oration called the youngest uni- 
versity a stronghold of free thought. It concluded with the following 
words: ‘Veritas adhue in medio posito est; qui potest, adscendat, qui 
audet, rapiat: et applaudemus.” A bold word which characterized the 
great change in the intellectual world that had taken place. In the 
ancient university instruction always started from the presupposition 
that the truth was fixed and given, all that was to be done was to 
transmit it, and that the supervisory authority had the duty to see to 
it that no false teaching was transmitted. The modern university 
starts from the presupposition that the truth must be sought, and that 
it is the duty of instruction to enable the student to find it. The uni- 
versity simply realized the consequences of the situation created by 
the Reformation. 
During the second half of the eighteenth century the University of
-P-A-G-E-297
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 269 
  Halle found a rival in that of Géttingen, by which it was overtaken 
later on. At the close of the century Géttingen was considered an aris- 
tocratic university; counts and barons of the holy Roman Empire stud- 
ied law and political science there under Profs. Schlézer and Piitter. 
Mosheim taught church history, theology, and pulpit eloquence; Michae” 
lis taughtorientallanguages; Aibrecht von Haller and his successor, Blu- 
menbach, who were the best representatives of the science of man at that 
time, taught physical anthropology; the astronomer of worldwide fame, 
Tob. Mayer, the ingenuous physicist, Lichtenberg, and the elegant math- 
ematician, Kistner, all these graced the institution. The newly awakened 
science of archeology found in Géttingen its first nursery; its philolo- 
gists, J. M. Gesner and J. G. Heyne, to whom we owe the return of 
Greek to the university, found a new point of view for the study of 
classic authors. It is not dead erudition, nor Latin and Greek imitation 
that is needed, but formative, intimate intercourse with the authors of 
antiquity, the highest models of art and taste. This is the point of view 
of modern humanism, which has given a comprehensible human aim to 
the study of the ancient authors; its object has become the formation’ 
of taste for everything beautiful and genuine in literary representation. 
This modern humanism had a reciprocal action upon German poetry, 
that was just then beginning to flourish. This poetry, also, had its 
central seat in Gottingen; it suffices to mention Haller’s poems, Ges- 
ner’s German Society and the Hainbund. 
If we compare the condition of the German universities at the close 
of the eighteenth century, as it had developed under the leadership of 
Halle and Gottingen, with the condition at the close of the seventeenth 
century, we may group the differences from the following points of view: 
(1) The place of scholastic philosophy had been taken by rationalistie 
philosophy, that accepted no decision by authorities. 
(2) In place of the mechanical treatment of the dead languages and 
imitation had come the animated study of ancient sciences for purposes 
of general human culture. 
(3) In organie connection with this was the fact that the German 
language had displaced Latin as the vehicle of instruction in universi- 
ties. 
(4) Ininstruction the principle of free research and unhindered teach- 
ing had been generally accepted. 
(5) Natural consequences of this were: abandonment of disputations, 
dismissal of text-books, and on the other hand the establishment of 
seminaries. Gesner in Gottingen opened the first philologic seminary; 
F. A. Wolff in Halle followed his example. 
The third epoch; the nineteenth century.—This epoch, like the pre- 
ceding one, is opened with a few important new foundations. First of: 
all came the University of Berlin (1809), established under memorable 
circumstances at the capital of the Prussian state for the purpose of 
proving “that Prussia will not give up the function it has so long 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  
  atk EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
exercised, namely, to work in the direction of higher intellectual culture, 
and in that to seek its real power; it will begin anew. Prussia will 
not be isolated, but desires to remain, not merely in political matters 
but also in regard to culture and civilization, in close contact with entire 
Germany.” ThusSchleiermacherinterpreted (inhis Occasional Thoughts 
Concerning Universities, p. 145, which we may call the intellectual 
charter of the institution) the fundamental idea of the Berlin Univer- 
sity, its historical and national duty. When the venerable university 
of Frankfurt was transferred to Breslau it formed with that institution 
a great modern university (1811). After the Napoleonic wars a new 
university for the western provinces was established at Bonn (1818). 
The new state of Bavaria soon founded a large central university at 
Miinich (1826), in which the ancient University of Ingolstadt was per- 
petuated. Lastly, the reopening or reestablishment of the University 
of Strasburg by the new German Empire (1872) completed the number 
of new foundations. Thus we see political changes reflected in the 
changes which the universities underwent. 
Still another change of vital importance must be mentioned. The 
universities abandoned their former denominational character. When 
the most prominent German states, during the great revolution at the 
beginning of this century, abandoned the confessional unity which 
until then had been preserved, the universities responded in kind. 
They thereby returned to the universality of the ancient “ studium 
generale,” departing from their church basis and placing themselves 
upon the basis of general human culture. The ancient internationality 
also returned, although now it acts in a contrary direction. During 
the Middle Ages the German students went into foreign countries—to 
Paris and Italy; at present the foreigners come to Germany from the 
far West and the far East. 
During this epoch the philosophic faculty has become the most 
prominent in influencing the ideas and the entire intellectual Jife of 
the people. Of well-known and distinguished names‘in science the 
philosophic faculty can justly claim more than the other three faculties 
together, and the number of professors in the philosophical faculty is, 
as a rule, greater in all universities. 
At the beginning of this epoch philosophy stood in the foreground; 
Kant, the sage of Kénigsberg, whose philosophy had followed that of 
Wolff, gained supremacy in all German universities, the Catholic not 
excepted. He was followed by representatives of the speculative phi- 
losophy which for a time had its seat in Jena, where Fichte, Schelling, 
and Hegel taught in the beginning of the nineteenth century; then 
philosophy had its chief center at Berlin, where first Fichte, after him 
Hegel, taught. The latter has exercised great influence upon the entire 
Prussian system of education. This philosophy could be designated, 
during the twenties and thirties, as the Prussian state philosophy ina 
double sense of the word: It was the officially recognized philosophy 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 271 
  of the state, or at least that of the department of education; and, on 
the other hand, Hegel was the admired preacher of the idea of state. 
This condition lasted until Frederick William IV ascended the throne. 
He hated Hegel’s rationalism and called the aged Schelling from 
Miinich to Berlin in order to combat it. Beside Fichte and Hegel, 
Schleiermacher exercised a far-reaching influence through his theologi- 
cal as well as through his philosophical lectures. As a representative 
of another tendency in philosophy, the so-called positive philosophy, 
Herbart (in Géttingen and Kénigsberg) must be mentioned. His 
philosophy has gained great ascendancy since the decline of Hegel, 
especially in Austrian universities. 
Among the intellectual powers of this time must be mentioned the 
modern humanistic philology, which deserves a second place. F, A. 
Wolf, who soon surpassed the aged Heyne, taught first in Halle, then in 
the Berlin University, which had been founded through the active par- 
ticipation of W. von Humboldt (a friend of Wolf); it had been destined 
from the very beginning for a central seat of archeological sciences, 
and has remained true to its destiny to the present day. Here Boeckh, 
Lachmann, and Haupt have taught. Trendelenburg, the restorer of 
Aristotelean philosophy, for many years an influential professor in 
Berlin, combined philosophical with philological study. In this branch 
the other new universities became conspicuous. In Bonn we find 
Niebuhr, Welcker, Brandis, Ritschl; in Munich, Friedrich Thiersch, 
Spengel, Halm; Leipzig maintained its former rank through Gottfried 
Hermann; Gottingen, through Otfried Miiller. 
It is worth recording that a number of new branches of philosophic 
investigation sprang up. Above all, must be mentioned the cultiva- 
tion of Germanistic studies through the brothers Grimm, who lived and 
taught, first at Gottingen, thenin Berlin. To that was added the study 
of Romanic philology, the founder of which was Diez, in Bonn. Also 
the study of Oriental languages and literatures took a fresh impetus. 
It suffices to mention the name of Bopp, the founder of comparative 
philology, ancLof Lepsius, the Egyptologist, both in Berlin, and of Fr. 
Riickert, the great philologist and poet, of whom Erlangen may boast. 
Of very pronounced importance is also the phenomenal development 
of historical investigation. Above all, L. Ranke, in Berlin, is to be 
mentioned as the most influential teacher, who was followed by a long 
line of notable pupils in the direction of research among original his- 
torical sources. It must not be left unnoticed that historical instrue- 
tion in universities in this epoch has had an enormous influence upon 
the political thoughts of the nation. This influence has made itself 
felt particularly in favor of the unification of grand old Germany. Itis 
not a mere accident that the most distinguished professors of history, 
Dahlmann, Waitz, Droysen, Hiusser, played their réles as membefs of 
the parliamentary bodies of 1848. 
Lastly, we mention the impetus which investigation in the mathe-
-P-A-G-E-300
  272 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  matical and natural sciences has received since 1820. In. Géttingen 
the mathematician Gauss and the physicist Weber taught. In Giessen, 
Liebig founded, with comparatively scanty means, a laboratory that 
proved to be of far-reaching consequences, both for chemical instruc- 
tion and the practical application of science. In Berlin Joh. Miiller 
formed a nucleus for the modern school of physiologists, that made it 
its object to explain biological phenomena purely by means of the nat- 
ural sciences without the aid of metaphysical principles. This school 
has had an enormous importance in the development of medical science. 
While thus the first half of our century is distinguished by a long 
line of pioneers in science and by works that laid the basis for future 
labors, the second halfis characterized not so much by a growth in 
depth as by a growth in width. This is particularly true in regard to 
the two great branches of scientific investigation—for the philologic 
historic sciences as well as for mathematics and the natural sciences. 
An ever-increasing specialization in the fields of investigation is a con- 
sequence of this. This becomes obvious in the institutions of the uni- 
versity, where the number of chairs and seminaries for new branches 
of the natural sciences has increased enormously. The number of 
regular professors in the philosophic faculty has increased to double 
and triple of what it was at the beginning of the century. Berlin 
began with twelve such professors; it has now fifty-three, and that 
does not include extraordinary professors and Privat-Docenten. 
If an attempt be made to sketch in a few lines the history of the 
other three faculties of this epoch, that of the theologic faculty might 
be stated in this way: At the beginning of our epoch theology was in 
the most intimate relation to philosophy; rationalistic as well as spec- 
ulative philosophy make that plainly obvious. A peculiar position is 
~ occupied by Schleiermacher. He was himself a philosophic thinker, yet 
endeavored to sever religion from a combination with philosophy such 
as was found both in orthodox and in rationalistic theology. He did 
this by taking religion to be more a function of the emotions than of 
the intellect. Since the second third of the century passed two new - 
currents, though opposing one another, seem to press philosophic the- 
ology into the background; first, the so-called positive current that 
depends upon church authority. Inthe Protestant Church this current 
is represented by Hengstenberg, in Berlin; in the Catholic, it is identical 
with the great movement of church restoration that led to the Vati- 
canum and now aims everywhere at strict adherence to authoritative 
harmony in theological and philosophical sciences. The second cur- 
rent is that of historic criticism, represented by Baur and the school of 
Tiibingen within, and by D. Fr. Strauss outside of, the universities. 
A similar plan might perhaps be observed in tracing the develop- 
ment of the faculty of law. At the beginning of the epoch under consid- 
sideration we had here also a preponderating influence of, first, Wolff’s, 
then Kant’s and Hege?’s philosophy, which influence was obvious in the
-P-A-G-E-301
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 273 
  interpretation of the ancient natural law, and in the new philosophic 
construction of rights and state. Then the philosophical treatment of 
Jaw was displaced, on the one hand, by the historical school (by Savigny, _ 
in Berlin); on the other, by the school of positivists (by Stahl, in Berlin). 
Lately a renewed tendency toward philosophic contemplation in both 
theology and law seems to manifest itself. In the school of A. Rietschla 
leaning toward Kant’s philosophy, and, strange to say, also toward 
Schleiermacher and his double position, are undeniable. Political 
science shows recently that it is influenced by economic-social ideas of 
history, and a-historic-philosophic, or sociological view, becomes prom- 
inent (Ihering and L. Stein). 
The medical faculty also was at the beginning of this epoch under 
the dominating influence of natural-philosophic theories. Since the 
thirties this course is abandoned, and the tendency is now toward 
strictly scientific investigation of nature. During the present genera- 
tion the medical faculty has experienced an astonishing development. 
Up to the close of the eighteenth century this faculty was, as far as 
numbers are concerned, an insignificant appendix of the theological and 
law faculties. At present the number of students and professors of 
medicine occupies the front rank in not a few universities. Also medi- 
cal institutes of all kinds have been increased and extended; they claim 
a large share of the expenditures of a university. This increase is 
doubtless owing to the rapidly-increasing wealth of the population, but 
the wonderful progress medical science has made is not without 
influence upon the growth alluded to. Improved methods of investi- 
gation, especially the application of the microscope, have caused a 
remarkable progress in recognizing causes and character of diseases, 
followed by important improvements in medical science, especially in 
surgery and the treatment of wounds. 
As far as the outer form of the universities is concerned the ground 
plan has not been materially altered. The articulation into faculties 
has been retained, though at the beginning of this century all sorts of 
objections were uttered against this “institution of the Middle Ages.” 
However, in a few universities the number of faculties has been increased 
by opening a new one for the other confession, or by dividing off from 
the philosophical a faculty for natural sciences and one for political 
science. The last traces of the ancient regulations of life and conduct 
have been lost. There are no “convicts” or dormitories, no professors 
who maintain boarding establishments, no obligatory courses of study, 
no tutors, and even the academic jurisdiction has vanished with the 
exception of a small remnant. The student now is a citizen of the 
state like allothers. After he is enrolled, and has promised to the rector 
with word and hand-shake that he will obey the academic laws, no official 
person asks after him for a number of years. He is left entirely to his 
own counsel. It is evident that this dissolution of all school order is 
essentially a result of the gradual increase of the student’s average age. 
ED 92. 18  
-P-A-G-E-302
274° - EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  The twentieth year is now generally accepted as the average age of the 
freshman; and for young men of 20 to 25 years the strict regulations 
of a school are obviously out of place. 
With regard to the constitution of the teaching bodies, a change 
in the position of the philosophic faculty has taken place. While for- 
merly its object was the general scientific preparation for professional 
study in the three higher faculties, now it has become a professional 
faculty itself, namely, for the preparation of teachers for secondary 
schools. Up to the present century the profession of teaching was an 
adjunct to the theological profession, so that theological candidates 
first spent some time in the service of education, either by accepting a 
position in a city high school or as tutor, before a position in the gift 
of the church was obtainable. At present the teachers’ profession is 
an independent calling; a transition from that into the profession of the 
clergy has occurred rarely since the middle of the century. The intro- 
duction of a professional examination for teachers in 1810 (examen pro 
facultate docendi) designates for Prussia the outspoken separation of 
the two professions which had hitherto been united; its intention was 
the elevation, if not the creation, of a profession of high-school teachers 
with uniform scientific preparation and professional spirit. The inner 
cause of this fact is the separation of the spirit of the time from theol- 
ogy and theologic views, and a tendency to following the humanism of. 
Goethe and Wolf. 
In the matter and form of instruction the changes for.which the 
way had been paved in the preceding epoch have been completed, to wit: 
The German university professor does not consider it his duty to trans- 
mit a fixed inventory of generally accepted truths, but the results of 
individual investigation and research. It is true the term tradere has 
been perpetuated in our programme of lectures, but even the youngest 
Privat-Docent, and he perhaps most of all, would consider it an insult 
to his dignity if he were expected to take the word literally. This is 
quite in accord with the intention underlying instruction; itsis intended 
to lead the student to independent thought and investigation. The 
act of learning expected of the student does not consist in accepting 
finished and polished facts, but in making him think and work scien- 
tifically. 
This, above all, is true with regard to the philosophic faculty. Here 
investigation and suggestions for research are the predominating pur- 
pose. In the other faculties transmission and memorizing of knowl- 
edge necessary for a technical outfit in the profession play a more 
important role. Physicians, judges, and clergymen are not, and do not 
intend to be, learned scholars; at least, this is not their most important 
object. The practical profession and its promotion are already empha- 
sized in the universities. On the other hand, the philosophic faculty 
is really the learned faculty. This is true with regard to the professors 
as well as the students. Externally, the case becomes obvious in its
-P-A-G-E-303
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. ‘215 
relation to the academies of sciences. Between the German academies 
and the philosophic faculties there exists a personal union in the 
widest acceptation of the term, while the other faculties are repre- 
sented only occasionally. Another point makes obvious the impor- 
tance alluded to: The nurseries of investigation, the “ seminaries,” have 
their origin in the philosophic faculty; dissertations emanate from 
them. The importance of the different degrees, also, is characteristic. 
Degrees are given in other faculties as well, but in the theological and 
law faculty seldom, and the medical degree is, although acquired uni- 
formly, of a different character. The acquisition of a degree in the 
medical faculty is the result of social compulsion, but no one believes 
any more than the young M. D. does that he has proven himself 
a learned investigator by having written a dissertation. But, toa cer- 
tain extent, that is the meaning of the degree of Doctor Philosophic. 
The character of instruction in the philosophic faculty is in accord 
with this: it aims throughout at the cultivation of learned scholars. 
A professor of philology, history, mathematics, and physics proceeds 
as though he had before him in his lectures and exercises nothing but 
future learned scholars, future professors. He overlooks, on principle, 
the fact that in reality the great majority of his hearers are intended 
for a practical profession—the profession of teaching; or, rather, he 
does not overlook it, but is convinced that the teacher can not bring 
anything better into his profession than true erudition. Everything 
points toward it. The ancient view of the object of the gymnasium, 
even the traditional name of the institution, “preparatory school for 
the learned,” points toward it. What did a teacher in the preparatory 
school for the learned (the term gymnasium arose at the beginning of 
this century) need in the way of professional preparation more than 
erudition? And, on the other hand, the recently begun and gradually 
extending specialization in the branches taught in the gymnasium 
seems to necessitate such a state of affairs. At present every gymna- 
sium has its professor of ancient and modern philology, its mathema- 
tician and professor of natural science, its historian and theologian. 
This secondary school assumes the aspect of a university in embryo. 
Finally, the character of the examination for the degree, which requires 
only erudition, may be regarded as proof of the assertion. The prob- 
lems submitted to the candidates aré themes for scientific investigation 
and essays. Not unfrequently published essays originate in these 
examinations. Thus, the German teachers in a gymnasium are imbued 
with the spirit of learned men, at least for a time; that is, so long as 
the university sentiments are still strong in them, and the best of them 
even retain some of this spirit all through life. 
Doubtless this condition has its disadvantages; they appear first in 
the fact that many teachers who have devoted: themselves in univer- 
sities to learned studies are somewhat disappointed when they enter 
school, as though they had lost their proper place in the world. The
-P-A-G-E-304

  lowest grade of a gymnasium does not show many opportunities for dis- 
playing profound learning; nor, for that matter, does the highest grade 
of the school. The disadvantages also are seen in this fact, that 
teachers without having had a pedagogical preparation, and being 
suddenly placed in charge of a class, require considerable time before 
they can find their level and a suitable mode of intercourse with their 
pupils. (This has recently been obviated by the institution of semi- 
naries for secondary teachers). On the other hand, it must not be for- 
gotten that the old view, which saw a learned scholar in the teacher of 
a gymnasium, has had great advantages. Upon it rests the high 
estimate enjoyed by the profession of secondary teacher in Germany 
compared with that in other countries. This will not change in future. 
In the hierarchy of the state officers the teachers will never stand at 
the head; the only way in which they can maintain their position is 
by scientific exertions. This determines the character of our gymna- 
sium—it still has something of the school for the learned, that directs 
the attention of the student toward scientific labor and research. If the 
faculty of such a school has only one really learned man, he will give 
the school its character. Thus we see cause and effect. The character 
of the secondary school requires learned men from the philosophic 
faculty and the entire university. They cultivate learned men because 
the teachers of gymnasia lay just claims to being learned men. 
Doubtless the great abundance of scientifically prepared workers in 
all dominions of human exertion, of whom Germany is so justly proud, 
is partly owing to this. The surplus may at times be felt uncomforta- 
bly, but let us not forget that the remarkable working power of the 
German nation in all fields of scientific investigation, especially in phi- 
lJologic and historic research, is owing to this apparent surplus. 
A Frenchman has recently expressed an opinion upon this point, the 
like of which a German would scarcely dare to express, or even enter- 
tain. Ferd. Lot says in his interesting little study (L’enseignement supé- 
rieur en France, 1892): ; 
The scientific predominance (hégémonie) of Germany in all domains of thought, 
without exception, is at present acknowledged by all nations. It-is a confirmed fact 
that Germany alone produces more than all other parts of the world together; its 
superiority in science is similar to that of England in the commerce on the ocean. 
Perhaps it is even greater in comparison. 
It is probable that this is to be taken with some allowance. But M. 
Lot is not mistaken when he says that the organization of the German 
universities, their uniform constitution as corporations, their liberty in 
teaching and learning, and above all, the tendency of their instruction 
toward investigation, are the chief causes of their superiority. This is 
particularly true with regard to the philosophic faculties. In them the 
peculiar character of the German universities, as nurseries of scientific 
investigation and research, is prominently apparent; they draw the 
other faculties into the same channels. Hence whatever would threaten 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. ‘ 277 
  to rob the philosophic faculties of this character would endanger the 
German universities, and the position of Germany in the scientific world. 
Finally, let us not forget, that all this exists and acts in intimate 
connection with historic life. The vital air of the German universities 
is the historic spirit which surrounds them all, and each one in its indi- 
vidual form. There is scarcely one of them which has not in the life 
of our nation, or in some science, at one time, played an important 
role; not one that may not be proud of a few distinguished names of 
abiding importance in the history of science. He who sets foot on this 
ground feels the breath of historic life. And he who enters the lists 
becomes conscious that he accepts certain obligations. Not all feel it 
in the same degree, yet it may be said that in some way everyone feels 
it who enters a university as a teacher, and in some way almost every- 
one feels it who enters as a student. And every graduate takes some 
of that spirit with him into his practical profession. For the German 
clergyman, physician or judge does not wish to be merely a practitioner, 
but also a little of a learned man, at least in so far as is necessary to 
keep his interest awake for what is produced and accomplished in his 
profession by others. This is particularly true (I repeat it emphati- 
cally) of the German high-school teacher; he feels himself not only as 
an officer and teacher, but also as a scholar, and not a small portion of 
them succeed, though often under very restrictive and oppressive 
circumstances, in taking active part in scientific investigation in their 
professional dominion. 
That is what heretofore has given the German gymnasium its char- 
acter; its prideehas ever been to be a school for the learned, and to 
become, in its own manner and in a small compass, something similar 
to what a university is, not only a school for lessons and recitations, 
but an institution wheres scientific work is performed, and where the 
students learn to work scientifically. 
It is to be hoped that the tendencies which aim at an ever increas- 
ing extension of the system of examination and supervision, and which 
would convert the teachers into mere officers and the schools into knowl- 
edge shops, will not succeed in finding general favor. If our gymnasi 
should lose their character of schools for the learned, the universities 
would not be able to maintain their position in future. 
IL.   
THE GERMAN UNIVERSITIES IN THEIR RELATION TO STATE,_ 
CHURCH, AND SOCIETY. 
Their relation to the State.—That the universities should be state 
institutions, seems to us quite self-evident; but it was not always so, 
and it is not necessarily so. Scientific investigation and scientific 
instruction are not, in the nature of the case, a state enterprise. The 
first universities were private corporations, which, under the general 
protection of the state, conduct scientific investigation and instrue- 
tion. Like other guilds, they governed themselves; they made their
-P-A-G-E-306
  278 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
own laws, elected their own officers, had jurisdiction over their own 
members, and perpetuated themselves by admitting new masters of arts, 
in which act, it is true, a formal codperation with the church took place. 
The English universities live in this way to the present day. 
In Germany the state university has developed from historic necessity. 
In the beginning, as has been said before, the German universities were 
founded by heads or princes of the separate states. Since the fifteenth 
century the princely power has become predominant, and has made itself 
felt in the universities, by regulations for reform and ordination; though 
the corporations claimed the right to make their own laws, the princes 
enforced their own rules without much ceremony. 
The Reformation gave to the Protestant princes church power in 
addition to their political power. The universities became institutions 
belonging tothe princely rulers, and had the clearly defined purpose 
of educating officers for state and church service. Since the middle 
of the seventeenth century the state has gradually turned into a 
commonwealth that embraces all and attends to everything. The 
diminutive size of the German states favored the idea of a state that 
represented a single large household under absolute princely adminis- 
tration. During the eighteenth century this view ruled exclusively. 
The acknowledged principle was, the satisfaction of all essential needs 
of life in the community is a matter of state concern, to be attended 
to by state enterprise, or at least under state supervision. The Gov- 
ernment attended to the growth of intercourse and commerce, to the 
opening of roads and canals, to cleaning and lighting of streets, to 
earing for the poor, to the promotion of industries, to the regulation 
of prices for labor and food, to the supply of proper intellectual food 
by means of books, theaters, etc. Naturally it belonged to the duties 
of the state to furnish the young with the necessary instruction. The 
German elementary school (Volksschule), which makes both the offer 
and the acceptation of a general elementary education a duty of citi- 
zenship, is the fruit of the eighteenth century. Naturally the universi- 
ties were also drawn into the folds of this general parental Government. 
The Prussian civil code only formulated an existing and self-evident 
law when it said at the head of the chapter “Public Education”: 
Schools and universities are state institutions, intended to offer instruction of 
the young in useful knowledge and science. 
The nineteenth century, it is true, has not preserved the principle of 
state omnipotence in its original form; the various constitutions, since 
1848, express in general terms a number of limitations to the state’s 
activity. Thus the Prussian constitution says in section 20, “ Knowledge 
andthe teaching of knowledgeare free,” and adds in section 22, that it is 
left free to every one to give instruction and establish educational 
institutions; butas a necessary requirement is mentioned, that he first - 
prove to the Government his moral, intellectual, and technical ability, 
and submit to governmental supervision. In fact only the nineteenth
-P-A-G-E-307
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. : 279 
century has thoroughly carried out the plan of turning the educational 
system into a state institution. Foremost of all, the “schools for the 
preparation of thelearned” (the gymnasia), which during thelast century 
were almost exclusively city institutions, came under direct state 
management. Later on, by creating a department of public instruction 
and the requisite machinery of management, the entire system of publice 
education found a proper representation in the hierarchy of state 
officials. 
In sketching the present legal status of the German universities, we 
may say: 
The universities are institutions founded and maintained by the 
state. Codperation with papal or imperial power, in vogue formerly, 
has ceased to be. Also the power of granting degrees emanates from 
the state. The state grants charters and prescribes statutes. It estab- 
lishes chairs and institutes and endows them. The professors and 
directors of institutes (libraries, laboratories, hospitals, clinics, ete.) 
are state officers. The universities are under direct supervision of the 
minister of education, not subject to provincial governments. In a 
number of universities a local representative of the minister, in the 
person of the curator, sometimes called chancellor, is found; his chief 
duties consist in a general supervision of the institution and care for 
the promotion of its ability in every department, especially with refer- 
ence to pecuniary matters. All communications between the Depart- 
ment of Public Instruction and the university go through his hands. 
If thus the university has been made legally a link of the entire 
state system of education, it occupies nevertheless, a peculiar position, 
and, as it were, one of exemption. It enjoysa measure of independence 
and self-dependence like no other state institution; state supervision 
of the professors is almost imperceptible. Also essential parts of the 
ancient codperative self-government have remained, chief of which is 
the free election of academic officers. The head of the university is the 
rector. He is elected annually by the college of regular professors. 
He formally represents the university, the other officers are subject 
to his orders; he matriculates students, and exercises supervision 
over the associations and meetings of the students. The senate, 
also, is elected by the professors. Beside the members elected, it 
consists of the rector as chairman, the academic judge, and the sey- 
eral deans. The senate forms a board of general management. The 
application of disciplinary jurisdiction over the students is the joint 
duty of the rector, the judge of the university, and the senate. In 
Prussia the following punishments for misdemeanors of the students 
are at the disposal of the rector: Reprimand, fine not to exceed $5, 
imprisonment, not to exceed fourteen days, suspension from the uni- 
Sersity: threatened, actual relegation, and lastly, expulsion. 
~“1If a student is s relegated from a German university he may attend ‘another, but 
if he is expelled from one, he is thereby debarred from attending all other German 
universities. (THE TRANSLATOR.)
-P-A-G-E-308
  280 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Like the university, so the faculties posess an important function of 
self-government. They eachannually elect a dean from their midst, who 
conducts the business of the faculty. As a board the faculty super- 
vises that which is taught, and it is their special duty to see to it that- 
every branch of study is represented in the course or calendar of the 
term. Furthermore, they exercise supervision over the students in 
regard to their morals and scientific attainments, which supervision, 
however, in the usual course of events, is noticed no more than the 
supervision of the professors on the part of the state. They also 
manage the benefices and stipends, and conduct the examinations 
prescribed to secure them; they determine the prize questions and 
award the prizes. Last but not least, they conduct the examinations 
for academic degrees, and through their deans grant the degrees. 
They give to Privat Docenten the “venia legendi,” and submit to the 
minister of education the names of suitable candidates for vacant 
chairs; this defines their old right of nomination. 
In regard to the management of the course of study in the university, 
it may be said, that almost absolute liberty rules supreme. All 
the supervision there is confines itself in reality to the two points, 
that every appointed professor give lectures, and that the required 
branches are represented each by a course of lectures and exercises. 
On the other hand, no official courses of study are prescribed, as is 
done in schools, where contents, extent, and form of the matter are out- 
lined. The professor is simply commissioned to teach a certain branch; 
it is left to him to interpret that commission: to determine the separate 
parts of his branch, the number of hours he may devote to them, the 
matter he may treat, the method he may employ—all this is left to his 
own discretion, No one speaks of reports, revision, or control by means 
of supervisory officers. 
It is reasonable to say that at no time heretofore has university 
instruction enjoyed a greater measure of liberty than now. Up to the 
seventeenth century instruction was limited by the requirement that it 
should, in regard to the matter taught, be in accord with the doctrines 
of the church with which it was affiliated; also official prescriptions 
regarding the matter and form of instruction were rather peremptory. 
During the eighteenth century the Government not infrequently 
meddled with the internal affairs of the instruction; it often happened 
that the professors (particular ones, especially) were ordered to use 
certain sources of information, and to follow certain methods. Even 
during the first half of the nineteenth century similar orders were 
given; for instance, during the twenties and forties against Hegel’s 
philosophy. At present all attempts to influence the internal manage- 
ment of the university have ceased; matter and method of instruction 
are left entirely to the discretion of the professor. While in the 
“schools for the learned” (the gymnasia) liberty of teaching has been 
more and more offensively restricted, in the university this liberty has 
been more and more extended, and is now admitted without reserve.  
-P-A-G-E-309
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 281 
Postponing a discussion of this liberty for the present, a word may 
be inserted concerning the mode of appointment of professors. As 
was said before, the extraordinary professors are appointed by the 
minister of education, while the regular professors are appointed by 
the King himself. However, in filling the chair of a regular professor, 
there is a codperation on the part of the faculty. The latter is called 
upon to send in nominations, accompanied by an opinion upon the work 
and reputation of the persons nominated. As a rule three names are 
proposed, but the Government is neither legally nor actually bound to 
accept these. This mode of procedure has been severely criticised; it 
has been said that it opened the way to intrigues, to school and family 
nepotism. TheGerman universities are accustomed to meet thisreproach 
with the calmness of a good conscience, and they may safely do so. 
Now and then a thing is done which had better have been left undone, 
but where in all this world are there coveted positions connected with 
which no irregularity ever takes place? Take it all in all, our univer- 
sities have fared well under the present mode, and it would be difficult 
to find a system of filling university chairs which would better and more 
securely serve the purpose—i. e., to put the right man into the right 
place. The privilege of the faculty to propose candidates curbs the 
absolute will of the minister, which in reality means the rule of one 
man, the head of a school; for the minister, or a bureau chief in the 
department, could not possibly have an independent judgment of all 
branches of study, hence would ask privately the advice of a compe- 
tent person. As it is now, he hears also‘the voices of others—i. e., of 
competent and responsible advisers. 
. On the other hand, it is necessary that the appointments should be 
made by the Government. The central state authority alone is able to 
view the entire field with its needs and available forces, and to weigh 
in the balance personal circumstances and local conditions. An elec- 
tion by the faculty alone would doubtless be disastrous, since it would 
open the door to the rule of schools and coteries, to personal interests 
and intrigues. In this light the procedure customary in Germany 
appears to be the securest and least dangerous; for to apply the mode 
in vogue in Romanic countries—i. e., to open such vacancies to competi- 
tion with its applications, accompanied by copies of writings or the 
requests for trial lectures—this, at least with us, will not prove a 
means to secure proficient men, but deter the most talented from com- 
petition. 
It would not seem inexpedient, though, to adopt the often made 
proposition to endow the various chairs with fixed and gradually increas- 
ing salaries according to length of service, partly in order to do away 
with the negotiations concerning the salary that now take place when 
a chair is to be filled, partly also to make the increase in salary less 
dependent upon the accident of appointments. The frequent changes 
taking place in the personnel of a university, caused by the existing cir- 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
282 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. ~ 
  cumstances, results in more evil than good; above all, the small 
universities suffer thereby. If a regular increase in salary were in 
vogue, as it is in Bavaria at present, one inducement for aiming at 
' positions in the large universities would lose its force. 
Relation of the universities to the church.—Originally this relation 
was so intimate that the universities of the Middle Ages, and in a cer- 
tain sense also those of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, could 
be called ecclesiastical institutions. Since the eighteenth century this 
connection has been loosened, and during the nineteenth century, as 
stated before, the German universities, like the German states, have 
thrown off their ecclesiastical and denominational character. 
The Protestant church has accommodated itself to this change; it 
has not even objected to its clergymen being professionally prepared 
in a state institution in which it has no influence. However, the 
ehurch, being intimately connected with the state, could simply and 
confidently expect that the state, which it completely permeated, would 
assume a duty that by rights should belong to the church. In fact, 
the church has always exercised a far-reaching influence upon the 
entire system of education, from the primary school to the university. 
But since the state has become undenominational, and the state’s 
policy is now determined to a great extent by the varying majorities in 
the legislatures, the Protestant church is beginning to see the inse- 
curity of its position and efforts are being made to allow the church 
officials a decisive codperation in filling theological chairs in the uni- 
versity; a proposition to that effect has been submitted to the supreme 
consistory. The prospect of success in these efforts are at present not 
promising. If the church should succeed in this, it is very doubtful 
that it will gain by it. If the appointment of chairs of theology becomes 
dependent to a great extent upon the ecclesiastical authorities, the 
faculty could not maintain their present position in the universities. 
Both professors and students would then stand only with one foot on 
university ground—that is, on the ground of free science. That, how- 
ever, is a condition which would be prejudicial to Protestant theology. 
It can flourish only in intimate reciprocal relation with free philosophy 
and science. It is not backed, like the Catholic theology, by the 
authority of an infallible church; it rests wholly upon the live personal 
power of its representatives. Neither could the Protestant church 
endure it; a narrow-minded party rule within the church, which would 
be the inevitable consequence, would speedily wreck it. 5 
Quite a different relation exists between the university and the 
Catholic Church, not only in Protestant, but also in Catholic states. 
The Roman Catholic Church is a great independently organized power, 
older than all the modern states. It claims the right to regulate the 
preparation of its own servants, and actually has succeeded everywhere 
in making good this claim. The majority of the Catholic clergy receives 
its preparation in institutions managed directly by the bishops, in boys’,
-P-A-G-E-311
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 283 
  clerical, and priests’ seminaries. Attempts made in Prussia, in the sey- 
enties, to bring the preparation of Catholic clergymen under the 
influence of the state have been abandoned. A limited measure of 
supervision on the part of the state over the Episcopal institutions is, 
however, still in force. The course of study of clerical seminaries must 
be submitted to the minister of education, who is empowered to declare 
the instruction offered in Episcopal seminaries equivalent to that of a 
university course. This is necessary, because the state would not pay 
a Catholic clergyman his salary, unless he could prove his adequate 
preparation for the office. The Catholic faculties in the universities 
are, in fact, also dependent upon church government. Before a pro- 
fessor is appointed, the state seeks an agreement with the church 
authorities, and, after he is appointed, a simple order from the bishops 
not to attend his lectures has always proved a sufficiently effective 
means to nullify his usefulness. 
During recent years efforts are being made by Catholics to call into 
existence denominational universities aside from the state universities. 
In Belgium, France, and Italy there are already a small number of these 
«facultés libres.” It is the intention to establish a similar institution 
for German Catholics, and the city of Salzburg is thought of as a suita- 
ble locality. But, as yet, the execution of this plan seems to lie in the 
dim distance. : 
Relation of the University to Society.—This may be viewed from three 
sides: (1) The aim of the university in society; (2) the position 
which the representatives of academic culture hold in society; (3) the 
strata of society from which they come. 
(1) The university, like all educational institutions, owes its origin to 
social needs. Upon a higher plane of culture the necessity for profes- 
sional work is developed; that is, work which presupposes a high degree 
of scientific knowledge. 
There are three services which, according to ancient custom, require 
a really scientific preparation: The ecclesiastical government (cura-et 
regimen animarum); the secular government (legislative, executive, 
and judiciary); and the medical profession. For these three profes- 
sions the three so-called higher faculties act as special schools—the 
theological for the clerical, the law faculty for the secular offices, and 
the medical for the physicians. The philosophic faculty was originally 
not a professional school, but an institution for general culture (arts and 
sciences). Only in the nineteerith century has it become a professional 
faculty also, namely, for teachers of secondary schools. 
During recent years several new learned professions have arisen 
that require a really scientific preparation. The professional work of 
technologists, engineers, architects, chemists (as scientific heads of * 
chemical manufactories), miners, and foresters, and similarly the work 
of agriculturists and army officers have so many scientific aspects that 
a scientific, professional preparation has become indispensable for them.
-P-A-G-E-312
  284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  This new social need has occasioned new forms of higher education, 
which only need to be mentioned here, but must be mentioned in order 
to comprehend the ever-widening definition of the terms higher educa- 
tion or academic culture. First of all are to be mentioned the tech- 
nical universities, or polytechnica, of which Germany has nine at pres- 
ent, all established during the nineteenth century. Secondly, mining 
and forestry academies, veterinary and agricultural schools, the latter 
mostly connected with universities. Finally, we may class among the 
institutions for professional work both the fine art and the military 
academies, which nowadays have a scientific basis. Many of these 
institutions imitate the universities in their constitution, courses, and 
regulations for students. This is especially true of the polytechnica. 
An aim which all universities have in common is the theoretic, 
scientific preparation for the future profession. The practical admis- 
sion to the profession, as a rule, follows the scientific preparation. But 
there are differences to be observed. The physician enters upon his 
practice as soon as he graduates from his medical course; his education 
is considered practically completed. The jurist, however, is obliged to 
spend a number of years in practical preparation after graduating, 
while the army officer requires this preparation before he enters upon 
a higher course of education. 
Like their origin, so is the maintenance of universities dependent 
upon social needs, in which they have their fertile soil. The changing 
preponderance of the faculties, for instance, points toward changes 
taking place in the social conditions and views of the people. During 
the sixteenth century, when church affairs dominated all public inter- 
ests, the theological faculty was most prominent in reputation and at- 
tendance. The development of the modern state during the seventeenth 
century enhanced the importance of the faculty of jurisprudence. The 
rise and independence of the philosophic faculty at the close of the 
eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries is an indica- 
tion of the great change in the ruling thought of the time, that may be 
characterized as a turning away from the supernatural and ecclesiasti- 
eal to a rationalistic, secular view of the world. The church loses its 
hold in school and education; the disciples of modern humanism dis- 
place the church in the secondary schools, and the disciples of Pesta- 
lozzi enter the lower schools. The rise of the medical faculty during 
the nineteenth century, its phenomenal increase in attendance, is evi- 
dently a consequence of the increased wealth of the population, which 
causes an increase in the demand for medical advice and aid. But we 
see in it also a change of mind. The cure of the body has become so im- 
portant a matter that people do not treat themselves any longer, but 
depend upon the advice of experts. In former times people relied upon 
traditional knowledge, handed down from one generation to another, 
while in questions of the soul they always depended upon expert 
guidance.
-P-A-G-E-313

  (2) With regard to the position in society of the representatives of 
academic culture, it may be said that in their totality they form an 
essentially homogeneous social stratum to which all leading and ruling 
men belong. To this stratum belong the clergymen, the officers in the 
higher positions of the Government, the teachers of secondary schools, 
the physicians, the higher technologists and architects, artists, and as 
a special group, the military officers. All take part in the government 
and administration. We find them in administrative offices and courts, 
in consistories and in the government of schools, in bureaus of con- 
struction, and in the administration of hygiene. 
All who belong to this stratum associate with each other upon a 
level of social equality which, however, does not exclude differences in 
rank and birth. But he who has a university education belongs to 
society; he is entitled to connubiwm and commercium. On the other 
hand, he who has no university education, or an academic culture 
equal to it, is considered below par in the eyes of many people in Ger- 
many. He must at least have gone through a gymnasium, and with 
his graduation certificate have acquired the potential right to academic 
citizenship, in order to claim social consideration. The consequence 
of this is, of course, that aristocracy and plutocracy seek the univer- 
sity, or, at least, graduate from the “school for the preparation of the 
learned,” the gymnasium. The entire gentility of Germany feels com- 
pelled at present to do either one or both. 
This is not the case everywhere, and it has not always been the case 
in Germany. During the Middle Ages higher education was not at all 
a condition of admission to the ruling class of society. In the ancient 
university, gentility was sparsely represented. Higher studies were 
necessary only for officers in the church, and even that requirement 
could be replaced by aristocratic birth. Princes and rulers who were 
vanting in the simplest elements of a school education were in the 
majority during the first half of the Middle Ages, and during the sec- 
ond half not found unfrequently. A change began toward the end of 
the Middle Ages. Reading and writing became more necessary, at first 
in the cities, and therefore these arts were acquired more frequently. 
In the sixteenth century they became indispensable to every one who 
occupied an important position in society, and more extended scientific 
education gradually became necessary for gentility. As early as the 
fifteenth century we find everywhere, at the courts of princes, learned 
men as councilors in important positions, men who were acquainted 
with the laws. The aristocracy was thereby obliged to resort to higher 
studies in order to preserve its position as the ruling class. In the 
sixteenth century, the state schools, and likewise the colleges of the 
Jesuits, swarmed with aristocratic students, many of whom entered the 
university. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was 
more and more considered conformable to aristocratic rank and station 
to spend at least a few years in a university “for the purpose of study.” ’

gen, displayed with pride the names of hundreds of barons, counts, and 
even princes, who had been matriculated in these institutions. It is 
true there was another way to distinction—the military career that led 
through the military academy and the page service. The great princes 
were at that time standing too high to commingle with the people by 
attending a university; imperial and royal princes were sought in vain 
in gymnasia or universities during the sixteenth century. 
On the other hand, that century did not make university education a 
condition of admission to society. Only the study of law gave entrance 
to society. Candidates for positions in school and church as such oecu- 
pied a very inferior position. A candidate of theology who accepted a 
position as tutor in an aristocratic house was considered as belonging 
to the servants, and when he became rector of asmall city Latin school, 
he counted as parts of his official income the fees he could collect for 
singing at funerals, and his new-year presents. Not until he had 
become pastor did he gain a more elevated position; but even as pastor 
it did not occur to him to consider himself socially equal to the lord of 
the manor. 
It was in the nineteenth century that university education rose in 
prominence to such an extent that its possessors could lay claims to 
social equality* with classes that had enjoyed inherited privileges. 
This was the result of the great political and social change that 
deprived aristocracy of the rank of the ruling class, which it had 
gained during the seventeenth century. Aristocracy is not any longer 
the privileged gentility that has an inherited claim to all state offices 
so far as they are desirable. Like all other classes, aristocracy is now 
_ obliged to pass through schools and examinations, and to stand in line 
with other applicants. Hence we find in gymnasia at present the sons 
of the most aristocratic families, even the princes of ruling dynasties 
are found there; they sit on the same benches with sons of simple citi- 
zens and meet them on the benches of the university. And again they 
sit side by side in Governmental bureaus, as high up as the King’s 
cabinet. Frequently they meet as comrades in the corps of officers in 
the army; even the school teacher is officer of the reserve army, and 
may become privy-councilor of the realm. Thus education has won 
the victory over the aristocracy of birth, and the ancient idea of 
“misalliance” has died out. 
With this change is intimately connected a disadvantage that 
oppresses all the learned professions of the day. Their official income 
is not sufficient to defray the necessary expenses of life and to main- 
tain a high social position; at least this is true with regard to married 
men. This disadvantage is felt everywhere, but mostly in the teaching 
profession, the members of which chiefly come from strata of society 
which are not favored with wealth. The lawyers and medical men 
usually come from wealthier strata; besides, their professional work

enables them to secure a better income, in some cases to accumulate a 
fortune. The theologians are better protected in their profession, 
partly by good salaries, partly also by the fact that they live in rural 
communities, where luxury is seldom displayed or even known. It 
can not be denied that this disproportion is a source of discomfort and 
discontent which it is difficult to remedy. 
(3) As to the third question, whence come the men of academic cul- 
ture, it may be said they come from all classes of society. In prepara- 
tory schools and universities we find side by side with the sons of 
aristocracy and plutocracy the sons of farmers and tradesmen, village 
schoolmasters and subaltern officers. Here all academic citizens con- 
sider themselves equal on principle; occasional pretensions of aristo- 
eratic and plutocratic coteries usually end in their exclusion from the 
festive gatherings of the students. The principle is accepted that 
everyone who has been admitted to the right of academic citizenship 
has thereby acquired the claim to equality, which, if it should beeome 
necessary, he may defend with armed hand; no one can deny him sat- 
isfaction upon the ground of his descent. 
Hence we may speak of a democratic character as marking the Ger- 
man university. It excludes no one on the ground of his descent, and 
makes all its members equals. E.M. Arndt expressed this beautifully 
in his periodical, The Watchman (1815), when he said: + 
As a citizen of a university, the son of the poorest and most obscure parents, 
“armed and mounted” by culture, enters the arena together with the noblest and 
most distinguished, and he who proved to be the best in mind, aspiration, and cour- 
age can, if he is so inclined, rule by his talents. This proud equality, which life 
with its numerous limitations afterward rarely ever shows, I consider the greatest 
glory of the German students, the most precious relic that has remained of what the 
great German nation once was. 
Itis different with our Western neighbors, where admission to aca- 
demic culture is limited to smaller social circles. In the old English 
universities the expenses are so high that they can be met only by 
wealthy people. Board and lodging in the college alone, for the six 
months of three terms, costs about 3,000 marks a year or more. To that 
mnust be added that the state does not maintain preparatory schools. In 
place of our gymnasia, which make higher study possible for sons of the 
poorer people by exempting them from tuition fees, in England the 
ancient public schools and some private institutions are all boarding 
schools; they prepare for the universities and are very costly institu- 
tions. By similar conditions in the lycées in France, which are always 
boarding schools, the poorer people are prevented from pursuing higher 
studies, though the church in France opens its educational institutions 
to them. 
However, it can not be denied that recently, also in Germany, the 
circle from which the students of the learned professions are recruited 
has been narrowed down. The class of artisans and rural day-labor- 
ers is not represented any longer in the university. This is the inevi-  
-P-A-G-E-316
  288 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
table consequence of the fact that academic culture lifted its possessor 
into the ruling classes. 
The case presents itself historically in this way. In the university 
of the Middle Ages all classes of the population were represented; 
aristocracy sparsely—only the younger sons destined to enter the church 
came to study. The middle classes of citizens were in the majority, 
but also sons of peasants and “ poverty” were not wanting; they 
maintained themselves by alms; solventes and pauperes are the two 
classes which we meet on the rolls of the university. During the 
sixteenth century the order of begging monks disappeared and with 
them the beggar students; but in the court schools and other boarding 
schools public provision was made for indigent students by means of 
scholarships and private benefices—private, in so far as the names of 
those who enjoyed them were not published. Naturally the officers of 
church and school had the lion’s share of these benefices. This is the 
reas@w why the theological faculty was considered less aristocratic, 
than the law faculty, where gentility was represented. During that 
century the expenses for university study rose perceptibly; also the 
duration of the course was gradually extended. 
During the last century it was still customary for students to close 
attendance at a Latin school quite early, in order to go to a university, 
there to spendea few semesters with the aid of benefices, or as private in- 
structor; then spend a few years as tutor in an aristocratic family in the 
country, and after that, passa very difficult examination before a consis- 
torial councilor and receive a position as rector of a school or pastor of 
achurch. At present the rule is: Attendance of nine years ina gym- 
nasium and of at least three years in the university, which frequently 
extends to four and five years. To this must be added the expensive 
voluntary one year’s service in the army. This is followed by a long 
period of waiting, owing to enormous competition; the position of tutor 
has become very rare because the aristocratic families send their sons to 
inilitary academies and public schools. Thus it has gradually come to 
pass that a safe income in the learned professions can not be expected 
before the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year of age. : 
Naturally the pauperes of the ancient university have begun to disap- 
pear, and there is a strong current going through society which approves 
of this disappearance. It is said occasionally by lawyers and physi- 
cians, “we do not want the sons of small people,” and the teachers are 
beginning to say the same. One can read in periodicals for secondary 
teachers: 
The profession suffers when young men of the lower classes, sons of tradespeople, 
small farmers, and village schoolmasters, come to the university. They almost 
always bring with them a scanty scientific, and invariably an insufficient social 
culture, which makes it difficult to maintain themselves among the students. 
  Without doubt these objections are not unfounded. Certainly pov- 
erty is a great obstacle to successful study. He who is obliged to earn  
-P-A-G-E-317
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 289 
his daily bread by dint of giving private lessons will not have left much 
time, power, or vigor of mind to occupy himseif with learning. 
If this obstacle is not overcome by exceptional talent and great moral 
strength, study becomes a misfortune. Nowadays cases of this kind 
are not rare. The earnest desire of parents to lift their children to a 
higher position in life, which desire is quite common with numerous 
subaltern officers, has, during the last few decades, contributed consid- 
erably toward overcrowding the universities, partly with elements en- 
tirely unfit. On the other hand, it can not be denied that the exclusion 
of indigent elements, which to all appearances is on the increase, is not 
without danger. Above all, the disintegration of the nation as a body 
would be hastened thereby. If it should come to pass that the broad 
mass of the population, including artisans and small farmers, that now 
rise through intermediate steps, such as the positions in lower schools 
and subaltern offices, should not be represented in the university, then 
these classes would consider the state and its entire administrative 
organization as a foreign domination. In the ranks of social democ- 
racy, which has permeated with its views the industrial population of 
large cities, this feeling is already prevalent; the state appears to them 
an institution of the privileged classes for the purpose of defending 
their interests against the masses. I know of nothing that could more 
effectually spread this idea than the actual exclusion from higher 
studies and the learned professions of all who do not belong to the 
wealthier classes of society. The comprehension on the part of the 
cultured, for the people and their life, would vanish; offensive haugh- 
tiness and foolish sentimentality together would bring about a complete 
estrangement. 
Another thing should be considered: the exclusion referred to would 
deprive the intellectual life of the nation of talents and powers which 
it can not relinqnish without exposing itself to the danger of intellee- 
tualimpoverishment. Itmust not be forgotten that many of our most 
prominezt men have come from very low strata—Winckelmann and 
Heyne, Kant and Fichte, were born in the humble homes of small 
tradesmen. 
Jacob Grimm in his autobiography, looking back upon his own youth 
and the restrictions placed upon him, gives expression to a beautiful 
thought, worthy of being repeated. He set forth the honor and advan- 
tage of poverty admirably, saying: 
  Poverty urges to diligence and labor, preserves us from many a dissipation and 
infuses us with a noble pride, that is, a consciousness of self-earned merit, in com- 
parison with him who is supported by class-pride or wealth. TI should even like to 
generalize, and say, many of the grand things the Germans have done should be 
attributed to the fact that they are nota wealthy nation, They work upward from 
below, and open new and peculiar ways, while other nations march the broad, well- 
paved highway. —

Il.—TEACHERS IN UNIVERSITIES AND UNIVERSITY INSTRUCTION. 
  Professors and Privat-Docenten (or Private Lecturers).—In German ™ 
universities three classes of teachers are active in all the faculties, 
to wit: Regular, extraordinary, and Privat-Docenten. 
Privat-Docenten simply have the permission to give lectures and 
conduct exercises (venia legendi), but no obligations. They are not 
appointed, and have no salary. The extraordinary professor is an 
appointed officer of the state, and as arule receives a salary; but he 
has neither seat nor vote in the faculty, he does not take part in elec- 
tions, meetings, and academic examinations. The regular professor 
is one of the members of the faculty occupying an endowed chair, he 
is appointed by the state, and is the official representative of a scien- 
tific branch. The entire number of the regular professors forms the 
body of the faculty. There is to be mentioned a fourth class of pro- 
fessors found occasionally, the so-called honorary professors. This 
grade is reserved for meritorious aged scholars, who are too old for 
the regular professorship, or do not desire to be a regular member of 
the faculty, yet wish to continue their work as professors. Their legal 
connection with the university is similar to that of the reading mem- 
ber of the academy, and does not essentially differ from that of the 
private professor. The lectors, or teachers of modern languages for 
practical use, who as a rule are foreigners, may be regarded as an 
appendage to the philosophic faculty. Finally, we mention the masters 
of exercises, teachers of fencing, riding, and dancing. 
_ The three chief classes of university teachers mentioned show the 
normal gradation of an academic career. One enters the faculty as a 
Privat-Docent, then after a time which may be long or short, as ecir- 
cumstances decide, the Privat-Docent is appointed to an extraordinary 
professorship, and again, as occasion offers and vacancies occur, he 
becomes a regular member of the faculty. However, exceptions to 
this rule are so frequent, that of late years it has almost ceased to be a 
rule. Not every academic teacher is first a private lecturer; in the 
philosophic faculty especially, appointments take place from outside’ 
the university, frequently from among teachers of gymnasia. Nor 
does every Privat-Docent become in turn, a regular professor. Not a 
few of them leave the university in order to enter a practical profession, 
in ecclesiastic and secular offices, at the head of schools, in a library or 
some other institution; some retain private lecturers all their lives. 
The medical faculty has an unusually large number of Privat-Docenten, 
because their duties do not greatly interfere with the practice of a 
physician. Lastly, the extraordinary professorship is by no means a __ 
necessary stepping stone to the highest grade. A promotion from the 
private to the regular professorship is not at allrare. -Nor is it unus- 
ual to see extraordinary professors remain in their positions, without 
being promoted, especialiy in large universities. There are branches
-P-A-G-E-319
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. : 291 
of study for which there is only one extraordinary professor appointed. 
Despite all these Iimitations, the gradations mentioned may yet be 
_ considered the typical career of a German university professor. x 
Since the private lectureship is a peculiarity of the German univer- 
sity that has attracted the attention of foreigners, a word concerning 
this office and its importance may be of interest. Historically it may be 
looked upon as a survival from the constitution of a corporation, such 
as was the university of the Middle Ages. He who had by the faculty 
been declared Magister, that is, a master of sciences and arts, had 
thereby acquired the privilege of teaching in this faculty, and the right 
frequently became a duty in the faculty ofarts. Since among lecturing 
masters of arts the older ones were provided with professorships in the 
colleges, with prebends or salaries, a distinction gradually arose between 
appointed and paid teachers who were obliged to give public lectures 
without receiving fees for them, and masters who taught for fees with- 
out receiving salary, or being under official obligations. This distine- 
tion was more sharply drawn when, after the Reformation, the systém 
of permanent paid professors was extended to the philosophic faculty. 
With that distinction the obligation to serve as teacher, after obtaining 
the degree of master, was dropped, the perpetuation of the institution 
being secured by permanent professorships. Instead of this obligatory 
gratuitous service, the demand for further scientific accomplishments 
became customary in order to be accepted in any faculty as magister 
legens, we mean the work to be done for the purpose of habilitating as 
Privat-Docent, as it is at present required everywhere. The applicant 
for the venia legendi must nowadays, after having acquired the degree 
of doctor from one of the faculties, submit printed or written theses, 
pass an oral examination before the faculty, and deliver a public trial 
lecture; moreover, his habilitation, as a rule, is not allowed after the 
expiration of three years following his graduation as a student. The 
faculties are under no obligation whatever to admit anyone as a private 
lecturer; merit alone decides that. Generally, it may be said that the 
venia legendi is not granted very readily. 
* The importance of this habilitation is found in the fact that it gives 
admission to the circle of those from whom the college of professors 
is chiefly recruited. The Privat-Docent acquires no right with this 
admission, no legal claim upon a professorship, yet with tolerably 
profound scientific labor he is, exceptions not considered, sure to reach 
the next higher step, the extraordinarium after a few years. 
These years of private lecturing are considered essentially trial years. 
The young man has opportunities to try his hand at teaching and to 
develop his scientific attainments. His work as a teacher, which, in 
regard to the extent of his subject and number of his students, remains 
limited, is of great importance for the future professor. He has oppor- 
tunities to practice the art of academic instruction, a thing that has to 
be learned. The first mistakes, which are sure to be made, are made
-P-A-G-E-320
    292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
before a small number of students, and are easily corrected. If his 
choice of the academic profession should prove an error, it may be rec- 
tified by turning into other directions without great injury or much 
loss of time. 
The consequence of this gradation is that the three classes of pro- 
fessors stand on a level in a certain sense; and this fact is of the 
greatest importance for the form which instruction takes; it produces 
a competition of several professors in the same branch of study, which is 
a characteristic feature of German universities. This competition allows 
the students free selection of teachers. The regular professor is the 
appeinted teacher of his branch, but he is not the only one. Besides him, 
there is, for extensive parts of his branch, it may be philology, history, 
physics, mathematics, or philosophy, and similarly in the other faculties, 
at least one Privat-Docent and one extraordinary professor, often there 
are several, who lecture on the same subjects. As arule, the lectures are 
so arranged that no duplication takes place; but in large universities it 
is not unfrequently observed, that the same subjects occur several times 
in the published courses of lectures, and there is no objection to the 
“student’s preferring the lectures of the Privat-Docent or extraordinary 
_professors; be this because he has personal preference or because it is 
more convenient for him todoso. Naturally, the regular professor has 
the preference, being an older and more widely known scholar; besides, 
he manages the institute or seminary, and is examiner in academic or 
state examinations. Nevertheless the activity of younger teachers is 
not insignificant, especially in large universities. We must also con- 
sider that in them the faculty has elements with which youth likes to 
associate. The young private lecturer enters more readily into intimate 
personal intercourse, especially with older students. 
It has often been said that this competition between older and 
younger teachers contributes toward infusing fresh life into the 
instruction, and prevents humdrum routine work. This is unquestion- 
ably true. The younger man must do his best, in order to succeed 
beside the elder well-reputed professor; on the other hand, the elder 
one is spurred to ever renewed efforts, and prevented from sinking into 
ruts, a danger always connected with life appointments. If he should 
follow the natural tendency of advancing age, shut himself up in his 
thoughts and views, and pass by everything new that may turn up, or 
if he should devote himself entirely to lis profound investigations, 
and perform his duties as teacher perfunctorily, he would soon, by the 
diminished attendance upon his lectures, be reminded of the necessity, 
that in order to attract youth, he must remain fresh himself, and be in - 
sympathy with the movements of the time. The university students are 
not apt to tolerate such a thing as hearing read to them the same old 
papers that are spotted with age. Youth soon feels whether or not dili- 
gence, love,and animated sympathy prompt the professor to continuous 
inner revival. It is also important to consider that the personal rela-
-P-A-G-E-321
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. . 293 
  tion between the student and teacher is based upon the fact that the 
former is not obliged to be present, but that he has chosen the teacher 
himself. Of course, deliberation and careful selection do not always 
decide; accident, habit, and calculation play their role frequently, but 
generally it may be said that the German student is really not under 
obligation to hear a professor whom he does not like. As a rule he 
finds in the same university another representative of the same branch 
of science, and when that is not the case, he goes to another university, 
and there looks for instruction that pleases him better. The personal 
friendly intercourse between teachers and students found everywhere 
in German universities is doubtless the result of this arrangement. 
Hostile treatment oi a professor on the part of the students is some- 
thing unheard of in Germany. Obligatory attendance at lectures 
would undoubtedly lead to discord and hostilities. 
A remark concerning the payment of fees for private lectures may 
be inserted here. This arrangement may at first sight appear illiberal; 
would it not be better to abolish this last vestige of the system of 
paying fees in the Middle Ages, which system has been done away 
with in so many other state institutions? With regard to the relation 
of the scientific teacher to his pupil the custom has an embarrassing 
aspect. It reminds one of the sophists and their treatment of Socrates. 
The payment of a fixed sum into the university treasury, in return for 
which the student would be admitted to all the lectures he may choose 
to attend, or gratuitous attendance upon the entire course, after the stu- 
dent has paid ‘intellectual import duties” by passing his fingl exam- 
ination in the preparatory school, would seem a more worthy and better 
mode. Nevertheless, we find that the university professors are much 
attached to the ancient arrangement, and not without cause. It would 
hardly do to look for the cause in selfish interest, for the present occu- 
pants of the positions would *scarcely be losers if new regulations 
were adopted; on the contrary, on an average it is reasonable to 
suppose that they would receive larger incomes; at any rate, a secu- 
rity against fluctuations would be offered. However reasonable this 
appears, there are very strong objections to such an arrangement. 
(1) Man values and uses to better advantage that for which he pays 
hard cash more than that which is given to him as a present; to this 
general rule the student is no exception. Nor would a general pay- 
ment of tuition fees per half year make any difference. As things are 
now the student acquires a claim upon certain performances by a pay- 
ment dependent upon his own will. The introduction of a general 
advance payment would lead to irregular attendance upon all kinds of 
lectures, and this would have to be met on the part of the managers by 
introducing regulations that would degrade the university to the rank 
of aschool. At present the student selects with serious deliberation 
the lectures which he intends to hear. (2) The teacher feels himself 
obliged to offer something in return that is worth being paid for; fur-
-P-A-G-E-322
  
  294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
thermore, upon the results of his efforts his future income is, in a 
measure, dependent; hence he is spurred on by two considerations to 
doing his best. To me there seems to be no doubt whatever about this. 
If the payment for lectures were abolished, and replaced by an 
increase in the salary, the professors would be exposed to the strongest 
temptation to diminish their work in quantity and quality—that is, pro- 
fessorships would become sinecures, the real hard work being done by 
assistants. The ancient clergy offers an example of this, and other 
examples could be found nearer at hand. Foreign countries that have 
abolished lecture fees show the results. The number of hours per 
week a German professor devotes to lectures appears astonishing to 
foreigners. 
The tendency of human nature toward giving the least possible meas- 
ure of work for a certain fixed remuneration is proverbial; to this ten- 
dency the nature of the German professor offers no exception. The 
necessary consequence would then be increased supervision and control. 
Hence in this regard also the lecture fees are a protection of academic 
liberty. This payment is to be perpetuated, thirdly, because it makes 
the university professor, in a measure, independent of the government; 
if he had no income but his salary, he would be an officer and nothing 
but-an officer. Hence the payment for lectures is a very essential in- 
stitution for the preservation of the ancient free character of the Ger- 
man university. Its abolishment would have the tendency to change 
the university into a strictly managed professional school with fixed 
courses and regulations for students. But that would be the end of the 
university in the German sense of the term. The liberty it grants is its 
main power of attraction, and that the professorship is not really an 
office, but a free calling, gives it a peculiar charm in the eyes of the best 
and most liberal minds. 
Teaching.—As has been said in the éntroduction, the character and 
object of a university teacher is determined by the fact that he is both 
investigator and teacher. The former is considered the more important; 
not his success in teaching, but his scientific performances chiefly de- 
cide his appointment or election. His success as a teacher is dependent 
to a great degree on his ability to induce the students to scientific work 
and train them scientifically. However, this question is not of equal 
importance in the different sciences. What has been said has refer- 
ence chiefly to the philosophic faculty, while in the law and medical 
faculties doubtless more emphasis is laid upon talent for teaching; the 
minister of education may insist upon pedagogical skill more than the 
colleagues do when they propose names of candidates. 
With regard to the form of instruction we distinguish two kinds— 
lectures and exercises. ‘ : 
Lectures are the chief part of academic instruction; in most branches 
they take the first place. They are specially mentioned in the profes- 
sor’s contract; in this it is customary to mention his obligation for a 
public as well as a private lecture course.
-P-A-G-E-323
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 295 
The difference between public and private lectures consists in this— 
the former are gratuitous, while for the latter a fee is charged. There 
is also this difference, that the systematic chief branches of the faculty- 
sciences, are, as a rule, treated in private lectures, while the public 
lectures usually treat of less important subjects, either supplementary 
sciences or the explanation of an author, or a group of problems which 
awaken general interest. The difference is seen also in the fact that 
public lecture courses require Shorter time, mostly one or two hours 
per week, while the private lecture courses require from four to six 
hours per week, some even twice as much time. 
The lecture as a form of academic instruction has often been made 
the object of bitter and sarcastic criticism. Since the days of Fichte 
and Schleiermacher, it has often been reiterated “that the professors 
are the only men who still dare to ignore the invention of the art of 
printing.” It is said that “year after year they dictate now, as they 
did five hundred years ago, unprinted text-books to patient listeners. 
This method may have been necessary during the Middle Ages;” to-day, 
itis said, ‘most sciences can be acquired faster and more reliably from 
books. Attendance at a university is nothing but an expensive luxury, 
and a rather dangerous one to boot.” 
Indeed, if it were a fact that the lecturer merely dictated unprinted. 
text-books, then, to speak with Schleiermacher, we can not con- : 
ceive “why such a man asks the people to come tohim, and why he 
does not sell his wisdom in the usual way, a wisdom that resembles a 
stagnant pool, for to speak of the wonderful impressiveness -of the 
human voice in such antiquated work would be ridiculous.” At pres- 
ent such cases are rare exceptions, at least outside of the law faculty, 
where the ancient practice is still in vogue to some extent for good 
reasons. In the science of law there is a good deal of unchangeable 
impersonal knowledge, cast in permanent form; besides, there is a 
multiplicity of lecture courses in the faculty, which makes it difficult, if 
not impossible, to refrain from routine repetition. The professors of 
no other faculty are required to conduct three or four private lecture 
courses at the same time. The real lecture, the animated oral trans- 
mission of thought, is justified to-day as well asin the times of Aris- 
totle and St. Thomas, who, by the way, did not dictate, and to whose 
students books and the art of reading were not unknown. The lecture 
cannot be made superfluous by the most*perfect text-book; it has an 
entirely different objectin view, which may be expressed in this way: 
It is to give, in a series of connected talks, from the whole range of a 
particular science, from its fundamental problems and leading ideas, 
from its essential inventory and the manner of acquiring new accumu- 
lations, from its connection with the whole realm of science and the 
essential aims of life, a peculiar view which is matured by individual 
absorption of the matter and borne by personal life. On the other 
hand, it cannot be its object to transmit the whole accumulated matter
-P-A-G-E-324
    296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
of any science together with the complete bibliography. If in this the 
lecture course were to replace the text-book, it would always fall short 
and deserve the reproaches quoted in the foregoing paragraph. Even 
a small-sized text-book would be superior to the most carefully prepared 
lecture incompleteness of matter, exactness of dates, and bibliographical 
information. ‘ 
To him who first approaches the study of a science, be it theology or 
jurisprudence, philology or history, natural science or medicine, it 
appears as something infinite and beyond his grasp; a vast abundance 
of facts, books, problems, opinions, investigations, overwhelming and 
perplexing him. Here, now, begins the task of the lecturer, to take 
him by the hand and serve him as a guide. He leads the student in 
gradual development to see the entirety of the science; he shows him 
the most important facts and problems, and gives leading points of 
view for their comprehension and solution; he makes him familiar with 
the possible aims and the essential forms in which they have appeared 
historically, and at the same_time points out the direction in which a 
decision is likely to be reached. 
All this may be contained in a book also; as is well known, many 
books originate in lectures. But for an introduction the animated 
talk of the professor has very important advantages; above all this, that 
science appears to the listener in the form of a person who possesses 
it and lives in it; this gives him at once an immediate relation to the 
subject; it gives him faith in its value and reality. A book is an 
abstract and dead thing, which cannot generate faith. Faith can only 
be propagated from person to person. That aman who stands before 
me and speaks to me, a man whom I respect-and in whom I gain confi- 
dence, believes in this particular science, devotes his strength and his 
life to it, that is what awakens in me a feeling of its reality, as it were. 
We have a similar experience with regard to foreign countries of which 
we have read in books and heard in schools. When some one comes who 
has been there himself, has worked and lived there for years and tells us 
of these countries and their peoples, describes the journey thither, and 
offers views of work and gain to be found there, then it is that a feel- 
ing of reality of these things comes over us. Africa and America are 
not then on paper any longer, where so many things are described that 
never existed, but in tangible, accessible reality; and with the belief 
in their reality grows the ceurage to go and see them ourselves. Just 
so itis with the student and the sciences. To the future historian or 
philologist the past assumes real'ty in the words of the teacher who 
stands before him in person. Thus trifles which no science can pass 
by, commentaries, fragments, micrological observations, and tiresome 
definitions assume significance and reality in the eyes of the student, 
without which he would lose the courage for hard work. It was in 
this way, if a personal reminiscence may be indulged in, that Trendel- 
enburg awakened the courage of his studehts to study Aristotle.
-P-A-G-E-325

They had heard something of the philosophy of the ancient Greeks, 
had even tried to read it, but the uncertainty as to whether it would 
be worth while, whether Aristotle was not too antiquated, deterred 
them. But when in Trendelenburg a man approached them who lived 
in the Aristotelean philosophy, and, as it were, stood in’a personal 
relation to the Greeks, then faith in the subject was awakened, faith 
also in its significance for the present, and from faith courage resulted 
to penetrate into the strange world of thought. ; 
The ancient saying of Aristotle still holds good: ‘He who desires to 
learn inust believe.” To keep him to this belief is the first and, per- 
haps, the most important advantage oral instruction has over the book. 
The presence of fellow students and co-workers is also an advantage 
not to be forgotten. 
One more point. The book is something finished, inflexible; the lec- 
ture is something alive and growing. This difference is observable at 
once: The book is there as a whole; the lecture course offers, from hour 
to hour, a small measurable portion. Noris this portion brought along 
as something finished, that may be shown around, but a thing brought 
forth before the hearer. It is well known how much more animated 
sympathy we bestow upon the origin and development of a thing than 
upon the finished object; hence, a map which the teacher sketches, with 
a few lines, on the board, representing the mere outtiies of a country 
or a plan, will impress itself upon the memory better and deeper than 
the much more complete map of an atlas. The tension with which the 
listener follows the spirited thought of the lecturer can not possibly 
be provoked by a book. This tension has its influence upon the lec- 
turer also. While thus he enters into reciprocal relation with his 
hearers, the moment gives proper form, the fitting word, and the con- 
vincing simile. In contact with his hearers he feels what part of all the 
mass of information he has at his command is useful and serviceable, 
and what is sterile subtlety and useless ballast. 
Finally, the essential difference between the inner form of the lecture 
and that of the text-book may be pointed out. The text-book aims at a 
unity in the systematic course and prefers to progress, with synthetic 
method, from principles to the particular thing. The lecturer can move 
with much more freedom; he does not need to adhere to a fixed scheme, 
but can change his method with every new chapter, if it will serve his 
purpose pedagogically to proceed in a different way. Usually he will 
be inclined to prefer the analytic way. He will not begin with exhaust- 
ive explanations, with definitions and principles, but start from well- 
known facts and phenomena to lead to the definition; or, to use an 
expression of Aristotle, he will proceed from the zpérepov zpds Gnas to the 
xpézepor gbcet, from that which is near to the listener to certain hypoth- 
eses, while the text-book constantly impels toward synthetic develop- 
ment. 
Furthermore, the text-book aims at completeness, symmetry, and
-P-A-G-E-326
  298 EDUCATION REPORT 1891-92. 
exactness of details. The lecturer is freer in this; he may yield to his_ 
. own, vr to the interest of the listener, by dwelling a little on one chap- 
ter, and hastily passing over another, though it may not be less impor- 
tant as a part of the system. The lecture is not to be a book of refer- 
ence of which completeness, symmetrical treatment, and exactness is 
required, but it is merely to lead to a correct conception of the subject. 
For that purpose different matter may serve as means if applied in 
various ways.. The lecture would not suffer if occasionally new facts 
and questions of the day that are apt to arouse general attention are 
interwoven. It would be unwise to disdain a lively interest that offers 
itself almost unsolicited; on the other hand, it would be foolish to give 
way to it always. Of course the lecturer will beware of burdening 
his talk with many dates and details, such as are found in a book of 
reference. The details he offers will serve as methodical examples and 
illustrations, for to impress upon the memory of the hearer the whole 
mass of detail would be a hopeless undertaking. That which the stu- 
dent is to take away from a lecture can not be a mind full of facts 
nor a notebook useful for purposes of repetition, but a general view of 
the science under discussion, a view of its important and essential fea- 
tures, enlivened by the aspect it assumes under the presentation of the 
professor, in whom the science is personified, so to speak. If the stu- 
dent gains this view he will the better find his way through the science 
and also profit by the use of reference books. The best thing a lecture 
can give is effective categories and leading ideas; a book can not do 
that as well as a lecture, and therefore there will be lectures ag well as 
text-books as long as scientific instruction is given. 
The lecture may also be considered from another standpoint: It does 
not only serve him who hears it, but likewise him who gives it. Every 
repetition of a lecture offers the professor an opportunity to re-review 
the entire matter, to compare new literature on the subject, to seek a 
new and better form for his thoughts; in short, it does exactly what a 
new edition of a work requires of an author. It does even more, since 
it awakens a livelier interest than the mere editing of one’s own book. 
The fact that German text books of jurisprudence, for instance, are 
used all over the world, may be considered a proof positive of the asser- 
tion that the professors profit by their own lectures. 
A saying of Goethe, which v. Savigny quotes in his exposé on this 
subject, may conclude this reflection: 
Writing is a misuse of the language, private reading a dreary substitute for 
speech. Man produces an effect upon man only+through the influence of his per- 
sonality. 
The fact that the lecture can not be compensated for by the book be- 
comes unquestionable where a comprehensive view plays an essential 
réle; thns, for instance, where an experiment is the center of observation, 
as it is in experimental physics and chemisiry, or in physiology; also 
where oral explanation concerning an object is nécessary, as in the clinic, 
or in archxology, or in the history of art. _ Since this form of instrue-
-P-A-G-E-327
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 299 
  tion has been extended more and more during our century, it may be 
said that the lecture is in no danger of becoming superfluous; on the 
contrary it is likely to be more and more necessary. 
The significance of the lecture predetermines its form; it does what 
it should do only when it is a free lecture, that is to say, when it is not 
read. Naturally this can not_mean an extemporary talk, which, both 
in matter and form, is the result of the moment. That would be an 
impossible thing. No one is in such complete possession of a science 
that the whole and its parts would be at all times at his disposal, and 
even then it would be necessary to arrange the matter beforehand, for 
a systematic arrangement is not always the same which is required by 
pedagogical considerations. Hence the lecture must be prepared; that, 
‘as a rule, leads to the making of notes in a note-book. This book may 
be filled more or less, according to the nature of the subject and the. 
professor’s familiarity with it; at times it may contain the whole lec- 
ture word for word, again it may confine itself to an exact articulation 
and disposition of the course of thought, at other times it may contain 
nothing but chief dates, formulas, and catchwords. ‘To do without the 
note-book would be expecting unreasonable things, it would certainly 
not be profitable to the student. Nor will there be any objection to it 
if the professor brings his notes into the class-room to consult his plan 
or quote some formulas, facts and authorities. The lecture is not to be 
an oratorical masterpiece, nor a sermon the impression of which would 
suffer through being read. All that is wanted is a simple unassuming 
representation of thoughts which appeals to the intellect. In one thing 
the lecture must be free, that is, the eyes of the professor must not be 
fastened on the page, and the thoughts must readily find the proper 
expression desirable at the moment. Reading of a completely finished 
manuscript must not take place, if the essential object of the lecture is 
not to be lost. A lecture read from manuscript is without life, it can 
not give that feeling of reality which is caused by a free talk that flows 
directly from the mind. Nor does it create that intense attention in 
the lecturer and his hearers that charms free speech, for that needs the 
excitement of free formation of thought and the risk of failure. 
A procedure frequently found is changing about from dictation to ex- 
planation in off-hand speech. The leading thoughts are dictated, then 
explained in order to secure an exact comprehension of essentials. 
But in this procedure, if a little too much is dictated, something of the 
effect of the lecture may be lost. The contents in that case appear as 
something fixed, while the kind deception, as though the result had to 
be discovered by fresh investigation and self-thought, is dispelled. 
Indolent students would be apt to rely upon copying the pages of 
others, and consider the moments filled with explanations as pauses 
for recreation and rest from writing. If nothing is dictated, the 
student is obliged to think for himself, to find the essential points, and 
to fix them in a form of his own. But there seems to be no possible  
-P-A-G-E-328
300 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  objection to a printed syllabus whichis to easethe work of the student, 
and free the lecture from the very inconvenient statements of biblio- 
graphy and the like. 
The Seminaries.—An important aid to the lectures is at present 
offered in what is known as seminary exercises. They have,.so to 
speak, taken the place of the disputations held in the Middle Ages. 
But their character is different, they are not intended to effect a trans- 
mnittal of knowledge, but aid in producing knowledge. The seminaries 
are the real nurseries of scientific investigation. Originally they had 
another purpose; the first seminaries established during the last cen- 
tury at Halle and Gottingen were philological institutions; that is to 
say, they were intended for the preparation of future teachers of sec- 
ondary schools; hence normal schools (to use an American term. The 
_translator). In fact, however, these first seminaries, notably that of F. 
A. Wolf, were institutions in which the technique of philologic investi- 
gation was taught. This is true also of the philologic seminaries and 
societies conducted during the nineteenth century by G. Hermann, Fr. 
Thiersch, Fr. Ritschl and others. They were schools for philologists, 
not for teachers. The same may be said of the numerous seminaries 
that have in recent years been-established for the other sciences within 
tke philosophic faculty, also in the theological and law faculties. With 
few exceptions they have the outspoken purpose to give instruction in 
scientific work and investigation, and not how to apply science in any 
practical pursuit. 
It is not the place here to review the various institutions of this kind 
and their mode of procedure. Generally, instruction given in semina- 
ries takes this form: Scientific problems of investigation are given 
and worked out under the guidance of the professor. The philologist, 
the historian, the political economist, gives out a problem, the solution 
of which is possible to the student with the means at his disposal. The 
professor designates the material that may be used, and then allows 
him to find his own way to a solution. The essay he hands in is laid 
before one or two fellow-students, who are to examine it and report to 
the professor and students in session, where the weak and strong points 
of the work are pointed out. In a similar way the exercises of the 
seminaries in the theologic and law faculties are conducted. Asa mat- 
ter of course, in the naturals ciences the seminary exercises are differ- 
ent. Here the execution of the work in hand is effected under the 
direct guidance of the teacher-or his assistant. Where the utilization 
of literary sources is the essential object, reading of the original matter 
is done in class. In presence of ‘the teacher Latin or Greek texts are 
interpreted, or historical monuments, or different sources of information 
are compared, or some philosophic or theologic authors are read and 
discussed with reference to their leading ideas. Side by side with these 
real seminaries should be mentioned the official institutes maintained 
by the State, that have their own class rooms and library, and also the 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
  
* GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 301 
  private societies and mutual exercises, all of which are announced every 
half year in the official list of lessons. 
A third kind of exercises is to be mentioned which is closely con- 
nected with the lectures, the so-called repetitories and conservatories. 
Their object is to secure the comprehension of the lecture, to solve diffi- 
culties, to answer queries, and to practice the student in using the 
- eategories and definitions of his science. However desirable these 
exercises may appear (the Prussian minister of education, Eichhorn, 
recommended them to the universities very warmly some fifty years 
ago), they have not yet assumed great importance or considerable 
extent. The cause of this may be that the necessity for such exercises 
is wanting: They presuppose an intimate personal relation between 
teacher and student, such as is the casein a school, but in a university, 
at least in the large lectures, and owing to the frequent change of pro- 
fessors, that intimate relation between teacher and student can not 
exist. With a great number of persons unknown to each other and to 
him, the professor can not use a dialogic method. Also the apprehen- 
sion of meeting mocking glances in consequence of poor answers may 
be an obstacle to this kind of exercise. A conservatory would end, 
under these circumstances, in the teacher giving occasional supplemen- 
tary lectures induced by questions or erroneous answers, without being 
able to see how far they would meet the general necessity. For the 
law faculty exer cises of this kind and practical application in connee- 
tion with the lectures have recently gained greater importance. 
The liberty of teaching —The task of the university professor pre- 
supposes liberty of teaching. If he is to be an independent scientific 
investigator, and if he is to educate his students to be the same, that 
which he is to teach must not be prescribed to him. 
The thing is different in schools. Here itis not a question of searching 
for new, but of acquiring old truth. The pupil is not to judge, but to 
accept what is offered him, and, therefore, the teacher offers generally 
accepted knowledge. Of course, we understand that universities began 
as schools in this sense; during the Middle Ages the transmission and 
acceptation of knowledge contained in canonic texts was the main 
object, and during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries this view 
remained in force. But during the eighteenth century, as has been 
stated before, a great change took place. Thereafter the consequences 
of the Reformation, and at the same time the consequences of the 
complete revolution in the view of the cosmos, that has since taken 
place through cosmologic scientific investigations, were accepted; it 
was recognized that the truth is not anything fixed, but produced by 
progressive work in scientific investigation. Dogmatic theology and 
Avistotelean philosophy lost their canonie value. Placing themselves 
on this ground, the German universities assumed an entirely different 
form. The student ceased to be a scholar in the old sense of the word, 
and the professor now became really what his title signified; he now 
     
-P-A-G-E-330
  302 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92> | 
professes personal views and convictions. That has been his right and 
his duty ever since. 
This is generally accepted everywhere. No one reproaches a physi- 
cist, or physiologist, a philologist, or a historian for lecturing on new, 
instead of confining himself to generally accepted theories; all that is 
required is, that he should furnish good reasons for his new views. 
Only with reference to theology and philosophy occasional attempts 
are made to limit the liberty of teaching. 
With reference to theology ecclesiastic authorities and church par- 
ties object to the liberty of teaching. They assume that the church 
is in possession of absolute truth that has been formulated in dog- 
mas. The dogma can allow only believing acceptance; doubt and 
criticism are not permitted. The object of the professor of the theo- 
logic faculty can only be to instruct the servants of the church in that 
which the church teaches, also to secure them immunity against doubt 
by showing them the invalidity of all objections to the dogmas. For 
this reason the treatment of heresies is an important part of the instruc- 
tion; all possible forms of error, likewise the causes of their rejection 
are shown. The servant of the church is thereby equipped to recog- 
nize and eradicate newly arising errors as heresies that have long been 
rejected. 
The Roman Catholic church has insisted upon its claim to control- 
ling the teaching of theology. In Catholic faculties only approved 
instruction is given; the professors are servants of the church. 
The thing is greatly different in Protestantism. The university 
professors of theology intend to be, first of all, servants of science, and 
to be servants of the church only as servants of science, in so far as no 
clergyman can do without scientific education. From this arises a 
constant conflict between the claims of the church and the demands of 
science, which conflict is sometimes held in abeyance, and sometimes 
breaks out in public, and becomes vociferous. The professor appeals 
to his right and his duty to teach what he has recognized as the result 
of scientific research. The representatives of the church, official or 
voluntary, reproach him for teaching differently from what the church 
and the creed demand its disciples to believe, hence, it is claimed, he 
ean not be a teacher of the servants of the church, ‘Ihe representa- 
tive of the state in the person of the minister of education, who has the 
general supervision of the universities, and therefore also of the theolog- 
ical faculties, is like the index of the scales; at times the objections 
of the ecclesiastics weigh heavier, and then repression of theories and 
teachers that are held to be anticlerical takes place; at times the 
liberty of scientific research weighs more, anil then the state holds its 
protecting hand over the one who is attacked, Generally the scales 
have been in favor of untrammeled teaching in recent times, and this 
explains the dissatisfaction of the orthodox party with the present regu- 
lations, and hence their demand to allow the ecclesiastical authorities 
a direct control over the theological faculties.
-P-A-G-E-331
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 303 
It has been stated in the foregoing pages why these efforts must 
appear without a prospect of suecess: They are hostile to the spirit of 
the universities as well as to that of the Protestant church. In the © 
Protestant church belief is not based upon external authority, hence no 
doctrine can be placed upon it. Between the creed of the church and 
that which the faculties teach, there is possible only a relation of free 
accordance, never that of absolute subordination. In the Catholic 
church the principle of absolute subjection rules supreme; the Protes- 
tant church is everywhere built upon the principle of free acknowledg- 
ment. Of course, the former is the simpler, but the simpler is not also 
always the better or the more secure. There is nothing simple about 
life, while mechanism has the advantage of simplicity. Absolutism in 
the life of the state is also simpler than the constitutional monarchy, 
yet it has become impossible, and the state now rests upon the free 
accordance of the two factors, an accordance that can not be forced. 
A similar condition exists in the relation between scientific theology 
and the Protestant church.- Together they have grown up and be- 
come what they are, often while fighting one another; but on earth, as 
Heraclitos said, “ without war no life.” 
He who does not want liberty in teaching must finally come to eccle- 
siastical seminaries and exercises; things which are in harmony with 
the Catholic, but would be the end of the Protestant church; as the 
former is based upon discipline, the latter is based upon freedom, from” 
the very beginning; and for the churches holds good what has been 
said of states, namely, that they are preserved by the same powers that 
have originated them. 
The other science which has at times to defend its liberty is philoso- 
phy. It is attacked by the same opponents who are hostile to freedom 
in theologic teaching. From philosophy is expected a limitation aris- 
ing from a demand for accordance with church doctrines. In the 
Catholic press and Catholic conventions it is constantly complained 
that our universities allow an atheistic philosophy which has tended 
to undermine faith and corrupt youth. The lecture rooms are said to 
be the real nurseries of revolution, of social democracy, and anarch- 
ism. It would be futile to combat these if the real sources of the 
epidemic were left untouched. In a part of the Protestant press this 
view finds a vivid echo. 
This is not the place to investigate whether these complaints are 
well founded, whether feally atheistic philosophy is taught in the 
German universities, and whether it has the consequences alluded to. 
But the reply may be couched in a word; it is, that a philosophy under 
control is nothing and can do nothing. 
Philosophy, in fact, is nothing but the attempt which every epoch 
repeats to give expression to the essence and the meaning of reality 
as it appears to the human mind which contemplates it unprejudiced. 
All sciences, natural as well as mental sciences, bring together building
-P-A-G-E-332
  304 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
stones for the recognition of reality, and since they constantly farnish 
new material, there can be no absolute and definite philosophy, at least 
not until reality has been completely exhausted by science. Every epoch 
has to renew the attempt of formulating the latest conclusion based. 
upon all accumulated knowledge, and that is its philosophy. Nothing 
will hinder it in learning from similar attempts in former epochs, both 
in regard to form and contents. Historical development will appear as 
amatter of self-evidence, and it may beexpected that a philosophy will be 
the more vital and fertile, the more faithfully it utilizes the acquisitions 
of former processes of thought. But one point it can not yield without 
imperiling its own existence, i. e., the right to examine the thoughts of 
older thinkers, and, as necessity requires, to remodel or reject them. 
A philosophy which would remove this right, which would accept cer- 
tain thoughts as unassailable and absolutely sacred from examination, 
would be no philosophy. Philosophy means an unprejudiced search 
for truth, that is to say, unhindered by presuppositions that must not 
be doubted or tested. i 
The same argument holds good in philosophic instruction in universi- 
ties. It would cease to be philosophic if subjected to any other control 
than free investigation. It would cease to be fertile, as soon as external 
control should be exercised. Philosophie instruction can be effective 
only if the student is certain of finding free and unhindered expres- 
. sion of his teacher’s conviction formed according to his best knowledge 
and belief. We find this a matter of course for all other sciences. 
We should not expect much of instruction in mathematics and physics, 
philology and history, if it. based its theories on certain presupposi- 
tions that must not be examined and tested, or aimed at reaching 
certain conclusions predetermined by external authority. Precisely 
that is claimed for philosophy. <A prerequisite of its effectiveness is 
the confidence of the student that he is not dealing with humbug. 
Kant said: 
It is absurd to demand enlightenment from human reason, and prescribe at the 
same time what form it is to take, and on what side of the question the decision 
is to fall. 
The student is fully aware of this. If he knows or thinks that the 
professor of philosophy must have certain views, or at least that he 
is not allowed to entertain certain others, he will not be inclined to 
think much of his instruction. What he wishes to hear in philosophic 
lectures are not views which are officially prescribed or sanctioned, 
but thoughts represented by aman who has devoted thorough study to 
the great questions of the world and life, and stands up for them as for 
his personal convictions. 
Idealistic philosophy especially has a deep interest in not Toserane 
other currents of thought from making themselves felt. Every limita- 
tion of this liberty would awaken a suspicion of insincerity, and destroy 
its effectiveness. Hence, so far as the matter of instruction is con- 
cerned, perfect freedom, “libertas philosophandi” is a prerequisite of
-P-A-G-E-333
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 305 
successful university instruction. Every invasion of this freedom 
engenders irritation on the part of him who is thus disciplined, and 
on the part of the learner distrust of the views prescribed and officially 
protected. 
The limits of the untrammeled right to teach refer only to the form 
of instruction; here they may be drawn tighter than the law provides. 
The lecturer is limited first by a consideration for the place he occupies 
and its dignity. To, treat with scorn and derision things which are 
venerable to others, may not be forbidden to the public press or speak- 
ers in public assemblies, but respect for his profession will forbid the 
professor to do so. His duty is to lead his students to search for truth. 
Truth never admits of contumely. The professor will not even indulge 
in a disdainful and deprecating treatment of the views of others, which 
he does not share. If they deserve such a treatment, being entirely 
perverse, he will avoid rather than combat them. For, what would it 
profit to make his hearers familiar with what fools say, or have said, - 
since so much time and attention is claimed by that, which wise men 
have said? If he will warn his hearers of error, he must show it in its 
relative strength; that which is absurd deceives and misleads no one. 
And then he is limited by this other consideration, that no reply is pos- 
sible in the lecture room. The press, public assemblies, and parliament 
are public places, where the party attacked may defend himself, but in 
the lecture room only one person speaks. Hence it is the professor’s 
duty, when he attacks, to allow the other side to be heard by quoting 
it. In a certain sense he must be prosecutor and defender in one — 
person, otherwise he could not act as a judge. A consideration for 
his hearers will guide him in this. An orator wants to capture the 
judgment of his hearers, so that they follow him blindfold, but the 
professor wants to free his hearers; he intends to guide them in acquir- 
ing individual, self-active observation and judgment. He can do that 
only if he has accustomed himself to look at both sides of a question, 
and can impartially represent them. 
IV.—THE STUDENTS AND THEIR WORK. 
The years of university study are the blossoming springtime of life. 
That which gives them that sunny luster in the remembrance of the 
man, as well as in the expectation of the pupil, is the golden freedom 
they bring with them. Indeed, it is the time of the greatest and fullest 
freedom a man can ever enjoy. Coming from the parental home and 
from school, which hedged him in by fixed rules and regulations, the 
young man is left to rely upon himseif entirely. His exterior life is 
regulated to suit hisown will. He selects his own associates and envi- 
ronment, Likewise does he determine his interior life. He chooses 
his own science and his teachers; he sets himself the tasks he intends 
to do every day; or he may neglect to do so, His life is wholly free; 
for what he does he is responsible to himself only. 
ED 92——20
-P-A-G-E-334
    306 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Later life limits this liberty in many ways. The family sets up a 
thousand claims and causes much care; the student has to attend to 
no one but himself. When he enters his profession or an office, una- 
voidable demands are to be met; he has to curb himself in thought 
and speech; his thoughts soon learn to subordinate themselves to prac- 
tical demands, they soon lose the ability to rise into the infinite realm 
of possibility; reality becomes the measure of thought. That is the 
realism of manhood. He who wishes to accomplish anything must 
seize upon things and opportunities, and can not indulge in roaming in 
the realm of possibility. This realism is in contrast with the idealism 
of the student; youth measures reality with ideas, and becomes enthu- 
siastic in the belief that it can remodel the world by means of ideas. 
Idealism is the prerogative of youth, perhaps also a danger; just as 
realism may be both a prerogative and a danger to edvanced age. 
Preparation for study.—The legal requirement for admission to uni- 
versity study is the same in all German states, namely, a graduation 
diploma from a gymnasium; it is acquired by passing the final examin- 
ation with which a gymnasial course is concluded. It is true, other 
educated young men are matriculated in the university without such a 
diploma, but only in the philosophic faculties, and without acquiring the 
right of being admitted to state examinations, which open the gates to 
the learned professions. The course of study in a gymnasium is one 
of nine years, which must not begin before the completed ninth year of 
age. Beside these classical gymnasia, the so-called Real-gymnasia, that 
have a course of nine years also, are entitled to prepare students for 
the university, but only for certain studies of the philosophic faculty, 
i, e., mathematics, natural sciences, and modern Janguages, while the 
higher faculties require the student to have graduated from a classical 
gymnasia. Whether this exclusion will continue seems doubtful to 
“many, and it is often urged that the study of medicine might be. 
opened without danger to the graduates of Real-gymnasia. Perhaps 
we Shall return to the former usage of giving to the individual much 
more liberty in the selection of his preparatory course. A hundred 
years ago the university was open to every one who was equipped 
with an ordinary school education. The requirement of a graduation 
diploma from any high school of a nine years’ course would appar- 
ently suffice to exclude unsuitable elements. 
Students’ age and-length of the course of study.—The university study 
falls into the time of transition from youth to manhood. Onan average 
the years from the twentieth to the twenty-fifth are devoted to this 
- study. Only a hundred years ago the average age of the student 
was considerably lower; admission to the university was frequently 
granted to very young students, likewise also to much older students 
than now. The two extremes were much farther apart. The causes of 
this change is to be found in the extension of the preparatory course. 
The students now come, with the exception of a very small percent-

GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 307 
age, from gymnasia that have a fixed prescribed course. The exterior 
extension of this course is closely related to its inner growth: The 
course in classic languages, which, during the last century, embraced 
almost the entire language instruction, has received additions in the 
modern languages and sciences. German, French, mathematics, nat- 
ural science, history and geography are now essential, where formerly 
they were either subordinate branches or taught incidentally. Natu- 
rally, the opinion is now prevalent that the freshman has completed his 
preparatory studies, and can turn at once to his professional study, 
while during the eighteenth century the completion of his general 
studies was to take place in the university, and it was done by attend- 
ing some courses of the philosophic faculty, which was considered a 
kind of intermediate stage leading up to the higher faculties. 
The legal duration of university study in Germany varies between 
three and four and a half years. In Prussia the law prescribes three 
years, but for the study of medicine four and a half years. Insother 
countries, for instance, in Bavaria, four years is the limit for a profes- 
sional study. As a matter of fact, though, the length of the course 
exceeds the legal requirement on the average quite considerably; the 
triennium of the philosophic faculty is always found insufficient, and 
four or more years are devoted to it. To the years of actual study is 
usually added a year of preparation for the examinations. The military 
service, lasting one year, is included in these statements. 
The demand is not infrequently made, especially by jurists, that the 
legal time of university study be extended, and that the fallacy that 
the one year of military service is a year of study be rejected. How- 
ever desirable the extension of scientific study may be, its legal 
sanction meets with well-founded objections. Every extension of the 
time brings with it an increase in expenses, and hence a narrowing of 
the social circle from which the universities are recruited. Nor does 
this extension necessarily mean an extension and a deepening of the 
scientific work performed. Many who have made it possible, after 
wasting two or three years, to prepare themselves for the examinations 
during the last few semesters by means of private coaching, would sim- 
ply use this extension in order to enjoy a little longer the liberty of stu- 
dent life; and it is reasonable to suppose that many a one who, under 
the present circumstances just barely succeeds, would then entirely lose 
the capacity of saving himself from utter ruin. The purposes of study 
would be better served by adopting a suggestion made by H. von 
Sybel : 
To enable talented students who have passed examinations creditably to continue 
theirscientific study in post-graduate courses, by means of scholarships and stipends, 
Others have suggested shortening the vacation, and thus lengthening 
the course. Practical people outside the university think the vacations 
too long. It is true they consume a very considerable portion of the 
scholastic year, not much less than’ two-fifths of the year, or about
-P-A-G-E-336
  308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
twenty weeks. However much it may be appreciated that the state 
authorities oppose the natural tendency of further shortening the semes- 
ters, it can not be said that a considerable decrease of the vacations 
would serve the purposes of the university. If the vacations were 
merely thought to be a time for recreation, they might be considered 
too Jong, but in fact they are not used in that way, certainly not by the 
university professors. The German professor may be reproached for 
many a thing, but idleness certainly can not be charged to him. The 
bulk of scientific labor done in Germany is doubtless, to a great 
extent, performed during vacation. 
Nor is the vacation only a time for recreation for the students. It 
may be that some take it to be so, but they are certainly not those 
who are the most diligent during the semesters; the industrious 
always find good use for this time. But even if the vacations do inter- 
rupt study for a time no great loss will result therefrom, because a tem- 
porary. reaccustoming to the general human way of thinking and speak- 
ing causes a reaction which may prove beneficial in many cases. To 
the diligent student a long vacation will give opportunity for pleasant 
recreation, extensive excursions, and desirable periods of quiet, con- 
nected work. This consideration is not of equal force for all students; 
those who chiefly work with books, like the theologian, the law student, 
and philologist, can make the best use of their vacation. 
It is more difficult for the students of medicine or natural science, 
~ because they will miss the laboratories and other institutions. But for 
them also a few weeks of steady reading cannot bean unmitigated evil. 
For the older students of medicine the opportunity for hard study is 
offered in the vacation courses. Perhaps a similar arrangement may be 
made possible for the other branches of scientific investigation. Thus, 
for instance, the chemical laboratories that are often overcrowded during 
the semester could be opened for vacation courses under the direction 
of assistants. Many an older student, and some practitioners, who 
lack arrangements and means for difficult investigations, would gladly 
make use of such opportunities. 
Outer conditions of life—As has been said before, the nineteenth 
century has done away with the last remnants of ancient school regu- 
lations. Nowhere in Germany can anything be found like the “ burses” 
of the Middle Ages, or the college halls of England and America. The 
student takes lodgings where he can find them; ina large city he must 
be satisfied with one room; in smaller university towns he can afford 
to rent in addition a second room for a bed-room. In the latter places 
he takes his lodgings for the semester; in the large cities for the month. 
His board he takes in restaurants, now here, now there. His inter- 
course in families is as a rule very limited; many a student who has no 
relatives in the place or brings no letters of introduction may live for 
years in a university town without coming in contact with a family. 
That this occasions a great want of comfort in living, in health, and
-P-A-G-E-337
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 309 
in social culture cannot be doubted. The conditions in lodgings are 
not infrequently very disadvantageous; lack of cleanliness and com- 
fort, and noise, make quiet study impossible and threaten health, life, 
and morality. An Oxford college is certainly a better place for study 
than a wretched room in a tenement barrack. Granted that we cannot 
have such institutions as the English colleges, for they are the result 
of centuries and clothed with the reminiscences of generations, but 
wemight have students’ houses of modest dimensions that could offer a 
comfortable, secure, and reposeful home to our students, with or without 
the element of living in common, without increasing the costs of attend- 
ing a university. These houses would have the further advantage of 
social intercourse and combined work, while under the present cireum- 
stances many a student suffers severely from isolation. 
We must not, however, deceive ourselves by neglecting to state that 
our students do not show great inclination for this kind of institution. 
Where they exist (the Melanchthon House in Berlin is such an insti- 
tution) the demand for rooms is not great. Evidently the cause is 
found in the fact that absolute freedom of action is valued higher than 
all the advantages such a house may offer. To be subjected to regula- 
tions necessary in such an institution, however limited they may be, 
and though their execution may be left to the. lodgers themselves, is 
hard, for they still express a restraint to personal freedom, and are 
felt as “capitis deminutio,” of which students are ashamed. This may 
be the result of the disinclination and awe with which everything is 
regarded in Germany that reminds one, even remotely, of church and 
school discipline. Another obstacle to the institution of students’ 
homes is the frequency with which the students change their universi- 
ties, for such homes presuppose a stationary habitation and continu- 
ous attendance of the students, as found in English and American 
universities. 
A word concerning the expenses may not be amiss. The expenses 
of the great majority of German students, not counting in the four or 
five months of vacation, range between 1,000 and 2,000 marks ($250 to- 
$500); the average may be between 1,200 and 1,500 marks ($300 to 
$375). A small number will exceed these sums considerably, and 
a greater number may get along with less than the average. In the 
latter case, scholarships and stipends, and free admission to lectures, 
private income from giving lessons, correcting proofs, doing shorthand 
work, etc., make this possible. The benefices or stipends are derived 
from public means and private bequests; the latter are mostly of 
ancient date, and the older universities are quite lavishly provided 
with them. But since the purchasing power of money is so greatly 
reduced from what it formerly was, the benefices are mostly quite 
insignificant. Public benefices are relics of a time in which the insuf- 
ficient supply of students led to artificial means of encouragement. 
To do this was thought a political necessity, in order to recruit the
-P-A-G-E-338
    310 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
governing class with the necessary well prepared elements. With this 
intention the government of each State established dormitories during 
the sixteenth century. But since then the rising wealth, and the 
increased respect for the learned professions, have caused an overpro- 
duction of professionally educated people, and the dispositions referred 
to have lost their former importance to a great extent. 
The fact that students change their universities frequently in Ger- 
many is an ancient custom based upon the migratory tendency of the 
ancient Germans. The number of those who pass the entire time of 
their study in the university of their home province isnotlarge. Most 
students attend at least-a second, many a third and a fourth, university. 
Though this may be overdone to such an extent that the student never 
becomes domesticated and wastes time and strength in changing about, 
yet, as a general rule, an occasional change is not without great profit. 
Above all, an exchange of students between north and south is of great 
importance. About 2,000 students from north Germany, as Conrad 
proves, study in south Germany; on the other hand, the south is a 
little more reserved towards the north. Even though the scientific 
results of the migration may not be very great, yet the gain in general 
culture must not be underrated. There is no period in life in which a 
man with open senses is more influenced by the outer world than this 
period, and he who has observed life abroad. will view and judge with 
greater clearness that which he finds at home; he corrects his stand- 
ards of measurement. 
Also for scientific education the change alluded to is very profitable. 
The wanderer’s observation is sharpened and he is freed from prejudices. 
Small and large universities each have their peculiar advantages. In 
the smaller ones the student will find his place more easily; personal 
intercourse with his teachers affords him many advantages. On the 
‘other hand, the large universities offer opportunities to see and hear 
the most distinguished and noted men in all branches, and to use the 
rich equipment of institutions and establishments connected with them. 
Associations and clubs.—In German universities students’ clubs are 
as characteristic as college associations are in English and American 
universities. In the life of the individual they play a similar réle; they 
form his intimate associations, determine his social intercourse, and 
mold, to a great extent, his views and habits. 
. Naturally it can not be the intention in this connection to give a 
. complete description of the varied forms of students’ club life; the prin- 
cipal features must suffice. From the great number of students’ clubs 
a féw stand forth quite prominently. They are the color-bearing fellow- 
ships. Of these there are three principal classes, “Corps,” ‘ Burschen- 
schaften” (fellowships), and “Christian societies,” besides which there 
are several other types. The “Corps” are intimately related to the 
ancient provincial corporations or nations (see p. 255); they are called 
according to German provinces and tribes (Allemans, Suevians, Borus-
-P-A-G-E-339
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. ~ sit 
sians, ete.—The translator). In every German university there is a 
smaller or greater number of ‘‘Corps;” all of them taken together form 
a large union that embraces all the German universities. It is char- 
acteristic of this group that it is chiefly recruited from wealthy and 
aristocratic circles; also that it lays much stress upon outer appear- 
ance and display, and shows a strong inclination toward aristocratic 
separation. This group claims to be the élite of the students and the 
right to represent them officially. The “ Burschenschaft” owes its 
origin to the time of the Wars of Liberation from the yoke of Napoleon. 
It was founded as an organization of the mass of students in opposi- 
tion to the “Corps,” and did not originally intend to form exclusive 
clubs, but to oppose and do away with the narrow-mindedness of the 
old club life with its various dissipations and extravagances, and to 
infuse the German student life with new ideas of its position and object 
in the life of the people, with love of country and nation, and with en- 
thusiasm for its power and freedom. Through the inimical regula- 
tions of the reactionary state, the “Burschenschaft” was forced into~ 
other channels. “Pursued and repressed, it took the form of secret soci- 
etics. But it has been most essential in contributing to,keeping the 
idea of German unity alive and developing this thought to a live 
power among the people. At present the “ Burschenschaften,” of which 
there are several in each university, are exclusive societies like the 
“Corps.” Many of them do not greatly differ from those in aspirations 
and outer appearance. Others, especially the older and more exten- 
sive ones, that have their strong roots in history, have retained a little 
of the spirit and aspirations of the old ““Burschenschaft.” Ever since the 
third decade of this century the third group of students, the “Chris- 
tian societies,” have been found side by side with “Corps” and ‘“ Bursch- 
enschaften,” mostly under the name * Wingolf.” Their constitution 
and outer appearance is like the other ‘“color-bearing” societies, only 
differing from them in the fact that they reject dueling. Another essen- 
tial difference is found in the fact that the members are almost exclu- 
sively theologians, while the other societies are not recruited exclu- 
sively from any one faculty; thus, for instance, the “Corps” reeruit 
themselves preferably from the law students, with occasional additions 
from the medical faculty. The “ Burschenschaften” recruit themselves 
from nearly all faculties; they also unite the different social strata 
more than the other kinds of societies do. In recent years Catholic stu- 
dent societies have been formed with exclusiveness and tendencies sim- 
ilar to the “ Wingolfs.” 
Side by side with the old clubs, other societies have become promi- 
nent in recent years in large universities—societies of a looser bond 
than the three kinds of clubs mentioned before. They practice arts, 
such as vocal music and gymnastics, or are devoted to mutual promo- 
tion of scientific education, some also to the fostering of certain ideas 
and theories or practical purposes. They differ from the old clubs
-P-A-G-E-340
  312 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
generally in this, that their purpose is a particular one and their 
membership not at all exclusive. These societies aim at complete com- 
munion in life, not during the time of study only. Men quite old in 
profession and office preserve an intimate connection with the members 
_of such societies. 
One is accustomed to consider the “color-beariug” and dueling | 
club student the real representative of the German students, in foreign 
countries more so than in Germany, although he is statistically in the 
minority. Scarcely five per cent of the total number of students are 
of that kind. In large universities they disappear in the mass, while 
in smaller ones they form a considerable part. 
The opinions concerning the importance and value of this kind of 
student clubs—that is, the ‘“color-bearing ” ones—differ greatly. In 
public they are judged harshly; it is said of them that they neglect 
their studies, overestimate display, and despise others haughtily; this 
is specially alleged of the Corps. And indeed the dangers are not to 
be underrated. A waste of time and strength in all kinds of frivoli- 
ties, a narrowing of the view upon human affairs, neglect of and con- 
tempt for hard study, are consequences arising from certain tenden- 
cies and the character of these clubs; they are more strongly felt in 
clubs of small membership. And yet a generally deprecatory judg- 
ment would be too hasty. It should not be forgotten that there are 
occasions and temptations for loitering and degeneracy outside of 
these clubs. If we had statistics on this point figures would prove, 
perhaps, that this group of students, as a rule, furnishes no more lost 
eases than other societies, perhaps even fewer. There are not wanting 
among these clubs such as make a special demand of its members to 
decently complete their studies, if it be best for the reputation of the 
color they bear. And again, from such a society, if no bad spirit is 
prevalent, and if its membership is not too limited, many a precious 
gain for life is made, of which an exchange of high ideas and aspi- 
rations is not the smallest. One gain is, that the society is a free, 
self-governing corporation, its members learn daily the great art of 
governing themselves and others. It may be said that there are no 
Jaws in the world which are more minutely obeyed and more strictly 
enforced than the laws which the student-clubs give themselves. But 
more, they learn how to treat friend and foe outside of their ranks; 
every misdemeanor finds sharp observers and strict judges. The result 
is a certain attitude and assurance by means of which old men betray 
their former membership in the “corps.” It would be altogether 
incomprehensible where the joy and affection should come from with 
which many old men remember their student-club life, if they owed 
nothing to it; and still less would it be comprehensible why they should 
induce their sons to join the same clubs; fathers are apt to think of 
other things for their sons than pleasures, and vanity, duels, and faces 
full of scars.
-P-A-G-E-341
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 313 
A special obstacle for many students is firm adherence to duelling, 
or the “Mensur.” There is no occasion to discuss duelling here; only 
a few words concerning students’ duelling. I do not intend to justify 
the custom, nor defend the extravagances to which it easily leads: 
to appear in provocative and bullying attitude will certainly not make 
any one appear pleasing before God and man, and a frivolous play with 
one’s own life and the lives of others is contemptible. The thing, how- 
ever, may be looked at from another stand-point. Without the motive of 
the duel, exercise in fencing would be lacking in the intense interest it 
- now has, and rob the clubs of a good deal of their discipline. In a 
certain way it is a test of courage, or rather of strength of nerve; it 
contributes towards securing the individual an estimation which is 
independent of the amount of his father’s check. Says the American 
J. M. Hart, in his book concerning the German’ universities, which is 
full of sound sense and sharp observation: ‘To fight isan evil, but 
there are other evils which are just as bad and much meaner,” and 
then he points out all sorts of occurrences that happen in Ameriean 
colleges. He says: 
The German system has at least the advantage of being manly. It holds the stu- 
dent down to the strictest responsibility for what he does and says. 
The work of the student.—The object of university study is, the ability 
to think scientifically—that is,the ability to comprehend scientific 
investigations, to test them and conduct them; secondly, to solve prac- 
tical problems in the light of scientific knowledge. 
This is what the German university conceives to be its task. It is 
not the object to have the students learn—that is, accept upon faith— 
knowledge that is offered them, but to lead them to independent 
thought, investigation and research. Naturally the student has to 
learn; to accumulate knowledge is necessary. But he who would be 
satisfied with doing that would not come up to the ideal of a Ger- 
man student. He may have been ever so diligent, have heard lectures 
regularly, and reviewed conscientiously, studied his manuals, and at 
last with the aid of his accumulated treasures have passed his exami- 
nations splendidly, yet, we would have to say, he is lacking something, 
indeed the most essential thing, that is, he has not tested his own pow- 
ers in individual investigation. H. von Sybel emphasizes this point 
by saying that the object is not to learn the entire extent of a science 
down to its last sources; that would be impossible. 
But it is essential that the student gain a clear consciousness of the purposes of 
his science, and of the operations with which its tasks are to be performed. It is 
necessary that in a few points, at least in one point, he should carry out these 
operations himself, that he should pursue a few of the problems down to the last 
consequences, to a point where he can say of himself that there is no one in this 
world who could teach him anything concerning them; here he stands firm and 
secure on his own feet and decides according to his own judgment. This conscious- 
ness of having gained self-dependence by means of his own efforts is of inestimable 
value. It is almost indifferent what subject of research he has chosen fi:st, or has 
led him on; suffice it, that he has, in one direction, in however small a compass,  
-P-A-G-E-342
  314 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
overcome the dependence upon school, he has tested his powers and means, with 
which henceforth he can seize upon new problems, and approach their solutions; 
he has in the midst of his joyous time of youth ripened to manhood. 
That is the ideal. Not all reach it, nor is it everywhere easily 
reached. For a long time it was given chiefly to the philosophic 
branches to lead their students to such an independence. At present 
the experimental sciences are almost abreast of them, if they have not 
succeeded in surpassing them. In the study of law, perhaps, it is the 
most difficult to acquire this independence, and this may be the reason 
why the professors of law complain most frequently of lack of joy and 
independence in study; the burden of actual learning is, perhaps, 
nowhere so enormous as it is in law. 
The liberty of learning.—lIt is the correlate of the liberty of teaching. 
As the oue is given with the presupposition that the university pro- 
fessor is a scientific investigator, so is the other coupled with the demand 
that the student be trained to independent. scientific thought. Like 
the liberty to teach, the liberty to learn is in German universities 
almost absolute. The student chooses his own university and his 
science, his teachers, and his course of study. It depends upon himself 
what lectures he will hear, what work he will perform; there is no 
official influence, scarcely advice is offered: he may prefer to hear 
nothing, and not to work at all. 
The fact that not a few prefer, at least for a time, to do nothing, has 
urged anxious fathers and apprehensive governments to propose the 
question whether academic liberty had not better be limited. Again 
and again such old worn-out devices for the promotion of diligence, as 
obligatory courses of study, with semiannual examinations, or annual 
intermediate examinations, or lists of attendance, controlled regularly, 
aud testimonials of diligence are suggested. 
He who is familiar with the conditions of German universities, and 
knows youth, will not doubt that all such attempts to aid diligence in 
study by means of gentle force avill be futile and disastrous; futile, 
because one can only force the semblance of, not actual diligence; dis- 
astrous, because such means would only weaken the spirit of self- 
reliance and responsibility. 
A forced study presupposes the discipline of a school, and relations 
such as existed between teachers and pupils in the colleges of the Mid- 
dle Ages. Such school-like order and relations are impossible in 
German universities, owing to the traditional custom in vogue, and to 
the advanced age of the students.- It would be folly to seek teachers 
who could govern young men, between 20 and 25 years of age, with 
the forms and means of school discipline. Without such order all other 
means would be futile, not to speak of lists of attendance, and such 
things. Examinations at stated intervals would not be reliable aids 
in inducing the students to work, and for scientific work they would 
prove ahindrance. At best the examinations would force the students 
to learn by heart some lecture-notes, or text-books, or the students 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 315 
would coach themselves by means of question books that would quickly 
be published to meet the demand. Every such examination brings 
forth suitable means for evading the difficulties it offers. 
This scanty positive result would be overbalanced by the negative 
effects. First, the relation between student and academic teacher 
would be disturbed. At present it is wholly based upon freedom and* 
confidence, and is therefore a most delightful one. Every attempt to 
increase the attendance upon the lectures by other means than are found 
in their own attraction, would seriously endanger the present relation. 
Who could endure to stand before an audience to whom he could not 
say at any time: He who does not find it profitable to attend to my 
words, will please remember that he is not obliged to come? And then, 
too, the relation to science would be disturbed: She will be sought and 
wooed as a free-born by the free; if she were forced upon the students 
she would become an object of loathing and hatred, not only to those 
who now avoid her, but also by those who love her fondly. 
He to whom his own knowledge of human nature dves not tell all 
_this, may learn it through the experience that has been always and 
everywhere the result of such measures. It is instructive to read what 
a gentleman wellacquainted with Russian circumstances says, (Reform, 
of Russian Universities, Law of 1884, Leipzig, 1886.) There are offi- 
cial courses of study for each year, attendance is obligatory, examina- 
tions are held and testimonials given. And the result? 
Everywhere is heard the complaint, that as early as the middle of November the 
lecture halls are nearly deserted. It is well, if after New Year till the close of 
February a little increase is noticeable in the attendance; but after that the prepa- 
ration for the coming examination prevents all further attendance upon lectures. 
* * * -Mnch importance is given to ‘“lithographed lectures;” they are bought at 
high prices, and enjoy official acknowledgment. The professor revises the copies 
or stenograms of his lectures first, before he questions the students in examination 
on the contents of these copies. (P. 99.) 
About the manner in which these examinations are conducted the 
same source offers some curious information. Observations made by 
Fr. Nicolai more than a hundred years ago, in the Vienna University, 
can be read in the description of his travels (see Vol. rv, p. 57). 
He found in the philosophic lecture room about two hundred hearers; 
the lecture was good, interesting, and comprehensible, but the students 
conducted themselves like boys: : 
Some lay on their backs on benches, others conversed, some looked about like 
children, and still others nodded in gentle sleep. All that is allowable, but in order 
to prevent these “lovers of wisdom” from becoming boisterous and disturbing the 
professor, an older student, the “fiscus philosophie,” is placed near the cathedra, 
He rises when occasion demands and reminds the students that they owe respect 
to their teacher. 
We may also refe? to a parallel which J. M. Hart, in his book on 
“German Universities,” draws between the relation of the German pro- 
fessor to his hearers and that of the American professor to his pupils. 
The contrasting feature in the life of a professor in America, namely, the obliga-  
-P-A-G-E-344
  816 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
tion to maintain discipline and perform police duty, is wholly wanting in Germany. 
The German professor reads only for such as are willing and capable of hearing him. 
His relation to his hearers is that of one gentleman speaking to others. He is not in 
constant dread of being called nicknames, or seeing caricatures of his face; his nightly 
repose is not disturbed by serenades. 
Certainly these things would be found with us also, if we ingroddugee 
“the causes that engender them, viz, school discipline and police super- 
vision. 
But even if these effects failed to appear, if it should, come to pass 
that all the students were changed into willing pupils who do their 
lessons diligently, this result would be far from the ideal; on the con- 
trary, it would be synonymous with the destruction of the idea of the 
German university. To form young men to be independent men, 
independent in thought and will, and conscious of their own responsi- 
bility, that is the idea of the German university as it has developed 
during the last two centuries. To make use of liberty, to advise and 
govern one’s self, can only be learned in liberty. It is true, this is a 
dangerous school, but there is no other. Many lose their way, yes, 
most of them, for a shorter or a longer period, wander about without 
guidance, before they find the right thing and that which suits them 
best. 
But he who has not erved on his own account, and not found his 
way by his own vigor of mind, can not be said to have made important 
experiences. He who travels through a country on a straight road, can 
not see much of it;-on round-about paths and occasional misleading 
roads, one learns to know the country; they oblige one to observe 
sharply, to look in every direction, and to notice land marks in order 
to find the right way. It is just soin the sciences. He who travels on 
the straight road of school exercises and acknowledged truths, he who 
has not the courage to deviate and to err, may be said not to have seen 
much in the land of truth. And to err long means to remain young 
long; only he who is finished, does not err any more. He who has 
learned from experiences to err, to seek, and to find, will be a much 
better helper and guide for other erring strugglers. And even such 
errors as lie on the side of volition are not without beneficial fruit for 
him who finds his way back by his own might. Man matures in the 
battles which the will fights with the inclinations to secure its liberty 
and sovereignty. “One must risk the boys in order to gain men.” 
This word of Rousseau still holds good. Upon this principle the 
German university is based. And that is the very thing for which the 
man of ripe age feels grateful. The university did not take him by 
the hand, guide him like a schoolboy, and guard him from errors of all 
kinds; no, it made him find his own way; but it awakened powers that 
made it possible for him to trace his steps aright, and to take heed for 
himself. It is not the teachers alone (it is lucky for the student if, here 
and there, he meets a teacher who throws a little light upon his path), 
but the entire university with its institutions, regulations, its traditions
-P-A-G-E-345

and associations that make a man of him; every thing calls upon him 
to exert his own will, to be a man, and stand up for himself. 
Once more H. von Sybel may be quoted. He says: 
We can not estimate too highly the gain derived from the fact that our universities 
in their innermost character, have the tendency to liberate the spirit of the man. 
In the preparatory school authority necessarily governed the whole man; in subse- 
quent life the practical profession does so, and with it exterior authority claims a 
considerable portion of existence. But upon German soil every educated man shall 
have one moment in his life in which the organs of authority, in which nation, state, 
and teacher, proclaim to him as the highest of all commands: Be thou intellectually 
free. 
Since we have arrived at the essential point in the character of the 
German university, the opinion of another classic witness may here 
find a place. Schleiermacher says in his Occasional Thoughts (p. 110): 
It is not the real purpose of the university to make its students learn, but to offer 
to the young imen an entirely new life, to awaken in them a higher and truly scien- 
tific spirit. But that can never be done by means of compulsion; only in the atmos- 
phere of absolute freedom of the mind is this possible, especially among Germans. 
As man can be made subject to the laws of love and faith only through love and 
faith (presuming that he is open to both) and not through force and compulsory 
exterior exercises, so he can be brought to approach knowledge and science that free 
him from the service of authority, only through knowledge, and through nothing 
else. We Germans especially, we sworn lovers of freedom in general, as well as of 
the individuality of every person, we who have never thought much of a general or 
normal form of science and belief, nor of an exclusive, infallible method for all to 
reach science and belief, how else can we but presuppose that this higher spirit of 
cognition must break forth in each person in his own way? How else can we but 
presuppose, and prove by our institutions, that this process cay, pot be conducted in 
a mechanical way, but must bear the character of freedom in all its parts? There- 
fore we can not treat all that belongs to itother than very tenderly. 
The appliances for study and their wse.—Form and importance of 
the instruction offered in the university has been treated on previous 
pages. It is the business of the student to make good use of the in- 
struction. During the first few semesters it will chiefly be his object 
to be admitted by some well-chosen lectures to the field upon which he 
is to work. Tradition suggests his writing out the lectures from notes 
taken; if it is done with circumspection, it is an exercise not to be 
despised. It necessitates him to follow the speaker with constant 
reflection, to shape anew the essential contents in abbreviated form. 
Gneist calls attention to the fact, in his Aphorisms Concerning Reform 
of Legal Education (1887), that it isa good preparation for the lawyer 
for his subsequent work to follow oral transactions, and by jotting 
down the main points to enable himself to recall the entire course of 
the proceedings. Similar occasions present themselves to everyone, 
not to the lawyers only; speech and oral proceedings begin to become 
more prominent with the ever increasing publicity of our modern life, 
side by side with reading and writing. Hence, written reports have 
their value if they are not merely done with the hand, to which the art 
of shorthand writing offers temptation. If the lecture is of interest, 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
    318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. | 
the notes taken will have their practical value for home repetition and 
thorough review. 
During the next following semesters, the so-called university exer- 
cises accompany the lectures. In them it is the object to learn the 
method of investigation or treatment of related problems. It may be 
supposed chat nowadays, at least in the philosophical faculty, all dili- 
gent and eager students participate in one way or another in the 
exercises that are offered either in public seminaries or in private 
societies and courses. Indeed, the active work offered here is a neces- 
Sary complement of the more receptive mental activity during the 
lecture. The transmission of scientific working methods now takes 
place almost exclusively in these institutions. These seminaries and 
conferences, as they may be called, are the best means for making per- 
sonal acquaintance between teachers and students possible. Wherever 
a really intimate relation is formed between them, it has, as a rule, its 
roots in seminary exercises, in the course of which the student enjoys 
individual, personal attention and care; here it is that the teacher 
sees the growth of talents that in future will continue his labors. 
A second very important means of study in the university is read- 
ing. It is essential that the student should read the most important 
authors in the chief branches of his chosen science, and that he learn 
to know them by thorough study. The lecture gives him, at first, a 
general view, then, by skillful use and thorough study of a text-book 
on the same subject, he succeeds in a better control of technical terms, 
aud in supplementing facts. It is also advisable to use extensive 
reference works occasionally. Even their bare acquaintance is a positive 
gain; in later life, especially in remote localities, they are not readily 
accessible. Then it will be important for the student to make himself 
familiar with the history of the science, at leastin outline. The lectures 
being directed more toward the systematic part ate supplemented, as a 
rule, by reference to literature; this is especially true with natural 
sciences. Occupying one’s mind with the history of a science, however, 
will be fruitful only if it leads the student to study a few of the histor- 
ically important works, to conduct in person a few of the classic inves- 
tigations, and not merely learn them from the reports of others. If 
literary monuments are the chief material of investigation, that is, in 
the philologic and historic sciences, the task of becoming familiar with 
them by careful reading and comparison is imperative. Thus, for in- 
stance, the theologian and philologist will find that the perusal of the 
writings which form the chief object of his science comprise the most 
important part of this work. He becomes freer and securer in propor- 
tion to the mastery he gains over the real substance of his science. He 
who knows the subjects themselves will easily find his way through their 
bibliography, codices, and editions, problems and commentaries, and 
he will go through these only as far as is desirable and necessary. 
This study of his own science is then supplemented, as opportunity
-P-A-G-E-347
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 319) 
and inclination allow, by reading works on related subjects and matter 
suitable to promote general culture. In this connection philosophy will 
claim its right of being noticed. According to the ancient truism “AIL 
roads lead to Rome,” and so in science all roads lead to philosophy. 
All investigation ends in those general problems the solution of which 
has always been assigned to philosophy. 
With regard to the method of reading, the old advice to read with 
pen or pencil in hand will forever hold good. By noticing the course 
of ideas, by emphasizing essentials, the attention is kept alive, and 
ideas and facts are impressed upor the mind. For the purpose of sub 
sequent remembrance a few notes made personally during the first lee- 
tures are of greater value than a minute or exact report by others. 
Reading is most fruitful when it is guided by certain points of view, 
historical or other. Around these points the actual profit accumulates. 
It may be remarked that recently much has been done to make the 
literary resources of German universities more accessible than formerly. 
The public libraries have come to meet the demands of the students by 
placing in immediate reach a rich collection of reference books for free 
use in the reading room, so that every attendant may without much for- 
mality at any time consult the most important text-books and works of 
reference. Also the well-stocked seminary libraries are open for use in 
the university buildings, the books of which may be loaned and taken 
home by the members of the seminary. It is devoutly to be hoped that 
the very extensive provision for literary treasures in libraries by means 
of public funds will not have the effect of increasing the customary 
economy of students in procuring their own collection of books. A 
small home library is, after all, an indispensable possession for anyone 
who works scientifically. 
Lastly, I may touch upon the advantages of working in company with 
others. It may be done in two ways—either by individuals working 
together privately, or by organized work in scientific societies. Both 
ways can be very successful. When two or three who are agreeable to 
each other and complement one another come together, for the purpose 
of reading or review, the work progresses well amid cheerfulness. The 
contemplation of a subject from two points of view and the opportunity 
to express one’s views and opinions offhand increase the interest, 
facilitate and deepen the comprehension. Also scientific societies as 
they have recently formed in great numbers have an importance that 
can not be underrated; partly because they bring together men of sim- 
ilar aspirations and give them opportunities to get acquainted with 
each other. In good and well-conducted societies something of histor- 
ical tradition is formed that infuses the newcomer with good spirit, 
guides him into right ways, and encourages him to high aspirations. 
The opportunity to lay before the circle of fellow students the results 
of little investigations or essays, reviews, and communications proves 
to be a desirable supplement to seminary exercises.

  320 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Examinations.—Everywhere in German universities there are two 
kinds of examinations—academic and state examinations. The former 
are held by the faculties, and through them academic degrees are 
obtained. The state examinations are held by boards of examination 
which are appointed by the government, mostly for one year. These 
boards receive instructions as to the manner of conducting these exam- 
inations. To pass a state examination is a conditio sine qua non for 
entering the learned professions. Academic examinations and degrees 
haye practical significance only’ for the university career, since they 
are necessary for gaining admission as private professors; otherwise 
they have the significance of a recommendation, or an ornament, only. 
The general adoption of the system of state examinations dates from 
the beginning of the nineteenth century. Its beginnings date back 
to the eighteenth century. For the medical profession the academic 
examinations and degrees were sufficient. For governmental offices 
entrance to the professions was conditioned, as arule, by academic 
testimonials (either by official proofs of having acquired a degree, or 
at least having attended a university, or by private testimonials of 
distinguished professors), and by temporary employment in a govern- 
mental office, or a court as auscultator. If he proved his efficiency, 
and after a few extra tests satisfactory to his superiors, a definite 
appointment was sure to follow. The oldest examinations were those 
for clerical offices; they were conducted by ecclesiastical authorities. 
For the profession of teaching, special examinations for candidates 
were separated from the theological examinations not before the begin- 
ning of the nineteenth century, in Prussia since 1810, The develop- 
ment of the system of state examinations is in closest connection with 
the entire historical development of the state. The new order of the . 
German states adopted at the beginning of the nineteenth century, 
that is, since the clash with revolutionary France, necessitated a new 
order for appointing officers. The old system of inherited claims to 
the higher positions in military and civil service, was done away with; 
in place of distributing the offices according to the judgment, favor, 
and inclination of the crown and private patrons, a new principle was 
adopted—that of selecting from the applicants those who passed pre- 
scribed examinations. From this the principle of promotion according 
to length of service followed logically. 
With the general adoption of this system two results have been 
accomplished. (1) It gives to the state a certain security that the 
offices will not fall into the hands of applicants wholly or insufficiently 
prepared. (2) It gives to him who prepares himself for any career, or 
who enters it with the proofs of his capacity, a certain security that no 
one without merit can be preferred to him merely through personal 
favoritism. 
This is the essential significance of the examinations. He who pre- 
fers this system to that of patronage and privileges must also want
-P-A-G-E-349
        GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 321 
the examinations, however little of an infallible means they may be for 
recognizing capacity and merit, and however much of discomfort and 
disturbance they may cause, both for examiners and examinees. Above 
all, the freedom of scientific study suffers from them most. Every exam- 
ination which is not a purely pedagogical act between teachers and 
pupils, every state examination which has the object of ascertaining 
the amount of knowledge by examiners not acquainted with the appli- 
cants, will necessarily lead to reviewing compendiums and memorizing 
text books. In the nature of the case, such an examination is directed 
toward externals—that is, things that can be stated in a few words— 
and not so much toward internals and the essence of a science. The. 
real intellectual product of scientific occupation can never be of much 
account in such an examination, as the sharp-sighted Englishman, 
Latham, in his excellent book proved, “On the action of examination 
considered as a means of selection” (1877). This fact becomes very 
prominent when the examination is conducted partly, or entirely, by 
men who do not take active part in teaching. This has been the case 
in Prussia in examinations for entering the legal profession, but recently 
the university teachers have found a better representation in the boards 
of examiners. 
V.—THE UNITY OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
It is a conviction generally shared that the preservation of the uni- 
fied university is a happy dispensation in our national history. This 
concluding chapter may show what gain for science and the life of the 
nation is derived from it. 
_ The most obvious gain is, that a unified university is superior in 
influence and reputation to the separated faculties. The French fac- 
ultés have felt this; a detached faculty of law or medicine is barely 
known, while small German universities, like Jena, Kiel, Erlangen, 
have a world-wide reputation. In Erlangen it is the theological, in 
Kiel the medical, in Jena the philosophical faculty which gives luster 
and reputation to the whole corporation. This is not without impor- 
tance for each individual member of a university. As a professor of 
the university of Jena or Erlangen, a scholar is everywhere known, and 
all doors are open to him, while a member of an obscure detached fac- 
ulty disappears from public view. For students, too, the term univer- 
sity has a better sound. That, for instance, Paris could gain such a 
preponderance over the other facultés that it alone enrolls one-half of 
all the students of France, is owing to the fact that there are no uni- 
versities in the provinces. For this very reason efforts are being made 
recently to consolidate the professional schools into unified universities. 
A more important consideration is that which pertains to the inter- 
nal importance of the question. The unified university represents the 
unity of science in its organization, and thus makes it obvious to all 
its members. Since it constantly suggests to every member to seek 
ED 92——21
-P-A-G-E-350
  322 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
aid among the others, it leads the representatives of the most varied 
sciences to intimate reciprocal action. The professors meet daily 
within and outside of the university buildings. The theologian meets 
the physiologist, philologist, historian, and physicist; and because these 
sciences present themselves to him personified, as it were, he can not 
possibly pass them by. He feels impelled to make terms with them in 
his mind, as he does socially. Doubtless, the character of Protestant 
theology is in close relation to this, for to reconcile science and religion 
is its chief tendency; especially is it the task of dogmatics to construct 
a bridge between scientific consciousness and the religious needs of the 
times. Catholic theology originates chiefly in the exclusive seminaries, 
and where it exists in universities it maintains a certain exclusiveness ; 
hence there is more unity in its teaching, but also less power to influ- 
ence science and the culture of the times. Protestant theology being 
reinforced by all the sciences, has a refiex effect upon them; consider, 
for instance, such men as Schleiermacher, Baur, Hase. For the German 
universities it is not an insignificant source of impulse that most of 
them have a Protestant theological faculty in their midst. Estrange- 
ment of scientific thought from religion, as it is often found in Catholie 
countries, the universities of which have no theological faculties, is not 
possible in the Protestant world. Compare the French civilization with 
the German; the former is irreligious, the latter on the whole is a 
religious movement. Wolff and Kant are both, in a certain sense, 
reformers of theology; and Fichte, Schelling, Hegel are such even to a 
greater degree. 
A similar effect is noticed in the other sciences. The philosopher 
comes together daily with investigators of nature and history; influ- 
ences work hither and thither. He constantly receives from them im- : 
pulses to bring his thoughts into contact with concrete reality; the 
whole modern development of philosophy in Germany shows this. On 
the other hand, he awakens and enlivensin the investigator the desire 
to find general truth and ultimate aims. The inclination of German 
science toward philosophy may be the result of constant personal 
contact of philosophers and theologians. Likewise the jurist meets 
daily the historian, the political economist, the physician and the 
physicist, the chemist and the biologist. The mere existence of the 
others is an appeal to him to seek relations beyond the limits of his own 
field of study. The friendship that united vy. Savigny and Jacob 
Grimm, the founder of the school of historic right and the founder of 
the school of Germanistic research, may be considered a symbol of the 
unity of the legal and the historic investigation in Germany. 
A similiar unity exists between medicine and natural science. We 
may also call attention in this connection to the ease with which 
students turn from one science to another—frequently the limits of a 
faculty are passed over. Lotze, the philosopher, was a physician and 
professor of medicine in Leipzig, before he was called to Géttingen as 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 323 
professor of philosophy. Wundt also started with the study of medicine. 
Fechner was a professor of physies all his life. Helmholtz, the phys- 
icist and physiologist, had completed his medical studies and was army 
surgeon before he became professor of physiology, and afterward of 
physics. Mommsen, the historian, was originally professor of law before 
he became professor of history. Zeller, the historian of philosophy, 
was a theologian, and for along time professor of theology, before he 
turned to the philosophic faculty. All these men and many others have 
laid the foundation to this double nature while they were still students. 
And this leads over to the other point. As social communion is of 
the greatest importance for the faculties, so it is for the student. It is 
true the university has not the unity of a school, for it is really a com- 
bination of independent institutions, the courses of which are essen- 
tially laid side by side. Nevertheless, a frequent reaching over from 
one faculty to another takes place. There is scarcely a student ina 
German university who has not attended one course of lectures outside 
of his own faculty, or at least attended occasional lectures there. Of 
all the faculties, it is the philosophic which proves to be the most gen- 
eral. Inthe lectures of the philosopher, the historian, the scientist, the 
political economist, the student of all the faculties meet; most fre- 
quently are the students of theology seen there, for of them it may be 
. said that they have the most universal desire for culture. The students 
of law and medicine are not so often found in the philosophical faculty, - 
but frequently enough to make an absolute nonattendance a rare 
exception. The contrary case is found also. Members of the philo- 
sophie faculty attend, according to inclination and the nature of their 
study, courses of literature in other faculties. The student of history 
hears lectures on law and church history; the student of natural 
sciences hears lectures on medicine, etc. Undoubtedly this facilitates 
the passing from one faculty into another—that is, the change from one. 
profession to another which takes place frequen‘ly. The unity of the 
university makes it possible to recognize and correct betimes errors in 
the selection of the studies and profession, since it invites all its stu- 
dents to survey the ground in the whole realm of science. 
This reciprocity in the lecture courses is supplemented by another 
important fact, the social and scientific intercourse of the students 
themselves. There is scarcely a student who is not in more or less 
lively intercourse with the members of other faculties. In this regard 
the students’ clubs are very beneficial; here lawyers and: philologists, 
theologians and medical students, learn to know each other intimately. 
Many a friendship that Jasts for a lifetime is eemented here. This is 
not a trifling consideration. He who has lived in personal friendship 
with a single member of another profession in the university enters 
into relation to the entire profession; the basis of mutual comprehension 
and confidenceis given. ‘Ars non habetosorem, nisiignorantem.” The 
unity of university culture contributes to a great degree toward creat-
-P-A-G-E-352
    324 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
ing in all who have academic culture a feeling of unity and solidarity, 
a feeling of aristocracy of the mind, destined to counterbalance the 
aristocracy of birth and money. Since it excludes no one who has the 
capacity to rise to the level of the academic world, it reestablishes, as 
the clergy did formerly, the unity and spiritual leadership of the nation. 
To do honor to truth it must be stated, however, that the ancient 
“universitas” is recently exposed to the danger of disintegration more 
than before. Not that the outer bond is in danger of being loosened, 
butits inner relations seem to lose their strength. Itis the progressing 
division of labor, and the tendency to specialization arising therefrom, 
which threatens the unity of the institution. The students and profes- 
sors of medicine have loosened their connection with the university 
proper more than those of the other faculties. This is owing to unavoid- 
able circumstances, namely, the independence and remote location of 
their institutes, such as clinics and hospitals. The study of medicine 
takes hold of the neweomer more decisively and exclusively than any 
other faculty. The students of theology and law remain more closely 
attached to the university. On the other hand, the tendency spoken of 
is found active in the philosophic faculty also. In the nature of the case 
this faculty intends to represent the unity of the sciences. Construing it 
purely theoretically, one might lodge in it all that is really scientific in 
the higher faculties, for it either belongs, like religion and law, to the 
- real of historical research, or like natural phenomena, to the field of 
scientific investigation. Upon this is based the ancient connection of 
the higher faculties with the philosophic—that is to say, we presuppose 
the philosophic faculty to be the general basis of the higher faculties, 
the latter having branched off and assumed the character of technical 
or professional institutions. 
But in proportion as the sciences within the philosophic faculty 
branch off and specialize, in proportion as these branches develop into 
technical or professional schools, in the same proportion the faculty 
loses the capacity to serve general purposes. Since the lectures on 
philosophy and mathematics have assumed the character of a profes- 
sional institution for specialists, they are not as numerously attended 
by students of theology and medicine. And in the lectures on natural 
science and history a similar change, with its consequences, is notice- 
able. The philosophic lectures, pure and simple, are about the only 
ones which are generally attended. ; 
However, the division of labor can not be undone, for upon it depends 
the enormous progress of scientific investigation in modern times. It 
must become the object of all who understand the danger, to combat 
the spirit of specialism, of self-limitation, and narrow-minded self-suffi- 
ciency; to aid in this endeavor every member of the university is called 
upon. The view of that which is general, a philosophic sense which is 
ever ready to place the particular at the service of the highest intelli- 
gence, should forever find a home in the philosophic faculty. This
-P-A-G-E-353
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. . 325 
would be a noble object of the public lectures, in which, to a large 
audience of members of related branches of science, the results and 
problems of separate sciences might be treated, so far as they are found 
to be of general interest. The official managers also might, to a certain 
degree, aid in checking the tendency to excessive specialization, both 
among the professors and students. An excessive number of chairs 
for one science will naturally promote a division of the matter to be 
taught, and thus threaten the aims of higher education. On the other 
hand, the character of higher study might be influenced advanta- 
geously, both by the order of examination and the composition of the 
examination board. 
In conclusion we shall touch upon another point: The unity of all 
universities of the German tongue. The totality of the German uni- 
versities forms a world of its own, exclusive toward the outside world 
and closely linked together. A constant exchange of students as well 
as professors runs through it, as the life-giving current of blood does 
through the body. This peculiarity is not found in foreign universities, 
notably not in those of the English type. As the students remain in 
their colleges, so the graduates remain with their university; at least, 
the institution preferably recruits its faculty from its own graduates, 
ceteris paribus. In Germany this is not at all the case, so that one is 
tempted to speak of a prevalent inclination to procure new professors- 
from outside. Every university tries to draw into its folds the best- 
men wherever it can find and induce them to come, and it does that in 
order to increase its own power of attraction. The territorial division 
of Germany into many states of varying size is, undoubtedly, one of 
the causes of this system. There has ever been, and is now, a noble 
rivalry between the various German governments to elevate their uni- 
versities, and to keep them on a high level of excellence without regard 
to the place of birth of the applicants for professors’ chairs. It can not 
be doubted for a moment that this system is superior to the system of 
favoring home talent. Though the change at times may be a little too 
abrupt, yet on the whole, it has great advantages that every university 
takes part in the life of the union, and is ever supplied with new blood 
and new thoughts. 
At the close of this essay it need scarcely be offered as an excuse that 
I have attempted chiefly to show the great underlying ideas of the 
German university system, and hence lightly passed over deficiencies 
and the shady sides of the picture, such as are not wanting in any 
human institution. People nowadays prefer to dwell upon these, think- 
ing that they represent the reality, whereas such persons, perhaps 
unknowingly, lose sight of the essential features as they have been rep- 
resented in the foregoing pages. The underlying idea is also a piece 
of reality, and so long as this reality is alive, the most important and 
most significant portion of reality, its animating spirit, will be found 
active.

A word of Savigny may express what the German nation possesses 
in its universities. In an essay, quoted before, he says: 
That which constitutes their value is not the perfect scientific scholarliness of 
their teachers, nor the growing scholarliness of their students. If we were to claim 
that, we should be holding before ourselves a mirror that would shame us. But it 
is the fact that in our universities we have a form in which every distinguished talent 
among the professors finds a chance for development; in which every strong pre- 
disposition among the students finds satisfaction; a form by means of which every 
progress in science easily finds introduction; a form by means of which it is easy to 
recognize a man of talent who seems destined for a higher vocation, and by means 
of which in the poorer life of more circumscribed talents a feeling of higher exist- 
ence is awakened. Upon the possession of such a form we have reason to be proud, 
and he who knows our universities, will agree with me that this praise expresses 
literal truth, and is no exaggeration.

1874.

B.—History. 
A complete historical presentation is not yet in existence, for the work of Meiners, 
Geschichte der Entstehung und Entwicklung der hohen Schulen unseres Erdtheils 
(4 vols. 1802) can not be considered complete. Some fragments of the history of 
German universities are found in the fourth volume of Karl v. Raumer’s History of 
Pedagogy. A true history has only become possible since extensive publications 
from the archives have made the material accessible and since the publications of the 
chronicles of individual universities have prepared the way for a comprehensive his- 
torical presentation. Suchawork is contemplated by G. Kaufmann. Thus far only 
the first volume has been issued, which treats of non-German universities: Ges- 
chichte der deutschen Uniyersitiiten, Bd. 1, 1888. Something of the history of instruc- 
tion, especially that of the philosophic faculties, is found in Fr. Paulsen’s Geschichte 
des gelehrten Unterrichts auf den deutschen Schulen und Universitiiten, 1885. 
L. v. Stein, Das Bildungswesen des Mittelalters (1883); Die Zeit bis zum 19. 
Jahrhundert (1886), offers chiefly a review of the history of the state’s management 
of education in the different countries of Europe. 
Among the presentations which, in regard to time and extent, treat certain limited 
fields of the subject, we mention: 
H. Denifle. Die Entstehung der Universitiiten des Mittelalters bis 1400. 1885. Vol. 
1.of a work on the universities of the Middle Ages.

STATISTICAL REVIEW OF THE GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 
(Written for the World's Columbian Exposition by Prof. J. Conrad. Halle.] 
1. GENERAL REVIEW. 
Germany has at present twenty complete universities, one royal 
academy at Miinster with only two faculties, and the Lyceum Hosianum 
at Braunsberg, which has the character of a Catholic school of theology.

GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 329 
Of the universities only Bonn and Berlin have their origin in this cen- 
tury, while the foundation of the others date back to former centuries; 
some, like Heidelberg, are 500 years old. 
The total attendance at German universities is at present about 28,000, 
or about 57 students to every 100,000 inhabitants. This number is not 
easily compared with that of other countries, since other requirements 
for admission are in vogue there, hence the composition of the mass of 
university frequenters not being alike, a numerical comparison is obvi- 
ously unfair. Especially the theologic faculty causes a disturbing ele- 
ment in statistical comparison, since in some countries it is separated 
from the university, or supplied by independent seminaries quite dif- 
ferent in organization and management. 
Sweden had at the close of the eighth decade about 63 students, 
Norway 85 to every 100,000 inhabitants, Holland 51, Switzerland 63, 
of which 5:2 were women. Hence several coun‘ries show a greater 
number of students than Germany, a fact that may be owing to the 
greater length of the course. Leaving the theological students out of 
consideration, we find in the countries we are especially interested in, the 
following average numbers for the years 1886-1889. To every 100,000 
inhabitants— ‘ 
Germany had 48 students. Switzerland had 50:4 men students. 
Austria had 55-9 students. Switzerland had 5-2 women students. 
Italy had 51°3 students. : Denmark had 47-1 students. 
France had 42-6 students. Norway had 76:6 students. 
Belgium had 82°3 students. Sweden had 57:3 students. 
Holland had 45-4 students. Russia had 9-9 students.     
  From this list it is obvious that the number of students in Germany, 
compared with that of other leading countries, is by no means very large. 
Naturally the attendance has varied considerably in the course of 
time. As early as the beginning of the thirties we find more than 52 
students in every 100,000 inhabitants, a number that considerably 
exceeded the demand. This number decreased in the following decades 
to 33, but rose again during the eighties, until it reached 63, the high- 
est point ever reached; since then it has decreased again. At the end 
of the third decade the universities enrolled 11,500 students, at the 
close of the sixth decade the number was 13,000, and in the summer 
semester of 1890 it was 29,382. Especially from the beginning of the 
seventh decade a very rapid increase took place. These fluctuations 
may be explained by the economical circumstances of the times. A 
phenomenal progress in the general activity of the nation attracts talent 
with magical power towards industrial pursuits; economical depression, 
on the other hand, invites youth more toward the secure career of civil 
officers. During a depression all professions turn towards academic 
culture. During the fifth and sixth decade, the extremely low salaries 
paid to all categories of civil officers deterred many from professional 
study, while in later years the general improvement in the payment of 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
  330 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
salaries has had the contrary effect. The distribution of the students 
in the various universities shows great differences. The great univer- 
sities (Berlin, Munich, and Leipsic, representing the three states Prus- 
sia, Bavaria, and Saxony) during the last three semesters attracted 
5,000, 3,400, and 3,260, or, together, 11,660, that is, 41 percentof allthe 
students, while during the first few decades of our statistical exposé 
they enrolled only 31 to 36 per cent. 
It is plain that the concentration in chief centers of commerce in 
large cities has made great progress. The small universities also have 
shown a perceptible increase. The smallest German university, Ros- 
tock, has 390 students; this institution had barely 100 students 
during the thirties and forties. Kénigsberg, Kiel, Jena, Giessen, with 
500 to 700 students, may be still counted among the smaller, the others 
among the middle-sized universities. In the smaller universities, as 
experience shows, the younger students are chiefly represented, while 
the older ones prefer the larger universities, and in middle-sized univer- 
sities both freshmen and seniors are found. However, each university 
exhibits varieties that have their cause in its peculiar features.

  336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
2. THE DIFFERENT FACULTIES. 
The German universities had, during the last few semesters, 3,850 
students of Protestant theology, which is equal to 12:3 to every 100,000 
Protestantinhabitants. This number far exceeds the demand, although 
not many years ago the number had risen to 4,500, or almost 15 to 
every 100,000 Protestants. This high tide did not begin until the 
eighth decade, while during the seventh the number of such students 
was between 1,700 and 1,900, which number was insufficient to fill all 
the vacant pulpits. 
The number of students of Catholic theology falls short considerably 
of that of the Protestants, both in absolute and relative numbers. 
There were only 1,300, or 7-4 to every 100,000 Catholics, during the last 
few semesters. During the last years an increase is noticed, but it 
is not quite sufficient at present to meet the demand. At the close of 
the seventies, at the time of the “Culturkampf” in Prussia, the num- 
ber had decreased to 700, or 4:2 to every 100,000 Catholics, while as 
early as the fifties, and still earlier, in the thirties, the number had 
been more than 1,300, or between 9:3 and 10 to every 100,000 Cath- 
olics. . . 
The chief centers of Protestant theology are Berlin and Halle with 
over 600 students each, Leipzig with 500, Tiibingen with 400, while 
Kiel, Heidelberg, Giessen, and Rostock have scarcely 100 each. 
' For Catholic theology Breslau and Bonn, Miinster, and Freiburg, 
with over 200 students each, are of special importance, while Brauns- 
berg has only 28. 
The number of law students was 6,850 during the last two semesters, 
or 13°8 to every 100,000 inhabitants, which is almost twice as large as 
circumstances demand. At the beginning of the seventh decade, there 
were only 4,000; between 185666 the average number was 2,800, a 
number which proved inadequate. 
The law students crowd into large cities, and this tendency has 
shown itself more prominently than in former years. Thus we find in 
Berlin, Munich, and Leipzig over 1,000 law students, and in the winter 
semester of 1891-92 as many as 1,557, or 52 per cent of all law 
students, inscribed in three universities. 
Greifswald, Kiel, and Rostock have considerably less than 100, 
while the other universities have between 100 and 350. The law 
faculty of some universities shows remarkable differences between the 
attendance in summer and winter. Berlin naturally has greater attrac- 
tion in winter than in summer; this explains why in winter the number 
of law students is greater by 400 than in summer. The southern Ger- 
man universities with beautiful surroundings, such as Tiibingen, Kiel, 
and Freiburg, double their number of law students in the summer. 
The inedical faculty also shows an extraordinarily strong attendance 
in late years, namely, 8,600 or 17-4 to every 100,000 inhabitants. Dur- 
ing the seventh decade, the number of students was scarcely half of 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 3387 
what it is now, namely, 3,600 or 8-4, while in the forties the Uae: did 
not reach 2,000 or 5:5. 
The greatest attraction for medical students Berlin seems to have 
with over 1,500 students during the last year. Munich -with 1,000, 
then follow Leipzig with 860 and Wiirzburg with 730; Rostock has the 
lowest number, 138; the other universities have between 170 and 370. 
The philosophic faculty which, for along time, was the best attended 
faculty in all German universities, has recently fallen somewhat behind 
the medical. It has now 7,400 students, or about 15 to every 100,000 
inhabitants. Since the beginning of the eighth decade, when it had an 
attendance of 9,000, or about 20 to every 100,000 inhabitants, it has 
gradually gone back, so that now it has reached a normal number. 
During the sixties this faculty numbered 4,500, from 1846~56 not 
quite 3,000 students, or about 8:8 to every 100,000 inhabitants. 
The rather mixed composition of the philosophic faculty makes it 
necessary to analyze it and to judge each group separately. It contains, 
first of all, the large group of students of philology and history, who 
numbered during the last year 2,800, or 37-8 per cent of all the students 
of the philosophic faculty. How remarkably this number has decreased 
“seen from the fact that in 1881 this group had 4,546 students, or about 
53 per cent. Then comes the second group, that of students of mathe- 
matics and natural sciences, which had 2,150 students during the last 
year, or 28°6 per cent. In this group the number has decreaséd less than 
in the first, for in 1881 it had 2,682, or about 31:30 per cent. Still the 
decrease is quite perceptible. The third group comprises the students 
of political science, agriculture, forestry, mining, etc., which group is 
not easily analyzed. The number of students in this group fluctuates 
frequently and therefore offers no measurement for comparison, many 
of these students finishing their studies in other special schools which, 
though on a par with universities, are not distinctively universities. 
Thus, for instance, the special schools of agriculture in Berlin and 
Hohenheim, the forestry schools at Eberswalde, Miinden, Tharandt, 
the mining academies at Freiberg and others, and the nine technical 
universities (polytechnica) for civil and mechanigal engineering. 
While many of the students of agriculture attend universities in north- 
ern Germany, especially Halle, the students of forestry attend those 
of southern Germany, Munich, Tiibingen, and Giessen. Students of 
political science also are found there more frequently because they 
find there a technical preparation for specific classes of civil offices, 
for which a thorough study of law is required-in northern Germany. 
The third group, then, taken together, comprises 1,013, or 13-4 per cent 
which number shows a considerable increase which is probably owing to 
the organic connection of some academies of agriculture and for- 
estry with universities, institutions which formerly had an independent 
existence. 
In the lists of students we now generally find another category: the 
ED 92——22 
 
-P-A-G-E-366
| 338 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
students of pharmacy and dentistry. That these two classes of stu- 
dents are thrown together, is owing to the fact that their admission to 
the university is not dependent upon graduation from a gymnasium. 
Where this-category was not specially mentioned, we went back of the 
summaries in order to complete our statistical analysis. Only for 
Tiibingen we failed to do so, since the official report of that institution 
omits to state to what profession each student devotes himself. This 
source of error, however, is quite insignificant. The number which is 
withdrawn from observation in Tiibingen, is replaced by 28 veterinary 
students in Giessen, the report of which enrolls them in the philosophic 
faculty. During the last two semesters 1,480 persons, or 20 per cent ° 
of the students of the philosophic faculty, belong to the group of stu- 
dents of pharmacy and dentistry. The greatest number is exhibited 
by Berlin, which has 276, Munich 258, Leipzig 186. By far the greatest 
number of them are students of pharmacy, only Berlin has the large 
number of 154 students of dentistry; Leipzig has only 36, Munich in 
the summer of 1892 only 3, Halle 7, Wiirzburg 8, Giessen 5. Altogether 
we count more than 330 students of dentistry in German universities, 
There are consequently about 1,150 students of pharmacy, while during 
the period of 1861~71 there were only 470, which shows that this 
number or students has increased nearly 300 per cent. 
3 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE FACULTIES. 
The relative strength of the faculties has changed very essentially 
in the course of time. At the beginning of this century, up to the fourth 
5 decade, theology played the most important part in German universi- 
ties, for it enrolled nearly one-half, later on, one-third, of all the students. 
But during the forties the percentage fell to one-fourth, and during the 
seventies it receded to 13 per cent; since then it has increased to 18 
per cent. In the Protestant theological faculty, the proportion of 16.8 
per cent gradually decreased to 10 per cent, at the end of the seventies. 
In later years it fluctuated between 13 and 15 per cent. The fluctua- 
tions in the Catholic theology are much greater. At the beginning of 
the thirties it absorbed 11 per cent of all the students; after various 
changes during the years 1876 to 1886, it sank to its lowest point, 3.4 
per cent, since then it has increased to 4.8 per ecnt. 
The law faculty fluctuated between 20 and 33 per cent, taking the 
average by decades. At present it absorbs a little less than one-fourth 
of all the students, which would seem a normal state of affairs. The 
medical faculty had, up to the year 1881, between 15 and 21 per cent, 
but since then it has increased remarkably, and now stands in the fore- 
ground with over 30 per cent. 
Students of the philosophic faculty, pure and proper, have been 
counted as such only during this century. Formerly they were absorbed 
by the other faculties, especially by that of theology, in which the teach- 
ers were being prepared, while the students of natural science completed  
-P-A-G-E-367
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 339 
their studies in the medical faculty. At the beginning of the thirties 
the philosophical faculty had already been consolidated so well that 18 
per cent of all the students were enrolled in it, and they were all stu- 
dents who were not enrolled in any other faculty. Up to the year 1861 
this proportion rose to 30 per cent, and up to 1881 to 41 per cent; in late 
years it has returned to a more normal state, and enrolls only 26-5 per 
cent, since both, the study of mathematics and natural science, as well 
as that of philology, have considerably decreased.

4. THE PREPARATION OF GERMAN STUDENTS. 
By far the greatest number of students have graduated from the gym- 
nasium, for only the graduate of a gymnasium has the unlimited right to 
be matriculated in all faculties, and after having attended the lectures, 
be admitted to the state examinations that open the way to the learned 
professions in so far as they are, directly or indirectly, connected with 
official duties. Only in the philosophic faculty an exception from the 
requirement mentioned is made. Here the graduates of other high 
schools, with a nine years’ course, are on equal footing in certain 
branches of science, and as “bona fide” students they are admitted to 
the examinations for academic degrees also. All others who aim at the 
acquisition of general culture only, or are preparing themselves for 
practical pursuits without claiming the right to state appointments, 
such as agriculturists, chemists, pharmacists, dentists, etc., are matric- 
ulated without having graduated from the gymnasium or real-gym- 
nasium. In Prussia such young men are admitted if they have acquired 
the right to the one-year voluntary service in the army. 
The statistics of Prussian universities give us very minute information 
concerning the number of graduates. Of the 10,825 German students 
who, on an average, studied during the six semesters from 1887-88 to 
1890 in Prussian universities, there were 85.2 per cent graduates of 
gymnasia, 6.7 per cent graduates of real-gymnasia, 8.1 per cent had not 
graduated. Hence in the total number these last two items are not yet 
of considerable importance. For the philosophic faculty, though, these 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
  340 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
small percentages are of vital importance, for it is in this faculty that 
they matriculate almost exclusively. Among the students of Protestant 
theology there was but one graduate of a real-gymnasium, and two had 
not graduated, probably because they were preparing for missionary 
service. Among the Catholic theologians there was but one graduate 
of areal-gymnasium. Among the students of law there were two, and 
one who had not graduated. Among the medical students 3 were 
graduates of a real-gymnasia, and 16 had not graduated. The philo- 
sophic faculty had on an average 1,816 German students, of whom only 
49.1 per cent were graduates of gymnasia; 23 per cent were graduates 
of real-gymnasia, chiefly students of modern philology, mathematics, 
and natural sciences; 27.9 per cent had not graduated, these were 
chiefly agriculturists, chemists, pharmacists, and dentists. 
From the other German universities outside of Prussia we have not 
such minute information. Only a few universities can be mentioned 
here. In the summer semester of 1892 Leipzig had 3,104 students, of 
whom 2,431 were graduates of German gymnasia, 119 graduates of 
real-gymnasia, and 320 Germans and 234 foreigners had been admitted 
without having graduated from such schools. Expressed on the scale 
of 100, and leaving the foreigners out of consideration, we find that 84.8 
per cent were graduates of gymnasia, 4.2 per cent of real-gymnasia, and 
11 per cent had not graduated. Of 612 German students in the philo- 
sophie faculty 320, or more than one-half had not graduated. In 
Giessen 425 of the 570 German students were graduates of gymnasia, 
96 graduates of real-gymnasia, 50 had not graduated—that is, less than 
one-fourth of the 216 members of the philosophic faculty. 
5. NATIONALITY OF THE FOREIGN STUDENTS. 
During the last two semesters there was an average of 1891 foreign- 
ers, or 6.7 per cent of all the students in German universities. This 
number has gradually increased, although it has somewhat fluctuated. 
In 1835-’36 there were only 475, or 4.02 per cent; in 1870-’71 there were 
753 or 6.1 per cent; in 1880-’81 the proportion was 5.16 per cent; at 
present it is 6.7 per cent. By far the greatest number of foreigners 
naturally flock to large cities. Berlin had 626 in winter of 1891-92, 
and 568 in summer of 1892; Munich had 18 in winter, 190 in summer; 
Leipzig 296 and 241—that is, together the three universities had on an 
average 1,052—or much more than one-half of all the foreigners.

If we compare the nationalities we find that the greatest number of 
students, namely, 415, or 22 per cent, comes from America, The number 
of Americans, coming almost exclusively from the United States, has 
increased extraordinarily during the last few years; within the last 10 
years it has been doubled, and during the last 30 years it has been 
quadrupled. After America comes Russia with 20.4 per cent; then 
Austria-Hungary with 13-7 per cent; then Switzerland with 13. per 
cent. Great Britain sends 7 per cent; Asia, especially Japan, is repre- 
sented with 4.3 per cent. 
The greatest number of foreigners are matriculated in the philosophic 
faculty ; it absorbs 52.7 per cent of all the foreigners; the medical faculty 
has 25 per cent, the law faculty 13 per cent, the theological 9.3 per cent. 
Of the 1,000 foreigners in the philosophic faculties, the greatest num- 
ber studied philology and history. Of the 308 foreigners in 189192 
matriculated in the philosophic faculty in Berlin, 203 studied phi- 
losophy and history, 66 mathematics and natural sciences, 20 agricul- 
ture and political science, 9 pharmacy and dentistry. Only in Halle 
a great number of the students of agriculture and political science 
are foreigners; in summer of 1892 there were 75 foreigners among the 
218 students of that class, and in the preceding winter there had been 
89 foreigners among 272 students. 7 
On an average 161 foreigners studied protestant theology during the 
last year—41 from Switzerland, 39 from Austria-Hungary, 36 from 
America. Only very recently have there been foreigners in the faculty 
of the Catholic theology; their number was. 16, of whom 9 came from 
Switzerland. Fully one-third of the foreign theologians attend Berlin; 
the other two-thirds are found in the other 21 universities. Halle had 
18, Tiibingen 4, Leipzig 11, Jena 15, ete.

  342 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Of the 250 foreign law-students 85, or one-third, came from Switzer- 
land, 32 from Austria-Hungary, 29 from Russia, 15 from Greece, 12 
a America, 11 sae eli Most of them attend the large centers. 
Berlin had 58, Leipzig 55, Munich 38, Heidelberg 37. 
From Table IV we see that the greatest number of foreign students 
of medicine came from America, or 122 among 469, while 100 came from 
Russia, 60 from Switzerland, 38 from Asia. Berlin attracted 138 of 
them, Munich 60, Leipzig 24, Wiirzburg 44, Heidelberg 26.

6. LENGTH OF THE UNIVERSITY COURSES. + 
The question, “ How long do the students attend the university ?” can 
not be answered with any degree of certainty. For those who after- 
ward enter the State service or pass the State examinations, it might 
be possible to determine it from official documents, but statistics on 
this point have never been compiled. Tor those who enter other walks 
of life we are entirely without reliable sources of information. Prus- 
sian official statistics offer indications with regard to the German stu-
-P-A-G-E-371
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 343 
dents in Prussian universities, by stating how many of the matricu- 
lated students of German descent are studying longer than is officially 
réquired as preparation for a certain profession. It is also stated how 
long those have studied who left the universities after completing their 
studies. Furthermore, it is stated how many semesters these students 
stayed longer than is officially prescribed for each profession. If this 
sum be divided by the number of students who finished the course 
we arrive at a tolerably correct average length of the course. Since, 
as we Shall see later on, the students frequently change their univer- 
sity, the quotient found is not expressing the exact length, for that 
ought to be considered a little shorter. We must also consider that 
a great number of students perform their year of voluntary army duty 
during their university career. Of course during this time attendance 
upon lectures ceases. Hence there is a further distinction to be made; 
that is, between those who enter the army and those who do not. We 
add, also, the absolute numbers in order to offer a chance for proper 
comparison. The results in the margin can not lay claim to absolute 
correctness, inasmuch as the numbers compared are too small for com- 
parison and calculation. 
During the four semesters from the winter of 1886-87 to the close of 
the summer of 1888, the following number of students completed their 
studies in Prussian universities:

  It is of some interest to state how much. the military service lengthens 
the course of study. It was found that the students of Protestant 
theology, who were not obliged to serve in the army, could complete 
their studies in 7-22 semesters, while those who did serve in the army 
required an average of 8:24 semesters. In the Catholic theologic facuryt 
the difference was very much greater; in the former case the duration 
was 9:77, in the latter 13-5 semesters. Military service lengthened the 
course of the law students about 1:5 semesters, while the course of the 
medical students was lengthened by not quite 1 semester. The philo- 
logists lost on an average 3 semesters; that is to say, they not only 
Jost the one year spent in serving under arms, but had to add another 
semester in order to regain what they had Jost during that time. 
From the foregoing numbers we conclude that on a general average
-P-A-G-E-372
  
  344 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
the duration of all university courses is actually extended longer than 
is officially required. The students of Protestant theology study 1:85 
semesters longer, the law students 1-17, the medical students 3-16, and 
the students of the philosophic faculty 3-5 semesters longer. These 
averages do not give a very minute picture of the circumstances; for a 
considerable number of students actually succeed in completing their 
studies in the prescribed time, while others extend it extremely, be it 
from idleness or want of means of subsistence, which requires them to 
spend much time in giving lessons, etc., or be it that they lose time in 
changing their profession. Thus we find in the winter semester of 
188889 and in summer of 1889 that of 12,893 German students in 
Prussian universities 161 are in their nineteenth semester, 185 in the 
fifteenth to the eighteenth semester, 927 in the tenth to the fourteenth 
semester. The greatest number of those who study so long belong 
to the medical faculty; the next number is that of the students of the 
philosophic faculty, and especially of the division of philology and 
history. 
It must not be ignored in this connection that a change of profes- 
sion, and hence a transfer from one faculty to another, occurs compara- 
tively often. The Prussian statistics give information on this point 
for the period from 1886 to 1888, We note the following ratios: Of the 
students of Protestant theology, 6 per cent had belonged to another 
faculty; of the Catholic theology, 11 per cent; of the law students, 9-4 
per cent; of the medical students, 11:5 per cent; of the students of 
philosophy, 6 per cent; this gives us an average of 8:5 percent. Since 
such changes always cause a loss of time, this high percentage can not 
be regarded as a favorable sign. In the Protestant theologic faculty 
the number of those who entered it from the other faculties and those 
who left it were about equal; the Catholic theologic faculty had a gain 
of 1:5 per cent; the law faculty had also a gain, but an insignificant 
one; the medical had a considerable gain of 9 per cent, while the philo- 
sophie had a loss of 7:3 per cent. The Protestant theologians who for- 
sake their faculty more frequently join the law or medical faculty than 
that of philosophy. Catholic theologians prefer medicine and natural 
sciences. The law students prefer medicine, while the medical students 
choose law. The students of philosophy mostly enter the medical 
faculty, some the law faculty, and a few the theologic faculty. 
Only a small number of students complete their studies in one 
university. A large number change universities several times; many 
attend two or three different universities in order then to return to 
the first. We are not able to state these changes with accuracy; we 
ean compare from only fifteen universities the average number of new 
matriculations with the whole attendance, and thus state the average 
number of semesters spent by the students in these fifteen universities. 
During the year 1891-92 the comparison resulted in the fact that the 
average length of attendance was 3°12 semesters, or 1:56 years. These

         GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 845 
numbers may not express the truth accurately, since the foreigners are 
included in the comparison. The longest time was found to be spent 
by students in Kénigsberg, namely, 4$ semesters; in Breslau and 
Tiibingen, 4; while Heidelberg and Bonn, to which the students flock 
in summer, owing to the beautiful surroundings of the cities, show 
only 2 semesters. Naturally the facility with which students change 
their universities has constantly increased during the last five decades; 
for during the thirties the average tine spent by students in universi- 
ties was more than four semesters. The strongest migratory tendency 
is displayed by the law students, who during recent years spent on an 
average 2-58 semesters in one university; the Protestant theologians, 
3°15; the Catholic theologians, 4.62; the medical students, despite their 
very extensive course, 3:72; the students of the philosophic faculty, 
3:35 semesters, 
7. MILITARY SERVICE. ° 
~In connection with the foregoing, a brief remark concerning the 
military service may be inserted here. Not all the universities report 
under this head. Weare obliged to resort to statistics from Prussia 
only. : 
Of 12,775 German students who on an average attended the Prussian 
universities between 1886-’88, there were 661, or 5-2 per cent, under 
arms; 1,221, or 9-9 per cent, had been declared free from military duty; 
7,133, or 55:8 per cent, had still to serve; 2,959, or 23-2 per cent, had 
completed their service in the army; 802, or 6-3 per cent, had been 
assigned to the reserve force. 
Among every 100 whose military fate had already been decided—

   A comparatively large number of law students servein the army dur- 
ing their university course. Very few of them are found physically 
unable to serve under arms; also few of the medical students, because, 
though they may not be able to serve in the rank and file, they can be 
made use of as surgeons and physicians, Among those who are placed 
in the reserve, that is to say, are taken into the army on condition, the - 
law students furnish the smallest number.

  346 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
8. AGE OF THE STUDENTS. 
Our students come to us at a comparatively advanced age. In Prus- 
sia—the statistics which we are here following—one- half of all the grad- 
uates of gymnasia are over 20 years old. 
Among 11,475 German students, excluding students of agriculture, 
pharmacy, a all students who may be considered special, only 58 
were found to be less than 18 years, and only 1,424 under 20 years; 
that is 12-4 per cent. There were 33:3 per cent bee een 20and 22 years, 
40-9 per cent between 22 and 25 years, and 23-5 per cent were 25 
years and over. By far the greatest number of the students are in 
age between 20 and 25, The law students are the youngest; 18-4 per 
cent are under 20, nearly 43 per cent between 20 and 22, 33-6 per cent 
between 22 and 25, and only 5 per cent over 25 years. The cause 
of this is, that these students chiefly come from the better situa- 
ated families, where they received a well regulated education and 
attended good schools, while students of other faculties, notably the 
theologic, attended, to some extent at least, insufficient clementary 
and citizens’ schools, and then, later on, entered a gymnasium, whereby 
a loss of time was unavoidable. This explains that only 11:7 per 
cent of the Protestant theologians were under 20 years old, 43-4 per 
cent between 22 and 25, as against 33-6 per cent among the law stu- 
dents, although the officially prescribed course of both is equal in 
length. The Catholic theologic students are still older, because many 
of them ate peasants’ sons; only 7-5 per cent of them were under 20 
years old, 30°8 per cent neeen 20 and 22, and nearly 47 per cent 
between 29 and 25; 2°8 per cent were over 30. However, we have 
to consider that the average length of the course of such students is 
much longer than that of their Protestant colleagues. 
Among the medical students few are under 20, 9°7 per cent; however, 
19-5 per cent were over 25 years, which is considerably more than in 
any of the other faculties. The length of the course is much greater, 
and it is often extended voluntarily. For the same reason we find the 
students in the philosophic faculty are comparatively old and compar- 
atively young. The students of mathematics and natural sciences are 
sparsely represented among the students between 20 and 25 years of 
age, namely, with 68 per cent, while the total average is 74 per cent.

9. OCCUPATION OF THE FATHERS. 
It is not without interest to inquire into the professions and occupa- 
tions of the fathers.of the students, and to see what faculties the vari- 
ous categories choose. Twenty-one per cent of the students in Prus- 
sian universities came from social strata having academic culture; 
we determine this from the professional occupations of the fathers. 
But beside these, there are men of means, army officers of high rank, 
Janded proprietors, many of whom also have academic culture. Hence 
it may be presumed that not less than one-fourth of all the students 
have fathers who have had higher education. This percentage may be 
taken to be very nearly correct, since agricultural students, pharma- 
cists, and other special students are not excluded from the calculation. 
Seven per cent are sons of civil officers of high rank, including clergy- 
men. Fully one-third are sons of merchants, manufacturers, and landed 
proprietors. It is to be regretted that no distinction is made between 
artisans who own a little shop and owners of factories; neither has 
there been a distinction made between great merchants and small 
trades people, so that we can not distinguish the degree of wealth rep- 
resented by them. Local inquiries in Halle have resulted in the follow- 
ing figures: Of the 14:8 per cent of industrial people only 3-4 per cent 
were owners of factories, and 11-4 per cent simply artisans who had a 
shop, which number shows that the small people were much better rep- 
resented. Likewise among the landed proprietors not 2 per cent could 
be classed among the wealthy; 12:7 per cent were peasants, gardeners, 
and other agriculturists on a small scale. The number of students who 
were sons of subaltern officers and teachers without academic culture 
was 23 per cent, while 0-1 per cent were sons of day laborers and ser- 
vants. Almost 20 per cent of the students of theology followed the pro- 
fession of their fathers, and 58 per cent of the sons of clergymen attend- 
ing universities studied theology. Comparatively speaking, very few 
theologians are sons of high civil officers, about 6 per cent, more than 
one-third who are sons of officers of low rank and elementary school 
teachers. Farmers sent 14 percent to study theology; industrial peo- 
ple 13 per cent, of whom 12 per cent are to be classed as coming from 
artisans and mechanics (if the results of local inquiries are taken as a 
standard).

GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 351 
Among the Catholic theological students 29 per cent come from the 
humble homes of peasants, about as many are sons of subaltern officers 
and teachers of the lower grade, 22 per cent are sons of industrial 
people, chiefly from artisans. <A different state of atfairs is noticed 
among the law students; 18:5 per cent are sons of high civil officers, 
and nearly one-half of the sons of such men attending the university 
are enrolled in the law faculty. 
Of all the students of law 29 per cent have fathers who had acquired 
a higher education, 11 per cent are sons of officers and teachers of a 
low grade (the pecuniary means of teachers are rarely sufficient to 
meet the costs of preparing for the law), 9:5 per cent are sons of 
farmers, 6 per cent are sons of large landed proprietors (the latter 
exhibit a great inclination for the study of law), 18-5 per cent are sons 
of merchants, and 5-5 per cent are sons of industrial people. 
The sons of physicians preferably follow the profession of their 
fathers (55-2 per cent), but, owing to the comparatively small number 
of physicians, the medical profession furnished only 7-5 per cent of the 
medical students; other strata of academic culture furnished 20 per 
cent, about as many came from subaltern officers and teachers, while 
merchants and industrial people furnished 38 per cent. Almost iden- 
tically the same percentage of the students of the philosophic facuity 
was sent by merchants and industrial people, but only 13 per cent had 
fathers possessing academic culture. Subaltern officers and teachers 
supplied 23-5 per cent of the students of philosophy, of whom the greater 
number devoted themselves to philology. 
From the foregoing we notice an upward tendency in all strata of 
society; then, on the other hand, we notice that those classes who have 
the advantage of birth or wealth are not able to meet the demand of 
the country for people of academic culture. 
10. THE RELIGION OF GERMAN STUDENTS. 
With regard to this important question we regret to be obliged to 
resort to the statistics of Prussian universities exclusively. The whole 
population of the state contains 64.24 per cent Protestants, but the per- 
centage of Protestant students in universities is somewhat larger, 
namely 72-11 per cent. About the same percentage of students is found 
in the middle schools, but 80-88 per cent in the secondary schools, and 
63:13 per cent in the elementary schools. The Catholic population 
amounts to 34.15 per cent. In the elementary schools the percentage 
of Catholic pupils is 33-71 per cent. In the niiddle schools the number 
sinks to 10:4 per cent, while in the secondary schools itrises to 17:5 per 
cent, and in the universities to 18-62 per cent. Hence Catholics do not 
aspire to higher education so much as the Protestants. This is partly 
explained by the fact that in the eastern provinces of Prussia the rural 
laboring class consists of Poles, who belong to the Catholic faith, and 
among whom a university student is a remarkable exception. The 
diametrical opposite is noticed among the Jews, who constitute only 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
  352 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
1:28 per cent of the entire population. They are represented in ele- 
mentary schools by 0-74 per cent, in the middle schools by 8:3 per cent, 
in the secondary schools by 9-7 per cent, in the universities by 8-9 per 
cent. Among the law students the percentages vary little from the 
general average; the philosophic faculty also shows small variations 
from the average. In the medical faculty the Protestants recede a lit- 
tle from their average, showing only 59-5 per cent; the Catholics rise to 
21-7 per cent; the Jews exhibit the remarkably high percentage of 18:5 
per cent, for over one-half of all the Jews studying in the universities 
are enrolled in the medical faculties.

       11. PROFESSORS IN GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 
A distinguished Englishman, James Bryce, M.P., professor in Oxford 
(in his preface to The German Universities for the Last 50 Years, by 
Dr. J. Conrad, Glasgow, 1885), has said that the great capacity for 
work of the German universities is chiefly owing to the great number 
of professors, which allows an extensive division of labor, and gives the 
teachers a chance to restrict themselves to comparatively few lectures 
in order thereby to gain time for independent scientific work or private 
instruction to the students. These considerations make it appear nec- 
essary to observe the present number of professors, and to subject it 
to analysis and comparison. 
Altogether there are in German universities 2,275 professors, to whom 
must be added 26 teachers of modern languages, and a number of 
teachers of agriculture, dentistry, etc., also teachers of drawing, 
 
-P-A-G-E-381
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. = 353 
dancing, fencing, gymnastics, and riding, who are not of equal rank 
with the professors. During the last fifty years the number of profes- 
sors has nearly doubled, but it has not increased in the same ratio in 
which the students increased, for the average number of students to 
a professor, which was 9:5 in 1840, and 8-9 in 1870, is now 12:2. Not 
one-half of all the professors, or 1,029, are regular salaried professors, 
591 are extraordinary, and 655 private lecturers. The number of reg- 
ular profesSors has increased least of all, namely, from 633 fifty years 
ago to 1,029. While in 1840 the regular professors had on an average 
18 students each, they have now 27 each. The number of extraordinary 
and private professors has more than doubled, but on the whole the 
proportion between these two classes has not essentially changed. 
Fifty years ago the number of regular professors amounted to 52 per 
cent of the total number, and that number was maintained until very 
recently, when in 1892 it sank to 45-2 per cent. The extraordinary 
professors gradually rose from 20-8 per cent to 25-9 per cent; the pri- 
vate lecturers numbered in 1840, 26-9 per cent; in 1880, 24-9 per cent, 
while in 1892 the number rose to 28-9 per cent. The great number of 
_ 655 young professors, who, without receiving salary, devote themselves 
to teaching and scientific work, and from whom the regular professors 
are recruited, form, as is well known, the essential fountain for the con- 
tinuous influx of new life into our university system, and also for the 
promotion of science, since they lay most stress upon writing on scientific 
subjects, through which alone they can hope to rise to higher positions.

the philosophic faculty, namely 1,197; and in this faculty the greatest 
increase is noticeable, especially in late years. In 1840 we find 536, or 
1 professor to every 5 students; at present 1 to every 6. The propor- 
tion of the three classes of professors in this faculty is about the same 
that we find in the sum total.
-P-A-G-E-383
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 355 
The smallest increase is found in the faculty of Protestant theology, 
where the number of professors has risen from 146 to 155 within fifty 
years; however, the number had fallen to 114in 1860. Inthis faculty the 
regular professors constitute the greater percentage, namely, 66 per 
cent, against 19:3 per cent of extraordinary and 14 per cent of private 
professors. This cireumstance has often proved annoying, so that it 
has been found necessary to call to chairs in universities ordained min- 
isters who had distinguished themselves by scientific publications. In 
this faculty the number of students to 1 professor is 25; in 1880 it was 
14; the number of students to 1 regular professor is now 37:6; twelve 
years ago it was 20-4. 
The Catholic faculties have at present 63 professors, with an average 
of 21:8 students each. Since in this faculty private professors are 
exceptions, the number of regular professors, 78 per cent, is greater 
than in any other faculty. In 1880 the proportion was 80 per cent, 
with only 6 per cent. extraordinary professors. 
The law faculty has at present 222 professors, 1 for every 31 
students. This is by far the greatest relative number of students 
noticedanywhere, and is owing to the enormous throng attracted to the 
study of law. In this faculty the percentage of extraordinary profes- 
sors, 14 per cent, is below the average; also the number of private pro- 
fessors is smaller than the average, at present 20 per cent, while in 
1880 it was 13 per cent. 
The division of labor has taken place in the medical faculty more 
than in theology and law. The number of professors has increased to 
more than twice the number it had fifty years ago. However, we must 
consider the fact that the aspiration of practical physicians in large 
céties is to obtain a position in the university in order to gain the con- 
fidence of the public. Hence the number of private professors is larger 
than in any of the other faculties. It is at present 37 per cent of the 
whole number of the medical professors. Also the number of ex- 
traordinary professors is comparatively large, namely, 30 per cent, 
which may be owing partly to the cause mentioned before, partly also 
to the fact that more specialties have been developed in the study 
of medicine than there are regular chairs. Only few universities have 
regular chairs for aural diseases, dentistry, psychiatry, hygiene, chil- 
dren’s diseases, etc. Therefore the number of regular professors is at 
present only 33 per cent, whereas it was 47 per cent fifty years ago. 
However much the number of professors has increased the number of 
students has increased much faster; while formerly the average num- 
ber of students to a professor was 6 to 8, now it is 12, and while the 
regular professor had 12 to 19, now he has 41. 
Naturally the number of professors in the different universities varies 
very much. Berlin has the most, namely, 341 professors, 3 language 
teachers, and 3 teachers of dentistry. The number of regular professors 
is 83, or less than one-fourth of the whole number, the number of extra- 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
    356 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
ordinary and honorary professors is 198, the number of private professors 
is 160, or nearly one-half of all the professors. It is easily seen that 
the metropolis, with its many scientific institutions and the great num- 
ber of advanced students who form the chief audience for special lec- 
tures, attracts men of scientific aspirations more than the small towns. 
Besides, what we said concerning the medical profession holds good 
particularly here, where we find 15 regular, 30 extraordinary, and 66 
private medical professors, a proportion that can not be duplicated by 
any other university. The philosophic faculty has the enormous number 
of 76 private professors (the theologic faculty only 4, the law faculty 
only 8), 51 extraordinary, and only 50 regular professors. 
The other large universities fall considerably behind Berlin. Leipzig 
has 168 professors, Munich, 152, The difference is explained, in the 
first place, by the smaller number of private professors, Leipzig has 
59, Munich, 64. In Munich the number of extraordinary professors falls 
behind that of Leipzig (29 as against 78). The smallest university, Ros- 
tock, has 44 professors; that is 31 regular, 8 extraordinary, and 5 private 
professors. Giessen has 58 professors, among whom there are 39 regu- 
lar, Jena with a few more students is better supplied with professors, 
namely, with 82, many of whom are extraordinary and honorary pro- 
fessors (56). “A similar proportion is found in beautiful Heidelberg, 
that has 45 regular, 44 extraordinary, and 20 private professors. Very 
much different from this proportion is that of Erlangen, which has 41 
regular, 7 extraordinary, and 8 private professors. 
From all this we see that in proportion to the students the smaller 
universities are better provided with professors than the larger ones, 
hence that they afford a more intimate personal intercourse between 
teachers and students, which is the chief advantage they offer. In 
these smaller universities, seminaries, practical exercises and other pri- 
vate instruction are frequently found; in them the students receive 
special inducements for scientific investigation, and the professor can 
impress his personality better upon his hearers than when he stands 
before a large assembly. 
12. DEGREES GRANTED IN GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 
The close of a university career is marked by state examinations 
prescribed by law for the various professions. We leave them out of 
consideration, since they do not interest us at this juncture, and turn 
to the examinations that are exclusively university affairs, that is, 
examinations for degrees. Degrees are granted only as an acknowl- 
edgment of purely scientific achievements; they secure no professional 
rights. 
The requirements for degree examinations depend upon the constitu- 
tional provisions of each university, hence differ considerably in various 
institutions. The examination fees, also, vary greatly, and this is one 
reason why some universities are preferred by candidates, who need not
-P-A-G-E-385
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 357 
have attended the full course of the institutions in which they wish to 
receive a degree. A great number of degrees conferred in a univer- 
sity may be an indication of active scientific aspiration and of great 
development of certain studies in that institution, but not necessarily 
so; it may be that the fees are lower, the requirements easier, or that 
the execution of the rules and regulations is laxer than in other univer- 
sities.

1 It was impossible to obtain the numbers for the same year, but the differences are so insignificant that this source of error sc yy needs to be considered. “The numbers for Prussian universities are 
gleaned from the publications of the Prussian minister of education; those for other German univer- 
ities are reported by the respective university secretaries. 
  In the Protestant theologic faculty the degree of doctor’ is extraor- 
dinarily rare; it is mostly granted honoris causa. The place of the 
degree of doctor is, as a rule, taken by that of licentiate. That also 
is rarely secured, because the requirements for that degree are almost 
as rigid as those for “habilitation,” or entering the university as pri- 
vate professor. During the last scholastic year, only 18 theologians 
were promoted to the degree of doctor or licentiate after passing the 
examinations, but 22 doctor degrees were conferred honoris causa. 
In the Catholic theologic faculty, also, the granting of a degree is 
an exception; only 17 candidates secured it, during the last year, 
while 2 were honorary degrees. 
In the law faculty 368 degrees were given and 8 honorary. The 
greatest number was conferred in Leipzig, 112, while in Munich and  
-P-A-G-E-386
  
    358 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Berlin, where the number of law students was much greater, only 7, 
5 degrees, respectively, were conferred. After Leipzig came Heidel- 
berg (69), Jena (63), Erlangen (45), and Géttingen (31); in other uni- 
versities the number varies between 1 and 7. 
In the medical faculty the number of degrees conferred has in recent 
years greatly decreased, since the degree no longer opens the gates 
of the medical profession; the state examination alone does that. 
Nevertheless the number of medical degrees is still very large and is 
kept high, owing to the enormous throng to the study of medicine. 
Last year 1,442 degrees were conferred after successful examinations, — 
but only 8 honorary degrees. Again Leipzig stands at the head of 
the list with 299, then follow Wiirzburg with 163, Munich with 154, 
Berlin with 146, while Giessen, Rostock, and Marburg, conferred only 
12, 13, and 20 degrees. : 
In the philosophic faculty the number of degrees granted last year 
was 973 and 14 honoris causa. Though in this faculty comparatively few 
pursue their studies for the purpose of general culture (the greater num- 
ber preparing themselves to enter a profession, as is done in the other 
faculties almost exclusively), there still are such cases; but even then 
the students endeavor to pass the examination for a degree, because they 
thereby indicate to the world that they have completed their studies. 
It is done. by literary men, private teachers, chemists, agriculturists 
and wealthy men who do not intend to enter a definite profession. 
Besides, future teachers, authors, chemists, etc., regard the degree as 
a letter of recommendation, and asa means of aiding them in their 
eareers. Leipzig heads the list in the number of degrees conferred in 
this faculty also. It conferred 143 last year, Erlangen 104, Berlin 88, 
Halle 75, while Bonn conferred only 21, Greifswald 18, and Giessen 15. 
The sum total of all degrees conferred in Germany during the last 
year was 2,818, to which should be added 54 honorary degrees. 
13. INCOME AND EXPENDITURES OF GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 
The regular expenditures for maintaining German universities (we 
quote the budgets of 1891-92) amount to 19,912,913 marks (or $4,797,- 
100). This total does not express the entire cost of maintenance, since 
various subsidies on the part of governmental departments from the 
general disposition fund, expended for the universities, can not be aceu- 
rately stated. Nor does the total stated include the amount of fees 
paid by the students for lecture courses—fees that constitute a consid- 
erable part of the professors’ income. They are not entered as regular 
items in the financial statements of the universities, because formerly 
the students paid them directly to the professors; only recently the 
“Quéstor” of the institution collects them. Up to late years we had 
no way of determining the amount of students’ fees for lectures. 
Neither does the total mentioned include the payments made by 
patients in clinics.
-P-A-G-E-387
    
- GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. ooo 
To the regular expenditures should be added considerable sums for 
new buildings and purchases that do not occur at stated intervals. 
These sums vary in different years; hence the statement of one year does 
not suffice. In fe these extraordinary expenditures amounted 
to 3,280,385 marks (or $787,292) for Prussian and 4,768,173 marks (or 
$1,144,362) for other German universities. These emcenes came from 
state treasuries except the small sum of 46,125 marks (or $11,170), which 
was derived from invested funds, In the course of the following remarks 
we shall consider only the regular income and expenditure, except 
where expressly stated. 
The average sum expended for every student in German universities 
is 708 marks ($170), or 0.4 marks (or $0.096) per capita of the popula, 
tion. Of the sum total 22:5 per cent is derived from invested funds, 
real estate, rents, etc., inclusive of fees, 75-4 per cent from state or 
provincial subsidies. A mere trifle—namely, about $2,000—came from 
other sources. The state treasury in Prussia paid for the universities 
0.26 mark (or $0.0624) per capita of the population; in Bavaria, 0.31 
mark (or $0.0744); in France the state pays 0.28 mark (or $0.0672). 
The sums spent for the maintenance of the various universities differ 
greatly. Berlin requires 2,476,786 marks (or $594,429), of which only 
13.6 per cent is derived from the universitys’ own sources. | Leipzig 
follows with 1,987,468 marks (or $476,992), of which 22 per cent is de- 
rived from the universitys’ own funds. Bonn, Gottingen, Halle, also 
require more than a million marks (more than $240,000) each; Breslau, 
Konigsberg, Munich, Strassburg, between 900,000 and a million marks. 
The smallest sum is required by Rostock, 332,300 marks (or $79,752). 
The other universities vary between 500,000 and 900,000 marks ($120,000 
and $216,000).

  The subsidies from the State treasury to the various universities 
are very unequal. The Prussian universities receive an average of 
72:7 per cent, the other German universities an average of 80-5 per 
cent. While Breslau receives 92:8 per cent, Kénigsberg and Berlin 
87 per cent, Bonn 81:1 per cent from the State, Greifswald receives 
only 39 per cent, Gottingen 36-4 per cent. To Rostock and Heidelberg 
the State pays 98 and 97 per cent, Tiibingen 88 per cent; Jena, how- 
ever, only 56 per cent. 
If we compare these i incomes, or rather expenditures (which in this
-P-A-G-E-389
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 361 
case means the same), with the number of students, we find in the differ- 
ent universities a very great inequality. Despite the extraordinarily 
large expenditures of Berlin, they amount only to 489 marks (or $117) 
per student, the lowest per capita in Germany, except that of Munich, 
where it is only 264 marks (or $63). Wiirzburg has the same per cap- 
ita that Berlin has; the largest per capita is found in Gottingen, Kiel, 
and K6énigsberg, namely over 1,300 marks (or $312). The per capita in 
Giessen is nearly that much, while in Strasburg 1,068 marks (or $256). 
The other universities vary between 500 ($120) and 900 marks ($216). 
The per capita of the state subsidies in Prussia is 592 marks (or 
$142), while in other German universities, is 458 marks (or $110). 
Our sources of information give only two items of expenditure, 
namely, personal and incidental, but both are regular or current. The 
former means salaries and the other personal expenditures. The sala- 
ries amount to 7,772,726 marks ($1,865,454), or 39 per cent. The other 
personal expenditures amount to 4,300,379 marks ($1,032,091), or 21:5 
per cent. The incidental expenses* amount to 7,839,808 marks 
($1,879,394), or 39:5 per cent. These incidental expenses include the 
endrmous sums used for new buildings, which in Table Xa are given 
separately under the head of extraordinary expenditures. The new 
university buildings erected in late years require millions every year. 
In 1891-92 Berlin alone required 1,234,294 marks (or $296,231), or 45 
per cent of the expenditures for that year. In Munich this item 
claimed only 300,560 marks (or $72,134), or not quite 20 per cent, but 
it required nearly 200,000 marks (or $48,000) for extraordinary purposes 
(not for buildings). In Halle the buildings claimed more than 50 per 
cent of the extraordinary expenses; besides 329,000 marks (or $78,960), 
were needed for extraordinary purposes. 
The column containing the salaries does not state the whole income 
of the professors, since the lecture fees are not included. The public 
lecture courses are free; for private lecture courses the professors 
charge a fee of 3 to 5 marks (or 72 cents to $1.20) per semester (one 
lesson a week). For medical practice, work in the natural sciences, 
demonstrations in the clinics, work in laboratories, in the dissecting 
rooms, and in microscopic courses, etc., various fees are paid, some very 
high. For certain studies that require a considerable number of hours 
on the part of the professor, 40 to 70 marks (or $10 to $17) per semester 
is charged, without costing the professor anything for material or for 
assistants’ work. 
The income of the professor varies very much according to the num- 
ber of lectures and their attendance. It is to be regretted that a com- 
plete summary of these incomes is not available for comparison. But 
in order to obtain material for an estimate we state that, on an average, 
in the Prussian university the total income from fees amounts to about 
  
  
* New buildings, libraries, clinics, hospitals, laboratories, museums, repairs, fuel and 
light, ete.
-P-A-G-E-390
  862 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
one-half the professors’ fixed salary. The various professors participate 
in these incomes from fees in a very unequal manner, for it must be 
remembered that the extraordinary and private professors who receive 
no fixed salary rely entirely upon the lecture fees. 
A just estimate of the income from all the sources gives to salaries 
~ (ineluding rent where dwellings are not provided) and other personal 
remunerations (such as traveling expenses) 63-7 per cent, to lecture 
fees 32-9 per cent, and to other fees (matriculation, examinations, and 
diplomas) 3-4 per cent. The latter fees play an important rdle in 
some universities and faculties, while they almost disappear in others. 
Naturally only the regular professors draw these fees; they also receive 
the largest part of the lecture fees, because they, as a rule, have the 
largest audiences. 
In Bavaria, during the years 1869-1872, the lecture fees amounted to 
13 per cent of the entire university income. In Tiibingen, during the 
year 1875-’76, the fees amounted to 15 per cent of the entire income of 
the university, and 25:9 per cent of the salaries and remunerations. 
The Prussian official statistics offer very exact information concern- 
ing the professors’ salaries. According to the budget of 1892-93, “the 
salaries of professors amount to 3,429,015 marks (or $822,964), besides 
561,912 marks (or $134,859) are paid for rent of dwellings. Since the 
officers who receive subsidies for rent do not cut a great figure, we can 
round off the ttvo sums in a total of 3,980,000 marks (or $915,200). But 
we are not able to state accurately the amount paid for rent to the dif- 
ferent classes of professors; hence can not separate this item from the 
salaries. 
To 534 regular professors the sum of 2,955,120 marks was paid, an 
average of 5,534 marks ($1,328). The minimum salary was $360; the 
maximum salary was $3,024. To 187 extraordinary professors the sum 
of 457,740 marks was paid, an average of 2,448 marks (or $588). The 
minimum salary was $144, the maximum was $1,052. Ninety-two 
extraordinary professors did not receive a salary. 
As a matter of course, in large universities higher salaries are paid 
than in smaller institutions. The average salary of a regular professor 
in Berlin was 7,396 marks (or $1,775). The salaries here vary between 
3,000 and 12,000 marks ($720 and $2,880). In Greifswald the average 
salary was 4,670 marks (or $1,120), the salaries varying between 2,800 
and 6,000 marks (or $672 and $1,440). 
The salary of a regular professor was: In the Protestant theological 
faculty, average, 5,797 marks (or $1,391); minimum, 3,200 marks (or 
$768); maximum, 10,200 marks (or $2,448). In the Catholic theologi- 
eal faculty, average, 4,332 marks (or $1,040); minimum, 1,500 marks 
(or $360); maximum, 6,000 marks (or $1,440). In the law faculty, 
_ average, 6,044 marks (or $1,450); minimum, 2,700 marks (or $648); 
maximum, 12,600 marks (or $3,024). In the medical faculty, average, 
5,194 marks (or $1,247); minimum, 3,000 marks (or $720); maximum,
-P-A-G-E-391
  GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 363 
8,400 marks (or $2,016). In the philosophic faculty, average, 5,576 | 
marks (or $1,338); minimum, 1,500 marks (or $360); maximum, 12,000 
marks (or $2,880). 
These salaries are higher than those paid to teachers in secondary 
schools. They are about on a level with the salaries paid to judges of 
higher courts, only it must be remembered that judges have no other 
sources of income than their salaries. 
In Tiibingen (according to an anniversary publication of 1877) the 
salaries in 1877~78 were 4,400 marks ($1,056) paid to 16 regular profes- 
sors of the highest rank, 4,000 marks ($960) paid to 16 regular pro- 
fessors of the next lower rank, 3,000 marks ($720) paid to 17 regular 
professors of the lowest rank; 2,200 marks ($528) paid to 6 extra- 
ordinary professors of the higher, and 1,800 marks ($432) to4 extra- 
ordinary professors of the lower rank. The income from lecture fees 
amounted to 85,000 marks ($20,400) a few years previous to 1877~78. 
Since then the salaries have-been raised considerably. 
Beside the regular and extraordinary expenses tabulated in Tables 
X and Xa, other funds should be considered in which the professors 
have an interest. They are partly derived from the universities’ own 
property, and partly from ‘state subsidies for the benefit of widows 
and orphaus of professors. In order to place the widows and orphans 
above want and treat them all alike the Prussian state makes a con- 
tribution of 160,000 ($38,400) per annum to this fund. *According to the 
Jaw concerning pensions for widows and orphans of university pro- 
fessors the pension of the widow of a regular professor is 1,400 marks 
($336) per annum; that of a widow of an extraordinary professor 1,000 
marks ($240). The pension paid to an orphan is 600 marks ($144), to 
every additional orphan 400 marks ($96), to a half orphan 400 marks, 
to every additional half orphan 250 marks ($60). In some universities 
local funds for the support of widows and orphans of professors are 
maintained by societies. 
The Prussian minister of public instruction disposes annually of the 
sum of 60,000 marks ($14,400) in aiding private professors and other 
young persons of scientific attainments who prove of value to the 
universities. Likewise the universities themselves have funds for the 
support of such meri who draw no salaries, and at first have but a 
scanty income from lecture fees, but these local funds are insignificant. 
14, THE COSTS OF UNIVERSITY STUDY. 
The expenditures of students are different in the various universities. 
Naturally the differences arise from personal wants and from the dura- 
tion and extent of the study chosen. Since minute statistics, or general 
statements concerning the cost of university study, do not exist, we are 
again obliged to resort to an example. We choose the Prussian uni- 
versity of Géttingen as an institution of medinm size. 
The matriculation fee is 15 marks (about $4), the auditory fee 2 
marks (50 cents), and contribution to the sick fund 7 marks ($1.75).
-P-A-G-E-392
  
  364 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Medical and chemical students pay special fees for the use of institutes 
(such as laboratories, clinics, hospitals) about 5 marks ($1.25). ‘When 
a student severs his connection with the university he also pays a small 
fee to have the fact entered opposite his name on the rolls. Other fees 
for the practical use of institutes amount to only a few marks. The 
accounts of a few students have been carefully sifted, and an annual 
average calculated; these then are multiplied by the average number 
of years to determine the total average cost of a university career. 
Students of theology pay 7 marks matriculation and other fees, 53 
marks lecture fees (which vary between 21 and 110 marks), together 
60 marks per semester. This gives for 7-2 semesters a total of 432 
marks ($104). 
Law students pay almost the same sums: 7 marks matriculation and 
other fees, 62 marks lecture fees (the maximum paid was found to be 
122 marks), together 69 marks per semester. This gives for 6°75 
semesters a total of 466 marks ($112). 
Medical students pay 17-5 marks matriculation and other fees, 125:5 
marks lecture fees (maximum 343 marks), and other trifling fees, to- 
gether 145 marks per semester. This gives for 10-2 semesters a total 
of 1,479 marks ($355). ; 
Students of philology pay 7 marks matriculation and other fees, 51 
marks lecture fees (maximum 110 marks), together 58 marks per sem- 
ester, or for 10 semesters 580 marks ($130). 
Students of mathematics and natural science pay 9°75 marks matric- 
ulation and other fees, 56-22 marks lecture fees (maximum 144 marks), 
together about 66 marks, or for 9-5 semesters a total of 627 marks 
($150). 
Students of chemistry pay 27-23 marks matriculation and other fees, 
87:20 marks lecture fees (maximum 172 marks), together 11450 marks, 
or for 9-5 semesters a total of 1,083 marks (#260). 
In Halle the matriculation fee for a student just coming from a 
secondary school is 17:25 marks ($4.14), and 13-75 marks ($3.29) for 
a student who comes from another university. The fee for ex-matric- 
ulation is lowest for the students of philosophy, 10:50 marks ($2.52), 
the highest fee for the law students, 16-50 marks ($3.96). Fees as 
hearers are paid per semester 5 marks ($1.20), institute fees likewise 5 
marks ($1.20). 
Regarding the cost of medical study we have the result of an inves- 
tigation embracing all the Prussian universities which exhibits great 
varieties. In Konigsberg the study costs 1,515 marks ($363.60), in 
Berlin 2,049 marks ($491.70). 
In order to obtain still another item by which to judge the cost of 
university study we mention, that in Halle, with 1,525 students, the 
fees for matriculation and examination, auditory fees, etc., amounted 
to 26,683 marks ($6,404) in one year, which is 17:5 per capita, or not 
quite 30 marks for every new student. The lecture fees paid amounted 
to 175,300 marks (41.072), or 114 marks ($27.36) per capita, or 57
-P-A-G-E-393
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 365 
marks ($13.68) per semester. To this item should be added 31,206 
fees for degree examinations, and habilitation fees (the latter are quite 
insignificant) amounting to 2 marks (48 cents) per capita of the 
students. The fees for state examinations can not be mentioned here, 
because they rarely get into the hands of the professors. 
In the Bavarian universities the lecture fees during the years 1869-70 
were on an average 165,012 marks ($39,603), that is, 13 per cent of the 
total income of these universities. It was equal to 74:3 marks ($17.83) 
per capita of the students, and 175 marks ($42.00) for every student 
who paid lecture fees. g 
It would be hazardous to make any definite statements concerning 
the personal expenditures of the students, that is, cost of life, since 
much depends upon the mode of life of the students in their parenta] 
home, and upon personal taste and inclinations, ete. We know of 
cases in which the students did not, spend more than 700 marks ($168) 
per year;-of course, the payment of lecture fees in this case was post- 
poned, and living at home during vacation was a necessity. Onan 
average the great majority of students pay between 1,000 and 1,500 
mafks per annum, while for the the wealthier students an average of 
1,800 to 2,000 marks may be assumed; the very wealthy of course go 
much beyond that. 
15. BENEFICES. 
Since time out of date pecuniary aid has been offered to students, in 
order to facilitate their attendance in the university; this has been 
done in three ways. First, by postponing the payment of lecture fees; 
second, by granting free dinners, and third, by benefices in cash. It 
is to be regretted that complete statements concerning these benefices 
are not available; it is only in recent years that the Prussian university 
statistics offer any information under this heading. 
How the lecture fees are to be paid, as well as their amounts, for 
what period the paying of the fees may be postponed, are questions 
settled by the professors themselves. In Prussian universities indigent 
students are relieved temporarily from the payment of these fees, if 
they petition for postponement and furnish the questor with documen- 
tary evidence of poverty, signed by home authorities. Usually the pay- 
ment is postponed for six years, after which the questor attempts to 
collect the fees, unless the debtor has no fixed employment or regular 
source of income. Frequently the final settlement is set aside, if the 
debtor’s financial condition remains unsatisfactory. In late. years the 
petitions for postponement of payment of fees have considerably de- 
creased in number; they are found almost exclusively in the theologic 
and philosophic faculties. The postponement of payment is not granted 
with the same liberality in all the universities. The principle has been 
adopted lately of not postponing the payment of any fees during the 
first semester; in other universities the postponement holds good only 
for the time of study in that particular institution. Where postpone-  
-P-A-G-E-394
  366 EDUCATION REPORT, 1391-92. 
ment is customary, release from payment is excluded, while in some 
universities a commission examines each case and releases the student 
from payment; but in such institutions postponement is not customary. 
During the year 1887-’88 the payment of fees was postponed in 3,010 
cases, or 22 per cent of all students; 2,891 of these students were native 
Prussians, 94 had come from other parts of Germany, 25 were foreign- 
ers. During that year 25-63 per cent of the Prussian students enjoyed 
this kind of benefice (in 8 semesters an average of 26-1 per cent). The 
proportions varied in different universities: while in Berlin, Bonn, 
Halle, Kiel, and Kénigsberg the percentage was 20-4 and 20-9 per, cent, 
it was only 7:6 per cent in Marburg, 9:3 per cent in Gottingen, 10 per 
cent in Braunsberg, 17-6 per cent in Miinster, but 54:5 per cent in 
Greifswald. Some of those who enjoyed these benefices were sons of 
professors, who according to the charter of the institution are exempt 
from lecture fees, but their number is very small. There are also cases 
of professors who do not charge for private instruction to foreigners, 
but such cases do not come under observation. Some students pay 
part of their fees and postpone the payment of the other. 
Allin all, it may be said that fully one-fourth of all the students* are 
in needy circumstances, and furnish proof of this fact, whereupon the 
benefice mentioned is accorded them. This percentage is considerably 
increased if we add those who receive benefices in cash in addition to 
the postponement of lecture fees, or depend upon aid in cash only. 
In Prussia 2,430, or 17-9 per cent, of all the students received cash 
benefices; 76 of these were foreigners, 236 were Germans, but not 
native Prussians. Free dinners were given to 1,052 persons, or 7-7 per 
eent.of the students. But since these dinners were frequently given to 
the same persons, it will not do to add the total numbers of the three 
elasses in order to arrive at the number of those who enjoy benefices. 
If each one is counted but once, we get a total of 4,510, or more than 
one-third of all the students. Among these were 88 foreigners, 414 
Prussians, and 308 other Germans. The Prussians represent a per- 
centage of 36-48 per cent of the students; 18-74 per cent received bene- 
fices in cash and 8-77 per cent free dinners. There can be no doubt that 
the number of beneficiaries is actually greater than stated in the fore- 
going, because many are not counted who receive aid from private 
sources in their native towns. This phase of the question is of greater 
importance in regard to the amount of benefices than in regard to the 
number of beneficiaries. 
Altogether 2,868 German students received cash aid and free dinners 
amounting toa value of 441,619 marks ($105,989), which is equal to 
154 marks ($37) per semester. Since the number of benefices given 
was 3,346, it is plain that a number of students receive several kinds 
of benefices. However, this statement falls much behind the actual 
truth; the causes of this are found in the foregoing. Seventy per cent 
of 3,346 cases of aid consisted of cash gifts and 30 per cent free dinners. 
The 70 per cent in number had a value of 87 per cent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
    
GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 367 
‘A word concerning the sources of these benefices may be welcome. 
We state that 1,341=40 per cent, valued at 134,745 marks ($32,339), 
30-5 per cent were derived from funds of the universities; 1,470=42-9 
per cent, valued at 212,708 marks ($51,050) =48 per cent were derived 
from funds appropriated by municipal governments, corporations, ete., 
and 535=17-1 per cent, valued at 94,166 marks ($22,600) =21-5 per cent 
were derived from family endowments. Concerning the last men- 
tioned item we may say that, owing to want of information, it may be 
yery much too small. The Prussian minister of education paid in 
189192 the sum of 68,766 marks ($16,704) to needy students and 
beside that had at his disposal a fund of 160,000 marks ($24,000) for 
such students of German parentage who consented to accept govern- 
ment positions in the Polish provinces. ‘he foregoing numbers are 
distributed among the faculties as follows:

   From the foregoing table we see that the students of theology are the 
most numerous of those receiving aid, partly because they are mostly in 
needy circumstances; partly, also, because for such students the largest 
benefit funds are in existence. The percentage of the philosophic fac- 
ulty, which used to be much larger, has decreased in late years in conse- 
quence of the addition of students who did not formerly have the right 
of citizenship in the university, such as agriculturists, pharmacists, etc., 
and for whom very few endowments for scholarships and benefices exist. 
The amounts paid to individuals is generally very small. Almost 
one half the number of cash benefices amounted to 100 marks ($24) or 
less per semester. Only 38 amounted to 500-800 marks ($120-$192). 
Only 9 amounted to 800 marks and more. 
The statistics of public instruction in the Kingdom of Bavaria, 
embracing the years 1869-1892, contain the statement that of every 
100 students, 20 were completely exempt from the payment of lecture 
fees; 25 partially so; together, 45 per cent. Of the students of the- 
ology 59 per cent belong to that class; of the law students, 40 per cent; 
of the medical students, 39 per cent; of the students of philosophy, 50 
per cent. Fifteen per cent of the students (330) received aid in cash 
(54,298 marks or $13,132) =164-5 marks ($39.38) per capita. 
It is reasonable to suppose that in Bavaria as well as in Prussia the

number of needy students has diminished during the last twenty years, 
in consequence of which the cases of exemption from payment of 
lecture fees are now less numerous than at the beginning of the 
seventies.

INTRODUCTION. 
The subject of special schools, preparing young men for the service 
of the state in the various positions of the civil service, is of interest 
from a double point of view—that of education and that of an efficient 
personnel of Government employés. Of the two, the latter interest 
is probably the more important. 
Of the number of movements looking towards the improvement of 
the general conditions of society under which all must live, the move- 
ment for better government is prominent. Good government can be 
said to be the result of two conditions—that of a good system and that 
of the capacity and honesty of those who administer it. The first of 
these can to some extent be absent. The latter is a sine qua non. Hon.

James Bryce has shrewdly said that such is the capacity for govern- 
ment of the New Englanders that they can make a bad system of gov- 
ernment give good results. But, however good the system of govern- 
ment may be, the results can not be good unless it is honestly and 
efficiently administered. Whatever efforts are made in other direc- 
tions every effort should also be made to secure the best men for the 
most important and responsible positions in government administra- 
tion. 
It is difficult to see why the government Service should not be con- 
sidered as a profession to be as deliberately chosen as any other. There 
is no one institution in which the people are so vitally interested. 
Certainly every movement which will tend to raise the position of ser- 
vant of the state to a more honorable standing and to attract to it the 
best men of the country is a step in the right direction. 
The purpose of the present paper is to present a sketch of the efforts 
which have been made by France to secure an efficient personnel for 
the higher branches of government service through the establishment 
of special government schools preparing for particular services of the 
state. 
France more than any other country affords us material for the study 
of the results of the policy of recruiting the civil service through the 
establishment of special government schools preparing for particular 
branches of the service. Two conditions in the character of the French 
life have contributed powerfully to this result—the great centralization 
and increase of governmental activities and the specialization in the 
system of public instruction. In America the average youth attends 
school and on the completion of his studies determines in what direction 
he will turn his energies. Fortuitous events determine, in a majority of 
cases, the occupation of each. In France quite the reverse is true. So 
difficult is the establishment of a position in business that the French 
boy must at the very earliest opportunity make a selection of the pro- 
fession he wishes to follow and then direct all his energies toward 
attaining this goal. As a result the system of technical education has 
received a development unequaled by that of any other country of 
Europe, Switzerland possibly excepted, and to an extent which it 
would take years of growth for American and English technical schools 
to equal. There is not a trade, and one might almost say not a branch 
of a trade, which does not have special schools devoted to preparing 
students in the acquisition of the technical knowledge necessary for 
its efficient prosecution. What is true of private business is not less 
true of governmental activities. The technical branches of govern- 
ment administration have been considered as professions to be prepared 
for as for any other profession. 
The second condition which has been mentioned, that of the great in- 
crease in governmental activities, has contributed no less to this result. 
One inust have his residence for some time in France to realize the im-
-P-A-G-E-399

portant part which government plays in the life of the French people. 
Not only has there been during the present century a constant develop- 
ment of the duties usually performed by a central government, but 
the domain of private business has been entered, and numerous serv- 
ices have been added to the state. Political and social conditions have 
led to the assumption of the telegraphic, telephonic, and, in part, the 
railway system of the country. Economic conditions have long caused 
the French Government to busy itself with such important interests as 
forestry and the cultivation of improved breeds of domestic animals. 
Financial and other considerations have led to the assumption by the 
Government of the manufacture or exploitation of salt, tobacco, 
matches, powder, saltpeter, special tapestry and porcelain products, ete. 
Enormous sums have been spent within recent years on public improve- 
ments, roads, bridges, and canals, and these improvements are made 
much more directly by Government employés than is the case with us. 
All of this has not only required a great development of the civil 
service, but also the employment by the state of large numbers of men 
of whom a high degree of technical skill and ability is required. 
Such industries as forestry and the manufacture of products which 
are state monopolies can necessarily have no similar establishments 
from which to draw their employés, and a training by the state thus 
becomes almost a necessity. 
Among a people where government plays such an important part as 
in France and where the government service necessarily absorbs a not 
ineonsiderable part of the workers of the country, the whole school 
system must have in view to a greater or less extent the preparation 
for this service. The greater number of positions, especially the subor- 
dinate ones, require little of what we call technical instruction, at least 
other than that which must be gained by actual experience in the posi- 
tions in question. There are, however, a considerable and ever increas- 
ing number of positions for the proper filling of which a previous special 
training is absolutely essential. For the recruitment of these two 
kinds of positions the Government of France has taken into considera- 
tion this difference. For the first the Government-has instituted com- 
petitive examinations, which relate only to matters of secondary and in 
some cases only to primary education. In a certain number of services 
more severe examinations have been established for the employés occu- 
pying somewhat higher positions, as, for example, with the minister of 
the interior, the minister of finance, the prefecture of the Seine, ete. 
These examinations, as well as other tests established for admission to 
the service of inspection of the finances, imply a careful and to some 
extent special preparation. The preparation for these examinations is 
left to the general school system. 
For the positions requiring a technical preparation the Government 
has established a system of purely Government schools, specially pre- 
paring for these services. It is to these schools that this paper relates.

  “eoi2 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
A division must be made at the start between those technical schools 
which prepare exclusively for the army and navy and those preparing 
for other Government services. The first have been carried to a high 
degree of perfection, and special schools exist for the recruiting of each 
special branch of the army and navy. These schools are, however, of 
interest, chiefly from the military and naval standpoint, and their con- 
sideration does not come within the scope of this report. Also, such 
schools as the primary and superior normal schools, which prepare only 
indirectly for the Government service, scarcely come within the strict 
meaning of special schools preparing for Government employment. 
After these introductory remarks, which have been necessary to 
enable us to appreciate more fully the description of the French system, 
we will commence the consideration of the individual schools.    
THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL—Fcole Polytechnique. 
The idea of special preparation for Government employment through 
the aid of special schools is an old one in France. Francis I. projected 
the establishment of a school where 600 youths should be carefully 
trained to fill positions chiefly in the foreign service. In 1672 the Mar- 
quis de Torcy, secretary of state for foreign affairs, founded, under the 
name of Académie Politique, a diplomatic school to instruct young men 
to become secretaries of legations. These two enterprises, however, 
had but short lives. 
The real modern system of technical Government schools owes its 
origin chiefly to the military needs of the country, which were felt in 
the few years preceding the French Revolution. This period saw the 
establishment of a number of schools which are in active operation at 
the present day. The School of Bridges and Roads (Heole des Ponts et 
Chaussées) was founded in 1747, the School of Mines (cole des Mines) 
in (783, and the military school (Hcole Militaire de Paris) in 1851. 
These beginnings are, however, of more historical than practical 
interest. The system of government schools as it exists to-day really 
begins with the French Revolution and the establishment of the Poly- 
technic school. 
The history of the establishment of this school is interesting, as 
being the outcome of a deliberate plan for securing employés for the 
Government who should have had a careful preparatory scholastic 
training. The polytechnic is one of the products of the French Revo- 
lution and is one feature of the new régime. Towards the end of the 
year 1798 all public instruction in letters and sciences had. practically 
ceased. All colleges were deserted. A few national schools, in which 
officers were educated for the army and navy and for the construction 
of bridges, maintained an uncertain existence. Of these the School of 
Bridges and Roads, founded in 1747, excited the most solicitude and 
was the most important of the Government schools. But somany of 
its scholars and teachers were drawn to the war that it was practically 
 
-P-A-G-E-401
      CIVIL SERVICE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSIA. St 
inactive. These schools, however, established in different places, ac- 
complished but little as regards real higher scientific instruction; they 
were isolated, and conducted without regard to their relationship to the 
services. Finally, scholars were drawn wholly from the privileged 
classes. 
The state was in desperate need of skilled men to take charge of 
various Government works, the manufacture of guns, powder, etc. It 
was then, as the result of this need, that M. Lamblardie, the director 
of the School of Bridges and Roads, conceived the idea of a central 
school which should generally prepare students for entering all the 
more technical branches of the Government service. The proposition 
of M. Lamblardie met with a favorable reception by the convention, 
and, after a considerable discussion as to the relation the projected 
school should bear to that of Roads and Bridges, there was created by 
decree of March 11, 1794, the Central School of Public Works (Beole 
Centrale des Travaux Publics). 
Lamblardie was made director of the school. The number of students 
was fixed at 400, who should be, on entrance, between the ages of 16 
and 20. By a law of September 1, 1795, the name of the school was 
changed to its present one, Ecole Polytechnique. The school itself was 
reorganized and placed under the direction of the minister of the 
interior. The number of pupils was reduced at first to 350 and then to 
250. From its foundation to the present time the school has passed 
through a number of reorganizations. These changes, however, have 
generally resulted in its constant strengthening, until now it is one of 
the most important scholastic institutions of France. During the 
exciting times consequent upon the various changes of Government, 
the students on many occasions took an active part, and the school has 
a rich military history. 
By theside of this Ecole Centrale des Travaua Publics or Hcole Polytech- 
nique, the convention allowed to live, at least provisionally, until “the 
new school should attain an assured position,” the former national 
schools, which had until then furnished the state with engineers and 
officers for its army and navy. These schools formed the natural 
complement to the Polytechnic and the transition, almost indispensa- 
ble, between it and the public service. They were definitely preserved 
by the law of 30 Vendémiaire, An IV, which made them, under the title 
of schools of application, the complement of the Polytechnic. This 
system, adopted in the year IV (1795), has been religiously preserved, 
andin allor nearly all the branches of the Government service to which 
the Polytechnic. conducts, the students going out from it receive spe- 
cial instruction in schools of application before actually entering upon 
their professional duties. 
This has not at all lessened the importance of the Polytechnic. On 
the other hand, it hasmade it the center of the system of schools pre- 
paring for the Government service. The Polytechnic more than any

other school stands in the same relationship to the civil service as do 
the military and naval schools to the military and naval services. It 
is not merely the most important, itis the keystone to the whole system, 
since it is through it that admittance is gained to the more important 
of the other schools. The Polytechnic school is thus, in a way, the 
trunk of a tree, the separate branches of which are the special schools 
of application. In this way the following schools of application are 
wholly or in part recruited through it: 
The School of Bridges and Roads (Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées). 
The School of Mines (Lcole des Mines). 
The Forestry School (Ecole Forestiere). 
The Telegraph School (Heole de Telegraphie). 
The School of Hydrography (Ecole W@ Hydrographie). 
The School for the Manufactures of the State (Hcole des Manufactures 
de UV Etat). 
The School of Application of Powder and Saltpeter (cole d@ Appli- 
cation des Poudres et Salpétres). 
In addition to these are the numerous military and naval services, 
the corps of army and navy artillery engineers, the army and navy 
engineers, and the national marine. 
It will be seen from this statement that the Polytechnic to some 
extent supplies instruction for those who subsequently enter the army 
and navy. This, however, but relates to those positions requiring 
a high grade of scientific acquirements, and it in noi way does duty 
as.a military or naval school, properly so called, of which there are a 
great many other special schools, each relating to a special branch of 
the service. The important function of the Polytechnic is the supply- 
ing to the state of trained employés for the management of public 
works, the construction and inspection of roads and bridges, the man- 
agement of the state forests, the supervision of the exploitation of state 
mines, the direction of the manufacture of tobacco, matches, gunpowder, 
ete., by the Government, the recruitment for technical scientific posi- 
tions in the telegraph service, the furnishing of expert hydrographers 
for the construction of charts for the army and other purposes, etc. 
« Theadministration of the school is thoroughly democratic. Scholars 
are chosen solely through a competitive examination. This examina- 
tion is open to all, under the following conditions: 
The candidates must be native or naturalized Frenchmen. They 
must be at least 16 and not more than 21 years old on the Ist of January 
preceding the examination. An exception is made for those at the time 
in the army, the maximum age being in their cases raised to 25 years. 
They must also possess the diploma of bachelier és lettres,! or of bache- 
lier és sciences, or bachelier de Venseignement secondaire spécial, or a cer- 
tificate of the first proof of baccalauréat de Venseignement secondaire 
1 An advantage of 15 points is given on the examinatiops®to those in possession of 
the diploma of bachelier és lettres.

classique, or a certificate relative to the first proof of the ancien bacca- 
lauréat és lettres.' 
The candidates must also present various other papers, showing that 
all military duties have been performed, the ability of the parents to 
support their child while at school, ete. Finally, a physical examina- 
tion, similar to that for entrance into the military schools, must be passed 
before the examinations can be taken. 
The entrance examinations consist of three separate examinations: 
(1) written compositions, (2) oral examinations of the first degree, and 
(3) oral examinations of the second degree. 
The written compositions are in the nature of a preliminary examina- 
tion. They consist of a composition in French, drawing and coloring, 
the elements of arithmetic, geometry, and trigonometry, and the ele- 
ments of physics and chemistry. The examination is held in Paris and 
in the chief cities of the various provinces. 
Candidates successful in this examination are permitted to attend the 
oral examinations of the first and second degrees, which are held in 
the twelve chief cities of France. These examinations relate to alge- 
bra, tiigonometry, analytic geometry, descriptive geometry, physics, 
chemistry, the French language, the German language,’ geometrical 
drawing, sketching, and imitation drawing. All these requirements 
are obligatory. The failure in any one incapacitates the candidate for 
entrancé. 
The extensive@nowledge of mathematics required by these examina- 
tions necessitates a laborious and special preparation during several 
years prior to the taking of the examination. For this purpose many 
of the intermediate schools and lyceums have organized special courses 
looking towards this end. There are also a number of special schools 
whose object is to prepare students for these examinations. These 
schools are the colleges Rollin, Chaptal, and Stanislas, and the schools 
Sainte Geneviéve, Sainte Barbe, and Monge, at Paris, and the Prytanée 
Militaire de la Fléche and Saint Sigisbert School at Nancy, in the 
provinces. = 
There is thus here a distinct departure from the method pursued in 
the United States for the recruitment of our military and naval schools. 
With us the selection of students is placed in a few hands—the Presi- 
dent and the members of Congress. In France, owing to the technical 
knowledge required for entrance, actual training commences on an 
average three years before the school is actually entered. With us the 
special training only commences after admittance to the school.* 
1An advantage of 15 points is given on the examinations to those in possession of 
the diploma of bachelier és lettres. 
2A sufficient knowledge of a modern language other than German gives the pos- 
sessor an advantage of 5 points out of 100. 
‘It is not intended to assert that one of these methods is preferable to the other. 
A descriptive paper like the present can not go into a discussion of methods. Each 
method has its advantages and disadvantages. It can scarcely be desirable fora large 
 
-P-A-G-E-404
  376 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Another important difference consists in the length of studies. The 
course at the Polytechnic lasts but two years. This, however, as we 
shall see, is supplemented by the training received in schools of appli- 
cation which the graduating students afterwards enter. 
The programme of studies consists almost entirely of mathematics 
and applied science. A brief statement of the subjects of instruction 
is as follows: 
Caleulus.—Differential and integral—two years. 
Desériptive geometry.—Different methods for the representation of 
bodies; a study of the principal geometrical surfaces; the construction 
of models—one year. 
Stereotomy.—Carpentry and stonecutting—one year. 
Mechanics and machinery.—Theoretical study completed by the con- 
struction of models, the designing of new machines, etc.—two years. 
Physics.—Thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, acoustics and 
optics, laboratory practice—two years. 
Chemistry.—Organie and inorganic, accompanied by experiments— 
two years. 
Astronomy and geodesy.—Practical work—one year. 
Architecture.—Theory and the drawing of designs and plans—two 
years. 
Military art.—Two years. 
History, geography, and literature.—The military, political, and moral 
history of the principal nations of Europe during modern and contem- 
poraneous times; compositions on historical topics—two years. 
German language, drawing from objects, coloring.—Two years. 
Laboratory and workshop practice, the designing and construction 
of models, are required whenever possible. The instruction in draw- 
ing and designing is an object of especial care. In addition to the 
school instruction, students are also taken on visits of observation to 
the observatory and to manufacturing establishments in and around 
Paris. The régime of the school is military. All the students are_ 
exercised in military tactics, in horseback riding, fencing, and general 
gymnastics. The military training and conduct while at the school, 
however, is much less severe than that at the special military schools. 
The students board at the school and wear a school uniform. The 
cost to the students is about $200 (1,000 eee) for tuition and board   
    
praiber OE youths to Abie their time in preparing for a Ora school when but 
a small portion of them will succeed in entering. With us, on the other hand, many 
youths enter the academies of West Point and Annapolis who are unable to meet the 
requirements and are dropped, thus not only to some extent losing a year, but 
receiving in a way a stigma upon their ability. From the standpoint of the school, 
however, it would seem that the French system of preparatory schools would pro- 
duce the best results. As long, however, as the position of cadet at our academies 
remains, as it is, a coveted position, we need have no fear of obtaining good material. 
Certainly the past history of these institutions affords no ground for solicitude in 
this respect.

per year. The outfit and incidentals cost each year from $140 to $150 
more (700 to 750 francs). The school, however, is quite liberal in the 
granting of scholarships. Four grades of scholarships are granted: 
(1) Fullscholarships; (2) half scholarships; (3) scholarships carrying 
relief from outfit (and incidental) expenses; (4) scholarships carrying 
half relief from outfit (and incidental) expenses. The number of such 
scholarships is not limited. As the result of the examination of 1891, 
there were granted 142 scholarships with outfit, 1 scholarship with half 
outfit, 2 scholarships without outfit, 5 half scholarships with outfit, and 
Thalf scholarship with half outfit. 
The students rise at 6 o’clock, breakfast at 8:30, dine at 2, and take 
their supper at 9. Lights must be out at 9:30. The greater portion of 
the studies courses are between the breakfast and dining hours, From 
2:30 to 5 o’clock in the afternoon the time is devoted to recreation, 
military drill, fencing, gymnasium practice, etc. 
The school is located in Paris, on the south bank of the Seine. In 
generalitis well provided with all the necessary equipment and facili- 
ties. Its library includes 30,000 volumes. 
The position of student in the Polytechnic is one much sought after. 
The number admitted each year varies somewhat; in 1892 it was 250; 
contesting for these places, 1,715. The number now admitted forms a 
great increase over that of former years, in consequence of the very 
great extension of Government employment since the Franco-German 
war. Before that event the annual admissions were from 130 to 140. 
The Polytechnic, as we have seen, does not prepare directly for the 
Government service, but only for certain schools of application, each 
giving instruction preparatory to enteringa special service. The choice 
of the particular branch of Government service to be entered is thus not 
made by the students until their graduation from the Polytechnic. 
This choice is made according to respective ranks at graduation. In 
principle the number of places open in the Government service may be 
less than the number of graduates, but in fact all the graduates have 
during the past years had a place in the Government service assured to 
them. The following tabulation will show the various services entered 
by graduates during the past six years (1886-1891):

378 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Each year two places are reserved in the School of Forestry for grad- 
uates of the Polytechnic, but these places have not been taken in recent 
years. 
The graduates who enter the service of the land or sea artillery or 
military engineering enter the school of application at Fontainebleau. 
On entering they are called cadet sublieutenants (sows-lieutenants . 
eléves) of artillery or engineering, and in this capacity pass two years at 
Fontainebleau. When their course is finished there they are appointed 
sublieutenants and placed in aregimeyt. Those entering a military 
service other than through this school at Fontainebleau form an insig- 
nificant number each year. The Fontainebleau is not what we call 
the military school of France. That is the school of Saint Cyr. The 
former is rather an engineering or technical school, as its name, School 
of Application, implies. That. the military services take so large a 
number of the graduates of the Polyteehnic is owing to the technical 
knowledge required in various branches of the military service other 
than that offered by military training. 
Those entering the service of the mines or of roads and bridges enter 
the School of Mines or School of Roads and Bridges, where they continue 
their studies for three years. While at these schools they are named 
student engineers (éléves-ingénieurs) of mines or ofroads and bridges. On : 
completing their courses they are appointed engineers of mines or of 
roads and bridges (third class). Those entering the service of marine 
engineering pass two years at the Sctol of Marine Engineering as 
student engineers, and on graduation receive appointments as assistant 
engineers (sous-ingéniewrs) of naval constructions. Those entering the 
manufactures of the state service also receive the title of éléve ingén- 
ieur (student engineer) and are attached to the manufacturing estab- 
lishments of matches and tobacco. Those going into the service of 
powder and saltpeter are attached to the central depot at Paris. 
Those entering the postal service enter the the superior professional 
school of posts and telegraphs. 
Although the Polytechnic was specially created and is maintained 
for the purpose of training engineers and others for the service of the 
state, the school is not without influence upon the private industries of 
France. A number of the graduates usually at once resign and enter 
into private undertakings, while many who were originally govern- 
ment employés resign after some years of service and enter private 
manufacturing and other concerns. 
The certificate of graduation from the Heole Polytechnique gives the 
right to holders to contest for the positions of auditeur of the second 
class at the Conseil @ Etat, or to admission into the service of inspection 
of the finances. 
SUPERIOR SCHOOL oF MINES (Ecole Superieure des Mines). 
The Ecole Nationale Superiéure des Mines is one of the most impor- 
_ tant of the schools of application to which the Polytechnic conducts. 
 
-P-A-G-E-407
  CIVIL SERV{CE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSIA. 3879 
With rare exceptions, it is the first choice of those graduating at the 
head of the list from the Polytechnic. Unlike the practice in the 
United States, the central Government in France is directly interested 
to a greater or less extent in the exploitation of the mines of the coun- 
try, and exercises over all mines the duties of inspection to a consid- 
erable extent. The school of mines is organized in connection with 
this service, and, to quote Article 1 of the decree under which the school 
is now administered: 
It has for its object the forming of student engineers for the purpose of recruit- 
ing the national corps of mining engineers, and the giving instruction to external 
students who wish to obtain the superior diploma of civil engineer of mines which 
this school confers. 
Until near the end of the eighteenth century France possessed no 
institution giving instruction in the science of mining engineering. 
For the exploitation of her mineral resources, wherever technical skill 
was required, she was dependent upon English and German scienee. 
It was not until the beginning of the last quarter of that century that 
any attempts were made to provide technical instruction in the art of 
mining. Under Louis XV, in 1769, the acts granting mining conces- 
sions stipulated that the concessioners should annually pay a sum for 
the maintenance of a school of mines. 
The true promoter of a scholastic instruction in mining was M. B.G.. 
Sage, a mineralogist, who received letters patent in 1778 to establish a 
public and free school of mining at Paris. Soon after, in 1783, a School 
of Mines was definitely created by royal decree. Two chairs were 
established, one in chemistry, mineralogy, and mineralogical investi- 
gation (docimasie), the second in physics, underground surveying, 
hydraulics, the ventilation of mines, the use of machines necessary for 
the working of mines, the erection of metallurgical forges, etc. Assist- 
ant instructors were also provided for. 
The length of course was three years; it included theoretical instrac- 
tion during the winter, and practical operations during the summer, 
when the students accompanied the Government inspectors in their 
tour of inspection, or were placed at work in the mines. At the out- 
break of the Revolution, however, this school was swept away with 
other schools. But the policy of educating for the public service was 
not abandoned. The committee of public safety created, in the place 
of the school which had been destroyed, an agency of mines (Agence 
des Mines), which, in a measure, carried on the instruction. The cele- 
brated law of October 22, 1795, by which the National Convention 
organized anew the great public services, transformed this makeshift 
into a true school of mines. . From a school of primary instruction it 
was made a school of application. The number of students was fixed 
at 20, to be drawn from among the graduates of the Polytechnic. Ten 
private or special students were also admitted, who were destined to 
become chiefs of private mining industries. In order to satisfy the
-P-A-G-E-408
  
  380 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
conditions of this law, a consular decree, of February 12, 1802, abolished 
the School of Mines at Paris and established in its place two schools, 
one at Geislautern for the iron and coal mining industries, and the 
other at Pesey for the exploitation of lead, copper, and silver mines. 
This system did not succeed, and during the years 1814 and 1815 the 
schools were practically inoperative. 
September 5, 1816, a royal ordinance reconstituted the Ecole Supéri- 
eure des Mines at Paris. From this ordinance of 1816 dates the true 
origin of the present School of Mines. Since then the school has con- 
tinued without interruption to exercise a most beneficial influence on 
the operation of all mines, public and private. It exists to-day with but 
few modifications of its organization in 1816. The decree of 1856, though 
reorganizing the régime of the school, wrought but few fundamental 
changes in its structure. The school, as at present carried on, is organ- 
ized and conducted pursuant to the decree of July 18, 1890. 
This institution is under the administration of the minister of public 
works. Though the main object, the raison @étre, of the school is that 
of.a school of application to recruit the corps of Government engineers 
of mines, it yet has other important objects. M. Maternes d’Ocagne, 
in his work, Les Grandes Ecoles de France, makes the following enu- 
meration of its functions, which shows in as condensed a form as pos- 
sible, both the administrative and general educational importance of 
the school. The enumeration of these objetts is: 
(1) To form engineers destined to recruit the corps of Government engineers of 
mines. 
(2) To diffuse among the public a knowledge of the sciences and arts relating to 
the mining industry, and in particular to form men having the practical knowledge 
necessary for the exploitation of mines and metallurgical establishments belonging 
to private enterprises. f 
(3) To gather and classify all the material necessary for the completion of a sta- 
tistical survey of the mineral resources of the departments of France and of the 
French colonies. 
(4) To maintain a museum and a library specially devoted to the mineral industry, 
and to keep these collections on a level with the progress of the mining and metal- 
lurgical industries, as well as the sciences relating to them. 
(5) Finally, to execute either for the public administrations or for individuals 
assays and analyses which may aid the progress of the mining industry. 
In a word, the school is intended to serve as a general bureau of in- 
formation concerning matters relating to the mineral industry of the 
country. In a way it thus includes a part of the duties which, with 
us, has been intrusted to the Geological Survey Bureau of the Interior 
Department. 
To carry out these objects the school receives four classes of students. 
(1) The student engineers (éléves ingénieurs), destined for the recruit- 
ment of the corps of mining engineers of the Government, and who are 
taken entirely from among students going out from the Ecole Polytech- 
nique. 
(2) Private or special pupils (éléves externes). These are admitted
-P-A-G-E-409
  CIVIL SERVICE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSTA. 381 
through competitive examinations. On the completion of the course 
of studies they are declared capable of directing the exploitation of 
mines or metallurgical establishments, and to this effect receive a 
diploma and title of “ éléve breveté.” 
(3) Foreign pupils (éléves étrangers), admitted on the application of 
their Governments, after having passed a satisfactory examination. 
(4) Free auditors (auditeurs libres), those simply receiving permis- 
sion, on their own request, to follow a part or all of the courses. They 
eannot take part in the practical work or in the examinations. 
The school possesses a rich library, including, in addition to books of 
science, a valuable collection of designs and models relative to the 
mining engineer’s art. 
It possesses, in addition, magnificent geological and mineralogical 
collections in its museum. The school is connected with that of the 
geological survey of France, where are centralized all the documents 
and information collected by the engineers for the execution of this 
survey. 
Like the School of Roads and Bridges, the Schooi of Mines possesses, 
annexed to its laboratory, a bureau of assay intended for chemical anal- 
yses. Manufacturing establishments, the chiefs of foundries, the 
exploiters of mines, etc., who desire to have mineral substances ana- 
lyzed can send them to the school for this purpose. They are only 
made when it is believed that they will render a real public service, 
but when undertaken are entirely gratuitous. 
The first class of students, student engineers, are recruited solely, 
as we have seen, from the graduates of the Polytechnic. 
The second class, the special students, are admitted after examina- 
tion. Extraordinary precautions are taken to insure the admittance 
of only those fully prepared to follow the courses of the school. Can- 
didates must, with some exceptions, first pass an examination admitting 
to a preparatory course of one year, which must be taken before the 
school proper can be entered. 
The examination for admittance to the preparatory courses includes 
tests of writing and spelling, drawing, geography, arithmetic, algebra, 
geometry, plane trigonometry, analytic geometry of two dimensions, 
the elements of analytic geometry of three dimensions, descriptive 
geometry, physics without electricity or magnetism, and inorganic 
chemistry. 
Candidates must be Frenchmen and between the ages of 16 and 22. 
The preparatory courses include (1) the elements of infinitesimal cal- 
culus and rational mechanics. (2) Descriptive geometry and its appli- 
cations to shadows, to perspective, stone-cutting, and carpentry. (3) 
Physics. (4) General chemistry. 
These courses last from the beginning of November to the end of 
May. : 
There isan additionai examination for admittance to the school itself, 
which others than those having taken the preparatory courses can take.
-P-A-G-E-410
  
        382 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Candidates for this examination must first deposit a page of French 
written under dictation and five designs of a specified character. 
The examination itself consists of four oral examinations on infini- 
tesimal analysis, mechanics, descriptive geometry and its applica- 
tions, physics and general chemistry, geometrical drawing and color- 
ing (lavis). Candidates must be between the ages of 18 and 22. An 
exception is made for those in the military service, the maximum age 
limit being raised to 25 years in their cases. 
The number of special pupils admitted varies from year to year. 
The average number is probably twenty. 
The instruction lasts three years. It is entirely gratuitous. The 
character of the courses is designed with special reference to the knowl- 
edge required for the exploitation of mines and the treatment of min- 
eral substances. It has also for its object the study of steam engines, 
the management and materials of railroads, the investigation, preser- 
vation, and regulation of mineral waters, etc. The instruction is 
divided among the three years as follows: 
First year.—Exploitation of mines; general metallurgy, iron; ana- 
lytical chemistry (metalloids) ; industrial chemisty of the minerals; min- 
eralogy; zoological and vegetable paleontology; topography and level- 
ing; drawings and projects of exploitation and of metallurgy; exercises 
in the analysis of minerals; exercises in mineralogy and paleontology ; 
exercises in topography. 
Second year.—Metallurgy, different metals; analytical chemistry, 
metals; geology and ‘petrography; machines and the resistance of 
materials; railroads; industrial economics; projects of metallurgy and 
machines; exercises in mineral analysis; exercises in petrography; 
visits to industrial establishments, and geological courses. 
Third year.—Applied geology; construction; construction of ma- 
chines; legislation concerning mines; applications of electricity; artil- 
lery; plans for the exploitation of mines; use of machines, and metal- 
lurgical work. 
In addition, each scholar is required to pursue during the three years 
a course in English or German, or he may pursue both. 
Independently of visits to manufacturing establishments and numer- 
ous excursions and of the courses which the students are required to 
master in order to complete their professional instruction, each student 
is required to make a sojourn of about a month during the summer 
vacation in a mining or metallurgical district of France or Belgium. 
At the end of the third year the student engineers make a second 
voyage of instruction of about one hundred days in some foreign coun- 
try. This trip is optional for the special pupils. On the return from 
these trips the students must furnish a description of the establish- 
ments visited, and of the different, subjects to which their attention 
has been directed. 
The school year lasts from the first. of November to the middle of 
April.
-P-A-G-E-411

On the completion of their courses the student engineers ‘are 
appointed “ordinary engineers of the third class of the corps of 
mines,” withasalary of $500 (2,500 franes) per year. They receive while 
at the school a salary of 1,800 franes per year. 
The actual organization of the corps of mines dates back to the year 
1810. In order to appreciate the role of the corps of mines, it is neces- 
sary to see it under its triple scientific, industrial, and administrative 
aspect. The engineers are charged with the inspection of mines, quar- 
ries, sources of mineral waters, ete., with the control of the manage- 
ment of ratlroads, and the study of the geological and mineralogical 
formation of France in detail. A certain number also devote them- 
selves entirely to the sciences and to giving instruction. A few, under 
certain cireumstances, can obtain leave and enter private establish- 
ments. 
The personnel of the corps and the salaries paid are as follows:

The special pupils who receive the title of civil engineer of mines 
readily find advantageous positions in private mining establishments, 
metallurgical works, railroad company shops, ete. 
SCHOOL OF BRIDGES AND ROADS (Hcole des Ponts et Chaussées). 
Among the public services of France which enjoy a high reputation 
that of the management of roads and bridges occupies the first rank. 
French engineers have acquired just renown throughout Europe for 
their skill. This reputation naturally redounds to the credit of the 
school in which many of them have received their training. The School 
of Roads and Bridges is the most important, and at the same time the 
oldest, of the schools of application, the students of which are recruited 
through the medium of the Polytechnic School. It is this school and 
the School of Mines- which are the more often selected by those having 
the first choice of service to which they are entitled by their rank at 
graduation. 
The school is located at Paris, and is under the supervision of the 
minister of public works. Its object is to educate civil engineers to 
recruit the national corps of engineers, which has charge of the con- 
struction and maintenance of the great public works of France—the

The creation of a corps of engineers to have the management of pub- 
lic works dates from the reign of Louis XV. In 1716 Louis created 
the first body of Government engineers. The first trace of the principle 
 
-P-A-G-E-412

of specially training young men for these positions is found thirty years 
later, in 1747, when a state engineer, named Perronet, was called to 
Paris to undertake a considerable work in connection with the system 
of public works generally, and was authorized to have a number of 
young men specially instructed to assist in the work. As a result, 
Perronet organized what he called a Bureau des Ponts et Chaussées. 
Force of circumstances soon transformed this into a true school. The 
employés were divided into three classes: the first composed of sub- 
inspectors or assistant engineers, the second of students, and the third 
of candidates or young men less instructed, who were permitted to 
work in the bureau as assistants until they were appointed students. 
This, as can be seen, was the creation of a system of regular instrue- 
tion, and various documents left by Perronet speak of these employés 
as under the direction now of the Bureau and now of the Feole, using 
the two terms interchangeably. 
In 1775 Minister Turgot confirmed officially the institution which 
existed de facto. He published an instruction concerning the Keole des 
Ponts et Chaussées. Perronet was continued as director of the school. 
The number of students was fixed at 60. During the summer the 
scholars were employed on the various Government works. This organi- 
zation was productive of good results. This was the condition of the 
“school at the outbreak of the Revolution. 
January 19, 1791, the Assembly passed a law decreeing that— 
There shall be a School of Bridges and Roads. It shall include 60 students, divided 
into three classes of 20 each. All shall be appointed. 
Neyertheless, during the Revolution the school remained completely 
disorganized, and the members went into the various armies. 
In 1794, Lamblardie, who, on the designation of Perronet, had suc- 
ceeded to the directorship of the school, as we have seen, conceived 
the idea of creating a grand school preparatory to ali the technical 
branches of the public service. This idea took shape in the creation of 
the Heole Centrale des Travaux Publics, which very soon became the 
Ecole Polytechnique. For sometime it was uncertain whether the crea- 
tion of this school should carry with it the suppression of the schools 
already existing. Finally, however, it was determined to retain the 
School of Bridges and Roads in connection with the Polytechnic as a 
special school of application (Hcole Speciale @ Application). The number 
of scholars was fixed at 36, to be wholly drawn from the Polytechnic. 
Little further change was made in the school until 1804, when an impe- 
rial decree, reorganizing both the corps of engineers and the school, 
fixed the number of students at 60, to be divided into three classes. 
The scholars of the’first year were to receive a salary of 700 francs, of 
the second year 800 francs, and of the third year 900 frances per year. 
Various acts and decrees were made in 1830, 1839, and 1851, regulat- 
ing the régime and the conditions of entrance to the school, but without 
materially affecting its work and character. The school is at present 
carried on under a decree bearing date July 18, 1890,

  CIVIL SERVICE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSIA. 385 
The School of Bridges and Roads is under the administration of the 
minister of public works. It is situated at Paris, on the left bank of 
the Seine. In general, the organization and character of the school is 
the same as that of the school of mines, except as to the subject-matter 
of the instruction given. It stands in the same relation to the Govern- 
ment service of roads and bridges as the School of Mines stands to the 
service of mines. The school has for its primary object the instruction 
of students who are intended to recruit the national corps of engineers of 
roads and bridges. But, like the School of Mines, it employs the organ- 
ization, which has to be made for this purpose, to give instruction to 
others than those intended primarily for the Government service. 
With these objects in view, it admits the same four classes of stu-- 
dents as are admitted to the School of Mines, viz: 
(1) The student engineers (éléves ingénieurs) recruited from the Poly- 
technic and intended for the Government service of roads and bridges. 
(2) Phe private or special students (éléves eaxternes) admitted on 
competitive examination—a certain number each year. 
(3) Students of foreign nationality admitted on the application of 
their governments after a satisfactory examination; and 
(4) Students admitted on their own application to follow a part or 
all of the oral courses. 
The school is well equipped for its work. In its library of over 
50,000 volumes it possesses one of the most valuable collections of books 
relating to the engineer’s art which is in existence. It is well cata- 
logued. Its museum of models includes a large number of models and. 
designs of the more remarkable engineering works which have been 
executed during the past fifty years, such as bridges, viaducts, harbor 
improvements, etc. A great many of the models possess considerable 
value on account of the fineness with which they have been executed. 
Its experimental laboratory affords facilities for engineering experi- 
nents of all description, the testing of the strength of materials, stone- 
cutting, carpentry constructions, forging, ete. 
In its physical and chemical laboratory. are made analyses of all 
kinds, which are sent to the school by engineers throughout the country. 
It is estimated that over 30,000 such analyses and tests have been 
made at the request of private engineers and establishments. 
The student engineers are recruited entirely from the Polytechnic. 
The number of places varies each year, but is generally between the 
numbers 10 and 20. _ 
The new decree organizing the school distinguishes between the pri- 
vate students, who must be French citizens, and foreign students. 
The latter are now only admitted when there remain places after the 
others have been provided for. As at the School of Mines, a prepara- | 
tory course has been organized by which most of the private students 
gain admittance to the school. Admittance to this course is gained by 
means of competitive examinations. Candidates must be between the 
ED 92 25    
-P-A-G-E-414
    386 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
ages of 17 and 20 years, except for those having completed their mili- 
tary service, in whose cases the maximum age is raised to 25 years. 
Knowledge is required of arithmetic, algebra, elements of geometry, 
plane trigonometry, analytic geometry of two and three dimensions, 
descriptive geometry, the elements of physics | and chemistry, linear 
drawing and coloring. , 
Seventeen students were admitted to the preparatory course during 
the year 1892. 
The course lasts one year, and consists of instruction in differential 
and integral calculus, rational mechanics, physics and chemistry, de- 
scriptive geometry, stereotomy, the elements of architecture, drawing 
and coloring. 
Those passing the examinations at the end of the year do not have 
to take the examination for admittance to the School of Bridges and 
Roads, but are placed at the head of the list of candidates for admit- 
tance. Another examination is held for external pupils who have not 
taken the preparatory course. The age limits for this examination are 
18 and 22, or 26 years in the case of those having completed their term 
of active military service. The programme of studies covered by the 
examination consists of arithmetic, elementary geometry, algebra, plane 
trigonometry, analytic geometry of two and three dimensions, deserip- 
tive geometry with its applications to stonecutting and carpentry, ele- 
ments of differential and integral calculus, mechanics, physics, chem- 
istry, and architecture. 
The places of private students can be granted to conducteurs des ponts 
et chaussées who have passed the examination and have been in the 
service at least six years. During their stay at the school they are 
considered as in the active service and receive the regular salary with 
the indemnity usually allotted to conductors of roads and bridges 
while residing at Paris. On the completion of their courses they are 
placed at the disposition of an engineer-in-chief, to be employed in 
active service in the same way as the student engineers. At the begin- 
ning of the scholastic year of 1892 there were admitted to the prepara- 
tory course 7 students, to the school itself 2 conductors of roads and 
bridges, and 5 public functionaries of foreign nations. The foreign 
students are admitted in the same way as in the case of the School of 
Mines. 
At the end of their studies the external students receive a diploma 
eof an engineer. They usually find little difficulty in securing good 
positions in private industrial establishments. 
The instruction is entirely gratuitous, as in all the schools of appli-° 
cation. It lasts three years, generally from the 16th of November to 
the 31st of May of each year. The method of instruction followed is in 
part theoretical and in part practical. The courses of studies accord- 
ing to years are: 
First year.—Applied mechanics (resistance of materials); construc-
-P-A-G-E-415
  
CIVIL SERVICE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSIA. 887 
tion (roads) ; mineralogy and geology; architecture (employment of wood. 
and iron in constructions, decoration of bridges); political economy; 
general processes of construction; applied chemistry. 
Second year.—Applied mechanics (hydraulics); construction (internal 
navigation); construction (bridges); steam engines; architecture (em- 
ployment of wood and iron in constructions, decoration of bridges); 
administrative law (first part). 
Third year.—Construction (railroads) ; construction (maritime works) ; 
administrative law (second part); fortification. 
The instruction also includes for each student a study of the English 
and German languages, experiments in laboratories, graphical works, 
drawing of plans, coloring, the testing of the strength of materials for 
the purposes of construction, the construction of machines and build- 
ings, ete. 
In addition to the above regular instruction, information is given 
through conferences to the students on electrical telegraphy, photog- 
raphy, the exploitation of railroads, pisciculture, or new discoveries 
and important public works. 
At the end of each year’s course of study at the school the student 
engineers are sent on missions into the departments and are attached to 
works in process of construction, in order to exercise themselves under 
the direction of the chiefs of the service in the practical duties of the 
engineer. At the end of the third year missions to foreign countries 
can be given to students who have particularly distinguished them- 
selves during their stay at the school. 
While attending the school the student engineers receive a salary of 
1,800 francs. On graduation they enter the national corps of engineers 
of roads and bridges. A few words regarding the character of this 
service of the Government will not be out of place. The decrees which 
organized the corps of roads and bridges bear the dates October 13, 
1851, March 28, 1852, and June 17, 1854. 
The service is divided into (1) the ordinary service, (2) extraordinary 
service, (3) detached services. The ordinary service is further divided 
into (1) the general service, (2) special service, (3) divers services. The 
general service includes the direction and execution of ordinary works 
relating to roads and bridges in the departments. The special service 
relates to such special services as the draining of marshes, the regula- 
tion of establishments located on water courses, the canal service, and 
maritine works. * 
A law of the date of July 12, 1865, created a division of “railroads of 
local interest.” This law requires that projects of work which ought to 
be executed by the departments in connection with the communes must 
first be submitted to an examination by the engineer in chief of roads 
and bridges; and in a certain number of departments the ordinary 
engineers of roads and bridges have been intrusted with the preparation 
of the plans for the works and their execution, such was the confidence _ 
placed in their ability by the prefects and general councils.  
-P-A-G-E-416
388 | EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The divers services include the secretaryship of the council general 
of roads and bridges, the school, the depot of maps and plans, missions, 
scientific works, ete. 
The extraordinary service includes the direction and the execution 
of large public works not requiring permanent oversight, such as rail- 
roads, canals, marine works, ete. The detached services include all 
the services not specially specified, but which must, nevertheless, be 
performed by the corps, such as the service of water and paving in the 
city of Paris, the chairs of instruction in special governmental schools, 
ete. The personnel and salaries of employés of the service are as

SupERion SpEcIAL ScuooL oF Posts AND TELEGRAPHS (cole 
Professionnelle Supérieure des Posts et des Telegraphes). 
In France the telegraphs and telephones belong to the central goy- 
ernment, and are administered in connection with the postal system as 
a single service. A school of telegraphy was established in 1878 to 
recruit the higher positions in the service. It has since been enlarged 
in scope and now is divided into two sections. It is situated in Paris, 
and is under the minister of commerce, industry, and the colonies. 
The first section is open only to employés of the service who are at 
Jeast 25 years of age and have had five years of service. They are 
admitted after a competitive examination bearing upon the following 
subjects: The postal and telegraphic services; the management and 
study of telegraph instruments; mathematics—arithmetic, algebra, and 
geometry; physics—mechanics, heat, acoustics, optics, electricity, and 
magnetism; chemistry; general history and geography. 
This course is intended to train employés for the higher positions of 
the service other than the engineering branch. The instruction lasts 
“two years. It consists during the first period (October to July) of the 
history of social relations and of scientific progress; administrative 
law and civic duties; the legislation and management of telegraphic 
Systems; the applied sciences (elementary mathematics, mechanics, 
physics, and chemistry); a study of telegraphic and telephonic appa- 
ratus; the construction and materials of telegraph lines. During the 
second period (July to the following April) the scholars pass their time 
successively in the four services of construction, overseeing, and 
maintenance of air lines; the construction, overseeing, and mainte- 
- nance of subterranean lines, pneumatic conduits, and telegraph lines; 
the exploitation of the great telegraph and telephone systems;-the 
establishment of special telegraphic and postal services.

  CIVIL SERVICE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSIA. 389 
At the end of their courses the successful students receive a diploma 
of capacity, which furnishes the only means of admittance to the 
following positions: Administrators, chiefs and assistant chiefs of 
bureaus, head agents of the central administration, comptrollers, 
directors of the departmental and nonstationary services, inspectors 
and assistant inspectors, receivers of first and second class bureaus, 
chiefs of the central depot, section chiefs. 
The second section is exclusively for the training of engineers for the 
service of posts and telegraphs. There are admitted to this course 
the graduates of the Polytechnic who select this service, and others 
through a competitive examination. Those permitted to take this 
examination are the agents and subagents of posts and telegraphs 
having had two years of service—bachelors of science and graduates 
of the following schools: école polytechnique, éccle normale supérieure, 
école des mines, école des ponts et chaussées, and école centrale des arts et 
manufactures. 
Candidates must be between the ages of 20 and 30 years. The 
examinations embrace mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, and 
geography, drawing, and English or German. 
The duration of studies in this course is two years. The instruction 
includes: (1) Theoretical electricity; the management of telegraphs; 
the management of the postal system; the construction of lines; elec- 
trical measurements; practical telegraphy; chemistry applied to teleg- 
raphy. (2) Conferences on: administrative law; architecture; military 
telegraphy; optical telegraphy; pneumatic telegraphy, apparatus for 
rapid transmission; telephones and microphones; the application of 
electricity to railroads, and to the transmission of force. (3) The study 
of the English and German languages; drawing. 
Government scholars in this section take the title of “éléve ingénieur 
des télégraphes” and receive a salary of 1,800 franes per year. After _ 
graduation they enter definitely into the service as assistant engineers 
(sous-ingénieurs) of the corps of telegraph engineers at a salary of 2,500 
francs per year. 
Free private students, both French and foreigners, are also admitted 
to this course after satisfying the administration that they have received 
a suitable preparation. At graduation they receive a simple diploma. 
SCHOOL OF MANUFACTURES OF THE STATE (Ecoles des Manufactures 
de V Etat.) - 
The Government of France has from time to time taken charge of the 
entire manufacture of various commodities, and made of theirmanutac- 
ture state monopolies. Tobacco, matches, gunpowder, saltpeter, Gobelin 
tapestry. Sevres pottery, ete., are solely manufactured in state factories. 
The monopoly of the tobacco manufacture was established by a decree 
of December 29, 1810. These manufactures form one of the public 
 
-P-A-G-E-418

services which recruit their engineers from among the students going 
out of the Polytechnic. 
From the beginning there has been a marked distinction in the 
procedure between the methods for recruiting the technical direct- 
ors of the manufactures and the employés charged with the accounts. 
We are interested only in the first class. 
Until 1824 this special personnel was recruited from young men who, 
with the title of student of manufactures (éléve des manufactures) 
received an instruction in the art, under the direction of higher grade 
employés. At the epoch of which we speak, the administration recog 
nized that this mode of recruitment did not take sufficient account of 
the scientific knowledge required. It instituted, in consequence, an 
“Eeole & la manufacture de Paris.” Different functionaries were 
charged with the special instruction, and two members of the Institute, 
Mathieu and Gay-Lussac, received the mission to deliver courses in 
applied mechanics and organic chemistry at the school. It wasdecided 
that no scholar should be promoted to the position of “ sous-inspecteur,” 
a grade equivalent to that of “sous-ingénieur,” unless he had passed a 
satisfactory examination giving proof of his scientific knowledge. 
They even recalled the under-inspectors already employed, and required 
them to attend the courses. Those who were not able to come up to 
the requirements in science were transferred to the administrative and 
clerical force. ‘ 
In 1831 a royal ordinance required all the scholars for the state manu- 
factures to be recruited from among the students of the Polytechnic. 
It was determined that after the instruction received in the Polytech- 
nic, the éléves des manufactures should receive two more years of 
training in the special school of application at Paris before becoming 
“ sous-inspecteurs.” 
It is easy to understand that the instruction given in 1831, which was 
then almost entirely in pure theory, has changed in character since that 
time. The instruction to-day is almost entirely devoted to the numerous 
applications of science to the special and various processes of the serv- 
ice. This instructionof employés has brought about in different ones of 
the establishments important mechanical changes, showing the desira- 
bility of engrafting on the practical and technical training of employés 
instruction in the higher theoretical studies. The higher grade employés 
are notonly chiefs of industries asin former times, but their position as 
€ngineers is frequently utilized for the designing or improvement of 
material and methods. This instruction is the more necessary since 
there are no analogues in private industry, the state having a monopoly 
of the manufacture of the special tools and methods. These engineers 
who alone know theneeds of the manufacture, who alone have at their 
disposition the material to be worked up, are the only ones who can be 
looked to to invent or perfect apparatus, to modify methods, and con- 
struct the establishments, and, asa result, a high degree of preparatory 
instruction is absolutely essential to efficient service.

The actual organization of the school dates from 1861. The courses 
of study include: (1) Analytical chemistry and agricultural chemistry 
as applied to the cultivation of tobacco; (2) the manufacture of tobacco; 
(3) the industrial administration and accounts; (4) the manufacture 
of powder; (5) applied mechanics; (6) special machines and tools; 
(7) the resistance of materials; (8) construction. 
The duration of study is eight months. During the remaining four 
months the students are sent on missions into the tobacco and powder 
manufactories in order to commence their practical instruction. 
The éléves ingéniewrs receive 1,800 franes a year salary. After leaving 
the school they enter the following graded service:

SCHOOL OF APPLICATION OF POWDERS AND SALTPETERS (Leole 
@ Application des Poudres et Salpétres.) 
This is not a school in the ordinary sense of the word. The corps of 
engineers of powder and saltpeter includes only 36 engineers (2 inspec- =a 
teurs-généraux, 8 chief engineers, 14 engineers, and 12 subengineers), 
and vacancies arerare. These vacancies, however, are exclusively filled 
from among the graduates of the Polytechnic. When a scholar is ; 
required, he follows a course at the School of Mines, and participates in —~ 
the work at the central laboratory of powder and saltpeter. The salary 
of the subengineers is 2,400 frances per year.      
Scuoon or Hyproerapuy (Keole d Hydrographie). 
There exists, under the minister of marine, a small corps of ingénieurs- 
hydrographes, whose duties consist in the construction of charts, the 
compilation of instructions for navigators, the publication of results of 
scientific investigations made by the marine departments, and in gen- 
eral those duties which with us are performed by the Hydrographic 
Office. They may also be stationed at naval stations for the execution 
of hydrographic works, either in France or in foreign countries. This _ 
service is entirely recruited from graduates of the Polytechnic. They 
are required to have had a two years’ course of preparatory training 
before entering the service. The number required being so limited, not 
more than one in every two or three years, a true school of hydrography 
does not exist, but Ido not know how better to designate the two years 
of instruction required than as a school. While pursuing this course

NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURE (Institut National Agro- 
nomique.) 
Among the various spheres of governmental activity there are a 
number which have a more or less close connection with the practice of 
agriculture, using this latter term in the broadest sense of the word. 
Such, for instance, as the management of the national forests, the man- 
agement of the stud farm at Pin, the inspection of agriculture, the 
service in connection with the phylloxera pest, etc. Partly with the 
purpose of recruiting the various Government services, but more partic- 
ularly to create one center of higher education in all matters relating 
to the exploitation of the agricultural resources of the country, the 
French Government has established and now maintains at the expense 
of the state the Institut National Agronomique, at Paris. To some 
degree it stands in the same relation to the classes of service which 
have been enumerated as does the Polytechnic to the more strictly 
engineering sciences. In both, the school is used as arecruiting agency 
to supply students for more special schools leading up to the Govern- 
ment service. In the case of the Institute of Agriculture the prepara- 
tion of students for other careers than the service of the state is much 
more developed, and the school is not so distinctly a school preparing 
for the Governmentservice. For this reason we can not give it as much 
attention as in the case of the Polytechnic, but must limit ourselves to 
giving, as briefly as possible, a general idea of the work of the school as 
preparing for the Government service. 
The objects of the school are, to quote from the Journal Offcil, of 
April 20, 1891, to form— 
(1) Agriculturists and proprietors possessing the scientific knowledge necessary for 
the best exploitation of the soil. 
(2) Special professors for agricultural instruction in the national schools, the 
practical schools of agriculture, in the departments, in the normal schools, etc. 
(3) Educated and competent administrators for the various public or private 
services in which enter the interests of agriculture, such as the inspection of agri- 
culture, horse breeding, the phylloxera, etc. 
(4) Agents for the administration of the forests, in conformity with the decree of 
January 9, 1888. 
(5) Directors of agricultural stations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-421
  
CIVIL SERVICE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSIA. 393° 
(6) Chemists or directors for agricultural industries, 
(7) Agricultural engineers. 
The institute is composed of two sections: The Ecole Supérieure de 
VAgriculture (Superior School of Agriculture) at Paris, and the Ferme 
Expérimentale de 0 Institut National Agronomique (Experimental Farm of 
the National Institute of Agriculture), an establishment for experiments 
and researches established on a farm of about thirty hectares at Join- 
ville-le-Pont. 2 
The school receives students, properly so called, and free auditors, or 
those not intending to complete the whole course but wishing to follow 
a part of the courses. 
Candidates for places as students must be at least 17 years old, and 
pass an examination bearing upon the following subjects: Arithmetic, 
al gebra, geometry, trigonometry, descriptive geometry, mechanics, 
cosmography, physics, chemistry, natural history, physical and eco- 
nomic geography. : 
An advantage of a number of points is given to those having cer- 
tificates of bachelor of sciences, or diplomas of certain schools. 
The following table will show the number of candidates and the num- 
ber of students admitted during recent years:

Foreigners can be admitted either as éléves or auditeurs libres. 
The régime of the school is that of a day school. The cost of tuition 
and expenses is 560 franes per year. Scholarships, however, are liberally 
offered to those unable to bear this expense. Ten of these carry a 
remission of the payment of this sum of 560 francs, 6 give in addition to 
this 1000 francs, and 4 give 500 francs. There are also two scholarships 
worth 1,000 francs and free tuition maintained by the Department of 
the Seine. The instruction lasts two years and consists of: 
First year.—V¥irst semester: Mechanics, general physiology, general 
chemistry, zoology, physics and meteorology, mineralogy and geology, 
botany, mathematics. 
Second semester: General chemistry, mineralogy, and geology, me- 
chanics, zootechnie, physics and meteorology, general agriculture, rural

Second semester: Colonial and meridional husbandry, comparative 
agriculture, administrative law and rural legislation, vegetable physi- 
ology, economic forestry, study of the horse, agricultural hydraulics, 
hygiene, and accounts. ; 
The scholars are exercised in chemical manipulations, the analysis 
of earths, plants, and seeds, the management of the microscope, the 
determination of plants, the drawing of plans, carpentry, leveling, the 
the calculation of the flow of water courses, etc. Excursions are made 
once a week to interesting agricultural and industrial establishments. 
During vacation the students whose parents are not farmers are sent 
to important farms in France or abroad. The two students graduating 
at the head of the list are sent at the expense of the state to study in 
foreign countries during a period of three years. The nine next on the 
list are allowed to remain a third year to work in the laboratories of 
‘theinstitute, during which they receive 1,200franesa year. Four places 
are reserved in the School of Pin for training managers of the National 
Stud Farm. Finally, the School of Forestry annually takes from 10 to 
12 of the students graduating from the Institute of Agriculture. These 
last two schools, the Forestry School and the School for Managers of 
Stud Farms (Ecole des Haras), we shall now consider, being schools 
directly preparing for the Government service. 
NATIONAL SCHOOL OF FORESTRY—(Hcole Nationale Forestiére.) 
In no service of the State has the good influence of the establishment 
of a special school for the training of employés for the State been more 
apparent than in that of the administration of the national forests. 
For years this service had been the most inefficiently managed of any 
under the Government. Formerly it was the great resort for the exercise 
of favoritism. It was here that the influential placed their protégés 
without the least regard to their fitness or capabilities. This was prior 
to the year 1820, at which date the forestry administration was reconsti- 
tuted under a normal régime and made a special service. The school of 
forestry itself is of comparatively recent origin as compared with 
the other schools of application. For some unexplained reason, while 
provision had been made in other sections of the State for the training 
of employés, the administration of the forests had been neglected. The 
reorganization of the service in 1820 was not sufficient. The entire 
ereation of an honest and capable administrative corps was necessary. 
A deputy of the administrative corps, M. Van Recum, in speaking of 
the service in 1807, said: 
The small amount of instruction of the forestry administration is the principal 
source of the evil which exists in the administration of the forests. I speak not only 
of the subordinates but of the superiors as well, who have rarely the knowledge 
required fer their positions. 
As the means of improving the service, the School of Forestry-was 
established in 1824 at Nancy, where it has since remained. Its estab-

lishment had the almost immediate effec t of raising what had been one 
of the most inefficient services of the State to one of the most efficient. 
The school is at present under the administration of the Minister of 
Agriculture. Its object is the education of young men destined for the 
higher positions in the administration of the national forests. 
Previous to January 1, 1889, scholars were admitted only by compet- 
itive examination, with the exception made for the yearly reception 
of two students each from the Polytechnic and the Institute of Agri- 
culture. Since that date all the students have been received from 
among those receiving diplomas from the Institute of Agriculture, with 
the exception of the two places annually reserved for graduates of the 
Polytechnic. This change was made because the knowledge required 
for a good administration of the forests had become so varied and 
extended that all the subjects of instruction could not find a place in 
the two years of study originally established, and it was thought better 
that such instruction should be obtained in the Institute of Agricul- 
ture, an institution already in existence, than through the lengthening 
of the course of study at the School of Forestry. 
The number of Government students admitted each year is fixed at- 
12. The two places reserved for graduates of the Polytechnic are 
not often taken; from 1883 to 1891, only 13 scholars having passed from 
the Polytechnic to School of Forestry. The Institute of Agriculture 
therefore furnishes either 12, 1%, or 10 students each year. These 
places are offered to graduates in the order of their rank at graduation. 
Candidates must, however, be not more than 22 years of age, unless 
they have had military service, in which case the age limit is raised to 
the extent to which they have been in such service. 
In addition to the regular Government scholars of which we have 
been speaking, the school also receives day scholars, both natives of 
France and of foreign countries. This is in accordance with the regu- 
lar policy of the French school administration in regard to the schools 
of application. These students are admitted on the authorization of 
the Minister of Agriculture without any preliminary examination. 
The high reputation of the school is attested by the presence of a 
large number of scholars from different foreign countries who come to 
attend its courses. Certain governments have special conventions with 
France for the admittance of their subjects. As regards England, 
a special order, bearing date of 1867, provides for the instruction each 
year of five or six English youths whom the English Government 
desires to prepare for service in the administration of forests of India. 
. The duration of instruction is two years. The Government students 
board at the school, but the other students are day scholars. 
Each school year is divided into two parts. Six months and a half 
are employed in theoretical and practical studies, and two months and 
a half in practical field operations. During the first period, the winter 
semester, one day each week is devoted to the practical instruction of
-P-A-G-E-424
    396 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
the students; the remaining days are occupied by class-room exercises 
and study. During the shorter period, the summer semester, the stu- 
dents are given practical instruction in the country and forests in the 
neighborhood of Nancy or in other regions of France. During these 
terms the scholars visit the Vosges, the Jura, or the basin of Paris. 
They prepare reports on the utilization of forest products, concerning 
the conditions in the Alps as relating to the regulation of torrents, ete. 
The courses of regular instruction consist of— 
(1) Forestry Sciences, comprising the culture and management of 
forests, forest technology, tree measurement, economic forestry, statis- 
tics of forestry, the estimation of forest properties, and finally the his- 
tory of the science of forestry (150 lectures of an hour and a half each). 
(2) The Applied Natural Sciences, consisting of the applications to 
forestry of botany, mineralogy, geology, and finally the ethnology 
and zodlogy of animals, birds, and insects useful or injurious to forests 
(150 lectures of an hour and a half each). 
(3) Forestry Legislation, which extends much beyond that of the for- 
estry code of 1827, and embraces important parts of civil law, adminis- 
trative law, and penal law, the legislation concerning public works, 
especially that relating to the restoration of forests on mountain sides, 
the hunting and destruction of undesirable animals (100 lessons of an 
hour and a half each). 
(4) Applied Mathematical Sciences, as relating to topography, the 
means of transport in forests (wagon roads, railroads, etc)., the ele- 
ments of applied mechanics, the construction of bridges, sawmills, and 
- forest constructions generally, the regulation of torrents, the prevention 
of floods, ete. 
(5) The German Language, so as to be able to read and understand 
German works on forestry (60 lessons of one hour each). 
(6) Military Art, in order to have the necessary knowledge to 
become efficient officers in the national army in case of war. 
Previous to 1889, when scholars were not drawn from the Institute 
of Agriculture, there were a number of other courses. Important mod- 
ifications were made in certain of these which were retained. The 
courses on agriculture, political economy, general chemistry, and mete- 
orological physics, which had formerly found a place inthe curriculum, 
were dropped entirely, sufficient instruction in these branches being 
obtained at the Institute of Agriculture. 
The school contains important collections of natural history, of wood. 
and forest productions, which are utilized in the courses of instruction. 
A library contains the majority of French and foreign works relating 
to the subject of forestry. 
In connection with the school, there is also a station for investi- 
gation and experiments, the directors of which are two inspecteurs- 
adjoints. This station, which is administered in connection with the 
school, has for its object to supplement the theoretical instruction by 
experiments and operations in which the scholars can participate.

With this object in view, the technical management of about 2,600 
hectares of forest domain belongs to it, the greater part of which is sit- 
uated in the environs of Nancy. Here are put into practice the differ- 
ent methods for the treatment and exploitation of forests in conformity 
-with the methods approved by the administration. It should be 
remembered that no more expense is caused the Government than if it 
were administered in the ordinary method, and the receipts from the 
sale of wood and privileges are equally large. In addition to the 
management proper of the tract, observations in forest meteorology 
have been taken during a period of twenty-five years, which have been 
productive of quite valuable results. Various other experiments and 
investigations concerning agriculture and forest physiology are also 
carried on in connection with the management of this tract. 
While at the school the Government students receive a payment of 
1,200 franes each year, but they are required to make a payment at 
the beginning of the first year of 1,200 frances to defray the expenses 
of their equipment, and 600 francs each year for riding lessons, and the 
expenses of their tours of observation. 
On graduation from the school of forestry, the scholars who have 
passed with success the examinations are placed with the grade of 
garde-général stagiaire under an inspector charged to initiate them into 
the practical details of the service. They then receive a salary of 
1,500 francs. After about a year of this service they are named gen- 
eral foot guards (gardes généraux en pied) and have the direction of a 
certain district designated a cantonment. They receive in this capacity 
a salary of 2,000 francs and an indemnity for traveling expenses of 
from 300 to 500 frances. The grades which succeed in the service of 
the forest administration are as follows:

  Students entering the service in this way usually attain the grade of 
inspector, at 4,000 francs a year, at about the age of 42. Almost all 
become in time inspectors of the first class, at 6,000 francs per year, 
and the more favored reach the grade of conservators of the first class, 
with a salary of 12,000 frances. 
In conclusion, it may be said that the school at Nancy has fully 
answered all the requirements of a school recruiting for the Govern-

ment service. It has been very successful, and is to-day one of the 
best, if not the best, schools of forestry existing anywhere on the con- 
tinent of Europe. 
There are also a number of other schools which aid to some extent 
in the recruitment of the service for the management of the public 
forests. Thus the Institut National Agronomique, as we have seen, pre- 
pares for the Leole Forestiére, besides recruiting other public services 
relating to forestry and agriculture; the Ecole Secondaire Forestiére des 
Barres and the Ecole Pratique de Sylviculture, which prepare for the 
lower grades of the forestry administration. 
SCHOOL FOR MANAGERS OF THE STUD FARMS (Ecole des Haras). 
The Government of France has for a great many years interested 
itself largely in the breeding of horses and the maintenance of stud 
farms. It maintains for this purpose a fine tract of ground of 800 
hectares at Le Pin (Orve), a central breeding farm (haras), where there 
are from 2,500 to 3,000 stallions. This haras was established at the 
commencement of the reign of Louis XV. It was suppressed by the gov- 
ernment of the revolution, reorganized in 1806, instituted on a new 
basis in 1840, suppressed again in 1842, and finally reestablished in 1874. 
it was at this last date that the school at Pin was put upon its basis and 
provision made that the service in regard to the haras should be 
recruited entirely from this school, which itself is recruited from the 
National Institute of Agriculture. 
Candidates for the position of student must be between the ages of 
19 and 25 years. The number admitted each year is 3. External 
students to the number of 12 each year may also be admitted. The 
latter pay a tuition fee of 600 francs. 
The duration of studies is two years and consists of: (1) General study 
of the horse; (2) natural history of the horse, anatomy, physiology, 
hygiene, pathology, principles of shoeing; (3) maintenance and admin- 
istration of haras, accounts, principles of administrative law; (4) 
theory and practice of riding, harness, training of horses, ete.; (5) Eng- 
lish language, drawing. 
The students proper, on graduation, are appointed overseers (sur- 
. veillants), at a salary of 1,800 franes per year. 
The grades of the service with salaries are:

SCHOOL OF ARCHIVES (Ecole des Chartes). 
Since the beginning of the eighteenth century more or less successful 
efforts have been made by all the governments which have succeeded 
each other in France looking toward the preservation and publication 
of the national archives. 
In 1708 a royal decree created the offices of guardians of the archives 
(gardes des archives). In 1733 secrétaires-grefiers were created, to have 
charge of municipal and communal archives. The government of the 
revolution continued these traditions and required all administrators 
to take the greatest possible care for the preservation of the records of 
the governments which it displaced. A law of 1795 required all such 
records to be collected together in the chief place of each of the 86 
prefectures which had been created. Nevertheless the collections 
suffered considerably from the indifference of the administrators during 
the years 1795 to 1838. 
The year 1838 marks the beginning of a new era for the national 
archives of France. Several years before, in 1834, M. Guizot, then the 
minister of public instruction, had obtained the grant of an annual 
sum of 120,000 francs with which to make researches into and to publish 
documentary material relative to the history of France. He desired 
also to carry the work into the departments, and for this purpose 
secured, in 1838, the passage of a law requiring all departments to 
collect together, house, and classify their archives. In the same year 
the minister of the interior created the Commission des Archives, com- 
posed of the most prominent men in the field of education in the 
country. Previous to 1853 the departmental archives administration 
was attached to the bureau of statistics. In that year the service was 
made a special bureau, and two inspectors-general of archives were 
appointed, 
The work in connection with the care and publication of these archives 
required considerable special knowledge, both concerning the past his- 
tory and government of France, but more especially of the forms of the 
French Janguage employed at different epochsof her history. To recruit 
this service with those having this knowledge a school of archives 
(Ecole des Chartes) was created in 1821 by royal ordinance, which fixed 
the number of students at 12 and gave to each a small salary. A ~ 
decree of 1829 created the office of paleograph-archivist (archiviste- 
paléographe), and assured to the students of the school, on their gradu- 
ation, employment in this position in the public libraries of the state 
and the national archives. 
The actual organization of the school, however, dates from the decree 
of 1846. The school as now organized is intended solely to educate 
young men for the position of paleograph-archivists at the national and 
departmental archives and the public libraries of the state. The com- 
pletion of their courses gives the students entrance to the following  
-P-A-G-E-428
  400 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
positions: Archivist at the national archives; archivist at the depart- 
mental archives; employment in the public libraries as assistants in - 
the publication of documents relative to the history of France; employ- 
ment at the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and to professor- 
ships at the School of Archives. 
A yearly appropriation of 3,600 francs is made for the payment of 
graduates who do not obtain positions immediately on graduation, but 
are employed temporarily in works of classification, cataloguing, and 
other departments of work in connection with the archives and manu- ' 
scripts. 
Students are selected by means of a competitive examination. Can- 
didates must be less than 25 years of age and have received the bache- 
lierés-lettres. The maximum number of scholars admitted each year is 
20. - Sixteen were admitted in 1890 and 18 in 1891. The scholars 
board outside the school. The school is located at Paris, and is under 
the administration of the minister of public instruction. Hight schol- 
arships bearing 600 francs each are yearly granted to the students 
most deserving. 
The course of studies extends over three years. It is public and 
gratuitous. The instruction is in the following subjects: 
First year.—Paleography, philology (Romanic), bibliography, and 
classification of libraries. 
Second year.—Diplomacy ; history of the political, administrative, and 
judicial institutions of France; sources of the History of France; clas- 
sification of archives. 
Third year.—History of civil and canonic law of the Middle Ages; 
sources of the history of France. 
Each year the school sends one of its pupils to the Beole Frangaise 
de Rome. 
Though the school is intended but for the recruitment of special 
services of the state, it has become in reality a true school of the his- 
tory of France, and the position of student at the school is one much 
sought after. During recent years the following number of students 
have been graduated:

In 1885 the governor of Cochin-China sent to France, at the expense 
of the colony, twelve young Cambodians and one Siamese to learn the 
French language and institutions, so that they could be employed in 
responsible places on their return. In 1888 it was determined to add a 
French section to the school which had been created for the education 
of the Cambodians, in order to prepare young men for the colonial serv-

ice, the character of the personnel of which at that time left much to 
be desired. This section was opened to students in 1890. 
Its object is the recruitment of the following administrations and 
colonial corps: Central administration of the ministry of the colonies; 
colonial magistrates; corps of the colonial commissariat; service of the 
bureaus of the general secretary of the government of Cochin-China; 
administration of native affairs of Cochin-China; the personnel of the 
resident officers in Cambodia, Annam, and at Tonkin; the corps of 
colonial administrators; the penitentiary administration at Guiana and 
New Caledonia. The duration of studies is three years, unless the 
student is a bachelor of law, in which case but two years are required. 
Students pay a tuition fee of 120 franes per year, and 160 franes for 
fencing and riding lessons, which are obligatory. Forty students are 
admitted each year. Candidates must be between the ages of 18 and 
25 years, and are selected after a competitive examination. The course 
of instruction is as follows: 
First year.—Foreign colonial systems (first part); French coloniza- 
tion (first part); history, customs, and religions of Indo-China; a course 
specially preparing for the colonial commissariat service; English lan- 
guage; Annamite language; Chinese characters. 
Second year.—Foreign colonial systems (second part); French coloni- 
zation (second part); legislation and administration of Indo-China; a 
course specially preparing for the colonial commissariat service; Eng- 
lish language; Annamite language. 
Third year.—Organization of the colonies; acclimatization and prae- 
tical medicine; topography; accounts; ethnography ; practical construe- 
tion; colonial productions; legislation and administration of Indo- 
China; English language; Cambodian language. 
Only those intending to adopt careers in Indo-China are required to 
follow the courses in the Eastern languages. 
A considerable development is expected in the sphere of activities 
of this school; and in measure as it develops ‘a separation will be made 
of the studies into groups corresponding to the different colonies and 
kinds of services. 
Six scholarships, each bearing 1,200 franes, are offered in favor of 
students of the second and third year classes, 
At the end of the third year the number of places at the disposal 
of graduates of the school are indicated to them, The students then 
select their places in the order of their standing at graduation. Since 
the first of January, 1892, three-fourths of the vacancies which have 
occurred in the services which have been enumerated have been 
reserved to students of this school. 
Those admitted into the Government service are at first appointed 
to the position stage rétribué, with a salary of 2,400 francs, in Europe. 
Then as vacancies occur they are drafted into foreign administrative 
positions at increased salaries.

SPECIAL SCHOOL OF MODERN ORIENTAL LANGUAGES. 
Ecole Spéciale des Langues Orientales Vivantes.—This school has been 
created in order to give instruction in modern oriental languages so as 
to prepare young men to fill the positions of consuls and interpreters 
in these countries. It is located at Paris and is under the administra- 
tion of the minister of public instruction. 
The courses are public and open to all. But the regular students 
intended for diplomatic and administrative positions must be between 
the ages of 16 and 24 and possess the title of bachelor of letters or 
bachelor of sciences. 
The courses of studies last three years and consist of instruction in 
the following languages and subjects: Written Arabic, common Arabic, 
Persian, Turkish, Malayan and Javan, Armenian, modern Greek, Chi- 
nese, Japanese, Annamite, Hindostanese and Timoul, Russian, Rouma- 
nian languages; geography, history, and legislation of countries of the 
extreme East; geography, history, and legislation of Eastern countries 
under Mussulman dominion. 
After the first year, scholarships may be awarded ranging in value 
from 250 to 1,200 frances. The graduates who are the most distin- 
guished on account of their aptitude may be sent at the expense of the 
state to the countries whose languages they have learned, to perfect 
themselves in the use of these languages and to acquire a knowledge 
of the political and commercial interests of the countries. 
During recent years 66 students have been graduated from this 
school, of which 12 were in 1887, 14 in 1888, 6 in 1889, 19 in 1890, and 
15 in 1891. 
SCHOOLS IN CONNECTION WITH THE NATIONAL MANUFACTURES. 
As is well known, the French Government carries on as state enter- 
prises the manufacture of various articles belonging to the decorative 
or fine arts department. Among these the most important are the 
manufacture of porcelain at Sevres, the manufacture of Gobelin tapes- 
try at Paris, the national manufacture of mosaics, and the manufac- 
ture of tapestry at Beauvais. In connection with these establish- 
ments, and for the purpose of recruiting more especially the artist- 
workmen required at these manufactories, the Government has estab- 
lished at each apprenticeship schools in decorative art. 
Of these the one at Sévres is the most important. The instruction 
here Jasts two years in a preparatory school, and two years in the first 
division and three years in the second division of a special school. The 
number of students is limited to 20. When admitted they must be at 
least 12 years old. They are selected preferably from among the chil- 
dren of employés of the manufactory. After the second year they 
receive a salary of 100 frances a year. In the special school, 300 frances 
 
-P-A-G-E-431
  CIVIL SFRVICE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSIA, 403 
per year are puid in the first division and 60U francs per year in the 
second division (during the last year 1,000 francs). 
The instruction relates to dvawing, modeling, coloring, decorating, 
and the technique of the art of porcelain manufacture as practiced at 
Sevres. 
At the Gobelin manufactory students are received without examina- 
tion in a preiiminary course, where they compete for entrance into the 
school of tapestry. At the end of a year the successful ones are 
named apprentice students and receive a salary of 600 franes a year. 
They are next appointed apprentices at 900 francs and commence work 
in the factory itself. Starting from this moment until they are 20 years 
of age they follow during the winter the superior course at the academy. 
The school at the national manufactory of mosaics was founded in 
1876. Its object is mainly to educate skillful workers in mosaics for 
private establishments, as only a few of the students are received in 
the national factory, whose entire force of artists numbers but 10. The 
instruction given is partly received at the School of Decorative Arts 
(Ecole des arts decoratifs), the school in connection with the Gobelin 
factory, and partly in the mosaic factory itself. The instruction lasts 
two years. During the second year the students receive 500 francs. 
The instruction at Beauvais is organized on the same model as that 
at the Gobelin and Stvres manufactories. Scholars are appointed, who 
must be at least 12 years old, to attend a preparatory course, and after- 
wards a superior course in connection with work in the factory. 
With the foregoing we must terminate our consideration of the par- 
ticular schools preparing for the civil service of France. Not that these 
schools which have been considered are the only ones preparing for the 
civil branch of government service. Ina country where governmental 
duties are so varied and play so important a part in the industrial 
economy of the nation it is inevitable that the whole school system 
of the country should be in a measure affected, and there are a number 
of schools which have not been included in our survey which directly 
. or indirectly prepare their students for government employ. But all 
those schools whose main object is such instruction have been consid- 
ered. A large class of schools which have been omitted is that of 
schools which are to some extent connected with the military and naval 
services, though not constituting what we would call military or naval 
schools. In the United States we have but two schools where all mil- 
itary and naval instruction is given. In France, with its enormous 
standing army, and the great detail and efficiency to which each service 
has been brought, specialization has been carried to an extreme limit. 
There thus exists, in addition to numerous schools preparing each for 
a special branch of the service, schools for surgeons, for military and 
naval pharmacists, for administration of the-army and navy, for veter- 
inary surgeons, for mechanics and engineers of the war vessels, etc.; 
positions whose duties are mainly civil, though performed in connection

with the military and naval services. No little difficulty has been 
experienced by the writer in determining what schools should properly 
be treated in this paper. 
It is hoped, however, that the main purpose of the paper, to give a 
broad idea of the general system of scholastic preparation for the serv- 
ice ot the state in France has been accomplished. 
We shall conclude our work with some account of the attempt, dur- 
ing several years successful, to maintain a civil academy in the more 
restricted meaning of the word, i. e., an academy giving instruction in 
national economy, public finance, administration, and in general the 
imparting of that information the possession of which is the sine qua non 
of enlightened statesmanship. 
In many respects the history of this effort, though as yet unsuecess- 
ful in France, is the most interesting and instructive of any feature of 
the subject which we have been considering.   
EFFORTS TOWARD A SCHOOL OF ADMINISTRATION. 
In the foregoing schools the services to be recruited have, without 
exception, been such as require a special knowledge on the part of their 
employés. School after school has been created until all of the tech- 
nical and scientific branches have been more or less well provided with 
special schools for the recruitment of their personnel. The service of 
administration, a service requiring not less of a higher and special train- 
ing, has alone been left unprovided for at the present time. This has 
not been because France has not given considerable attention to the 
subject, but because the benefits, though they might be as'great, do not 
adit of as clear a statement, and because such preliminary training 
can in a measure be acquired cither in existing schools and colleges or 
after admittance to the service is obtained. 
France has nevertheless made important efforts to fill this gap in the 
preparation for the service of the state, and on more than one occasion 
it has been proposed to crown her system of government schools by the 
ereation of a special school of administration, in which students shculd 
be prepared for positions in the administrative departments and in the 
foreign diplomatie and consular services. Since the first creation of 
the Polytechnic, a school having special reference to the engineering 
services of the state, the creation of a similar school for the recruit- 
ment of adininistrative positions has been more or less discussed by 
educators and has been before the French legislature in one form or 
another. The idea finally assumed a definite form towards the end of the 
Government of July. A special commission appointed to inquire into 
the advisability of the establishment of such a school made a favorable 
report in 1847. After the revolution of 1848, a new commission made 
its report favoring such a school in the year of the revolution. As the 
_result of this report M. Hippolyte Carnot, then the minister of public 
instruction, recommended, and March 8, 1848, the Government decreed, 
 
-P-A-G-E-433
  CIVIL SERVICE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSIA. 405 
«that there be established a school of administration destined for the 
recruitment of the various branches of administration, on the same plan 
as that of the Polytechnic.” An entirely new school, however, was not 
at first created. Dictated largely by motives of economy the new 
institution was annexed to the College of France. A. decree of April 
7, 1848, created at the college for this school new chairs of instruction 
in the following subjects: French politics, private, public, and criminal 
law, general economics, statistics of agriculture, mines, arts, and manu- 
factures, public works, finance, commerce, administrative law, the 
history of French and foreign administrative institutions. In addition 
the school made use of existing chairs of history, literature, etc. 
The term of studies was fixed at three years and the number of 
students at 200. A complete organization was made and the school 
opened in that year. 
In November, 1848, the school was separated from the College of 
France. 
The school, however, had but a short life. It was unable to maintain 
its existence during the political changes of the period, and was sup- 
pressed in 1849. Though the project has been repeatedly revived, and 
attempts have been made at different times, as in 1869, 1876, and 1881, 
to reestablish the school, it has as yet never been pushed to a sue- 
cessful conclusion. 
This failure to reestablish a school of administration is not due to 
a rejection of the principle that such a’ school would be valuable in 
increasing the efficiency of the service. It is due to the inherent diffi- 
culties of the case. It is a much more delicate matter to prepare for 
the services of pure administration. In the administrative services 
the knowledge required is so various that it is much more difficult to 
determine the exact character of the instruction to be given. It is not 
sufficient to establish a school preparing generally for administrative 
positions. Particular services must be designated as ones which can 
be profitably recruited through it, such as positions in the diplomatic 
and consular services, attachés of the chiefs of departments and bureaus, 
statistical experts, examiners, ete. 
These difficulties, though inherent, are by no means insurmountable. 
The Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques, of Paris, though a school organ- 
ized and carried on as a private undertaking, furnishes a_ brilliant 
demonstration of this. 
Though, as L have said, this school is not a Government institution, 
it yet has such close relations with the Government service, that to omit 
its consideration would be to omit the description of one of the most 
admirable scholastic institutions of France as regards the furnishing 
of trained servants for the higher administrative positions of the French 
Government. = 
It has the additional claim to recognition in that it is the lineal: 
successor of the school of administration which came to its premature 
end in 1849,
-P-A-G-E-434
    406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
In 1866, M. de Malareé, a former pupil of the school of administration, 
sought, through his personal efforts and through the press, to prepare 
for the re-establishment of this school as a private establishment. This 
idea was realized in 1872, when M. Boutmy, also a former student of 
the school of administration, created at Paris the Heole Libre des Sci- 
ences Politiques. A notice, published by the school at the time of its 
organization, declares the objects of the school as be as follows: 
Asa whole the instruction given by the school of political Sciences forms the natural 
crowning of all liberal education. Its program embraces the principal branches 
of knowledge to which no cultivated man shonld be a stranger. From the special 
point of view it proposes the same object as the old school of administration. Each 
of the grand divisions of its instruction constitutes a complete preparation for one 
of the following careers, and for the examinations through which entrance to them 
is obtained: (1) The diplomatic service, the ministry of foreign affairs, legations, 
consulships; (2) counsel of state (conseil d’état), auditor of the second class; (3) 
administration, central and departmental administrations, under-prefects, secretary- 
generals of the departments, prefecture councils; (4) inspection of the finances; (5) 
court of accounts; (6) colonial employment. 
The statement of the various courses included in the curriculum will best show the 
important branches of education covered. The instruction is organized in five sec- 
tions. 
I. Administrative section.—Comparative administrative organization; administra- 
tive matters; financial systems of the principal states; public revenues and taxes; 
political economy; statistics; external commerce and customs legislation; consti- 
~ tutional law ; the constitutions of Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Austria-Hungary, 
and Italy; parliamentary and legislative history of France since 1789; the English 
or German language. - 
II. Diplomatic section.—Geography and ethnology; diplomatic history; descrip- 
tion of contemporaneous Europe and Eastern affairs; economic geography, foreign 
commerce, and customs legislation; rights of nations; international law; compara- 
tive commercial and maritime legislation; comparative military organization; the 
English or German language. 
III. Economic ard financial section.—Political economy ; the financial systems of the 
principal states; public revenues and tax statistics, foreign commerce, and ¢ 
toms legislation; economic geography; comparative administrative organization; 
administrative matters; comparative commercial and maritime legislation; interna- 
tional law; the English or German language. 
IV. Colonial section.—Organization of the central power; administrative matters; 
markets of the state; revenues and taxes; international law; economic geography; 
foreign commerce and customs legislation; colonial systems; law and administra- 
tion of Annam vs. Turkish law; French colonial legislation; history of the relation 
of Western powers with the extreme East; colonial geography; political economy; 
money, exchange, and credit; the English language. 
V. General section (public law and history).—Comparative civil legislation; con- 
stitutional law; parliamentary and legislative history since 1789; diplomatic history 
from 1789 to the present time; description of contemporaneous history and Eastern 
affairs; law of nations; history of political ideas and public thought; political 
economy; finance; geography and ethnology; the English or German language. 
      
  The faculty and corps of instructors includes twenty-two professors, 
taken from the Conseil @Z£tat, the Institute, the law faculty of the 
university, the heads of administrative departments, etc. The school 7 : : 
receives regular students, who follow the whole course, and auditors 
who attend only special-lecture courses.
-P-A-G-E-435

The duration of studies is generally two years. It can be extended 
to three years where a specially careful preparation is required. 
The tuition fee for a fully registered student is 300 francs per annum; 
for attendance on a single course of one lecture a week, 60 franes. 
A traveling scholarship of the value of 5,000 frances is offered once 
every five years to students having graduated during the preceding 
five years. 
The success of this school as a school of administration has been 
remarkable. 
M. H. Vuibert, in his excellent description of French schools for 
1892, says: : 
From the special point of view of preparation for the government service the school 
of political science has replaced the old school of administration. Since 1880 all the 
candidates received at the department of the inspection of the finances have been 
prepared by this school. The great majority of candidates admitted to the Conseil 
a’ Fiat, the court of accounts, and to the ministry of foreign affairs, have attended 
this school. 
Commissioner Chamberlain, in his report on Education at the Paris 
International Exhibition of 1878, said of it: 
Although a private institution, it is likely to be, in its scope and efficiency, tho 
great civil-service school of the state. 
The greatest proof, however, of its success in preparing for the gov- 
ernment administration lies in the fact that much of the discussion 
concerning the establishment of a government school of administration 
has taken the form of making of this school a national school, rather 
than attempting to create a new institution on new foundation. 
The good work which has been done, is due in part to the great pains 
taken to keep the school in intimate relation with the government serv- 
ices to which its instruction relates. In large part its professors are 
drawn from those occupying the chief places in the departments. 
CONCLUSION. 
It is not difficult to discover the spirit which has inspired the creation 
of the different schools considered by this report. As is the case in all 
governmental institutions, systems of administration are rarely created. 
They are a growth. Asa need makes itself felt, an instrumentality is 
devised to satisfy such requirement. Individual features are thus 
created, and the combination of these features, the system, is the aggre- 
gation of these units as they are created from time to time. The stu- 
dent no doubt prefers to find as the result of his studies a completed 
system which can be described as a harmonious whole, but in the field 
of administration this is a desire rarely gratified. 
In our present study we have found much of interest relating to our 
search, but we end by saying that no system complete either in theory 
or practice has been found. Though France has done more than any 
other country in the fitting of young men for the service of the state
-P-A-G-E-436
  
  408 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
through a scholastic training, she has not done it as the deliberate 
elaboration of a scheme previously conceived and worked out. Each 
school has been created to meet the wants of a particular service as the 
needs of that service became prominent enough to demand that some 
action be taken. 
Though the foregoing schools have not been created on a uniform 
plan, they have many features in common, which permit of their being 
studied as a whole. Though not correlated into a single system, it is 
evident that their organization has in many respects been along the 
same lines, which enables us to select certain features as indicating the 
policy which has dominated in the creation of all the schools. 
The most prominent, and at the same time the most important simi- 
larity, is found in the nature of the services which have been selected. 
to be recruited through special Government schools. Without excep- 
tion they have been such as require a quite special previous prepara- 
tion on the part of their employés. In the various engineering services 
of roads and bridges, mines, ete., a considerable knowledge of higher 
- mathematics has been a sine qua non of good services. In others, such 
as forestry, the manufacture of tobacco and other products, the super- 
intendence of the haras, ete., the duties were of such a nature that the 
ordinary schools did not, nor was it advisable that they should, attempt 
to give instruction in the particular branches of knowledge required. 
In general we may say then that France has found it advisable to 
organize a special system of instruction in all those services, in which 
a special, and in general a scientific, training is required of the employés. 
So completely has this idea been carried out to all services in any way 
partaking of this nature, that there can be but little doubt that the 
system has furnished better results than that of recruiting in the ordi- 
nary way from among those not having received such special training. 
Another distinctive feature of the system is the policy of grouping 
special schools of application around larger and central academies, as 
with the Polytechnic and National Institute of Agriculture, and giving 
in these academies all the general instruction required, leaving the 
professional instruction to the more special schools. This system has 
many undoubted advantages. For two or three years it gathers 
together a large number of students at just that age when the students 
themselves are least fitted to determine what career they are best 
adapted to undertake. The important point here is that the students 
on entering do not know what particular service they are going to 
enter. It is only on graduation that their rank entitles them to a 
choice. Thus in the preliminary training they are constantly in con- 
nection with those preparing for all the services; in a measure they 
examine the character of each position in order to make a satisfactory 
choice, and at the end of their studies are much better qualified to 
select a Government career most advantageous to the Government 
service.
-P-A-G-E-437
  CIVIL SERVICE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSIA. 409 
The third feature which we find common to the whole list of schools 
is the simultaneous instruction of Government pupils, intended: for 
employment by the State, and free students, or those desiring a similar 
instruction to that given in the Government schools. There is no one 
feature which to me seems so happy a conception as this. In many 
cases it has been found necessary to create a system of instruction for 
the education of but a comparatively small number of students. The 
system once organized, little or no extra expense is entailed by allow- 
ing additional pupils to attend the courses, In this way these schools 
have become important parts in the system of schools for technical edu- 
cation, which France has so perfectly organized. But especially must 
this practice exert a good effect on the Government pupils themselves. 
They are then not so isolated from outside influences. The danger of 
a few students taken apart and subjected to a fixed course of studies, 
becoming impervious to outside suggestions and dropping into ruts—a 
danger by no means absent from schools of this class—is largely averted, 
and the pupils, at least as long as they are pupils, are kept in touch 
with the outside world. The competition displayed for opportunity to 
attend these schools as free pupils furnishes us at the same time the 
best evidence of the high estimation placed on the character of the 
training there to be obtained. 
A final feature common to most of the schools is one which has not 
been brought out in our consideration of the individual schools. This 
is that the direction, and in large part the instruction, is in the hands 
of chief officials of the services to be recruited, who are detailed for 
this service on account of special aptitude and attainments. The 
effect is to insure that the instruction given is always exactly of that 
character which the services require. At the same time this system is 
not without its dangers. If too closely adhered to, narrow-mindedness, 
conservatism, and unwillingness to accept improvements coming from 
outside suggestions may be the result. It is not for a moment desired 
to convey the impression that such has been the case in the present 
instance. The writer did not have such opportunities of observation 
as to warrant him expressing his opinion on this point. As can be 
supposed, both advocates and opponents of the system of Government 
service schools were encountered, and this point was mentioned more 
than once by those not favoring the schools. 
In conclusion, the writer must say that he regrets that the school of 
administration established in 1848 did not have a continuous life to the 
present time. The history of the School of Political Sciences has shown 
that there are certainly a number of services coming under the head 
of administration, to which such a previous training is applicable, such 
as the positions of consular clerks, diplomatic attachés, certain legal 
officers, employés of the department of foreign affairs, statistical 
employés, etc. In these cases their duties admit of clear definition, and 
the character of the instruction to be given can not be in doubt. In  
-P-A-G-E-438
  410 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
some respects a school of administration would be the keystone to the 
whole system, and for us would possess more features of interest than 
any other one school. 
In the foregoing sketch of schools of France preparing for the Gov- 
ernment service, though I have made no reference to similar services 
and conditions in America, I have nevertheless kept constantly in mind 
the consideration that if studies such as the present are to be of 
value they must be prepared not as a mere historical inquiry, but as 
a description of conditions which may be of service to the people in 
considering kindred questions. The establishment of a scheme of 
scholastic preparation for the Government service can scarcely be 
called a live one at the present time. It nevertheless involves ques- 
tions worthy of careful consideration, and is not altogether neglected 
by those most interested in educational questions. 
As showing the views of at least one of our most prominent educators, 
I insert the remarks of Prof. Herbert B. Adams, of the Johns Hop- 
kins University, on this subject, as expressed in his History of William 
and Mary College.! He says: 
The Government is compelled to patronize institutions of learning from self-interest, 
for the reputation of its departments and its scientific bureaus, some of which are 
constantly turning to colleges and universities for special work. The War and Navy 
Departments have detailed no less than ten men for further scientific training or for 
the conduct of necessary Government investigations at the Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity. Various members of the university staff have been employed upon special 
commissions in the interest of the Geological and Coast Surveys, Bureau of Educa- 
tion, etc. This comity between science and the Government ought not only to ¢on- 
tinue, but to be promoted, especially with reference to political science. 
  IDEA OF A CIVIL ACADEMY IN WASHINGTON, 
While the National Government will continue to seek special service wherever it 
ean best be found, and while its public servants will continue to seek special train- 
ing wherever they prefer, it is not inexpedient to suggest that the Government might 
easily secure for the civil service what West Point and Annapolis have so long pro- 
vided for the Army and Navy, viz, well-trained men for administrative positions 
requiring expert service. There is in these times as great need of special knowledge 
in civil science as in military and navy science. A civil academy for the training 
of representative American youth would be as great a boon to the American people 
as the Military and Naval Academies have already proved. 
The West Point and Annapolis idea of educating representative young men from 
political districts is already abroad in nearly every State in the American Union, 
A combination of this idea with the merit system in appointment is frequently made 
by Congressmen in the institution of a competitive examination to discover whom 
they shall appoint as cadets, Tho joint system has long been established in the 
State of New York, the center of political gravity in these United States. The 
system should be taken up by the present administration, which sprang from New 
York and which represents the New York idea in administrative reform. The West 
Point plan of taking student appointees from Congressional districts, and the Cor- 
nell University plan of student appointment for merit, should be transplanted 
together to the city of Washington. From each of the three hundred and twenty- 
    
  
1Circular of Information Ne a; 1887, On the Unite States Brice: ‘of Education,
-P-A-G-E-439
  CIVIL SERVICE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSIA. = SAE 
five Congressional districts there should be appointed by the respective Congress- 
men, upon competitive examination held by the State or leading university, or by 
some other impartial examining board, one student of the grade of bachelor of arts, 
to enjoy Government tuition in Washington for two years ata civil academy, as 
hereafter described, with an allowance of $600 a year fur necessary expenses, as is now 
done for cadets at West Point and Annapolis. As at these two Government acade- 
mies, so in the civil academy, if properly constituted, undoubtedly a large propor- 
tion of the appointees would be ‘‘ found deficient;” many would resign for profes- 
sional reasons or from dissatisfaction with the civil service, but a choice remnant 
would surely be saved to the State; the fittest would survive, Even if all returned 
to their own homes after two years’ public training, the cause of good citizenship 
would be greatly promoted. 
Men thus educated would prove of great service to the Bureau of Labor or to the 
Bureau of Statistics. They would be capable of doing much of the special work 
now required in the taking or elaboration of the United States census. At present 
special economic or statistical work is sometimes done by men selected upon political 
recommendation and not always thoroughly fitted for the task required. . 
That this idea is in the air of Washington and is not deemed impracticable by 
practical politicians, is seen in the recent remark of Mr. Trenholm, Comptroller of 
the Currency, who is reported to have said: ‘It is my intention to take young men 
from various parts of the country and give them a preliminary training in this 
office; fit them for bank examiners, and then appoint them. By this arrangement 
I think I will be able to have in these positions men who have excellent qualifica- 
tions for their duties, and thus make a most efficient force of bank examiners. 
Besides, it will be the best kind of civil service reform.” ! 
The system might be applied also to the training of picked young men for the 
consular, diplomatic, and other branches of the public service which require special 
knowledge. European Governments foster their civil and diplomatic services by sys- 
tematic training in connection with Government offices and schools of administra- 
tion. The practice is already beginning to evolve in connection with the State 
Department and the training of consular clerks. It might easily be extended in 
connection with other departments and the various scientific bureaus, 
The Government commission for the civil service academy or Government college 
should not be appointed in the interest of party, but of scientific politics and good 
administration. It should be.as trustworthy as the three commissioners for the 
government of the District of Columbia, and it should work in perfect harmony 
with the administrative offices of the Government. 
'« The Civil Service Commission and the heads of bureaus.” Baltimore Ameri- 
ican, January 16, 1887. 
°The consular clerk system was inaugurated by aci of Congress approved June 20, 
1864 (sec 15 Statutes at Large, p. 139; Revised Statutes, sections 1704 and 1705). 
Consular clerks, not exceeding thirteen in number at any one time, are appointed 
by the President. They are assigned to such consulates as the President shall direct. 
At present they are assigned to the consulates at Havana, Paris, Rome, Kanagawa, 
Bordeaux, Turin, Liverpool, Berlin, London, Cairo, Chemnitz, and Honolulu. 
Before appointment it must be satisfactorily shown to the Secretary of State, after 
examination and report by an examining board, that the applicant is qualified for the 
duties to which he may be assigned. A consular clerk can not be removed, except 
by cause stated in writing, which must be submitted to Congress at the session first 
following such removal. Consular clerks hold office during good behavior. They 
" usually receive instructions at the Department of State before going to their posts. 
_The idea underlying this system is that of training young men for consular positions 
of the higher grade. One consular clerk, not now in the service, was promoted to a 
consulship; many of them have been made vice-consuls, and some of the present 
incumbents fill the vice-consular office in addition to the consular clerkship.     
    
   
-P-A-G-E-440
  412 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
These considerations are of great importance. To one not living at 
Washington a realization of the amount of purely business work 
requiring the highest degree of special and technical instruction is 
impossible. 
An inspection of the great. range of duties now performed by the 
central government reveals a great many services requiring the most 
special description of training, the possession or nonpossession of 
which determines whether it will be well or badly performed. The 
mention of but a few of the scientific bureaus, the Coast and Geodetic 
Survey, the Geological Survey, the Bureau of Ethnology, the Nautical 
Almanac Department, the scientific bureaus of the Department of 
Agriculture, and such services as the diplomatic and consular serv- 
ices, the corps of examiners of patents, etc., will, to some extent, illus- 
trate the varied and special information required. It is in such posi- 
tions as these that improvement might be looked for through the 
creation of special schools. Each year the necessity for specialization 
in knowledge becomes greater. In this the administration of govern- 
ment is no exception. The necessity for expert knowledge in the serv- 
ice of the Government becomes yearly greater. Personal aptitude is 
without doubt the first condition for success in any profession, but 
natural aptitude has need of special instruction in order that it may 
obtain its fullest development. Inthe Government service, as in every 
occupation, there must always be a difference between employés chosen 
at hazard and those specially trained for the performance of the duties 
which they are called upon to discharge. 
The determination of the desirability of special training must be 
made for each service on its own merits. It is safe to say that an 
effective school of administration can only be obtained through the 
designation of a few services, the recruiting of which should be solely 
through the school of administration to be established. Then, from time 
to time, as the system develops, additional services can be put under 
the same régime. What services should and what should not be so 
treated can only be decided by the practical administrative heads of 
the departments, and not by outside educators, however much they 
may here give the subject attention. 
The experience of a foreign nation whose system is as complete as 
that of France can not but be of service to us in considering these 
questions as relating to our own Government.   
  CiviL SERVICE REQUIREMENTS IN PRUSSIA. 
INTRODUCTORY. 
It has been thought that the value of this report will be enhanced by 
subjoining to the account of schools for recruiting the civil service in 
France, a condensed statement of the extent and character of the 
scholastic requirements for admission to the civil branches of the publie 
services of the Prussian Kingdom. Though the conditions for admis-
-P-A-G-E-441
  ae ° 
CIVIL SERVICE IN’ FRANCE AND PRUSSIA. A413 
sion to governmental service here are no less severe than we have found 
them to be in France, in neither Prussia nor Austria has the French 
method been followed of establishing schools for the special and almost 
exclusive purpose of providing instruction whereby the youth of the 
ot may be enabled to meet these scholastic conditions. The schools 
of Prussia and Austria being already under the control of the general 
government, the plan has been followed, rather, of consciously modify- 
ing the curricula of existing institutions, and of considering these needs 
in the establishment of new technical institutions. That is to say, we 
do not find in Prussia or Austria schools of an exclusively civil service 
character, such as, for example, the Bcole Polytechnique and its affili- 
ated schools; but in their place find the courses at the universities 
framed so as to meet civil service requirements, and discover through- 
out the land a large number of technical schools where instruction is 
given to all those desirous of obtaining such special knowledge, with- 
out reference to whether or not they intend upon graduation to enter 
the public service. At the same time those who do desire to stand the 
examinations set by the State for appointment to office, have thus the 
means of preparing themselves in the necessary special branches. 
Besides her ten universities, her gymnasia, and common schools, Prussia 
possesses the following technical schools: Polytechnica in Berlin, Hann- 
over, and Aachen; academies of forestry at Eberswalde and Miinden; 
agricultural academies at Berlin and Poppelsdorf, besides departments 
for study of agriculture connected with several of the universities; high 
schools for veterinary surgeons at Berlin and Hannover; school for 
architecture at Nienburg; mining academies at Berlin, Clausthal and 
Saarbriicken; and pomological institutes at Proskau na Geisenheim. 
This being the condition that prevails, it has not seemed practicable 
to describe all these schools, which would obviously necessitate a 
description in detail of the general school system of Prussia. Rather, 
it has seemed best to content ourselves with a simple statement of the 
character and amount of scholastic and practical preparation required 
of candidates for office. Naturally only the higher administrative offices 
will be considered, where the requirements are significant, and these 
as a rule only in large groups, the conditions being given that govern 
the appointments to all positions of a given character or rank, and the 
detailed requirements for individual offices being stated only where of 
special interest as illustrating the preparation demanded of a class to 
which such position belongs. - 
In the first section of the account which follows is given in some 
detail the fundamental law which regulates entrance to all the higher 
offices where special judicial knowledge is required, and in the second 
section the law governing appointment to all positions which fall in the 
higher branches of the public service generally, technically known as 
“ Der hihere Verwaltungsdienst.” In the remaining sections are given 
in less detail the special requirements demanded of officials intrusted  
-P-A-G-E-442
e 
414 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
with duties of a technical nature, and the lesser requirements set for 
subordinate functionaries. 
There will be noticed the important fact that all public officials in the 
higher administrative branches, whether they be judicial officers or not, 
are required to possess a very considerable knowledge of public law, 
including administrative and constitutional law, an acquaintance with 
the practical operation of government in all its details, the legal and 
adininistrative relations between different governmental departments, 
and, finally, a knowledge of political economy and political science in 
general. Thus it will be seen that there is guaranteed on the part of 
the prospective functionary such a breadth of political knowledge as 
will enable him intelligently to understand his duties, to appreciate his 
legal rights and responsibilities, and thus to make his efforts harmonize 
with those of his coordinate or superior officials. 
As regards subordinate positions it will be noticed that though 
appropriate examinations are set, many of them are open preferably, if 
not exclusively, to those who have completed the full term of military 
service. 
In all but the lowest positions it will be found that a period of pro- 
bationary practical service is required. Thus is joined scholastic train- 
ing with practical knowledge. 
The introductory remark should also be made that as in France, so 
in Prussia, the General Government has in its hands the control of 
material interests which require for their management officials with 
technical and special knowledge. Among these industries under State 
control are the public domains and forests, the state bank, the Naval 
Commercial Institute (Seehandlung), royal porcelain works, salt mines, 
state railways, the lottery, and various other less important interests. 
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. 
The general requirements for admission to all offices is the possession 
of the civil honor (Hhre). Those who have served terms in penal 
institutions, or have been in houses of correction, are disqualified. 
Whether a civil officer must be by birth a Prussian is not provided for 
by public law, but one of foreign birth must obtain the special approba- 
tion of the King, and in certain cases of the head of the department in 
which employment is sought. Religious beliefs do not enter as a condi- 
tion, except that those who have to do with ecclesiastical affairs must be 
of the Christian religion. All candidates must have performed the 
required military duties. In most cases the candidate is required to 
show that he has means sufficient of his own to support himself during 
the time he is preparing himself for permanent employment. The King 
appoints all officers, either himself, or by delegation. 
Since the development of the state’s service into a regulated organ- 
ism the method has arisen of selecting functionaries by means of exam- 
inations. As the complexity of the public service has increased, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-443
       
CIVIL SERVICE IN FRANCE AND PRUSSIA. 415 
the variety and importance of the interests placed under public man- 
agement have become greater, pari passu has the importance of these 
scholastic tests augmented and the standard of their requirements 
been raised. Embracing all branches of the service is the theory fol- 
lowed in Prussian administration, that no man shall receive an office 
who has not proved his mental qualifications and given a practical test 
of his fitness and aptitude. 
The examinations for different positions are naturally different. 
There is a distinction between the higher and lower branches, and 
between the legal offices (Justizbeamten) and the ordinary administrative 
offices ( Verwaltungsbeamten), and especially between the offices in the 
various technical branches. In the higher offices is in general required 
a high scientific education, and a complete knowledge of the special 
branches (Fédcher) in all their parts. In the lower ranks is required a 
common education and a knowledge of the special work in their indi- 
vidual fields of activity. 
JUDICIAL OFFICERS. 
_ For the higher judicial service (Justizdienst) existed formerly three 
examinations, viz, (1) for the position of Auskulator (zwm Auskulator), 
(2) for the Referendariate (ewm Referendariate), and (3) for the Asses- 
— (zum Assessoriate). 
Following the reorganization of the kingdom in 1849 and 1866 con- 
siderable changes were introduced. Through the law of May 6, 1869, 
were finally and legally settled and verified for the whole kingdom (the 
Rhine provinces excepted) the rules regarding the examinations for 
the higher legal offices, and the minister of justice was given charge 
of these matters. 
This law! provides inter alia as follows: 
(1) A three years’ study of law at a university and the passage of two juristic 
examinations are required. Of the three years to be spent at a university, at least 
three semesters must be in attendance at one of the German universities, 
(2) The first examination is given by an Oberlandesgericht (superior state court). 
The second examination—the ‘great examination of the state”—is for the whole 
monarchy, and is set by the examination committee ( Justiz-priifungs-kommission). 
Before presenting himself for the first examination the candidate must submit a 
petition showing (1) the evidence of the required study at the university, (2) the 
proof of military service, and (3) a short autobiography in the candidate’s own 
handwriting, showing especially the courses of studies pursued at the university. 
After the examination of the petition, the president of the court has the power to 
dispose of it as he sees fit, by consenting that the examination shall be taken or 
sending the candidate back if all the requisites have not been properly presented 
and the conditions fulfilled. 
The first examination is both written and oral, and embraces the 
following subjects: Publie and private law, legal history, and the

fundamentals of political service (Staatswissenschaft). The candidate 
must exhibit such an insight into the theory and historical develop- 
ment of legal relations (Rechtsverhéltnisse) as will evidence his thorough 
comprehension of general legal and political rights. The candidate 
must further prepare a written theme for the commission, and has his 
choice of subject from the field of civil law, church law, civil procedure, 
and criminal law. Six weeks’ time is allowed for the preparation of 
this essay, which period can be extended to eight weeks at the discretion 
of the commission. At the end of his work the candidate affixes his 
oath that he himself has prepared it, and without assistance from 
others. After this work comes an oral examination, which is not public. 
The question as to whether the examination has been satisfactorily 
passed is determined by a majority vote of those forming the commis- 
sion; if the vote is equally balanced, the candidate is turned down. 
If turned down, he is sent back for six months additional preparation. 
If by the unanimous vote of the commission the candidate has passed 
very well, the oral examination is much abridged. When, after the 
additional time for preparation, the second examination is not satisfac- 
torily passed, the candidate is henceforth and forever-disbarred from 
entrance into those classes of the public service that require such pre- 
vious preparation. 
Upon passage of this first juristic examination, the candidate receives 
a certificate from the commission. Upon this evidence he goes to the 
president of the district (Bezirk) in which he wishes to perform his 
practical preparatory service ( Vorbereitungsdienst). By this president 
he is named ‘a referendar, and with this begins his Vorbereitungsdienst. 
Referendars, before being allowed to take the second examination, 
are required to spend four years in practical preparatory service. Dur- 
ing this period they are engaged in the transaction of legal business, 
and are associated with a state’s attorney (Rechtsanwalt) or notaries 
under whose supervision they are. During this period the candidate’s 
work is so arranged that he is initiated into the practical workings of 
these affairs. Among other duties the referendar is allowed to attend 
to the duties of clerk of a court (Gerichtsschreiber). 
At the end of this four years’ service there is submitted an account 
of the manner in which the candidate has performed the work allotted 
tohim. This report is in detail and is very complete. In some cases 
the four years’ limit is somewhat shortened on account of excellence of 
work. 
The “Great Examination of the State ” (die grosse Staatspriifung) is 
given by a commission composed of university professors and certain 
State legal officials, is both written and oral, and is of an eminently 
practical character. The purpose is to discover whether the candidate 
has a fundamental knowledge of the public and private law of Prussia, 
and is prepared for practical service as a Justizdiener. Here again 
there is a legal essay to be written, and a six week’s period allowed for 
 
-P-A-G-E-445
  7 
‘CIVIL SERVICE IN FRANCE AND. PRUSSIA. AIT 
its preparation. The report’ must contain the complete exposition of 
some legal subject in all its relations and can be founded upon either 
past or current laws. If this written work be not satisfactory the can- 
didate is sent back to the superior state court (Oberlandesgericht) for 
further preparation. 
The oral examination is before three members of the commission. 
There is allowed only asingle repetition of this states’ examination, the 
candidate who fails the second time being forever shut out from the 
higher judicial service. ; 
Those successful in the “states examination” are appointed legal asses- 
sors (Gerichtsassessoren) or attorneys (Rechtsanwalte) by the minister 
of justice. 
Under the law of May 6, 1869, the minister of justice was empowered 
to issue the necessary ordinances for properly carrying out in detail 
the general provisions of the law itself, and some of the foregoing con- 
ditions which have been stated have been taken from ordinances issued 
under said authorization. 
HIGHER ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES. 
The fundamental law upon which rests the general system of civil- 
service examinations for entrance to the higher administrative branches 
of the Prussian Government is that of March 11, 1879, entitled “A law 
governing the requirements for the higher administrative service.” 
The provisions of this law are very similar to that of the law regu- 
lating higher judicial appointments, the essential difference being in 
the manner in which the period for political preparation is employed. 
The law! applies to the appointment of functionaries in the following 
branches of the service: Section chiefs (Abtheilungsdirigenten), associates 
in the “administration” (Regierung), and the higher positions under the 
presidents of the provinces (Oberprisidenten) and the president of the 
“administration ” (Regierungsprisidenten), with the exception of justices 
and technical positions, as, for example, in forestry, public works, med- 
icine, and as teachers. Also under this law are appointed certain 
functionaries under the superior administrative courts (Oberverwal- 
tungsgerichte) and the administrative courts of the district (Bezirksver- 
waltungsgerichte). Those candidates desiring to enter the department 
of finance are required, in addition to the qualifications prescribed 
under this law for the higher administrative service in general, to have 
as well, a previous practical preparation in financial administration 
(Steuerverwaltung). 
The requirements imposed by this law for appointment to the above- 
mentioned positions are: (1) A three years’ study of law and political 
science at a university; (2) a juristic examination, governed by the 
law of May 6, 1869 (ante); (3) a two years’ preparatory service with a

judicial authority (Gerichtsbehirde) and two years with an executive ~ 
authority (Verwaltungsbehorde). (4) The candidate is now named 
a Referendar and is ready for a second examination, denominated a 
_“ereat examination of the state,” and set by an examination commis- 
sion (“ Priifungs-Kommission fiir hihere Verwaltungsbeamte”). This 
examination is both oral and written, and embraces Prussian public 
and private law, especially constitutional and administrative law, and 
-political economy and finance. Upon the suecessful passage of this 
examination the Referendar is appointed by the minister to the position 
of assessor! (Regierungsassessor) and is thereby judged to be qualified 
for entrance into the higher administrative service, including the posi- 
tions that have been enumerated above. 
The details of this law are largely regulated by the ordinance of May 
29, 1879, issued by the ministry of State (Staatsministerium).?_ 
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ROYAL FORESTS.’ 
For appointment as “head forester” (Oberforster) two examinations 
are required; (1) a forestry examination (Forstreferendar-Examen); 
(2) a state forestry examination (Forstassessor-Haamen). 
The preparation for the forestry examination (No. 1) is by a course of 
systematic scientific study, and a practical service in forestry, in 
which is gained a knowledge of all branches of the science of forestry 
and phases of forestry administration. The candidate must show: 
(1) That he has taken a course as scholar (Abiturient) at a gymna- 
sium of the German Empire, or a Prussian school of exact science 
(Realschule). 
(2) That he is not over 22 years of age. 
(3) That he has the necessary physical qualifications—sight, hearing, 
speech, and muscular strength. 
(4) That he has led an upright and blameless life. 
(5) That he has spent the necessary time in service under a royal 
head forester, and that he has the certificate of that office to that 
effect. 
(6) A two years’ course at a forest academy or at a university which 
has joined to it a forestry institute (Forstlehrinstitut). 
1A lateral or assistant judge. 
2The minister of the interior and of finance has the power to decree ready for 
the higher administrative service such persons as have been qualified for the higher 
Justizdienst and have performed three years’ service as a Justitiar, or with one of the 
Auseinandersetzungsbehirde, as Spezialkommissarius, or in Kollegium; or who have 
filled the place of Landrath, Kreis- or Amtshauptmann in the Hohenzollern domains. 
*Regulating appointment to this branch of the service are the following:

(7) Besides this, the candidate must have attended two semesters at a 
university in the study of law and political science. coe 
(8) Upon the completion of these studies and, at the latest, six years 
’ after the beginning of his preparatory period, the candidate is ready for 
the first examination. This examination embraces, besides forestry, 
cognate sciences (zoology, botany, mineralogy, chemistry, and physics), 
pertinent laws, and the necessary mathematics. The purpose of this 
examination is that thereby the evidence shall be obtained “that the 
candidate possesses the necessary general education and intellectual 
comprehension to pursue his specialty with satisfactory results, wnd 
that he has laid a sufficient scientific foundation for further practical 
development, and that upon the whole he exhibits just grounds for the 
belief that he will become a useful administrative officer in the royal 
forestry service.” 
(9) If successful in this examination the candidate becomes a Forst- 
referendar, and is allowed to continue his preparation, which consists 
largely of further, actual forestry service, though the theoretical study 
is continued. This period is spent under the supervision of a head 
forester and lasts two years, during which time is kept a detailed record 
of work done, observations actually taken, and progress made. 
(10) This period having been satisfactorily passed, the candidate is 
now ready for the state examination. This test is largely of a practical 
character, though the aspirant’s knowledge of political economy, finance, 
forestry administration, and forestry and hunting statistics is also 
inquired into. Upon a satisfactory showing in this last test, the candi- 
date becomes a “forest assessor” and is now placed upon the list 
(Auwiirter) for the position of head forester. Until appointed, as oppor-- 
tunity affords, the assessor is employed upon miscellaneous duties in the 
forestry service. 
A position in the royal forest administration can also be obtained 
through service in the field hunting corps (Feldjdgercorps or Jéger- 
bataillon).? 
_The appointments which can be obtained in this way are forester 
(Férster), forest inspector (Forst-Hilfsaufseher), and such other forestry 
officials whose salary is at least 750 marks yearly, but from whom there 
is not required a scientific education higher than that of royal forester 
(Konig- Forster). 
For entrance into the Hunting Corps there is required a certain 
amount of training in forestry, together with the necessary scientific 
knowledge. The practical service lasts two years. During service in 
the Hunting Corps the education in forestry matters is continued, not 
only by practical service in the woods, but by class-room instruction, 
and intermediate and final examinations are held, which must be passed. 
‘Law of August 1, 1883, section 12.

if the candidate, at the end of his military service, is to be given a 
position in the administration of the forests of the kingdom. . 
Upon the passage of higher examinations, which are set from time 
to time, candidates can attain the degree of Forstassessor, and are 
eligible for appointment as head foresters. 
Theacquirements forappointmentas “ patrolmen” and “under foresters” 
(Schutzbeamte and Unterférster, etc.), are naturally not so great as 
those for the higher positions. These are selected according to length 
of military service, and service as “head hunters” (Oberjdger) or ser- 
geants (Feldwebel). For these there are also appropriate examinations. 
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC RAILROADS! 
The general conditions for admission to the railway service of the 
kingdom are as follows: (1) That the candidate shall not be over 40 
years of age. For the positions of station policemen and firemen and 
locomotive engineers, they must be at least 21 years of age. (2) Suffi- 
cient bodily strength. (3) School education sufficient to enable the 
candidate to read and write plainly and to perform the simple examples 
in arithmetic. For such positions as locomotive firemen and engineers, 
telegraph agents, etc., special knowledge in matters pertaining to the 
duties of such places.is required. (4) There is generally a year’s pro- 
bationary service before a permanent position is obtained. (5) Pro- 
motion is generally according to length of service and ability displayed. 
Examinations for promotion are held from time to time. (6) Those who 
have passed the higher State examination for the other branches of the 
publi¢ service can also qualify for the royal railroad service. 
PUBLIC WORKS (Baufach). 
Entrance into the higher branches of this division of the public 
service is through a preliminary examination, and two chief examina- 
tions (Hauptpriifungen). The Department of Public Works is in gen- 
eral divided into three divisions, architecture, engineering, and machin- 
ery (Hochbaufach, Ingenieurbaufach, and Maschinenbaufach), and for 
each of these the examinations are different and distinct, and the other 
conditions also not the same. 
Previous to the preliminary examination there is required two year’s 
study in the division of Maschinenbaufach, an extra year’s service under 
a machinist. 
Following the preliminary examination is demanded two year’s 
further study before the first chief examination is taken. Following 
the first chief examination is needed a further period of preparation of 
three years in the case of architects and. engineers, and two years in 
the case of machinists. This consists of genuine practical work.

The first and second periods of study are taken at a technical high 
‘school. The first chief examination is held in Berlin, Hanover, or Aachen, 
where there are examination commissions composed of teachers from — 
technical schools, and selected practical workmen. The second chief 
examination is set by the head examination commission (Ober Priifungs- 
Kommission) in Berlin. All of the examinations are of a highly tech- 
nical character, and are very thorough and exhaustive. The last 
examination includes: (1) The preparation of a special drawing of 
some plan or machine according to given data. (2) The performance 
of other written tasks. (3) An oral-examination lasting two days in 
which is tested the knowledge of the candidate in all the branches of 
architecture and engineering, and has the further purpose in view of 
determining just what special character of work the prospective func- 
tionary is best fitted to perform; whether in the divisions of streets 
and highways, of railways, of bridges, of waterworks, of machinery, or 
in the office. 
STATE MEDICAL OFFICES. 
These must have received the degree of M. D, from the medical faculty 
of a German university, after nine semesters’ study and a permitted 
dissertation. After this there is at least two year’s further prescribed 
work. Finally, there is the state examination, which is divided into’ 
the following seven divisions: Anatomy, physiology, pathology, sur- 
gery, materia medica, gynecology, and hygiene. The examination 
also includes practical bedside tests at a hospital. 
For state veterinary surgeons there are also appropriate examinations. 
MISCELLANEOUS. 
In the remaining branches of the public service, the same system of 
examinations for appointment is followed. The higher positions are 
awarded according to the tests described under the law of March 11, 
1879, governing the requirements for the “higher administrative 
service” (fiir den héheren Verwaltungsdienst). 
Where special knowledge of a technical character is demanded, suit- 
able examinations are held, and for the subordinate positions appropri- 
ate educational tests are required. Thus the principle is everywhere 
followed, that there shall be no appointment made to a public position ~ 
until the candidate has demonstrated his intellectual fitness, by a writ- 
ten or oral examination, and has proved his ability and aptitude by a 
probationary service (Probedienst). 
As arule promotion is also largely determined by written examina- 
tions, the other determining element being excellence of service in the 
subordinate position. Thus, in the post-office, the “collector of letters” 
is required to have had a course at a univérsity, gymnasium, Realschule. 
After three years’ experience as collector, he may take an examination 
which embraces among other subjects a certain amount of knowledge 
 
-P-A-G-E-450
      
422. EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
of foreign languages, and if he passes, is appointed Postpraktikant or 
practitioner. After three years’ further service another examination 
can be taken, which being passed, the higher positions of the service 
are open to him. 
The choice of functionaries in the diplomatic service lies with the 
minister of foreign affairs, and appointments are regulated by the ~ 
* general requirements that prevail in other branches of the public 
service. None are appointed save those who have had a three years’ 
course at a university, have successfully taken an examination, and 
have had a year’s service with a judicial administrative authority 
(Justizverwaltungsbehirde) or state administrative authority (Landes- 
- verwaltungsbehdrde). In addition there is also a special examination 
determining the candidate’s knowledge of the inner workings of the 
administrative methods and an acquaintance with the social and mate- 
rial conditions of the Fatherland. A complete knowledge of French 
is required, also a probationary service of one year or as an attaché 
to one of the greater foreign missions. 
Most of the subordinate civil positions under the state are open to 
those who haye completed the full term of from nine to twelve 
years’ service in the army. Yet all are required to pass suitable exam- 
inations and to perform a probationary. service, except in the cases of 
those positions where the work is of a purely mechanical character. 
Those upon the retired or invalid military list are also eligible to posi- 
tions suitable to their physical capabilities. The right to appointment 
upon the police force (gendarmerie) is regulated by the following con- 
ditions: (1) Nine years’ service in the army; (2) unstained reputation 
for truth, morality, and honesty; (3) bodily strength; (4) passage of 
an examination. This examination includes a ready reading and writ- 
ing knowledge of German script in the German or Latin letters, mental 
arithmetic, writing according to dictation, and two short essays upon 
suggested topics. Following the examination is in most cases a period 
of probationary service before a permanent position is awarded. 
The system of examinations for public-school teachers is carried out in 
detail, strict educational tests being required for appointment. In 
all the higher grades only those are allowed to present themselves for 
examination who have certificates of attendance at a university and 
‘gymnasium. It has not been thought advisable to detail the different 
~ subjects embraced in the examinations, which naturally vary accord- 
ing to the position to be filled.

  CHAPTER XII. 
EDUCATION IN SWEDEN, 
GENERAL VIEW OF THE SYSTEM. | 
The report of the Commissioner of Education for the year 1888-89 
contained a statement of the system of education in Sweden in extenso. 
The general features of the system are here reproduced, with addi-_ 
tional information received since that date. 
The early history of both elementary and secondary schools may be 
traced in Sweden to the Reformation period, although the most earnest 
effort to establish people’s schools dates from 1640, when it was decreed 
that a school be established in each city. In 1649 a division into 
people’s and higher schools was made, and in 1686 the Government was 
called upon to aid the peasantry through state subsidies for school 
purposes. The impossibility of supporting a sufficient number of sta- _ 
tionary schools for the people was soon demonstrated, and till 1786 the 
ambulatory school was deemed the only means of bringing children 
under the jurisdiction of a teacher, who himself was oftentimes hardly — 
fitted for such a position. 
The influence of the church over the school is a speciai feature in 
Swedish educational history and many of the secondary or “learned” 
schools, which date from the time of Gustavus Adolphus, were under 
control of the clergy, and by law of 1724, no one outside of the diocese 
could be employed as teacher. A distinct division into classical and 
nonclassical schools was made in 1820, but, as the result of prolonged 
discussions, a reuniting of “learned” schools and gymnasia was accom- 
plished in 1845. The burgher school and the ancient triviwn, or Real 
school, have, in one form or another, been in existence two hundred years; 
from 1807 the course of study in the trivium tended towards training 
for practical life; in 1849 the two classes of schools were united. In 
the year 1824 the Bell-Lancaster, or monitorial system was introduced, - 
and the year 1842 was notable for an entire reorganization of the school 
system. As it now stands the system embraces the ambulatory school, 
in sparsely settled districts; the preparatory divisions (smaskolor) lead- 
ing to the stationary schools of each district or parish; the normal schools 
of each chief town of the diocese; the higher elementary schools (since 
1858) of villages and districts heen more than 60 pupils; the secondary

schools, consisting of classical and modern schools (gymnasia and Real 
schools) which adinit pupils from 9 years of age on; the universities, 
technical schools of higher and lower grade, agricultural, military, nav- 
igation, and medical schools. Illiteracy is almost unknown in Sweden, 
the very latest data showing that among the conscripts mustered there 
were only 0.27 per cent who were unable to read. Education in Sweden 
is essentially a concern of the state; the church, too, exercises super- 
vision, for the local school boards are expected to submit their reports 
to the bishops and consistory; the inspectors are often clergymen and so 
are the chairmen of the district or parish councils. There are central 
boards of officials connected with the different ministries, and in connec- 
tion with the ministry of ecclesiastical affairs there aretwo divisions—the 
one having charge of elementary schools, the other of secondary schools, 
and there are special inspectors who take charge of elementary schools 
in each diocese. Every school district has its school board—to which 
women are eligible for membership—for the superintendence of ele- 
mentary schools, and there is also a council of teachers for secondary in- 
stitutions, subject to the bishop or ephor of thediocese. Normal schools 
are directly supervised by the diocesan authorities, but all these grades 
of schools, through the system of inspection, are brought into direct com- 
munication with the central authorities, who in turn report to the King. 
Elementary schools are maintained by the parish, but since 1842 state 
subsidies are given for the payment of part of the teacher’s salary and 
for the purchase of school material. The state maintains secondary 
and normal schools, and there are special subsidies for technical and 
Sléjd training. The cities of Stockholm, Giteborg, Malmé, Jénképing, 
and Norrkiéping have special laws governing their schools. 
Swedish children are expected to be in school! from the seventh to 
the fourteenth year of age, and instruction is obligatory after the age of 
9 years is reached, and it is also nominally free of charge. The average 
school year is thirty-six weeks. 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The stationary and ambulatory schools, with their preparatory divis- 
ions (fasta folkskolor, flyttande folkskolor, and smiskolor), serve’ the 
purpose of giving an elementary education to children of school age in 
Sweden. As far as possible with the mountainous condition of the 
country there is intended to be a aoun class central school of this grade, 
Digegraing to law of 1881, which is still in ore serine the eerie of 
minors at factory work, manual labor, and other trades, children of 12 years of age 
are permitted in craft and factory labor if they have acquired the lowest standard 
of instruction of the people’s school. The period of labor for children to 14 years of 
age is six hours; for children from 14 to 18 years ten hours a day; night work for 
children is prohibited. The observance of the law is controlled by the communal 
authorities.

with a general grouping of smaller schools around. When this plan 
ean not be earried out the ambulatory school fills its purpose, and 
lower grade schools or preparatory divisions give the first impetus to 
the child’s education. Where six-class schools are found the lowest 
classes are uswally under the instruction of a woman teacher, who may 
be considered to be more in sympathy with the little children of from 7 
to 9 years of age. 
For the young people of agricultural districts who have passed the 
school age, but who wish to obtain practical information which will be 
generally useful to them, there are the hiégre folkskolor, which in 1891 
numbered 25, with 927 pupils—men 622, women 305. Institutions for 
giving elementary instruction to working men have sprung into exist- 
ence within the last few years. Due at first to private initiative, they 
were found to be of so much value that the state has appointed higher 
grade teachers to take charge of the instruction. 
In each school district the elementary grades are under the airca sur- 
veillance of the school board or council, presided over by the pastor of — 
the parish. This board formulates regulations appertaining to instruc- 
tion, discipline, days and hours of study. It also endeavors to 
organize a parish library suited to the needs of the schools and it 
attends to the rental or construction of suitable buildings for school 
purposes—each building to be well ventilated, surrounded by a garden 
in which horticulture and arboriculture may be taught. The board also 
has to make annual report to the diocesan authorities as to the status 
of education in the district. 
In 1889 the number of children who were of school age was 764,909: 
boys, 388,539; girls, 376,370, that is, 16 per cent of the population; the 
  number of pupils who were under instruction was 715,878; those who 2 
had already left school after examination, 23,847. Hence we obtain 
the number 739,725, or 96 per cent of school age who were receiving or — 
had received instruction. In 1891 out of 777,610 children of school 
age there were but 26,574 not availing tirecinelaos of tuition, either 
on account of illness, physical defects, or other causes. Besides 
these there were 29,803 who had completed the required course in the 
ee and were thus exempt from further tuition. Of the remaining 
721,233 ghildren 656,947 received instruction in the elementary grades, 
16,232 in private schools (13,470 in either secondary or technical schools, 
hence are not really to be included under this head), and 34,284 in their 
own homes, but under control of school boards. A child can not be 
admitted into school without a certificate of vaccination unless he has 
had small pox; all children are to be vaccinated before they are 2 years 
of age. In the primary schools coeducation is usual, although in some 
of the higher classes in the large towns boys and girls are instructed 
separately.

  426. EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
THE TEACHER AND THE GENERAL PLAN OF TEACIING. 
The following conditions are required of those who desire to obtain 
a position as instructor in primary schools: The candidate must be 20 
years of age, of good standing morally and religiously, have a normal 
school diploma, and be selected for the position by tlie school board 
from the candidates decided upon by the consistory of the diocese. 
' University study, graduation diplomas from the normal schools, and 
attendance at a practice course in the normals are required of those 
desiring to teach in higher grade schools. Regular teachers receive 
at least $160 a year ($188 after five years), with a small plot of land, 
lodging, fuel, fodder for a cow; this amount is increased in towns and 
cities to between $300 and $500, but in such case free lodging is not 
given, nor other material assistance. Pensions are accorded to all 
teachers, their widows and children. 
There are 12 normal schools—7 for men and 5 for women—with a 
~four years’ course in each. The studies, which include among other 
branches, pedagogy and methods, gymnastics, horticulture, music and 
singing occupy thirty-four hours a week each in the first and sécond 
classes, thirty-three and twenty-six in the third and fourth classes. 
Six hours in the third and sixteen in the fourth class are devoted 
to practice teaching. In 1891 there were 470 men under instruction, 
133 of whom had a diploma, and 361 women, of whom 145 had a 
diploma. 
The Swedes have endeavored not to encumber the primary school 
program with too many studies, the main effort seeming to be to give 
instruction tending to prepare for a practical life The school board 
arranges as to duration of studies in the distriet over which it has con- 
trol. Itis expected that there will be at least an eight months’ school 
and that the sehool-day be from five to six hours in length. In the 
two preparatory classes the maximum is five hours a day; in the primary 
school proper it is six hours. After each lesson the pupils have ten to 
fifteen minutes recreation—that is, fifty minutes of work, ten or more of 
recreation; during one recess lunch is partaken of. This regularity is 
due to Mr. Meijerberg,? former inspector of primary schools in Stock- 
holm, who during his twenty-five years in that position made many 
improvements along pedagogical lines. In rural districts instgyction is 
given five days of the week and Saturday is reserved for manual train- 
‘ing or Sléjd in some form; in other. localities from four to six hours a 
week are devoted to Sléjd. 
In the early part of 1891 a bill was passed by Parliament by which a new subject, 
that of the effects of alcoholic drink on the human organism, was to be introduced 
in the schools. 
*Carl Jonas Meijerberg was born on October 8, 1816, in Brumflo-Jiimtland. He 
was educated at Upsala; became a school inspector at Bohusliin in 1861, thence to 
Stockholm in 1863, where during his years as inspector he saw the schools increase 
from 59 to 480, teachers from 60 to 500, pupils from 2,500 to 16,000. Mr. Meijerberg 
was Swedish Commissioner to the Philadelphia Exhibition in 1876.

  TRAINING IN SLOuD. ! 
Sweden occupies an important position in a movement which, during 
the past twenty years, has made manual labor a factor in all national 
education, a movement directed against the old-fashioned one-sided 
system of mental overwork. The great interest in such movement 
manifested by many persons led to the introduction of Sléjd in the 
Swedish schools; definite steps were also taken in the early seven- 
ties to establish special schools for a similar purpose. At first indi- 
viduals, provincial councils, and agricultural societies supported the 
work, but in 1877 Parliament voted $4,000 per annum for advancing 
Sléjd instruction, which amount was increased to $30,000 in 1891, in 
addition to that which was given by provincial councils, agricultural 
societies, and parish authorities. The schools receiving the benefit of 
governmental stipends increased as follows:

377 | 1, 278 
463 | 1,392 
584 || 1, 492       
    As many schools are not aided by governmental subsidies it is con- 
sidered that the number reaches about 1,800 in all. Sléjd is only obli- 
gatory in a few schools, but is generally encouraged by inspectors-of 
the public schools and by special examiners. 
The “Swedish Sléjd system” is that form of Sléjd worked out at 
the Niiis Normal College, or Seminary, which is a private institution 
1 Described by O. Salomon, director of the Sléjd Seminary at , in “Swedish _ 
Catalogue, 11, Statistics prepared by Dr>L6fstrém for the World’s Columbian Expo- 
sition at Chicago in 1893.”

‘founded and maintained by August Abrahamson, near Géteborg. 
Many of the teachers of this branch in the public schools are graduates 
therefrom, and hence have introduced this form of manual work, 
although no particular system is enforced in the schools. Instruction 
at Nits is gratis. It consists of lectures and discussions concerning 
the methods, system, and history of educational Sléjd, and also the 
making of a series of models in wood. There are now four courses a 
. year at this Seminary, of six weeks’ duration each, attended by 270 
students. From 1875 to 1892 there were 1,808 teachers on the rolls. 
The aim of educational Sléjd is not so much to impart technical skill 
as to develop certain powers, physical, moral, and mental; to increase 
the pupil’s love for work, his love for independence, and to strengthen his 
physical powers; to teach precision, cleanliness, order, and attention, 
and to give him a knowledge of the value of manual labor. The 
Swedish system has limited itself in a measure to Sléjd-carpentry, 
~ although in some of the Swedish public schools instruction is given 
in paper and metal-Sloéjd, wood-turning and wood-carving; it is 
intended for children between ten and fourteen years of age. Under 
the Sléjd system small objects or models are made, and the so-called 
- “form-work” offers opportunity for the development of. the eye, for it 
becomes in reality a modeling in wood, which like that in clay or wax 
is a complement to free-hand drawing. In Sléjd-training the knife, the 
ax, the spoke-shave, and the shave-iron are used, the knife being 
especially characteristic of Sléjd. The positions and movements 
required in Sléjd exercises unite it in a measure with gymnastics, so that 
specialists in both lines have aided each other materially in producing 
a series of exercises which insure a harmonious development of the body. 
The pupil is made to use the tools in Sléjd alternately with the right and 
left hand, so that the muscles of both sides of the body are equally 
exercised. Thoroughness is one of the requisites of Sléjd-training, 
and the pupil is expected to work not only witlf exactness but with 
independence of reflection and execution. He is taught to think about 
what he is doing, and the teacher is not allowed to put his hands to 
the work, so that habits of self-reliance are also inculeated. 
The Niiiis series of exercises are 88 in number, and the intention is 
to have the models combine practical utility and esthetic form. The 
pupil is taught to make objects which are useful at home, and as the 
natural development of the individual is the chief aim, all artificial 
eompetition is to be assiduously avoided. The methods employed in 
teaching Sléjd according to the Niiis system have made this phase of 
“teaching” in the primary schools a most attractive one, and the same 
system has already been introduced in three or more normal schools. 
Girls are not neglected in this kind of training, although the skilled   
handiwork takes a different form. The aim of the instruction in fem- : 
inine Sléjd (as described by Miss Hulda Lundin, who is the inspect- 
ress of feminine sléjd in the Stockholm schools, and who has made 
 
-P-A-G-E-457
EDUCATION IN SWEDEN. é 429 
this almost a life work) is, as stated in the prospectus, to exercise hand © 
and eye, to quicken the power of thought, to strengthen love of order, 
to develop independence, to inspire respect for carefully andintelligently 
executed work, and at the same time to prepare gitls for the execution 
of their domestic duties. Miss Lundin states that the desired results 
may be reached by practical demonstration of the subject, by progres- 
sive order with regard to the exercises, and class instruction. The 
practical demonstration is accomplished by means of a sewing-frame; in 
knitting, by means of large wooden needles and colored balls of yarn; 
by blackboard drawings. Progress from the simple to the complex may 
be best observed by a study of the work in the class divisions in the — 
public schools of Stockholm with girls from 7 to 14 years of age. There 
are seven standards: in the first, two hours a week instruction in 
needle-work is given; in the second, third, and fourth standards, four 
hours a week; in the fifth and sixth standards, five hours; in the sev- 
enth, six hours a week. Standard I covers plain knitting; I, plain 
knitting, and practice in different kinds of stitches, such as running- 
stitching, hemming, and overcasting; III,,simple darning on canvas, 
making aprons; IV, plain and purl knitting, plain sewing; V, knit- 
ting stockings, drawing patterns, and cutting out undergarments; VI, 
patching on colored material, stocking-darning, making button holes, 
and making thread buttons, sewing on tapes, hooks, and eyes; drawing 
patterns and cutting out undergarments; VII, fine darning and mark- 
ing, drawing dress patterns, cutting out of articles mentioned under II- 
TV, cutting and making dresses. The models are frequently drawn 
upon the blackboard by the teacher in charge of feminine Sl6jd; the girls 
receive the materials necessary for the work, and they copy the designs 
furnished, the teacher simply overseeing them to see that the ideas are 
properly carried out. In the lowest classes the ordinary teacher carries 
out the so-called Lundin method, but in the higher-grade primaries 
there are special teathers employed for the teaching of feminine skilled 
handiwork. There are 14 courses or standards before completion of 
this class of work, and a series of models is found in each school, in” 
addition to those in charge of the inspectress of feminine Sléjd. The 
pupils receive the work done in standards I to VI, II to XIII free of 
charge, and in the other standards only have to pay for the thread, 
material furnished, ete. 
THE SCHOOLS OF STOCKHOLM. ! 
The school laws are the same for all parts of Sweden and yet, as 
heretofore stated, there are city schools which are governed somewhat 
differently from those of the country at large. For this reason the 
organization of the Stockholm schools is here presented. The num- 
ber of districts or parishes in Stockholm is eight, each parish has its 
school, and its school council appointed by the inhabitants. In the 
1 Revue Pédagogique, October, 1893. 
 
-P-A-G-E-458
  
    430 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
rural districts the conformation of the country requires, in general, the 
establishment of various schools; in the city a parish may have its 
one educational center with all grades under one roof, or whenever 
there are as many as 4,000 pupils in a single parish a subdivision 
is made~ by which the preparatory divisions, or smaskolor, were 
in separate buildings regarded as annexes to the central school. 
“A central school board or higher council, composed of a dozen mem- 
bers, including one member from each of the eight subsidiary coun- 
cils, a member appointed by the administrative authorities, a phy- 
sician, and a member of the consistory, has the general control of 
school affairs. The school board of each parish is presided over by a 
clergyman; its duties are to keep the school buildings up to the 
‘proper standard, to watch over the school attendance, and to suggest 
to the central board what reforms are needed. All expenditures are 
decided by the central board; the parish board proposes the candi- 
dates for teachers, the central board appoints them; the central board ~ 
also appoints an inspector who submits to it the most important ques- 
tions appertaining to elementary education. It is noticeable that the 
central board has the controlling voice in Stockholm school affairs, 
while the parish boards are subordinate to it. 
The school year is of forty-one weeks, from August 15 to December 
- 20 and from January 8toJune 15. The school day is from 8 to 1 o’clock, 
or a five hours’ period. The youngest children have four hours.. In 
all there are sixty minutes’ recreation, three times amounting to ten 
minutes each, with a thirty minutes’ period for lunch. Each class has 
its own instructor or instructress who teaches the different branches 
and supervises the discipline of that class. The highest classes, 
however, have special teachers for singing, drawing, and feminine Sléjd. 
Mr. Meijerberg brought women teachers into the corps of instructors, 
an innovation which has had noticeable results, as far as the training 
-of the youngest pupils is concerned, and to-day there are five women 
teachers to one man in the teaching corps of Stockholm schools. In 
the lower classes especially the woman teacher is preeminent, as well 
as in the classes for girls. If she has shown herself to be a good- dis- 
ciplinarian there is no hesitancy in placing her in charge of the classes 
for boys of 10 to 12 years of age. In leaving the schoolroom for 
recreation the children march two by two, and a‘monitor chosen from 
the ranks, keeps order; in leaving for home after school hours the chil- 
dren are formed into squads, according to the district, a corporal has 
the squad-in charge and each boy drops out near his home. The 
course of study differs only in extent from that given for the same 
grade of school throughout Sweden. In history, for instance, class 
three has ancient history, class four, the history of Sweden from 1060 
to 1611; class five, from 1611 to 1818; class six, from 1818 to the 
present with a repetition of ancient history and that of the Middle 
Ages; class seven, repetition of history since the Reformation, also 
universal history. :

Slojd instruction has already been touched upon under that head- oe 
ing. The schools of Stockholm have 92 men and 431 women as regular 
teachers, all of whom have normal school diplomas, and each one of 
whom gives thirty hours’ instruction a week. At the head of each 
school is a director who gives from eight to a dozen hours instruction 
a week. Special teachers number 14 (7 men and 7 women) for singing 5 
and drawing, and 16 teachers for feminine Sléjd. The salaries are grad- 
uated as follows: i

The director (or principal) receives in addition to his salary a supple- 
mentary amount which varies according to the number of pupilsin school, 
from 500 to 1,300 crowns ($134 to $348). 
The number of pupils in Stockholm schools is about 20,000 (20,312 
in 1892);! in 1862 there were only 2,500. In 1890 the proportions of — 
absentees from various causes were: Sickness, 4-9 per cent; no causes 
assigned, 2 per cent; lack of shoes or garments, 0-7 per cent; author- : 
ized absence, 3 per cent. This last enumeration comprises the chil- 
dren who are required to be at home to care for younger children, or who, 
during the warm season are sent into the country for their health. In- 
1890 there were 1,800 pupils in night schools, their services being required 
during the day by their parents. 
The authorities attend to the school attendance, requiring the own- 
ers or landlords of houses to furnish the police with information a 
(presented on January 1 of each year) regarding the age, profession, 
or trade of their tendnts. The police registers have consequently de- 
tailed knowledge of the people. The principal of each elementary school 
obtains from this source the number of persons of school age in his dis- 
trict, and information being also furnished as to the attendance at < 
private schools, the necessary measures are taken for school attendance. "

to know wherein the variance lies. 
That is, the sum of $320,392 was spent for the Stockholm schools, 
the Government contributing $58,156 towards that amount. 
~ The new school buildings are most luxuriously arranged; particularly | 
is this said to be the case with the Frederic Adolphus and the Catha- 
rine schools, which resemble museums in their inner decorations. Each 
pupil has a separate desk, and neatness is observable everywhere, not 
the slightest ink spot being visible to the casual observer. The build- 
ings are several stories high, all class rooms open upon the same broad 
corridor, the windows being at the opposite sides. Bath rooms are so 
arranged that more than 4,500 pupils can be bathed every two days, 
each pupil receiving a douche and a warm-air bath. In all the par- 
ishes the poorest school children receive free dinner. In the Catharine 
"parish 200 boys dine at school on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, 
and 200 girls the intermediate days. The extremely impoverished 
receive also a glass of warm milk and a bit of bread. Cooking schools 
or classes are connected with some of the schools; in these regular 
instruction is given in simple diet. 
Vacation colonies (due to Mr. Meijerberg’s initiative), comprising each 
from 20 to 30 pupils, and in charge of a society with the princess royal 
as president, are sent into rural districts, near the sea if possible, during 
the vacation period, between June 15 and August 15. Each group 
has an instructress in charge, or the family of an instructor. There 
are daily occupations for both boys and girls; the district physician 
looks after the health of the children. Stockholm districts support 44 
of these rural homes, and in 1890 there were 498 children sent out. 
The expenditures were $4,288, not including gifts. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
_ The secondary schools “do not form a direet continuation of the pri- 
mary schools as in the United States,”! although they are preparatory 
to university education. These schools are all complete in their organ- 
ization, although they are usually considered to be of two kinds, the 
higher or complete schools with nine classes, and the lower or incomplete 
schools with two, three, or five classes. Yet “the teaching in these 
classes agrees precisely with that of the corresponding classes of the 
complete secondary schools.” The secondary schools consist of the 
  
‘Information obtained from a thesis of Dr. N. G. W. Lagerstedt, Ph. D., of Stock- 
holm, presented at the International Congress of Education in Chicago in 1893.

  EDUCATION IN SWEDEN. ms 483- 
classical and “modern” (Real) schools. The curriculum comprises 
nine years and the boys (girls are not admitted to these schools) must 
be 9 years of age before entering. The plan of instruction is the same 
for the first three years; during that period German is the only foreign 
language taught. Then a bifurcation takes place, some pursuing the 
Latin (classical) course, others the English (modern) course. “Still, 
‘in all subjects other than Latin and English, instruction is as a rule 
the same for the two following years. French is taken up in the fifth 
year, both in the modern and the classical side.” The last four years, 
the sixth to the ninth, the pupils of the modern and classical lines are 
separated, and at the same period+—the sixth year—a new division takes 
place on the classical side. Greek is taken up by some, English by 
others—that is, there is “a full classical section and a half classical sec- 
tion.” At the close of the secondary course the maturity, or gradua- 
tion, examination takes place; the diploma attained, the student may 
then pass to the university, to military or forestry schools, or to low- 
grade positions in the Government service. This rnaturity examination 
is quite a severe one, and the boys of the modern (Real) side, not hay- 
ing studied Latin, must give special evidence “of greater knowledge 
in mathematics, natural sciences, and modern languages than the boys 
on the classical side.” 
The question has been broached in Sweden of bringing the elemen- 
tary and secondary schools into closer connection by eliminating one or 
more of the lower classes of the secondary schools, and making the 
elementary directly preparatory to the secondary school, thus, in a 
measure, forming a common school for all classes. Further reforms 
have been suggested which will take Latin and Greek out of the 
secondary schools to a great extent, and will place them in the univer- 
sity as a special department. Secondary education for girls was for- 
merly almost entirely of a private character, or was the result of aid 
from municipal authorities, but the present progressive movements 
have brought about State subsidies for such schools. 
As an outcome of the discussions concerning the great influx of 
students at the universities, and the need of more practical instruction 
of a secondary character for both boys. and girls, the Palmgren Practical 
Work School was founded in 1876. While Sléjd is a main feature of 
its curriculum, the aim of the school is to train both sexes in those 
studies which lead to practical life, and there is no special limit as to 
the elementary or secondary character of the school, nor as to the age 
of applicants for admission. The esthetic side is not neglected, for the 
schoolrooms are ornamented with art works of various kinds, and even 
the desks and chairs have the style of the old Norse, the Gothic, or 
the German Renaissance period. The success of the school has been 
noticeable, and, in 1888, the maturity examination was successfully 
passed by two boys and two girls. The school has two divisions, the 
one for a cultivation of manual dexterity and the other for studies tend-

_ing towards intellectual progress; in its preparatory classes children 
from 6 to 9 years of age having no previous schooling are admitted. 
After passing through three classes they are fitted for the lowest classes 
of the Real schools or the gymnasia. The next division is that of a 
Real gymnasium with nine classes, then there is a seminary or normal 
school for the training of teachers of Sléjd. 
The course is most comprehensive in character, giving, as it does, a 
liberal education and a most thorough training in Sléjd. Sléjd is obli- 
gatory upon all, and it includes feminine Sl6jd as well as that in which 
boys particularly are trained. Pupils who do not attend the school are 
admitted to Slojd instruction at a moderate fee. The three-months 
courses for the training of Sléjd teachers include also lessons in draw- 
ing and the pedagogics of Sléjd’. 
The number of secondary schools is 70, of which only about 30 fulfill 
the requirements as preparatory schoolsto the universities. Theinstruc- 
tion is nearly free, amounting to only about $8 or $10 for each pupil. 
In 1891 there were 14,474 students, and in the same year 650 students 
had passed the required examination for admittance to the universi- 
ties, among them 15 women. The expenditures for secondary educa- 
tion amount to nearly $1,000,000 a year. 
Students who wish to pursue a mercantile career attend the com- 
mercial schools (or colleges) of Stockholm and Géteborg, which have 
two-year courses and an average of more than 100 pupils, and which 
receive governmental subsidies as well as private donations. The stu- 
dents pay tuition fees also. Then there are private commercial schools 
which give excellent instruction. 
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. 
The presentation of the public educational system of Sweden would 
be incomplete without mention of the university, which is thus aptly 
described by Dr. Lagerstedt: 
The public universities of Sweden are two, the University of Upsala and the 
University of Lund. Besides these there is a faculty of medicine, or a “‘ medical col- 
lege,” in Stockholm. There are two other universities of Sweden, those of Stock- 
holm and Giteborg. They are only a few years old, and were founded and are 
maintained wholly by private means without aid from the state. But they will 
both, in all probability, soon be brought into the system of education. It is proper, 
> therefore, that they be mentioned in this place. 
Each of the old state universities, the universities of Upsala and Lund, comprises 
four faculties or departments, the faculties of theology, law, medicine, and philoso- 
phy. The faculty or department of philosophy is divided into two sections, one 
for literature, history, philosophy, philology, and allied branches of knowledge; 
the other for mathematics and the natural and physical sciences. 
The original and chief object of a university is the promotion of knowledge. The 
teachers have to disclose and elucidate to the students the treasures of literature 
and the results of scientific investigation, as well as to direct the students’ ownstudy. 
Itis also expected of the professors that they shall themselves contribute to the 
advancement of human knowledge by observation and research. The proficiency of

  EDUCATION IN SWEDEN. A435 
students in Swedish universities is, as elsewhere, ascertained by examinations, which 
are of a twofold character. . 
The universities of Europe, generally, are expected to fill certain requirements 
demanded by the state. The state requires from its officials and from private citizens 
proposing to enter certain important vocations—that of medicine, for instance—that 
they give evidence of possessing the knowledge and skill necessary to their special call- 
ing. Now, in some cases, the university teaching and the ordinary examinations have 
been considered as serving this additional publicend. In other cases the universities 
have had to undertake the organization of courses of instruction required by the state 
for the purpose just mentioned, and the testing of proficiency therein by special 
examinations—civic or state examinations, as they may be called. This part of uni- 
versity work naturally has a less scientific character, it is more elementary, and the 
object of the examination is to ascertain that the students have attained certain 
- fixed standards of knowledge rather than to ascertain the results of deep scientific 
study. The practical importance of this part of the universities’ work may some- 
times offer temptations subordinate to their strictly scientific work, and make 
the higher examinations, the university examinations proper, by technicalities or 
regulation, too much like the civic or state examinations. The present regulations 
and arrangements of the Swedish universities seem to avoid this danger. 
The faculties of theology and of law have both kinds of examinations, scientific 
and civic. Most of thestudents of theology and of law pass the civic examinations 
only, and thus become entitled to enter the service of the state as judges or other offi- 
cials of that of the state church as ecclesiastics. Some, however, of the law and theo- 
logical students take the university examinations proper, success in which, in some 
cases, gives them a preference in the matter of appointments over those of their 
colleagues who have been content to pass the civic examinations only. 
The department of medicine offers examinations of the higher grade only. As may 
be inferred from this, the studies of the Swedish medical students are very thorough. 
Generally it takes students eight to ten years of hard work after matriculation to com- 
plete their university studies. There are two examinations in the faculty of medi- 
cine. The first is merely preparatory to the second, 
The fourth of the faculties or departments is that of philosophy. Like the faculty 
of medicine, this faculty has no civic examinations. Neglecting some minor prepara- 
tory examinations that are passed by students wishing to enter the other depart- 
ments, there are two examinations in the faculty of philosophy, namely, the exami- _ 
nation for the rank of candidate of philosophy and that for “‘licentiate of philosophy.” 
To become a candidate of philosophy the aspirant must be examined in five different 
subjects, at least. These subjects may be chosen quite freely among the branches of 
knowledge that belong to both sections of the department of philosophy. The can- 
didate must give proof of complete mastery of one of these subjects, or, if he so pre- 
fer, of excellent attainments in two. 
If a candidate of philosophy wishes to obtain the rank of licentiate, he must be 
examined in at least two branches of knowledge, quite freely chosen from the curric- 
ulum of the department, and he must give evidence that he has acquired a deeper 
and scientific knowledge of them. A student is, however, not obliged to be a candi- 
date of philosophy before he attempts to obtain the licentiate’s degree, but may 
proceed immediately to the latter degree, though in this case he has to give evidence 
ot his scientific study of at least three sciences or branches of knowledge. 
A licentiate of philosophy wishing to become a doctor of philosophy, in lieu of 
further examination, has to publish a scientific treatise, based on his own independent 
researches, and to defend this treatise publicly. If the thesis and the defense of it are 
considered to be satisfactory, the licentiate is admitted to the degree of doctor of 
philosophy. 
Each of the two university examinations may be considered to demand, as a rule, 
three or four years of study in preparation. 
There are two points to which attention is especially directed. ‘The first is the _ 
   
-P-A-G-E-464
    / f 
    436 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
absolutely unlimited choice of studies open to the students within the limits of the 
department. It is quite lately that the examinations now in question have been so 
arranged as to permit such choice. Formerly some subjects were optional, others 
remaining compulsory, and there were rather intricate regulations with regard to 
the combination of subjects; some might be combined, others not. The allowing 
of this unlimited choice of subjects is considered in Sweden to be a decidedly pro- 
gressive step, and.one thht will prove of great use’in advancing deep and true 
scientific study. 
The other point is the regulation permitting students who have passed the entrance 
xamination to the university without Latin to be nevertheless admitted to the 
examinations for candidates and licentiates of philosophy, provided that the sub- 
jects chosen for examination are chiefly mathematics and natural sciences. This is 
quite different from the plan at the German universities. But Latin is still required 
in yweden of all who wish to pass other university examinations. 
ost of the students who pass the examinations for candidate or licentiate of 
philosophy afterwards become teachers in the secondary schools. There are two 
classes of such teachers—a higher and a lower one, The former class chiefly 
instructs the senior students in the secondary schools; the latter teach the lower 
classes. The teachers of the higher order must be licentiates or doctors of philoso- 
phy; those of the lower class at least candidates. : 
It is required, moreover, of both that they so pass their examinations that a cer- 
tain number of the school subjects, four or five, shall have been included, in accord- 
ance with special regulations, which need not now be specified. 
‘he two younger universities of Sweden, those of Stockholm and Géteborg, will 
probably in a short time be allowed to hold examinations of the same kind as the 
old state universities, and students passing such examinations will have the same 
ts asif they had passed those of the old universities. No applicants but those who 
haye passed the maturity examination will be admitted to these university exami- 
nations, just as is now the case in the other and older universities. There will, how- 
ever, be an important difference between the old state universities and these new 
              3 independent ones. While the former admit no other students than such as have 
passed the examination of maturity, the latter will also admit other students, such 
as are called in America special students. These are only required to give some 
proof, generally by a special examination, that they are capable of receiving the 
instruction in the subject or in those subjects which they propose to follow. After 
haying completed such a special study at the university, the student, if he wishes, 
is examined therein, and, if successful, receives a certificate indicating the result of 
his work. To this kind of examination, as a matter of course, every student of the 
universities may be admitted. 
t may be seen, then, that it is the aim of the young universities to compete 
with the old ones as centers of higher scientific teaching, and, at the same time, to 
make their instruction and resources accessible to wider circles of students. 
omen have been admitted to the Swedish universities for about twenty years. 
The number of women students, however, has been, and still is, comparatively 
small, and only a very few, hardly ten, have left the universities after having passed 
a complete university course. 
The number of students at Upsala may be estimated at from 1,800 to 2,000; at - 
Lund from 900 to 1,000; at Stockholm, 200; in Goteborg, 100. 
The university at Géteborg has, at present, a department for the humanities. The 
one at Stockholm also has the humanities, departments of mathematics and natural 
sciences, and will soon start a department of law. 
The Pharmaceutic Institute in Stockholm imparts the knowledge requisite for 
practicing pharmacy. Its students average about 70. In order to practice dentistry 
the so-called student’s examination has to be passed, also two special examinations 
in the presence of examiners appointed by the Royal Medical Board. The course is 
about three years. ‘here are dental colleges in Stockholm and Giéteborg.

    EDUCATION IN SWEDEN. 437 
TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
In Sweden the interests of technical education are promoted by 
means of many colleges of greater or less importance, as is stated by 
Herr Rector V. Adler in the “Swedish Catalogue, 11, Statisties, by Dr. 
S. A. Léfstrém, World’s Columbian Exposition, at Chicago, in 1893.” 
The Technical High School stands foremost in this work, and the noted Technical 
School of Stockholm holds a place of its own. For the training of engineers, pos- 
sessing, however, fewer resources than the high school, are Chalmer’s Technical 
Institute in Géteborg and the four state elementary technical schools in Malmé, 
Norrképing, Orebro, and Boris. To these intermediate schools must be added the 
Technical Professional School at Eskilstuna, and the 29 lower technical professional 
schools, which are supported by the state. There are, besides, the Sléjd Society’s 
School in Géteborg and a newly-established school in Lule&, which, to date, have 
worked without Government support. 
The Technical High School at Stockholm, which is the principal polytechnic 
institute in Sweden, has for its object the scientific training of young students who 
intend to devote themselves to some technical occupation. 
“The subjects of instruction at this high school are: Mathematics, geodesy, 
topography, descriptive geometry, elementary mechanics, higher theoretical 
mechanics, descriptive mechanics, the theory and practice of machine construction, 
mining mechanics, the study of steamship construction, mechanical technology, gen- 
eral and applied physics, general and analytical chemistry, chemical technology, 
laboratory work, mining chemistry, general and special metallurgy (of iron, etc.), met-- 
allurgic laboratory work, mineralogy and geology, mining, building, building esti- 
mates, architecture, history of architecture, construction of roads and waterways, 
linear drawing, free-hand drawing, ornament modeling, political economy, and fae- 
tory work.” 
The high school includes the following five technical departments, viz.: (1) 
Machine construction and mechanical technology, with from three to four years’ 
course; (II) Technical chemistry, with a three years’ course; (III) Metallurgy, in 
three subdivisions, the first for mining mechanics, with a four years’ course, the 
second for metallurgy and smelting, the third for mining; the two latter divisions 
being courses of either three or four years; (IV) Architecture with a course of four 
years; (V) Road and waterway construction, with equal courses of four years’ dur- 
ation. The course of instruction during the first y is the same for all the ordinary 
pupils at the school; then special studies are pursued. 
The students at the high school are: (1) Ordinary, who attend until they have 
acquired the amount of skill requisite to the obtaining of a full certificate after a 
complete course; (2) Special, who, when they show themselves possessed of the skill 
required by the directors, enjoy instruction in a lesser number of subjects, and 
may obtain certificates of their attainments in those branches; and (3) extra pupils 
who need not give any previous proof of their ability by passing an entrance exami- 
nation, and who may enjoy the instruction, but are not entitled to receive any _ 
testimonial from the college as to their attainments. For ordinary students the 
instruction is free; special and extra pupils pay a fee fixed by the directors and 
“ varying between 10 kr. and 50 kr. ($2.68—$13.40) per term. The management of 
the high school is under the direction of a governing body appointed by the King. 
The high school has, moreover, a library of about 23,000 volumes, and above 500 
manuscript reports of technical matters furnished by traveling students, and it owns 
in addition a valuable collection of models, instruments, ete., used at lectures on 
the various branches of study. 
The Technical School in Stockholm has for its aim to give a clear and practical 
training in the knowledge requisite for an intelligent and accurate execution of

industrial work, and by this means to further Swedish handicrafts and the develop- 
ment and improvement of art industry. The departments are five in number, viz: 
(1) The Technical Evening and Sunday School, intended for pupils (above 14) and 
men, more particularly those who are already engaged in factories and handicrafts. 
' The pupils have free choice of subjects, and the scheme of study is so arranged that 
they may make a selection from eighteen branches of industrial education; (2) the 
Technical School for Women (students above 14 years of age) seeks to develop that 
intelligent and artistic insight and skill which are the bases of such technical 
employment as may be most profitably pursued by women. The subjects of instruc- 
tion are nine in number, and are according to the students’ choice; (3) the Higher 
Art Industrial School for both men and women students (above 16 years of age), 
and the three years’ course of instruction demands the whole or the greater part 
of the school day during the term. In the first section of this school is taught pat- 
tern drawing (both for cabinetmaking and artistic metal work, etc.); in the second, 
the branches pursued are decorative painting, lacquer work, etc; in the third, mod- 
eling, ornament, etc.; in the fourth, wood carving, chasing, engraving and work 
inthe finer metals; and in the fifth section are trained the future teachers of drawing, 
modeling, and lettering in the schools for secondary instruction, technical element- 
ary schools, and normal colleges for teachers; (4) the school of building, with a three 
years’ course and an obligatory scheme of instruction, gives the training requisite 
for the strict accuracy demanded in the preparation. of building plans; it receives 
pupils above 16 years of.age; (5) the school for machine work (founded 1890) gives 
‘such instruction as is required for the extremely accurate knowledge demanded by 
mechanical technical work, and it receives pupils who are above 16 years of age. 
The first section is for the training of chief engineers, machinists, and draftsmen 
in mechanical workshops; in the second, foremen of mills receive instruction; the 
third deals with assistant engineers and machinists, workers of metal plate for 
steam boilers, smiths, makers of mechanical instruments, makers of clocks and 
watches, etc.; in the fourth, shipbuilders receive their training; the fifth gives 
instruction to metal plate workers for house, bridge, and railway construction, and 
to constructors of water and gas systems, etc.; the sixth, to founders, and the 
seventh is for the training of electro-machinists. An additional day school gives daily 
instruction in professional and decorative painting. 
“The ordinary subjects of instruction at the technical sehool are: Geometrical 
construction, descriptive geometry, linear drawing, perspective and free-hand draw- 
ing, industrial art designs, figure and landscape drawing, painting (after ornamental 
“and detached objects, bas-reliefs, drapery, plants, animals, etc.), modeling (from 
ornaments and figures), arithmetic, algebra, geometry, analytical and applied 
mechanics, mechanical drawing and mechanical technology, experimental physics, | 
chemistry and chemical technology, knowledge of commercial objects, instruction 
in tools, building construction, architecture and design, elements of field survey- | 
ing and leveling, composition, bookkeeping, ornamental lettering, together with 
caligraphy, advanced industrial art designs, wood carving, embossing, chasing, | 
engraving, making of plaster casts, elementary history of art, estimates and (since 
1887) special designs and applications for embossed leather work and painting on 
porcelain and glass. Of no small importance is the instruction in the extraordinary 
subjects of training, for which division of work a special Government grant of 
$1,070 is received. The subjects taught include knowledge of styles and ornamental 
design. decorative and professional painting, art needlework, photography, hygiene 
of dwelling houses and workshops, and gymnastics.” 
The lecture rooms contain valuable collections of such models and engravings as | 
are of illustrative importance in the instruction. The library numbers 10,000 vol- | 
umes, mostly technical literature, and a well-arranged collection of more than 18,000 
design engravings. The school museum embraces many thousand models, consist- 
ing in great part of plaster casts and metal castings from famous monumental con- | 
struction; a collection of copies of Italian decorative paintings, models for wood

carving, fine metal work, art textiles, ete., a technical collection of dyestuffs, metals, 
weaving material, all the kinds of wood usually employed in various branches of 
carpentry, ete. : 
Chalmer’s Technical Institute in Géteborg is for the training of such young 
students as are intended for those industrial professions which demand a knowl- 
edge of natural science and especially an acquaintance with technical chemistry; 
the institute gives such teaching in a higher and in a lower division. The higher 
or technical scientific division embraces three classes of a one year’s course and 
then divides after the first year’s training into four different sections, viz: the 
mechanical-technical, that for technical chemistry, the section for construction of 
roads, waterways, and buildings, and, finally, that for shipbuilding. The lower 
division, in which the teaching is of a general comprehensive and practical character, 
embraces two one-year classes. 
There are, besides, in Sweden, four technical elementary schools—in Malms 
(founded 1853), in Norrképing, Orebro, and Boris. Their object is to impart ele- 
mentary technical knowledge to young pupils wishing to fit themselves for indus- 
trial occupations. The subjects taught are mathematics, mechanics, physics, chem- 
istry, mineralogy, and geognosy, the Swedish language, the principal modern lan- 
guages, according to choice, commercial bookkeeping, architecture, free hand draw- 
ing, modeling, and factory oe 
The technical school in Eskilstuna consists of two departments. The older of 
these, the Sunday and evening school, is intended for instruction in the most neces- 
sary elementary technical knowledge, of such persons who are already engaged in 
industrial pursuits, especially in the iron and steel manufacture. The subjects of 
instruction (all optional) are mathematics, descriptive geometry, linear drawing, 
general mechanics, mechanical technology, practical mechanics, machine drawing, 
physics, chemistry, frechand drawing, modeling, professional drawing, good hand- 
writing, the Swedish language and bookkeeping. The instruction is given ina 
higher and in a lower course, both of two years. The Sunday and evening school 
is in yearly receipt of'a grant of $2,144. The second department is for instruction 
in finer smith’s and metal work; it receives (since 1889) a yearly grant of $402 from — 
the town of Eskilstuna, and an annual grant from the Government of $1,072. The 
subjects are freehand drawing, modeling, wood carving, engraving in metal, metal 
casting, chasing, embossing, etching, galvanizing, smithing, filing, turning, letter- 
ing and knowledge of styles. 
In 1892 there were 29*lower technical work schools in various large towns, and 
intended principally to give young people, engaged in handicrafts and manufac- 
tures, the necessary instruction in their native language, good writing, arithmetic, 
freehand drawing, linear drawing, professional drawings, modeling, and various 
forms of instruction in professional painting, building design, machine and build- 
ing drawing. 
The number of teachers and pupils at the technical schools during the spring 
term of 1892, andthe amount of Government and communal subsidies in the same year, 
is shown in the following table:

Besides the above-mentioned subsidies, the schools had the use of donated funds as 
follows: Technical high school, $33,500; Chalmer’s Technical Institute, $93,800; 
technical school at Stockholm, $16,884; technical school at Eskilstuna, $7,370. 
AGRICULTURAL, DAIRY, FORESTRY, AND MINING SCHOOLS. 
There are twenty-five agricultural schools in different parts of the 
kingdom which are aided both by the Government and by agricultural 
societies. They give practical education to young men, such as will 
enable them to carry on farms of their own. There are also higher 
schools of agriculture at Ultuna, near Upsala, and at Aluarp in Skane, 
connected with both of which are extensive farms. Instruction in gar- 
dening is also given at all these schools, at the normal schools, and 
there are school gardens in connection with the common schools, the 
parish granting the necessary ground. 
The Government also supports a dairy college, which is intended to 
train teachers and dairymen in the management of a dairy; this college 
has a twelve months’ course. There are also two dairy schools having 
- yearly courses, and 18 stations with two-year courses for training 
dairymaids. 
A higher grade forestry school was established in Stockholm, in 1828, 
_ with the object of diffusing more general knowledge of the economy of 
forestry and the chase, and also for giving practical training to for- 
esters. Tuition is gratis, and the requisites for admission are a strong 
: physique and the passing of the university-entrance examination with 
a preparatory one-year course at the Omberg School of Forestry. 
The course of study is two years. The teaching corps consists of a 
director, two professors and five teachers; the students numbered 22 in 
1892. The Omberg school is preparatory to the Stockholm school, and 
there are five other schools devoted to the training of foresters or 
rangers, Total number of students, 60 in 1892. 
Mining schools are three in number. The higher grade school forms 
a division of the technical high school in Stockholm; the lower grade 
mining schools are in the mining districts of Falun (dating from 1822) 
and Filipstad (from 1830). The Government and the Association of 
Tronmasters defray the expenses; the association provides for the 
practical instruction in the Stockholm school, and there is an equal 
division between the Government and Association as regards the cost 
of teaching in the other schools. 
TRAINING FOR THE ARMY AND NAVY. 
The Royal Military Academy, founded in 1796, has as its object the 
promotion of military science. Then there are the staff and military 
colleges, the military riding school and the artillery and engineering 
school. The staff college in Stockholm has a two-year course and is ~ 
chiefly designed to train staff officers; it numbered 38 pupils in 1892. 
The high school for the royal artillery and engineers in Stockholm 
-humbers 51 pupils; the military college at Karlberg, near Stockholm,
-P-A-G-E-469
    
          EDUCATION IN SWEDEN. 44t 
trains young men who desire to become officers in the army. Fifty-six 
pupils passed their final examination in 1892. The military riding 
-, school at Strémsholm, and schools for corporals, cadets, noncommis- 
sioned officers, and gunnery schools complete the army training. 
The Royal Naval School in Stockholm trains officers for the navy 
and had 73 students under instruction in 1892. For the ordinary 
forms of navigation and engineering there are schools of navigation in 
Stockholm, Géteborg, Gefle, Malmé, Kalmar, Hernésand, Visby, Karls- 
hamn, Vestervik, and Strémstad, the aggregate number of pupils being 
338 in 1892. During the year 126 pupils passed the mate’s examination, 
and 74 that of master; 55 passed as ordinary engineers, and 32 as chief 
engineers. ‘ 
THE DEFECTIVE CLASSES. 
By law of May 31, 1889, the education of deaf-mutes of school age is 
made compulsory, and Sweden has been divided for this phase of edu- 
cation into seven districts, each one being responsible for the education . 
of the deaf-mutes within its jurisdiction. Prior to such law the deaf 
were ‘educated at the Manilla Institute in Stockholm, which .was 
founded in 1809. For adult deaf-mutes there are asylums in Vadstena, 
Bollniis, and Skara. A governmental subsidy of $53,600 is granted 
annually for the education of the deaf-mutes. The census of 1890 
enumerated 5,307 deaf-mutes in Sweden—2,952 of them men, 2,355 
women. 
The blind are under instruction at the Royal Institute for the Blind 
at Tomteboda, near Stockholm, and in two smaller institutes which 
also receive governmental aid ($3,000 in 1891). The Royal Institute 
receives an annual subsidy of $13,500 and has to date 76 pupils. For 
the printing of reading matter for the blind $700 was granted during 
1891 and $300 for the support of pupil teachers. The blind people of 
Sweden numbered 3,948 in 1890—males, 1,880; females, 2,068. In Skara 
an asylum for blind and deaf-mute children had 11 pupils. 
The more seriously afflicted—the idiot—is also well taken care of, for 
there are 16 educational institutions, with 432 places, for this class, 6 » 
industrial homes capable of housing 84 pupils, and 8 asylums affording 
place for 106 children, besides a number of private asylums. The school 
for idiots in Stockholm has a training department for female teachers 
and nurses. The number of idiots of school age, according to a late 
estimate, is 2,000. 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CHARITIES. 
The Swedes take good care of their poor, for, in addition to what is 
done for the adult population, there are special regulations for the care 
of poor children of school age, as heretofore mentioned ; and more, there 
are children’s homes and institutions for the relief of the poor. The       
    
-P-A-G-E-470
  442 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
publie hospital for infants in Stockholm is especially noteworthy for its 
furnishings and general arrangements, and there are other publie hes- 
pitals which may be counted among the charitable institutions, as they 
admit poor people at public expense. Private charities are conducted 
by private societies, among which may be named the Charity Organi- 
zation Society of Stockholm. The Masonie fraternity also supports a 
large orphan asylum in Stockholm. Charitable institutions, endow- 
ments, ete., bring the amounts contributed for the help of the poorer 
classes to about $130,000 annually, and nearly twice that sum is given 
for infant education and care. 
Counted among the aids to the poor are the people’s kitchens, where, 
when there is scarcity of work, plain and substantial meals are given _ 
for nothing, or for a merely nominal sum, to those who are in need of 
assistance. 
EDUCATIONAL AIDS. 
Under this heading may be grouped the libraries, museums, art and 
archeological societies, conservatories of music, academies and learned 
societies, college of antiquities, and anthropological and geographical 
societies. 
For the higher development of civil engineers there are the Royal 
Boards for Public Buildings and for Road and Water Works, which 
under governmental contraets give opportunity for technical advance- 
ment. The Economic Survey of Sweden and the Royal Board of Land 
Surveying furnish accurate knowledge as to the land area, boundary 
lines, ete., of the country. The Topographical, Geological, and Hydro- 
graphic Surveys are each in turn carrying on technical work of great 
value, but which can only be touched upon incidentally here. 
There are lectures in schools and associations upon the development 
of photographic art, and there are clubs and societies which have 
exhibitions of photography. This art is also taught in the technical 
schools, and for technical execution there are special schools of photo- 
graphy established, from which selected pupils go to the Academy of 
Fine Arts. 
The public libraries of Sweden, dating from 1886, have, under the 
auspices of the Royal Library in Stockholm, annually issued a cata- 
logue which includes the foreign accessions to the libraries in Stockholm, 
to those of the universities at Lund and Upsala, to the Academy of 
Sciences, the Academy of Literature, History, and Antiquities, to the 
Academy of Fine Arts, to the Academy of Agriculture, to the Caroline 
Medico-Surgical Institute, the Swedish Society of Physicians, the Tech- 
- nical High School, the Stockholm Technical School, the Central Bureau 
of Statistics, Library of Parliament, and to the libraries belonging to 
the students and to the Society of Sciences in Upsala. This catalogue 
is furnished, in accordance with the Swedish copyright law, to the first 
three libraries, and by means of this cooperation the value of all these 
libraries is greatly enhanced,

  EDUCATION IN SWEDEN. 443 
The Royal Library in Stockholm numbers 230,000 volumes, 7,800 
MSS., and thousands of portfolios containing maps, engravings, ete. 
In, 1892 there were 1,194 foreign works received and 13,162 from the 
Swedish press. The libraries of the universities number 220,000 vol- 
umes at Upsala, and 130,000 volumes at Lund; of late years they have 
received increased subsidies for purchase of new works, and have 
enlarged their reading rooms. The Academy of Sciences owns about 
50,000 volumes. There are school libraries in Strengnis, Vesterds, 
Skara, Linképing, and Vexjé. Popular and parish libraries are devel- 
oping rapidly both in Stockholm and in rural parishes. 
The museums and collections may be enumerated as follows: The 
National Museum in Stockholm, with 1,450 oil paintings, 100,000 
engravings and sketches, 850 works of sculpture of marble and bronze, 
besides antique vases, terra-cottas, Egyptian antiquities, a historical 
division and a cabinet of medals; the Museum of Natural History, 
divided into six sections and under the supervision of the Royal 
Academy of Sciences in Stockholm; the Historical Museum of the 
University of Lund, with 10,000 objects on exhibition, the Stone Age 
being especially well represented; the Nordiska Museum, with its 
Scandinavian ethnographical collections; the College of Antiquities, 
which cares for manuscript antiquities, with special interpretation of 
Icelandic manuscripts concerning Scandinavian history; collections of 
art, historical portraits, etc., at the royal castles of Gripsholm and 
Drottningholm; important collections of natural objects at the Uni- 
versities of Lund and Upsala, in Géteborg, and in many of the schools 
for secondary education. = 
The academies and learned societies include the Swedish Academy, 
established in 1786 for the purpose of giving the Swedish language 
a definite form, and which commenced ‘the dictionary of the Swedish 
language” in 1893—this dictionary to be completed in forty years; the 
Royal Academy of Sciences, established in 1739 by Linné and other 
scientists, and which has for its object the promotion of physical sciences 
and mathematics; the Royal Academy of Literature, History, and 
Antiquities, founded in 1753, and dealing largely with archeological 
matters; the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, founded in 1735, for the 
development of painting; the Royal Academy of Music, founded in 1771, 
which receives a governmental subsidy of $12,000, and $1,600 for 
encouraging composers, and which has a conservatory of music con-. 
nected with it; the Royal Academy of Agriculture, and the Royal Mili- 
tary Academy, both described previously. The learned societies are: 
The Royal Society for Publishing Manuscripts Relating to Scandinavian 
History, founded in 1817 at Stockholm; the Royal Society of Sciences, 
in Upsala, founded 1710; the Royal Physiographical Society, at Lund, 
in 1778; the Royal Society of Sciences and Belles Lettres, at Goteborg, 
founded in 1778; and the Royal Naval Society, at Karlskrona, in 1771;

Society of Physicians, the Society of Apothecaries, the Pedagogical 
Society, the Society for Promoting Fine Arts, the Anthropological- 
Geographical Society, which annually presents a medal to a geographi- 
eal explorer; the Geological Society, and the professional unions at the 
universities. 
SWEDISH GYMNASTICS. ! 
One of the most important adjuncts to education is conceded by the 
Swedish people to be that of gymnastics, and so many have been the 
adherents in Sweden and other countries to the system now in vogue 
as to give it the title of Swedish gymnastics. Training of this kind is 
obligatory in every school, and its influence is noticeable in the fine 
bearing of the Swedish children. 
The Swedish system was founded by P. H. Ling? (1777-1839), a patriot, gym- 
nast, and poet, who was inspired with a desire to revive the ancestral spirit in 
the Swedish people by the help of sport and song, to draw out once more the 
great qualities, the strength, the courage, and the will, which, in old times, had 
distinguished the Scandinavian race. After a hard struggle he succeeded, in 1814, 
in founding the state institution, known as the Royal Central Gymnastic Insti- 
tute, where all teachers of gymnastics throughout the country receive their train- 
ing. To this establishment are due the uniformity and homogeneity which mark 
Swedish instruction in this subject. The institute has a threefold purpose: it 
teaches ordinary gymastics for pedagogic purposes, as well as military and medi- 
eal gymnastics. A complete training in all three branches entails a course of 
three years. Ling’s creative genius produced a system based on ordinary physio- 
logical laws, which was afterwards developed by his pupils and successors. The 
: great end and aim of the system was general social education from a physical, moral, 
and disciplinary point of view. Its distinguishing qualities are simplicity, natural- 
ness, and truth. Its exercises may be adapted to every individual disposition and 
measured so as to suit varying degrees of strength, even the sickly and deformed 
being able to take part, as special exercises are arranged for them. Daily exercises, 
according to the Swedish system, are intended to promote a symmetrical growth of 
the body, and only such movements permitted as, according to anatomical and phys- 
iological laws, would bring about this aim. Bodily health and a harmonious devel- 
opment are the end and aim of instruction in this branch. For this reason the 
movements are divided into classes according to their effect upon the human body, 
while the individual movements of each class are arranged in order of progression 
to follow the growing strength and proficiency of the pupil. 
The same system is followed throughout the country in public and private schools 
alike, as well asin the army and navy. In the state schools, in which the teaching 
of gymnastics is required by law, the instruction is subject to the inspection of the 
Central Institute. The larger towns have gymnastic clubs and associations, which 
enable young men to continue their exercises after they have left school. These 
clubs are generally under the guidance of instructors who are graduates of the Cen- 
tral Institute, and, while the same system is followed as elsewhere, they often extend 
their practice to what may be called applied gymnastics, the object being to intro- 
duce a more sporting and recreative element and to obtain information as to the 
  MInformation obtained from the article by Capt. V. Balck, Dr. A. Wide, and Dr. 
A. Leyertin, as presented in ‘‘ Swedish Catalogue 1, Statistics, 1893,” prepared by 
Dr. Lipstrom for the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893.

individual development and strength. Fencing, sword, and bayonet exercises are 
practiced in the army and navy! and in the schools attached to both services, as well 
as in the amateur clubs of the larger towns. Fencing and sword exercises are 
taught in the higher grade public schools. Medical gymnastics and the art of mas- 
sage have served to bring the Swedish system to the knowledge of the people of other 
countries. Of late years gymnastic associations for women have been formed, and 
among those especially to be noticed are the associations for women of the working 
classes.! 
The mode of treating diseases according to Ling is derived from and founded on 
his pedagogical system, and this special form of training is taught both in the Cen- 
tral Gymnastic Institute and the Gymnastic Orthopedic Institute (both in Stock- 
holm), the latter a state institution since 1827., The course for the kinesipathists— 
embracing educational gymnastics also—occupies a three years’ period for men t 
and two years for women; the requirements for admission being, for men, the pre- 
scribed course’ for matriculation at a university, and for women a corresponding 
high school examination. For physicians there is a twelve months’ course. At the 
Gymnastic Orthopedic Institute physicians and medical students are instructed, 
special educational courses being held for this purpose in the autumn and spring. 
As about 30 persons can attend each course, every Swedish physician becomes versed 
in medical gymnastics. In addition to the two state institutions there are institutes 
for manual gymnastics in almost every town, and during the summer at every 
watering place in Sweden. Every kinesipathist who has passed his final examina- 
tion and been acknowledged by the Royal Medical Board may open a kinesipathic 
institute in conjunction with a physician. The Swedish kinesitherapy, or move- 
ment cure, embraces active, passive, and so-called resisting movements; it embraces 
the usual massage treatment—massage being simply an integrate part of the moye- 
ment cure. According to Ling’s system it is more especially used in treating nervous 
disorders; it is also used by young people of weak development, who possibly can 
not endure educational gymnastics, and it is regarded as an excellent therapeutic 
agent. 
To further develop the study of gymnastics there is the Seandi- 
navian Gymnastic Instructors’ Association, meeting monthly in Stock- 
holm from September to May, when lectures and discussions are held 
in regard to all branches of gymnastics. Every two or three years 
there are also special meetings in Stockholm or some one of the towns 
of Sweden. The endeavor is made to bring about the development of 
national gymnastics as a science, and the organ of the association— ; 
Tidskrift i Gymnastik—published since 1874, is an important factor in 
this matter. :   
   
        
           
       
        
  GENERAL TREND OF EDUCATION. 
        
  The following gleanings from periodicals serve to indicate the latest 
educational movements in Sweden. At date of November, 1891, the 
appointment of Mr. Gilljam as minister of ecclesiastical affairs was 
announced. He was for the usual ten years’ period head teacher of the 
complete gymnasia of Stockholm and afterwards sat in the upper house. 
His natural bias is said to be in favor of classical studies rather than

the more modern branches, so that, in the reform movements apper- 
taining to secondary eduéation, the weight of his influence may be 
assumed to be against the modern-language movement. He, in cooper- 
ation with other members of the governing bodies, has the weal of the 
teacher at heart, so that his appointment as head of the educational 
department will be of benefit to that profession. Of the 375 members 
of the Storthing in 1891-92, six had formerly been teachers. 
University examinations.—A. reorganization of the system of exam- 
inations in Swedish universities was reported in the winter of 189192: 
(1) Latin ceased to be an obligatory part of the examination for 
admittance to the faculties. (2) The number of obligatory studies 
was essentially reduced, and the candidates were allowed to choose 
between certain special studies. (3) A curious custom had been per- 
mitted in connection with university examinations, namely, the so-called 
tentamina privata, or examination at the professor’s house, the public 
examination becoming, then, a mere formality. Now, all examinations 
will be public and before a competent board of examiners. 
Education of women.—For the secondary education of young girls 
the subsidies heretofore allotted were generally from the municipalities, 
~ and there were also donations from private individuals. But within 
a few years the Government has accorded assistance, and by request 
of the minister of ecclesiastical affairs (education being a division of 
this ministry) the subsidy now amounts to 70,000 to 100,000 crowns 
($18,760 to $26,800). The committee which has ben engaged in dis- 
cussing the subject of secondary education of girls, especially pointed 
out the need of hygienic regulations and the necessity of avoiding over- 
pressure. It also stated that the course of study should be especially 
adapted to the special vocation of woman, and hence should include 
rules of hygiene and sanitation, and theoretical and practical lessons 
in domestic economy. 
School organization.—On the 18th of June, 1892, was celebrated the 
anniversary of the establishment of the present system of education 
in Sweden. It owes its gradual development to the compulsory obliga- 
tion and to that of free instruction, to the combined financial interest of 
State and local authorities, and to the fact that the State has taken meas- 
ures to establish normal schools for the proper preparation of teachers. 
_ The whole country celebrated this auspicious event, and at Géteborg 
the rejoicing was especially manifest on account of the establishment 
of a university there. 
Coeducation.—An association was formed in the early part of 1893, 
with the object of establishing a coeducational school, on the American 
plan, in Stockholm. The intention is toemploy the very best methods, 
to lay stress on developing individuality, to limit the number of reci- 
tations, to give practical instruction in skilled handiwork, and to 
have regular gymnastic training. The school is to include children 
between 6 and 16 years of age, and is to give training similar to that of    
-P-A-G-E-475
  EDUCATION IN SWEDEN. 4AT 
a burgher school. A higher division is to train for the higher educa-— 
tional institutions of Sweden. This nya samskola (new coeducational 
school) is to avoid what may be considered to be useless studies; itis to 
develop the self-reliance of the pupils; practical work and physical 
training are to take precedence of mere text-book instruction; the 
classes are to contain a limited number of pupils, and. there is to be a 
gradual blending together of studies so as to form a complete whole. 
Whether a commencement has in reality been made is unknown to date 
of going to print. : 
Training of teachers—At a meeting of normal-school directors in 
Stockholm in June, 1893, four questions were discussed: (1) Should 
there be any change in the statutes concerning the organization of nor- 
mal schools, so far as the statutes relate to time required in military 
service? (2) Should there be any changein regard to examinations for_ 
graduation from the normals? (3) Should examinations for admittance 
be made more rigid? (4) Is a revision of the programme of study in 
the normals desirable, and to what extent? : 
The second question was answered in the negative. The third ques- 
tion called for lengthy discussion, and it was decided that in natural 
sciences, writing, and singing there should be nochange; in arithmetic 
knowledge of common fractions should be the criterion; in geography 
that of Sweden, with a general oversight of European and universal 
geography; in history, more general questions as to knowledge of 
Swedish history. The fourth question was discussed even more fully, 
as follows: As far as religious instruction was concerned, it was decided 
that in the first class it should be from five to six hours a week, the read- 
ing of the history of the apostles should be placed in the third class, 
the letters to the apostles in the fourth class. Reading of select pieces 
from Swedish literature should come in the third class. Compositions, 
as a means of bringing about uniformity in the various seminaries, 
should be written (between eight and twelve of these each year) in 
the recitation rooms and not at home. The number of hours for the - 
study of the mother tongue was decided upon as seven in the first 
class, five in the second class, four in the third and fourth classes. For 
arithmetic and geometry the number of hours was to be four in the 
first class, four in the second, three in the third, and two in the fourth 
class. Penmanship should be finished in the second class. History of 
. pedagogy and methods should be taught in the third and fourth classes. 
The principles of composition should be taught in the fourth class. In 
connection with natural sciences, instruction in regard to anatomy and, 
physiology should be finished in the first class; in the third and fourth 
classes the chemical properties of the body should be taught. In 
regard to military exercises it was not deemed advisable to increase — 
the amount, but one-half hour’s “turnen” would be required. The 
question of adding German to the curriculum was decided in the nega- © 
tive, as the programme was full without additional matter. 
Teachers’ institutes were held during the vacations (commencing in 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
  
  448 ‘EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. ° 
June) in all districts, and pedagogical questions were discussed. The 
public and the press manifested great interest in the meetings. One 
of the questions discussed, in Solleftea, was whether the catechism, in 
its present form, was a text-book for children. Most earnest was the 
discussion, and a resolution was adopted that religious instruction 
should not be limited to head and mind, but should be a matter of 
heart and soul. <A revision of the catechism was deemed necessary. 
At Linképing the subjects discussed were vacations, amount of instrue- 
tion, right of teachers to punish, teaching of temperance principles in 
the common schools. It was decided to carry out the decree of Novem- 
ber “4, 1892, which required the teaching of the nature and effect of 
intoxicants upon the system, by instructing the children in every grade 
as to such matters—a time period to be set apart for this. In Stock- 
holm it was decided to introduce the principles of domestic economy 
into the Swedish schools for girls. 
Vacation study.—Summer courses for advanced study are held in 
different parts of Sweden. The aim is to train more thoroughly in 
special lines of study. These courses, in 1893, covered general sub- 
jects for the benefit of the people at large, more specific subjects for 
teachers of the common schools and for those in attendance on the 
higher schools for girls. The reports, as presented in the Svensk Lir- 
aretidning, indicate great interest among those under instruction. 
Excursions were undertaken in the interests of geological study; muse- 
ums, libraries, and general fine-art collections were visited. 
Lecture course-—University lectures' at Upsala in 1893 covered 
ancient history (Israels dlsta historia); Scandinavian history; Sweden 
during the Reformation period (Sveriges Statistik under Reformations- 
tider, 1520-1611); the earth’s evolution from the geological standpoint; 
psychology; the mother tongue, from the grammatical and scientific 
standpoint; the Reformation period; mammalia; evolution at different 
periods of the earth’s history. The time plan included the dates August 
14 to 26, and, after the general presentation of the thesis, there was dis- 
cussion. These lectures seem also: to include visits to museums and 
other points which would add to the general understanding of the sub- 
ject presented. 
EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE AND REPORTS.

THE OLDEST DESCRIPTION OF ATHLETIC GAMES. 
During the siege of Troy, when Achilles had slain Hector after a 
mighty combat and had stripped from him the bronze armor which 
he had taken from the body of Patroclus, Achilles’ first thought 
was for his dead comrade, who still lay unburied and unbewailed. 
Dragging the corpse of Hector with them, the Greeks proceeded to 
their ships, and there made lamentations around the dead Patroclus, 
Achilles leading their mourning. 
A funeral feast was prepared, and oxen, sheep, goats, and boars 
were killed until blood flowed on all sides of the corpse. After they 
had eaten their mournful meal, they retired to their tents to rest. The 
dawn of the morning found the Grecian chiefs once again weeping 
around their dead. Agamemnon sent men and mules to gather wood, 
and built a funeral pyre, to which the body was borne with extravagant 
manifestations of woe, the flowing-haired Greeks cutting off their locks 
and heaping them upon the corpse. 
After the pile had been consumed by fire and the bones of Patroclus 
had been gathered up and placed in the urn, AchiJles detained the 
multitude there and from his ships brought forth, as prizes for the

funeral games, caldrons, and tripods, and horses, and mules, and 
strong oxen, and fair-girdled women, and shining steel. For the first 
in the chariot race he offered a maid of peerless form and an eared 
tripod; for the second, a 6-year-old horse, unbroken; for the third, a 
goodly caldron yet untouched by fire; for the fourth, two talents of 
gold; and for the fifth, a two-handled urn. As the prize in the boxing 
match he promised a 6-year-old mule, and to the vanquished a goblet. 
Next in order came the wrestling match, in which the victor was to be 
rewarded with a tripod for the hearth, which the Greeks valued at 12 
oxen, and the vanquished was to receive a damsel, skilled in house- 
hold arts, whom they esteemed to be worth 4 oxen. For the winner in 
the foot race there was set forth a silver-wrought bowl, in beauty by 
far the best in all the earth; for the second, an ox, and for the third, 
half a talent of gold. Then Achilles brought into the ring a ponderous 
spear and a caldron embossed with flowers; for these the throwers of 
the javelin contended. 
The contests which these prizes and this occasion evoked were of the 
most exciting description, and anything less than a full transcription 
of Homer’s stirring lines would fail to do them justice. Such fullness 
is impossible, but a few of the details may be given to further indicate 
the antiquity and character of the funeral games. _ 
In the chariot race Eumelus, Diomedes, Menelaus, Antilochus, and 
Meriones took part, but the fifth prize was not claimed. Achilles placed 
it in Nestor’s hands as a memento of the games, since age lay heavy on 
Nestor’s limbs and forbade him to contend. He took the prizé and said: 
Son, thou hast spoken rightly, for these limbs 
Are strong no longer; neither feet nor hands 
Move on each side with vigor as of yore. 
Would I were but as young, with strength as great, 
As when the Epeians in Buprasium laid 
King Amarynceus in the sepulcher, 
And funeral games were offered by his sons. 
Then of the Epeians there was none like me; 
Nor of the Pyian youths, nor yet among 
The brave Atolians. In the boxing match 
I took the prize from Clytomedes, son 
Of Enops, and in wrestling overcame 
Ancwus, the Pleuronian, who rose up 
Against me. In the foot race I outstripped, 
. Fleet as he was, Iphiclus, and beyond 
Phyleus and Polydore I threw the spear. 
Only the sons of the Actor won the race 
Against me with their chariot, and they won 
Through force of numbers. * * 
* * * Such was I once. Now feats like these 
Belong to other younger men, and I, 
Though eminent among the heroes once, 
Must do as sad old age admonishes. !

In the boxing match the unsuccessful contestant against the skilful 
Epeius was 
Euryalus, whose father was the king 
Mecisteus of Talaion’s line, the same 
Who went to Thebes and overcame of old, 
In all the funeral games of Gdipus, 
The sons of Cadmus. 
Such is Homer’s description in the twenty-third book of the Iliad of 
the first athletic games of which we have a record; and such were their 
surroundings. 
Nor is this the only instance in which sports of this character are 
mentioned in the Iliad. In the second book it is related that Ajax “lay 
idle among his seafaring ships, in sore wrath against Agamemnon, 
Atreus’ son, shepherd 6f the host; and his folk along the shore sported 
with quoits and,with casting of javelins and archery; and the horses, 
each beside his own chariot, stood idle, * * *-: while the men 
yearned for their warrior chief and wandered hither and thither through 
the camp, and fought not.” 
The mention of quoits, which are certainly nonwarlike implements, 
shows that even at that early period the Greeks jad games whose only 
objects were amusement and diversion. Nevertheless, the loud lamen- 
tations and doleful surroundings generally of the games described in 
the other passages, together with references to the games in honor of 
King Amarynceus and those of Thebes, in which Mecisteus was the 
victor, clearly show the solemn aspect of the more formal contests. 
Indeed, among the Greeks all the regularly organized games partook 
of a religious character. 
THE PERIODICAL GAMES, 
Though the earliest instances of the celebration of the games were in 
connection with the obsequies of great men, there is no reason for the 
belief that they were confined to such occasions, but, on the contrary, 
it appears that they were employed to add dignity and interest to all 
important ceremonials. The establishment of the regularly recurring 
games, which were the most conspicuous feature of Greek life, probably 
occurred at a time not much later than that in which the Trojan war is 
supposed to have taken place, and none of the traditions relating to 
their origin connect them with funeral rites. These traditions are useful 
to us in indicating some of the connections in which formal games were 
customary, and it is important to know the stories which found general 
belief. 
The Olympian games, the oldest and most famous of them all, were 
said by some to have been established by Zeus after his success over 
Chronos in the contention over the sovereignty ofheaven. But the more 
general belief, according to Pausanius, was that the Idean Hercules, 
the eldest of the five brothers to whom Rhea contided Zeus after his  
-P-A-G-E-482
    454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
birth, institated the contests and gave them their name. Wild olive 
trees were abundant in their vicinity, and the victor was crowned with 
a branch of it. The games were, according to this account, held at the 
beginning of every fifth year! because Hercules and his brothers were 
five in number. ; 
The Delphian, or Pythian, games were believed to have been insti- 
tuted by Theseus in honor of Apollo in thanksgiving for his safe 
return from his encounter with the Minotaur of -Crete. 
The contests held near Corinth, called the Isthmian games, were in 
honor of the boy Melicerta, or Palemon, who was said to have been 
earried by a dolphin to the Isthmus of Corinth after his mother Ino 
had thrown herself and him from the Molurian rock to escape the 
wrath of Athamas. 
The Nemean games were originally introduced by Adrastus, but 
fell into desuetude and were restored by the Epigoni. ~They were held 
in honor of Zeus and Hera. 
All these games arose from very simple beginnings. The first of the 
Olympian contests consisted of a foot race, to which Hercules playfully 
challenged his four brothers. The most ancient of the contests at 
Delphi was the singin of a hymn in honor of Apollo. 
The straight-away foot race continued to be the only Olympic game 
till the fourteenth Olympiad, when a second contest, the “double 
course,” was introduced, i. e., to the end of the-course and back again. 
In the eighteenth Olympiad they added wrestling, and the pentathlon, 
a five-fold contest in leaping, throwing the discus, wrestling, and hurl- 
ing the javelin? Twenty-five years later boxing was made part of the 
exercises, and four-horse chariot races, the pancratium,’ and riding 
races were introduced soon after. 
To the hymn that was the beginning of the exercises at Delphi there 
were added in the forty-eighth Olympiad the music of instruments and. 
singing with the pipes. Athletic contests were introduced at the same 
time or.soon after, making the games very nearly the same as those of 
Olympia, excepting that the competitions in music and poetry always 
retained their preeminence. Valuable prizes were at first awarded in the 
Pythian games, but after the second or third celebration a crown of laurel 
only was awarded, in imitation of the practice at Olympia. Similarly, 
the victors at Nemea were crowned with parsley, and those at the Isth- 
mian games with pine. In fact, so little difference was there in the 
  
They were, therefore, four years apart. 
*In the pentathlon all the contestants were first admitted to the leaping contest, 
and those who crossed a certain space proceeded to throw the javelin. The four most 
successful in this took part in the foot race. The last man in the race dropped out 
and the best three threw the discus. Again the least successful retired and the 
better wrestler of the two remaining won the prize. 
*In the pancratium almost any method of throttling an opponent and of compel- 
ing him to acknowledge himself vanquished was permitted. Wrestling, boxing, 
hugging, choking, and even the deliberate breaking of bones were allowed.
-P-A-G-E-483
    
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 455 
essential features of these festivals, for such they became, that a 
description of those at Olympia will suffice for all. 
They were held every four years, and all the exercises originally took 
place in one day, but in the twenty-seventh Olympiad, after the deci- 
sive victory over the Persians, the Greeks, desiring to do greater honor 
to the gods, so extended the games as to fill five days. 
The games had already acquired great celebrity, and this extension 
of their scope added immeasurably to their popularity and to the 
wonderful hold which they had gained upon the people. Contestants 
gathered from all parts of Greece and the colonies as well, and men of 
the highest rank were found strivi:g for the olive wreath that was 
the pinnacle of Greek ambition. 
The month during which the celebration took place was a holiday 
time throughout all Greece, and even hostile armies disbanded and 
attended the games as brothers. The names of the victors began to be 
recorded about 776 B. C., and soon it became customary to reckon time 
by Olympiads. No more striking proof can be found of the transcend- 
ent importance of the contests to the Greek than this, for all peoples have 
used as their basis of reckoning time that event which is to them the 
most momentous. Christians refer all time to the beginning of the 
Christian era, Mohammedans te the flight of their prophet, Romans to 
the founding of their city, but thé historians of Greece used expres- 
sions like this: “This battle was fought in the fourth year of that 
Olympiad in which Eurybotus, the Athenian, won the prize in the 
course;” or, “This war .came to an end in the first year of the four- 
teenth Olympiad, in which Dasmon, the Corinthian, was victor in 
the stadium.” A war and its attendant circumstances might soon be 
forgotten, but the Olympic foot race, néver! And it was only neces- 
sary to mention the name of the victor at any particular celebration to 
instantly recall to the Grecian mind the exact period to which refer- 
ence was made. 
Naturally the honors accorded to the victors in games of:such impor- 
tance were of the most extravagant description. They were escorted 
to their homes by their enthusiastic countrymen amidst unbounded 
expressions of delight; they received the first seats at the games and 
theatrical performances; poets of the highest merit sang their praises; 
they were exempt from taxation; they were accorded the posts of honor 
on the battle field; the cities in which they lived were proud to erect 
statues in their honor, both at home and in the sacred groves of Olym- 
pia. So numerous did these become that, though the conqueror Mum- 
mius had sent to Rome all he cared to carry away and had ruthlessly 
destroyed many more, there still remained such a number that Pausa- 
nias, in his chapter on Elis, describes 230, and even then he says that he 
mentions “only those who had more renown or finer statues than 
others.” 
When victory meant so much, it is not surprising that dishonorable

means were sometimes used to secureit. But the games were religious 
ceremonies; unfairness was sacrilege, and the guilty ones were not only 
contemned by all those whose praise they sought, but were subjected 
besides to heavy penalties in money, and for some offenses to scourging 
inaddition. There are several instances of attempted bribery on record, 
but in every case the fine was promptly imposed and collected. With 
the money so obtained, statues were erected to Zeus, upon which were 
placed inscriptions of denunciation and warning. 
Deliberate wounding and other species of brutality were not unusual 
and do not seem to have been severely condemned, since Pausanias men- 
tions one man who, though an inferior wrestler, won several contests 
by breaking the fingers of his opponents. Nevertheless, he who killed 
his antagonist forfeited the prize. In the pancratium on one occasion 
a contestant hugged his opponent to death with his legs and arms, but 
the dead body was crowned victor, though the other had suffered. no 
other injury than a broken finger. 
Damoxenus, the boxer, was likewise deprived of his prize because he 
- had struck Creugas under the ribs with his open hand with such force 
as to pierce his side and drag his bowels out, immediately killing him. 
Iceus, of Epidanous, was killed also in boxing, by Cleomedes, who, ina 
‘frenzy of grief at being deprived of the expected prize, pulled down the 
roof of a schoolhouse upon the 60 jsupils inside. 
THE GREEK GYMNASIA. 
The influence of the national games upon the Greek character was 
inealeulable. The periodical congregation of the people of all the states 
and their friendly competition in the games gave rise to a feeling of 
brotherhood and of mutual interest that would otherwise have been 
impossible between independent states. 
The games from the first naturally gave a great impetus to the inter- 
est in physical exercises generally, and this interest, together with a 
realization of the necessity for thorough and intelligent preparation for 
the contests, gave rise to the establishment of the gymnasia, which in 
time became “the center points of Greek life,” and the sources from 
which emanated, directly or indirectly, all that was best in Greek civ- 
ilization. 
Being the place'at which the most intelligent men spent a great 
part of their time, they fostered conferences and an interchange of 
ideas whose effect was the general spread of intelligence the highest 
type of which is seen in the dialogues of Plato and Socrates and the 
teachings of Aristotle. Naturally these discussions, held in the gym- 
nasia by men who were themselves enthusiasts in physical exercises, 
largely turned upon gymnastics and led to the wonderful perfection of 
the Greek system of bodily culture. The ideal toward which their 
efforts were directed was the perfection of the intellect, the moral 
 
-P-A-G-E-485
  
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 457 
nature, and the body, and they considered the last but little less 
important than the other two. How high their ideal was of physical 
perfection, and how well they attained it, is attested by the marble 
and bronze statues of their gods, heroes, and athletes that have sur- 
vived the ravages of time. They did not understand the true func- 
tions of the muscles and they knew nothing of the circulation of the 
blood. They were, in fact, totally ignorant of the science of physiology 
in its true sense. But they were close and intelligent observers, and 
were aided by an artistic sense more strongly marked in them than in 
any other people under the sun. Undoubtedly the gymnasia did much 
to foster art by supplying models that closely approached perfection, 
and the artists in turn exercised a strong influence over the gymaasia 
by selecting the most perfect parts of different individuals, and uniting 
them, presented new ideals of truer perfection toward which the prac- 
tice of the gymnasia might tend. 
The gymnasia at’ first were kept by private persons only and were 
simply open spaces for exercising. Later, buildings especially designed 
for the purpose were used. They were originally very simple in their 
character, but finally they became state affairs, carefully planned for 
the purposes in view, and minutely regulated by law. 
In Athens there were three only that acquired great celebrity, the 
Academy, the Lyceum, and the Cynosarges, but there were others, at least 
four, of less note. Every city of importance in Greece had at least one 
gymnasium, and no doubt every hamlet was provided with a palestra 
or wrestling place, if nothing more. 
Naturally the gymnasia differed in completeness and elegance, but 
the following description, taken from St. John’s History of the Manners 
and Customs of Ancient Greece, conveys an excellent idea of the Ben 
eral plan, which was common to all: 
The gymnasia were spacious edifices, surrounded by gardens and a sacred grove. 
The first entrance was by a square court, two stadia in circumference, encom- 
passed with porticoes and buildings. On three of its sides were large halls, pro- 
vided with seats, in which philosophers, rhetoricians, and sophists assembled their 
disciples. On the fourth were rooms for bathing and other practices of the gymna- 
sium. The portico facing south was double, to prevent the winter rain, driven by the 
wind, from penetrating the interior. From this court you could pass mto an enclos- 
ure, likewise square, shaded in the middle by plant trees. A range of colonnades 
extended round three of the sides. That which fronted the north had a double row 
of columns, to shelter those who walked there in summer from the sun. The oppo- 
site piazza was called the Xystos, in the middle of which and through its whole 
length they-continued a sort of pathway, about 12 feet wide ana nearly 2 deep, 
where, sheltered from the weather and separated from the spectators ranged along 
the sides, the young scholars exercised themselves in wrestling. Beyond the Xystos 
was a stadium for footraces. '! 
The principal parts of the gymnasium were: (1) The porticoes, furnished with 
seats and side buildings where the youths met to converse. (2) The Ephebeion, 
that part of the edifice where the youth alone exercised. (3) The Apodyterion, or 
undressing room. (4) The Konisterion, or small court in which was kept the haphe, 
1 This paragraph is taken from the Travels of Anacharsis.

    458 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
or yellow kind of sand sprinkled by the wrestlers upon themselves after being 
annointed with the ceroma, or oil tempered with wax. An important part of the 
baggage of Alexander in his Indian expedition consisted of this fine sand for the 
gymnasium. (5) The Palestra, when considered asa part of the gymnasium was 
simply a place set apart for wrestling; the whole of its area was covered with a 
deep stratum efmud. (6) The Sphaeristerion, that part of the gymnasium in which 
they played at ball. (7) Aleipterion or Elaiothesion, that part of the Palestra 
where the wrestlers annointed themselves with oil. (8) The area, the great court 
and certain spaces in the porticoes were used for running, leaping, or pitching the 
quoit (9) The Xystoi have already been described. (10) The Xysta were open 
walks in which, during fine weather, the youths exercised themselves in running or 
any other suitable recreation. (11) The Balaneia, or baths, where in numerous 
basins was water of various degrees of temperature, in which the young men 
bathed before annointing themselves or after their exercises. (12) Behind the 
Xystos and running parallel to it lay the stadium, which as its name implies, was 
usually the eighth part of a mile in length. From the area below, where the run- 
ners performed their exercises, the sides, whether of green turf or marble, sloped 
upwards to a considerable height and were covered with seats, rising behind each 
other to the top for the accommodation of spectators. 
The gymnasium and all the proceedings therein were under the control 
or supervision of a number of officials, of whom the gymnasiarch was 
the chief. Each of these had his special duties to perform, one being 
especially deputed to look after the conduct of the boys. 
THE EXERCISES PRACTICED. 
As would be naturally inferred, the exercises of the gymnasium 
closely followed the contests of the national games, but there were 
others useful in affording muscular development and agility, which 
were accorded a full share of attention in the gymnasia but very lit- 
tle in the games. Of these, the most important were the games at ball, 
for which, as we have seen, a special space was reserved in the gymna- 
sia. These games were played according to fixed rules, but were very 
simple and spiritless as compared with our modern ball games. They 
were practiced by both sexes, but men accustomed to such vigorous 
exercises aS wrestling and leaping probably played ball for a reason 
similar to that which would prompt an athlete of our time to “skip 
the rope.” 
Dancing as a physical exercise was frequently extolled by the Greek 
philosophers, but it was never generally practiced for that purpose. 
The following conversation is reported by Xenophon in The Banquet, 
and is introduced in support of both these statements: 
The boy then began to dance, and Socrates remarked: ‘See how this boy, natu- 
rally beautiful as he is, nevertheless appears still more beautiful when he puts him- 
self into graceful attitudes than he appeared when he was at rest.” ‘You seem to 
me,” rejoined Charmides, ‘‘to be inclined to praise the master who taught him to 
dance.” ‘Such is the case, indeed,” replied Socrates, ‘for I was thinking of even 
something more; I mean that no part of the body is inactive in dancing, but that 
the neck, and the legs, and the hands, are alike exercised, so that he who would 
have his body improved in suppleness should learn to dance; and I,” he continued, 
addressing himself to the Syracusan, ‘‘ would gladly learn the movements of the
-P-A-G-E-487
  
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 459 
dance from you.” ‘ What profit, then, will you gain from them?” asked the Syra- 
cusan. ‘I shall dance, certainly,” replied Socrates.« At this reply all the company 
‘langhed. But Socrates, with a very serious countenance, said, ‘‘Do you langh at 
me? Is it then for this reason that I wish, by exercise, to enjoy better health, or to 
eat and sleep with greater pleasure, or because I desire such a kind of exercise, that 
it may not be with me as with the runners in the foot race, who beconfe stout in the 
legs and narrow in the shoulders, or as with boxers, who become broad in the shoul- 
ders and thin in the legs, but that, exercising my whole body, I may render every 
part equally strong? Or do you laugh at this, that I shall be under no necessity of 
seeking for a companion in my exercise, or to unrobe myself, being an old man, 
before a number of people, but that an apartment which will hold seven couches 
will be large enough for me (as this apartment has now been sufficient for this boy 
to heat himself even to perspiration), and that I shall exercise myself under a roof 
in the winter, or when heat in the summer is excessive, in the shade of the trees? 
Or do you laugh at this that, having a belly somewhat larger than is becoming, I 
wish to reduce it to a more moderate size?” 
In the gymnasia, as well as in those games, the athletes in perform- 
ing their feats were entirely naked. Some recent writers appear to 
doubt this, but numerous vase paintings and references by ancient 
authors conclusively prove it to be true. The following paragraph of 
Thucydides would be sufficient even if no other evidence were avail- 
able: 
The Lacedaemonians were the first to undress themselves in public in the gymnas- 
tic exercises and smear themselves with grease. And formerly, even at the Olympic 
games, combatants contended with girdles around their middle, and it is not many 
years since it ceased to be so. Nay, even now amongst some of the barbarians, espe- 
cially those of Asia, prizes for boxing and wrestling are given, and they wear girdles 
when they contend for them. 
MEDICAL GYMNASTICS. 
The medical side of gymnastics was not overlooked. Galen declared 
him to be the best physician who was the best teacher of gymnastics. 
Herodicus, of Selymbria, was the first to discover the relation between 
exercise and health, and by a happy combination of exercises prolonged 
his own life to a ripe old age though he suffered with a mortal disease. 
Plato described the treatment as ‘educating the disease,” and testifies 
to its efficacy by the complaint that Herodicus was unstatesmanlike in 
keeping alive persons who ought to die because they were no longer 
able to pursue their vocations. Hippocrates claimed the honor of 
being the first to bring the system of medical gymnastics to perfection. 
GYMNASTICS FOR THE YOUNG. 
It is uncertain at what age gymnastic exercises were begun by the 
Greek youth, but undoubtedly the beginning was made very early. 
Plato even expresses the belief that the bodies of unborn infants should 
be exercised by the shakings and movements that may be imparted by 
the mother in walking and riding. . 
Very young children, too, [he says] should be constantly moved about by day and 
night, and the younger they are the more they will need it. But at 8, 4,5, and 6
-P-A-G-E-488
    460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
see years the childish nature will require sports. Children at that age have 
certain natural modes of amugement which they will find out for themselves when 
they meet. * * * But after the age of 6 years the time has arrived for the sep- 
aration of the sexes, the boys live with boys, and girls in like manner with girls. 
Now they must begin to learn, the boys going to teachers of horsemanship, and the 
use of the bow, the javelin, and the sling. 
In the thirty-seventh Olympiad prizes were instituted in the Olym- 
pic games for boys in running and wrestling, and in the following 
Olympiad the pentathlon was also introduced for them. The latter 
was soon discontinued, however, because it was deemed inadvisable to 
subject the youth to the severe training necessary. Boxing was added 
to the contests for boys in the forty-first Olympiad, and the pancratium 
in the one hundred and forty-fifth. 
One of the first steps in the gymnastic training was to accustom 
the youth to endure, naked, the cold of winter, which, by the way, is 
by no means so severe in Greece as with us, and the fiercest rays of 
the summer sun. The Spartans carried this hardening process to 
extremes, and were accustomed to send their boys, clad in a single 
garment, to the mountains to hibernate. 
THE TRAINING OF WOMEN. 
The Spartans, teo, paid more attention to the physical education of 
women than did the people of any other Grecian state, their central 
idea being to train men to be soldiers, and women to bring forth sol- 
diers. Lycurgus, accordingly, instituted gymnastic exercises and con- 
tests for the women no less than for the men. 
Aristophanes gives us an example of an exercise in free gymnastics 
practiced by the Spartan women in the following: Lysistraté, compli- 
menting Lampito’s beauty, says: “My beloved Lampito, how hand- 
some you are; your complexion is so fine, and your person so full and 
healthy; why you could strangle a bull.” *‘Yes,” replies Lampito, 
“T faney I could, for I exercise myself in jumping till my heels touch 
my back.” 
Such strength and such exercises were probably not universal, but 
the statement that no Spartan woman was permitted to marry until 
she had given public evidence of her proficiency in gymnastics is all 
that should be necessary to show that they pursued their exercises 
with great energy and success. 
Plato was a strong believer in gymnastics for women, and frequently 
calls attention to its importance. In his Laws he says: 
Many things have been said by us about dancing and about gymnastic movements 
in general; for we include under gymnastics all military exercises, such as archery 
and all hurling of weapons, and the use of the light shield, and all fighting with 
heavy arms, and military evolutions, and movements of armies and encampments, 
and all that relates to horsemanship. Of all these things there ought to be public 
teachers, receiving pay from the state, and their pupils should be the men and boys 
of the state, and also girls and women, who are to know all these things. While 
 
-P-A-G-E-489
  
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 461 
they are yet girls they should be practiced dancing, in arms, and the art of fighting. 
When they are grown-up women, applying themselves to evolutions and tactics, and 
the mode of grounding and taking up arms, if for no other reason, yet in case the 
whole people should have to leave the city and carry on operations of war on the 
outside, that the young who are left to guard and the rest of the city may be equal 
to the task; and on the other hand (what is far from being an impossibility), when 
enemies, whether barbarian of Hellenic, come from without with mighty force and 
make a violent assault upon them, and thus compel them to fight for the possession 
of the city, great wuld be the disgrace to the state if the women had been so mis- 
erably trained that they could not, like birds, fight for their young against some 
fierce animal, and die or undergo danger, but must instantly rush to the temples and 
crowd at the altars and shrines, and pour upon human nature the reproach that of 
all animals man is the most cowardly. 
THE DECLINE OF GREEK GYMNASTICS. 
But Greek gymnastics, though one of the most wonderful of human 
institutions in its rise, progress, and effects, was nevertheless a human 
institution, and finally perished. 
To assign a cause for its decay is not a difficult task, for its birth and 
its death had their origin in the same source, the Olympic games. The 
glory ot the victor and the substantial rewards that followed victory 
became too great. 
The crown of green leaves, indeed, was still the only reward directly 
given, but that was an empty honor compared with the substantial 
ones showered upon the victor by his fellow-citizens. It then trans- 
pired that men gave themselves up wholly to preparation for the games, 
and three distinct classes of exercises came to be recognized, namely, 
the gymnastic, which had in view simply the development of the body 
or of any of its parts; the agonistic, in which two or more persons con- 
tend against each other; and the athletic, whose sole object was the 
preparation for the national games. 
We have Plato’s authority for it that those who practiced for the 
Olympic games had no time for anything eise. In short, participation 
in them was reduced simply to a profession, the votaries of which were 
by no means of a type which commended itself to the more intelligent 
of the Greeks. 
The games in which kings and nobles had been proud to contend 
were at last contested only by men “ who never cultivated the muses, 
and having no. taste of any sort of learning or inquiry, or thought of 
music, even that intelligence which may have been in them became 
feeble and dull and blind, because never roused or sustained, and 
because the senses were not purged of their mists. And they ended 
by becoming haters of philosophy, uncultivated, never using the weap- 
ons of persuasion; they were like wild beasts, all violence and _fierce- 
ness, aud knew no other way of dealing, and they lived in all ignorance 
and evil conditions, and had no sense of propriety and grace.” 
The better class of the Greek youth, therefore, gradually withdrew 
from the contests, and, being thus deprived of the strongest incentive 
 
-P-A-G-E-490
      462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
to bodily exercise, neglected it. And that neglect paved the way for 
the successive conquests that made Greece a subject nation from the 
time of Philip of Macedon until the treaty of Adrianople in 1829. 
With the spread of the Macedonian influence over Greece the decline 
of gymnastics was a question of only a short time, for the Macedo- 
nians, more like Thracians than Greeks, were fond of the chase and 
warlike sports and despised culture for the sake of cwlture alone. 
The Olympic games continued, indeed, until they were prohibited by 
an edict of Emperor Theodosius in A. D. 394, but the spirit in which * 
they were latterly conducted was far different from the spirit that pre- 
vailed when warring states reconciled their differences ‘under the 
fraternizing influences of the festivals of old Greece in her prime. 
The spectators witnessed the games merely as professional shows, 
feeling no interest in the cambatants further than the desire for an 
exciting spectacle. 
The most commendable of their contests, the pentathlon, fell into 
disuse, and boxing, the most barbarous of all, became the favorite. 
The old rule that none but men of pure Greek blood should contest 
was disregarded, and any who were able to amuse the populace were 
freely admitted. If men in power chose to enter, the other contestants 
would servilely allow themselves to be beaten with scarcely an effort 
in their own behalf. The Roman Emperor Nero, in one celebration, 
was thus permitted to take every prize offered. 
It is no wonder that Theodosius considered the games unworthy to 
continue. 
IL—IN ROME. 
ORIGIN OF THE ROMAN GAMES, 
That the Romans and the Greeks sprang from kindred stock is indi- 
cated in nothing more clearly than in the similarity of their religions 
and in the coincidence of many of their offerings and ceremonies. 
It is not necessary to dwell upon an enumeration of these coinci- 
dences, but among the most impurtant of them is that the agones of 
the Hellenes and the /udi of the Romans were alike acts of worship. 
The occurrences that led to their establishment as periodical events 
were, however, of different character. In the early days of the city 
the Roman generals, in starting out upon a campaign, always performed 
certain religious rites, such as the offering of sacrifices, ete., to gain 
the favor of their gods. At last an old general, more shrewd than his 
predecessors, conceived the idea that the gods might be more attentive 
to his welfare if, instead of tendering all his offerings at the beginning 
of his campaign, he would promise them other acceptable ceremonies 
as a reward in case of his success. 
His campaign was a victorious one, and, true to his promise, he hon- 
   
-P-A-G-E-491
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 463 
ored the gods with games and festal processions as soon.as he returned 
to the city. The artifice, for such it undoubtedly was, commended 
itself to other commanders, and the vow to celebrate games upon the 
successful issue became a regular part of the ceremonies at the opening 
of everycampaign. ‘The Roman armies were usually victorious in those 
days, and in time the games at the end of a summer’s campaign came 
to be a matter ofggourse, and were celebrated whether a signal victory 
had been achieved or not. Finally they became a fixed and legalized 
‘institution, called “1ludi Romani,” and to provide for such a contingency 
as a peaceful year, in which there would be no departing general to 
make the usual promise, the vow was made on the Ist of January of 
every year by the newly elected consuls. 
EARLY CHARACTER OF THE GAMES. 
The games themselves in many respects resembled the Grecian 
agones, as the following description of them shows: 
A festal procession proceeded toward the circus staked off between the Palatine 
and the Aventine, and furnished with an arena and places for spectators; in front 
all the boys of Rome, arranged according to the divisions of the burgess force, on 
horseback and on foot; then the champions and the groups of dancers, each with 
their own music; thereafter the servants of the gods with vessels of frankincense 
and other sacred utensils; lastly the biers with the images of the gods themselves. 
The spettacle itself was a counterpart of war as it was waged in primitive times, a 
contest with chariots, on horseback, and on foot. 
First, there ran the war chariots, each of which carried in Homeric fashion a char- 
rioteer and a combatant; then the combatants who had leaped off; then the horse- 
men, each of whom appeared after the Roman style of fighting, with a horse which 
he rode and another led by the hand, and lastly, the champions on foot, naked to 
the girdle round their loins, measured their powers in racing, wrestling, and boxing. 
In each species of contest there was but one competition, and that between not 
more than two competitors. 
A chaplet rewarded the victor, and the honor in which the simple branch which 
formed the wreath was held is shown by the law permitting it to be laid on the bier 
of the victor when he died. The festival lasted only one day, and the competition 
probably still left sufficient time on that day for the real carnival, at which groups 
of dancers displayed their art and above all exhibited their farces; and, perhaps, 
other representations also, such as competiticns in juvenile horsemanship, found a 
place. 
The honors won in real war also played their part in this festival; the brave 
warrior exhibited on this day the equipments of the antagonist whom he had slain, 
and was decorated with a chaplet by the grateful community just as was the victor 
in the competition.' : 
Notwithstanding the likeness of the exercises of the Roman games 
to those of the Grecian, they differed radically in the character of the 
participants. In the first days of the existence of the games these 
were undoubtedly Romans of the better kind, but as soon as the festi- 
vals began to be events of more than ordinary importance the pro- 
fessional element became prominent.

-P-A-G-E-492
464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Dancing became a common trade at a very early period, and dancers 
were employed at all important religious ceremonials, marriages, and 
| funerals. The games being called into requisition upon ‘similar or 
even the same occasions, it was perfectly natural that the performers 
should soon acquire a professional status similar to that of the dancers. 
This prevented the games from attaining the preeminently social 
aspect that they presented in Greece, and led the Rgmans to despise 
the training whose sole object was, according to their idea, the prepa- 
ration for puerile games that were beneath the dignity of a warlike 
» people. 
MARTIAL EXERCISES. 
Their youth indeed did not lack vigorous muscular development, but 
it was attained incidentally in the practice of military exercises, and 
not by reason of any appreciation of a symmetrically developed body for 
its own sake. The Roman boys ran, wrestled, threw the spear, and 
learned to swim, to fence, and to manage horses, simply because these 
things were useful in battle or in a campaign. After reaching man- 
hood and entering the military life for which the earlier education had 
been a preparation, their training began in earnest. 
The Romans regarded it as requisite that the soldiers of the legion should be fur- 
nished with arms, both offensive and defensive, which were heavier and stronger 
than those of any other people whatever. 
In order that they might be able to wield arms which were heavier than those of 
other men, it was necessary that they should render themselves more than men. 
This they accomplished by incessant labor, which increased their’ strength, and by 
exercises which were calculated to give them dexterity—which is nothing other 
than a just application of the natural force with which men are endowed. 
They were accustomed to the military step; that is to say, to make 20 miles in five 
hours, and sometimes 24, During these marches they had to carry weights of 60 
pounds. They were inured to the habit of running and leaping fully armed. In 
their exercises they used swords, javelins, and arrows which were double the ordi- 
nary weight, and these exercises were continual. ° 
The camp was not the sole military school. There was a place in the city where 
the citizens assembled for martial exercises. This was the Campus Martius. After 
the exercises were over they threw themselves into the Tiber, in order to acquire the 
habit of swimming and to free themselves from dust and sweat.! 
It was not until toward the end of the Republic, when the Romans 
began to understand Grecian customs, that their ideas of physical edu- 
cation underwent a change. Aemilius Paulus, the conquerer and 
despoiler of the Macedonian Empire, was one of the first to provide 
specifically for the physical development of his sons upon a plan not 
strictly military. He was not, indeed, so fully converted as to adopt 
the Greek gymnastic exercises, but he secured the same end by careful 
and systematic instruction in the chase. In other respects he adopted 
Grecian methods in the education of his boys, and even employed Greek 
philosophers, sculptors, and painters to instruct them. His example

-P-A-G-E-493
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 465 
had much to do with the popularity of Hellenic culture which fol- 
lowed. 
Greek slaves were soon universally employed by the wealthier Romans 
to instruct their children, not only in the language of the Greeks, but 
in their literature and general culture as well. 
INTRODUCTION OF GREEK GYMNASTICS. 
- 
Under the influence of this new fashion the contempt for gymnastics 
rapidly passed away and small gymnasia were frequently attached 
to the villas of well-to-do citizens. The first public gymnasium after 
the Grecian plan was erected by the Emperor Nero, and another was 
built by Commodus. The public therme, or baths, were, however, the 
favorite places of resort, and it was in them that the leisure class 
of Romans passed a great part of their time. These therme were 
among the finest structures of Rome, and in the magnificence of their 
appointments surpassed even the Athenian gymnasia. All of them 
had spaces reserved for running, wrestling, walks, and games at ball, 
etc., and men, as well as youths, were expected to take part in the 
exercises, unless some good reason existed for not doing so. 
GROWTH AND LATER CHARACTER OF THE GAMES. 
Notwithstanding all this the essential character of the public games 
as sources of amusements was not changed. Even their religious fea- 
tures became less prominent, and finally were a mere pretext on the 
part of the rulers for catering to the absorbing passion of the people 
for ceremonials and amusements. 
Every important event in the progress of the city was assigned as a 
reason for adding to the length of the celebration of the “Judi Romani.” 
A day was added after the expulsion of the Tarquins in 509 B. C.; 
another after the secession to Sacred Mount in 494 B.C., and still 
another, making four days in all, after the great revolution of 397 B. C. 
The occasions for extending the time still further are not precisely 
known, but evidently no opportunity for doing so was lost, for in the 
second century B.C. they occupied ten days, and this number had 
been still further increased to sixteen during the life of Cicero. 
This festival, be it remembered, occurred every autumn, and though 
the most extensive of all, was, nevertheless, but one of many of similar 
character. The regular festivals established by law occupied even in 
the time of the Republic no less than sixty-four days every year. 
Among these the most important were the ludi plebei, the Apollinares, 
the Cereales, the Megalenses, the Floralia, and the ludi victoria Sul- 
lane, none of which was of less duration than five days. 
In addition to these permanently-established games every extraor- 
dinary event, public or private, was made the occasion for the giving of 
shows and the celebration of games which the whole people witnessed.

  466 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The birthday of the emperors, victories in battle, funerals of great 
men were marked in this way, and in later times not even these occa- 
siens were required to unlock the coffers of the state for the amuse- 
ment of the populace. One hundred and seventy-five games were cele- 
brated in the year 354 A. D. alone. 
The paragraph on a preceding page showing the order of exercises 
in the earlier celebrations is very inadequate as a description of the 
games as they were conducted in later times, and utterly fails to con- 
vey any idea of their character as they appeared when the passion for 
such exhibitions was at its height. 
The old Etruscan belief that human blood should be spilt on newly- 
made graves led eventually to combats between condemned victims 
as a part of the funeral games, and these developed into the well-known 
gladiatorial contests that became the favorite amusement of the Romans. 
Hares and foxes had often been chased in public for the entertain- 
ment of the spectators, but such tame sport was not relished long after 
the people had grown accustomed to the bloody fights of gladiators, 
and the venationes were transformed into desperate encounters be- 
tween men and wild beasts brought from all quarters of the world 
to gratify the passion for variety in methods of shedding blood. Julius 
Cesar introduced sea fights upon artificial lakes, and each such exhi- 
bition that followed surpassed its predecessor in magnitude, until the 
climax was reached in the games of Claudius on Lake Fucinus, in which 
there fought 19,000 men with 100 ships, 50 on each side. 
Probus, in the search for novelty, made an artificial forest in the 
- cireus and filled it with a thousand ostriches, a thousand stags, a 
thousand deer, and a thousand wild boar. The whole people were then 
admitted and allowed to capture and carry away what they pleased. 
Chariot racing never lost its place asa favorite spectacle, and after 
the gladiatorial combats had been suppressed by the Christian emperors 
it became the absorbing passion of the multitude. 
The races were always between the chariots of “ factions,” which 
were legalized corporations of undetermined origin, which owned the 
chariots, bred the horses, and trained the charioteers. Each faction 
was known by the color of its livery, and the people espoused the cause 
of their favorites so eagerly that they formed themselves into parties 
which took the names of the colors of the several factions. So immoder- 
ate was their enthusiasm and so fierce was the enmity between the parties 
that serious conflicts often took place. The most remarkable of these 
occurred in Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern empire, in the 
reign of Justinian. It lasted five days, and in that time caused the loss 
of 30,000 lives, and but for the spirit and firmness of the Empress Theo- 
dora would have deprived Justinian of his throne. 
With such imtemperate ardor for professional exhibitions and with 
the love ofluxury and ease that followed the increase of national wealth, 
the desire for personal physical power on the part of the great mass of
-P-A-G-E-495

the Roman people dwindled away. And this must receive a prominent 
place among the causes that led to the decay and downfall of the 
Roman Empire. 
IIl.—THE MIDDLE AGES AND MODERN GYMNASTICS. 
BODILY EXERCISE PRACTICALLY UNIVERSAL. 
To enumerate the other nations of antiquity that valued and practiced 
physical exercises would be not only a difficult but a fruitless task, 
War was the principal occupation of those days and individual skill 
and bodily strength were the most important elements of success in 
battles, which consisted almost wholly of series of individual conflicts. 
That people was most powerful whose soldiers possessed these qualities 
in the highest degree. Defeat and national extinction followed the 
lack of them just as surely. It naturally followed that he who displayed 
the greatest prowess was favored with the most conspicuous honors 
which his people could give, and the broadest avenue open to ambition 
lay in the cultivation of martial skill and of physical strength, which 
was its necessary concomitant. 
It is therefore reasonably certain that among all, or nearly all, 
ancient peoples bodily exercises of a warlike kind were practiced with 
more or less enthusiasm, although their physiological aspect was of 
minor concern, 
Sports and games, too, requiring to a greater or less extent bodily 
activity may be assumed to have existed among the youth of all races 
and all times. Child nature is the same, whether it is seen in the 
aboriginal forests or in the refinements of modern civilization, and play 
is the natural instinct of childhood. The games of the children of the 
forest are, to be sure, simple and rude, but they nevertheless perform 
as important a part in bodily development as the more complicated 
sports of the British or American boy. Then, since “‘men are but 
children of a larger growth,” there have been few nations in which 
the sports of childhood have not been continued in some form in the 
diversions of maturer years. This is especially true of nations in the 
earlier stages of civilization, for civilization is but the process of 
removing man from the state of nature, and man in his natural state is 
essentially child-like in many of his characteristics. 
But in all sports and games the primary object in view was amuse- 
ment, and the effects upon the physique, although considerable and in 
the main beneficial, were accorded even less attention than were the 
physiological effects, as such, of martial exercises. é 
In many cases undoubtedly the influences of Hellenic ideas were seen 
among tribes which had been brought by war or commerce in contact
-P-A-G-E-496
  468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
with the Greeks,’ but these influences were probably only temporary, 
for there could be no true and lasting appreciation of Greek gymnastics 
where there was not Greek civilization and Greek love of the beautiful. 
On account, therefore, of their practical universality and the general 
lack of a definite and rational plan, it is not necessary to the present 
purpose that an extended description be sought of the methods of mar- 
tial training or of games pursued for diversion among any other of the 
earlier nations. 
ANCIENT GERMANY. 
But a brief mention of some of the customs of the warlike tribes of 
Germany is not only necessary to an understanding of the transition 
to the peculiar institutions of a later period, but possesses a value of 
its own. 
Tacitus is, of course, our principal source of information concerning 
the early Germans, and it is to him that we must turn. 
The Germans, he says, were men of large bodies, powerful in sudden. 
exertions, but impatient of toil and labor, deeming it base and spirit- 
less to earn by sweat what they might-purchase by blood. So warlike 
was their character that they transacted no business, public or private, 
without being armed, and quarrels that arose amongst them generally 
ended in bloodshed. 
It was not customary for anyone to bear arms till his ability to use 
them had been approved by the state. Then in the presence of the 
assembly he was formally invested with a spear and javelin by the 
chief, or his father, or a near relative. By this ceremony he gained a 
position as a member of the tribe and was no longer considered merely 
one of his father’s household. 
There was only one kind of public spectacle among them, and that 
was characteristic of a warlike people, namely, the dancing by naked 
young men amid drawn swords and presented spears. Women were 
treated with consideration, almost amounting to adoration. Their 
advice was freely sought and usually followed, even in such matters 
as joining battle or declaring war. They were not exempt from the 
dangers and privations of war, nor did they desire to be, for it was 
their custom to attend their husbands and sons in battle, encouraging 
them to feats of bravery, binding up their wounds, and sometimes even 
actually taking part in battle themselves. 
Ié was the custom for each chief to surround himself with a large 
body of young men, the flower of the tribe, who devoted themselves 
constantly to his service. They deemed it their duty and their privi- 
lege to aid and protect him in battle, to ascribe-to him all their gallant 
deeds, and to deliver to him the fruits of their victories. 
1 Such instances may be found in the gymnastic games at Chemmis, in Egypt, men- 
tioned by Herodotus, and the games of the Asian tribes mentioned by Thucydides.
-P-A-G-E-497

The chief armed his companions, for such they were called, but their 
only pay consisted of repasts, homely indeed, but plentiful. 
After the invasion of the Gallo-Roman territory many of the customs 
of the Germans underwent a gradual change. Most of the companions 
left the chiefs and occupied lands allotted to them, but were neverthe- 
less expected to render military aid when called upon. Some were 
expected to serve on horseback, equipped with a coat of mail, and were 
called “ caballarii.” 
CHIVALRY. 
From these practices arose the feudal system and the institution of 
chivalry, the name of the latter being obviously derived from the term 
applied to the mounted companions of the German chiefs. 
During the crusades chivalry acquired its full vigor, and its connec- 
tion with the feudal system gradually ceased, while the religious and 
moral features became prominent. 
The investiture of the knight was a survival of the old ceremonial, 
but its nature was changed in accordance with the change that the 
influences of religion had wrought. The candidate for knighthood was 
bathed and clad in a white robe as a symbol of purity; was required to 
fast, to make confession, receive communion, and attend mass; he was 
then questioned as to his purpose in entering the order. ‘The answers 
being satisfactory, his arms were blessed and put upon him, The offi- 
ciating lord then gave him three blows upon his shoulder, saying, ‘‘In 
the name of God, of Saint Michael, and of Saint George, I dub thee 
knight.” 
Along with the strong element of religion that crept into the sup- 
posed principles of knighthood the old German veneration for women 
was retained, and an extravagant devotion to the ladies was insepara- 
bly associated with the love of God in the duties of aknight. But these 
two were but the beginning of a long series of noble qualities that were 
enjoined, Guizot recites no less than twenty-six oaths that were imposed 
at different times between the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries, 
covering altogether nearly the whole gamut of human perfection, but 
insisting more than all else upon bravery, the defense of the weak, 
faithfulness, courteousness, humility, and truthfulness under all cireum- 
stances. 
EDUCATION OF A KNIGHT. 
A regular scheme of education was a necessary accompaniment to such 
an institution. Here, too, may be seen the remains of an ancient Ger- 
man custom. As soon as they reached the age of seven years the sons 
of gentlemen were placed in the castles of the superior lords to be reared 
in the very atmosphere of chivalry. They learned the lessons of love 
from the ladies of the court, and received from them and from the castle 
chaplain whatever of intellectual and religious training was deemed 
 
-P-A-G-E-498
    
   
    
                 
   
                  470 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
fitting and necessary for them. They rendered constant personal serv- 
ice to the lord and his lady, waiting upon them at the table, and accom- 
panying them in their excursions, whether of pleasure or of war. During 
the same time a beginning was made in the training ran the military life 
that lay before them. 
They were taught. to leap over trenches, to launch or cast spears and darts, to 
sustain the shield, and in their walk to imitate the measured tread of the soldier. 
They fought with light staves against stakes raised for the nonce as if they had 
been their mortal enemies, or met in encounters equally perilous their youthful 
companions of the castle.! 
This course of life continued for seven years, during which the boys 
were called pages or valets; after the age of 14 they bore the name of 
squire. The domestic duties of the squire gradually grew less exact- 
ing, and as he approached manhood they were entirely laid aside, and 
his military exercises were assiduously pursued. 
He practiced every mode by which strength and activity could be given to the 
body. He learned to endure hunger and thirst; to disregard the season’s changes, 
and like the Roman youths in the Campus Martius when covered with dust, he 
plunged into the stream that watered the domains of his lord. He accustomed him- 
self to wield the sword, to thrust the lance, to strike with the ax, and to wear 
armor. 
The most favorite exercise was that which was called the Quintain; for it was par- 
ticularly calculated to practice the eye and hand in giving a right direction to the 
lance. A half figure of a man, armed with a sword and buckler, was placed on a 
post and turned on a pivot, so that if the assailant with his lance hit him not on the 
middle of the breast but on the extremities, he made the figure turn round and 
strike him an ill-aimed blow, much to the merriment of the spectators. The game 
of Quintain was sometimes played by hanging a shield upon a staff fixed in the 
ground, and the skillful squire riding apace struck the shield in such a manner as to 
detach it from its ligatures. But of all the exercises of chivalry, none was thought 
so important as horsemanship.! 
              
            
  TOURNAMENTS.    
  The tournaments, however, are the features of chivalry around which 
the most of romance dwells. These were elegant pastimes of Europe 
through all the centuries in which chivalry pervaded it, and as “ splen- 
did and graceful shows” they continued to animate and delight the 
on lookers long after the decadence of the institution that gave them 
birth. 
Tournaments may be considered to have risen about the middle of the eleventh 
century; for though every martial people have found diversion in representing the 
image of war, yet the name of tournaments and the laws that regulated them can 
not be traced any higher. very scenic performance of modern times must be tame 
in comparison with these animating combats.          
          
    
        
             
  At a tournament, the space inclosed within the lists was surrounded by sovereign 
princes and their noblest barons, by knights of established renown, and all that 
rank and beauty had most distinguished among the fair. Covered with steel, and 
known only by their emblazoned shield, or by the favors of their mistresses, a still

prouder_ bearing, the combatants rushed forward to a strife without enmity but not 
without danger. 
Though their weapons were pointless, and sometimes only of wood, though they 
were bound by the laws of tournaments to strike only upon the strong armor of the 
trunk, or, as it was called, between the four limbs, those impetuous conflicts often 
terminated in wounds and death. The church uttered her excommunications in 
vain against so wanton an exposure to peril; but it was more easy for her to excite 
than to restrain that martial enthusiasm. Victory in a tournament was little less 
glorious, and perhaps at the moment more exquisitely felt, than in the field; since 
no battle could assemble such witnesses of valor. ‘‘ Honor to the sons of the brave” 
resounded amidst the din of martial music from the lips of the minstrels as the 
conquerer advanced to receive the prize from his queen or mistress; while the sur- 
rounding multitude acknowledged in his prowess of that day an augury of triumphs 
that might, in more serious contests, be blended with those of his country.’ 
DECLINE OF CHIVALRY AND OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE. 
Chivalry continued to command the respect of Europe until the 
fifteenth century, during which a number of causes conspired to accom- 
plish its downfall. 
The most potent of these was undoubtedly the invention of gun- 
powder, or, to be more accurate, the appreciation of its importance by 
the nations of Europe, for at least two centuries elapsed after its inven- 
tion before it was effectively employed in European warfare. 
But even before the days of firearms chivalry had passed the zenith 
of its usefulness, for the English archers had demonstrated the vulner- 
ability of the lighter armor and had compelled the adoption of suits of 
massive steel plates that well nigh rendered the knights powerless to 
strike a blow,” while the Swiss and Bohemian pikemen had proved the 
faultiness of their. mode of attack. Further, the high character of 
knighthood had been lowered by injudicious sovereigns who conferred 
the order promiscuously upon civilians as well as soldiers. Standing 
armies of mercenaries, too, had arisen, to the great detriment of the 
system whose soldiers had fought for love and glory. 
In conjunction with these circumstances, which deprived the occupa- 
tion of war of so much of its romance and attractiveness, came the 
revival of ancient literature and the invention of the art of printing to 
turn men’s minds into new channels. A reaction followed, and physi- 
cal strength received as much contempt as it had been accorded honor. 
It was associated with the victories of the flesh when the time demanded 
the conquests of the intellect. 
The system of education that arose under the new order of things 
was characterized by an ardent pursuit of classical literature. Latin 
1 Hallam’s Middle Ages, Chap. rx., part II. 
2The truth of the remark attributed to King James I, that ‘‘ armour protected its- 
wearer from injury, but at the same time prevented him from injuring anyone else,” 
is demonstrated by numerous instances in history of warmly-contested battles in 
which the loss was insignificant. In an action between Neapolitan and Papal troops 
in 1486,. lasting all day, not a man was killed.
-P-A-G-E-500
  472 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
was the means of communication between the learned of all nations, 
and the knowledge of Latin that one possessed was his measure of edu- 
cation. 
In the school of Sturmius, the most famous pedagogue of the time, 
“the boys gave five years to the acquirement of pure Latin style; then 
two years more were devoted to elegance; then five years of collegiate 
life were given to the art of Latin speech.”! Greek received some- 
what less attention, but little else was thought of than literary instrue- 
tion, and bodily exercises were utterly neglected. 
SATIRES OF RABELAIS. 
Among the first to protest against this order of things was Frangois 
Rabelais, the French satirist, whose writings are barred from polite 
society by their unrestrained grossness, but whose serious utterances 
‘place him in the front rank of early educational reformers. His work, 
Gargantu a and Pantagruel, was first published in 1532. The hero, 
Gargantua, is first confided to the care of tutors who instruct him 
after the manner of the time in Latin and the arts of disputation. 
Gargantua studies hard, but for all that profits nothing and becomes a 
fool, a dolt, and a blockhead. His father, therefore, engages the wise 
Ponocrates as his tutor. Ponocrates administers a drug which causes 
his pupil to forget all that he had learned under his former preceptors, 
and proceeds with his training after his own fashion. 
That portion of his system which is concerned especially with themind 
is not applicable to our sketch, and must be omitted. The description 
of Gargantua’s physical exercises embraces not only Rabelais’s ideal of 
physical culture, but, in the author’s usual pedantic style, a catalogue, 
apparently, of all the gymnastic exercises known at that time. After 
the morning lecture Gargantua and Ponocrates “went forth into a field 
near the university, called the Brack, or into the meadows, where they 
played at the ball, tennis, and the pelitrigone, most gallantly exercis- 
ing their bodies, as before they had done their minds, AII their play 
was but in liberty, for they left off when they pleased, and that was 
commonly when they did sweat all over their body, or were otherwise 
weary. Then they were well wiped and rubbed, shifted their shirts, 
and, walking slowly, went to see if dinner was ready.” 
After the afternoon’s lectures had been heard they again proceeded 
to the fields, this time in company with a young gentleman named 
Gymnast, under whose direction Gargantua practiced exercises on 
horseback, in armor, in running, hunting, throwing, climbing, ete.?

2The exercises in detail were as follows: 
“He rode a Naples courser, a Dutch roussin, a Spanish gennet, a barbed, or 
trapped, steed, then a light fleet horse, unto whom he gave a hundred carieres, made 
him go the high saults, bounding in the air, free the ditch with a skip, leap over a 
stile or pale, turn short in aring both.to the right and left hand. There he broke

Thus was Gargantua governed, and kept on in this course of education from day to 
day, profiting as you would understand such a young man of his age and good sense, so 
kept to his exercises, may well do, which, though at the beginning seemed difficult, 
became a little after so sweet, so easy, and so delightful that it seemed rather the 
recreation of a king than the study of a scholar. 
MONTAIGNE’S ESSAYS. 
Rabelais’s ideas on education bore little fruit, if any, at the time, so 
far as their practical application was concerned, but in the essays of 
Montaigne, published a few years after, we find many of them divested 
of the filth with which Rabelais overwhelmed them, and placed in sur- 
not his lance; for it is a greatest foolery in the world to say I have broken ten 
lances at tilt, or in fight; a carpenter can do even as much; but it is glorious and 
praiseworthy action with one lance to break and overthrow ten enemies; therefore, 
with a sharp, stiff, strong, and well-steeled lance would he usually force up a door, 
pierce a harness, beat down a tree, carry away the ring, lift up a cuirassier saddle, 
with the mail coat and gauntlet; all this he did in complete armor from head to 
foot. As for the prancing flourishes and smacking poppisms, for the better cher- 
ishing of the horse commonly used in riding, none did them better than he. The 
great vaulter of Ferrara was but an ape compared to him. He was singularly skill- 
ful in leaping nimbly from one horse to another, without putting foot to ground, 
and these horses were called desultories; he could likewise, from cither side, with a 
lance in his hand, leap on horseback without stirrups, and rule the horse at his 
pleasure, without a bridle, for such things are useful in military engagements. 
Another day he exercised the battle-ax, which he so dexterously wielded both in the 
nimble, strong, and smooth management of that weapon, and that in all the feats 
practiceable by it, that he passed knight of arms in the field, and at all essays. 
“Then tossed he the pike, played with the two-handed sword, with the back- 
sword, with the Spanish tuck, the dagger, poniard, armed or unarmed, with a 
buckler, with a cloak, with a target. 
“Then would he hunt the hart, the roebuck, the bear, the fallow deer, the wild 
boar, the hare, the pheasant, the partridge, and the bustard. He played at the 
balloon, and made it bound in the air, both with fist and foot. 
“He wrestled, ran, jumped, not at three step and a leap, not at the hare’s leap, 
nor yetat the almanes; ‘for,’ said Gymnast, ‘these jumps are for the wars alto- 
gether unprofitable, and of no use;’ but at one leap, he would skip over a ditch, 
spring over a hedge, mount six paces upon a wall, ramp and grapple after this fash- 
ion up against a window, of the full height of a lance. He didswim in deep waters 
on his belly, on his back, sideways, with all his body, with his feet only, with one 
hand in the air, wherein he held a book, crossing thus the breadth of the river 
Seine, without wetting it, and dragged along his cloak with his teeth, as did Julius 
Cesar; then, with the help of one hand he entered forcibly into a boat, from whence 
he cast himself again headlong into the water, sounded the depths, hollowed the 
rocks, and plunged into the pits and gulphs, Then turned he the boat about, gov- 
erned it, led it swiftly or slowly with the stream and against the stream, stopped it 
in its course, guided it with one hand, and with the other laid hard about him with 
a huge great var, hoisted the sail, hied up along the mast by the shrouds, ran upon 
the edge of the decks, set the compass in order, tackled the bowlines, and steered 
the helm. Coming out of the water he ran furiously up against a hill, and with 
the same alacrity and swiftness ran down again; he climbed up trees like a cat, and 
leaped from one to the other like a squirrel; he did pull down great boughs and 
branches like another Milo; then with two sharp, well-steeled daggers, and two 
tried bodkins, would he run up the wall to the very top of a house, like a rat; then

roundings better calculated to influence the minds of later and more 
refined generations. Montaigne has this to say of physical education: 
Mothers are too tender and their natural affection is apt to make the most dis- 
_ ereet of them so overfond that they can neither find in their hearts to give them 
due correction for the faults they commit nor suffer them te be brought up in those 
hardships and hazards they ought to be. They would not endure to see them 
return all dust and sweat from their exercises, to drink cold water when they are 
hot, nor see them mount an unruly horse, nor take a foil in hand against a rude 
fencer, or so much as discharge a carbine, and yet there is no remedy; whoever will 
breed a boy to be good for anything when he comes to be a man must by no means 
spare him, even when so young, and must very often transgress the rules of physic. 
It is not enough to fortify his soul; you are to make his sinews strong, for the soul 
will be oppressed if not assisted by the members, and would have too hard a task to 
discharge two offices alone. I know very well, to my cost, how mine groans under 
the burthen, for being accommodated with a body so tender and indisposed as eter- 
nally leans and presses upon her. * * * 
Our very exercises and recreations, running, wrestling, music, dancing, hunting, 
riding, and fencing, will prove to be a good part of our study. I would have his 
outward fashion and mien, and the disposition of his limbs, formed at the same time 
with his mind. 
Tis not a soul, tis not a body we are training up, but a man, and we ought not to 
divide him. And, as Plato says, we are not to fashion one without the other, but 
make them draw together like two horses harnessed toa coach. * * * Inure him 
to heat and cold, to wind and sun, and to dangers he ought to despise. Wean him 
from all effeminacy and delicacy in clothes and lodging, eating and drinking. 
Accustom him to everything, that he may not be a Sir Paris, a carpet knight, but a 
sinewy, hardy, and vigorous young man. 
suddenly came down from the top to the bottom with such an even composition of 
members, that by the fall he would catch no harm. 
“He did cast the dart, throw the bar, put the stone, practice the javelin, the 
boar-spear, or partisan, and the halbert; he broke the strongest bows in drawing, 
bended against his breast the greatest cross-bows of steel, took his aim by the eye 
with the hand-gun, and shot well, traversed and planted the cannon, shot at but 
marks, at the papgay from below upwards, from above downwards, then before him, 
sideways, and behind him, like the Parthians. 
“They tied a cable rope to the top of a high tower, by one end whereof hanging 
near the ground he wrought himself with his hands to the very top; then upon the 
same track came down so sturdily and firm that they could not, on a plain meadow, 
have run with more assurance. They set up a great pole, fixed upon two trees, 
there would he hang by his hands, and with them alone, his feet touching at 
nothing, would he go back and fore along the aforesaid rope, with so. great swift- 
ness that hardly could one overtake him with running; and then, to exercise his 
breast and lungs, he would shout like all the devils in hell. 
“Then, for the strengthening of his nerves or sinews, they made him two great 
sows of lead, which they called alteres; those he took up from the ground, in each 
hand one, then lifted them up over his head, and held them without stirring with 
an inimitable force. 
“He fought at barriers with the stoutest and most vigorous champions; and when 
it came to the cope, he stood so sturdily on his feet that he abandoned himself to 
the strongest, in case they could remove him from his place, as Milo was wont to do 
of old, in whose imitation likewise he held a pomegranate in his hand, to give unto 
him that could take it from him. The time being thus bestowed, and himself rubbed, 
cleansed, wiped, and refreshed with other clothes, he returned.”

         PHYSICAL TRAINING. 475 
But the wisdom of Montaigne was as ineffectual as the satire of Rab- 
elais to check the tendency of the time toward verbalism. The teach- 
ings of Sturmius and the Jesuits molded the education of that period, 
and in that education all the attention that the body received, aside 
from negative precautions for the preservation of the health, consisted 
of walks and occasional excursions. 
MULCASTER AND THE MERCHANT TAYLORS’ SCHOOL. 
There were, to be sure, a few exceptions to this general rule, the 
most notable of them being the Merchant Taylors’ School in London, 
during the time in which the famous Richard Mulcaster was at its head; 
that is, from 1561 to 1586. If the ideas of the master were even par- 
tially carried out, and it is reasonable to suppose that they were, as 
they are expressed in his Positions for the Training up of Children, 
his pupils must have received a course of physical training that would 
compare favorably with anything that is offered in the present genera- 
tion. 
Mulcaster’s book seems to have been heretofore entirely overlooked by 
students of physical training, although it is one of the most remarkable 
of the early works upon the subject. It is more directly in the line.of 
modern thought and practice than any contemporary work, since it 
relates especially to exercises for schools and scholars. It is the pio- 
neer work on school gymnastics. Mulcaster was no more learned in 
classic literature than many other pedagogues of his time, but strangely 
enough of all those who perused the descriptions and praises of the 
ancient gymnastics he was the only one who appreciated their force 
sufficiently to reecho the suggestions and recommend their application 
to the schools. He devised no new system of exercises, and most of 
the best ideas are quoted directly from Galen, Hippocrates, and other 
ancient authors, but in the application of them he certainly deserves 
the credit of originality. His plan of treating the subject is set forth 
as follows: 
    First, I will note somewhat generally concerning all exercises. Secondly, I will 
choose out some special exercises which upon good consideration I do take to be the 
most proper and propitious to schools and scholars. Thirdly, I will apply the cir- 
cumstances required in exercise to every one of them so near as I can, that there be 
no error committed in the executing. For the better the thing is, if it hit right, the 
more dangerous it proveth if it miss that right. Last of all, 1 will show the train- 
ing master how to furnish himself thoroughly in this professed exercising, because 
he must both apply the mind with learning and the body with moving at divers 
times, refreshing himself with variety and changes. 
Under the first head the author showed, as well as his deficient 
knowledge of medical science permitted him to show, ‘ wherein health 
doth consist and how diseases do come; then how health is maintained 
and disease avoided, and how great a part is appointed for exercise to 
play in the performance thereof.” He divided all exercises into those   
-P-A-G-E-504
  476 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
that are athletical for games, martial for the field, and physical for the 
health. 
For health {he says] it is most manifest that exercise is a mighty great mistress, 
whether it be to confirm that which we have by nature, or to procure that which we 
have not by nature, or to recover that, by industry and diligence, which we have 
almost lost by misfortune and negligence. The exercises which do serve to this 
healthy end do best serve for this my purpose, and though an healthy body be most 
apt and active, both for gaming to get wagers and warring to win victories, yet in 
my exercises I neither mean to dally with the gamester nor to fight with the warrior, 
but to mark which way I may best save students who have most need of it, being 
still assailed by those enemies of health which wax more eager and hot the more weak 
and cold that exercise is. 
Mulcaster recognizes three degrees of exercise: First, the prepara- 
tive, which served to qualify the body by degrees tor the main exercise; 
second, the post-parative, following the main exercise to reduce the 
body by gentle degrees to the normal quietness, and, third, the main 
exercise itself, which is inclosed between the two preceding. It does 
not require very keen discernment to see in this the similarity to the 
more modern Swedish practices! 
From “the whole heap of exercises named by Galen and other writers” 
he picks out these as best suited to his purpose for indoor use: Loud 
speaking, singing, loud reading, talking, laughing, weeping, holding 
the breath, dancing, wrestling, fencing, and scourging the top. 
For out of doors he selects: Walking, running, leaping, swimming, 
riding, hunting, shooting, and playing at ball. To each of these exercises 
he gives a full chapter, detailing the benefits to be derived, and showing 
what injuries might follow injudicious use. 
The author then considers in the same thorough manner the six cir- 
cumstauces which are to be considered in exercise, namely, “the nature 
of the exercise which ye intend to use; the person and body which is 
to be exercised, the place wherein, the time when, the quality how 
much, and the manner how.” 
The last chapter, that deals with physical education, is headed— 
An advertisement to the training master. Why both the teaching of the mind and 
the training of the body be assigned to the same master. The incongruities which 
ensue where the body and soul be made particular subjects to several professions. 
That whoso shall execute anything well inust of force be fully resolved of the excel- 
lency of his own subject. Out of what kind of writers the exercising masters may 
store himself with cunning. That the first ground would be laid by the cunningest 
workman. That private discretion in any executor is of more efficacy than his skill. 
Throughout, the work is distinguished by a clear comprehension of 
the subject and a close attention to detail that betokens a practical 
acquaintance that must have been obtained in his school, although no 
direct statement to that effect appears, and the indications are that the 
Merchant Taylors’ was the first_school in the modern sense in which 
physical training found a place. 
But Muleaster left the school after a serious disagreement with the 
Merchant Taylors’ Company, and even if he had placed gymnastics in

the curriculum, it is evident that his successor was not disposed to 
follow up the innovation, for the effects of his labors in that direction 
were certainly not permanent. 
OTHER DEFENDERS OF PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
Martin Luther earnestly advocated physical exercise for the people, 
principally on the ground that it tended to prevent them from falling 
into habits of drunkenness, vice, and gaming. Melancthon and Zwin- 
gli were also believers in gymnastics, and in Trotzendorff’s school at 
Goldberg the boys were permitted to wrestle and to run, but, strangely 
enough, were forbidden to go upon the ice or throw snowballs in winter, 
or to bathe in cold water in summer. 
Other writers appeared occasionally in defense of gymnastics, the 
most notable being Sir Thomas Elyot (1495-1546), Hieronymus Mer- 
curialis (1530-1606), and John Milton (1608-1674). 
Sir Thomas Elyot’s “Boke named the Gouernour” appeared in 1531, 
and, as its title indicates, treats of “the education or fourme of bring- 
ing up of the childe of a gentilman, which is to haue authoritie in a 
publike weale” [commonwealth]. After describing at length the mental 
curriculum which he would have his pupil pursue, the author says: 
All thoughe I haue hitherto aduaunced the commendation of lernyng, specially in 
gentilmen, yet it is to be considered that continuall studie without some manner of 
-exercise, shortly exhausteth the spirites vitall, and hyndereth naturall decoction 
and digestion, wherby mannes body is the sooner corrupted and brought into diuers 
sickenessis, and finallye the life is thereby made shorter: where contrayrye wise by 
, whiche is a vehement motion (as Galene prince of phisitions defineth) the 
healthe of man is preserued, and his strength increased. 
    The exercises he especially commends as most fitting for gentlemen 
are wrestling, running, swimming, the handling of weapons, especially 
the sword and battle axe, and horsemanship. He speaks favorably of 
hunting, hawking, and dancing of the proper kind, and praises archery 
as the best of all exercises for every class of people. 
Mercurialis was an Italian physician whose reputation was already 
great before the publication of his greatest work “De Arte Gym- 
nastica.” ! 
This book is a perfect mine of information relating to ancient gym- 
nastics. It was written in advocacy of exercise as a hygienic measure, 
and its arguments are enforced by facts and testimony from no less 
than one hundred and twenty-three classical authors.’ 
    
'The first edition of this book was issued before the publication of Mulecaster’s 
“Positions,” since that writer quotes freely from it. Other editions bear the 
imprint of 1587, 1601, and 1672, the edition of 1601 being the fourth. 
‘The character and scope of the work may be shown by the following chapter 
titles: 
Book First: Chapter 1, concerning the beginnings of medicine; chapter 2, concern- 
ing hygiene, and what may be drawn therefrom; chapter 3, what gymnastics is, and 
how many kinds; chapter 4, concerning the subject of gymnastics, and the praises 
of it; chapter 5, at what time and in what way gymnastics may be taken; chapter 6, .

Milton’s idea of physical training related principally to preparation 
for warfare, as this extract from his Treatise on Education shows: 
This institution of breeding which I here delineate shall be equally good both for 
peace and war; therefore about an hour and a half ere they eat at noon should be 
allowed for exercise and due rest afterwards. * * * The exercise which I com- 
mend first is the exact use of their weapon, to guard and to strike safely with the 
edge or point; this will keep them healthy, nimble, and strong, and well in breath, 
is also the likeliest means to make them grow large and tall, and to inspire them 
with a gallant and fearless courage, which being tempered with seasonable lectures 
and precepts to them of true fortitude and patience will turn into a native and heroic 
valor and make them hate the cowardice of wrong doing. 
They must be practiced in all the locks and gripes of wrestling, wherein Eng- 
lishmen were wont to excel, as need may often be in fight to tug or grapple and to 
close. And this, perhaps, will be enough wherein to prove and heat their single 
strength. * * “ 
Abvut two hours before supper they are, by a sudden alarum or watchword, to be 
called out of their military motions under sky or covert, according to the season, 
as was the Roman wont; first on foot, then, as their age permits, on horseback, to 
all the arts of cavalry; that having in sport, but with much exactness, and daily 
muster, served out the rudiments of their soldiership in all the skill of embattling, 
marching, encamping, fortifying, besieging, and battering, with all the helps of 
ancient and modern strategems, tactics, and warlike maxims, they may, as it were, 
out of a long war, come forth renowned and perfect commanders in the service of 
their country.

JOHN LOCKE’S UTTERANCES AND INFLUENCE. 
But the influence of each of these authors was at best only temporary, 
and none of them was a link in the chain that connected the ancient 
with modern gymnastics. After Montaigne the next writer that may 
be so considered was John Locke, whose Thoughts on Education was 
published in 1693, 
Locke’s ideas were undoubtedly influenced by the writings of 
Rabelais and Montaigne, and possibly those of Elyot, but whatever may 
have been their source, it is certain that he set them forth in a clear 
and philosophical style peculiarly his own, and though some of his 
recommendations are at variance with the teachings of modern medical 
science, he must be considered as one of the most conspicuous advocates 
of rational physical training. His utterances upon the subject relate 
more to the preservation of the heaith than do those of either of his

predecessors, and in this he was influenced, like Montaigne, by his own 
bodily ailments. In his Essay on Study he says: 
The principal end why we are to get knowledge here is to make use of it for the 
benefit of ourselves and others in this world; but if but gaining it we destroy our 
health, we labor for a thing that is useless in ourhands. *~ * * He that sinks his 
vessel by overloading it, though it be with gold and silver and precious stones, will 
give his owner but an ill account of his voyage. 
His treatise on Education opens in the same strain, the first sentences 
being: 
Asound mind in asound body is a short but full description ofa happy state in this 
world. He that has these two has little more to wish for; and he that wants either 
of them will be but little the better for anything else. 
Locke followed directly in Montaigne’s footsteps in earnestly oppos- 
ing “ cockering and tenderness ” by which he believed most childrew’s 
constitutions are spoiled, or at least harmed. He would have them 
accustomed to endure extremes of heat and cold, and to illustrate the 
possibilities of the human body for endurance cites the Scythian phi- 
sosopher who used to go naked in frost and snow, and the children of 
Malta who are reconciled to the heat by being kept stark naked from 
their cradles till they are 10 years old. 
He believed in the efficacy of swimming and open air exercises gener- 
ally, enforcing his argument with the observation that “if my master 
be always kept in the shade and never exposed to the sun and wind for 
fear of his complexion, it may be good to make him a beau, but not a 
man of business.” The recommendations concerning the body and the 
health are summarized in “these few and easy observable rules: Plenty 
of air, exercise, and sleep; plain diet; no wine or strong drink, and very 
little or no physic; not too warm or strait clothing, especially the head 
and feet kept cold, and the feet often used to cold water and exposed to 
wet.” 
Locke considered dancing, music, fencing, “riding the great horse,” 
and wrestling to be mere accomplishments, and tolerated them only 
because custom made them necessary parts of the breeding of gentle- 
men. 
As to diversion, he offers the following hint: 
‘The weakness of our constitutions, both of mind and body, requires that we should 
be often unbent; and he that will make a good use of any part of his life must 
allow a portion of it to recreation, At least this must not be denied to young 
people, unless whilst you with too much haste make them old you have the dis- 
pleasure to set them in their graves or a.second childhood sooner than you would 
wish. mi 
Perhaps, as I have above said, it would be none of the least secrets of education 
to make the exercises of the body and mind the recreation one to another. I doubt 
not but that something might be done in it by a prudent man that would well con- 
sider the temper and inclination of his pupil. For he that is wearied either with 
study or dancing does not desire presently to go to sleep but to do something else 
which may divert and delight him. 
  After Locke the number of champions of physical exercise increased 
perceptibly, though their efforts were confined largely to the writing of 
books, most of which were deyoted to medical gymuastics.

CHILD LIFE IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. 
About the middle of the eighteenth century, however, evidences of 
general dissatisfaction with the prevailing methods of education became 
apparent. Itis true that bodily exercises were abundant in the schools, 
but, unfortunately, it was the teachers who received the benefit, and 
the pupils served merely as parts of the “apparatus” with which the 
“movements” were connected. The following paragraph indicates 
what manuer of exercises were most practiced: 
About this time died Hauherle, collega jubilaens, at a village in Suabia. During 
the fifty-one years and seven months of his official life, he had, by moderate compu- 
tation, inflicted 911,527 blows with a rod, 124,010 blows with a cane, 20,989 blows and 
raps with a ruler, 136,715 blows with the hand, 10,235 blows over the mouth, 7,905 
boxes on the ear, 1,118,800 raps on the head, and 22,763 nota benes with the Bible, 
catechism, singing book, and grammar. He had 777 times made boys kneel on pease 
and 613 times on a three-cornered piece of wood; had made 3,001 wear the jackass, 
and 1,707 hold the rod up; not to enumerate various more unusual punishments 
which he contrived on the spur of the occasion. * * * He had 3,000 expressions 
to scold with, of which he had found about two-thirds readymade in his native lan- 
guage and the rest he had invented himself! 
Next to the excessive tendency to verbalism in instruction and the 
form of corporeal exercise just mentioned, the most conspicuous feature 
of child life was the costume that the fashion of the time inflicted 
upon them. ‘ Hair frizzled with powder and smeared with pomade, 
embroidered coats, knee breeches, silk stockings, a sword at their 
sides ” completed a dress that was wholly inconsistent with the natural 
activity of children and the cause of untold distress to them. 
JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU. 
The absurdity of these practices had not escaped observation, and 
the time was ripe for the advent of the philosopher whose works were 
destined to wield a wider influence than any other writer who has ever 
appeared in the field of education—Jean Jacques Rousseau. 
The paths previously trodden by Rabelais, Montaigne, and Locke 
were also followed by Rousseau, but where they stopped was but his 
starting place.’ In the preface to Emile he says: 
Among so many writings, which, as it is pretended, have no other end than the 
public utility, that which is of the most important use, the art of forming man, is 
still forgotten. My subject was entirely new, even after Mr. Locke’s treatise, and I 
am much afraid it will beso after mine. * * * 
With respect to what may be called the systematical part of this essay, it is 
nothing more than the progress of nature. 
In these sentences is the key to the whole of Rousseau’s philosophy. 
He contemplated nothing less than a revolt against all the accepted 
practices in education and recourse to the “progress of nature.” 
The care and training of the body necessarily occupied a conspicuous

place in the “natural” system that was the antithesis of the artificial 
methods of the time. 
The following are extracts from the first and second books of Emile, 
and it was in them, as an essential part of the scheme of Rousseau, that 
modern gymnasties had its origin: 
Experience shows us that a great many more children die who have been bred in 
delicacy than others. Provided they do not exceed the measure of their strength 
there is less risk in using them to exercise, than to inaction and indolence. Inure 
their bodies to the intemperance of the seasons, climates, and elements; to hunger, 
thirst, and fatigue; dip them in the waters of the Styx. 
To strengthen the body and make it grow nature has her ways and means which 
ought not to be opposed. You should not compel a child to abide in a place when 
he wants to be gone; nor to be gone when he is desirous to stay. If children be not 
spoilt by ourselves they never have any useless desires. They ought to be suffered 
to leap, to run, and to hollow when they have a mind. All their motions are so 
many wants in their constitutions, which is endeavoring to gather strength. 
The body must bo vigorous to obey the soul; a good servant ought to be robust. 
* * * The weaker the body the more it commands; the stronger, the more it 
obeys. * * * Afeeble body weakens the mind; this gave rise to physic, an art 
more pernicious to mankind than all the disease which it pretends to remove, 
If you desire your pupil should improve in mental abilities, let him improve that 
corporeal strength which is to be subject to their direction. Let his body have contin- 
ued exercise; Jet him grow strong and robust, to the end that he may improve in 
wisdom and reason; let himlaborand toil; lethim halloo out loud, and be in constant 
motion; let him show himself a man by his vigor, and he will soon become such by 
his reason. * * * 
It is indeed a lamentable mistake to imagine that the exercise of the body should 
prejudice the operations of the mind, as if these two actions were not to move in 
concert, and one ought not always to direct the other. * * * 
As for my pupil, or rather disciple of nature, being accustomed to depend as much 
as possible on his own stock he does not apply incessantly to others for advice, much 
less does he make a parado of his knowledge. * * * Incessantly in motion, he is 
obliged to observe a great many objects and to know a variety of effects, he acquires 
experience betimes, he takes his lesson from nature, not from man; he gains instrue- 
tion so much the easier, as it comes unperceived. Thus his body and mind are 
trained to exercise at the same time. Acting up to his own ideas, and not to the 
notions of others, he constantly unites two different operations; the stronger and 
more robust he grows the more he improves in abilities and judgment. This is the 
way to attain to perfections which many consider as incompatible, yet are generally 
possessed by all great men; namely, vigor of body and strength of mind; philo- 
sophic reason with athletic agility. 
Those who have reflected on the method of living among the ancients attribute 
that vigor of body and mind, for which they were remarkably distinguished from 
the moderns, to gymnastic exercises. The manner in which Montaigne supports 
* this opinion shows that he was fully convinced of it. * * * The sage Mr. Locke, 
the good M. Rollin, the learned Fleury, the pedant Cronsaz, though they differ 
widely from each other in everything else, agree, nevertheless, in this single point, 
that it is necessary to use children to a great deal of exercise. Of all their precepts, 
this is the most judicious; and yet it still is, and ever will be, the most neglected. 
A growing body ought to be a full liberty in every part; nothing ought to check 
the motion or increase of the limbs; nothing should be too tight or fit very close, and 
there should be no ligatures
-P-A-G-E-511
    PHYSICAL TRAINING. A83 
There are some kinds of exercise, merely natural and mechanical, which contribute 
to bodily strength without impairing the mind; swimming, running, leaping, whip- 
ping a top, throwing stones, all that is very well; but have we nothing more than 
legs and arms? Have we not also eyes and ears, and are these organs altogether 
superfluous in the use'of those limbs? You are, therefore, not only to exercise your 
bodily strength, but the organs of sense by which that strength is directed. 
The publication of Emile, which occurred in 1762, created a profound 
sensation throughout Europe. Its revolutionary tendencies and its 
inclination toward atheism were such that Rousseau was obliged to flee 
from Paris to escape arrest, was forbidden to enter Geneva under pain 
of incarceration, and his book was burned by the common hangman. 
He was driven from Motiers, a village in Neufchatel, by a mob, and 
finally sought refuge in England. The continental press rose against 
him with unexampled fury. He was called an “impious person,” “an 
atheist,” “a mad man,” “a wild beast,” “a wolf.” 
Nevertheless his teachings did not pass unheeded, and in time they 
wrought a wonderful change in the education of Europe. 
BASEDOW’S PHILANTHROPIN. 
Their first practical application was in the Philanthropin, an educa- 
tional institution established in 1774 in Dessau, by Johann Bernhard 
_ Basedow, under the patronage of the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. 
Here it was that the beginning was made in the abandonment of 
medizeval methods of instruction, and here it was that physical exer- 
cise first found a place in a modern school. 
In the order of exercises prescribed were dancing, riding, turning, 
planing, carpentry, and walking. All these were under the care of 
teachers who conducted them in the earnest spirit that may have been 
looked for in institutions under the influence of the philosophy of 
Rousseau. The boys also ran foot races, wrestled in the open air, etc. 
The preposterous costume of the period was discarded and the pupils 
were clothed in easy and convenient sailor jackets and pantaloons, 
while their hair was cut short and entirely innocent of powder and 
pomade. 
SALZMANN AND GUTSMUTHS, AND THEIR FOLLOWERS. 
The Philanthropin attracted wide attention and was visited by “‘many 
skillful men, citizens of the world, most of whom had come from abroad 
for the purpose.” Other institutions modeled after it arose in all 
quarters. The most notable was that of Salzmann, who had been a 
teacher in the Philanthropin, but left itin 1784 to found the institute at 
Schnepfenthal. Salzmann himself did not enlarge the circle of exer- 
cises which had been practiced at Dessau, but in 1785 he associated 
with him Johann Gutsmuths, and to him confided the direction of the 
gymnastics. 
Gutsmuths, with great care and judgment, worked out asystem of discipline in the 
fullest detail, and at Schnepfenthal there was serious earnestness in the department 
 
-P-A-G-E-512
  484 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
of physical training. The children played, not only for the sake of relaxation from 
the labor of the school, but their bodily exercises were made a necessary part of their 
intellectual training and an indispensable department of instruction in the school.! 
After seven years’ experiments in which he made use, as he says, of 
all that he found out from ancient usages, from the historical remains 
of earlier and later antiquity, all that reflection and sometimes chance 
offered to him, Gutsmuths published the first edition of his work on 
Gymnastics for the Young. This book, the first manual of German 
gymnastics, gained a wide influence and was translated into Danish, 
French, and English.” 
In comparing Gutsmuths’ book with Mulcasters Positions the simi- 
larity between them is striking. Both drew freely from classical sources, 
both were written for schools, and both regard the preservation of the 
health and the attainment of a higher type of manhood as of paramount 
importance. The Englishman lived over two hundred years before the 
German author, and his writings contain many of the fantastic errors 
of the age, but in the judgment shown in the application of the move- 
ments to the special needs of his pupils, and in the sound common sense 
displayed in the conduct of the exercises generally, Mulcaster is not 
one whit inferior to Gutsmuths. The influence of Gymnastics for the 
Young was far greater than that of the Positions, but it was only because 
its publication came at a more opportune time. 
At Dessau in the meantime physical exercises were still continued in 
the original Philanthropin, and in 1794 Vieth, then rector, published 
an Encyclopedia of Bodily Exercises, which was also widely circulated, 
and was, with Gutsmuths’ book, the source from which the most of 
Jahn’s ideas were derived. 
Another of the most influential of the earlier advocates of gymnastics 
was the famous Meierotto, rector of the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in 
Berlin, who in 1790 provided a large area for the practice of gymnas- 
ties, and induced King Frederick William iI to contribute thereto a 
sum equal to about $22,500, 
  
1 Raumer’s History of Pedagogy. 
?In the English edition the work is erroneously ascribed to Salzmann, and hisname 
is placed upon the title-page as its author. It is hard toaccount for so egregious an 
error. But the probable explanation is that the translator was acquainted with 
Salzmann’s Elements of Morality, and knowing that he was principal of the Schnep- 
fenthal Institute, imagined, when he saw so excellent a book ascribed to “Gutsmuths, 
Erzieher zu Schnepfenthal,” that Salzmann had written it under a pseudonym. The 
peculiar name Gutsmuths, which means “ good courage,” no doubt aided to deceive 
the translator. 
The translation is ‘‘ free” to a degree. The translator says, “I have ventured to 
take some few liberties, partly to render it more English, partly to adaptit more to 
the use of the boys themselves, at the same time that I have endeavored to increase 
its practical utility by occasional condensation, alteration, or addition.” 
It is, therefore, no wonder that even such an historian as Charles Henry Schaible 
should fall into the error, and make separate mention of a book by Salzmann and 
another by Gutsmuths, when in reality there had been but one.
-P-A-G-E-513
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. A85 
Nachtegall, stimulated by the work of Gutsmuths, opened a private 
gymnasium in Copenhagen in 1799, and so popularized the exercises 
that they were enthusiastically practiced throughout Denmark. Asa 
result of his work, it was in Denmark that gymnastics was first for- 
mally adopted for the schools and the army. Its introduction in the 
schools was decreed in 1828, and before 1831 all but 174 schools were 
provided with facilities for gymnastic exercises. 
PESTALOZZI, 
Pestalozzi, too, was moved to take up the cause of physical education, 
and he did it in this wise: 
It is such a bodily training as the children of our ancestors had and enjoyed that 
must be given to our children, and the spirit of their popular gymnastics must be 
raised up again. But this is no partial spirit, it submits to no influence from the 
popular festivals. On the contrary, these, if genuine, are only the expression of the 
prevalence of it. It must be just as universally active and visible in households, in 
schools, in the labor of the field, in Sunday sports, and in amusements, as on the Alps 
and at the shepherds’ festivals. Itmust appear in the opinions of the people respect- 
ing their corporeal necessities, and in the care for them. The attainment of this 
object is entirely impossible, unless there is awakened in the young, from childhood 
up, and made universal, a lofty, active, and independent sense of power, and this 
will inspire the child of itself to all which is desirable for the salvation of the father- 
Jand.! 
Pestalozzi introduced physical exercises in his famous institute at 
Yverdun in 1807. As sensible as his views were on the general utility ~ 
of gymnastics, when he came to reduce them to a practical system his 
methods were, to say the least, unique. All the movements were 
directed, not to the muscles, but to the joints. He says: 
The essence of elementary gymnastics consists in nothing else than a series of 
exercises for the joints, by which is learned, from step to step, all that a child can 
learn with respect to the structure and movements of his body and its articula- 
tions. * * * He can acquire this knowledge in the quickest and easiest way by 
means of these questions: What motions can I make with each separate limb of my 
body and with each separate joint of it? * * * How can the movements of sev- 
eral limbs and several joints be combined together?    
FELLENBERG’S SCHOOL AT HOFWYL. 
Physical training received a prominent place in the “ Principles of 
Edueation” of Fellenberg, whose agricultural school at Hofwyl is 
declared by Henry Barnard to have exerted a wider influence than any 
other one institution in Europe or America during the present century. 
Fellenberg says: : 
A great variety of exercises of the body and the senses are employed to prepare 
our pupils for the fulfillment of their destination. It is by means of such exercises 
that every man should acquire a knowledge of his physical strength and attain con- 
fidence with regard to those efforts of which he is capable, instead of that foolhardi- 
ness which endangers the existence of many who have not learned to estimate their 
own powers correctly. ~ * * Pure air, a suitable diet, regular exercise and

repose, and a proper distribution of time are the principal means of physical educa- 
tion. It is as essential that a pupil leave his studies during the time appropriated 
as that he may study during the hours devoted to that purpose. 
Voluntary exercise is to be encouraged by providing suitable games, by affording 
opportunities for gardening, by excursions, and by bathing. Regular gymnastic 
exercises should be insisted on as a means of developing the body. A healthy action 
of the bodily frame has an important influence on both mind and morals. 
FRIEDRICH LUDWIG JAHN AND THE TURNERS. 
All these things—the discussions concerning Rousseau, the work 
and the writings of the ‘“Philanthropists,” the books of Gutsmuths 
and Vieth, the reports of the institutions of Pestalozzi and Fellenberg, 
and the efforts of Nachtegall in Denmark—served to “advertise” 
bodily exercise, and to educate the public mind to an appreciation of 
its value. There was still lacking, however, that popular enthusiasm 
and that general participation in its practice without which it might 
soon have relapsed into its former state of somnolence. But the way 
was prepared for the “Father of Modern Gymnastics,” Friedrich 
Ludwig Jahn. This man was of rugged, aggressive nature, but withal 
possessed of a strong personal magnetism that gave him a wonderful 
hold over his disciples and made him one of the most popular men of 
his time. The story of his work is best told in his own words:' 
During the beautiful spring of 1810 a few of my pupils? began to go out with me 
.into the woods and fields on the holiday afternoons of Wednesday and Saturday, 
and the habit became confirmed. Theirnumber increased and we had various youth- 
ful sports and exercises. Thus we went on till the dog days, when the number was 
very large, but very soon fell off again. But there was left a select number, a 
nucleus, who held together even during the winter, with whom the first turning 
ground was opened in the spring of 1811 in the Hasenheide. 
At the present time many exercises are practiced in company, in open air, and 
before the eyes of all, under the name of turning. But then the names turning 
system, turning, turner, turning ground, and the like, came up all at once and gave 
occasion for much excitement, scandal, and authorship. The subject was discussed 
eyen in the French daily papers. And even here in our own country it was at first 
said, The ancient German ways have brought forth a new folly. But this was-not 
all. Unfavorable opinions sprang up from time to time as numerous as the sands of 
the sea. They had never any reasonable ground, and it was laughable to see how 
they opposed with words that whose works were speaking so plainly. 
During the winter we studied whatever could be got on the subject. And we 
reflect with gratitude upon our predecessors, Vieth and Gutsmuths. The stronger 
and more experienced of my pupils, among whom was my present assistant and fel- 
low-laborer, Ernst Eiselen, made a very skillful use of their writings, and were 
able during the next summer to labor as instructors in turning. Among those who 
then devoted themselves especially to swinging exercises, and afterward assisted 
in the full and artistic development of them and even became thorough masters in 
them, were Pischon and Zeuker, who fell, on the 13th of September, 1813, at the 
Gohrde. 
In the summer of 1812, both the turning ground and system of exercises were

in Barnard’s Journal of Education, vol. 8, p. 196.

enlarged. They became more varied from turning day to turning day, and were 
mutually developed by the pupils in their friendly contests of youthful emulation. 
It is impossible to say in detail who first discovered, tried, investigated, proved, and 
completed one or another exercise. From the very beginning, the turning system 
has shown great community of spirit, patriotic feeling, perseverance, and self-denial. 
Every extension or development of it was used for the common good. And such is 
still the case. Professional envy, the absurd vice of selfishness, meanness, and 
despair, can be charged to no turner. August Thaer, the youngest brother of a turn- 
ing group of three, at that time invented sixty exercises on the horizontal pole, 
which he afterward increased to a hundred and thirty-two. While Thaer, was 
taking care of a sick brother in the field during the war, the same epidemic car- 
ried him off, in 1814, of which his brother recovered. He had before that time 
assisted in the establishment of a turning ground at Wrietzen, on the Oder. Toward — 
the end of the summer exercises of 1812, a sort of association of turners was formed 
for the purpose of the scientific investigation and artistic organization of the turn- 
ing system in the most useful and generally applicable manner. This lasted during 
the whole of that winter in which the French were frozen up during their flight 
from Moscow. In this association the place of manager was, according to my wish, 
filled by Friedrich Friesen, of Magdeburg. * * * 
On the King’s proclamation of February 3, 1813, all the turners capable of bear- 
ing arms entered the field. After long persuasion, I succeeded, at Breslau, in indue- 
ing Ernst Eiselen, one of my oldest pupils, to take charge of the turning institution 
during the war. * * * 
I myself accompanied Hiselen from Breslau to Berlin, at the time when the Prus- 
sian army commenced its march and the capital was already freed from the French, 
and introduced him to the authorities and the principals of schools, who promised 
him all manner of cooperation, and who have ever since shown confidence in him. 
Since that time Eiselev. has been at the head of the turning institution during the 
summers of 1813 and 1814 and the intervening winter, and has conducted the exer- 
eises of those who were too young to carry arms. 
At the end of July, 1814, I returned to Berlin and passed the eet of the summer 
and the first part of the winter in laboring industriously for the improvement of 
the turning ground. During the autumn I had erected a climbing pole, 60 feet 
high, a useful and necessary apparatus for climbing, and, in a level country, indis- 
pensable for training the eye to long distances. In winter, when the volunteers 
returned, bringing many turners with them, the associated discussions upon the 
turning system were renewed. The exercises of all the summer were considered 
and discussed, and the subject elucidated by argument. 
On the escape and return of Napoleon all the turners able to bear arms volun- 
teered again for tho field, only two who had fought during the campaigns of 1813 and 
1814 remaining at home, from the consequences of those campaigns. The younger 
ones, who remained behind, now took hold of the work again with renewed zeal. 
During the spring and summer of 1815 the turning ground received still further 
improvements and enlargements. 
Tn the following atitumn and early part of winter the turning system was again 
made the subject of associated investigation. After the subject had been ripely 
considered and investigated in the turning council, and opinions had been eom- 
pared, experience cited, and views corrected, a beginning was made in collecting in 
one whole all the results of earlier and later labors on the subject, and all the sepa- 
rate fragments and contributions relative to it, a labor which has lastly been revised : 
by my own pen. : 
Although it was only one architect who at first drew the plan, yet master, associ- 
ates, pupils, and workmen have all labored faithfully and honestly upon the strue- 
ture, and have all contributed their shares to it. 
Jahn made the turning association far more than a mere gymnastic
-P-A-G-E-516

organization. The fatherland held the first place in his heart and 
German nationality was his fondest dream. He threw all the warmth 
‘of his passionate nature into his utterances when he addressed his 
turners. <A high standard of morality he insisted upon, but the love 
of Germany was to him the one virtue besides which all others were 
trifles. 
The following is characteristic: 
Bold, free, joyous, and pious is the realm of the turner. The universal code of 
the moral law is his rule of conduct. To dishonor another would disgrace him. 
To become a model, an example, is what he should strive after. His chief lessons 
are these: To seek the utmost symmetry in development and cultivation; to be 
industrious; to learn thoroughly; to intermeddle with nothing unmanly; to permit 
himself to be enticed by no seduction of pleasure, dissipation, or amusement, such 
as are unsuitable for the young. And such admonitions and warnings should be 
given in such terms as to insure a school of virtue from becoming one of vice. 
But, again, it should not be concealed, that the highest and holiest duty of a 
German boy or German youth is to become and to remain a German man, that he 
may be able to labor efficiently for his people and his fatherland, and with credit 
to his ancestors, the rescuers of the world. Secret youthful sins will thus best be 
avoided by setting before the young, as the object of attainment, growth into good 
men. The waste of the powers and years of youth in enervating amusements, 
animal riot, burning lust, and- beastly debauchery, will cease as soon as the young 
recognize the idea of the feeling of manly life. But all education is useless and 
idle which leaves’ the pupil to disappear, like a will-o’-the-wisp, in the waste folly 
of a fancied cosmopolitanism, and does not confirm him in patriotic feeling. , And 
thus, even in the worst period of the French domination, love of king and father- 
land were preached to and impressed upon the youths of the turning association. 
Anyone who does anything foolish or insulting to the German manners or language, 
in words or action, either privately or publicly, should first be admonished, then 
warned, and, if he does not then cease his un-German actions, he should be driven 
away from the turning-ground in the sight of all men. No one ought to entera 
turning association who is knowingly a perverter of German nationality, and praises, 
loves, promotes, or defends foreign manners. 
VARYING FORTUNES OF THE TURNERS’ ASSOCIATION, 
The turners rapidly increased in number, and their organization spread 
over all northern Germany, and even penetrated the southern states. 
Its original direct connection with educational institutions was gradu- 
ally lost, but its members continued to be young men, and for the most 
part students. The strong patriotic impulse with which Jahn imbued 
his followers led them into the agitation for constitutional government 
that was then rife over Europe, but in their youthful enthusiasm their 
zeal outran their judgment, and they carried their boasted devotion to 
the fatherland to the extent of attempting reform where reform was not 
demanded, Their services to Germany had been valuable, but they 
conceived such exaggerated notions of their importance that they 
seemed to imagine that the continuance of the German nation depended 
upon them. This did not fail to arouse enmity, and bitter controversies 
sprung up.' The reactionist ministers, too, realized the political power   
'Raumer’s History of Pedagogy.

PHYSICAL TRAINING. 489 
of the turners’ association, and when Metternich, the Austrian states- 
man, presented to the King of Prussia, in 1818, a set of recommenda- 
tious for the management of Prussian affairs, this was among them: 
The revolutionists, despairing of effecting their aim themselves, have formed the 
settled plan of educating the next generation for revolution. The gymnastic estab- 
lishment is a preparatory school for university disorders. The university seizes the 
youth as he leaves boyhood and gives him a revolutionary training. This mischief 
is common to all Germany, and must be checked by the joint action of the govern- 
ments. Gymnasia,on the contrary, were invented in Berlin, and sprang from Ber- 
lin. For these palliative measures are no longer sufficient. It has become the duty 
of state for the King of Prussia to destroy this evil. The whole institution in every 
shape must be closed and uprooted.! 
The Prussian Government, however, was disposed to favor the gym- 
nasia and the recommendation was not immédiately followed. An 
official inquiry was made into the turning system as it then existed, 
and in the scheme of national education then in preparation by Siivern 
bodily exercise once more found a place. A plan was. drawn up for 
providing the public schools’ with turning grounds in 1819, but this 
had not received the signature of the King when Kotzebue, the Rus- 
sian agent who had been particularly active in his opposition to liber- 
alism, was assassinated by a turner named Carl Sand. This occurrence 
so enforced the arguments of Metternich that the approval of the King 
was withheld from the proposed scheme, and instead, the closing of all 
the turning establishments was ordered, and Jahn himself was impris- 
oned. After a few years the restrictions were removed, but the politi- 
eal activity of the turners caused their organization to be again 
repressed in 1832 and once more in 1848, but since 1860 the association, 
divested of its political aspects, has enjoyed continued prosperity and 
steady growth. Its members now number nearly four hundred and 
fifty thousand, and about half of them are “active turners.” 
SCHOOL GYMNASTICS IN PRUSSIA. 
Popular gymnastics was, as we have seen, at an early period in its 
history, divorced from the schools; school gymnastics therefore did not 
suffer all the vicissitudes of the turning association. 
The introduction of bodily exercise in the state schools of Prussia 
was first discussed in 1804, hd assow made it an essential feature 
in his proposed plan of national education. In 1808 Scharnhorst, Stein, 
aud Humboldt were all favorably inclined to a similar scheme, but the 
wars with the French intervened and prevented the accomplishment of 
any permanent results in either case. The failure of Siivern’s scheme 
in 1819 has just been noted. 
In 1836 a heated discussion was aroused by a paper by Dr. Lorinser, 
published in a medical journal, in which he attacked the methods of 
instruction that prevailed in the gymuasien, or higher school for boys. 
He charged them with overloading the mind of the youth with a mul-

tiplicity of subjects at the expense of their cheerfulness of temperament 
and of their bodily health. The effect of the agitation was favorable to 
gymnastics, and on October 24, 1837, a cabinet order was issued per- 
mitting gymnasties in the schools once more. In 1842 the King of 
Prussia on the combined recommendation of the ministers of education, 
of war, and of the interior, approved a cabinet order that “bodily exer- 
cises should be acknowledged formally as a necessary and indispensa- 
ble integral part of male education and should be adopted as an agency 
in the education of the people.” The same order authorized the estab- 
lishment of gymnastic institutes in connection with the “ gymnasien, 
the higher middle schools, the training schools for teachers, and the 
division and brigade schools in the army.” 
The first active step taken by the Prussian Government in the diree- 
tion indicated by this permissive order was the ordinance of 1844, 
which direeted the establishment of in and eut door gymnasia in suffi- 
cient numbers to supply the requirements of all the higher schools for 
males. It provided that Wednesday and Saturday afternoons should 
be devoted. to gymnastics, and that if practicable the pupils should 
exercise for an hour every day. A normal school for teachers of gym- 
nastics was opened in 1848, but was discontinued after a brief exist- 
ence. In 1851 the Royal Central Gymnastic Institute was established 
for the instruction of army officers and schoolteachers, but in 1877 the 
two branches of its work were divided and a separate school was estab- 
lished for each class of its students. 
In the people’s, or elementary, schools the introduction of physical 
exercises was first decreed in 1860, and in 1862 another order made par. 
ticipation obligatory upon all males unless excused by reason of a 
_ physician’s certificate that the pupil’s health would be injured thereby. 
Girls are not so generally provided for, but in many cities the exercises 
are compulsory upon them as well as the boys. At the present time 
about two-thirds of the schools in Prussia have gymnasiums of their 
own and nearly all the others have some provision for exercising. 
GYMNASTICS IN THE Kggcpom oF Saxony. 
A historical review by Prof. Moritz ZETTLER, of Chemnitz. 
[Translated from the German by L. R. Klemm.; 
The beginnings of organized efforts in behalf of gymnastics in Sax- 
ony may be traced back to the year 1818, when a club of about one 
hundred students of the university of Leipzig devoted two evenings 
per week to exercises in gymnastics. They did this during the summer 
in a garden. During the earlier part of the third decade several aca- 
demic gymnastic societies were formed, the founders of which were stu- 
dents who had come from Berlin, having been Jahn’s pupils. But in

Leipzig, asin other parts of Germany, the agitation against demagogues 
(Demagogenhetze) caused by the assassination of Kotzebue in 1819, 
which for atime tyrannized entire Germany, destined the first organized 
efforts in behalf of gymnastics to an early death. In order to uproot 
this ‘‘evil dangerous to the state,” the police of Leipzig, in 1825, ordered 
the parallel and horizontal bars and other apparatus of the societies 
to be sawed off. This did not prevent the disciples of Jahn from con- 
tinuing their exercises in secret. It is important to note that in 1824 
the educational institute, established by Hander in Leipzig, mentioned 
gymnastics as an integral part of its course of study. All indications 
point to the fact that this institution was the first school in Saxony 
in which gymnastics was fostered. For the further development. of 
physical education in Leipzig, the two, afterward very distinguished 
physicians, Bock and Schreber, were especially active. They familiar- 
ized the people, by means of example, the spoken word, and the press, 
with the aims and efforts of bodily exercise. 
In Dresden a few army fencing masters had made use of parallel and 
horizontal bars in their instruction, but with little effect. The con- 
ditions changed, however, when Joh. Ad. Ludwig Werner (a retired 
army officer) opened a gymnastic hall in 1831 in Dresden, and conducted 
it with great skill. Most of the private and publie schools aided the 
enterprise, so that the number of its pupils soon rose to several hun- 
dreds. Also girls’ gymnastics found much favor. It can not be denied 
that the instruction in gymnastics given by Werner contains much 
charlatanism, but the fact remains that heinduced many noted people 
of authority and influence to examine into the educational merits of 
physical exercise, a thing that had been despised heretofore. 
Almost at the same time (in 1833) Otto Heubner established in his 
native city, Plauen, in Vogtland, a gymnastic hall that was ‘well pat- 
ronized. As a consequence, in other cities of the Vogtland similar 
institutions were opened. 
Werner in 1836 submitted to the Saxon chambers of deputies (Stdnde- 
kammern) two of his works, with the request ‘to take suitable meas- 
ures to secure for physical education of the youth the same considera- 
tion that is given to intellectual education.” The matter caused con- 
siderable discussion in both chanibers. The result was the passage of 
a resolution ‘to introduce gymnastics into all the high and normal 
schools in the Kingdom, and to appropriate 1,500 reichsthaler ($1,125) 
per annum for that purpose.” 
Without delay gymnastics was introduced (in 1837) into all state 
high schools (gymnasia) and training schools for teachers. Though it 
took some time before satisfactory results could be shown, the resolu- 
tion referred to had established something which was destined to be 
of lasting influence. Many years after that, namely, in August, 1876, 
gymnastics was made an integral branch of the course of study in all 
secondary schools (in gymnasia, ‘‘real schools,” and seminaries), oblig- 
   
-P-A-G-E-520

atory for all students, except cripples and invalids. Two hours per 
week was the time appointed for regular gymnastic exercises. At 
present the faculties of these schools have each a teacher who has 
passed the state examination in gymnastics for high schools and con- 
ducts the exercises. Every secondary school of whatever kind in 
Saxony has a gymnastic hall and suitable grounds. A state inspector 
of gymnastics appointed by the minister of education supervises the 
work of physical training in secondary schools of the Kingdom. 
The first institutions for gymnastics were intended for male youth 
only, but from the very beginning men of riper age became interested 
in. physical exercise, and hence boys, youths, and men exercised 
together. When a boy had succeeded by means of good results to 
Decome a “ Vorturner” (a section-leader), he was in some institutions 
by virtue of his position allowed to take part in the deliberations of 
the members. . This led in many towns of Saxony, shortly after 1840, 
to the formation of gymnastic societies for adults only, who, however, 
made it a special object to facilitate and foster physical exercise among 
the boys of their town. They offered special instruction for boys in 
their gymnastic halls, or in some cases placed their own teachers at 
the disposal of the public schools. Soon followed efforts to draw the 
girls into the movement by interesting the parents in the matter, and 
appointing special hours for girls’ gymnastics. The societies which 
did most in this direction were those of Plauen, Leipzig, and Dresden. 
In these cities gymnastics for children reached a high standard of 
excellence. 
Gymnastic societies developed in Saxony especially during the period 
from 1843 to 1848. Fifty-four flourishing societies sent delegates to the 
convention of gymnasts who met November 1, 1846, in Dresden. At 
this time the society at Dresden was the largest; it assumed a leading 
position by affording an example for imitation in its admirable organi- 
zation to all other societies in the Kingdom. Many of its members aided 
energetically the periodical, The Gymnast (Der Turner), which was first 
issued in January, 1846. This publication was so well conducted and 
found so much favor that during the “second German gymnastic fes- 
tival,” held in Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1847, the paper was made the 
official gymnastic organ of entireGermany. The society in Dresden also 
arranged for two courses for the training of gymnastic teachers. The 
society’s propositions to the minister of education concerning the estab- 
lishment of a state training school for gymnastic teachers found official 
approval. The minister announced as early as March 16, 1849— 
That he-considered it his imperative duty to give gymnastics a place of equal 
importance with other branches of public education; that, therefore, he had con- 
eluded to establish a training school for gymnastic teachers who could conduct such 
exercises in the light of pedagogic science, and that he had ordered the necessary 
preparation for the opening of such a school. 
At Easter of 1849 the institution was to be opened, but the insur-
-P-A-G-E-521
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 493 
rection which took place during the following May prevented the exe- 
eution of this plan. Not until October 23, 1850, was the institution 
formally opened, and the principal, Moritz Kloss (who afterward became 
favorably known through his tireless and meritorious exertion in behalf 
of gymnastics), was introduced into his new office. 
The insurrection mentioned was the cause of preventing the contem- 
plated introduction of gymnastics into the lower schools. Many noted 
gymnasts from the different societies for physical culture had partici- 
pated in the insurrection (popularly styled the revolution of 1848-49), 
and after it was quelled an undiscriminating reactionary movement 
against gymnastic societies was inaugurated, so that the heretofore 
remarkable development of gymnastic art was checked, At many places 
it was entirely destroyed, and its practitioners were pursued with 
relentless severity. At the close of the sixth decade life in gymnastic 
societies took a tresh impetus. When preparations were made for the 
third “national gymnastic festival,” to be held in Leipzig in 1863, the 
Saxon societies for physical culture began a vigorous activity, which 
secured the success of the national festival and the societies’ subse- 
quent existence. The wars of 1864 (with Denmark)) and 1866 with 
Austria) impaired the activity of the gymnastic societies in Germany 
but little, and the glorious war-of 1870 offered the Saxon gymnasts 
opportunities, both in the field and at home, for giving energetic expres- 
sion to their patriotism. 
Political discussions have been prohibited on principle in the Saxon 
gymnastic societies. This has enabled them to grow undisturbed by 
polive authority. At present there is in Saxony no city or good sized 
village without at least one gymnastic society; even many small set- 
tlements have a society of that kind. A statistical enumeration of Jan- 
uary 1, 1892, records 615 cities and towns with 757 gymnastic societies 
that have 87,388 members over 14 years of age. Of these, 51,901 are 
active gymnasts, led by 4,597 Vorturner (leaders of sections). If we 
consider the fact that the entire empire had at the same date 4,567 
societies with 447,046 members, of whom 227,628 were active gymnasts, 
it is seen that the Kingdom of Saxony occupies the sixth place in 
regard to the number of societies, the fifth place in regard to the num- 
ber of members, and the fourth place in regard to the number of active 
gymnasts. 
The royal government approached the question of gymnastics again 
in the year 1857 by adopting aset of rules for the examination of teachers 
of gymnastics, and in 1863 it permitted the introduction of gymnastics | 
into lower schools by “recommending it to the local authorities most 
urgently.” But it is to be regretted that few cities and villages availed 
themselves of the opportunity, for, according to the statistical report 
of the German gymnastic union of 1869, the schools of only 27 cities 
and 3 villages, and 4 State schools situated in villages, had obligatory 
gymnastic exercises in their courses of study. Hence not 10 per cent 
\ of the school population received gymnastic training.
-P-A-G-E-522
494 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The new school law of April 26, 1878, admitted gymnastics as a 
“dietetic means of education for boys as well as for girls” among the 
essential branches of study in all the schools. The school authorities 
now began to introduce gymnastics into elementary schools where hith- 
erto it had not been done, Since the law fails to state at what year of 
age the exercises in gymnastics are to begin, the curricula of the differ- 
ent schools and cities vary on this point quite considerably, but it comes 
very near the truth to say that, as a rule, gymnastics begin with the 
fourth year of school, or the tenth year of age. Also with respect to 
the time devoted to physical exercises some differences are noticeable. 
In some communities only one hour per week is given to gymnastics, 
while in the majority two hours are given. 
The transitional regulations issued to secure an effective execution of 
the new school law of 1873 permitted the postponement of the intro- 
duction of gymnastics until 1878 in communities where the necessary 
institutions could not at once be established. The local authorities of . 
many country schools took advantage of this privilege, and after the 
transitional period of five years was passed numerous petitions asked. 
the minister and the house of deputies for a further extension of the 
time. Statistical material gathered by the president of the Saxon gym- 
nastic teachers’ society from the reports of the school inspectors, con- 
firms the fact that only one of the school districts of Saxony has intro- 
duced gymnastics in all its schools; that furthermore in 23 districts a 
number of schools is still without gymnastic apparatus. In 17 of these 
districts no less than 50 per cent (the highest was 93-8 per cent) of the 
schools fail to live up to the law. 
It is the rule in elementary schools (Volksschulen) to have gymnas- 
tics conducted by the regular class teachers. Very few of these schools 
employ special teachers. -In extensive institutions, such as city ward 
schools in Leipzig and Dresden, it has been found expedient to place 
this instruction in the hands of specially trained and experienced 
teachers. 
IV.—PHYSICAL TRAINING IN AMERICA. 
For the first suggestions made in this country relating to physical 
training one must search far back into colonial history. But it seems 
to be certain that a statesman who as much as any other made our 
national existence possible was the first American to propose that 
physical training be made a part of the curriculum of an educational 
institution. That honor appears to belong to Benjamin Franklin. 
Dr. Franklin was fond of exercise from his childhood, swimming 
being the sport in which he excelled and in which he delighted most. 
When a young man in London he distinguished himself by his aquatic
-P-A-G-E-523
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 495 
feats, and seriously considered remaining there to open a swimming 
school. An advantageous offer from a Philadelphia merchant inffu- 
enced him to return to America, and led to the career of usefulness 
with which every well-informed American is familiar. In regard to his 
residence in Philadelphia, Dr. Franklin afterwards said :! 
Thad, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my being established in 
Pennsylvania. Thero were, however, some things that I regretted, there being no 
provision for defense, nor for a complete education of youth; no militia, nor any 
college. I, therefore, in 1743, drew up a proposal for establishing an academy; and 
at that time, thinking the Rey. Richard Peters, who was out of employ, a fit person 
to superintend such an institution, I communicated the project to him; but he, hav- 
ing more profitable views in the service of the proprietors, which succeeded, 
declined the undertaking, and, not knowing another at that time suitable for such a 
trust, I let the scheme lie awhile dormant. x 
In 1749, the circumstances being favorable, he again turned his 
thoughts to the establishment of an academy. His first step was to 
secure the cooperation of a number of active friends; the next was to 
write and publish a pamphlet entitled Proposals Relating to the Edu- 
cation of Youth in Pennsylvania. In this he proposed that some per- 
sons of Jeisure and public spirit be incorporated with power to erect an 
.academy for the education of youth, to govern the same, etc. 
That a house be provided for the academy, if not in the town not many miles 
from it; the situation high and dry, and, if it may be, not far from a river, having a 
garden, orchard, meadow, and a field or two. 
That the house be furnished with a library, maps, mathematical instruments, and 
philosophical apparatus. 
That the boarding schools diet together, plainly, temperately, and frugally. 
That, to keep them in health, and to strengthen and render active their bodies, they be 
Srequently exercised in running, leaping, wrestling, and swimming. 
As to their studies it would be well if they could be taught everything that is use- 
ful and everything that is ornamental. But art is long and their time is short. It 
is therefore proposed that they learn those things most useful and most ornamental; 
regard being had to the several professions for which they are intended. 
And all this, be it remembered, was written before Rousseau’s great 
work appeared and before cither Fellenberg, Gutsmuths, or Jahn was 
even born. 
“This pamphlet,” said Dr. Franklin, “I distributed among the prin- 
cipal inhabitants gratis, and as soon as I could suppose their minds a 
little prepared by the perusal of it, I set on foot a subscription for 
opening and supporting an academy.” 
Thus, by his own personal efforts, was founded in the same year the 
academy which a few years later became the University of Pennsyl- 
vania. One feature upon which the founder laid great stress was the 
“English school,” and the first years of the institution were marked by 
discussions as to the relative merits of English and classical education. 
In the course of time the classics gained the ascendency and Franklin’s 
favorite scheme of an English school was neglected. His later writings 
‘In his Autobiography.

referring to the institution, which have been preserved, were devoted 
principally to this departure from the original plan. His indignation 
on that account probably diverted his mind from the dereliction of the 
managers in other respects, for he does not mention their failure to 
follow his ideas as to the exercises necessary “to keep the boys in 
health, and strengthen and render active their bodies.” But he was 
chairman of the board of trustees upon its organization, and was a 
member for forty years. During the first part of that time, at least, 
it is reasonable to suppose that the physical needs of the pupils were 
not entirely neglected. But if anything was done it was probably 
unsystematic and ineffective, as judged by later standards, and it is 
certain that it was not long continued. 
Franklin’s interest in physical exercise did not wane as his years 
increased, and he referred to the subject several times in his Autobi- 
ography and other writings. He wrote two papers upon‘ the art of 
Swimming which show no diminution of his enthusiasm in that sport, 
and which were liberally used by Gutsmuths and the other founders of 
the German gymnastics. 
THOMAS JEFFERSON. 
Benjamin Franklin was not the only one of the giants of those days 
who advocated abundant exercise in connection with education. 
Thomas Jefferson insisted as strenuously upon it. In 1785 he wrote 
a letter to a young man (Peter Carr) concerning his reading and studies, 
in which he said:   In order to assure a certain progress in your reading, consider what hours you 
have free from the school and the exereises of the school. Give about two of them, 
every day, to exercise; for health must not be sacrificed to learning; a strong body 
makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercise, I advise the gun; while this 
gives a moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise, and independ- 
ence, to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others of that nature, are too 
violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. * * * Walking is the 
best possible exercise. * * * There is no habit you will value so much as that of 
walking far without fatigue. 
To another young man, also a student, he wrote: 
With your talents and industry, with science, and that steadfast honesty which 
eternally pursues right regardless of consequences, you may promise yourself every- 
thing—but health, without which there is no happiness. An attention to health, 
then, should take place of every other object. The time necessary to secure this by 
active exercises, should be devoted to it, in preference to every other pursuit. I 
know the difficulty with which a studious map tears himself from his studies at any 
given moment of the day. But his happiness and that of his family depend on it. 
The most uninformed mind with a healthy body is happier than the wisest valetu- 
dinarian. 
Jefferson did not forget bodily exercise when he came to draft the 
plans for the University of Virginia, in whose establishment he was 
the leading spirit. He wrote the report of the famous “ Rockfish Gap
-P-A-G-E-525
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. A497 
Commission,” which was appointed in 1818 by the Virginia legislature 
to determine the site and character of the future university. In that 
report he says: : 
We have proposed no formal provision for the gymnastics of the school, although 
a proper object of attention for every institution of youth. These exercises with 
ancient nations constituted the principal part of the education of their youth. 
Their arms and mode of warfare rendered them severe in the extreme; ours, on the 
same correct principle, should be adapted to our arms and warfare; and the manual 
exercises, military maneuvers, and tactics generally should be the frequent exercises 
of the students in their hours of recreation. It is at that age of aptness, docility, 
and emulation of the practices of manhood that such things are soonest learned and 
longest remembered. The use of tools, too, in the manual arts is worthy of encour- 
agement by facilitating, to such as choose it, an admission into the neighboring 
workshops. To these should be added the arts which embellish life—dancing, music, 
and drawing—the last more especiuly as an important part of military education. 
These innocent arts furnish amusement and happiness to those who, having time on 
their hands, might less inoffensively employ it. Needing, at the same time, no regu- 
lar incorporation with the institution, they may be left to accessory teachers, who 
will be paid by the individuals employing them, the university only providing 
proper apartments for their exercise. 
The university was not opened for students until March, 1825, and 
the matter of exercise being thus left to the volition of the students 
received no attention worthy of note until the impetus was received 
many years after from sources foreign to the university itself. 
GYMNASTICS FOR THE EARLY MILITIA, 
Mention has previously been made in this paper of the obvious con- 
nection between training in the exercises of war and bodily develop- 
ment. That connection was apparent to those concerned in the conduct 
of the armies of the Revolution, and we frequently find references in 
the writings and recommendations of the founders of the Government 
to the importance of encouraging in the people at large, as well as in 
the soldiers of the armies, an attention to bodily vigor which is so 
essential to an independent nation. Thomas Jefferson’s suggestions 
are an instance. 
Schemes for the better training of those actually in the military sery- 
ice were early to appear. As soon as the British left our shores and it 
became possible to disband the American armies, the question of a mili_ 
tary peace establishment became an important one. As a part of his 
plan, the Secretary of War under the confederation proposed the estab- 
lishment of military academies.' A committee of Congress, with Alex- 
ander Hamilton at its head, opposed this, being “of the opinion that 
the benefits of such institutions rarely compensate for the expense.” 
This was in 1783. In the course of time Hamilton’s opinion changed, 
  
! This office was held by Gen. Lincoln. It is stated by Maj. E. D. Mansfield, in his 
history of the U. S. Military Academy, that Col. Pickering proposed the establish- 
ment of a military academy in 1783. That officer was then connected with the board 
of war, and it is not improbable that the proposition mentioned in the text originally 
emanated from him. 
ED 92———32

498 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
and several years later was earnest in his advocacy of the idea that he~ 
had opposed as being not worth the cost. 
In 1790, Henry Knox, the first Secretary of War under theConstitution, 
matured a scheme for the organization of a national militia which Pres 
ident Washington transmitted to Congress “ for their information.” 
In the introductory remarks, extolling the value of a thoroughly 
organized militia, the following occurs: 
All discussions on the subject of a powerful militia will result in one or the other 
of the following principles: 
First. Either efficient institutions must be established for the military education 
of the youth, and that the knowledge acquired therein shali be diffused throughout 
Be the community by means of rotation, or 
Second. That the militia must be formed of substitutes, after the manner of the 
militia of Great Britain. 
If the United States possess the vigor of mind to establish the fitst institution, it 
may reasonably be expected to produce the most unequivocal advantages. A glor- 
ious national spirit will be introduced, with its extensive train of political conse- 
quences. The youth will imbibe a love of their country, reverence and obedience 
to its laws, courage and elevation of mind, openness and liberality of character, 
accompanied by a just spirit of honor, in addition to which their bodies will acquire a 
robustness greatly conducive to their personal happiness as well as the defense of their 
country; while habit, with its silent but efficacious operations, will durably cement 
the system.” 5. 
The proposed plan divided the citizens of the United States subject 
to military duty into three classes, of which the first, called the 
“advanced corps,” and comprehending the youth of 18, 19, and 20 
years of age, was designed not only as a school in which the youth of 
the United States were to be instructed in the art of war, but also for 
actual service in all cases of exigence. ‘ Annual camps of discipline” 
were to be held in each State. One of the rules proposed for the regula- 
tion of these provided that “ No amusements should be admitted in camp 
but those which correspond with war, the swimming of men and horses, 
running, wrestling, and such other exercises as should render the body 
flexible and vigorous.” 
. Congress took no effective action upon this recommendation, but in 
1792 an act was passed providing for the establishment of a uniform 
militia throughout the United States. Another discussion relative to 
the reorganization of the militia began in 1816. The Acting Secretary 
of War presented a plan therefor to the House of Representatives, 
which was the subject of a well-considered report of a committee whose 
chairman was William Henry Harrison. One paragraph in this report 
is worthy of notice: “A corps of military institutions should be 
formed to attend to the gymnastic and elementary part of education in 
every school in the United States, whilst the more scientific part of the 
art of war shall be communicated by professors of tactics, to be estab- 
lished in the higher seminaries.” 
This suggestion was renewed in 1819, by another committee under 
the same chairman, but nothing was done toward putting it into effect.  
-P-A-G-E-527
  
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 499 
EARLY PHYSICAL TRAINING AT WEST POINT, 
In referring to the act of 1792 establishing the militia system, at the 
time of its passage or soon after, President Washington pointed out 
the lack of “opportunity for the study of those branches of the military 
art which can scarcely be attained by practice alone.” 
In his annual message to Congress in 1796 he recommended in direct 
terms the establishment of a military academy. The original draft of 
this message was written in the hand of Alexander Hamilton, but 
whether Hamilton was the real author of the suggestion is not deter- 
mined, though itis significant that his interest in the proposed military 
academy was Subsequently shown in many ways. In November, 1799, 
Hamilton drew up an elaborate plan for its organization which con- 
templated the establishment of an academy of five schools, one’ to be 
ealled “The Fundamental School,” another “The School of Engineers 
and Artillerists;” another, “The School of Cavalry;” another, “The 
School of Infantry;” and a fifth, “The School of the Navy.” The 
course of instruction proposed included the theory and practice of 
gunnery, the tactics and police of cavalry, equitation, the use of the 
small and broad sword, and the tactics and police of infantry. He 
forwarded this plan to James McHenry, then Secretary of War, with 
a suggestion as to its fitness for legislative action. McHenry embodied 
it almost in toto in his scheme for the reorganization of the Army, and 
as a report of the Secretary of War it was transmitted to Congress by 
President John Adams. This plan, too, was rejected by Congress. 
In 1802 an act creating a new corps of engineers provided that the 
corps, consisting of not more than twenty officers and cadets, “shall be 
established at West Point, in the State of New York, and shall con- 
stitute a military academy.” 
In all these years the idea of a military academy had reference prin- 
cipally, if not entirely, to the better training of persons who were 
already a part of the effective force of the Army, and it was not until 
the passage of the act of April 12, 1812, that the academy became 
what it now is, an institution for training youths to become officers of 
the Army. That act raised the number of cadets in all branches of the 
service to 250, and provided that all might be attached as students to 
the Military Academy at the discretion of the President. The military 
exercises that have been pursued at the Academy are such as would 
naturally be expected at such an institution, though they were at first 
limited by the lack of proper facilities. The first formal course of 
study, prescribed in 1816, comprehended “a general course of tactics; 
a knowledge of infantry duty, to commence with the elementary drill 
of the soldier, and to include the discipline and police of the battalion 
and platoon in all their parts; a knowledge of artillery duty, including 
the artillery drill; practical gunnery; and also all the performance of 
all the regular duties of the camps. Under sword exercise shall be

included the broad sword exercise and the cut and thrust; or small 
sword, either or both, according to cireumstances.” 
This was practically the course pursued for many: years. No horses 
were provided for the use of the cadets until a much later date, although 
urgent requests for such provision were constantly made after 1824. 
The Secretary of War in 1825, James Barbour, in his annual report 
urged the purchase of horses for the Academy, stating that ‘as the 
cadets are confined four years to the Point without horses, the art of 
riding itself must be greatly impaired, if not lost. United with its mil- 
itary advantages will be the exercise it furnishes, so friendly to the health 
of the cadets.” 
Notwithstanding this lack, however, the drills and other exercises 
to which the cadets were constantly subjected had an exceedingly bene- 
ficial effect. The Board of Visitors for 1825 certify that “the youthful 
form nowhere exhibits a finer physical development than it does at 
this seminary, where the appearance of vigorous health and muscular 
energy affords the best testimony of the existence of those regulations 
which were adopted to promote them.” 
Gymnastic exercises other than military drills were not introduced 
at West Point until a much later period. The first official mention of 
the desirability of such exercises occurs in the report of a committee of 
the Board of Visitors in 1826. The committee said: 
Your committee believe that a building is wanted for gymnastical exercises, which 
will serve at the same time for a riding school, a fencing school, and military drill. 
A thorough and careful physical education is of importance to a military officer 
more than to any other person. But it is not yet offered at this Academy. The 
drill during the summer months is sufficient to give the cadets healthful exercise, 
and no more; but during the winter this resource fails, and their spirits and activ- 
ity fail with it. It is proposed, therefore, that a plain building, merely sufficient 
+0 afford shelter, be erected, and that a systematic exercise of the whole person be 
there diligently practiced during the winter, undera gymnastical teacher, who shall 
be provided to superintend it. 
  In the report of the full Board of Visitors the same recommendation 
is made at somewhat greater length. 
This report was written by the secretary of the board, George Tick- 
nor, and is said to have embodied the views of the Superintendent of 
the Academy, Col. Sylvanus Thayer. 
Theesuggestion did not move Congress to immediate action, and the 
Board of Visitors for 1828 renewed the recommendation, enforcing it 
with some of the startling statements that were common at that time 
as to the physicial condition of pupils in educational institutions. 
They say: 
* It is well known to all who have attended to such inquiries that severe mental 
labor without corresponding corporal exercise will undermine the strongest consti- 
tution. The cause of this need not be here investigated. The fact is notorious, and 
has been observed in this place as well as elsewhere. True it is that many of the 
cadets do not die, the mortality being as low as one-sixth of 1 per cent. But it 
is believed that some, after leaving the school, have uitimately fallen victims to the 
sedentary habits which have unavoidably been acquired at this establishment.

Even this did not secure the desired result. 
The next Board of Visitors used still stronger language, and instead 
of confining themselves to the remote results of the lack of the $6,000 
building they desired, they plunged into the subject of the present 
health of the students. 
We learned [they say], that although the cadets are not liable to violent and fatal 
\ diseases, yet their general health does not appear to be as good as would be expected 
from the salubrity of the place in which they live, and the attention paid to their 
food, cleanliness, ete. A very great amount of medicines, such as are administered 
in a torpid state of the digestive organs and in other diseases incident 10 persons of 
sedentary and studious habits, is used at this post. The proportion is believed to 
be much greater than that required for any other military station belonging to the 
United States. We esteem this to arise from a want of sufficient bodily exercise, 
and that it exists principally during the winter season and in the spring. In sum- 
mer and autumn the daily drills and other excitements to bodily exercise are suffi- 
cient for the purpose of health, and the beneficial result is very obvious; but for 
nearly half the year the military exercises are suspended, and the severe winter cli- 
mate.in some measure precludes those of a voluntary nature. The young wen are 
consequently obliged to pass at once from an active state to habits sedentary and 
studious in a common degree, and the evils just intimated must follow as a matter 
of course. In order to alleviate or entirely remove them, we are convinced that a 
building should be erected adapted to winter drills and gymnastic exercises, and 
that these should be regularly required. 
And still this did not avail. All these recommendations evidently 
emanated directly or indivectly from Col. Thayer, and after he was 
succeeded as superintendent of the academy by Col. De Russey in 1833, 
the cause of gymnastics at the academy slumbered peacefully. 
CAPT. PARTRIDGE’S LECTURES AND ACADEMIES. 
   Col. Thayer’s predecessor was Capt. Alden Partridge, a man of great 
energy and greater ambition, whose superintendency covered nearly 
two years, and terminated in 1816, in consequence of dissensions. Capt. 
Partridge was a man of considerable ability, and his life’s work was 
distinctly beneficial to the country in many respects, especially in rela- 
tion to physical education. In 1820 he first delivered his famous 
“Lecture on Education,” embodying the plan which had occupied much 
of his attention during the ten years previous. In this lecture are set 
forth what the author conceived to be the defects of the existing plan 
of instruction. Among them is this: 
Another defect in the present system is the entire neglect in all our principal 
seniinaries of physical education, or the due cultivation and improvement of the 
physical powers of the students. The great importance and even absolute necessity 
of aregular and systematic course of exercise for the preservation of health, and 
confirming and rendering vigorous the constitution, I presume must be evident to 
the most superficial observer. It is for want,of this that so many of our most 
promising youths lose their health by the time they are prepared to enter on the 
grand theater of active and useful life, and either prematurely die, or linger out a 
comparatively useless and miserable existence. That the health of the closest appli- 
cant may be preserved, when he is subjected to a regular and systematic course of 
exercises, I know from practical experience; and I have no hesitation in asserting 
 
-P-A-G-E-530

that in nine cases out of ten it is just as easy for a youth, however hard he may 
study, to attain the age of manhood with a firm and vigorous constitution capable 
of ee exposure, hunger, and fatigue, as it isto grow up puny and debilitated, 
incapable of either bodily or mental exertion. 
Military discipline and military instruction were foremost among the 
remedies suggested; as to the rest, he proposes that— 
  First, the course of classical and scientific instruction should be as extensive and 
perfect as at our most approved institutions, ** * * Second, a due portion of 
time should be devoted to practical, geometrical, and other scientific operations in 
the field. The pupils should frequently be taken on pedestrian excursions into the 
country, be habituated to endure fatigue, to climb mountains, and to determine their 
altitudes by means of the barometer as well as by trigonometry. These excursions, 
while they would teach them to walk (which I estimate an important part of eduea- 
tion) and render them vigorous and healthy, would also prepare them for becoming 
men of practical science generally. * ~* * Third, another portion of their time 
should be devoted to practical agricultural pursuits, gardening, ete. Fourth, a fur- 
ther time should be devoted to attending familiar explanatory lectures on the various 
branches of military science, on the principles and practice of agriculture, commerce, 
and manufactures, on political economy, on the Constitution of the United States 
and those of the individual States. * * * Fifth, to the institution should be 
attached a range of mechanics’ shops. 
In the division of time he proposed that two hours daily be given to 
“military and other exercises, fencing, ete.” 
Upon this plan Capt. Partridge opened the American Literary, Sci- 
entific, and Military Academy at Norwich, Vt., on September 4, 1820, 
It was for several years signally successful and attracted students from 
nearly every State in the Union. In 1825 the institution was removed 
to Middletown, Conn., and in 1828 it ceased to exist. Two other acad- 
emies similar to it in character were established by Capt. Partridge, 
one at Portsmouth, Va., and the other at Brandywine Springs, Del. 
He was influential also in establishing the Norwich (Vt.) University, an 
institution of collegiate grade, conducted upon the same principles as 
his academies. 
This institution still exists, and is the only one of the institutions 
directly founded by Capt. Partridge that long survived him. But his 
work was not in vain. He demonstrated the practicability and value of 
military drill and physical training in schools not strictly technical, and 
the number of such institutions that exist to-day is the best evidence 
of the permanence of the results of his efforts. 
AMERICA’S INTRODUCTION TO GERMAN GYMNASTICS. 
In all the foregoing, with the exception of Col. Thayer’s strenuous 
efforts for the introduction of gymnastics at West Point, the reeommen- 
dations that have been recited, originated with Americans and were the 
result of American experience. Not only were they almost entirely free 
from the influence of foreign ideas, but in at least one instance they 
furnished ideas to those who were engaged in constructing gymnastic 
systems in other lands. But a period was reached when the ideas and      
          
             
-P-A-G-E-531
        PHYSICAL TRAINING. : 503 
systems of aliens were introduced and enthusiastically disseminated. 
The wave of popular interest in gymnastics that swept over Europe in 
the early part of the century spread to this country and bore ® frst 
tangible fruit when Messrs. Joseph G. Cogswell and George Bancroft 
made gymnastics a part of the regular instruction at the Round Hill 
School at Northampton, Mass., in the spring of 1825. The exercises 
were directed by Mr. Charles Beck, a former pupil of Jahn, whose con- 
nection with the school lasted for several years. 
The years 1826 and 1827 were marked by general interest in gym- 
nastics and the establishment of gymnasiums in a number of educa- 
tional institutions. But few of these were under the direction of qual- 
ified persons, and notwithstanding the great enthusiasm with which 
the exercises were pursued and the implicit confidence with which the 
results were anticipated, in actual practice the efforts must have been 
crude in the extreme. The New York High School was one of the 
most conspicuous of the institutions in which gymnastics was a feature 
at that time, and the character of their instruction at first may be 
imagined from the following paragraph, which appears in Dr. John 
Griscom’s ‘‘ Address” at the opening of the school in 1825: 
So far as exercises of this nature [i. e., gymnastics] can be introduced with advan- 
tage we shall take particular pleasure in promoting them; and we anticipate no 
difficulty in finding among our boys those who will be willing and qualified to 
become monitors in instructing others in the arts of leaping, climbing, pitching, 
and in other varieties of muscular skill and exertion. 
This method of instruction was not long continued, however, for, in 
the Second Annual Report (1827) it is stated that the gymnastics had 
been placed “ under the superintendence of an experienced and careful 
teacher.” 
At Harvard University, in Cambridge, Mass., a gymnasium was 
established in the spring of 1826 and was placed in charge of Dr. 
Charles Follen, who had also been associated with Jahn, and who bore 
the title of ‘ superintendent of the gymnasium,” in addition to his desig- 
nation as instructor of German in the catalogue of the university for 
1827~28. For the two years, that is, in 1826 and 1827, the gymnasium 
was favorably looked upon by the authorities of the university, and 
was considered of sufficient importance to merit especial notice in the 
very brief catalogues then issued. But in that of 1828 Dr. Follen 
appears simply as instructor in German, ethics, and civil and ecclesi- 
astical history, and no further mention is made of gymnastics either in 
the list of officers or in the catalogues... 
On July 15, 1826, a meeting of citizens of Boston was held to con- 
sider “the expediency of establishing a school for gymnastic exercise.” 
The city council had granted the use for two years of a piece of land 
“at the westerly end of Boylston street,” and it was stated that “the 
primary object of the gymnastic school would be to furnish opportu- 
nity and means of exercise to the youth of the city. At the same
-P-A-G-E-532

time it would be open to persons of every age who might be inclined to 
.embrace the opportunity for the regular practice of bodily exercise.” 
if th® experiment had been successful it was intended to make the 
gymnasium ‘a department of public education, under the patronage 
of the city.” 
After considerable difficulty in raising the necessary funds the gym- 
nasium was finally opened in September, 1826, but at a location other 
than that offered by the city. The general direction of affairs was 
given to Dr. Follen, of Harvard University, but the real work probably 
fell upon his assistant, Mr. Turner, who was described as “a dis- 
tinguished gymnast of the establishment at Cambridge.” 
Dr. Follen soon found it impracticable to direct two gymnasiums and 
to do justice to his academic duties at Harvard at the same time, for 
after a few months he was succeeded as the superintendent of the Bos- 
ton gymnasium by Dr. Francis Lieber, whose coming to America was 
due to the instrumentality of Mr. John Neal, an American enthusiast 
over gymrastics, then residing in London. Dr. Liebef bore the cordial 
indorsement of his friend and ‘teacher, the great Jahn, and was 
recommended by Mr. Neal as a teacher of swimming, riding, and fencing 
as well as of gymnastics. 
The signal success for the time of the physical training in these four 
institutions gave great impetus to the interest in gymnastics, and at 
least three of the neighboring colleges, namely, Brown, Williams, and 
Yale, soon followed with the provision of apparatus for the ‘most pop- 
ular kinds of gymnastics,” as it was expressed in one instance. Several 
schools of secondary or lower grade also followed suit. Mostof them were 
located in New England, but there were three or four in New York, one 
in Maryland, one in South Carolina, and one in Mississippi, showing 
that, though Boston was the center of activity, interest in the subject 
was by no means confined to one locality. But the knowledge of prac- 
tical gymnastics was in inverse ratio to expectations and enthusiasm. 
So great was the ignorance that prevailed and so unfamiliar were even 
the commonest terms connected with the art that one early writer found 
it necessary to explain at great length what the words “gymnasium” 
and “gymnastics” meant, and how they should be pronounced. 
Dr. Beck published a partial translation of Jahn’s book in 1828, and 
after its appearance that seems to have been the principal source of 
information as to the details of the subject. But even then the wave of 
enthusiasm was rapidly subsiding, and in a few years scarcely a trace 
of it was left. Nor are the reasons difficult to discover. 
The only men in America who were really competent exponents of the 
system of gymnastics then prevailing were the three whose names have 
been mentioned. A rather diligent search fails to discover that any 
other institution than the four named even pretended to have a director 
of gymnastics. Beck, Follen, and Lieber were Germans, and they  
-P-A-G-E-533
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 505 
found the status of gymnastics here far different from what they had 
known it to be in their own country. There gymnastics and political 
agitation had been intimately associated, and enthusiasm for “turffng” 
was affiliated with interest in the spread of liberal ideas in government; 
here physical training was a thing apart from all political concerns and 
the manner of its advocacy was in opposition to the demands of mental 
culture rather than auxiliary to it. The position of a leader in gym- 
nastics, therefore, bore an entirely different aspect in Germany and in 
America, and men of rare intellectual ability and university training 
(two of the trio were doctors of philosophy and the third bore the 
degree of J. U. D.) naturally soon tired of teaching boys to turn som- 
ersaults when the rewards for more intellectual work were so much 
greater and more congenial. 
Lieber’s fame from the first rested upon his reputation, which had 
preceded him, of being a “learned professor” more than upon his work 
in gymnastics. In fact his connection with the Boston gymnasium 
appears to have been due to embarrassing circumstances in which his 
political activity at home had placed him, and it was after his failure to 
secure a hoped-for appointment as professor of German in a London 
institution that he accepted the offer of the Boston people, undoubt- 
edly as a makeshift to serve till more congenial opportunities were 
offered. He took up his literary work soon after his arrival in Boston, 
and was known to later years wholly as the author of the plan of Girard 
College, as a professor in the College of South Carolina, and in Columbia 
College, and as a writer upon economic and _ political topics. 
Dr. Follen’s mental superiority was soon recognized at Harvard, and 
he was made a full professor in 1828 or 1829. The scientific features of 
gymnastics were at that time but little recognized even by its most 
intelligent advocates, and it is not surprising that a man occupying such 
an honorable position should gradually rise, as he probably thought, 
above the drudgery of gymnasties. Dr, Beck was teacher of Latin at 
the Round Hill School, as well as of gymnastics, and probably lost inter- 
est in the latter in the same way that Lieber and Follen did. He, too, 
became a Harvard professor in 1832. 
The rest is soon told. Such extravagant expectations. as prevailed 
concerning the effects of gymnastics must have been followed by dis- 
appointment even under the most favorable conditions, But in the 
absence of all that was necessary to lead to a clear and general under- 
standing of not only the underlying principles, but of the details as 
well, an utter failure was unavoidable. The experience of the Charles- 
ton (S. C.) College, as stated in 1830, was typical: “A system of bodily 
exercise was adopted three or four years ago, and suitable apparatus 
was constructed; but it was not found useful, and the apparatus has 
been destroyed.”

506. EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
THE FELLENBERG OR MANUAL LABOR MOVEMENT. 
Though gymnastics, as it was then understood, or misunderstood, 
proved a disappointment, the agitation in its favor had not been in 
vain, for a wide-spread realization of the necessity for greater attention 
to the physical condition of students in educational institutions had 
resulted. «And as soon as confidence in the power of gymnastics to 
accomplish the hoped-for improvement began to wane new plans with 
the same end in view appeared. 
The study of physiology and hygiene was brought forward as an 
important aid to the preservation of health, and the campaign then 
begun in favor of the introduction of such instruction has been con- 
tinued, though with occasional lapses of interest, until at the present 
time it is required by law in nearly all the States of the Union. 
Fellenberg’s idea of combining manual labor with mental instruction 
did not gain much headway in this country till the collapse of the 
gymnastic movement, and then it was taken up with avidity in the 
apparent belief that in it was to be found the solution of the whole 
problem of physical exercise in educational institutions. This hastened 
the decline of gymnastics, for the advocates of manual labor felt bound 
to destroy the claims of all other systems of exercise before advancing 
the claims of their own. 
Dr. Benjamin Rush, of Philadelphia, was one of the earliest to advo- 
eate agricultural and mechanical pursuits in educational institutions, 
his interest in the matter dating from 1790 at least. The first of the 
“agricultural” or “manual-labor” schools was founded in 1797 at 
Lethe, near Abbeville, 8. C., by Dr. John De la Howe, but it was not 
put in practical operation until about twenty years later. Upon a sim- 
ilar plan the Gardiner Lyceum, in Maine, was established in 1823, a 
“ Fellenberg school” was opened at Windsor, Conn., in 1824, and the 
Maine Wesleyan Seminary at Augusta, was put in operation in 1825. 
But the two most conspicuous institutions in which manual labor 
was a feature were the Oneida Institute of Science and Industry at 
Whitesboro, N. Y., and the Andover Theological Seminary at Andover, 
Mass. In the latter the sole consideration that led to the introduction 
of manual labor was the invigoration and preservation of the health, 
“without any reference to pecuniary profit,” but in the majority of sim- 
ilar institutions the supposed pecuniary advantages of the pian were 
as weighty as the hygienic in determining its adoption. In most-.of 
the institutions the labor provided for was agricultural, and for that 
purpose farms were secured when practicable. At Andover, however, 
all the labor was mechanical, namely, carpentry, box making, and com- 
mon cabinet work, and those schools which followed its example were 
equipped with shops only; others were provided with both farms and 
shops, and the students worked in either or both as occasion demanded. 
The time required for labor was generally between three and four hours
-P-A-G-E-535
  
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 507 
daily, and it was suggested in at least one instance that six hours 
would be still better, but it is not probable that such a suggestion was 
ever reduced to practice. 
In 1829 the manual-labor movement began to assume considerable 
proportions, largely because of the earnest advocacy of Dr. Stephen H. 
Tyng, of Philadelphia, and of Dr. Elias Cornelius, the editor of the 
American Quarterly Register and secretary of the American Education 
Society. Being themselves ministers, their first thoughts were naturally 
turned toward the theological schools, and labor was urged as a neces- 
sary part of the preparation for “soldiers of Christ,” but their horizon 
broadened, and they were soon as enthusiastic in urging its claims upon 
schools for secular instruction as they had been in behalf of the embryo 
ministers. In a few years there was scarcely a State in the Union in 
which there was not a school of some description upon which manual 
labor had been ingrafted as an essential feature, compulsory, or prac- 
tically so, upon all students. 
A meeting was held in the Masonic Hall, New York, June 15, 1831, 
“on the subject of introducing manual labor into literary institutions 
as a system of exercise for students.” Addresses were made by Rev. 
Mr. Gale, one of the principals of the Oneida Institute; Rev. Mr. Frost, 
one of the trustees; Rev. Rufus Anderson, secretary of the American 
board of commissioners for foreign missions, and by Rev. Edward 
Beecher, president of Ilinois College. The principles of manual labor 
as connected with literary institutions were explained, and resolutions 
were adopted declaring that— 
It is indispensable that a well-regulated system of exercise should be introduced 
into all plans of education; * * * that manual labor ought, as faras possible, to 
be introduced into literary institutions as a means of promoting health, diminishing 
the expense of sn education, and cultivating all those qualities in a minister of the 
Gospel, which tue nature of his office requires and the exigencies of the present age 
loudly demands; * * * and thatacommittee be appointed to consider the subject 
of connecting manual labor with the pursuit of literature in general, and ‘to take 
such measures as shall in their judgment be best adapted to promote the establish- 
ment of institutions of this kind throughout our country. 
As a result of this meeting, in the next month, that is, July, 1831, the 
“Society for Promoting Manual Labor in Literary Institutions” was 
- formed in New York, the officers being the same men who had been 
active in the preliminary meeting. They were as follows: President, 
Zechariah Lewis, esq.; vice-presidents, Hon. Theodore Frelinghuysen, 
Rey. James Milnor, Seth P. Staples, esq., Rev. Jeremiah Day, Rey. 
James M. Matthews, Hon. William Jay; treasurer, George Douglass, 
esq.; corresponding secretary, Rev. Joshua Leavitt; managers, S. V.S. 
Wilder, esq., Rev. G. W. Gale, W. C. Woodbridge, esq., Rey. Elias 
Cornelius, Mr. Lewis Tappan, Rey. Samuel H. Cox, Rev. T. H. Gallaudet, 
Mr. Cornelius Baker, Rev. Stephen H. Tyng, Dr. Alfred C. Post; execu- 
tive committee, Messrs. Wilder, Tappan, Cox, Douglass, and Leavitt. 
A general agent of the society was appointed in the person of Mr.

  508 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Theodore D. Weld, who had been connected with the Oneida Institute, 
and was familiar with the details of the new system and enthusiastic 
in its advocacy. In accordance with his instructions Mr. Weld visited 
most of the large towns and leading literary institutions in Ohio, 
Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama, prose- 
euting his inquiries and calling public attention to the manual-labor 
system by public lectures and private conferences with the managers 
of the institutions visited. Wherever he went he was well received, 
and his labors resulted in a great increase in public interest in bodily 
exercise in general and manual labor in particular. 
Mr. Weld made his first report January 10, 1832, and it was pub- 
lished as the report of the society in pamphlet form the following year, 
making the most elaborate presentation ever published in this country 
of the claims of manual labor as a part of an educational system. An 
enumeration of the points discussed in it furnishes a good idea of the 
grounds upon which the new idea was advocated : 
(1) The present system of education makes fearful havoc of health 
and life; (Il) the present system of education effeminates the mind; 
(III) the present system.of education is perilous to morals; (IV) the 
present system of education produces an indisposition to effort and 
destroys habits of activity and industry; (V) the present system of 
education is so expensive that its practical effects are anti-republican. 
From the “facts, reasonings, and testimony presented” he reached 
these conclusions: ‘First, bodily exercise is indispensable to man, 
demanded alike by the necessities of his corporeal, intellectual, and 
moral nature, his individual happiness and social usefulness; and, sec- , 
ond, this exercise should be incorporated into our system of education, 
and alternated with study in all seminaries of learning.” 
It was further asserted— 
(1) This exercise must be taken daily; (2) the studert should spend 
at least three hours daily in exercise; (3) The exercise should be mod- 
erate. : 
This much being settled to the author’s satisfaction, he proceeded to 
discuss the kind of exercise “best adapted to the student, and most 
suitable to be incorporated into a regular system.” 
Walking, riding on horseback, and swimming he allowed to be good, 
but not adapted to use in connection with an institution. Military 
exercises were said to be proper for a strictly military school, but out 
of place in other institutions “until fighting becomes the appropriate 
vocation of man and human butchery the ordinary business of life.” 
Gymnastics received a greater share of his attention, but was disposed 
of, because-— 
  (I) It is dangerous; too violent for persons ordinarily leading sedentary lives. 
(II) It is unnatural; many of the movements required are such as are rarely 
demanded by human circumstances. (III) It is unphilosophical. An individual 
can not be permanently intezested in any active exercise to produce changes in the 
state of other objects. * * * No visible effects are witnessed, and the production
-P-A-G-E-537
  
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 509 
of manifest effects is amain element of interest inmuscular movements. (IV) Gym- 
nastic exercises excite aversion and contempt in the public mind. The people are 
disgusted and repelled by the grotesque and ludicrous antics of the gymnasium. 
They say ‘leave wooden horses to children and monkey tricks to monkeys.” 
It was also objected that gymnastics “affords no pecuniary advan- 
tage; that the exercise benefits only thestudent, makes no contribution 
to the resources of his country, and no addition to the means of human 
subsistence.” 
Manual labor was next considered by the author of the report, and 
was found to be a panacea for all the evils described, because— 
(1) The manual labor system furnishes exercise natural to man. (II) It furnishes 
exercise adapted to interest the mind. (III) Its moral effects would be peculiarly 
happy. (IV) It would furnish the student with important practical acquisitions. 
(V) It would promote habits of industry. (VI) It would promote independence of 
character. (VII) It would promote originality. (VIII) It is adapted to render per- 
manent all the manlier features of character. (IX) It would afford facilities to the 
student in acquiring a knowledge of humannature. (X) It would greatly diminish 
the expense of education. (XI) It would increase the wealth of thecountry. (XII) 
It would do away with those absurd distinctions in society which make occupation 
of an individual the standard of his worth. (XIII) It would have a tendency to 
render permanent our republican institutions. 
All these points were elaborated in an ingenious and plausible man- 
ner, and the arguments of the author were fortified by quotations from 
great numbers of writers who had discussed the subject in its various 
aspects. The objections to the system and the obstacles to its success 
were treated in the same way. 
The preparation of this report was the last official act of Mr. Weld 
as general agent of the society, for at the end of his term of one year 
he resigned and entered a Western institution to pursue his professional 
studies. His place was never filled, and the ‘Society for the Promot- 
ing Manual Labor in Literary Institutions” seems to have done very 
little if anything in the way of active work afterwards. 
The popularity of the subject was of only temporary duration, for the 
objections and obstacles which were so easily disposed of on paper by 
Mr. Weld loomed up to formidable dimensions after a few years’ expe- 
rience. One by one nearly all the institutions in which manual labor 
had been tested found the idea unsatisfactory in practical operation 
and dropped it. 
A few of the semicharitable institutions established during the time 
of the greatest popularity of the plan still exist and still retain the old 
manual-labor feature, and a number of schools have been established 
on asimilar plan, within the last few years, for colored ‘pupils in the 
South. <A great many eleemosynary institutions taroughout the coun- 
try require manual labor of their inmates; but in all these cases the 
old extravagant ideas are laid aside, and the pecuniary gains are 
always the principal and in many cases the sole object in view. 
The causes for the collapse of this form of physical training may be

best told in the words of the same man whose glowing utterances 
were described on a previous page, namely, Mr. Theodore D. Weld. In 
a letter to Mr. Henry Barnard written about 1865, he said: 
Ihave modified in some respects my opinions as expressed in the report, and espe- 
cially as to the amount of pecuniary profit to be expected from the manual-labor 
system even under the most favorable conditions. The practical difficulty in suc- 
cessfully combining labor and study in an institution also seems to me greater and 
more complicated. Labor, whether agricultural or mechanical, in order te be pecu- 
niarily profitable to any considerable extent must be more continuous tuan would 
be consistent with the best conditions of study. So also the pecuniary r con- 
flict with the best physicaland mental. To secure the best result to body and mind, 
the students’ three hours’ exercise daily should be divided into half a dozen portions. 
This with the requisite changes of dress would be impracticable. So too, the exer- 
cise should be more diversified than is practicable. From the different kinds of labor 
such a selection should be made as will mete out to every part of the system that 
exercise which will best minister to its need. To do this effectually would require 
more frequent changes in the kind of work than could consist with much pecuniary 
profit. 
      
THE MOVEMENT FOR PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE. 
It was noted in a previous paragraph that one of the results of the 
agitation for gymnastics during the period of 1825-28 was the advo- 
cacy of the study of physiology and hygiene by school children. Along 
with this there soon came a closer attention to the sanitary and hygienic 
conditions of school life on the part of the authorities of the public or 
semipublic schools of the time which seemed to absorb all the thought 
which they were able to give to the physical condition of the children. 
‘When manual labor fell into disfavor, this phase of the question rose to 
a prominent position among the live educational topics of the time, and 
thenceforth, for a number of years, “ physical education ” was even more 
frequently and earnestly discussed than during the period of 1825-728; 
but “ physical education” had then a much wider meaning than gym- 
nastics alone—so wide, in fact, that gymnastics was almost entirely over- 
looked. $ 
An excellent idea of the meaning assigned to the term “ physical 
education” and the popular attitude toward it at that time may be had 
from the remarks upon the subject in the report of a committee of the 
“Western Literary Institute and College of Professional Teachers,” 
who were appointed to prepare a manual of instruction. This report 
was made to the meeting in Cincinnati in October, 1835, and was 
signed by Albert Picket, sr., E. Slack, E. D. Mansfield, A. Kinmont, 
N. Halley, J. Van Doren, D. L. Talbott. It contained the following: 
(1) In reference to physical education, there is something in the power of the 
teacher as well as the parent. (2) What is in the power of the teacher relates 
to air and exercise chiefly. (8) Air breathed by pupils, as well as all others, should 
be pure, free, and temperate. (4) For this purpose the school room should be 
neither very small nor crowded. (5) It should be surrounded by open ground. (6) 
It should have a free circulation of air in summer, and be moderately heated in win- 
ter. Inthe country there may be too much exposure in the winter, but in towus   
   
 
-P-A-G-E-539
          PHYSICAL TRAINING. 511 
overheating is everywhere the prevailing error. (7) As action is a fundamental law 
of nature, so the exercise of the body is the only counter agent we have for the evils 
occasioned by studious habits. (8) Play and the free and universal use of the limbs 
is natural to children, and it is habit and discipline only that restrains them from 
it; hence, when the hours of study are over they should indulge in this activity of 
body and renew their strength for coming exertions. (9) The ground about the 
schoolhouse should, therefore, be extensive enough to permit free, active sports with- 
out injury to others. (10) Boys should rather be encouraged to play than to study 
in the hours of intermission. (11) They should be encouraged to engage in active 
sports of all kinds rather than sedentary amusements and, if it were possible, to 
learn some useful handicraft; their exercise should not be one which exercises only 
one portion of the body. (12) In these respects the teacher can exercise some direct 
control, but they are not the only ones. By advice and inquiry he can exercise not 
a little influence over another not less important department of physical education. 
(13) The due regulation of sleep often makes the whole difference between industry 
and idleness, and theimportance of early rising is illustrated by too many signalexam- 
ples to be doubted. (14) Over these things—air, exercise, and sleep—the teacher 
has not the whole control, but he has enough, by advice and suggestions to parents 
and trustees, by rewards and punishments over the pupils to make it his duty to 
exert it in a more decided and salutary manner than has hitherto been the ease. (15) 
Over diet and clothing the parent is supposed to be the natural and proper guardian, 
and with few exceptions they are topics upon which the young should think but 
little. 
One of the foremost advocates in behalf of the study of physiology 
was Dr, W. A. Alcott, and an expression of his views may also be 
given as an example of the best thought of the time upon the matter 
of exercise. Before the American Institute of Instruction in Boston 
in 1836 he said in effect: 
It is very difficult to give rules on the subject of physical exercise which should 
be applicable to all pupils. To be nice in the matter each pupil should require a 
different quantity of exercise according to his age, health, habits, and moral con- 
stitution. Many rules might be given which would be applicable to a large num- 
ber of pupils, though the best way is for every teacher to make himself acquainted 
with physiology, and then he could make his own rules and adapt them to existing 
circumstances. I would, however, lay down one rule which is applicable to all 
places, cases, and circumstances. Exercise to be useful to pupils should be such as 
will call off the mind from its common pursuits or studies. It is not sufficient to 
exercise the muscles; the mind too must be exercised and even amused. I would 
not say that it is of no use to saw wood or to walk to a certain corner or a certain 
post every day. I believe that even this is of some service. But it is of little avail, 
compared with something which would at the same time interest and excite the 
mind, The pupil should bury, as it were, all his usual employments, in order to 
get the full benefit of the exercise. 
These extracts are sufficient to show the place which the exercise 
held in the estimation of the educational leaders of the time. To pre- 
sent an array of the advocates of similar ideas would be useless 
to show more than the extent of their prevalence, and this may be 
readily understood without such a category. It is sufficient that 
Massachusetts early came to the front as a leader in this movement as 
she had in the gymnastic agitation of 1825~28, and, in a less degree, 
the spread of the manual-labor idea. Horace Mann was one of the 
stoutest defenders and promoters of the study of physiology, and his

reports as secretary of the state board of education teem with recom- 
mendations and arguments in its favor. 
The desideratum most apparent to one of the present generation who 
reads the literature of “‘ physical education” of that time was a well- 
considered system of gymnastics. Physical exercise and recreation 
were prominent in all the discussions, but during that period it was all 
physiology and no practice, just as in the twenties it had been all 
practice and no physiology. The matter of exercise was left either to 
the pupils themselves, as was apparently the idea of the meeting at 
Cincinnati, or, as Dr. Alcott and the New England teachers proposed, 
it was left to the teachers, who can not be supposed to have had more 
than a superficial knowledge of general physiology, even if they had 
that. 
THE REVIVAL OF GYMNASTICS. 
The revival of gymnastics under such circumstances was the most 
natural thing in the world. Effective exercise was desired, and only a 
few years’ experience had been needed to show how futile it was to 
expect anything from such arrangements as had been in vogue; manual 
labor had but recently shown itself to be unsatisfactory as an adjunct 
to a literary institution; what, then, could supply the need so well as 
gymnastics? 
It is not to be supposed that the cause of gymnastics was dead 
during the few years’ reign of the manual-labor idea, or during the 
time that physiology held the popular interest; it was sleeping rather 
soundly, it is true, but an occasional lecture or publication gave evi- 
dence that there was still some life in it. 
In 1830, one William Fuller published in New York a small book 
containing a brief dissertation upon the advantages of gymnastics, an 
account of the London Gymnastic Society, and a description of some 
of the principal gymnastic exercises. He proposed, in conclusion, to 
establish a gymnasium in New York as soon as 100 subscribers were 
obtained at $20 a year each. There is little probability that he ever 
succeeded. 
Gymnastics for females had never received much attention in this 
country, but a small book published in London in 1827, by an Italian, 
Signor Voarino, and entitled A Treatise on Calisthenic Exercises 
arranged for the Private Tuition of Ladies, seems to have had some 
circulation in this country, for it was referred to in some of the educa- 
tional journals of the time, and in one or two advertisements of schools 
for girls mention appears of ‘calishenics.” 
Miss Catherine E. Beecher was one of those who favored calisthenics 
and made it a feature of her school at Hartford, Conn., and afterwards 
at Cincinnati, Ohio, and still later at Milwaukee, Wis. In 1832 she her- 
self published a book in the form of a series of letters, called A Course 
of Calisthenics for Young:Ladies in Schools and Families. A little 
 
-P-A-G-E-541
  PHYSICAL TRAINING, 513 
manual on the same subject was published in 1834 by Rey. J. Leavitt, 
of New York City, who had been one of the executive committee of the 
Society for Promoting Manual Labor, etc. He claimed for calisthenics: 
(1) They bring every part of the system into action. (2) They expand the chest. 
(3) They bring down the shoulders. (4) They make the form erect. (5) Give grace 
to motion. (6) Increase muscular strength. (7) Give a light and elastie step in 
walking. \(8) Prevent tight lacing. (9) Restore the weakened and distorted mem- 
bers of the system. (10) Promote cheerfulness and bodily activity. (11) Render 
the mind more active. (12) They are conducive to general health. 
The apparatus required were “the oscillator, the triangle, patent 
springs, wands, weights, and dumb-bells.” i 
These two little books, with other manuals that appeared about the 
same time, gave a slight and temporary impetus to calisthenics, but 
achieved no permanent result then apparent. 
The Canadians settled upon a plan of practical work ‘sooner than 
the Americans did; and under Rey, E. Ryerson, the chief superin- 
tendent of schools of Upper Canada, a substantial advance was made 
in the actual work of gymnastics before the new movement, as it might — 
be called once more, had passed the stage of discussion in the United 
States. ' 
In 1846, Dr. Ryerson made an official report on a system of publie 
elementary instruction for Upper Canada, which contained a strong 
recommendation of gymnastics. About the same time the government 
of Upper Canada established a public gymnasium in Toronto. In 1852, 
Dr. Ryerson published in his official organ, the “Journal of Education,” 
a series of articles in which he gave a short but reasonably complete 
collection of exercises in free gymnastics and for the horizontal bar and 
the wooden horse. These were afterward collected in pamphlet form, and 
distributed from the educational depository at Toronto. He urged the 
general use of these exercises, and promised the aid of the Government 
in the purchase of apparatus. When the new normal school for Upper 
Canada was opened, November 24, 1852, a gymnasium was a part of 
its equipment, and a “master of-the art of gymnastics” Was in charge. 
There can be no doubt that in all this Canada was in advance of the 
United States, and, judged by later standards, even Horace Mann’s 
work for “physical education” was far less practical and effective than 
that of Dr. Ryerson. 
After 1850 the discussions and suggestio:s relating to phy vical 
training began to assume a perceptibly different aspect, and were: dis- 
tinctly more businesslike and to the point. This was particularly true 
of the utterances of the city school superintendents, whose employment 
was then-a novelty. It is well known that to the system of profes- 
sional supervision of common schools many of the most important : . . : . d . 
improvements in American education are due; the idea of gymnastics. 
for schools can not of course be ascribed to that source, but a very 
superficial examination of the school reports issued during the decade 
ED $2——33 «

  514 : = EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
of 1850 to 1860 would be sufficient to verify the statement that the 
superintendents were influential factors in the gymnastic revival of 
that period. < ; 
Mr, Nathan Bishop, to whom belongs the honor of being the first 
city school superintendent in this country, was also the first superin- 
tendent to advise systematic physical exercises in the school room. 
His experience as a superintendent began in Providence, RB. I., but the 
first expression even reasonably full of his views in this respect is to 
be found in his second annual report as superintendent of public schools 
of the city of Boston (1852). He says: 
In addition to the exercise allowed at the time of recess each half day, all the 
younger children need provision for some gentle exercise as often as once in every 
half hour, such as riding, walking, marching, accompanied with such motions of 
the arms as would tend to give fullness and erectness to the chest. 
Mr. Bishop lamented the lack of a “manual containing such a series 
of physical exercises as would tend to promote strength of body and 
gracefulness of motion;” and it may be assumed therefore that the rule 
promulgated by the school committee the next year (i. e., 1853) requiring 
that “‘every scholar should have daily some kind of physieal or gym- 
nastic exercise,” contemplated such exercise as “rising, walking, and 
marching accompanied with motions of the arms.” This rule probably 
amounted to very little; Mr. Bishop did not make any mention of it in 
his subsequent reports, but it is nevertheless the first rule (so far as 
the writer has been able to discover) which required gymnastic exer-. 
cise in the public schools of any American city. 
A few years later the reports of the superintendents are noticeably 
prolific in physical-training literature. Whether this may be ascribed 
to the influence of the North American Turnerbund, the German gym- 
nastic association which was organized a comparatively short time 
before, or to the fact that the new public-school system had then 
reached such a point as to make it possible for the first time for its offi- 
-cers to look beyond the administrative questions that had absorbed all 
their attention during the period of organization, or to other cireum- 
stances not apparent at this time, can not be definitely stated. It is 
highly probable that causes coming under all these heads were opera- 
tive; there is certainly every reason to believe that the influx of intel- 
ligent Germans into this country after the political disturbances in 
Europe in 1848 had much to do with the general interest in physical 
training that was so plainly apparent five or six years afterwards. 
The limitations of this paper and the extent of the movement make it 
impossible to mention even briefly all the important steps that were 
taken toward the rehabilitation of gymnastics during that period. The 
work done in the colleges was particularly valuable, but it need not 
occupy attention at present, both because this investigation relates 
niore particularly to the common schools, and because this Bureau has

already issued a publication in which that phase of the subject received 
thorough and satisfactory treatment.! 
Miss Catherine E. Beecher, who has already been mentioned as an 
ardent and consistent advocate of calisthenics for females, again came 
into public notice in 1856 through a book called A Manual of Physi- 
ology and Calisthenics for Schools and Families. N. W.'T. Root’s School 
Amusements, embracing, among many other things, ‘simple rules for 
military and gymnastic exercises,” appeared in 1857. These two books, 
the former in advocacy of light movements, and the latter setting forth 
a series of exercises for the usual German apparatus such as bars, lad- 
ders, etc., had a rather extensive circulation and. contributed materially 
to the stock of practical knowledge upon gymnastics. In 1859, Dr. G. 
B. Winship, of Boston, appeared in advocacy of heavy lifting as a 
means of physical training, and his lectures and exhibitions excited 
wide interest. 
DIV LEWIS, AND THE “NEW GYMNASTICS.” 
The climax of the gymnastic movement of the antebellum period was 
reached when there appeared on the scene the most picturesque figure 
in the history of American physical training, Dio - Lewis. This 
man had been a public lecturer upon physiology and temperance, and 
possessed in a remarkable degree the power of arousing popular atten- 
tion and even enthusiasm. He himself, as one of his pupils said, was 
a “perfect perambulating galvanic battery of energy and enthusiasm.” 
The beginning of his connection with gymnastics may be told in his 
own words: 
Educated to the profession of medicine, and mingling for many years principally 
with those classes who suffer most from nonobservance of the laws of health, I came 
many years ago to think somewhat seriously of that ounce of prevention which is 
worth tons of cure. Want of muscular exercise was one of the most obvious defects 
in our physical life. It was notless obvious thatthe yery structure of town and city 
society rendered the correction of the evil impracticable, except in the gymnasium. 
I examined the German gymnasium, the one so much in vogue throughout the United 
States, with great care. Entering one of these institutions as a pupil, I studied the 
anatomical and physiological bearings of its many exercises. I found that they were 
not well adapted to children, women, fat men, or old men, and about eight years 
ago [i. e., about 1853] I began the attempt to devise something better. During this 
time I have invented more than 500 different-exercises, of which a large experience 
has fully indorsed nearly 300.    
  The leading feature of his system [according-to the New York Tribune of August 
27, 1860] is to use such exercises as will produce hearty merriment, and cause those 
engaged to enter into them with enthusiasm and great delight. It employs a great 
variety of positions of the limbs and body, and rapid changes, reminding one of the 
prompt, rapid, and varied movements of the Chicago Zouaves. His apparatusis of 
the simplest construction and of trifling expense, and may be easily prepared by 
any person, and at the same time is adapted for use in any schoolroom or school

yard, and also for the family. He uses wooden dumb-bells weighing not over a pound 
each, and clubs varying from two to three or four pounds each; air guns, bags of 
beans weighing from two to three pounds, rubber balls, bows and arrows, chess- 
ball game, ete. In all these there is great amusement, so that all the benefits of 
exercise are most admirably combined, and to'one who has witnessed them it seems 
almost incredible that so much‘can be accomplished in so cheap and simple a man- 
ner. *~ * * Another exercise consisted in the use of sticks, about the size of a 
broom-handle and the length ofacane. * * * Inusing these sticks, movements 
of the arms, shoulders, and chest were accomplished. Then followed the calisthenic 
movements df head, neck, and shoulders. 
Dr. Lewis did not confine himself to exercises of his own. invention, 
but freely and openly borrowed from every system and every author 
whose exercises could be profitably incorporated with his own system. 
Miss Beecher’s calisthenics he used from the first; he instituted the 
“Swedish movement cure” as a department of his gymnasium reprinted 
the free exercises: of Moritz Schreber, of the Leipzig Orthopedic and 
Medico-Gymnastic Institute; translated the Dumb-bell Instructor of 
Maurice Kloss, of the Royal Saxon Normal Gymnastic Institute at 
Dresden, and republished in’ English Dr. Shreber’s work on the Pan- 
gymuastikon. : : 
It appears that the first practical application of Dr. Lewis’s “new 
gymnastics,” as he called it, was in Mr. N. T. Allen’s school in West 
Newton, Mass., in 1860, though the statement is also made that the Nor- 
mal School at Framingham was the first in which these exercises were 
regularly introduced under the personal direction of Dr. Lewis himself. 
During the same year he opened a gymnasium in Boston, making the 
third in the city. About the same time, i. e., in August, 1860, the 
American Institute of Instruction, then the leading pedagogical organi- 
zation in the country, held its meeting in Boston. In some way Dr. 
Lewis attracted the attention of the managers of the meeting, and was 
invited to appear before it and “explain and illustrate his new system.” 
He did so, and such was the impression he made that at the end of the 
half-hour allotted him his time was extended and he occupied tivo hours 
of the time of the meeting. The next morning he was accorded nearly 
two hours more, and at noon still another hour. His fame was then 
assured. The institute unanimously passed commendatory resolutions’ 
regarding his system; the newspapers generally published accounts 
more or less full of it, and it sprang into instant popularity. Mr. D. B. 
Hagar, the president of the American Institute, declared “the way so 
long desired has been pointed out,” and John D. Philbrick, the super- 
intendent of the Boston public schools, afterward said: 
_How can we introduce physical exercises into our schools was an unsolved 
problem in my mind for many years. The old system of gymnastics, with its bars 
and swings and ladders, was quite impossible in a great system of public schools, 
but when I saw that these exercises of the new system might be performed even in 
a school room, in the midst of the desks and chairs without difficulty or danger, I 
felt the problem was solved. We shall have them in all our schools. It is only a 
question of time.
-P-A-G-E-545
    
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 517 
After Dr. Lewis’s success before the American Institute he was in 
great demand as a lecturer upon gymnastics and as a writer for maga- 
zines and various educational publications. He himselt established a 
monthly periodical called Lewis’s New Gymastics for Ladies, Gentle- — 
men and Children, and Boston Journal of Physical Culture, which lived 
through two years. His apparatus was in demand far and wide, and 
schools in all parts of the country began the use of his exercises. Hay-° 
ing experienced great annoyance because of incompetent persons who 
assumed to teach his system, he resolved upon the establishment of a 
normal school in connection with his gymnasium.’ This was opened in 
1861, the lecturers being Dr. T. H. Hoskins, anatomy; Dr. Josiah Cur- 
tis, physiology, and Dr. Walter Channing, sr., hygiene, in addition to 
Dr. Lewis, who appeared as “professor of gymnastics.” 
The course of study prescribed covered ten weeks, and at the end of 
that time the pupils were graduated as competent teachers of gymnas- 
tics. They “had a very good time, but accomplished comparatively 
little in the direction of physical training, and received no instruction 
at all in the meaning and value of gymnastic exercises.”! But, bearing 
the stamp of the master’s approval, they readily found employment and 
were regarded as true representatives of scientific gymnastics. 
But even such drawbacks as poorly prepared, though certificated, 
teacliers might not have been fatal had not the excitement of the civil 
war and the newly-born enthusiasm for military drill, cadet corps, rifle’ 
practice, and target-shooting completely upset the calculations of those 
who labored in behalf of gymnastics. Thenceforward calisthenics and 
bean bags were relegated to the background and military marching and 
tactics were pursued to arouse or restore the military aptitude and spirit 
of the American people. Military institutes were established through- 
out the country; high schools made military drill a regular feature; 
pupils of grammar schools organized themselves into military compa- 
nies, and the National Government endowed colleges, one of whose ~ 
main purposes was instruction in military tactics. Everywhere the 
military spirit prevailed and gymnastics suffered. / 
Dr. Lewis did not long continue tis gymnastic labors. He established 
a school in Lexington, Mass., in 1864, which was burned in 1868. A 
year later he finally gave up the work and until his death confined his’ 
attention to lectures upon hygiene and temperance. : 
' There appears to be a disposition of late years to belittle Dio Lewis 
and his work. This is unfortunate, to say the least. It may be true 
' that “he was unconventional, sympathetic, plausible, oracular, and » 
self sufficient,” and ‘not a scientist in any proper sense,” as one writer 
has said. But, notwithstanding all this, he rendered a real service. 
Even if he had nothing in his favor but the undoubted fact that he 
gave gymnastics in America a greater impulse than any man before 
~1'Phe words are those of Dr. Walter Channing, jr., who had been a pupil of the 
school.

him had done, that would be sufficient to earn for him the gratitude of 
all.interested in physical training. But he did more. He first awak- 
ened the American public to an appreciation of the fact that the mere 
development of huge muscles is not the true idea of physical training. 
His contribution to the list of exercises and to gymnastic material was 
by no means insignificant, though, to be sure, his claims were out of 
all proportion to their value; but, more than all else, he lifted the gym- 
nasium above the low plane it had occupied in the public mind as the 
resort. of prize-fighters and bullies, and carried gymuastics into the 
schoolroom to an extent néver before approached in this country, and into 
the home to an extent that no one else had eyer attempted. 
THE RECENT REVIVAL OF GYMNASTICS. 
After the close of the war the ardor for military exercises naturally 
declined very perceptibly. Then, since the military exercises had in a 
great measure supplanted those of the gymnasium, there came a period 
of comparative quiet in both these lines of physical training. This did 
-not follow immediately after the cessation of hostilities, for such a 
movement once under headway rarely collapses suddenly; but before 
ten years had passed popular interest was at a low ebb; then, after a 
time, it began to rise slowly and-gradually, but surely. 
‘To assign as the cause for this any one event, or series of events, 
would beerroneous. Public sentiment was ripe for a gymnastic revival, 
and it came. 
But it is interesting to note some of its important incidents. 
Popular interest in out door sports of all kinds has steadily grown 
since the war, and to the value of gymnastics as a preparation for ath- 
letic games may be ascribed in a great measure the activity in gymna- 
sium building which has marked the last fifteen years. The erection 
of the Hemenway gymnasium for Harvard University at Cambridge, 
Mass., in 1879 and.the effective work of Dr, D. A. Sargent, its director, 
~ has also done much to stimulate effort elsewhere in the same line.' 
Among our German population the love of gymnastics is perennial. As 
the German influence was strong in the gymnastic movement of the 
fifties, so, too, it has made itself felt in the recent events and discussions. 
As far back as 1876 the standing committee on music, drawing, and calis- 
thenics’ of the school board of Milwaukee, Wis., adverted to the imper- 
fection of the school system so long as calisthenics was not regularly 
taught. They recommended “ that a sum be included in this year’s 
budget large enough to engage a teacher to take charge of this branch 
of instruction, especially as Milwaukee has in its midst a man who, if 
his services can be secured, would soon bring it to a perfection not 
equaled in any of the schools of this country.” This man was Mr.

George Brosius, already famous as a leader in the Turnerbund, and 
subsequently the head of its normal school for teachers of gymnastics. 
The members of this committee for 1877 were Messrs. J. A. Becher, 
F. Schloemilch, W. Schmidt, Jacob Freytag, and J. L. Schmidt. It 
would have been remarkable if a committee so constituted had not 
secured the appointment of Mr. Brosius. But they did, and they also 
accomplished the passage-of rules which placed the subject apparently 
upona firm basis; namely, providing for teachers’ ineetings for instruc- 
tion from the special teacher, requiring definite and fixed times for calis- 
thenics daily, and making such a division of his time as to allow the 
specialist to visit all classes. The use of the word “ calisthenics” in the 
above connection bears no relation to the “calisthenics” advocated by 
Miss Beecher, for Mr. Brosius’s exercises were plainly those of the 
German system. The results of his teaching were such as might have 
been expected from such a man, distinctly beneficial, and the example 
of Milwaukee was followed by other cities in thatsection. Mr. Brosius 
severed his connection with the public schools in 1881, and assumed — 
the control of the gymnastic seminary of the North American Turner- 
bund. His place was not filled, but physical exercises were still required’ 
by the school regulations. 
One of the most important centers of the gynmastic propaganda, so 
far as relates to public schools, for the last ten years has been Kansas 
City, Mo. The teaching of gymnastics was begun there in a modest 
way in October, 1885, and Mr. Carl-Betz was employed with the title 
of “instructor of calisthenics.”! 
It is needless to say that Mr. Betz is an exponent of the German 
gymnastics, having graduated from the Turners’ Gymnastic Seminary. 
Since the beginning of the work whatever opposition there was to it 
has been almost entirely overcome. Mr. Betz now bears the title of 
“superintendent of physical culture,” and his exercises, so far from 
being confined to “ calisthenics,” embrace, as he says, eight distinct 
branches of gymnastics, forming together, when fully developed, a 
complete system of educational gymnastics meeting all the requirements 
of modern physical education.’ 
Mr. Betz has written several manuals of gymnastics, and he has the 
satisfaction of knowing that they, with the example of his practical 
work in Kansas City, have materially aided in benemg about the intro- 
As in the previous case, the use of the word ‘“ soitnenies ” was due to a cunfound- 
ing of free gymnastics with the languid movements for females so common in this: 
country a generation ago. That term, by the way, is still frequently applied to free 
or light gymnastics, especially by the German-Americans. 
*They are: (1) Free gymnastics, including breathing; (2) light gymnastics, com- 
prising poles, dumbbells, rings, wandsj’ and Indian clubs; (3) tactics, marching 
and marching evolutions; (4) popular gymnastics, comprising athletics and the 
gymnastic plays of the playground; (5) heavy gymnastics, exercises on stationary 
apparatus; (6) gymnastic plays and games; (7) fancy gymnastics, gymnastic com- 
position; (8) outing

duction of physical training in a large number of American commu: 
nities. 
Among other cities that began the work of systematic physical 
training early in the history of the recent movement were Omaha, 
Nebr., in 1885; Chicago, Il.,in 1886; Davenport, Iowa, and St. Joseph, 
Mo., in 1887; Canton, Ohio, and Holyoke and Lowell, Mass., in 1888, 
~ and Denver, Colo., and Washington, D. ©., in 1889, 
The German system is employed in all these cities, excepting Lowell 
and Washington, in which eclectic systems are used. 
The American Association for the Advancement of Physical Eduea- 
tion, which was organized in Brooklyn, N. Y., November 27, 1885, must 
be peoaciled a prominent place among the agencies for ee the 
work of the last few years. To Dr. W. G. Anderson, then of Adelphi 
Academy, Brooklyn, the most of the credit is due for the organization 
of this association, for it was in response to his invitation that about 
60 “representatives of various educational institutions and friends of 
physical culture” assembled for the purpose of permanent organiza- 
tion. The original officers were: President, Prof. Edward Hitchcock, 
M. D.; vice-presidents, Rev. Edward P. Phe PH. D.; D. A. Sar- 
gent, M. D.; Miss H.C. Putnam; secretary, William G. Anderson, M. 
D.; treasurer, Prof. J. D. Andrews; council (in addition to the forego- 
ing officers), Prof. H. J. Koehler, Charles McIntire, jr., M. p., William 
Blaikie, esq. The association meets annually; its membership embraces 
representatives of every school of gymnastics, and its discussions 
cover every phase of physical training. If that great desideratum; an 
American system of physical training, is ever evolved its development 
will be the result of such deliberations ,as are to be heard in these 
meetings.! 
After the meetings ot the American Association for the Advancement 
of Physical Education, which deserve the first place on account of their 
Remy, the next moe epee en Samer has been what is known

as the “Physical Training Conference,” held in Boston, Mass,, Novem- 
ber 29 and 30, 1889, ‘ 
This meeting was one of the most significant events of late years, 32 
numbering among its participants not only most of the leading lights 
in the gymnastic world, but also many of the most prominent figures 
in American education. Its object was ‘to place before educators 
different systems of gymnastics, and to secure discussion of the same, 
with a view to clearly ascertaining the needs of the schools and deter- 
mining how they may best be met.” 
It was made possible by the liberality of Mrs. Mary Hemenway, of 
Boston, whose interest in physical training had already been shown by 
establishing the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics and in otherwise 
aiding in the spread of gymnastics. There can be no doubt that the 
resolution of thanks passed at the close of the meeting expressed the 
truth in saying that “the whole cause of physical education in America 
has received a great impetus” from the meeting. It marked an epoch 
in physical training. é R 
On June 24, 1890, the Boston school committee ordered the introdue- 
tion of the Swedish system of gymnastics in all the public schools of the 
city, and the first day of tue next year Dr. E. M. Hartwell entered 
upon his duties as director of physical training in furtherance of ‘that 
order. A number of cities, especially in the East, have followed the 
example of Boston in the introduction of the Swedish system, and the = 
Germans have been stimulated by the sudden popularity of the Ling’ 
-gymnastics to redouble their efforts in behalf of theirown system. Up 
to this time the rivalry between the two systems has been beneficial, 
because it has brought gymnastics more prominently before the educa- 
tional public than ever before; but there is danger that their continued 
sharp competition for public favor will prove injurious to the cause that 
both serve. The battle for gymnastics is hard to.fight at best, but how 
much harder would it be with its forces divided by internal dissension, 
and that, too, caused largely by the national feeling of rival peoples, 
both of which are alien to our soil. 
With what confidence can an American board of education adopt 
the one.system of gymnastics when a large and able body of experts 
pronounce it “ without rational or physiological foundation,” and with 
what trepidation will they approach the other system when an even 
larger number of equally able men assert, with their greatest physi- 
ologist, that ‘‘only the half-educated are impressed by it?” And what 
comfort can they gain by turning the eclectic systems when both parties 
sneer at them as “heterogeneous conglomerations ?” 
                
         THE PRESENT STATUS OF PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
   The present status of physical training in the city public schools is 
best disclosed by an examination of the statistical tables appended. 
They are self-explanatory, and no remarks are needed in this connec

tion further than to call attention to the fact that they embrace three 
categories, namely: (1) Those cities which profess to have introduced 
a regular system of gymnastics and have-placed the same under the 
eare of a specialist; (2) cities which employ no specialist, but which 
require regular instruction by class teachers, and (3) cities in which 
physical exercises are practiced at the discretion of the teachers, but 
without the supervision of a special teacher and without an effective 
compulsory regulation. 
It is plain that in the cities as a whole, gymnastics is still in 1 the 
stage of experiment and inquiry.’ In a few cities conspicuous and 
permanent success seems to have been attained, but whether this has 
been due to the personal efforts and influence of exceptionally efficient 
directors backed by exceptionally earnest and intelligent school boards, 
remains to be seen after the lapse of years has brought the usual changes 
in personnel and policies. 
It is not necessary to dwell upon the status of gymnastics in the 
country at large. ‘The conditions are well known to all who will be 
likely to read this article; but it is well to recall the extensive and im- 
portant work and influence in this line of the college gymnasiums and 
inter-collegiate athletic events; the athletic clubs, some of them of im- 
posing dimensions, that exist in nearly all of our cities; the physical 
culture departments of the Young Men’s Christian Association and 
similar organizations; and the North American Turnerbund, with its 
branches in almost every community that contains even a small pro-— 
portion of Germans, giving instruction to boys and girls as well as to 
~ adults. 
The number of normal schools, normal classes, and summer schools 
for teachers of gymnastics is considerable. The Normal School of the 
North American Turnerbund, established in 1868, and now located at 
Milwaukee, Wis., under the direction of Mr. George Brosius, is the 
fountain head from which issues the stream of teachers of the German 
system; while the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics, established in 
1889 by Mrs. Mary Hemenway, with Miss Amy Morris Homans as 
director, annually graduates a large class of teachers of the Swedish

school at Springfield, Mass., under Dr. Luther Gulick for training the 
directors of its several gymnasiums, and Dr. W. G. Anderson is the 
president of a normal school at New Haven, Conn., which he has 
recently removed from Brooklyn, N. Y. In addition to these four 
prominent and regularly organized institutions there are a number of

Of the summer schools, the most widely known are that of Dr. D. A. 
Sargent at Cambridge, Mass., and that of Dr. W. G. Anderson, at 
Chatauqua, N. Y. 
CONCLUSION. 
A study of the history of physical culture in this country shows very 
clearly that the American people have never been unmindful of the 
demands of the body. One form of training after another has been 
pursued and tested until it has developed elements which have failed 
to harmonize with American ideas, and then it has been abandoned ~ 
and another-taken up. The interval between has always been short, 
only sufficient for the effects of the lack to beapparent. Then the popu- 
lar mind has turned to physical exercise again and the popular ear has 
been attentive to the claims of any new comer who has been able to 
-advance reasonable arguments in favor of hisideas. Furthermore, each 
wave of popular interest which the history of physical training discloses 
has left its impress upon the general character of physical training as 
it is to-day, and has contributed to make what will be at some future” 
time “the American system of physical training.” Such a consumma- 
tion has not yet been reached, or the “ German system,” the “Swedish 
system,” and the “Delsarte system” would not enjoy such high favor; 
but there can be no doubt that in its final development the “‘ American 
system” will be a composite, not of these three, as the “‘ combination 
systems” of to-day generally claim to be, but of all combined American 
experience in the field of physical training. The progress of the evolu- 
tion toward an American system even in the last few years, may be 
. distinctly seen, especially in school gymnastics; for, have not the Ger- — 
mans begun to.adopt the Swedish ideas of the day’s orders and syste- 
matic progression, and have not the Swedes aimed to make their gym- 
nastics more attractive, even going so farin one case as to use the Ger- 
man bars, and in another to advocate the use of a combination of systems 
for older pupils; and have not the professed followers of Delsarte adopted 
exercises that are plainly muscle makers as well grace givers? And do 
not they all utilize much that comes from the old English sports, from 
calisthenics, from Dio Lewis, and from Dr. Sargent? And is not all 
this found side by side and in harmony with military institutes after 
the plan of Col. Partridge, manual labor and manual training schools 
after the manner of Dr. Cornelius, and military drill in high schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-552

after the war-time ideas? And finally, there is reason to believe that 
until this composition of forces, this amalgamation of systems, does 
take place, so that a well defined and well established American Sys, 
tem is produced, physical training will never rest upon a safe basis in - 
this country. 
All the history of the subject shows that the conflict of systems and 
methods, not popular indifference, has been, next to the inefficiency of 
teachers, the most dangerous enemy with which physical training has 
had to contend. 
HISTORY oF GYMNASTICS IN THREE TYPICAL AMERICAN CITY 
ScHOOL SYSTEMS. 
I. ST. LOUIS, MO. 
St. Louis was one of the first cities in the country in which physical 
training was actually and practically applied in the public schools. 
In 1855 Mr. John H. Tice, then superintendent, recommended that 
“provisions be made at our schools for gymnastic and calisthenic exer- 
cises during the recess hours; apparatus for which I consider as neces- 
sary fixtures, and indispensable to a perfect system of education.” Mr. 
Ira Divoll, Mr. Tice’s successor, was also favorably disposed toward 
gymnastics, and his report for 185758 urges the purchase for each play 
ground of “a few simple and inexpensive contrivances for gymnastic 
exercise, Such as a revolving swing, and inclined ladder, horizontal 
bars, and wooden horses, a perpendicular climbing pole, and swinging 
rings.” Some of the schools were, in fact, soon afterward supplied with 
nearly all of these machines. He also describes what he calls “ manual 
exercises,” that were practiced in many of the primary schools. ‘It is 
pleasant,” he says, ‘‘to see 200 children, all in perfect order, go through 
with these changes and evolutions, and to witness in their faces the 
pleasure and happiness they derive from the exercises. All admit that 
these occasional relaxations from study and recitation are both health- 
ful and profitable.” In the next year, 1858-59, we are told that ‘“exer- 
cises in the manual drill and instruction in physical education received 
considerable attention,” and in the same year the first special teacher 
of physical education was empioyed for the St. Louis schools in the 
person of Capt. Hartnett Hammersley. The story of his connection 
with the schools is thus told by Mr. ©. S. Pennell in his report as prin- 
cipal of the high school:    
A few weeks before the close of the year Capt. Hammersley offered to come to the 
schoolhouse daily to direct a class in orthosomic and hygienic exercises, the object 
of the exercises being, as the names indicate, to improve the form and carriage of the 
body and the health. A class of about 20 girls was, by the permission of the 
high school committee, placed under his direction. ‘The exercises proved pleasant 
to the pupils, and though the time was so short that no considerable results could 
be expected, yet visitors were interested and generally satisfied that the exercises 
were well adapted to secure the objects intended. ~ ~*~ Capt. Hammersley 
\

     PHYSICAL TRAINING. 525 
believes that, by actual measurement, at intervals of a few months he can show 
improvement in the capacity of the chest and in the size of the most important vital 
organs. 
The next year Capt. Hammersley received a salary of $500 for his ~ 
services in the high and normal schools for three days in each week. 
In the lower grades daily lessons were given in the ‘ positions” and 
“manual drill” during the same year: The special instructor continued 
in service for only a year, but the free. exercises in the lower grades 
have continued in different forms and with varying degrees of effect- 
iveness ever since. : 
The Dio Lewis gymnastics was introduced in the St. Louis schools 
by Mr. Ebenezer Knowlton, who succeeded Mr. Pennell as principal of 
the high school in 1862, Mr. Knowlton had just graduated from Dio 
Lewis’s Normal School, and was an enthusiast for the “new gymnas- 
tics.” Military drill was also employed in the high school during the 
war period to secure “unity and promptness of action, and erectnéss 
and grace of carriage.” 
After the war but little seems to have been done for physical train- 
ing. Calisthenics was practiced by some of the teachers, but there was 
no specialist in charge, and no rule requiring the exercises. 
It was not until 1890 that anything really effective according to pres- 
ent day standards was done. At the meeting of the board of educa- 
tion on January 14 of that year Mr. Richard Bartholdt introduced 
a resolution directing the committee on course of study to'prepare a 
plan for-the introduction of physical training in the public schools of 
St. Louis. The resolution was referred to the committee on course of 
study, who held a meeting on February 6 to which a number of the 
officers and teachers of the German turner societies were invited. As 
aresult a communication was presented to the full board on February 
11 in which the seven teachers of German gymnastics in the city pro- 
posed to’ give instruction gratis in free gymnastics in seven public 
schools of the city for the remainder of the school year as an experi- 
ment. The only stipulation was that the gymnastic exercises were tobe 
considered a regular branch of study for those schools during the con- 
tinuance of the experiment. 
‘The offer was at once accepted, and the teachers entered upon their 
work. In the following July Mr. Bartholdt offered another resolution 
at the board meeting, declaring that the instruction given had proved 
a great success, and that the principals of the schools recommended its 
continuance. It therefore directed the introduction of physical train- 
ing as a regular branch of instruction. This resolution was referred 
to the appropriate committee, and at the next meeting its author con- 
tinued his effort by presenting petitions signed by 14,500 citizens, ask- 
ing the introduction of gymnastics as contemplated by the resolution. 
A report was made in October by the committee to which the matter 
was referred, and on November 11 it was decided by the board to

employ eight teachers of physical culture, and that the system which 
had been successfully tried in the previous spring be regularly installed 
in the schools. Mr. George Wittich was designated during the follow- 
ing year as “general supervisor of ealisthenic instruction,” a position- 
he still holds, 
II. CINCINNATI, OHIO. 
In Cincinnati, too, the gymnastic ardor began early. Supt. A. J. 
Rickoff stated in 1857 that “ the enterprise and liberality of individual 
trustees had resulted in the placing of a few parallel bars, horizontal 
ladders, and cireular swings upon the play grounds of four of the 
schoolhouses.” 
He proposed that “provision be made at once for instructing all the 
teachers now employed in the schools in such a system of gymnastics 
as shall be adapted to the several grades of the schools from the sixth 
to the first. That the system proceed from the simplest. movement to 
the most complex and difficult exercises. We have now all the appli- 
ances necessary. Free gymnastics—that is, gymnastics without appa- 
ratus—will, in the various forms practiced, afford a variety for culti- 
vating strength and grace altogether sufficient, if we will only consent 
to devote the necessary time tothem. * * * Gymnastics and calis- 
thenics, in all schools of the sixth. grade, ought to occupy not less 
than half an hour in the morning and afternoon, each five minutes 
between each recitation, making together an hour per day. * * * 
The pupils of the fifth grade ought to have scarcely less. The third 
and fourth grades should each spend not less than fifteen minutes in 
exercise morning and afternoon. In the intermediate schools, five 
minutes should be devoted to rapid, vigorous exercise, at the ringing 
of each bell for change of classes.” In these recommendations Mr. 
Rickoff followed in the footsteps of Dr. Ryerson, the free gymnastics 
introduced by the latter having attracted Mr. Rickotf’s notice during 
a visit to the normal school at Toronto. 
In the next year the board of education ordered frequent recesses in 
the lower grades “for the better guarding of the health of the pupils,” 
and in 1859 ecalisthenic exercise for five minutes at the end of each 
recitation was made obligatory for the pupils of grade D, a require- 
ment that was subsequently extended to the three lowest grades. 
In 1861 gymnastics was introduced as a regular exercise under the 
direction of instructors specially employed for that purpose. The 
immediate cause of this move appears to have been the report of the~ 
special committee of the Boston school committee which had been 
appointed to consider the recommendations of Supt. Philbrick.! This 
report was directly in the line of the previous experience of the Cin- 
cinnati officials, and its recommendations were at once adopted, with 
minor alterations, the most important of which was that the time given

  PHYSICAL TRATNING. 527 
to gymnastics was made fifteen minutes daily, or half as much as the 
Boston plan contemplated. It was stated by the president of the 
board of education in 1862, Mr. Rufus: King, that— 
For years we have attested our sense of the necessity of making the physical as- 
well as intellectual and moral training of the youth of both sexes.a part of the 
regular course of school exercises, * * * Forsome time active encouragement 
was given to the use of every description of gymnastic apparatus. 
It was soon found that the teniptations to excess resulted in frequent injuries. 
We have, therefore, resorted to a simpler method, taught by an accomplished and 
careful teacher in all our schools, which dispenses almost entirely with apparatus, 
and by gentler and more natural exercises of the body and limbs, and with but 
trifling cost, give development and symmetry to the whole frame. For boys it 
includes some of the elementary exercises of the soldier, and thus proves not only 
very attractive, but tends in no small degree to infuse them with correct ideas of 
order and discipline. 
Mr. Louis Graeser was the teacher employed, and his connection 
with the Cincinnati schools in the capacity of instructor of gymnastics 
coutinued until 1873. For a great part of that time he was provided 
with a female assistant, who supervised the exercises of the primary 
schools. His salary was $1,000 per annum at the beginning of his 
employment, but was gradually raised to $1,800. 
The rules promulgated by the board of education during this period 
required each teacher to give a lesson in gymnastics of not less than five 
nor more than ten minutes during each session. The regular teacher 
was to be present and assist the special teacher in his instruetion. 
Rings and dumb-bells were to be used in the intermediate schools and 
the highest grade of the district schools. A pupil might be excused 
from the gymnastic exercises only upon presentation of a physician’s 
certificate that the pupil was suffering from.disease or some physical 
defect. The first of these rules was passed in 1863 and others were> 
added from time to time. They continued in force until 1881, though 
there had been no special instructor since Mr. Graeser. 
How gymnastics gradually dropped out of the schools may be appre- 
ciated by noting the changes in the committees of the board which had 
control of physical training. From 1861 to 1865 there was a standing 
“committee on gymnastics,” consisting of 5 members; in 1865 this 
number was reduced to 3; in 1878 the “committee on gyntnastics” was 
abolished, and instead there was substituted the “committee on. 
hygiene” of 5 members, to have “supervision of ventilation, light, gym- 
nastics, and everything which pertains to the health of the pupils;” 
in 1881 the committee on hygiene disappeared, and its place was taken 
by the “committee on boundaries, statistics, and hygiene” of 3 mem- 
bers, whose duties were indicated by the name. ‘Under the head of 
hygiene they had “supervision of ventilation, light, and everything 
which appertains to the health of the pupils.” Gymnastics had gone 
into history. 
The effects of the recent discussions throughout the country have been 
felt in Cincinnati as well as elsewhere, and from the last report of the

superintendent (i. e., for 189091, published in 1892) we learn that 
“justructions have been given, and oft repeated, to teachers te be con- 
stant and faithful in the matter of free gymnastics or calisthenics in the 
schoolrooms. * * * Exercises of this nature are given twice daily, 
and in some cases oftener, with as free a circulation of air as possible.” 
Plans have been made for suitable buildings for gymnasiums upon the 
grounds of the high schools.! : 
Ill, BOSTON, MASS. 
Boston has always been among the first in the discussion if not the 
adoption of new ideas in education, and one naturally turns to that 
city in search for light upon almost any subject within the domain of 
educational thought. This is especially true in the matter of physical 
training, as the foregoing pages have already clearly shown. In the 
present instance we are further aided by the habit of the Boston 
school authorities of reducing to print nearly every important paper 
-connected with the conduct of the schools. ‘The several reports of 
special committees on physicial training, and especially the first report 
of Dr. E. M. Hartwell as director of physical training, published in 1891, 
have made the course of physical training in Boston as easy to follow 
as the king’s highway. . 
After the passage of the rule by the Boston school committee in 1853,” 
which enjoined ‘that every scholar should have daily some kind of 
physical or gymnastic exercise,” there was a long silence which will 
bear no construction favorable to a supposition of effective practice of 
gymnastics. The next significant utterance upon the subject appears 
in the sixth quarterly report of Supt. John D. Philbrick, dated Sep- 
tember 7,.1858, Mr. Philbrick- had just returned from a visit to the 
schools of New York City; and one of their features that struck him most 
. favorably was the management of the recesses there. “The pupils while 
in the yard or playground,” he said, “ were always under the inspection 
of one or more teachers, detailed for that service. Some of the build- 
ings are furnished with excellent gymnastic apparatus, and in some 
schools calisthenic exercises were practiced to good advantage.”* 
  
1See foot note on page 522 for new State law requiring physical culture in all large 
cities in Ohio. 
*See page 514. ~ 
‘The credit for this belongs largely to Mr. 8. W. Seton, then one of the assistant 
superintendents of the New York schools, whose activity had brought about the 
practice of calisthenics in a great many of the schools. In 1857 he urged the adop- 
tion of a regular system of exercises and the appointment of a professor to instruct 
the teachers in it. In his report for that year he gave several pages to the subject, 
and presented a number of exercises for the schoolroom, which he recommended as 
tending to ‘‘expand the chest, lengthen the collar bone, and strengthen the spinal 
column and the muscles of the back, and serve to give an erect, graceful, and health- 
ful form to the body.” So great was his interest in the matter that he brought and 
distributed among the principals a number of copies of Miss Beecher’s book on Phys- 
iology and Calisthenics, and even arranged with Miss Beecher to meet the principals 
and give them practical lessons in her movements.

Five features of the New York schools were considered by him to be 
worthy of adoption in Boston, and this was one of them. One of Mr. 
Philbrick’s chief characteristics was his readiness in grasping a good 
idea wherever he saw it and in applying it in his own work. His very 
next quarterly report contained the following: 
But it [the public school system] issusceptible of much higher excellence than has 
yet been reached. The first step was necessarily intellectual education; physical 
will come next, and then moral. This is the historical order of development in sys-_ 
tems and nations. We have educated the intellect, but now it is seen that body 
with mind is necessary to produce high ability. Then it will appear that ability 
will not produce happiness and enable the possessor to fulfill the ends of his being, 
unless governed by moral sentiments; and the development of these requires moral 
education. * * * Whilethe intellect is intraining the conscience anc the body must 
notbeneglected. * * * TIwould have theteacher aim to make every exercise con- 
tribute as far as practicable to moral and physical improvement. Still, the school is 
not achureh, nor a gymnasium; if it were, it would not bea school. * * * Liberal 
play grounds ought to be provided for every school, at whatever cost, and they 
should be used. 
Mr. Philbrick did not follow up the matter in his next reports, but 
being impressed with Dio Lewis’s exhibition before the American insti- 
itute of instruction,' he reverted to the idea of adopting light gymnas- 
tics for the Boston schools. In his next official report, made in Sep- 
tember, 1860, he suggested the “introduction into all grades of our 
schools of athorough system of physical training, as a part of school cul- 
ture,” and added that for this purpose, ‘it might be necessary to employ 
for atime or, perhaps, permanently one accomplished teacher in this 
department of education,” his idea being that the successful introduc- 
tion of a system of physical exercises would require the services of a 
special instructor to aid and instruct the teachers, and to see that the 
exercises were judicious and proper in themselves and well performed. 
These suggestions were referred to a special committee, who reported 
in December, recommending “the appointment of a teacher of gymnas- 
tics, and of a committee on physical training and the passage of an 
order that ‘the teachers in all the public schools be required to devote a 
part of each school session to physical exercises, not exceeding half an 
hour and not less than a quarter of an hour,’” 
The recommendations were discussed in the full board, but without 
result, the objections to the recommendations being that they contem- 
plated the creation of a new committee and the employment of an addi- 
tional teacher; and it was feared that the proposed plan would add to 
the pupils’ tasks instead of relieving them. It was also urged that the 
desired end could be gained by a general observance of the rule of 1853, 
still in force, which provided that “‘every scholar should have daily in 
the forenoon and afternoon, some kind of physical or gymnastic exer- 
cise.” e 
Notwithstanding the failure of the school committee to adopt the plan 
suggested, Dio Lewis and his influence were abroad in the land, and

in several of the schools there was energetic and fairly efiicient prac- 
tice of gymnastics. Inthe high school for boys, “one of the ushers, by 
the help of a simple ladder, Indian clubs, and dumb bells, had made 
considerable progress in giving flexibility to the limbs and develop- 
ment to the muscles of the members of his class.” 
In the Eliot School Mr. 8S. W. Mason, then its master, had already 
begun to practice the exercises which later attracted wide attention and 
led to the publication of his “ Manual of Gymnastic Exercises.” This 
little book ran through several editions, and has been of great value, 
especially in the Boston schools. In the Dwight, Mayhew, and Han- 
cock schools there was also a reasonably full compliance with the rules 
then in force. 
Mr. Philbrick and his supporters in the school committee did not relax 
their efforts, and though they did not aceomplish the complete intro- 
duction of gymnastics they did succeed in constantly extending the 
number of schools in which physical exercises were regularly practiced. 
Tn 1862, no less than “70 teachers of the primary schools had received 
special training and instruction in physical exercises with a view to 
conduct that branch in the schools under their own charge.” During 
the same year the superintendent also states that ‘marked progress 
has been made in physical training and in a few it has been carried to 
a high degree of excellence.” “Gratifying progress” is reported the 
next year also. 
But in the meantime the military spirit began to rise. The matter 
of “military gymnastics and drill” having been previously discussed in 
the public print, was first brought to the notice of the board in “a 
petition signed by Edward Everett, C. G. Loring, J. M. Beebe, and 
others, citizens of Boston, interested in the preservation of public order 
and the protection of property,” praying that instruction might be 
forthwith introduced into the public schools for boys. At the same 
time a supplementary petition was presented, numerously signed, which 
urged the advantages of military drill as the best means of physical 
training as well as the proper preparation for the Army. These peti- 
tions were presented to the school board November 3, 1863, and were 
immediately referred to a special committee. The committee reported 
December 8, unanimously favoring the plan “both as a means of 
physical training, and ultimately of national defense.” They recom- 
mended that it be tried as an experiment in the two high schools and two 
grammar schools, and that a suitable instructor in military gymnasties 
and drill be employed. This report was adopted at a subsequent meet- 
ing and the necessary orders were made to put its provisions into 
execution. At the meeting of the board in March, 1864, the committee 
on military drill reported the success of the experiment, and the masters 
of the schools subsequently indicated their approval of the scheme and 
their satisfaction with the results. 
The committee did not propose to confine the new subject to tactical     
            
    
   
-P-A-G-E-559
PHYSICAL TRAINING. ~ 531 
drill only, but, as thetr original report clearly expressed, they thought 
the instruction should begin, with the younger classes, in gymnastics, 
which they considered well caleulated to adapt the pupils for military 
movements as well as of great utility in promoting their health and 
their capacity for study. No arrangements were made at once for the 
gymnastic feature contemplated by the report, but the plans of the 
committee on military gymnastics and drill were crystallized in a series 
of orders which were passed by the school board on December 
27, 1864. These provided for the constitution of a standing com- 
mittee of five, on “gymnastics and military drill,” to have general 
supervision of that branch; for the employment of an instructor in 
vocal and physical gymnastics, at a salary not exceeding $1,500 per 
annum; for the assignment of twenty minutes in grammar schools and 
thirty minutes in primary schools to yocal and physieal exercises daily; 
and for the instruction of all male pupils of sufficient size in grammar 
schools in military drill under the supervision of a suitable instructor. 
The time to be given to military drill was not to exceed two hours 
weekly, not including voluntary drills out of school hours. 
The standing committee was duly appointed as above contemplated, 
and they in turn employed as instructor of yocal and physical gym- 
nasties Mr. Lewis B. Monroe, who had already gained a wide reputa- 
tion as an accomplished gymnast and professor of elocution; and as 
instructor in military drill they secured Capt. Hobart Moore, who was_ 
fitted for the position because of actual service in the Army, and because 
of his experience as instructor inthe infantry department of the Massa- 
chusetts Rifle Club. 
It will be observed that these orders and the subsequent action of 
the committee indicate a departure from the original plan of making 
gymnastics contribute to a military training. The special committee 
was “on military gymnastics and drill;” the standing committee was 
“on gymnastics and military drill,” and instead of having gymnastics 
preparatory and subordinate to the drill, the drill was at that time 
considered to be merely a means of physical training—a phase of gym- 
nastics. As such its beginning was marked with many “ difficulties 
and inconveniences.” The masters of some of the schools doubted its 
utility and practicability, and strenuous opposition was developed in 
the school committee itself. It is significant that during the entire ~ 
discussion concerning military drill and its introduction in the schools, 
Superintendent Philbrick did not utter a word in its favor in any of 
his reports. The whole matter was referred to the committee on 
gymnastics and- military drill, and during the latter part of 1865_ 
the drill was discontinued in all the grammar schools. In the high 
schools military drill continues to this day, under the same instructor 
whose service has been continuous since its inception. Since 1865 no 
serious effort has been made to abolish it, and the Boston school regi- 
ment is now one of the most popular features of the school system. It

is sustained as a means of physical training because (1) of its freedom 
from accident or injury to the boys; (2) the boys enjoy it; (3) itis a 
good mental and moral discipline—the boy learns to obey, and that 
is the first step toward learning to command; (4) it helps to form 
character, conducing to patriotism, chivalry, love and defense of 
country and home; (5) it is a powerful aid in maintaining a high order 
of discipline in the schools, and an incentive to study, as the offices 
-are the rewards of good conduct and scholarship; (6) with limited 
means for physical training more can be done in the time allotted 
to the drill, two hours a week, than by any other method yet dis- 
cussed, for the same number of boys.! 
Mr. Monroe’s work began under much more favorable auspices 
than Capt. Moore’s. Enthusiastically supported by Supt. Philbrick 
and the school committee, he had apparently everything in his favor. 
At first he gave but a portion of his time to the schools, and received 
therefor $1,500 per annum, but later all his time was taken at a salary 
of $3,000 a year. In 1867, an assistant was employed for him in the 
person of Mr. A. E, Sloane, at $1,800, which was increased to $2,500 
the next year. 
In response to repeated requests for some written embodiment of his 
method, Mr. Monroe published, in 1869, a Manual of Physical and 
Vocal Training, in which he set forth the method “ practised by the 
writer during the last ten years, and taught in the Boston public 
_ schools under his supervision for three years past.” This book, then, 
should be the authoritative exposé of the exercises practiced in Boston 
during the Monroe period. Its first chapter consists of a few pages — 
lauding physical exercise and gymnastics, and leads oné to expect upon 
the subsequent pages a manual of light gymnastics worthy of the 
name; but after a few very mild exercises, not more than a dozen, all 
with the evident aim of strengthening the lungs and throat, the entire 
book is a text-book of elocution, pure and simple. And this same dif- 
ference between expectation and realization appears to have occurred 
‘in the Boston schools. : : 
The gymnastics which the special committee of November, 1863, 
wanted was ‘that preliminary physical training which is practiced in 
the best European schools and gymnasiums for months and years be- 
fore the tactics and manual of the soldier with his musket is begun;” 
the standing committee under the order of December 27, 1864, clearly 
intended that “ vocal gymnastics ” should be a subordinate part of the 
general subject, for they explained its incorporation on the ground that 
“proper exercises of the vocal organs are necessary in combination 
with general muscular exercises,” and that “since they ought to be 
included in any proper system, itis rather to call attention to them than 
to enlarge the field of instruction that they are mentioned.” 1

  PHYSICAL TRAINING. f < 533 
But of the twenty chapters in Mr. Lewis’s Manual, not more than 
five can be said to be given to gymnastics in any proper sense, and 
that same proportion probably represents the division of time between 
gymnastics and elocution in Mr. Monroe’s work in the schools. The 
natural result followed. Mr. Philbrick said in his eighteenth semi- 
annual report in 1869: 
That our schools have been benefited by the instruction in this department no 
longer admits of doubt in the minds of intelligent and unpréjudiced persons. It is 
scarcely possible to overrate the value of the improvement in reading which has 
been produced. * * * The vocal training which has been imparted, besides 
improving the reading, has done much to contribute to the instruction in vocal 
music. in all the grades of schools. The physical training has not proved * * * 
a complete antidote for the mischievous effects of high pressure. * * * I rejoice 
in what has been achieved, but I am by no means satisfied with present attainments 
in this direction. I frankly confess that I regard all that has been accomplished | 
only as a good beginning. We must not relax our efforts. We must be satisfied 
with nothing short of a complete revolution in respect to physical education. 3 
At the end of the next school year, thatis, in July, 1870, Mr. Sloane’s 
connection with the schools was severed at the instance of the stand- 
ing committee on physical and vocal training, and at the same time the 
terms of Mr. Monroe’s em ployment were so changed as to require his 
services for only three months in each year, and even that ceased in 
1871. 
_ For short periods during each of the following four years an instruc- 
tor was temporarily employed for the work that Mr. Monroe had laid 
down, but their work was even more on the elocutionary plan, and noth- 
ing of permanent value was done in gymnastics. The department of 
physical and vocal training was finally abolished in 1876. : 
This experience of the city of Boston furnishes a conspicuous exam- 
ple of the injury to a cause which may be done by an unwise selection 
of a teacher. With the proper instruction there is no reason why 
the gymnastics of the grammar schools should not have been as con- 
tinuous since its introduction and as popular as the military drill has 
been in the high schools. It is true that there was less popular inter- 
est throughout the country in gymnastics in 1871 and 1876 thanin 1860 
and 1864, but the same is true in an even greater degree of military 
instruction; the latter was pursued as enthusiastically in Boston in the 
seventies as in the sixties, and with much greater unanimity of support 
on the part of the school committee. But what had been called “ phys- 
eal,training ” had been tried and found wanting, and the unsuccessful 
experiment prevented any other attempt in the same direction. In 
further proof of this, a few isolated experiments, and the frequent 
references to the desirability of gymnastics, which may be found in the 
reports of the superintendent, the several committees of the board, and 
even of the school board itself, clearly show that the disposition of the 
school authorities toward gymnastics was still such that effective 
teaching of the subject would not have been treated as Monroe’s teach-
-P-A-G-E-562
    534 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
ing had been. In fact, Mr. Philbrick’s most powerful utterances in. 
favor of physical training are to be found in reports made in 1872, 1874, 
and 1876.. After Mr. Monroe’s separation from the schools there was a 
. gradual decline in the practice of even those exercises which he had 
prescribed, and in the course of time even she regulations requiring 
them became a dead letter. 
During the succeeding years there were occasional isolated and short- 
lived efforts to reestablish gymnasticsin certain schools, as, for instance, 
the employment of a Swedish lady to teach the Ling gymnasties in the 
Girls’ High School in 1874; and the establishment of a gymnasium 
according to Dr. Sargent’s ideas in the new Latin and English High 
School building in 1881; but there was no permanent result in either 
case, and no general movement to restore gymnastics as aregular school 
subject until several years later, when Mrs. Mary Hemenway took up 
_ the advocacy of the Swedish system. 
More or less has been known of the Swedish gymnastics in this coun- 
try from a comparatively early date. Without a special search for such 
references, laudatory notices of Ling’s work and methods have been 
discovered in educational publications as far back as 1830, and doubt- 
less the medical journals commented upon them much earlier still. 
Makers of calisthenic “systems” and gymnastic manuals, such as Miss 
Beecher, Mr. Mason, and Dio Lewis, have drawn largely upon Swedish 
sourees, while Swedish practitioners of the “movement cure” have 
always had “patients” who took the movements to prevent disease as 
well as those who desired a cure for disease already contracted. Noth- 
_ ing however, had ever been done on a large scale. 
The Swedish system of pedagogical gymnastics in public schools isa 
plant of recent growth in America, and it was in Boston that the seed 
was first planted. Mrs. Hemenway may be supposed to have been 
already interested in physical training, for the famous Hemenway 
gymnasium was the gift of her son, Mr. Augustus Hemenway, to Har- 
vard University, but her attention, it is said, was first attracted to the 
Swedish gymnastics by a pamphlet on Medical Gymnastics, by Mr. Nils 
Posse, a graduate of the-Royal Central Gymnastic Institute at Stock- 
holm, who had taken up his residence in Boston. Becoming interested 
in the new system, she organized in October, 1888, a class of 25 ladies, 
teachers in the Boston schools, under the direction of Mr. Posse, to test 
the adaptability of Swedish gymnastics in the public schools. Pleased 
with the success of her experiment, in May, 1889, she wrote to the school 
board, stating what had been done and offering to have ‘trained, with- 
out expense to the city, for one year, beginning September 1, 1889, 100 
public-school teachers, who were to be permitted to use the system in 
their school work, thus enabling the board and educators in general to 
decide upon the merits by actual results produced upon the school 
children in the schoolroom.” This offer was gladly accepted and the 
class was duly formed. Later she offered to provide for one year a

teacher of Ling gymnastics for the normal school, and still later to pro- 
vide free instruction “for those masters and submasters who desired 
to make a thorough study of the Ling system for the benefit of the 
Boston public schools.” These offers were also accepted by the board. 
The outgrowth of all this was the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics 
mentioned on a preyious page. 
In the meantime, and before any of Mrs. Hemenway’s offers were 
made, it had been proposed in the school board to establish a committee 
on physical exercises. This was not then deemed necessary, but the 
committee on hygiene already exi sting was specifically given full powers 
in the matter of physical exercise, and its members were increased from 
3 to 5. In response to a request from this committee the board of 
supervisors, in conjunction with the instructor in hygiene, made areport 
in October, 1889, reviewing the several systems of gymnastics and 
giving their unqualified preference to the Swedish system and strongly 
recommending its adoption. The committee on hygiene, in turn, urged 
the adoption of these recommendations by the school board, but no final 
action was taken, and the entire matter was referred to the school board 
for 1890. 
The physical training conference, also the result of Mrs. Hemenway’s 
liberality, added greatly fo the impetus that gymnastics had received, 
and in January, 1890, a standing committee on physical training was 
appointed, with Dr. W. A. Mowry as its chairman. This committee 
made an extended tour through the West and Northwest for the pur- ss 
pose of examining the different systems of physical and of manual train- 
ing in use in the various cities of the country, and on June 10 they 
reported the result of their investigations. Like the board of super- _ 
visors, they strongly favored the Ling system, and the result of their 
labors was the passage of the following orders, June 24, 1890: 
(1) Ordered, That the Ling or Swedish system of educational gymnastics be intro- 
duced into all the public schools of this city. 
(2) Ordered, That a director of physical training and one or more assistants be 
employed, the total salaries for the same not to exceed the sum of $5,000 per annum, 
and that the committee on physical training be authorized to nominate suitable 
persons for these positions, to commence at the beginning of the next school term. 
Dr. E. M. Hartwell, one of the most widely. known of the workers in the 
field of physical training, was chosen for the position of director under 
these orders, and entered upon his work January 1, 1891. In the fol- 
lowing March Mr. Hartvig Nissen was made assistant instructor of 
physical training, and in September Miss Laura.S. Plummer, a gradu- 
ate of the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics, was assigned to duty as 
teacher of gymnastics in the normal school. Upon these three persons 
rests the responsibility for the future of school gymnastics in Boston, 
and, to a great extent, of Swedish gymnastics in this country.

  536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
THE PRINCIPAL SYSTEMS OF GYMNASTICS, 
I. THE SWEDISH SYSTEM. 
It would be interesting to trace the progress of gymnastics in other 
European countries, particularly in Switzerland, France, and England, 
as well.as Sweden, but the time at the disposal of the writer has not 
been sufficient to. complete the work in time for publication in the doc- 
ument for which it is intended. 
The prominent place, howevez, which the Swedish gymnastics has 
attained in this country in the last few years! demands that some men- 
tion be made of the origin as well as the character of that system. 
As is well known, its originator was Peter Henrik Ling, who was 
born in the province of Smiland, S weden, in 1776. His father, a curate, 
was not heavily burdened with the world’s goods, and young Ling 
frequently felt the pangs of poverty. Nevertheless he managed to 
pursue his studies at Upsala, Copenhagen, and presumably at Berlin 
and Stockholm, where he resided during the early period of his life. 
While in Copenhagen he had an opportunity to observe the gymnastics 
of Nachtegall, whose work was mentioned upon a previous page, and 
it may be supposed that his attention was also directed more or less 
strongly to the various efforts making in Germany toward the revival 
of gymnastics during his residence there. It does not appear, however, 
“that he was moved thereby to attempt anything himself in the same 
line, but after his return to Stockholm he studied the art of fencing 
_under two French refugees, who had founded there a fencing school. 
Ling had been a sufferer from gout in his sword arm, and observed 
that his practice at fencing was beneficial. It is by no means improb- 
able that he was prompted to make the experiment by a study of Greek 
medical gymnastics, for in his later writings he makes frequent refer- 
ences to ancient authorities, and the idea toward which he constantly 
strove was to reproduce in the northern countries that favorable atti- 
tude toward gymnastics which existed in the lands and times of Plato, 
Hippocrates, and Galen. 
Whether this be true is a matter of conjecture, but it is certain that 
the fencing was the practical beginning of the system of gymnastics 
which he proceeded to elaborate. 
He considered anatomy and physiology as essentially necessary as 
the basis of rational gymnastics, and therefore began in 1805 an assid- 
uous study of those sciences. He conducted his researches with exceed- 
ing care, and refused to adopt any movement until he was convinced 
that.its physiological effect was beneficial. His application of gymnas- 
tics as a remedy for disease was the principal cause of the public inter- 
est that was manifested in his work; but it is as erroneous to ascribe 
to Ling the invention of medical gymnastics as it would be to credit 
1§ee pp. 521 and 534,

Gutsmuths with being the originator of gymnastics as a whole. The 
basic ideas of both men were derived from ancient sources; these were 
modified, extended, and improved by the enlightened judgment of 
modern students. Oredit is due them in no small degree for so improy- 
ing ancient systems as to make them meet the requirements of modern ~ 
science, but their work was one of popular agitation and of improve- — 
ment of detail rather than of original invention. * 
Ling early sought the aid of his Government in the establishment of 
an institution for the practical application of his idea upon a more 
extended scale than was otherwise possible. This plan was not favored. 
at first, and in 1812 the minister of public instruction, in replying to a 
letter from Ling, said: “‘ There are enough of jugglers and rope-dancers 
without exacting any further charge from the public treasury.” 
But Ling was a man of indomitable energy, and, so far from being 
discouraged by this rebuff, set to work to prove practically the value of 
hisideas. He began the practice of his curative movements upon a more 
extended scale in 1813, and so plainly apparent were the merits of his 
system and so wide was the public recognition that in 1814 he sueceeded 
in establishing the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute at Stockholm 
under the auspices of the Government. This has ever since been main- 
tained as a normal school, which all must attend who desire to be 
teachers of gymnasts in Sweden. Its work is in three departments, 
the first for instructors of military gymnastics in the army and navy, 
the second for teachers in the schools, and the third for the study of ° 
medical gymnastics. 
In the schools of Sweden the practice of gymnastics 1s now practically 
universal and has been for a number of years. This is true not only of 
the city schools, but of the higher schools, universities, eleemosynary 
institutions, and country schools as well. 
Ling constantly labored to improve his system, and after his death, 
in 1839, his successors in the Central Institute have continued his 
efforts for improvement. The essential principles, however, have 
remained unchanged, and a recital of some of the views and maxims of 
Ling will go far toward describing the Swedish system as it exists _ 
to-day. He divided the entire subject into four parts, namely, (1) 
pedagogical gymnastics, (2) military gymnastics, (3) medical gym- 
‘nastics, and (4) esthetic gymnastics. ) 
The first branch named above is defined to be “that by means “of 
which man teaches himself to bring his body under his own will.” The 
three other branches are sufficiently explained by their names. The 
first only comes within the scope of this paper and the following pages 
will be confined to that. 
Ling, from the first, recognized the importance of placing the prac-. 
tice as well as the theory of gymnastics upon a strictly scientific basis 
and insisted that the teacher be well equipped for his work, and that 
nothing be left to chance or the voluntary effort of the child. It

is natural, he argued, for one to desire fo do what is easiest for him or 
what he does best, but such a mode of procedure in gymnastics inevi- 
tably results in one-sided development. 
Some of his rules or maxims, taken principally from his work entitled. 
Gymnastikens Allminna Grunder, may be shown as an excellent pre- 
sentation of Ling’s idea of the aim and effects of gymnastic movements. 
(1) The aim of gymnastics is the harmonious development of the human body by 
means of well-defined exercises. = 
(2) Well-defined exercises are those which are carefully selected with a view to 
the particular body to be developed by the same. 
(3) A body is well-developed when all its parts are perfectly in harmony with each 
other and when they are developed as much as possible, considering the limitations 
of the individual's constitution. - 
(4) The human body ean not be developed beyond the limitations set by the con- 
stitution of the individual. 
(5) The lack of exercise may suppress, but can not destroy the inborn faculties. — 
(6) These faculties may be still further suppressed by improper exercises, which 
are more injurious than beneficial for the harmonious development of the body. 
(7) Stiffness or immobility in a certain part of the body is usually caused by too 
much strength of that part, and is always accompanied by a correspon¢ ing weakness 
in other parts of the body. 
(8) By means of evenly distributed exercise the excess of strength of one part of 
the body may be lessened, and the strength of the weaker parts increased. 
(9) The outward appearance of certain parts of the body is not a true measure of 
physical strength or weakness; that is determined by the relative proportion of all 
parts of the body. 
(10) Health and strength in the highest sense are univecal; both depend on tie 
mormal or harmonious activity of all parts of the body. 
(11)All true health and strength consist of the perfect symmetry of all parts of 
the body, and as the faculty of moving properly, swiftly, and perseveringly is 
always in equal relation to the physical strength of the body, each person requires 
an all-sided training. 
(12) To obtain and maintain the highest strength, one must become accustomed to 
those positions that interfere the least with one’s breathing and movements; the 
power of moving depends upon the power of breathing. 
(18) Since it is the purpose of gymnastics to produce harmony among the various 
parts of the body, it is not sufficient to practice movements of the arms and legs 
alone; the power of using them well depends upon the strength of the other parts of 
the body as well as upon their own. 
(14) If one commences the gymnastic exercises from théir simplest forms one can, 
step by step, advance to the most difficult exercises without the least danger of 
injurious effect; the pupil then knows his strength, what he is able to do, and what 
he is doing. - 
To carry out the aims thus indicated Ling employed (a) exercises 
without apparatus; (b) balancing, walking, jumping, swimming, etc.; 
(ce) exercises with apparatus; (d) gymnastic games. Of these he gave 
the preference to the exercises without machinery or apparatus, but 
with mutual assistance of pupils in some exercises. The following rea- 
sons were assigned for his preference: 3 
(1) The forms of these exercises are so simple that everybody can understand them 
and imitate them at sight. 
(2) These exercises can be performed in any place whatever, out-of-doors or 
‘in-doors, on the open field or road, and in a schoolroom or gymnasium,
-P-A-G-E-567

(8) A larger number of pupils can perform these exercises together, thus saving a 
great deal of time. 
(4) No apparatus is required, thus saving a great deal of pepeuee 
(5) ‘Through these exercises the pupils become accustomed to precision and strict 
attention, as each motion must be executed by several persons at the same time. 
(6) The help which one division must lend to the other awakens the sense of aid- : 
ing others, and to be polite and attentive. 
(7) Those who assist also have an opportunity to exercise, so that both the exer- 
cising division'and the assisting division practice together. 
(8) A more refined understanding of the ex 
porters than through lifeless machinery.    
  A good idea of the Swedish system of gymnastics may be gained from 
the writings of two gentlemen, graduates of the Gymnastic Central 
Institute, at Stockholm, who have resided in this country for several 
years. One of these, Mr. Nils Posse, now of Boston, Mass., in a little 
pamphlet entitled How Gymnastics are Taught in Sweden, says: 
The exercises are chosen for their physiological effects, so that only such are used 
as are needed for a desired result; all of doubtful or injurious effects are excluded. 
The development of the respiratory organs being of prime consideration, no move- 
ment is allowed to interfere with free respiration, and the utmost care is taken that 
the exercises should produce a proper carriage of head and thorax. As the move- 
ments are practiced for their effects on the body—not on an audience—wo do not 
drill, drill, drill the pupils on a certain movement so as to teach them the “trick” 
of it, but take each one’s ability into consideration, even though we consider that 
the form of the movement is of utmost importance. 
All the exercises are executed to words of command, as that is the only method by 
which the pupil is enabled to concentrate his whole attention upon one thing at a- 
time, all other methods, such as memorizing, imitation, the use of music, etc,, caus- 
ing him to think of one thing while doing another. 
The progression is very strict, so that the exercises not only grow from lesson to 
lesson, and are made to conform to the differences of age, sex, strength, nationality, 
etc., but also so that there is progression in every day’s lesson. Practical investi- 
gation having proved that the exercises could be made stronger, their effects more 
complete, and progression more rapid, if a certain order were observed in every les- 
son, this order was made the basis for the classification of the exercises. Thus our 
movements are grouped as (1) introductions; (2) arch flexions; (3) heaving move- 
ments; (4) balance movements; (5) shoulder-blade movements; (6) abdominal exer- 
cises; (7) lateral trunk movements; (8) slow leg movements; (9) jumping and vault- 
ing, and (10) respiratory exercises, each lesson containing one or more from each 
group in the order enumerated. 
The system is rational, for there is a scientific reason for everything that is 
adopted and used; and it is practical, for itis independent of apparatus. It can be 
applied anywhere and everywhere. The old-fashioned idea that a bath is a neces- 
ity sson in gymnastics has been discarded, thanks to a proper use of 
respiratory exercises; for by providing a greater elimination of water through the 
lungs, the skin evaporation does not increase to any marked degree; and no excess 
of perspiration occurring, there can be no need of a bath to prevent taking cold. 
The system is one of exercises and not of apparatus; nevertheless, apparatus is 
desirable, and hence a gymnasiuin is a much needed addition to every school.

- Inregard to “gymnastic progression,” he said before the American 
Association for the Advancement of Physical Education in 1890: 
For a clear understanding of gymuastic progression we must bear in mind the 
general composition of the Swedish gymnastic drill, or what is termed a ‘‘ gymnastic 
day’s order” (gymnastisk dagdfning). ‘‘Gymnastic day’s order” is a technical phrase 
that indicates something more than an ordinary space of time occupied in gym- 
nastic exercises. It is the practical, distinctively formulated expression of a clearly 
comprebended idea, a practical application of a distinct hygienic and educational 
line of thought. The ‘‘gymnastic day’s order” must be adequate to the demands of 
each day’s exercise within given limitations of space and time. It is composed of a 
certain number of movements succeeding each other in a well-defined order, calcu- 
-lated to produce certain effectsin a certain succession, all these movements together 
Leing designed to bring about a distinct hygienic and educational result, which is 
the exponent of what we term gyninastic “unity” and “totality.” Hygienic and 
e:lucational interests are interlaced with each other in the ‘‘ gymnastic day’s order,” 
as may be seen by an analysis of its constituents. 
As a further explanation of the “day’s orders” we may again quote 
Mr. Posse. At the conference on physical training in Boston in 1889, 
lie thus explained the meaning of the terms used by him in the ar ticle 
preyiously quoted: : 
(1) Introductions. By these we understand some simple exercises used at the 
' beginning of a lesson to gain a little general muscular control to correct the base 
and general position, ete. 
(2) Archflexions, which consist of backward flexions of the trunk. They have the 
effect of straightening the dorsal region of the spine, of vaulting the chest forward 
by drawing the lower ribs apart, thus increasing the chest capacity, and of culti- 
yating the extensibility of the upper region of the abdomen. 
(3) Heaving movements, which consist of various exercises in a hanging position, 
and others that have the effect of expanding the upper pare os the chest by lifting 
it upward; incidentally they also develop the arms. * 
(4) Balance movements. The two preceding exercises are strong, hence they 
Now, a rest ought to ensue—the word rest not 
to be understood as meaning inactivity, but changed activity—and the time is con- 
veniently filled by the gentle movements which we call balance movements. These 
require but little effort from any one of the many muscles brought into play; the 
heart beat is not increased by them, but it becomes lessened by the mechanical pro- 
pulsion of the blood into the legs (the more equal distribution of the blood pressure). 
‘At the end of a balance movement the pupil is again ready for more specific work. 
(5) Shoulder-blade movements consist of arm movements, which have the effect 
of placing the shoulder blades in correct position. * * * 
(6) Abdominal exercises bring into forcible play the abdominal walls. ‘Their effects 
are to incite peristalsis, to promote digestion, and to shorten the stay of the food in 
the intestinal canal, 
(7) Lateral trunk movements consist of rotations and sideway flexions, etc., of 
the trunk. They havea far-reaching effect on the general circulation by accelerating 
the flow in the inferior vena cava, leading the blood off from the abdomen and legs, 
ete. Incidentally they also expand the chest laterally and strengthen the muscles 
around the waist. 
(8) Slow leg movements. By this time the heart beat is again much increased. 
The slow leg movements furnish a means of lessening it, for by these the blood 
becomes mechanically propelled forward through the forcible, passive extension of 
some muscles, while others are in gentle active contraction. ‘These movements may 
be conveniently omitted when the previous exercises are not strong enough to make 
them a necessity. 
    '
-P-A-G-E-569
  
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 541 
(9) Jumping’ and vaulting. These exercises have the effect of cultivating the 
general elasticity of the body more than does any other form of movement. *.* * 
(10) Respirdtory exercises. These consist of deep inhalation and exhalation, “ 
accompanied by some arm movement that will expand and contract the chest in even 
rhythm With the respiratory act. The moyements, which can be conveniently com- 
bined with some movements of the legs or trunk, have the effect of restoring free 
respiration (the jumping putting the pupil out of breath) and to lessen the heart 
beat. Respiratory exercises are brought in not only at the end of every lesson, but 
at any time when their effects are needed, and often also at the beginning of a lesson 
containing strong exercises that require an increased amount of oxygen. z 
To the above it may be well to add the following from the pen of Dr. 
E. M. Hartwell, supervisor of physical training in Boston, Mass., and 
an ardent advocate of the Swedish system—for the elementary schools 
at least. The remarks quoted formed a part of a lecture delivered in 
Boston in 1891, and may be found in the Boston Medical and Surgical — 
Journal of December 24, 1891, and in a reprint from the same entitled 
“The principal systems of physical training compared :” 
His natural impulses and the exigencies of his position as an official teacher of 
teachers and of military cadets combined in leading Ling to adopt simple, direct, 
and orderly measures. He made use of both free and class exercises before Spiess 
introduced them into German gymnastics. Apparatus gymnastics, though regularly 
employed by the Swedes, are given less prominence than is accorded them by the 
Germans. Certain gymnastic machines, which are favorites with the Swedes, are 
not used in Germany and vice versa. Gymnastic games and fencing are employed 
both by Swedish and German teachers of school gymnastics. “Much less care and 
attention have been given in Germany than in Sweden to physiological considera- 
tions in the selection and arrangement of gymnastic movements; therefore the 
Swedes reject many forms of exercise as useless or injurious which pass muster in 
Germany. For example, the Swedes discard exercises that tend to constrict the 
chest, those that require the breath to be held, and those producing continued pres- 
sure on the larger vascular or nerve trunks. One of their most stringent rules is 
that all movements should help and not hinder full, free, and regular breathing. 
Swedish gymnastics surpass all other forms of pedagogical gymnastics in the care 
taken in coordinating the exercises belonging to a ‘single day’s orders” which have 
been practiced, and the ‘‘day’s orders” thatshall follow. By meaus of the day’s order 
or table and the principle of gymnastic progression, which they alone have worked 
out and adopted, the Swedes are enabled to order and vary their school gymnastics 
from day to day, from month to month, and from year to year in a graded series, 
By this means continuity is secured in the instruction, and the pupils, of whatever 
age or condition of health, are advanced from simple, easy, and absolutely safe exer- 
cises to those that are complicated, difficult, or comparatively dangerous. Class 
leaders and memorized drills have no place in instruction of this kind. All exer- 
cises, whether by a full class or by a squad, are executed at the word of command. 
Continuous, progressive, and comprehensive gymnastic training can not be secured 
by mere imitation of a leader, or by executing memorized exercises over and over 
again. Change and variety are necessary and must be had. They are best secured 
in school gymnastics by recognizing the laws of physiology and by following the 
principles of sound teaching. 2 
The foregoing extracts set forth those features of the Swedish sys- 
tem which seem to be its principal characteristics, but the presentation 
iS of course not a complete exposé of the system. For a thorough 
understanding of it one must examine not only the theory more care-

fully but the practical details as well. It would be impossible to pre- 
sent these fully here, and the reader is therefore referred to numerous 
pamphlets and manuals which have been published in late years con- 
taining discussions and descriptions of all the phases of the Swedish 
system. Among those which Gontain discussions of the theory may be 
mentioned the published proceedings of the Physical Training Confer- 
ence in Boston in 1889, of the several meetings of the American Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Physical Education, the several pam- 
phlets of Dr. E, M. Hartwell, Messrs. Claes J. Enebuske, Nils Posse, 
Hartvig Nissen, and others. Among the manuals of exercises are 
Enebuske’s Day’s Orders (Boston: Silver, Burdett & Co.); Nissens’s A 
BC of Swedish Educational Gymnastics (Philadelphia: F. A. Davis); 
Posse’s Handbook of School Gymnastics (Boston: Lee & Shepard). 
The Swedish apparatus are but little known in this country, and the 
only book in English, probably, which describes the exercises upon 
them is Posse’s Swedish System of Educational Gymnastics (Boston: 
Lee & Shepard). 
Il. Tuk GrrMAN System. 
The German gymnastics as it exists in America is not in all respects 
the same as German gymnastics upon its native heath. Certain features 
which are in the background in Germany are given a conspicuous place 
-in America to meet the criticisms which the system has met in this 
country, and certain other features prominent in-Germany are relegated 
to the rear here. The German system occupies a position similar to 
that of the regular school of medicine. Its adherents are always ready 
to adopt improvements and modifications coming from any source when 
such are shown to be desirable and beneficial, and they have been 
_quick to modify their practices to meet the demands of American expe- 
- rience. Graduates of the turners’ seminary at Milwaukee frequently 
speak of their system as the “German-American” or ‘German modified.” 
But the essential principles of the German system still remain. Never- 
theless, it is more desirable to show in this paper the German gym-- 
nastics as we know it rather than as it isin Germany, and the following 
extracts, therefore, are from German-American authorities, or from 
German writings indorsed by them, 
Unlike the Swedish system the German was not ‘‘made to order.” It 
was not devised to carry into effect a set of previously conceived physi- 
ologicalideas. It grew first; the minute examination of the physiological] 
aspects of its details came afterward. Following therefore the histor- 
ieal order of its development the extracts presented herewith were 
selected to show (1) the essential characteristics of German gymnastics 
and the difference between it andthe Swedish system; (2) the methods 
of German gymnastics; and (3) its physiological aspects.

COURAGE, STRENGTA, CHEERFULNESS, INDUSTRY, AND MORALITY ITS AIMS. 
Every turning institution is a place for exercising the bodily powers, a school of 
industry in manly activity, an aid to education, a protection to health, and a publie 
benefit. It is constantly and interchangeably a place of teaching and learning. In 
an unbroken circle follow constantly after each other direction, exemplification, 
instruction, independent investigation, practice, emulatie2, and further instruction. 
Thus the turners learn their occupation, not from hearsay nor from following 
after some transient expression. They have lived in and with their work; have 
investigated it, proved it, demonstrated it, experienced it, and perfected it. It 
awakens all the dormant powers, and secures a self-confidence and readiness which 
are never found ataloss. The powers grow only slowly; the strength increases 
gradually; activity is gained by little and little; a difficult feat is often attempted 
in vain, until at last attained by harder labor, greater effort, and unwearied indus- 
try. Thus the will is brought toward the wrong path of obstinacy to the habit of 
perseverance, in which is based all success. We carry a divine consciousness in the 
breast when we realize that we-can do whatever we choose if we only will. To see 
what others have at last found possible arouses the pleasant hope of also accom- 
plishing the same. 
In the turning association boldness is at home. When others are exercising in 
emulation with us, all exertion is easy, all labor is pleasure. Each at the same time 
~ strengthens the others by his labor, and confirms his own powers, and encourages and 
elevates himself. Thus the example of each beco nes a model for the rest, and accom- 
plishes more than a thousand lessons. No real deed was ever without result. 
* * * Bold, free, joyous, and pious is the realm of the turner. The universal 
code of moral law is his rule of conduct. To dishonor another would disgrace him, 
To become a model, an example, is what ho should strive after. His chief lessons 
are these: To seek the utmost symmetry in development and cultivation; to be 
industrious; to learn thoroughly; to intermeddle with nothing unmanly; to permit 
himself to be enticed by no seductions of pleasure, dissipation, or amusement 
such as are unsuitable for the young.—[{‘Father” Jahn in Die Deutsche Turnkunst. 
ITS BASIS NOT NARROWLY PHYSIOLOGICAL. 
There are certainly good features in Swedish gymnastics which haye been cheer- 
fully adopted by the Germans. It is, however, very curious to note that a system 
is condemned ‘‘as lacking scientific accuracy ” which has stood the test of so many 
years in a country where the scientific spirit of the medical profession ranks so 
high as is.the case with German physicians. To exercise one muscle, or group of 
muscles, after tho other in tedious succession, is certainly not enough to warrant a 
claim to scientific accuracy, except for medical or curative purposes, asin the case 
of abnormal, enfeebled, or diseased persons; and as to “ elasticity,” it is surely the 
just claim of the German system of gymnastics that it affords a vast amount of 
possibilities of adaptation to the greatest variety of conditions. It recognizes the 
living principle in the normal child, and treats this child not as a bundle of mus- 
cles, but as a psychic organism whose emotional qualities must be recognized as 
valuable elements in successful physical development. ‘In other words, it aims at 
enlisting the interest of the child, its joyful and active spirit, among the agencies 
for the promotion of its physical development, and endeavors to avoid: falling into 
the error of systematizing the exercises on purely physiological grounds. The dif-. 
ference, in a nutshell, between the Swedish and German systems of gymnastics is 
this, that the former has a narrow physiological, the latter a broad, psycho-physio- 
logical basis.—[Dr. Maximilian P. E. Groszmann, director of the New York Work- 
ingman’s School. in the School Journal, December 23, 1893.

544 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. ‘ : 
THE METHODS OF GERMAN GYMNASTICS. 
The German system has been diligently built-up during almost a century by men 
of science, especially physicians, physiologists, and pedagogues of high reputation. 
It isin practical use since that time, and is to-day in yogue in many European coun- 
tries in a more or less modified form. In the army, as military gymnastics; in the 
education of the youth, as school gymnastics; in the halls of the German turners, 
as popular gymnastics. 
It is practiced in classes by hundreds at the same time, as well as by single indi- 
viduals as home exercises. 
The German system embraces all the different branches of gymnastics; exercises 
with apparatus, light gymnastics, or calisthenics, and also those exercises known as 
out-door sports, as running, leaping, jumping, throwing the stone, and the use of all 
hand apparatus, as wands, dumb-bells, and clubs. 
The German system has three marked features which no other system can claim in 
so predominant @ manner: 
I. It aims at general physical culture, and not at the culture of one special branch. 
Therefore it declines the development of a certain organ or faculty at the expense of 
others,» In regard to this we may call attention to the fact that all who have gone 
through a regular course of exercise in accord with this system have been thoroughly 
developed, and rank as high in. proficiency as any person educated by another sys- 
tem. The contests among tho turners’‘are thus arranged, that exercises in all the 
different branches must be performed. This is also the case when testing scholars 
in regard to their proficiency. The numbers gained, added together, decide the 
grade of development. The strife for specialities is even not permitted, and a par- 
tial or one-sided deyelopment is therefore unknown. Yet this does not prevent 
individual skill and inclination from bringing about a greater result in a certain 
branch; this result, however, is not gained by a loss or lack in any other branch. 
II. It allows or rather induces the exercises in classes. The classes are selected 
by a careful investigation as to strength, ability, age, ete., and for that reason it 
suits as well those who practice merely for physical development as those who aim 
at a proficiency of a higher grade. The exercises in classes are a source of endless 
pleasure, refreshment of mind, and joyfulness,not only to children, but even to 
adults. They are, furthermore, an inducement for promotion and the ambitious 
desire to keep step with other scholars. They act as a stimulant for greater exer- 
tion. It is undeniable truth that all those who have continually practiced in a 
German gymnasium, or in a school in which the German system of gymnastics had 
been introduced, acknowledged that the hours spent there count among the happiest 
of their childhood or manhood. The variety and great number of exercises of the 
German system and their scientific arrangement allow new and indefinite combina- 
tions. The teacher can always select a certain number of exercises suitable for his 
class, which are as agreeable, as instructive and interesting to every one of the class- 
mates. Not only the body, but also the mind, is kept in a wholesome and refreshing 
activity which will keep away all weariness and tediousness which are so often 
found in other systems. - The class exercises of the German system allow also the 
instruction of a large number at the same time, providing sufficient room is at hand. 
Ill. The instruction begins with the most simple and easy movements and pro- 
ceeds gradually to a higher degree. All fear of danger or harm to the body is a 
priori excluded. ‘The apparatus used in school practice is not at all complicated or 
expensive. A number of climbing-poles, ladders, and some light apparatus for the 
high and long leap are sufficient. They may even be omitted altogether, if the neces- 
sary room for such could not be provided for. In this case, however, we can not — 
call the training a complete one, as the aim of* training is not only the achievement 
of a development of muscles, limbs, and organs, but also the achievement of courage 
and self-reliance, 
   
-P-A-G-E-573
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 545 
In the German gymnasia and schools the lessons begin regularly with a series of 
free and order exercises. Every scholar has to participate in them. The rythmical 
order in which they are produced calls forth absolute attention, and allows no back- 
wardness. They impress on each a feeling of responsibility toward his associates. 
The mistakes or errors, or an insufficient execution of any one, injures the good 
impression of the whole, and thus tends to greater carefulness and prevents negli- 
gence on the part of the scholars. 
Class exercises on apparatus follow the free exercises. A change of apparatus 
takes place, and then the lesson ends with some exercises left to individual inclina- 
tion. The latter, however, are limited to a short time, according to the ability of 
the scholars, or may be prohibited altogether to beginners. Thus under the eye 
and control of the teacher a sense of activity and liveliness is exhibited which the 
educator will look upon with satisfaction and delight.—[Mr. Heinrich Metzner, 
principal of the school of the New York Turnverein, before the Physical Training 
Conference. 
THE GERMAN VIEW OF THE PHYSIOLOGY OF GYMNASTICS. 
Can a satisfactory state of bodily development be reached speedily, or even at all, 
by exercising certain muscles or sets of muscles? If this question is answered in the 
negative the Swedish system, of course, can not stand. But even though the answer 
be in the affirmative, the question would still not be settled, for it would yet be open 
to discussion which of the two systems should have the preference, since without 
any doubt the highest degree of physical development is attained by the German sys- 
to A ee 
First of all the mistaken idea that we can contract certain muscles at will must 
be set aside. Although we may have a very good idea of the amount of exertion 
necessary to perform or cut short a movement and for the direction in which thisis 
done, yet in a healthy condition we are not aware that we have muscles. If we 
contemplate a motion or exhibition of strength toward a certain object, we do this 
without taking into consideration the muscles which are to be brought into play. 
This is so true that most people are highly surprised when they discover that the 
fingers of themselves are motionless, but that the muscles which cause their motion 
are situated in the fore-arm. But the understanding of the existence and situation 
of the muscles does not change these conditions. The most thorough anatomist and 
physiologist, who is as conservant with his body as the watchmaker with the watch, 
proceeds in the same manner as an uneducated person or an animal. Now it is cus- 
tomary that even the simplest movements, like bending and straightening the hinge 
joints, is not performed by the action of a single muscle, but by several muscles 
which are similar in their action. This is also true of the ball and socket joints 
when we wish to perform an exercise which requires a rotary motion. Therefore, if 
we design or perform motions, we can do so only by such groups of muscles, but 
never, as the opinion claims, by a single muscle. 
Experience teaches us that muscles become stronger through exercise and, within 
a certain limit, they increase in size; muscles which are not contracted at times 
become weakened. The plan of developing the body by exercising certain sets of 
muscles methodically, giving regular practice to each single one, appears to be at 
the first glance quite reasonable. A closer examination, however, will show that 
this plan accomplishes too much on the one hand and not enough on the other. 
This method accomplishes too much, on the one hand, because, in order to bring 
about the development of all the sets of muscles, it is scarcely necessary to exercise 
each one singly. In the case of a machine as is represented by the muscular system 
a good result, in a certain direction, can not in a general way be obtained without 
having many if not all muscles brought into play, even though not simultaneously. 
How many muscles are there, for instance, which are not brought into play at all in 
vaulting? The suitable arrangement of several such exercises furnishes an excel- 
ED 92. 35  
-P-A-G-E-574
    546 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
lent means ef avoiding tediousness, which is necessarily brought about by the sys- 
tematic exercise of all single sets of muscles. 
This plan, on the other hand, and this is the principal point, accomplishes too lit- 
tle, for it is not the sole purpose of bodily development to give to all sitgle muscles 
the highest degree of strength. I can picture to myself a person possessing the mus- 
cles of a Hercules who would not be capable of walking or standing, much less of 
performing complicated exercises. It would only be necessary for me to rob him of 
the power to properly control his movements—to bring about his intoxication, for 
instance. 
This makes it clear that the work performed by the body as an apparatus of move- 
ment is as essentially dependent upon the correct cooperation of the single-muscle 
groups as upon the strength necessary to contract them. In order to perform a 
complicated movement, for instance a jump, the muscles must begin to work in the 
proper order of succession, and their enengy, in the sense of Helmoltz, must increase 
according to a certain rule, sustain itself, and relax in order that there may result 
a correct position of the limbs, and that the changing of the center of gravity be 
effected rapidly and in the proper direction. 
In addition to this, in all such complicated exercises, the use of the two senses, 
sight and touch, are necessary to quickly comprehend the situation at any moment, 
and the mind must be prompt to decide what must be done in accordance with the 
message of these senses. Al] forms of bodily skill, such as dancing, skating, riding, 
swimming, fencing, etc., depend in the end on a complicated activity and on the 
suitable interaction of impressions obtained through the senses, of which we are 
only partially conscious. All these accomplishments, therefore, pertain equally as 
much to the nervous system as to the muscles, and the skill acquired therein, as is 
well known, bears no relation whatever to the absolute strength of the muscles. The 
same is true of gymnastics. Most people entertain the erroneous idea that gymnas- 
tics never is anything but an exertion and exercise of the muscles, because these are 
the more noticeable parts of the body in motion and their existence and action are 
more casily understood. But all gymnastics is as much exercise for the nervous sys- 
tem as for the muscles. The failure to recognize this second feature of all physical 
culture is the unpardonable fundamental error of the Ling system, and this alone 
suffices to prove that from a physiological point of view it is worthless. However 
long anyone might exercise the muscles according to the Ling system of gymnastics, 
he would be inferior to the average German gymnast, who from the beginning has 
combined the gymnastics of the nerves with the gymnastics of the muscles, in case 
they should find themselves confronted by any actual task, the successful perform- 
ance of which depends upon a suitabie use and control of the muscular powers before 
fence and ditch, on a rock or wall, among the branches of the trees, amidst the rig- 
ging, wherever a sharp cye and clear head are required, and where it may be neces- 
sary to alternately use the foot in place of the hand and the hand instead of the 
foot. The body developed according to the Ling system will always remain a mere 
aggregate of bundles of muscles, resembling an irregular throng of stout warriors; 
but the body trained according to the German system presents the picture of a well 
organized, well drilled army, obedient to every command, the single elements of 
which will not, for that reason, be lacking in strength. * * * If itis true, in the 
* first place, that manifold combined movements suffice to give each single set of mus- 
cles an adequate amount of exercise without systematic practice of all of them; if, 
in the second place, it is true that the mere practice of single sets of muscles does 
not make the body capable of executing combined movements, but that these, in 
addition thereto, must receive special attention, then it follows unquestionably 
that the Swedish system of gymnastics is almost equal to a perfect waste of time in 
the physical education of the youth. 
Ten years before Ling and his system were heard of in Berlin, every lesson was 
begun in the gymnasium of Eiselin with the so-called exercises of the joints, which
-P-A-G-E-575
  
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. - 547 
were in reality calisthenics. For beginners these exercises constituted the first 
course, and for the more.advanced they formed a graded introduction for the more 
difficult requirements, and for all a guide to exercises which could be continued 
daily, even in the room without apparatus. As these exercises were carried on by 
many conjointly, they furnished an opportunity of developing prompt obedience in 
the rank and file of the participants. Finally, inasmuch as they gave systematic 
training to the human body in the fundamental movements, they served to supply 
the defects, which were, perhaps, contained in the complex exercises, in regard to 
the uniform exertion of all tho sets of muscles. Such exercises have not only since 
that time been éontinually practiced at the different German gymnasiums, but have 
even been more fully developed, so far as was consistent with the increase in the 
number of beginners. * * * To the extent demanded by the German system, 
these exercises fully accomplish the task which is deemed necessary in the Swedish 
system, namely, to accustom the undeveloped body to the exercise of single sets of 
muscles before more difficult tasks are required. The German system, however, does 
not, like the Swedish, keep the scholar forever at this preparatory work, but allows 
him, even in the first lesson, to pass on to some exercise of a more advanced nature 
in which he may take a delight. 
This brings us to the other fundamental error of the Ling system, which shows 
the founder to be as poor a pedagogue as a physiologist. ‘‘The Swedish system of 
gymnastics in its purity could not be recommended exclusively for the bodily devel- 
opment of our youth. For delicate children it is too severe; on the other hand, it is 
not sufficiently animating and fatiguing for older ones. Even boys wish to accom- 
plish something through their efforts and to advance in their work. This is not 
realized in the practice of the Swedish system, because they can not as yet compre- 
hend the various positions and movements. The Swedish gymnastics may be 
sufficient to strengthen the single muscles and the entire body; it is not adapted, 
however, for rendering the youth conscious of his own strength and courage, and 
realizing that physical dexterity which is of such importance for life.” In these 
words Privy Counselor Langenbeck himself exposes as mercilessly as the most pro- 
nounced antagonist of Swedish gymnastics the lamentable psy chological foundation 
of the Ling system. It remains to be added that really only the sick, for the sake 
of their health and at the command of their doctor, are able to bear the terrible 
monotony of the “rational gymnastics.” * * * My own experience with German 
gymnastics, extending over a largo number of years, has made me conversant with 
the same, and as a physiologist Ehave given my special attention to a study of the 
motions of the body. In the foregoing I have endeavored to show what the conelu- 
sions must be concerning the fundamental idea of Swedish gymnastics according to 
physiology. This idea is wrong in every particular. Should anyone-ask me to 
pass a scientifically critical opinion upon the parallel-bar exercises, from a physio- 
logical standpoint, I should have to admit that I would be placed in an embarrassing 
position. I confess that I am not able to form an adequate conception of the mean- 
ing to be conveyed. I can conceive only of this—that Dr. Abel desires every paral- 
Jel-bar exercise to be analyzed in such a manner that the share of each muscle in the 
exercise is to be recorded as a function of time, in order that he might therefrom 
decide as to the suitability and compatibility of such exercises. 
Should that be his idea, I doubt in the first place whether he has a conception of 
the nature and difficultiés of such an analysis. The truth of the matter is that such 
an analysis leads to the most intricate and tedious discussions, even when applied 
to much simpler movements, such, for instance, as a swing forward or backward on 
the parallel bars. These discussions would require the most exact knowledge of 
the anatomist and the most complete understanding of analytical mechanics, and 
they have been entirely eliminated from the study of physiology because their con- 
sideration was not attended by proper results. 
In the second place, I doubt whether Dr. Abel could make any use of such analy- 
 
-P-A-G-E-576
  548 « EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
sis, even if there were one. I have at different times exercised with professional 
anatomists and physiologists through an entire term at the gymnasium of Eiselin. 
I can’t recall that any opportunity presented itself to apply our theoretical knowl- 
edge to the exercises in which we vied with each other, because there exists the 
same chasm between such views and exercises as there is between theory of voice 
and singing. A knowledge of the muscles and nerves, the combination of forces, 
and the classification of levers unquestionably assists the teacher of gymnastics in 
the same manner that an understanding of John Mueller’s doctrine of the compensa- 
tion of the forces of the larynx is of benefit to the instructor of vocal music. The 
teacher of music is not thereby enabled to tell his scholar how he is to proceed in 
order to produce a certain tone, and in the same way the anatomic-physiological 
knowledge is of no avail in the gymnasium. If the apostles of Ling wish to impress 
upon us that they can accomplish something of importance in this way, it is proba- 
ble that they deceive themselves; at all events, they will cause professional men, 
such as Edward Weber, Herman Meyer, Adolph Fick, and others, to laugh incredu- 
lously at their assertions, Butif this be not the case, why do they never go beyond 
the use of such commonplaces? Why do they not give us a proof that these exer- 
cises on the bars can be classified in a scientifical and critical manner, on a physio- 
logical basis, instead of discarding the bars which, of course, is the easier thing to 
Gila ers ecu 
It may seem strange for a physiologist to consider his own science of less practi- 
cal importanee than those who are not proficient therein and that he should oppose 
any appeal to the same. But a more profound knowledge, if I may be permitted to 
use this expression, often makes one modest, whereas he who has a smattering only 
is puffed up with conceit; and that which is revered as of the greatest value we 
most dislike to see abused for the purpose of giving a weak cause the appearance of 
solidity and of imparting to empty statements an air of seriousness. 
‘There are two ways, says Abbe Galiani, of determining the contents of a bowl. 
You will either have to send the bowl to a mathematician, who will make certain 
measurements and computations, and possibly after a half year will be able to hand 
you the final equation, filled with unknown quantities which, however, may prove 
to be incorrect; or you will simply have to place the bowl in a horizontal position 
and, making use of a measure, fill the same, and you will have the solution. 
Many human affairs are like calculating the contents of a bowl, and this is the 
case with gymnastics. Itis laughable to bring forward exuberant theories when 
simple expericnce meets every requirement. The discovery and arrangement of 
bodily exercise does not depend upon theorems, upon anatomy, and physiology. We 
are endowed naturally with all the knowledge of anatomy and physiology that we 
need, and this will no more desert us in gymnastics than in any other bodily action 
in which science is of just as little use. 
Nothing can be more foolish than to prohibit any bodily exercise which can mani- 
festly be carried out without incurring any risk because they do not conform with 
preconceived opinions. I must admit that I agree absolutely with the observations 
of the gymnastic council of Berlin in its second memoir. That which the body is 
capable of doing is reasonable, and the body only can set itself limits. In answer 
to this it has been claimed, on the side of the apostles of Ling that, in language 
study, practice would be necessary in grunting, snarling, screaming, in fact, in 
producing'all discordant sounds. The inquirer will, perhaps, understand why this 
is not done if he will make it plain to himself why Swedish gymnastics pays no 
attention to face contortions, which would be just as reasonable. And, if it be 
argued further that crimes are just as permissible as the wheels on the horizontal 
bar for the reason that they would be possible, such a palpable sophism would 
prove to what straits the opponent is driven.—[Prof. Emil du Bois-Raymond, of the 
University of Berlin, in Swedish Gymnastics and German Gymnastics.

The extracts presented are taken from a great mass of material upon 
German turning. Comparatively little of it has been written or trans- 
lated into English, especially upon the theoretical side, but there is 
enough to give a good idea of the merits of the system. The officials of 
the N. A. Turnerbund are always ready to furnish information, and they 
have issued a number of valuable pamphlets, which may be obtained 
gratis by earnest investigators. Mr. J. Rudolf Bollinger, No. 118 
North Third street, St. Louis, Mo.,is now corresponding secretary of 
the Bund, and Mr. W. A. Stecher, No. 1830 Papin street, St. Louis, 
Mo., is secretary of the technical committee. Among the manuals 
of school gymnastics are: A System of Physical Culture, by Carl Betz, 
Kansas City, Mo.; Manual of Physical Culture, by Anton Leipold, 
Columbus, Ohio; Gymnastics in the Schoolroom, by Haus Ballin, San- 
dusky, Ohio, and the Manual of Henry Suder, Chicago, Ill. These 
gentlemen are the directors of physical training in the public schools 
of their respective cities. The Code Book of Gymnastic Exercises, by 
L. Puritz (Milwaukee, Wis.: Freidenker Publishing Company), relates to 
heavy gymnastics. A System of Physical Education, Theoretical and 
Practical, by Archibald Maclaren (London: Maemillan & Co., Henry

      If the work of Dr. D. A.Sargent, the director of the Hemenway Gym- 
nasium, at Cambridge, Mass., were expunged from the field of gymnastics 
it would be found that America’s original contributions to the cause of 
physical training have been lamentably few. But with his inventions 
America is able to make a very respectable showing of originality. 
His “chest weights” in their various forms, and his other machines in 
the American gymnasium give it an individuality and a national char- 
acter that it would otherwise lack. 
The athletic clubs, the Young Men’s Christian Association, and most 
of the college gymnasiums have adopted Dr. Sargent’s ideas very 
largely, and the following extracts from his address before the Physical 
Training Conference are, therefore, useful in describing the practices of 
those gymnasiums as well as that at Harvard under Dr. Sargent’s 
immediate supervision: 
In the fall of 1869 I accepted a position as director of the gymnasium at eon 
College, Brunswick, Me. 
At that time I began to make measurements of students and to observe the differ- 
ences in size, strength, and development that characterized different habits and con- 
ditions of life. 
Two years later attendance at the gymnasium was made compulsory to all classes, 
and I was called upon to devise a system of exercises that would be at once efficient,

progressive, and popular, In thinking this matter over I could not shut out from 
my mind the marked difference in physique of the men who had come under my 
observation, * * * 
In looking over the records of the students I had examined I found that the young 
men who had been accustomed to walk long distances to and from school, and to 
spena certain portions of the year doing manual labor on farms, in mills, lumber 
yards, etc., generally showed a superior physique, unless the work had been exces- 
sive and begun at too early a period. Moreover, I found that the young men who 
had been accustomed to special employment, such as blacksmithing, wood-chopping, 
milking cows, etc., showed a special development in certain parts of the body, as 
the forearm,upper arm, and back, while they were lacking in the development of 
other parts. 
In this way I went through the list, marking the peculiar development that seemed 
to accompany the special occupations and exercises to which the boys had given 
attention before coming to college. : 
The conclusion that I reached was this: If actual labor will produce such good 
physical results in certain directions, why will not a system of exercises in the gym- 
nasium, resembling actual labor, accomplish the same result in opposite directions, 
and in this way be made to supplement the deficiencies of one’s occupation and to 
develop him where he is weak. 
With this idea predominating, I began to work for its attainment in 1871. 
The nearest approach that I could make to the realization of this idea at Bowdoin 
College, for lack of funds, was the establishment of a lot of crude pulley-weight 
appliances of different heights and weights to which I introduced the students as 
a class exercise. 
Pulling window weights over a wooden roller by aid of an iron handle, in a cold, 
unfinished building four times a week, did not impress the faculty as an exercise 
that would be likely to add to the popularity of the required system, and I think 
that they had some doubt as to the expediency of letting an instructor, ‘‘who was 
only a freshman,” try the experiment. The experiment was tried, however, and it 
proved so successful that I was able to leave the department the next year in charge 
of assistants, who were also students, and spend three months in New Haven trying 
to introduce the same system at Yale College. 
I mention this fact in order that you may see that the success of the new move- 
ment was largely due to the peculiarity of the exercise, and not to any personal 
force or character behind it. In fact, I now know that I hit upon one of the great 
principles that should govern all artificial exercise, without knowing it. - (Of this I 
shail speak later.) 
I ought to add that we used the wooden dumbbells and Indian clubs to alternate 
with the pulley-weight appliances in class exercises. * * * 
After the completion of my medical studies, in 1878, I elaborated my old system 
of measurements, and had the first patterns of my long-contemplated developing 
appliances constructed. 
These consist of what are familiarly known as chest weights, chest expanders 
and developers, quarter circles, leg machines, finger machines, etc., to the number 
of forty different pieces. = 
These appliances were first used in my private institution in New York City in 
1878, and were placed in the Hemenway Gymnasium in 1879. It would seem that 
this style apparatus meta long-felt want, for it immediately sprang into popular 
favor. 
As it had been publicly announced that these appliances were not patented, but 
were given to the public for educational purposes, they were soon copied in one 
form or another by various manutacturers, and have since been generally introduced 
into the school, college, athletic club, and Young Men’s Christian Association gym- 
nasia throughout this country and in different parts of Europe. 
   
-P-A-G-E-579
          PHYSICAL TRAINING. 551 
To what extent this style of apparatus is now used in the United States may be 
inferred from the fact that some of it has been put into 350 cr more institutions, 
representing a total membership of over 100,000. * ~ * 
That you may understand what the system is in its present form, as carried out 
at Harvard University, let me ask you to follow me through one of the physical 
examinations of a student, and see what we do forhiim. Every student who enters 
the university is entitled to an examination, and 87 per cent of the whole number 
avail themselves of this privilege. 
As soon as the student presents himself at the director's office (which is done by 
application and appointment), he is given a history blank, which ho fills out, giving 
his birthplace, nativity of parents, occupation of father, resemblance to parents, 
natural heritage, general state of health, and a list of the diseases he has had, all 
of which information is absolutely necessary in order for the examiner to put a 
correct interpretation upon the observations to follow. The student is then asked 
to make certain tests of the muscular strength of the different parts of his body 
and to try the capacity of his lungs. 
He then passes into the measuring room and has his weight, height, chest girth, 
and fifty other items taken. His heart and lungs are then examined before and 
after exercise and a careful record made of the condition of the skin, muscles, spine, 
etc., which the tape measure fails to give. 
All the items taken are then plotted on a chart, made from several thousand meas- 
urements, and the examiner is then able to know the relative standing of this 
individual as compared with others for every dimension taken, also his deviation 
fromsymmetry and the parts which are ‘in special need of development. 
Tocontirm the plotting of the chart, and to awaken in the young man a genuine 
interest in his physique a photograph of each student desiring it is taken in three 
positions, and preserved for comparison with those to be taken of him later. 
From the data thus procured a special order of appropriate exercises is made out 
for this student with specifications as to the movements and apparatus he may best 
use. At the present time this special order consists for most students of an illus- 
trated handbook, in which the apparatus, the weights for it, and the times to use it 
are carefully prescribed, together with such suggestions as to exercise, diet, sleep, 
bathing, clothing, etc., as will best meet the needs of the individual under consid- 
eration. 
Now I think it will be admitted by all thoughtful persons that one-halfthe battle 
for mental education has been won when you arouse in a boy a genuine love for 
learning. So one-half the struggle for physical training has been won when he can 
be induced to take a genuine interest in his bodily condition, to want to remedy his 
defects, and to pride himself on the purity of his skin, the firmness of his muscles, 
and the uprightness of his figure. 
Whether the young man chooses afterwards to use the gymnasium, to run, to row, 
to play ball, or saw wood for the purposo of improving his physical condition mat- 
ters little, provided he accomplishes that object. 
The modern gymnasium, however, offers facilities for building up the body that 
are not excelled by any other system of exercise. The introduction of the new 
developing appliances has opened up the possibility of the gymnasium to thousands to 
whom it was formerly an institution of doubtfulvalue. The student is no longer com- 
pelled to compete with others in the performance of feats that are distasteful to him. 
He can now compete with himself, that is, with his own physical condition from 
week to week, and from month to month. Ifhe is not strong enough to lift his own 
weight, the apparatus can be adjusted to a weight he can lift. If he is weak in the 
chest or the back, he can,spend his time and energy in strengthening those parts 
without fear of strain or injury. 
In fact he can work for an hour, going from one piece of apparatus to another, 
keeping always within the circuit of his capacity, and adding slowly and surely to 
 
-P-A-G-E-580
        552 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. ° 
his general strength and powers of endurance. If the heart is weak, the lung capac- 
ity small, the liver sluggish, the circulation feeble, or the nervous system impaired, 
ete., special forms of exercise can be prescribed to meet these conditions. 
Gentle running is usually advised as a constitutional exercise forall of those who 
can take it. This is usually severe enough to start the perspiration andmake a bath 
of some kind desirable. A tepid sponge or shower bath is generally advised; and 
in my opinion, the bath which regularly follows the exercise at the gymnasium, and 
the habit of bathing established thereby, is almost as valuable as the exercise itself. 
After a period of six months or more the student returns again to the director’s 
office, and has another examination, in order to ascertain what improvement he has 
made and to receive any new suggestions. 
This, in brief, is the educational part of the system of physical training carried on 
at the Hemenway Gymnasium. *- * * Now let me invite your attention to a con- 
sideration of some of the theories and principles upon which it is founded. 
“The characteristic physiological property oi muscular tissue, and that for which 
it is employed in the body,” says Martin,’ ‘is the faculty possessed by its fibers of 
shortening forcibly under certain circumstances.” This property is called contrac- 
tility, and upon the full performance of this function depends not only the healthy 
condition of the muscles, but of the various parts of the body’ with which they are 
connected. 
Now, what are the circumstances under which a muscle performs its greatest con- 
traction? 
First. There must be a succession of strong and oft-repeated stimuli. Second. 
The muscle must have a load to carry or resistance opposed to its shortening. 
This can be illustrated by the experiment so often conducted in the physiological 
laboratory. Take a muscle without a weight attached to it, and apply a stimulus. 
The muscle will contract, say a quarter of an inch. Now apply a weight of 1 pound 
to it and apply the same stimulus. The muscle will contract half an inch. Attach 
a still heavier weight, say 2 pounds, and apply the same stimulus, and the muscle 
will contract 1 inch. 
And so the experiment could be carried on until a weight was attached which 
would cause the contractions of the muscles to be less and less until they finally 
ceased. ‘So that up to a certain limit, resistance to the shortening of a muscle 
makes it more able to shorten, and the greater extension of the muscle due to the 
greater resistance opposed to its shortening puts it into a state in which it is able to 
contract more powerfully.” 
Upon the interpretation of this simple physiological fact depends the foundation 
of two great systems of physical training—one faction advocating that the antago- 
nizing muscles in free movements, without apparatus, furnish all the resistance that 
is necessary; while the other faction claim that the resistance afforded by opposing 
muscles is not sufficient, and that weights of some kind, or apparatus, is neessary to 
bring out the working force of the muscle used. 
I believe that the last conclusion is the correct one. 
We saw in the laboratory experiment that when the muscle simply lifted its own 
weight that it did no work, and that nothing was accomplished when it tried to 
lift a weight too heavy for it, but that there was an intermediate weight that it 
lifted to the greatest height and did the greatest amount of work. 
What is true of this single muscle is true of all the muscles of the body; there is a 
certain weight with which the different groups of muscles can do the most effective 
service in agiven time. If the weight is too light or too heavy the best effect of the 
exercise is not realized. 
This may be illustrated by the familiar use of the chest-weights (so called). If 
you go through the movements without any weight the exercise is insipid. If, on 
the other hand, you load the boxes up to their full capacity you will find that there Hie eee 
  1 The Human | Body” (Chapter X), by H. Newell Martin, D. SC., M. A., M. D.  
-P-A-G-E-581
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 553 
are only one or two movements that you can do, and these only for a minute or so. 
Now, if you have carefully gauged your strength to about 5 pounds (which is, per- 
haps, the average weight used in these appliances), you will find that you can go 
through the full set of exercises (comprising some forty or fifty separate movements) 
and feel that you have accomplished something that will be a benefit to you. This 
statement is equally true of all the different developing appliances found in a well- 
equipped gymnasium, and to the fact that our modern apparatus can be adjusted to 
the strength of the strong and the weakness of the weak, may be attributed a large 
part of the value and popularity of those thriving institutions. 
But there is another principle now taken advantage of, to which the modern gym- 
nasium owes a great part of its efficiency. In view of the tendency of the times I 
can not help thinking that it is a valuable one. 
In primitive races individuals of the same tribe bear a close resemblance to sash 
other. As they progress in civilization difference of function begins to work a dif- 
ference in structure, and we begin to get a marked variation in size, form, and fea- 
ture. 
In highly civilized communities the minute division of labor carries this variation 
still further, so that it is not only possible in many cases to distinguish individuals 
by their calling, but the particular branch of work in which they are engaged can 
be easily determined by its influence upon their physical structure. In other words, 
men are molded by their trades and occupations, and many of the diseases with 
which they are afflicted arise from physical defects due to faulty positions and want 
of appropriate exercise. Perhaps no class in the community have their physical 
characteristics more marked than the student class. The type may be distinguished 
by a drooping head, flat chest, hollow back, and constricted ribs just over thestom- 
ach. It is not necessary to look for the causes of these defects. They are faulty 
positions while studying, pressure of the desk against the body, the constriction of 
clothing during the growing period, the relaxed state of certain muscles, and the 
overstrained condition of others. 
Most occupations, including that of the student, tend to overuse the flexor muscles 
and to compress and constrict the body, thus lessening its internal capacity and inter- 
fering with the functions of important organs. Thus, the resistance of the clothing, 
weights lifted and borne on the back or shoulders, and even the use of heavy dumb- 
bells for health’s sake all tend to force the ribs downward and lessen the diameter 
of the thorax. To remedy this evil a system of artificial exercise is necessary. 
Just here we touch upon a principle that has escaped the attention of most teachers, 
If this deformity is brought about by the natural action of the muscles—that is, by 
their acting centripetally from their origin to their insertions—surely the remedy is 
to make them act centrifugally from their insertions to their origins. By grasping 
a bar or a pair of rings above the head, the parts where the muscles are inserted 
become fixed, and if the muscles contract, the parts from which they originated 
must move. 
In this case all the diameters of the thorax are increased and the chest capacity 
enlarged. In this principle lies the value of the rings, trapeze, ladders, parallel and 
horizontal bars, and, in fact, all of the climbing appurtenances, to those who are able’ 
tousethem. By the invention of the chest-expander, chest-developer, quarter circle, 
high pulleys, and inclined planes, traveling parallels, and similar apparatus, the 
same principle can be applied by anyone, however weak, and the same result can be 
accomplished. It requires a little more time, but the effect is likely to be more 
durable. 
By the use of the pulley-weight system resistance can be applied to any part of 
the body from any direction. In this peculiar property lies its great value asa 
means of enlarging the thoracic cavity and counteracting the cramping and con- 
stricting tendencies of modern occupations. 
I have dwelt upon these principles at some length because I have reason to believe
-P-A-G-E-582
      
554 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
they have not been well understood by persons interested in the subject. Some of 
the other theories that have guided me in formulating a system of exercises I shall 
state briefly in the form of a summary, together with those I have just mentioned, 
As far as I have been able to discover, they are based on sound physiological prin- 
ciples. ; 
(1) The person should be sufficiently interested in the exercise to give it his atten- 
tion in order to secure the necessary volitional power to start the movement. 
Whether the exercise is interesting in itself is a matter of little consequence. 
* (2) There should be a weight or resistance to overcome in order to bring out the 
working force of the musele. In using a weight the muscle gradually acquires the 
force with which it tries to contract. 
(3) Tho exercise must be performed with sufficient vigor and rapidity to engage 
the energetic contraction of the muscles employed. When this is done, old tissue is 
broken down and its place is supplied with new material in increased quantity, 
thus angmenting the size and strength of the muscles. The brain gains the power 
and energy which the exercise requires it to put forth. 
(4) Weak parts must first be strengthened, and then as many muscles as possible 
must be brought into action in order to secure a full-orbed and harmonious develop- 
ment ofthe whole body. One-sided development is usually attained by robbing 
some other part of its just share of the body’s nutriment. Most persons in their 
daily occupations use the flexor muscles more than the extensors, thereby cramping 
the vital organs and interfering with their functions. To remedy this tendency the 
muscles should be made to act from the center as far as possible in all forms of arti- 
ficial exercise. 
(5) A sufficient number of muscles should be called into action at one time to stim- 
ulate the action of the heart and lungs and increase the circulation and respiration. 
This is one of the most important considerations to bear in mind in regard to exer- 
cise. To keep up this increased respiratory activity and to aid the heart in remov- 
ing the waste material and hastening forward the new, the limbs and walls of the 
chest must be absolutely free from any ligatures or constrictions. The slightest 
interference with the action of the respiratory muscles at this time embarrasses the 
fanctions of the lungs and heart. This is the reason why loose clothing is 
always advised for exercise. 
(6) As a latent period precedes the contraction of a muscle, so a momentary period 
of rest should as far as possible precede movement in exercise. This is best secured 
where there is an alternation in the movements, as in walking, running, rowing, 
ete. All tetanized movements, such as holding weights, attitudinizing, standing or 
sitting in a constrained position, ete., tend to impair the tone of the muscles by 
interfering with the nutrition of both muscles and nerves. 
(7) The exercise of the young should be of such a composite nature as to bring 
about the co-operation and co-ordination of the muscles, This involves principally 
the training of the central nerve system. All gymnastic sports and athletic games 
that require skill, dexterity, coolness, courage, and presence of mind, are included 
in this list, and are exceedingly valuable to any system of physical training as 
adjuncts in the development of character. 
(8) All vital processes depend largely upon the maintenance of animal heat. But 
animal heat is now known to be generated in the blood while passing through the 
muscles, and not in the lungs, as was once supposed. The full contraction of the 
muscles greatly aids this function, and helps to force the warm blood through the 
tissues and back again to the heart. 
(9) In order to realize the best results from physical exercise and keep up the gen- 
eral nutrition of the body, all muscular effort should be followed by a bath or vigor- 
ous stroking and rubbing. 
(10) In every kind of physical exercise the qualities at first required are the qual- 
ities at length developed. Thus, if the exercise requires strength, strength will be

the result; if courage is exacted, courage will be the outcome; if quickness, quick- 
ness; and so through the whole range of faculties exercised. 
Knowing what is desired, it is an easy matter to prescribe the appropriate train- 
ARNG ees 
What America most needs is the happy combination which the European nations 
are trying to effect; the strength-giving qualities of the German gymnasium, the 
active and energetic properties of the English sports, the grace and suppleness 
aequired from the French calisthenics, and the beautiful poise and mechanical pre- 
cision of the Swedish free movements, all regulated, systematized, and adapted to 
our peculiar needs and institutions. 
The highest development of strength, activity, and grace is not compatible in the 
same individual, and consequently many persons prefer to sacrifice one in order to 
gain the other. But life’s forces are well adjusted and well balanced. 
  IV. THE DELSARTE SYSTEM. 
In investigating the so-called Delsarte system of physical training, 
one is met at the outset by the very formidable obstacle that the sys- 
tem has no authorized mouthpiece. The man whose name it bears never 
devised a system of physical training, and those that should be most 
familiar with his plans and purposes, and many of those who profess to 
have best mastered his philosophy repudiate the idea of connecting his 
name with any system of gymnastics. His own daughter, Madame 
Geraldy, is said to have declared, “It is the expression of the emotions 
through the body that my father taught. If one wishes to study 
gymnastics let him go to a gymnasium.” 
To make matters worse, there are apparently radical differences 
upon important points among even those who claim to represent Del- 
sartism and one no sooner imagines that he has a clue to the whole 
thing than a discouraging contradiction appears to throw him into 
worse confusion than before. 
There is, furthermore, a certain mysticism with which the Delsar- 
tians like to cover their work. They continually state that one can 
not hope to understand Delsarte. without deep study. 
What is presented herewith may not, therefore, correctly represent 
Delsarte physcal training in the opinion of some Delsartians, but the 
representative value of the extracts will not be questioned any more 
than it would have been if one of the Delsartians themselves had 
made the selection, if we may judge from the lack of harmony of opin- 
ion between them. 
BIOGRAPHY OF DELSARTE. . 
Frangois Delsarte was born November 11, 1811, at Solesme, France. His father, 
a physician, died, leaving his family poor. The young Delsarte was sent to Paris, 
in 1822, to study with a painter on china, but his tastes carried him into other chan- 
nels. He became, in 1825, a pupil of the conservatory, a Government institution for 
the instruction in dramatic art, music, and the ballet. Here, for want of proper 
guidance, he lost his voice. Finding himself thus incapacitated for the stage, he 
resigned that career for that of a teacher of singing and the dramatic art. Realiz- 
ing that he had been shipwrecked for want of a compass and a pilot, le determined

to save others from his fate by seeking and formulating the laws of an art hitherto 
left to the caprice of mediocrity, or the inspiration of genius. After years of unre- 
mitting labor,and study, study which took him by turns to hospitals, morgues, asylums, 
prisons, art galleries, etc., patiently unearthing the secrets and methods of past 
genius, study which kept him enchained by the hour watching the children at play 
in the great public gardens, weighing humanity everywhere and everyhow, he suc- 
ceeded in discovering and formulating the laws of wsthetic science. Thanks to 
him, that science has now the same precision as that of mathematics. He died, 
without arranging his life-work for publication, July 20,1871. Many are the names 
famous in their different careers, that have owed much to his instruction: Rachel, 
Sontag, Pasca, Monsabre, etc.'—[Ascribed to the Abbe Delaumosne in Mrs. Steb- 
bins’s Delsarte System of Dramatic Expression. 
THE WHOLE THING IN A NUTSHELL. 
I willgive you in a very simple, very compact form, a complete definition of what 
the Delsarte system is of which so much talk is made, usually consisting, however, in 
hollow echoes. The Delsarte system is a careful analysis of the facts of human 
nature and experience, generalized into laws which dominate those facts and applied 
in a system of practical rules for the perfecting of the human instrument physically 
and spiritually, so that our experience may be raised to the highest possible degree 
of variety, fullness, and harmony. That is the Delsarte system.—[Rev. William R. 
Alger, before the Convention of Elocutionists, Chicago, 1893. 
  A LESS CONCISE, BUT MORE SATISFACTORY DESCRIPTION. 
There are two widely differing conceptions of Delsartism. One is Delsarte’s own, 
of a method of training for vocal and pantomimic expression, founded neither on 
tradition, empiricism, inspiration, nor good luck, but on a reverent study of nature’s 
laws. The other is the popular misconception of the man and his mission as a sort 
of inspired gymnast, the end and aim of whose life was to enable silly girls to atti- 
tudinize in public and private, to move in strange and weird curves and spirals, and 
to wear costumes more or less suggestive of the apparitions in materializing seance. 
The prevalence of exhibitions of statue-posing, Greek dances, emotive gestures, tab- 
Jeaux vivants, fan drills, broomstick drills, fainting, dying, and grand and lofty 
tumbling, dignified by the name of Delsarte, and too often given by people who have 
never mastered cven the elements of harmonic poise is responsible for the popular 
notion of the master whom we reverence. 
It is the misfortune, in one sense, of Delsartism that its possibilities in training 
for physical perfection have been exemplified, in this country at least, much more 
fully than the expressive side of the work. * * * Thegymnastic side, important 
and interesting as it is, has come to. be regarded as the be-all and end-all of the sys- 
tem; whereas Delsarte himself attached very little importance toit. Nevertheless, 
it can not be denied that the results of following out these principles of physical 
training, whether they originated with Delsarte, or, as is sometimes claimed, with 
Mackaye, have far surpassed those of any other system of gymnastics in grace, free- 
dom, and harmonious cooperation of all the parts of the body. 
The essential principle upon which they are based may, I think, be summed up in 
some such formula as this: In any true system of physical training, muscular devel- 
opment must be proportioned to the supply of vital energy in the individual. Or, 
in the langage of Delsarte, the psychic must transcend the pBaystes al. The ieligey 
Mr. Games Steele Mackaye first brought eigen Peomnentie pares the ae 
can public in 1869. Mr. Mackaye had studied under Delsarte, in Paris, and returned 
to this country to prepare the way for the coming of his master. Delsarte, however, 
was prevented from coming to America by the Franco-Prussian war.
-P-A-G-E-585
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 557 
of all-other gymnastic systems with which the writer is acquainted is that they 
measure results by external growth. Even the tabulati s of specialists of the 
school of Sargent, of Harvard, are devoted mainly to recoraing differences in size; 
and their aim seems to be to remodel the external physical shell in accordance with 
certain hard and fast notions of manly and womanly beauty. While muscle is val- 
uable, it should never be forgotten that mere mass is useless without energy, and 
that a smallarm with a tremendous reservoir of reserve force behind it will win the 
battle every time against a muscular development, however great, that has been 
gained at the expense of latent power in the brain. 
While Delsarte was probably quite unconséious of the tendency of his teachings 
in this direction, there is no doubt that this view of the relative value of nerve and 
muscle has been splendidly reinforced by arguments derived from his theories, and 
is upheld most forcibly to-day by adherents of the so-called Delsarte system of 
physical culture. 
To harmonize mind and body; to put the soul back in the whole body; to main- 
tain equilibrium of all the functions and principles of being; to render the body 
plastic; to free all the channels of expression; to remove constrictions that inter- 
fere with the flow of emotion to all the parts—this, we were taught again and again, 
in varying formulas, but with one thought behind the formulas, is the object of har- 
monic gymnastics. In more accurate language, we could say: To preserve the just 
proportion between nerve-force and muscle. The physical problem of the future is 
not how to cultivate muscle, but how to conserve and increase vital energy. Del- 
sartism has helped on the discussion of the problem by example and precept. If it 
has not furnished a solution, it has at least vehemently asserted the substantial 
unity of soul and body, and paved the way to a recognition of the undeniable fact 
that, without in-forming energy, mere physical development is a useless burden to 
the soul.—[Mr. F. Townsend Southwick, in Werner’s Magazine, June, 1893. 
  FLEXIBILITY, POISE, AND STRENGTH, THE END OF PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
I can hardly outline what I consider to be the system of Delsarte, because he woula 
not have claimed that he left asystem. - It isnotascience. It has not been reduced 
toascience. It is still in a transition condition. Not more than two or three of 
the so-called laws of Delsarte can be called final laws. Most of them are unfinished 
rules of expression. But his laws of development, as I understand them, are, first, 
the training of the body as an instrument of expression; second, the study of the 
elements of expression; and, third, the application of the principles to the more 
involved emotional work. : 
With the latter we have nothing to do at present, but I wish to try to explain 
whatI understand to be the system, as far as it has been developed, in physical train- 
ing. 
The first thing is the cultivation of the physical sensibilities of a pleasure in what 
we are doing, and with that a cultivation of the various senses. But without an 
inspiring motive, without some emotion accompanying every act, itseems tome that 
the physical movement is simply adead thing, like a body without a soul. Herein 
lies the danger of reducing it to a mere mechanism. 
The principles of Delsarte, the laws, I will pass over and come ‘down to the more 
tangible work in hand. The first step that Delsarte would undertake with a pupil 
would be the correction of any mannerisms that he might find. The correction of 
these mannerisms might be the relaxing of a muscle, if it is very tense, or the 
strengthening it, if it be over relaxed. The exercises that Delsarte used seem to be 
derived directly from the common practices that we see in everyday life, the action’ 
of the child, the movements of the people in the ordinary healthy state. The first 
step toward a definite system, I do not think, lies in the principle of relaxation, 
Before we can relax any part of the body we must necessarily have power to control 
our body in an equilibrium or balanced state. Therefore the first step toward a
-P-A-G-E-586
  558 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
thorough system would be the practice of poise, the resting of the body in its move- 
ments in different directions, retaining all parts properly balanced about a common 
-center. 
In that matter of poise, to illustrate the absolute necessity of accompanying emo- 
tion with movement, I believe itis not right nor proper to practice a swaying of 
the body in any direction without accompanying it with some intention of thought 
or of feeling. The general sway or poise of the body, Delsarte taught, should be 
taken first of all with the intention of acquiring a sensation of comfort, of pleasure 
And, second, an intention, as a matter of thought, of reasoning, a desire to accom- 
plish something. Physical exercise ought to be resolved at once into a definite 
expression, a definite attitude or gesture. That is what it is for, not for the sake of 
developing a certain amount of strength; but it is for the sake of emotional expres- 
sion. The use of a dramatic speech or situation or intention should be involved in 
the physical movement. * * = * 
I do not think itright to practice a relaxing movement, i. e., the surrendering of 
any part to gravity, like the state that it has in sleep; I do not believe it is right to 
cultivate that condition of the muscular system without using it at once emotion- 
ally. When a child on the street sways its arms and makes other spontaneous move- 
ments, it is doing exactly what I understand Delsarte’s intention to be in relaxing 
movements, abandoning itself to spontaneity of gesture. I would take every relax- 
jng movement and resolve it into some gesture, giving all its value, and not makeit 
merely a mechanical thing. The same with controlling movements. I understand. 
relaxing movements to be surrendering the part to gravity, but of controlling all the 
other parts and relieving them. We are not only relieving one part, but strengthen- 
ing another. 
Beyond the matter of poising, relaxing, and controlling, I think we ought to 
approach nearer to expression by practicing involution and evolution of movements; 
we ought to come nearer to the actual expression of daily life, the bringing in the 
movement in sensitive impression, and the carrying out of movement in forcible 
expression. These transitions of movement bring us still a step further into some- 
thing like pantomimic work. The use of the swaying of different parts of the body, 
taken by themselves, may be in different forms, but always with the intention to 
resolve them into positive attitude, gesture, or expression of some kind. The oppo- 
sition of movements, of course, is a very simple thing, and I need not delay upon it. 
It is a matter of balance, belonging to the law of consistency, that when one part 
is in use the other part may not be used. The use of any part without the use of 
another part is contrary to nature, and will result in anunequaldevelopment. Itis 
not right to practice one muscle by itself without the cooperative use of the rest of 
the muscular system. The recognition of the laws of Delsarte, or the relation 
between the center and the extremities, the necessity of repose being back of every 
activity, thelaw of motion which is absolutely final, the whole matter of magnetism, 
the law of expression, all these need to be understood and applied in purely physical 
training. 
Perhaps I may draw the line there and say, beyond that we go into emotional 
expression, which is beyond the function of the physical trainer. The use of the 
voice and the practice of the voice is certainly a part of physical training, as much 
as the exercise of the general body. 
Asaresumé, I would say that, as I understand it, the ultimate matter is reached in 
physical work when we have attained perfect flexibility, poise, and strength, all 
equally important. Repose is obtained by relaxation. Energy is the part of physical 
work which is usually taken care of so much by itself. In making a plea here I 
might go further and deeper, but the time is short. But, as I understand it, finally, 
the whole object of physical training is to enlarge the scope of our powers, and its 
principal object is to develop the body as a means of emotional expression.—[Mr. 
Franklin H. Sargent before the American Association for the Advancement of 
Physical Education, meeting of 1892.

PHYSICAL TRAINING. 559 
THE CHARACTER OF THE 
  CISES. 
The outline of the systematic physical culture which I shall bring before you is 
composed of three widely different elements, all in conformity with the basic idea of 
Delsarte: (1) The so-called aesthetic gymnastics of Delsarte’s training; (2) the Swedish 
or Ling system; (3) the ceremonial forms of Oriental prayer. These, when prop- 
erly combined and graded into systematic progressive exercises, constitute a perfect 
system of gymnastics which brings into being and activo use each of the three 
great principles of Frangois Delsarte. We have sequence, opposition, and corre- 
spondence; consequently, we have all the elements essential to.evolve beauty of form, 
graceful motion, and artistic presentation. As will be seen, such a system embraces 
both physical and aesthetic culture. I shall confine myself now to the purely 
physical aspect. 5 
Ihave never searched consciously for trinities; they have turned up of themselves 
in almost every department of my studies. Inmy case, I think I may say, that is a 
way that trinities have. For instance, in physical culture, perfection consists of a 
judicious blending of relaxation, energizing, and deep breathing. 
Relaxation too often has been mistaken for inertia. This is a false conception, 
and has given rise, in those who do not comprehend its real nature, to the habit of 
doing things in a semi-lifeless, easy way. Relaxation does not mean acting in a 
relaxed, lazy manner. It means rest after effort, perfect rest after perfect effort. It 
implies more than this, for it means tho conscious transfer of energy from one depart- 
inent of nature to another, with unaffected ease and grace, after an active tension 
of body or of brain. True relaxation would mean the resigning of the body to the 
law of gravity, of the mind to nature, and of the entire energy to a deep, rhythmic 
breathing. Complete relaxation of the voluntary muscles at once transfers the 
energy to the involuntary parts, so that, strictly speaking, thero can be no such 
thing as conscious relaxation, except.in the voluntary muscles and the brain. But 
this is quite sufficient. This transfer of energy produces the requisite equilibrium 
for the renewing of physical strength. 
It will, therefore, be seen that the vital principal of relaxation, with the use and 
processes connected therewith, has been misunderstood by,a majority of those who 
profess to follow the Delsarte system. Nothing can be further from the truth than 
to imagine that Delsarte’s idea of training was to produce a state of devitalized 
action. It was the very reverse. Delsarte, having the instinctive perception of a 
true artist, must have known perfectly well! that to free the channels of expression 
so that the whole form should respond to the image in the mind, nothing was more 
valuable t> commence with than the decomposing exercises which enable the 
trained individual to rest at will. Remember, then, that relaxation means the abil- 
ity to rest, and, in resting, to recuperate dynamic power through repose. In all 
truly graceful action there must be an expressed consciousness of force in reserve 
and not an evidence of devitalized easiness. * * * 
The second principle of our system is energizing. It is based upon the well-known 
physiological law that use and friction of the parts attract thereto a flow of blood 
and nerve force. Action means waste, and this waste calls for fresh supplies of 
molecular energy to renew the cellular tissue. Growth and an increase of muscular 
strength is the natural result when the energy supplied is fully equal to the demand. 
The amount of energy is determined by the dynamic capacity of the brain and 
lungs; and this, in the system under notice, is obtained from the oxygen stored 
through the rhythmic breathing which accompanies each particular movement. 
To energize the parts so as to obtain the greatest possible benefit from the amount 
  
‘Whether it can be proved that he taught the decomposing exercises or not, the 
fact remains that, as he certainly did teach to his pupils the spiral motion of the 
arms, he must have taught relaxation in some form, as decomposing exercises are 
absolutely necessary as a training for spiral motion.
-P-A-G-E-588
  Doss: EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
of energy expended there should be a slow increase of muscular tension as the mind 
directs the flow of nerve force to the parts and an equally slow relaxation. Noth- 
jng increases the nervo-magnetic power of the physique more than this method of 
energizing. Then comes the energizing series of gymnastic exercises which brings 
each muscle of the body into play in its turn. Much discretion, however, is necessary 
in such work. Different temperaments require slightly different treatment. Many 
individuals are physically out of proportion, and, therefore, need special exercises 
and direction for developing the weak or immature parts. * * * 
Every Delsartian should possess a sound knowledge of physiology and the phys- , 
iological effects of different forms of motion. With such knowledge there is not the 
slightest difficulty in translating the angular motions of the Swedish system into 
those which develop grace equally with physical strength. Iam a firm supporter of 
brawn and muscle; but, at the same time, I insist that the same physiological effects 
and consequent physical development can be obtained in a system which evolves 
grace and beauty as in a system which produces an angular, jerky, inartistic pre- 
sentation. A beautiful physique, with graceful strength in every action, is the Del- 
sartian ideal. 
The third element in physical culture is breathing. To breathe, one would think, 
is one of the most natural things in the world. So it is, inaway. But to breathe 
correctly, healthfully, in other words, to breathe hygienically, is just as much of an 
art as is anything else in human nature, and requires long practice and careful train- 
ing. What is more natural than to talk? And yet how many people do you meet in 
any one day who speak correctly or who express their thoughts in a pleasing tone 
and a natural manner? Speaking correctly is a matter of grammar and accent, but 
speaking in a clear tone, with a sweet voice, is largely a matter of proper respiration. 
In physical culture, then, breathing occupies a most important place. It is the 
basis of mental life and physical activity. It is the grand foundation pivot, around 
which every other form of culture must reyolye.—[Genevieve Stebbins, in Werner's 
Magazine, January, 1894. 
GYMNASIUMS FOR CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The use of apparatus is not essential to an effective system of physi- 
eal training, and the lack of funds to equip a gymnasium is no reason 
for a refusal to begin systematic work in that line. But whatever may 
be done between the desks in the schoolroom must be regarded simply 
as a makeshift to serve only in the absence of a regular place for exer- 
cising, and none will deny that the work may be prosecuted to still bet- 
ter effect when a sufficient supply of gymnastic appliances is provided. 
This is especially true of schools for older pupils, for their interest is 
more easily enlisted in apparatus work than in the free exercises. 
There is another consideration that seems to be even more weighty 
than any of those usually urged in favor of the use of apparatus. The 
free exercises depend for their effectiveness largely upon the action of the 
antagonistic muscles. Now, if there is such a thing as muscular train- 
ing, and if physical power is an object to be desired, it would seem 
that the muscles should not be deliberately trained to act in opposi- 
tion and therefore to interfere with the movements of each other, even 
if the appearance of strength is the result. The required resistance 
to the muscular movement should come from external objects rather
-P-A-G-E-589
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 561 
than from antagonistic muscles. Of course not all free exercises are 
subject to this objection, nor is it necessarily fatal even where it does 
apply, for other exercises tend to counteract these ill effects; but the 
tendency is bad and the theory is worse. 
Free gymnastics usually come first when physical training is begun — 
in city school systems; light hand apparatus is next, and the fully 
equipped gymnasium is the last step in the introduction of a well-devel- 
oped system of gymnastics. A number of cities are now ready for the 
second and third stages of development in this order, and information 
concerning the apparatus ordinarily used in this country can not be 
amiss. In securing this information the aid of the manufacturers of 
such apparatus was sought. Letters were written to the Narragansett 
Machine Company, Providence, R. I.; John Gloy, Chicago, Ill.; Fred. 
Medart, St. Louis, Mo.; A. G. Spalding & Bros., Philadelphia, Pa., 
and to the Schumacker Gymnasium Company, Akron, Ohio, These 
gentlemen were asked for information concerning (1) the building of 
new school gymnasiums; (2) the conversion of halls, attics, basements, 
etc., into gymnasiums; (3) the apparatus required and its uses; (4) the 
improvements made in the same by their respective firms, and (5) the 
cost. All of them responded fully and satisfactorily. There was nec- 
essarily a great similarity in their answers, and all minutely described 
the mechanical improvements in their own wares. The writer is con- 
vinced that the American manufacturers. excel all others in the finish 
and in the mechanical excellence of their apparatus, but they have 
made but few changes that affect the essential character of the appara- 
tus or the exercises to be performed. The following pages contain as 
many of the facts of general interest brought out by the replies men- 
tioned as can-be conveniently published. Repetitions and references 
to purely mechanical improvements have been omitted as far as possi- 
ble. 
FROM THE NARRAGANSETT MACHINE COMPANY, PROVIDENCE, R. I. 
{Prepared by Wm. L. Coop, Providence, R. I., assisted by Miss Ellen Le Garde, superintendent of 
physical training in the Providence publie schools.] 
A school gymnasium when best placed is ina separate building, which might be 
situated in the rear of the school buildings or in the center of a quadrangle formed 
by them and connected with the schoolhouses by passages. The edifice could then 
be constructed specially for gymnasium work and should be from 18 to 22 feet in 
height, the collar beams of the trusses supporting the roof. It could be rectangular 
in form, with sides in a proportion of 2 by 3 or thereabouts. Ifthe room is less than 
50 feet wide allowance should be made for at least 40 square feet of floor space for 
each scholar exercising. 
If a separate building can not be had the next best situation is in the upper part 
of the school building. In many cases the peak of the roof can be utilized. If pos- 
sible, a clear height of 18 feet should be secured af the center of the room for such 
suspended apparatus as traveling rings, flying rings, climbing. ropes, ete. The side 
walls need not be over 6 feet high. Lightcan be obtained from dormer windows or | 
from thick ground glass set in the roof. The floor of such a gymnasium should be

suspended entirely separate frum the ceiling and partitions of the rooms below: Tie~ 
rods from the trusses can be used for this purpose, although they are somewhat of 
an obstruction in the gymnasium room, and should not be put in if the floor could be 
otherwise supported without great expense. The best possible means of deadening 
the floor, to prevent sound, should be employed, and, in any case, such a gymnasium 
can not be used for heavy jumping or fast running without the resulting noise dis- 
turbing the schoolroom below when in session. The position, however, is prefer- 
able to any other in the building, on account of light and ventilation and the oppor- 
tunity to secure the necessary height without great expense. 
Gymnasiums may be placed in a basement. If, however, the room can not be 16 
feet or more high the traveling rings would not be of much use and climbing appa- 
ratus would also be limited in its value. Some form of ventilation that would be sure 
to thoroughly change the air of the room after each class had exercised should also 
be adopted. Care should be taken to drain under the floor thoroughly, that the floor 
may be absolutely dry. It should also be ventilated underneath to prevent dry rot 
of the floortimbers. Any swinging apparatus that is attached to the ceiling should 
be insulated or provided with roller bearings to prevent noise. School audience 
halls could often be used to advantage for a wide range of gymnasiuw work without 
any of the apparatus at all interfering with other uses of the hall other than the 
temporary removal of seats. On the side walls could be placed pully weights and 
racks for calisthenic apparatus. If suspended apparatus is demanded it could be 
so arranged as to be quickly hoisted out of the way. If the floor of the hallis not 
specially constructed to avoid the transmission of sound to the rooms below, such 
exercises as jumping, running, or stamping will necessarily haye to be avoided while 
these rooms are being used. Whero liberal halls (passageways) are provided in 
school buildings these may be used for gymnasium work. Racks for Indian clubs, 
dumb-bells, bar bells, poles, wands, hoops, fencing sticks, etc., can be secured to the 
walls, and even pulley weights can be placed to good advantage for class purposes. 
In a hall 20 feet wide and 50 feet long 25 or 30 children can exercise at one time in 
the majority of calisthenic movements, and a sufficient number of pulley weights 
can be arranged for all to take one-hand exercise in class. Low-studded rooms of 
from 10 to 12 feet may be used for all gymnasium work, except such as is done on 
apparatus suspended from or attached to the ceiling. 
Gymnastic exercises may be performed in the aisles between the desks of the ordi- 
nary schoolroom, and in many of the movements the desks themselves can be util- 
ized as a means of support. A device has been invented that can be secured to the 
ends of opposite desks forming a substitute fora parallel bar.. Racks for calisthenic 
apparatus can easily be attached to the walls of the schoolroom under the windows 
and in such places as are not occupied by blackboards. This latter plan permits a 
ready arrangement of the pupils with apparatus in hand to rise from the seats to 
earry out any series of gymnastic movements. 
Out-of-door, or school yard, gymnasiums.—City schools, except those in the largest 
cities, have generally sufficient yard room to use for gymnasium exercises. In fact, 
if there is any yard room it can be used to advantage. Games that possess gym- 
nastie features can be taught to classes of 60 pupils, or when such classes are too 
large for all to play in one game they can be divided in squads of 10 or 15, and all 
exercise inthe samemanner. Suitable games are being devised by gymnasium direct- 
ors and published in gymnastic books now being issued. The children should be 
encouraged to play these games outside of the school yard, asa great advantage will 
be derived from the practice of them by the children and the substitution of games 
that have gymnastic value for those not so beneficial. Many of the games can be 
played without apparatus, but-the addition of apparatus adds to the interest of the 
game, Rubber balls to be thrown and caught, barriers to be leaped over, objects to 
~ be collected or distributed, and other implements that develop skill and agility_are 
desirable. An almost ideal game is very popular at present among gymnasts in the

Young Men’s Christian Associations, which is well adapted for outdoor use. It is 
called basket ball, and was devised by-Mr. James Naismith, one of the teachers of the 
Young Men’s Christian Association training school, Springfield, Mass. The imple- 
ments for the game consist of a large rubber or leather ball similar to a football and 
two baskets, or rings, that can be suspended at about 10 feet from the ground. 
The pupils are formed in two divisions, the object of each division being to throw 
the ball into the goal of the opposite division, or prevent the opposite division from 
throwing the ball into theirs. The ball must not be carried or kicked, but must be 
thrown, and rough playing is prohibited. The game can be played by any number 
from 10 to 100. It calls for great skill and aetivity, brings into action all the players, 
and the chances of accident are very small. Systematized gymnastics can be car- 
ried on in the school yard. The calisthenic apparatus used in the schoolroom can 
with benefit be used outdoors when the temperature and weather permit. Such 
apparatus as ladders, ropes, poles for climbing, seesaw, giant stride, stilts, balanc- 
ing beam, vaulting bars, etc., can be arranged to stand. exposure to weather and 
adapted for outdoor use. In primary schools covered sand gardens could be pro- 
vided. Such school-yard gymnasia should be open to the public during the summer 
months of school vacation, under a director. The opportunity for exercise and play 
in crowded localities would prevent a tendency to petty offenses, crimes, etc.; a 
place of innocent enjoyment would be afforded,and if kept open and lighted by 
electricity, would afford places of exercises, recreation, and rest for laboring men. 
The only cost entailed would be that of lighting and the salary of a care-taker, who 
should be invested with police rights of arrest, etc. These outdoor gymnasiums are 
provided for by law in all German cities of over 15,000 inhabitants, and the inhab- 
itants are taxed to maintain them. One large central one in the larger cities is used 
not only for school purposes, but to train instructors. Such a public school outdoor 
gymnasium was established in Sandusky, Ohio, in May, 1892, under Hans Ballin, 
director of gymnastic work in the public schools. 
School gymnasium outfits.—A simple outfit of apparatus should be selected at first, 
and if additions are made they can be selected by the director to conform to the 
course of training adopted. 
The following two plans and lists are selected and arranged for a class of not over 
60. In calisthenic exercises there is sufficient apparatus provided for each pupil, 
and exercises on chest weights may be performed with one hand only by the entire 
class. On the ladders, bars, etc., the class will be divided into four squads. The - 
ladders may be hoisted out of the way and the vaulting bars and posts removed 
when the entire floor is needed. The uprights of the vaulting bars hold the cord or 
sticks for jumping and the vaulting bars sustain the free end of the adjustible lad- 
ders. Thus, by a judicious arrangement, the same piece of apparatus is made to serve 
a double use at the same cost. 
In the high-school lists two varieties of special pulley weights are introduced 
(intercostal and back and loin machines) with a view to individual corrective work, 
With these outfits the exercises may be progressive in either gymnasium or in 
passing from one to the other, thus holding the interest of the pupils. 
The general arrangement of the apparatus in the exact order indicated is not 
necessary, except as noted above, but it should be so arranged as not to interfere 
when in use and to require as little moving as possible. A description of the appara- 
tus in detail is given on the following pages:

DETAILED DESCRIPTION. 
This description applies to the apparatus made by the Narragansett Machine Com- 
pany, of Providence, R. I., who make Sargent gymnastic apparatus under the per- 
sonal direction of Dr. D. A. Sargent, of Harvard College, Cambridge, Mass. ; German 
apparatus under the supervision of C. F. E. Schulz, of Baltimore, Md., a graduate of 
the Turners’ Seminary, and Swedish apparatus under the direction of Mr. Nils Posse, 
a graduate of the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. 
Calisthenic apparatus.—Light apparatus adds to the interest in gymnastic exercises 
and increases its value. 
Apparatus made for toys is generally worthless for gymnasium use, competition 
having reduced it in price and quality to that point where it is neither properly 
made nor of such material as to be durable. All calis- 
thenie apparatus made of wood should be finished 
with shell-lac varnish, and all turned work should 
be polished in the lathe. Cheaper varnishes, put on 
. with a brush, do not give so smooth a surface and 
when heated by the hands when in use becomes 
sticky. In all cases racks or some means of caring 
for apparatus when it-is not in use should be pro- 
vided and placed so that classes can easily take and 
replace the pieces they need while marching by in 
orderly manner. 
Apparatus for lifting, thrusting, dnd swinging.—This 
is usually the first used, and light weights should be 
selected for beginuers. 
Dumb-bells are generally made of maple, and should 
weigh from one-half to 1 pound each. The handle 
should be large enough to fill the hand of the pupil 
using them and should not have any groove at the 
end near the bell, as is often found in those sold in 
the toy stores. Good dumb-bells of the above weights 
cost from 25 to 35 cents per pair. Irom racks of the  F!¢. 1.—Dumb-bell and hook. 
form shown ‘in fig. 1 are best adapted for holding the dumb-bells. The cost of 
these is 15 cents per pair with screws, 
Musical dumb-bells, invented by Miss Elen Le Garde, euperinteitenn of physical 
education in the Providence public schools, isan admirable form for children. As will 
be seen by fig. 2, it consists of two pairs of bells connected by a handle. Each pair of 
    Fig. 2.—Musical dumb-bell. 
bells is arranged to hold a clapper or ‘‘ sounder,” which does not ring the bells 
until they are forcibly turned or shaken. The bells have a clear, sweet tone, are 
inade of highly polished steel durably nickel plated, and have a polished hard-wood 
handle. 3 
The peculiar value of the musical bell lies in the necessity for sharp, energetic 
action at the end of each movement to produce the sound, which everyone using 
       
-P-A-G-E-594
566 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
3a them will want to get, thus forcibly exercising the muscles brought into action. 
- . Any of the familiar dumb-bell drills can be readily adapted to the musical bell. 
The ordinary child takes kindly to anything that makes a noise, and 
when this noise resolves itself into harmonious sounds his delight is 
manifest in face, voice, or act. Drills with this form of bell are 
learned quickly by children because they like them. . They are doing 
something, and are doing it with a noise. The bells are packed in 
strong boxes, which can be kept in the school desks and laid open 
on the desk when ready for the ‘dumb-bell drill. They cost 45 cents 
per pair in lots of a dozen. 
Indian clubs are made of maple or white wood, the latter being 
the lightest and best for the purpose. They should be finished the 
same as dumb-bells, and a similar rack is made for holding them. 
The school-model Indian club (fig. 3) is specially designed for 
children’s use from 8 to 12 years. It weighs about three-fourths 
of a pound, and they cost 45 cents per pair. Maple Indian clubs 
weighing from three-fourths to 14 pounds can be had from 27 cents 
per pair upward, according to the weight. Heavier clubs than 
1} pounds are never used in schools. Indian clubs can not be used 
in the schoolroom with desks. ~ 
Jump ropes may be obtained in all the toy stores for10 cents and 
upward. Jumping with the rope can ene be done in pymnasbans

Apparatus held by both hands adds an interesting variety of gymnastic work and 
places in opposition many sets of muscles, as in pulling the Spoesite sides of rings 
or pressing on the ends of a wand. 
Wands are usually made of maple or any hard wood. They should be finished 
with shell-lac varnish and be rubbed down until they aresmooth. The size in most 
common use is three-fourths of an inch diameter and 44 feetlong. These cost $2.25.

each wand, or in bundles horizontally, as is shown in fig. 4. Wands can be used in 
- schoolroom with desks and to the best advantage. They are light and easier to 
manage by young children than any other piece of school apparatus. ‘They lead the 
way and educate young pupils to higher forms. 
Bar bells are a combination of a wand and a dumb-bell, or a dumb-bell with an 
elongated handle, the balls on the ends giving more momentum to the bar bell in 
the movements performed. The size commonly used is 4 feet 8 inches long and the 
cost $3.75 per dozen. Short bar bells may be used between the desks in the school- 
room for a few of the common movements. 
Hoops, such as are usaally sold in the toy stores, may, by being w pant with ciate

  be made to answer for hoop exercises, but hoops specially made for-the purpose, of 
selected material, finished with shell-lac, are much better. Such hoops are made in 
sizes of 24, 30, and 86 inches in diameter. These vary inprice from $1.50 to $1.87 
per dozen. They are easily hung on a large pin, a dozen or so on each pin. 
Apparatus, connecting or placing pupils in opposition, aids in 
acquiring better rythm, and by varying the direction in which 
resistance is offered, develops more fully the muscular system. 
Rings, as used in calisthenic exercises (Fig. 6) are made of maple, 
the best being made of two or more pieces glued together, with 
the grain in opposite directions. They can be finished the same 
as Indian clubs and dumb-bells, and may be held on a large pin = 
the same as those used for hoops. The size usually used are Fic. G.—Ring. 
4} and 5 inches, inside diameter, and cost 37 cents and 45 cents per pair when glued 
up, and 30 cents and 34 cents per pair when turned from solid wood. 
Poles are made from any strong, straight-grained wood, finished the same as other 
ealisthenic apparatus and cut in lengths of 8, 10, or 12 feet, costing 30, 37, and 45 
cents each, respectively. They may be kept in a rack similar to that used for the 
wands. : 
Wands and bar-bells may be used at times in exercises similar to those arranged 
. for poles and rings, each pupil holding to opposite ends of the bar-bells or wands, 
as they do the opposite side of the rings. 
Drill apparatus.—Apparatus for executing gymnastic movements similar to those 
used in military drill always possesses a certain fascination for children.

      The first in this class is the foil designed by Dr. Anderson. It is made entirely 
of wood, the blade being straight hickory, capable of standing a good blow, and = 
fixed in the handle so that it can be easily removed. The 
moyements recommended for this foil are similar to 
those in broadsword exercises, but not so energetic. 
They cost 45 cents per pair and may be held in similar 
racks to those for dumb-bells. 
The drill gun (Fig. 7) is made according to designs 
furnished by Dr. Anderson and is of soft or hard wooed, 
as may be desired. The cost is 30 cents each in soft 
wood, and 37 cents in hard wood. ‘They are finished in 
shell-lac, with a black barrel, and may be held in racks 
that hold them vertically in lots of a dozen. - 
Pulley weights are the best means of exercise for the 
direct application of exercise to the muscular system in 
definite directions. 
  This form is the most generally used of any single 
class of apparatus in college gymnasiums for prescrip- 
tion exercise or such as are selected by the director for 
the correction of any physical defects. Some of them 
are also largely used in class exercise, particularly what 
is known as the chest weight. These machines were 
first popularized-by Dr. D. A. Sargent in American col- Fi. 8.—Champion chest weight. 
lege gymnasiums, and have since heen adopted by the young men’s Christian asso- 
ciations and athletic clubs in addition to the educational institutions of all grades.

Three types are generally adapted to school gymnasiums, i: e., chest weights. inter- 
costal, and back and loin machines. These are illustrated by the accompanying 
engravings. 
The chest weight, which consists of a pair of weights provided with pulleys at 
about the height of the operators’ shoulders, and handles connected with ropes~ 
arranged to lift the weights, should be found in every school building. 
The champion chest weight, shown in Fig. 8, has been designed specially for

schooluse. Itis simple in construction, with no loose parts, except the weights, and 
is well adapted for use where a machine is to stand rough and careless usage. 
Other forms of pulley-weight machines are the intercostal chest weight (Fig. 9) 
and the back and loin machine (Fig. 10). 
Various attachments may be made to these machines, such as a rowing attachment 
to a back and loin machine, paddleand neck attachments to chest weights, etc. 
Heavy apparatus is such as enables the user to lift, swing, or otherwise handle his 
‘own weight. 
Apparatus for suspension.—F lying rings consist of two rings suspended about 18 
inches apart, in such a manner that that the height of suspension may be adjusted. 
   
-P-A-G-E-597
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
The form shown at Fig. 11 is adjustable by means of a chain on the sid 
or by a strap connecting the rings with ropes. Both means of adjustment are not 
necessary in one piece of apparatus, and the latter is the one most commonly used on

account of its being more economical. Rings should be quite large, 7 or 8 inches in 
diameter, and covered with leather, The adjustable strapsshould be of webbing,.as 
leather is liable to become dry and break without warning. The price of flying rings

570 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
with strap adjustment is $9; with rope and chain adjustment, $18.. Exercises on this 
piece of apparatus will be found in the Puritz Code Book of Gynmastic Exercise. ~ 
Traveling rings, or row of rings as they are somtimes called, consist of a line of 
rings with ropes attached to points of suspension 16 feet or more from the floor 
(Fig. 12). The distance apart of the rings depends on the height of the point of sus- 
pension from the floor, and should be for average use, as follows:

Forawoman’s gymnasium the distance should be less. For an athletic club, greater. 
The rings should be leather covered and will cost complete with ropes, hooks, etc., 
about $4 each. 
Ladders are infinite in variety, but the form illustrated herewith (Fig. 13) is well 
adapted for school work. For class exercises one ladder should be provided for every

PHYSICAL TRAINING. 571 
12 or 15 pupils. - This form of ladder may be set horizontal or inclined, as shown in 
the illustration. The outer end may be set on the rounds of the stand so that the 
shorter pupils can easily reach its rounds, or the outer end may rest on the floor and 
be inclined as desired, so that the ladder may be adopted eitber for suspension from 
its under side or balancing movements by walking up the rounds on the outside, or 
itinay be hoisted up entirely out of the way, a desirable feature in gymnasiums. 
Climbing apparatus is specially desirable in school gymnasiums. Climbing ropes

are made of four-strand selected manila, generally finished with a large leather- 
covered Turk’s head on the lower end, although this adds considerable to the expense. 
They may be smooth or have braided rings or wooden balls secured about 8 inches 
apart. The plain form is most commonly used. Plain climbing ropes, with knot, 18 
feet long, cost $5.62; without the leather knot, $3.75. 
Climbing poles are an economical form of apparatus. They should be made of 
tough, well-seasoned wood, and finished smooth and free from splinters. A pole 18

feet long, with proper fixtures, will cost $3. All climbing apparatus may be arranged 
to swing up out of the way when the room is desired for other purposes. 
Apparatus for leaping and vaulting can be used to its full advantage only on the 
ground floor. However, with the aid of mattresses, the jar of leaping or jumping 
may be so far absorbed as to be of little annoyance in other rooms. 
Jump stands: Fig. 15 represents upright poles with holes bored one inch apart to 
sustain a cord having weights on the ends, or a straight stick to gauge the height of 
the jump. These may be used in connection with flying rings to obtain a swing and 
jump, or with climbing ropes. A stand 6 feet high anl low enough for indoor gymna- 
sium use costs $5.25, with cord and bags, The uprights of vaulting bars may also be 
used to hold the cord or stick for jumping, thus saving the cost of jump stands. 
Vaulting bars: This piece of appara- 
tus (Fig. 16) is desirable for advanced 
gymnastic work. The variety of exer- 
cises that may be performed on it is 
infinite, although the name'given to it 
would indicate that its purpose was for 
vaulting or leaping over with the assist- 
ance of the hands. It may be used, 
when placed low, as.a balancing beam, 
or when placed high,.as a horizontal 
bar for hanging, swinging, and turning. 
It can also be used, if properly placed 
in the gymnasium, as a rest for the lower 
end of the adjustable ladders, thus dis- 
pensing with the foot piece. The bar 
can be removed and sticks or cords 
placed across the pins for jumping, 
taking the place of jumpstandards. As 
: ordinarily used in the gym- 
nasium it consists of two 
upright stand- 
ards fastened at 
the bottom tothe 
floor, and at the 
top tothe ceiling 
of the room, or to 
= braces ex t end- 
Fig. 15.—Jump stand and mat. ing from a gal- 
lery or the side oftheroom. Itis sometimes arranged toswing up out of the way. For 
school gymnasium work the standards should be independent of any fastenings but 
that of the floor, and arranged to be taken out of the way, leaving the room clear for 
marching andl calisthenic drill. The bar is generally made of hickory, with a steel 
core extending through it from end to end, and has iron caps at the ends arranged to 
fasten tothe uprights by means of pins passing through holes in the caps and the 
uptights. This is the Only form that can be depended on as being absolutely secure, 
and all frictional méans of fastening the bar to the uprights or clamping to the 
uprights or other ways should be avoided, as they are liable to cause serious acci- 
dents. Each bar, with its pair of uprights, will cost from $25 to $40. 
Balancing apparatus.— Apparatus for balancing is much used in gymnasiums for 
~girls. Its use makes them sure-footed, and by practice in keeping the equilibrium 
gives them confidence in their own powers. Its exercises also strengthen the spine 
And make young girls walk with a graceful poise of body. The adjustable ladder, 
illustrated previously, in some of its positions, is a desirable piece of apparatus for 
balancing. A balancing beam is astraight plank, held firmly by feet, withits edge

apward. It is about 12 feet long. Several of them should be provided for a large 
class. They cost $4.50 each. 
Parallel bars are sometimes used in a school gymnasium, although from the diffi- 
culty of storing them out of the 
way, and the fact that the exer- 
cises on them are quite arduous, 
they are not so popular as other 
apparatus. 
[It will be observed that the 
writer of the aboye omits all refer- 
ence to the vaulting-horse, buck, 
quarter-circle, amd other machines 
commonly found in American gym- 
nasiums. The reasons for the’omis- 
sion are probably similar to those 
indicated in the remarks on the 
parallel bars.—ED.] 
Apparatus for. Swedish gymnas- 
ti Although in the lower grade 
of schools no apparatus is used for 
- Swedish gymnastics, in the more 
advanced work apparatus is as 
desirable as in any system, The 
apparatus described below is made Fia. 16—Horizontal bar.

ing bar, but if has two bars, neither of which is round. One of them is in shape 
nearly like an isosceles triangle with its angles rounded off; the broader edge, the 
base of the triangle, may be turned upward and used as a, balancing beam, while 
the other edge, the apex of the triangle, affords a better hold for the hands. The 
other. bar is shaped somewhat like a conventional heart, but, of course, without 
angles. The grooved or double edge may be turned up for those with small hands, 
or to allow a different grasp. These bars are quite long, from 12 to 16 feet, from 6 
to 8 inches deep, and 3 or 4 inches thick. Three or four students can veult, jump, 
_or otherwiso exercise on the bars at one time. They are generally arranged so as to 
be taken down out of the way if desired. 
Ladders.—Swedish ladders consist of a series of square openings about 20 inches 
wide, with rungs generally 3 inches in width, and as long or as wide as space and 
material will permit. They may be suspended on the ends or at the side, as desired. 
They are entirely different from the ordinary gymnasium Jadder, as are the exercises 
on them, 
Bar stalls.—These are arranged to be fastened against the wall, as is shown in 
Fig.17. The bench is used in connection with the bar stalls. 
Vaulting box.—This is a box about 5 feet long, having inclined sides and a padded 
top about 1 foot wide. It is raised or lowered by changing the sections that form 
the lower part. 
From A. G. SpaLpina & Bros., PHILADELPHIA, Pa. 
Our idea of school apparatus is that it should be light, strong, and portable. 
There are very few of theschool-houses now built that have been provided with a special 
room for gymnasium work. | In a great many cases the rooms have to perform a dual 
service of recitation room and gymnasium, or hall and gymnasium. The apparatus 
designed by us is.of such a character that a fuily equipped gynmasium can be moved 
inside of five minutes without marking. or destroying the appearance of the room. 
Where the floors are perforated or drilled into for guys or stay rods we have a plate 
that is so constructed that as soon as the guy or stay is removed a spring disk fills the 
orifice. 
In regard to outdoor gymnasiums, we have found that the following style of con- 
struction has given eyery satisfaction: To make a frame work of either iron or wood, 
covering the space set apart for gymnasium use, the height of the frame being not 
less than 20 feet. From this can be suspended flying rings, traveling rings, rope lad- 
ders, climbing and knotted rope, giant stride, and a horizontal ladder. The ladder 
should be dropped within 8 feet of the ground. For floor apparatus, horizontal and 
parallel bars could be used; also vaulting horse and buck. As mattresses could 
hardly be used out in the open air, we find that tan bark makes a very desirable 
floor, there being enough spring in it-to prevent any serious injury from falling. 
Where tan bark can not be procured sand is the next best thing. 
Of course, the number of duplications in the appended list of apparatus would 
depend largely upon the size of the grounds, the number of pupils, and the amount 
of mouey to be spent. 
In new school buildings, where it is the intention to build a room purposely for 
gymnasium use, all possible obstruction should be avoided, i. e., supporting posts 
and pillars through the center of the room. The heating apparatus should be 
arranged so that it will not take up valuable wall space. Where it is possible the 
heat should be conducted from below through registers, rather than using steam- 
heating coils in tho room itself, as the latter takes up a great deal-of valuable space 
and are in the main very undesirable. Another improved feature would be to have 
the windows not lower than 5} feet from the floor. By placing the windows at that 
height from the floor you get the advantage of a solid wall space all around the 
room, and as wall apparatus of various kinds embodies the fundamental principles 
of ‘body building” a great deal of wall space is required. The height of ceiling 
 
-P-A-G-E-603

should not be less than 20-feet. A gallery encircling the room is very desirable, as 
the surface or top can be used as a running track. The underneath part can be 
used for suspended apparatus. The height of the gallery from the floor should not 
be less than 12 feet. In rooms not originally intended for gymnasium purposes we 
would suggest the following style of apparatus: Pulley weights; these to include 
upper and lower chest machines, chest developers and expanders, wrist-rollers, 
traveling parallels, etc. Where there is an instructor we would include in this 
horizontal bar; also parallel bar. If there is no instructor we would omit the 
parailel bar. In addition to the above named we would, of course, include mattresses, 
Indian clubs, dumb-bells, and wands; also inflated or lively striking bag. Where 
the room will permit it the suspended disk is preferable. The disk should not be 
less than 6 feet in diameter, and be made very stiff and strong; 7 feet 8 inches is 
the-proper height from the floor. Where the funds or room will not permit of this 
style bag the suspended style can be used. This is hung between ceiling and floor, 
having about 18 inehes or 2 feet of rubber at top and bottom. When struck it 
returns very quickly and affords both exercise and amusement.

FROM THE SCHUMACHER GYMNASIUM COMPANY, AKRON, OHIO, 
Regarding the requirements of the gymnasium and the possibility of adapting 
rooms designed for other purposes to gymnasiums, it might be said that any room is 
better than none. Almost any room may be made valuable-as a gympasium, but its 
value will always be proportionate to its advantages; that is, the more desirable 
features it possesses the more benefit may be derived from it. 
By desirable features we mean first, light, ventilation, facilities for controlling the 
‘temperature, etc. ; second, appropriate design; third, accessibility. 
The same sanitary rules apply here that apply in other schoolrooms, bearing in 
mind, however, that increased respiration and perspiration demand a greater supply 
of fresh air and a more frequent complete change of atmosphere. 
The walls may be of wood, stone, or brick, but it is preferable that they be of 
wood, and ifnot sheathed entirely a desirable arrangement is to have them sheathed 
from the floor to a height of about 5 feet, being finished at the top with a neat 
molded board 6 to 8 inches wide, which should be placed so that its center shall be 
at a height of 5 feet from the floor, as all wall machines will require an attaching 
point at that height. 
The ‘‘ wall board” at a height of 5 feet is almost a positive requirement, unless 
the room be full sheathed, and even then is not out.of place. A ‘base board,” say 8 
inches deep and three-quarters of an inch thick at the floor line, is also desirable, but 
not necessary. 
The windows are preferably placed high up from the floor. 
For heating, steam is entirely suitable, and in sct.ool buildings is usually avail- 
able. Where possible to avoid, however, do not have radiators on the floor; have 
coils of pipe around the room, high up from the floor, immediately under the running 
gallery, if there is one. The heat will then be better distributed, pupils working at 
‘wall machines will not be exposed to direct heat, and there will be no wall space 
occupied, as is the case where radiators are used. If, however, radiators are pre- 
ferred, have them placed high up on the wall on brackets, say 6 feet from the floor, 
and thus as nearly as possible approach the arrangement suggested. 
The ceiling should be of good height where it can be had, and where hanging, - 
swinging, and flying apparatus is to be used, as in schools for older pupils, the ceil- 
ing should be 16, 18, or even 20 feet high. No finish is required overhead, except 
such as may be desired for appearances, and ina gymnasium bare beams are entirely 
appropriate and afford excellent points of attachment for overhead apparatus. 
Of course, if a building might be constructed for a gymnasium, there are several 
   
-P-A-G-E-605
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 577 
desirable features that might be introduced, adapting it to its purpose and with 
proportionately increased results. 
If the room is of generous size and a running track may be introduced, much will 
be added to the value of the gymnasium. 
Such a track is best laid ona raised gallery, preferably hung by iron rods from 
the beams overhead or supported on brackets from the wall; posts or pillars from the 
floor should be avoided as much as possible. The, gallery should be from 44 to 6 feet 
in width and about 10 feet from the floor, it should have curves of large radii at the 
corners and in fact if convenient, might be semicircular at the ends, but never less 
than 8 feet radius. 
Again, if we may dwell on ideal construction, and the building may be supposed 
to have been constructed expressly for a gymnasium, there should be bathing facil- 
ities and locker rooms, which are best placed immediately under the gymnasium 
floor. They will not require a great ceiling height, but should be as well heated and 
ventilated as the gymnasium proper and require besides an effective system of drain- 
age.. 
In many schools an assembly hall is provided for general school exercises and in 
some cases provisions made for visitors. A gymnasium could be easily designed that 
would be complete as a gymnasium and yet serve as a hall for the other school work 
and might have a gallery for a running track and an extension back of the track for 
visitors, with a physical director’s and an examination room below on the main floor 
and a platform for the physical director near his room. 
In case of commencement or other public exhibition the visitors may use the whole 
gallery as well as the floor, and the director’s room become a dressing room and his 
platform serves the speakers. 
But with the present outlook, baths, locker rooms, director’s and examination 
rooms, and perhaps even the examination itself must be omitted and the most good 
be gotten out of existing circumstances. 
As to equipment, it is safe to say that the basis of the outfit (if it extends at all 
beyond dumb-bells and wands) must be the chest weight which not only provides 
exercise for almost all the muscles of the body and an infinite variety of movements, 
but is so completely under control and is so readily adapted to all classe§ and all 
degrees of strength, that injury or even failure to benefit is almost impossible. 
Of the chest weights, therefore, we advise ample supply and a few special.forms 
of pulley weights for particular groups of muscles; as the intercostal, the name of 
which indicates the muscles reached; the quarter circle, an excellent device for 
raising the front chest walls, developing the abdominal muscles and correcting 
stooping ‘shoulders; as is also the pectoral machine, which is desirable for pupils 
who bend greatly over their work. 
A chest weight, having a ‘‘floor attachment” and known as a back and loin 
machine, provides work for those parts and is readily convertible into a regular © 
chest weight, or one or more may be added. 
A neat attachment, called a “neck strap,” is manufactured by us, and may be 
instantly attached to any chest-weight handle, making a complete neck machine for 
exercising the muscles of the neck and upper back; there may be a number of these 
straps; they do not in any way interfere with the use of the chest weight, as they 
may be as quickly removed as attached. 
A wrist roll will provide exercise for the forearm and wrist, and is preferably 
operated by friction and arranged to be adjusted to different powers. 
A finger machine, operated by an adjustable spring and provided with a roller 
finger bar, develops the muscles of the fingers and forearm, relieves cramped hands, 
and renders stiff fingers supple. 
The foregoing machines may be arranged around the walls, all requiring wall 
attachment; the arrangement will vary with the design of the room, but it will be 
well to keep apparatus of one kind or class as much as possible together, for con- 
venience in operating as well as for symmetrical appearance. 
ED 92 37  
-P-A-G-E-606
    578 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Note here that chest weights should be placed 6 feet apart in order to permit 
extended-arm movements. 
The above-named pieces are desirable and advisable in schools of all ages, and 
the list contains nothing that is injurious to a growing child or is liable to misuse 
tending to be otherwise than beneficial. It is all compact, occupying space close 
to the wall; and, together with a complement of dumb-bells, wands, and, perhaps, 
wooden rings, might provide an acceptable list for the younger classes, having 
sufficient variety to gain and hold the interest and attention of the pupil. 
The pieces mentioned may be merely added to for older pupils, as almost all of 
them are capable of immediate adjustment to greater power, and more difficult or 
more vigorous work on the other pieces will adapt them to the increased strength 
and endurance of advanced pupils. 
The dumb-bells need not necessarily be increased in weight, those weighing from 
1 to 2 pounds will be sufficiently heavy for the entire school course. In the high 
schools, howeyer, as both muscular power and muscular control are increased, Indian 
clubs may be introduced, the use of which not only develops muscle and adds grace, 
but, by the rhythmic beat of the circles, teaches physical judgment perhaps as well 
as any of the lighter apparatus. There should be a sufficient number of clubs and 
bells provided to supply the largest class that is to be handled, and hooks and 
hangers will be required in which they should be kept when not in use. 
For the older classes we would also advise the introduction of some of the heavier 
pieces requiring the support and control of the body by the arms, on which class 
of apparatus the weight of the body is the resistance to be overcome: by the 
muscles. This class of apparatus is especially valuable for instinctively teaching 
muscular control, physical judgment, and physical courage, all of which are of 
such great advantage to the pupil in later years. 
Chief among apparatus of the latter class is the regular parallel bars, a piece which 
provides a great variety of movements calculated to produce agility and grace of 
movement in addition to the above-mentioned acquirements. 
The work on the parallel bars should be vigorous but not violent, although the 
strain is almost wholly on the groups of heavier muscles. 
Mats should be provided for use with these bars to prevent injury to feet and 
ankles by alighting on the hard floor. The bars are well adapted for class work on 
the “ follow my leader” principle and are in circuit with the vaulting bar, vaulting 
horse, and traveling or flying rings. If necessary the class may be divided into 
“squads,” each squad to be under the leadership of some more advanced or more 
proficient scholar who is careful and will command conscientious work on the part 
of the members of his squad, the director overseeing the whole and having the plan 
of work laid out and adapted to the class. 
The vaulting bar as mentioned might well be a part of the outfit, and as it is 
adjustable in height, it may be used as one of the introductory pieces to the heavier 
apparatus. A large number of trunk movements are possible on this bar besides 
those of direct vaulting and it is considered indispensable in most gymnasia. 
The breast bars are also much used and are entirely practicable in a school gym- 
nasium. They are useful for deepening the chest and they also reach the muscles of 
the back and arms in connection with a “brick or foot block” and a strap (breast 
bar or abdominal strap) encircling the two bars. Good back and loin work may be 
done with or without dumb bells in the hands. As to arrangement, they are pref- 
erably run to the ceiling, if not too high, or under the gallery, if there is one, but 
they may be braced out from the wall or run across a corner; one pair is probably 
sufficient, although two pairs give three spaces. 
For hanging or swinging apparatus, first comes the flying rings, the exercise on 
which is of a recreative character and is excellent for the intercostal muscles and 
raising the side wall of the chest. 
Other hanging apparatus shorld be traveling rings, a rope ladder, a knotted rope or 
rosary, and a climbing rope (smooth), and in this connection we would advise, as 
 
-P-A-G-E-607
          579 
  PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
adapted to the older classes and requiring less exertion in climbing, the peg pole, not 
the old wooden post with the slipplery wooden pegs, but the new device, which has 
overcome all the difficulties previously experienced and removed all objection to this 
valuable apparatus. 
The rope ladders next, perhaps, and may be even used before the peg poles, as it 
allows the climber to use the feet as well as the hands. It is a preparatory piece, 
entirely safe, and teaches confidence to the pupil who is unused to being off the floor. 
The rosary is a heavy manila rope 4 inches in circumference, on which at intervals 
of about 8 inches are arranged sewn-in knots of smaller braided cord, forming hold- 
ing points for the hands. These knots should be sewn through the rope and not tied 
in or around it. 
The climbing rope is identical with the rosary, with the exception that it is per- 
fectly smooth and has no knots. It is of four-stranded 4-inch manila, The opera- 
tion of climbing is more severe on this rope, as the hand must grasp the smooth 
rope and no vantage points are provided. 
One each of these climbing pieces will be all that is required, and with an adjust- 
able ladder and perhaps a giant stride will constitute the hanging apparatus, 
although, of course, there are numerous other pieces of this class, some of which 
might be introduced in the school. 
The giant stride is essentially a school piece, and may be used by the girls as well 
as the boys. It consists of four (or more) ropes carrying handles or rings, as desired, 
suspended from the ceiling by a swiveled head or plate. In operation, as many boys 
or girls as there are handles or rings grasp them and, running in a circle, are swung 
up by centrifugal force, being kept up by the vigorous pushings of the first one to 
touch the floor. It is enjoyable, exhilarating, and beneficial, and practically free 
from danger. : 
The adjustable ladder is a most valuable piece and your physical director will 
make excellent use of it. 
Among the heavy floor or portable pieces the most desirable is the vaulting horse, 
on which several hundred distinct and recognized movements are made and which 
is considered indispensable in a complete gymnasium if a thorough course is to be 
given; it consists in simple form, of a padded body supported on legs, and has from 
this been developed into one of the cleveresé and most complete devices used in the 
gymnasium, > 
Aleaping board and, perhaps, a pair of jumping stands would complete a very: 
fair outfit for a high school, for while there is a practically unlimited variety of 
pieces, all of them may not be advantageously used in the public school, especially 
if the pupil must exercise without proper gymnasium costume. We would mention 
here that it would be well to cause each member of the class to have for gymnasium 
use a pair of soft-soled shoes, both for the preservation of the apparatus and for the 
freedom allowed the feet, which is denied them by the stiff-soled street shoes. 
Much of the foregoing, of course, is based on the ideal school gymnasium, and 
while practicable and desirable, may not be attainable; in fact it is-probable that 
much of the school gymnasinm work will be of a very simple order for the present, 
and until the public is educated to a knowledge of its value.

CHAPTER XIV. 
THE AGE OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS." 
[In determining to what extent the public schools are utilized, or how 
many years each child attends school, it becomes important to know 
the average age of withdrawal, or time of leaving school. Attention 
was called to prevailing misconceptions on the subject in the St. Louis 
school report of 187879, and a method, devised by Prof. C. M. Wood- 
ward, was there given for computing the average age of pupils at 
the time of leaving school. In order to bring this method more fully 
to the notice of the publicit has been deemed advisable to reproduce it 
here. | 
In considering the question of the usefulness of public schools, as 
well as in discussing the propriety of admitting pupils at an early age, 
it is the custom to have recourse to the statistics of the ages of those 
enrolled. These statistics show the number who attend school at each 
age. Nothing seems simpler than to determine from this the average . 
time of leaving school. “If 9 years and 4 months is the average age of 
those in attendance on school, it shows that the average age of leaving 
school is less than 10 years.” Yet this is wholly fallacious, as will 
appear from the following consideration: If the course of study in a 
school lasted for twelve years, and the classes continued throughout 
the entire course without change of individuals, or diminution in num- 
bers, or loss of grade or rank, an equal number entering every year in 
the first year’s course, would give, in the course of twelve years, an 
equal number of pupils in each class, from the highest to the lowest. 
There would be, say 50 pupils in each grade or year’s work, and 600 in the 
whole school... Supposing the pupils to enter,at 6 years and graduate at 
18 years, there would be 50 pupils at 6 years, 50 pupils at 7 years, ete., 
and the average of the entire school would be 12 years of age; and yet 
from this itis clear that we could not infer that the average pupil leaves 
at 12 years, because each and every one contifiues until he is 18 years of 
age. Itis clear that this average age is found only by comparing the 
number of pupils in the graduating class with the same class when it 
entered. If it entered with 100 and graduated with 100, the course of 
study of each and every one in the class averages twelve years, and 
the average pupil of that class will get the twelve years’ schooling. If 
the class enters with 240, and graduates with 20, losing one-twelfth each 
year, it will follow that the twelve years apiece which the 20 get, will, 
if averaged, give the whole 240 each one year. The eleven years which 
the next 20 get will give the 240 eleven-twelfths of a year, ete. The 
average amount of schooling would be six and one-half years, and the

    596 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-93. 
average age of leaving school (if entered at 6) would be 124 years, 
although the table of ages of a school of 1,560 pupils, arranged accord- 
ing to the supposed scale, would give only one and three-tenths per 
eentum in the senior class, and only two and six-tenths per centum in 
the class next to the senior class; and under such circumstances some 
would-be economical reformer might use this argument against the high 
school department (which would include the last four years of this 
twelve-year course), and say: “Less than 2 pupils in a hundred ever 
graduate from the high school; it is for the few only; it is a rich man’s 
institution,” etc., and yet of the class of 240 who entered, there were 
20 left, or 1 in 12—84 in 100 instead of 1.3. 
Hence, we may infer * = * on comparison of those of 14 
years of age (4 per centum) with those at 8 years (12 per centum), 
that at least one-third of those at 8 years of age remain in school until 
they are 14 yearsofage. But the city is increasing in population rap- 
idly, both by immigration and by the birthrate. The latter item con- 
tinues to give us larger numbers of pupils in the primary grades. A 
reliable estimate must take into account all those items of fluetuation— 
birthrate, death rate among children, access and depletion from migra- 
tion at different ages, ete. 
This topic is so important that Imake a long extract from an exhaust- 
ive article treating the subject, which appeared in the American 
Journal of Education (published by J. B. Merwin), St. Louis, May, 
1879 (omitting the algebraic table [No. II], in which Prof. Woodward 
has generalized his results and given a general formula for obtaining 
the average age at which school children leave school): 
AT WHAT AGE DO PUPILS WITHDRAW FROM THE ST, LOUIS PUBLIC SCHOOLS? 
1. Before attempting to answer this question, I desire to call attention to the obvious 
importance of a correct answer. The best planned course of study takes into con- 
sideration both the probable duration of a school course and the age of the pupils. 
The direct bearing of this question is seen in the fact that an estimated average 
length of the period of pupilage is frequently made the basis of arguments for or 
against some proposed modification of the course of study, or some other detail of 
school management. e 
2. Iuse the word ‘ withdraw” in this paper ina somewhat restricted sense, and 
as properly excluding the effect of mortality among school children; that is to say, 
I exclude from among the number of those who can with propriety be said to ‘ with- 
draw from school” those whose school course is cut short by death. Fortunately, 
this allowance in St. Louis is small, but it is not on that account to be ignored. 
The propriety of omitting those who die, from my calculations, can not be seriously 
questioned. The practical inquiry is: At what age do pupils leave school to enter 
upon the active duties of life? and it should not be complicated with the very dif- 
ferent question of the age at which pupils die without completing the course of study 
contemplated. Though nearly one-half of all the children born in this city die 
without reaching the age of 5 years, we plan for each newcomer on the basis of a 
probable long life. Again, although the average length of human life in St. Louis 
appears, from the recorded ages of those who die, to be less than 22 years, our sys- 
tems of education rest upon the supposition that, among other responsibilities for
-P-A-G-E-625

the discharge of which children must be educated, the boys, at least, must be pre- 
pared for the duties of electors, though such duties do not come till after the age 
of 21, 
3. The.value of my results wili, of course, depend upon my assumptions, as well 
as upon absolute data and my methods of calculation. In 1868-69, I find that 2,917 
children were registered at 8 years old. I propose to follow these 2,917 children 
through their career as pupils of the public schools, noting the number dropping 
out cach year till all are gone; then Ishall find the average age at withdrawal. The 
annual registers of the schools contain, of course, all needed information, but it 
would be an endless task to follow the pupils as they change from school to school, 
finally disappearing from the records altogether. I must, therefore, abstract their 
history from such other records as are at my command. For my data I rely almost 
entirely upon the annual reports of Superintendent Harris. Each of these reports 
gives a table of the ‘‘ number of pupils of different ages registered during the year.” 
With the exception of the last two or three reports the number of children ‘7 
years and under” is given without subdivisions, and in all reports those of “16 
years and over” are grouped together. I have, therefore, been obliged to begin my 
investigation with those who are 8 years of age. 
4, I assume that in the sense in which I use the word, no child under 8 years of 
age in St. Louis ever “ withdraws” from'school.! The enrollment of names is made 
when the pupils enter the school, which is generally in September; the enrollment 
made at other times is very small, the spring registrations being mainly those of 
young pupils first entering school. 
5. I assume that those who leave the public schools at the age of 9 years or more 
stop going to school altogether, though it is well known that many do attend other 
schools. 
6. I exclude from my calculations those children who enter the public schools for 
the first time when 9 or more years of age. It is quite possible that the entire 
school period of such is greater than theaverage, but there are no available data on 
which to base a determination. 
7. I assume that one-half of those reported as “16 years and over” are 16, and 
that the other half average 17 years of age at the time of enrollment. Actual figures 
would perhaps show an average somewhat greater. 
8. Inow call attention to Table I, which needs but a few words of explanation. 
The figures are taken from the reports of the superintendent without change, except 
in the case of the report of 1872-73, from which the suburban schools of the (old) 
Thirteenth ward have been omitted, and the report of 1877-’78, from which I have 
eliminated the 16 suburban schools, as they do not appear in former reports. The 
arrangement of the table is such that the pupils who were enrolled year after year, 
and appear in different reports under different ages, are here placed in the same 
column, the age of each class being given in heavy type. Three of these columns are* 
nearly complete, headed A, B, C. Iuse these columns for three independent caleula- 
tions. The last two lines contain some estimates which the rest of the table will 
justify. 
9. Let us examine column A. The report of 1868-’69 shows the enrollment of 
2,917 children during that scholastic year who were in theirninth year. The nextyear 
these children were all in their tenth year and they numbered 3,161. This increase can 
be accounted for only by immigration of 9-year-old children, and by the enrollment   
  
  
1Some of the later reports may seem to prove this assumption to be not well 
founded, inasmuch as the number recorded as 8 years old may be considerably less 
than the number enrolled as 7 years old the previous year. In such an event, it is 
well to consider the spring enrollment of those who are ‘‘7 years old,” and who do 
not become 8 tillafter September, and consequently are asecond time enrolled as “7 
years old.” The result is the ‘7 years” list is abnormally large.

of city children who, during the previous year, had either not attended school at all 
or had attended private schools. But it is not-probable that all of the 2,917 returned 
to school in 1869~70. Some had died; some had moved from the city; some had 
gont to private schools; some, perhaps, had stopped going to school. Now, before 
we can approximate the number of those who had left, we must arrive at a fair 
estimate of the number of new scholars in the class. For the latter purpose we must 
compare classes of the same age in the two years, i. e., those of 8 years, 9 years, etc., 
in 1868-’69, with those of 8 years, 9 years, etc., in 1869~70. We find an average 
increase of 124 per cent pretty evenly distributed through all the school ages. It is 
therefore probable that the addition to our class under discussion was in the same 
ratio, or 12% per cent of 2,917, which is 373. Had no pupils left the class it would 
have numbered, with this increase, 2,917-+373—3,290. As the enrollment was only 
3,161, it is evident that 129 must have left during or at the end of the year 1868-’69. 
A comparison of the classes of 1869~70 with those of the same age in 1870~71 
shows a growth of 12 per cent. Twelve per cent of 3,161 is 379, which is the 
growth ‘of the schools in the 10-year-old class. The enrollment of the year shows 
3,368; hence the loss during, or at the end of, 1869-70 was 3,1614-379—3,368—172. 
In the same way the total loss has been worked out for each of the years in column 
A. Unquestionably, my figures vary considerably from the facts in individual cases, 
but it may safely be assumed that the errors balance. The ‘annual increase” is 
given in Table I in per cents. The growth of classes, the “ possible number” (had 
the class suffered no loss), and the total loss are given for each year of colamn A, in 
Table II. 5 
The annual increase from 1877-78 to 1878-79 and from 1879 to 1879-’80 has been 
assumed as 6 per cent. 
10. Let us now consider these columns of ‘totul loss.” The 129 lost the first year, 
column A, were all out of the original 2,917. The 3,161 of the next year contained 
only 2,788 old scholars and 373 new ones. Now, in the course of a year they lost 172 
more. I assume that this loss was distributed among the old and new scholars in 
proportion to their number. This results in a loss to the original class during this 
second year of 152, reducing it to 2,636. In the same way I find that of the 573 lost 
the next year, 448 were from the original class. The seventh column in Table IL 
gives these proportionate losses from the original class, and the eighth column gives 
the number of the 2,917 with whom we started, remaining in school year after year. 
The last division left school in June, 1878. Few of that class may be left in the 
high and the normal schools, but they would only serve to show that my result is 
too small. Tables III and IV contain similar columns, though the intermediate 
columns are omitted. 
11. I now come to the last correction to be applied to the annual losses, and 
that is the deduction of the number of those who died while they were virtually 
pupils of the schools. Reports show that the death rate for school children is about 
four per 1,000 annually. I have, therefore, assumed that each year a part of the 
losses are from death, and I have deducted from the loss four-thousandths of the 
number remaining from the original class during the previous year. The remain- 
ders are clearly the numbers “ withdrawn ” and are entered in the next column. 
12. The last column contains merely the products of the number of pupils with- 
drawing, multiplied by their age. The withdrawals do not always occur at the end 
of the year. I assume that, on the average, pupils withdraw six months from the 
beginning of the year. The average age, for exumple, of those registered as 10 
years is 10 years and 6 months at the time of registration; those leaving before 
another enrollment are, therefore, 11 years old. Thus the 117 who withdrew in 
1868-’69 were 9 years old, the 141 were 10 years old, etc. 
13, The average age obtained from A is 13.7 years; from B, 13.5 years; from C 
13.6 years.

CHAPTER XY. 
CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 
[In the following extracts from the reports ot the St. uouis public 
schools, I have brought together the different discussions made from 
year to year, while the experiment in shortening the intervals between 
classes was in process of trial. In the Annual Report of this Bureau 
for last year the statistics from several hundred cities, and opinions from 
a large number of superintendents, were printed showing the status 
of this important question in the management of city schools. An 
extensive correspondence has been carried on with teachers and super- 
intendents in all parts of the country, and there has been frequent 
occasion to refer to the more elaborate discussion of the problems 
involved in the shortening of the intervals between classes as found 
in the reports of the St. Louis schools. Those discussions are here 
reprinted for convenient reference. | 
ADVANTAGES OF THE GRADED SYSTEM.! 
By the graded system I understand that in which the course of study 
is carefully arranged in accordance with the natural order of succession 
in the several branches; lowest in the course, the most elementary 
studies, followed by those that rank next in complexity, and unfold 
directly from the preceding, each study so graded as to advance in due 
proportion to all the others. At a certain stage of the pupil’s progress 
in reading he is allowed to take up arithmetic, soon after that, geogra- 
phy, then grammar, then history. No branch of instruction is to come 
in before the requisite advance is made in those studies which are intro- 
ductory to it. With this careful arrangement of the course of study 
there is also proper classification of pupils. The gradation of the course 
of study makes this possible. All pupils at a certain stage of advance- 
ment in a given branch are in the same class throughout all the others. 
When the course of study and classification is not thus fixed, there is 
more or less abnormal culture going on; some pupils taking up studies 
without learning the rudimentary presuppositions; some pupils study- 
ing Latin and algebra before they know English grammar and ordi- 
nary arithmetic. The regularity and consequent simplicity introduced 
into the school system by gradation and classification increases the 
power of the teacher incaleulably. Instead of infinitesimal subdivisions

of his school, amounting almost to the making of a class for each indi- 
vidual in each branch, and the consequent reduction of the teacher to 
the office of private tutor to each pupil, in the graded-school system a 
few classes comprise all the pupils of the school. The consequence is 
that the corps of teachers divide their labor, each taking two classes 
nearly of the same grade, and are able to concentrate all their energies 
on one point. The class can have thirty to forty minutes’ time for reci- 
tation, whereas, if unclassified, each individual could get two minutes, 
more or less. But the teacher trains all to the.habit of close attention 
throughout the recitation, so that each individual not only gets his 
thirty minutes as certainly as though he were the sole member of the 
class, but he gets far more. The stimulating effect of the exhibition 
afforded by the struggles of his fellows is the most valuable part. He 
sees his fellow pupils all striving for the same goal as himself; the les- 
sons of their failures and success give him insight into his own, and 
deepen indefinitely the impression made by his private study in pre- 
paring his lessons. The complete dissipation of all the energy and 
faculty of the teacher by the nonclassified scheme, renders him unable 
to produce any grand effect with his school, as a whole, and thus each 
pupil loses that important culture derived from mingling his individu- 
ality with that of the whole, subordinating his own caprices to the will 
of the community, and finding his pleasure in the effect produced by 
the organism of which he is a member. 
These advantages of the graded-school system are obvious, and the 
result of their discovery and application is that all celebrated schools, 
both public and private, are graded in accordance with this scheme. 
No system of schools, supervised by one head, is possible without such 
grading—the results of one teacher could never be compared with those 
of another. 
DISADVANTAGES OF THE GRADED SYSTEM. 
On the other hand, there is a defect in the graded system which, 
though not often named and defined by educators, is nevertheless felt 
by the community at large. What I refer to is not the usual objection 
made—“ that under the system named the work of the schoolroom 
becomes monotonous and like a treadmill; that it serves as a kind of 
Procrustean bed to hold back the talented pupil, while it does not ben- 
efit his dull companion”—for this can be avoided very easily by a sys- 
tem of promotions; the pupil is stimulated and encouraged by this. 
The obverse side is the worst—the discouragement produced by plac- 
ing pupils in lower classes is the disastrous phase of the subject. The 
pupil who tries his best and then fails is deeply injured, and is apt to 
endeayor to preserve his self-respect by some sort of subterfuge. He 
accuses his teacher of partiality, it may be, or attributes the good suc- 
cess of his companions to the assistance of others. The root of all bit- 
terness is loss of self-respect; the man or child who goes about thinking
-P-A-G-E-631
  CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 603 
himself shut out from participation in the highest by his own natural 
incapacity is like one inclosed in a tomb while yet living. It is easy to 
see that this is the source of most of the difficulties which the graded- 
school system has to meet and overcome. 
In the first place, there is difference in capacity; the temperaments 
differ; the relative mental endowments differ; tastes differ. And yet, 
in the graded school all are to be compared with the same standard. 
It is not surprising that evil consequences arise. The pupil is “sent 
over his course” again and again, falling back from class to class. He 
becomes stolid and lifeless, and reminds one never so much of the burnt- 
out coal in the grate which we name a “clinker.” The teacher loses all 
patience: “The majority of the class can not be kept back on your 
account alone.” 
The closer the grading the better the classification is, and the fewer 
the “‘clinkers” developed; i. e., if the classification is made right at 
the beginning. For where widely different attainments meet in the 
same class it must needs happen that some will find the lesson, that is 
adapted to the average of the class too easy, others will find it too 
hard. On the other hand, the severity of the teacher may contribute 
largely to swell the unfortunate class of pupils referred to. While 
severity may at times arouse latent energy, it as frequently closes up 
entirely that unfolding of the faculties which requiresa genial, sunshiny 
surrounding as much as does the bloom of a plant. : 
When municipal governments are expending large sums for infirm- 
aries and asylums, realizing the Christian humanitarian principle in 
the State, it is certainly inconsistent to neglect a class of pupils and 
allow them to make shipwreck of their educational hopes. And yet it 
must be confessed that a large percentum of the pupils in our graded 
schools, after falling behind their classes, get discouraged and go, a 
few to private schools, most of them into spheres of manual labor or 
mercantile business, and forever renounce an education that would fit 
them to rise to the higher walks of life. Society recognizes its duty to 
care specially for all who are unable to direct their own activity in the 
regular channels of industry. It provides for the poor, nurses the’ 
indigent sick in its hospitals, and furnishes a retreat for its insane. 
In order that the inducement to educate the children may be as strong 
as possible for the parent, he is taxed by the laws for the support of 
schools, in proportion to his estate, and free schools are opened for all, 
rich and poor. But this is not enough. The school system must be 
made effective in the highest sense, and special provision must be made 
for weak or abnormal minds. The educational system should have in 
it the means of correcting any tendencies in the wrong direction. 
THE REMEDY—A SPECIAL SCHOOL. 
The evils here spoken of may be remedied only by great care on the 
part of the teacher as to the habits or methods of study whigh the pupil 
has. For the reason that the evil becomes serious only in those grades 
 
-P-A-G-E-632
    604 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
as high as the grammar school, and is manifested chiefly in the class 
that passes from the district schools to the high school, it is clear that 
special classes should be made for such pupils. The regular class can 
not be kept back for them, nor will it do to degrade them to a lower. 
Accordingly, when the class is promoted as a whole on examination, 
one part can go to the high school, one part to the special school, where 
skillful teachers supervise and correct the habits of study, taking a 
slow course in the higher branches. Gradually the mental self-reliance 
increases, and the ability to overcome the full-length lesson is acquired. 
The pupil is then to be transferred to the high school. On this basis, 
and to test the truth of this theory, the board have, by a recent act 
(at the August meeting, 1869), established the ‘“ intermediate school.” 
Its results will furnish data on which safe future action may be based.) 
Public schools have generally been noted for thoroughness. This 
has been claimed as their greatest merit. Certain it is that very high 
percentages are required of pupils before promoting them to the next 
higher -grade in the course. It has not been sufficiently considered that 
there is a limit to the thoroughness desirable; that the time consumed 
in securing such high standards of thoroughness would have been bet- 
ter used by the pupil in mastering higher methods. Instead of solving 
the problem of higher arithmetic by arithmetical methods, he could 
more wisely have “flanked” them through algebra and trigonometry, 
and these latter studies would have opened up to him new worlds in. 
mathematics. Instead of pursuing topographical geography to exhaust- 
ive minuteness, his time would be better employed in mastering physi- 
eal and commercial geography; and so, instead of exhausting a “ com- 
pendious treatise on English grammar,” after acquiring its general out- 
lines, a few months’ study of Latin would give him the culture requisite 
to make a grammar for himself. : 
This point is the most important one involved in the present discus- 
sion. To what extent should thoroughness be relied on and to what 
extent should the advance be made by means of higher methods? 
Have not public schools held too exclusively to the former appliance, 
and thereby engendered the defect to which attention is here called? 
Private schools sometimes rely too exclusively on the latter appliance, 
    
  
1At the date this report goes to press the experiment has progressed far enough 
to justify its establishment. Of the 80 pupils admitted, the greater number were 
those from the district schools who failed to make the requisite per cent to enter 
the high school; some were from private schools, and had made more or less progress 
in the higher English branches or the languages. The result thus far has been such 
as to encourage the most sanguine hopes. Most were found to have bad habits of 
study, and these have been improved surprisingly; others were good scholars, but 
had not been quite long enough in the district schools to fit them for the high 
school. This class has saved a year’s study in the grammar schools, thus seeming 
to prove that the standard of perfection in the lower branches was unnecessarily 
high. The name “intermediate school” is not appropriate, inasmuch as it does 
not convey a correct impression regarding the character of the institution.
-P-A-G-E-633
  CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 605 
and in that case tend to produce smatterers. The true course, it seems, 
should use both appliances in their due proportion, and this can be 
determined by experience. This due proportion will be found when no 
pupilis kept using a lower method of solution after he is able readily 
to acquire the higher one. It is clear that too much attention can not 
be given to the formation of correct habits of study. But the discus- 
sion of the dangerous tendencies of the graded system should not lead 
one to suppose for a moment that the evils balance the good; for even 
where they are most injurious the positive benefits of grading predom- 
inate. In fact, most of what are called the evils of graded schools 
result from the lack of sufficient grading rather than from too much 
of it. : 
[From the St. Louis School Report of 187172, by W. T. Harris, superintendent.] 
The high-school course is divided into four classes, the work laid 
down for each occupying one year in its accomplishment. The fact 
that each high-school class is expected to begin its work in Sep- 
tember and complete it in June indicates at once the condition 
of things that I have already alluded to in this report. Such a 
course of study is “nailed to the calendar,” and its progress is rigid 
and determined by the lapse of time and not by the progress of the 
pupil. Ifa pupil is sick and unable to attend school for ten weeks, he 
finds, on his return, that there is no class just ready to admit him. 
The class’ which he left is now ten weeks in advance of him, and to 
make up this work and at the same time to do the regular work of the 
class is too difficult. . If it were possible, it would prove a superiority 
of individual work over work in a class. The pupil is probably obliged 
to enter the next class below, but this class is thirty weeks behind his 
present acquirements, and his ten weeks’ sickness has thus cost him a 
year’s progress. On entering the lower class, however, he finds him- 
self going over familiar ground and gets careless in his work. By the 
time his present class arrives at the work from which he was broken 
off by sickness the previous year he has acquired a loose habit of study, 
and is likely to fail on the first difficult study that he encounters. Two 
failures are pretty sure to complete his discouragement and cause him 
to leave school. Another case: A pupil, for some reason, is not quite 
able at the close of the year to pass the standard for admission to the 
next class, and is accordingly obliged to join the class below. He is 
set back just one year at once. He might have lacked five weeks’ 
study or ten weeks’ study—scarcely more than this—of completing 
the work of his class. But for this he is obliged to lose nearly a year 
more than was really necessary. It must be remembered that these 
are not isolated instances, but that the number of each class who ought 
to be separated, for one reason or another, from the part of the class 
that does the work of the grade thoroughly, is about one-third of the 
entire number. In order to avoid this evil of putting back pupils, there 
 
-P-A-G-E-634
  606 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
is a strong temptation to let them pass on at a low standard. The 
consequence of such a course is that each class is impeded in its work 
by the presence of a number who are not equal to the performance of 
their tasks. 
These evils are not confined to the classes of the high school; they 
extend to the higher classes of the district schools. Inasmuch as the 
examination for admission to the high school is to occur in June, the 
first grade’s work of the district school must be completed at that 
time, and hence must be commenced in September of each year. This 
fact in turn influences the time of beginning and completing the work 
of the second grade. The tendency of all this is to produce a system 
of classification throughout the entire course of the district schools 
similar to that in the high school. In this case classes would follow 
each other at intervals of a year, and the difficulty of properly assign- 
ing those who should be classified in grades between those established 
exists throughout the entire system. In many sections of the country— 
jn Ohio and New York, for example—this very practice prevails. A 
promotion takes place once or twice a year, on occasion of a general 
written examination by the superintendent. Those who “pass” go on; 
those who fail fall back to the lower class or leave school altogether. 
Such a system of grading and classification must be regarded as only 
one step above the system of unclassified schools. In our St. Louis 
schools the classification is so arranged in the lower grades of the dis- 
trict schools that classes follow each other at intervals of about six 
weeks. Should it be necessary to put back a pupil to a lower class, he 
finds it at just that stage of progress which will enable him to review 
and strengthen those portions of his course that need it. But this 
system allows of ancther advantage. As the highest class loses num- 
bers by promotion, graduation, or otherwise, its ranks are filled with 
the best pupils from the next lower class. The latter is again recruited 
by promotion of the best from the next one below it. This process is 
continued to the lowest class in school. After such a promotion 
has been made the account stands thus: Each class has sent forward 
perhaps one-third of its pupils (the best ones) to the next one above 
it, and has received the best third of the pupils from the class below. 
There has been no degradation of pupils. What can be said is that 
two-thirds of each class (including all the fair and middling scholars) 
were left, and a few of the foremost in rank of those below them admit- 
ted with them. Within less than a half-year’s work th® studious and 
brilliant pupils will work up to the top of the class. There willalways 
be differences of native power as well as of previous acquirement. Before 
a half a year has elapsed the two-thirds of a given class who pass for 
“fair and middling” scholars will be overtaken and, in some instances, 
surpassed by the brilliant pupils admitted from the lower class. A 
change of the kind I have mentioned, amounting to a readjustment of 
all the classes, is desirable as often as four times a year. If made, it
-P-A-G-E-635
  
CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 607 
will entirely prevent the collection, m any one class, of the dull and 
incapable scholars. These, for the most part, are pupils who have not 
become thoroughly aroused, or, more frequently, such as have become 
discouraged by degradation in rank. Their defect is not primarily 
intellectual, but moral; they have feeble wills. It is very rare that a 
pupil has so dull an intellect that he can not, if he possess a resolute 
will, accomplish any intellectual feat whatever by the aid of industry 
alone. Those who fail do so through lack of courage or of persever- 
ance. This furnishes the strongest ground of all against manipulating 
~ the system of classification in such a manner as to make those who are 
not promoted feel that they are degraded. By the method here 
described I think the minimum of discouragement is reached. Two- 
thirds or more of the class—enough to preserve the identity of the 
slass—remain after any reclassification, and, as this embraces many 
dair scholars, none need feel that they have been slighted. The change 
made has elevated the fair in rank to the highest rank in class and 
those who were poor to the rank of fair—at least for a time. Stimu- 
lated by this, they frequently increase in self respect and develop 
powers that had hitherto lain dormant. 
In what has been said the danger of collecting many poor pupils in 
the same class has been indicated. Our experiments have, I think, 
fully demonstrated that such a system is pernicious. Some years ago 
I recommended the establishment of an intermediate school for the 
purpose of classifying those pupils who fell short of the standard for 
admission to the high school, and yet who were so far advanced as to 
be greatly injured by setting back a year, and classifying them with 
pupils of the next grade. The experiment was continued for two 
years. It was found that the so-called brilliant pupils, those full of 
courage and resolution, even if admitted on a very low per cent (I 
admitted on trial some of this character who made only from 30 to 40 
per cent), were soon able to work their way to the top of their classes 
and to acquit themselves creditably. But those of enfeebled wills, 
having lost self-confidence or having become listless through disgust, 
were very slow in manifesting improvement. The practice of giving 
them short lessons was tried with some success, but a cloud hung over 
them and hangs over them still. (Some of them have been two years 
and a half in getting through one year’s work of the high school 
course, and are not able yet to pass their examination at the time this 
report goes to press, March, 1873.) I think that many of these pupils 
would have done better if they had been reclassified periodically, in 
the manner described, with fresh and ambitious pupils pushing up from 
below. I once compared these pupils to “clinkers,” or pieces of coal 
that do not readily kindle except in a very hot fire, and generally go 
out before all the carbon is consumed. The “clinkers” are found in 
our bituminous coal, and need to be burned twice in a hot fire. These 
pupils, so far as they have any influence, tend to dampen the ardor of

others. Their atmosphere is contagious, and they discourage the 
teacher and the other pupils when they are numerous in any one class. 
By the plan of frequent reclassification throughout the school, from 
the lowest class to the highest, is prevented the collection of these 
unfortunate pupils in one class. But if reclassification is carried on 
in any of the higher schools alone the result is to sift down this 
demoralized element of the school into a class by itself. Hence, when- 
ever any change is made in the higher schools, a promotion of the bril- 
liant pupils should be made from the district schools to compensate. 
(The board changed the rule for admission to the high school in Feb- 
ruary, 1873, so as to give an opportunity for thé examination of appli- 
eants for admission quarterly. This will accommodate the district 
schools perfectly. There may be enough classes found in the first and 
second grades to reduce the interval between them to one quarter. 
Moreover, in the high school the divisions of any one class may be 
separated at intervals of the same length. At least this may be done 
with the classes of the first and second years of the high school

There is needed some general plan by which the course of study in 
our higher grades may be made more elastic, better adapted to the 
capacities of pupils. The constant danger of all graded systems is that 
they are liable to become Procrustes’ beds. Take the work laid out 
for any class in our schools—it should be found exactly adapted to 
the capacities of the average pupil of the grade. The tendency of 
the teacher of energy and ability is to raise this standard up to what 
the best pupils can do and to bring sufficient pressure upon the pupils 
of average or less than average ability to compel them to keep up. 
In many instances pupils are overworked by this process. Doubt- 
less it more frequently occurs that the teacher grades her lessons by 
what,the poor scholars can do, and the best ones are not given enough 
to try their powers. In the lower grades this difficulty is not serious, 
for the reason that the work of reclassification goes on more actively. 
Tn the higher grades it is more serious, and there should be some modi- 
fication of the course of study by which pupils whose rank in the regu- 
lar course is above a certain per cent should have the privilege of elect- 
ing some one branch of study which they may earry on in the class 
above. 
[From the St. Louis School Report of 1871-72, by W. T. Harris, superintendent. } 
Whenever the sizes of the schools have been such as to admit of it, a 
system of classification has been introduced, and the immediate conse- 
quences have been: (a) great increase in the length of recitation; (b) 
far more thoroughness in the discussion of the lesson, sifting the differ- 
ent statements, and probing the meaning of the same; (c) great stimu- 
lation of the mental activity of the pupil through trial and competition 
with other members of his class. These three advantages can scarcely
-P-A-G-E-637
  CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 609 
be overestimated. They multiply the teacher’s power just as organi- 
zation improves the strength of an army. In the unclassified system 
the teacher is only a private tutor, and the fewer pupils he has the bet- 
ter for each and all. In the classified system the proper quota of pupils 
is a potent instrument in the hands of the teacher, and he uses the 
whole class to correct and stimulate each one in it. The lesson, as 
recited and discussed by and before the class, gets all its phases stated, 
restated, and criticized as never could be done in the case of a single 
pupil with a private tutor. The presence of the class arouses the 
teacher to a high pitch of energy, and each individual in the class is 
excited by the presence of the teacher and the rest of the class, These 
circumstances account for the high estimation in which the graded sys- 
tem is everywhere held. So many good things have a tendency to hide 
some very serious defects. Such defects, already alluded to in speak- 
ing of the high school, will be discussed in a summary manner here. 
The tendency of all classification is to unite pupils of widely different 
attainments. Especially is this found in the small schools. The con- 
sequence is that the lesson is too long for some and too short for others. 
The best pupils in the class are not tried to the full extent of their abil- 
ity; they consequently lose in some degree the discipline which they 
should gain. The poorest pupils of the class are strained to the utmost. 
They are dragged, asit were, over the ground without having time to 
digestit as they should. This develops the result that the overworked 
pupils are frequently discouraged and drop out of the class and likely 
enough out of the school altogether. In large systems of schools where 
classification is very perfect the evil here spoken of need not occur to a 
serious degree. But it does occur very frequently from the fact that the 
course of study is laid out in grades (ten, more or less, in number) and 
all pupils are classified or graded so that each belongs to one of these 
grades. Allthe pupils in the grade must be in the same degree of 
advancement at about the same time. The result is that the school is 
classified in such a way that there are ten classes separated by inter- 
vals of from five to ten months’ work. Then promotion is made from 
one grade to another at set times, annually or semiannually. All who 
pass the examination commence the work of the next grade; all who 
do not, continue until the next examination in the work of the grade 
through which they have just passed. 
The effect of this is well known to all teachers who have made experi- 
ments in this direction. Both parent and pupil feel very keenly the 
time lost. The pupil must have been over much of the work of the 
year, perhaps nine-tenths or three-quarters, or perhaps only one-half 
of it. Yet what he has done entitles him to an advanced position over 
his fellow-pupils of the next class below him. If he returns to school 
after being thrust back a year for his lack of less than half a year, he 
appears in the ranks of a class who were a year’s work behind him. 
He has lost his ambition; he is some time in the class before they come 
ED 92——39  
-P-A-G-E-638
  610 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
to work that is difficult enough to arouse him to the exertion of his full 
energies. Meanwhile he has lost his discipline for hard study, and he is 
very likely to break down a second time on the work of the year. A 
second failure for promotion is nearly sure to cause withdrawal from 
school. The parent has lost faith in the talent of his child and puts 
him into business or apprentices him toa trade. The youth has lost 
his own confidence in himself, and is stunted for intellectual growth for 
the rest of his life. : 
‘Was there any advantage in this kind of grading? How could it 
otherwise have transpired? Instead of the Procrustean bed of grades, 
the pupils should have been classified into classes of thirty or less each. 
These classes in all large schools would be separated by intervals of 
about five weeks’ work. As often as these classes, any of them, become 
too small by the withdrawal of pupils or too large by the assignment 
to them of newcomers, there should be a new formation of classes, 
The best pupils of one class are to be sent up to the next, the best 
from the next below are to be promoted and joined with the pupils 
remaining. Those not promoted are now united with the best of the 
class that is five weeks’ work behind them. The degradation is 
searcely felt. It is rather called, in both cases, a promotion of the best 
ones, not a degrading of the poorest. It is aprocess of cutting up the 
school into classes anew, and, as a matter of fact, the pupils need not 
have changed rooms to any very great extent. 
A set time for examination and promotion is injurious just in the 
ratio of its infrequeney. Annual examinations for promotion and a dis- 
continuance of promotions at other times is an extremely pernicious 
system, and occasions serious injury to the higher grades of our schools. 
It is evident that the further advanced the pupil the more unfavorably 
will it affect him; and yet in our schools throughout the country the 
system is so arranged that this Procrustean device applies more espe- 
cially to the advanced pupils. In how many of our cities is there pro- 
motion to the high school oftener than once per year? What becomes 
of the pupils who lack 1 per centum of making the standard required? 
Ave they not sent over the work of the highest grade of the grammar 
-schools again, and thus made to oceupy a year in doing what they 
might do in one-fourth of that time? And do they not leave school at 
this crisis more than at any other time in the whole course? Are not 
our high schools arranged in grades or classes just one year apart in 
their work? And is all this necessary? Not, certainly, where there are 
pupils enough to make two or more divisions of thirty pupils each. If 
the pupils from the highest grade of the grammar schools had been 
classified according to their rank in the examination, the first thirty 
would have formed the highest division on the high-school work, the 
next thirty the second division, and so through those who had made a 
reasonable standard. Then would have come the highest thirty pupils 
in rank of those not admitted, who should be admitted to a central 
 
-P-A-G-E-639
CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 611 
school and conditioned to five weeks’ work on the studies of the first 
grade of the grammar school, and then examined again; the next thirty 
to a longer period, and soon. Pupils thrown back five weeks, and 
then classified with their own fellows who had been unsuccessful, 
would find the hardship a very trivial one, and would scarcely think 
of leaving school. 
For schools where the number in any grade fell short of the requisite 
30 wherewith to form a new division, of course this plan of subdivision 
could not be carried out. But so far as the first [highest] grade of the 
‘grammar school is concerned this would rarely happen, and still less 
likely would it occur with classes below the highest grade. 
The principle is clearly this: Not a Procrustean bed of grades on 
which the school is to be stretched so as to reduce the number of grades 
of advancement to ten or any other special number, but a thorough 
classification of all the pupils into classes on a certain quota as a basis, 
whether-this be 30 or 25, or whatever other number is considered the 
best. The endeavor will be to have the classes separated by as small 
an interval as possible; but four, six, or even ten weeks’ work is small 
enough for all practical purposes; and in order to make this arrange- 
ment uniform the pupils in upper grades, when too few to form classes 
with the required quota, should be brought together in central schools; 
and this principle should be applied as far as possible: if the highest 
grade in the high school consisted of 60 pupils or more, the division of 
it into two classes would be required. 
This process of vontinual readjustment of classification in our schools 
will render the whole school system elastic and mobile. Like the current 
of a river there will be everywhere forward motion—in the middle the 
current is more rapid, at the sides the current flows more slowly. The 
work of the grade laid down for a year’s study will be accomplished in 
three or three and a half quarters by the brightest; by the dullest and 
slowest in five quarters. There will be no temptation to push on aslow 
pupil or drag him beyond his powers; no temptation to promote a pupil 
to a new grade’s work before thoroughly completing what is below him. 
By this plan would be checked a pernicious system of holding back 
pupils from examination for the high school, simply for the purpose of 
gaining a reputation for the school through the high per cent of its 
pupils in the competitive examination. 
Doubtless there is a certain degree of thoroughness requisite in the 
lower branches before the pupil can profitably take up the studies of 
the next higher grade. After attaining this per cent it is possible to 
keep the pupil drilling over the lower work, in order to secure a certain 
mechanical thoroughness, so long as to waste much time that might 
be better expended for the pupil’s culture and growth on the higher 
studies. 
There are still some points on which doubts may rest. For example, 
it may be urged that this system would canse a collection of the dull 
and stupid pupils into classes by themselves, a deplorable result. But  
-P-A-G-E-640
  612 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
this is one of the evils which this systen is adapted to correct. The 
fact that the best pupils from below are allowed to rise through the 
masses above them as fast as their ability can carry them is surely not 
likely to prevent the slower pupils, who are their companions, from 
exerting all their energies and making considerable progress. The 
stream of bright pupils from below isinexhaustible. From the primary 
grades it ascends, continually passing fixed points or points that move 
on more slowly. In eyery class there will be its quota of bright pupils, 
some leading the class, and some just sustaining themselves in it, 
haying recently joined it. But in the old system all the bright pupils 
had attained the top of the class and the dull ones had fallen hopelessly 
to the bottom long before the needed reclassification took place. 
Another may urge that this system causes so rapid a change from 
teacher to teacher that the very important personal influence of the 
teacher is materially impaired. But under this system in the higher 
grades the pupil would hardly change teachers oftener than once or 
twice per year, and achange as often as this is désirable for the healthy 
individual culture of the child. The school should not be a family influ- 
ence exclusively. It is the transition to civil society; consequently the 
pupil must change teachers often enough to correct any one-sided tend- 
encies of social culture that he may be liable to acquire from the indi- 
vidual teacher. For it must be remembered that reclassification of a 
whole school of 700 pupils, distributed through twelve rooms, does 
not imply a change of teachers on a part of more than one-sixth of the 
pupils, even when one-third of the best pupils in each class are pro- 
moted to the next higher. Each teacher having two classes (or, in the 
lower grades, three classes) will have one-third of the pupils from her 
advanced class promoted to the lower class in the next room above; 
she will likewise receive from the next room below one-third of the 
pupils from the advanced class there. In her own: room, one-third of 
the pupils will be promoted from her second to her first class, but will 
still remain under the same teacher. In fact, she will have promoted to 
the next room one-sixth of her pupils, and have received one-sixth from 
the next lower room—that is to say, in case one-third is promoted from 
each class; but, practically, this is themaximum, and in ordinary cases 
a less proportion of the class will be transferred. If reclassification is 
instituted four times per year, and on each occasion one-sixth of the 
pupils are promoted to the next room, it will follow that each pupil will 
be taught one year and a half by the same teacher. But,as frequent 
transfer is necessary in some schools, to make up for depletion of pupils 
in higher grades, it will happen that this period will be reduced one- 
half or two-thirds. 
In small towns where the high-school classes do not number over 
30 pupils each, such subdivision as I have here described can not be 
accomplished. But in such places there is ample occasion to apply this 
system to the district schools, which frequently suffer more than the
-P-A-G-E-641
  
CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 613 
high school from the wide intervals between the higher classes. Trans- 
fer of the same to the high school as a preparatory class, or to intermedi- 
ate schools, will be found a salutary measure. Hence, the Cincinnati 
plan of intermediate schools is an excellent one for purposes of classifica- 
tion. In small towns not only the regular high-school pupils are to be 
sent to the central institution, but also the higher grades of the district 
schools whenever the classes are too small for economical instruction. 
These may forma “preparatory department” and can be graded into 
divisions of 30 pupils each, in such a manner that there is an interval 
of ten weeks or less between each and the next higher. But whenever 
transfer and promotion take place in this school, there should be at 
the same time promotion from the grammar school in order to prevent 
the isolation of the dull pupils in the lowest class of the school; when 
the best pupils are promoted from any one division their places should 
be made good by the best pupils promoted from the class below. The 
psychological effect of successful competition has been alluded to 
before. The moderate scholars of a higher class may find themselves 
at an advantage as compared with the best pupils newly promoted 
from the class below, and are likely to take fresh courage. 
The question may arise, do these pupils who are promoted from one 
class to the next omit that portion of their studies gone over in the interval 
of time between the two classes? It is expected that this will be taken 
up by a review of the ground embraced in the mentioned interval. 
_[From the St. Louis School Report of 1872~’73, by W. T. Harris, Superintendent.) 
Last year I alluded to our plan of promotion from class to class, aid 
to the elasticity that prevails here in regard to grading. Briefly stated, 
the theory of our plan is as follows: 
1. There is great difference among pupils in the capacity to learn. 
Children who enter school at eight years of age, can, on an average, 
make nearly double the progress in primary work that pupils of five 
years of age can make. Bright, nervous children will make far more 
rapid progress than children who are stolid and dull. 
2. The school must provide for this difference in rates of progress by 
frequent reclassification; otherwise the school will become a lifeless 
machine, a Procrustean bed. It must be understood that when bright 
scholars are kept back for dull ones they acquire loose, careless habits 
of study; and when pupils of slower temperaments are strained to keep 
pace with quick and bright ones they become discouraged and demoral- 
ized. 
3. Besides difference in temperament, there is difference in regard to 
amount and regularity of attendance upon school. Some pupils are 
detained from school by sickness; some by the necessity of working for 
aliving. Three months a year is all that can be afforded by the poor- 
est people after the child is able to work. New arrivals in the city, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-642
  614 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
departures from the city, occasion a fragmentary participation in the 
privileges of the school. Moreover, it is a singular fact that nearly 
one-half of the youngest pupils begin their school life in the spring, 
having arrived at school age too late the previous fall to enter before 
the inclement weather sets in. The number of pupils belonging to the 
school at any one time, in St. Louis, is two-thirds of the entire number 
enrolled for the year. Hence the accession and loss of pupils during 
the year equal 50 per cent, or one-half of the average number belong- 
ing toschool. It should be stated that the statistics of a large majority 
of other cities show a greater fluctuation than this. The general char- 
acter of this accession and loss may be stated thus: In the lower grades 
there is continual accession, in the upper grades continual withrawal of 
pupils. 
4, Combining these two inequalities or differences with a view to 
restoring equilibrium—the continually developing difference of rate of 
progress in studies between pupils of the same class with the continu- 
ally developing inequality of size of classes (in upper grades decreasing, 
in the lower grades increasing in size)—it is evident that provision 
must be made for promotion of the pupils who make rapid progress, 
and that this promotion will, at the same time, restore the proper quota 
of pupils to the teachers of the higher grades. A promotion made once 
in ten weeks, or once in a ‘‘quarter” or ‘‘term,” will generally suffice to 
keep the school in a state of equilibrium. 
5. It is clear that frequent promotion should not be made by classes, 
The few best ones in the class should be united with the class above— 
“it will seem a reward or a recognition of their excellence. After sueh 
promotion has been made through all or nearly all of the classes from 
the lowest, each class will find itself composed of its fair, average, and 
poor scholars, together with a few of the best from the next lower class 
in place of the few that it has lost by promotion. For a while, at least, 
the average and fair scholars in the class will have the stimulus of 
being the best in the class. The poor ones will rank as “middling,” 
and the new pupils will begin as the poorest and slowly work up toward 
the top of the class. The advantage to the self-respect of the slower 
pupils which comes from standing in relation to their classmates as 
abler and better informed is not to be lost sight of. 
6. Olassification in a school is neyer absolute. No two pupils are of 
exactly the same degree of progress. The entire number in the school 
may be ranked from the highest to the lowest, and there will be found 
no wide gaps indicating a natural separation into classes, but the best 
of the next class below would stand very near the poorest of the class 
above, no matter where a division were to be made. In dividing into 
classes, therefore, the proper number in the class is first to be con- 
sidered, and next the qualifications. But it will not do, even for the 
sake of having a class of proper size, to combine pupils of widely differ-
-P-A-G-E-643

ing attainments. As indicated in the above table, the numbers in the 
various years of the course vary nearly as follows: 
           First year... --- 30 | Fifth year... 7 
Second year. Sixth year. At 
Third year .. 20 | Seventh year 2, 
Fourth year 12 | High school ... 3 
Provided the classes in the higher grades are to be of normal size, it 
is clear that the chances for proper grading are only one-seventh to one- 
tenth as good in them asin the lowest grade. The only remedy for 
this is to bring together the pupils of the higher grades into fewer 
schools, There may be very many schools with the lower four grades, 
There should be only five rooms devoted to instruction of pupils of the 
sixth year in the course where there are 30 devoted to the lowest grade, 
or 91 rooms devoted to the five lower years’ work. With us those 
schools giving instruction to pupils in the seventh or highest year of 
the district school course! are called “First class” schools. For pur- 
poses of proper grading and classification, there should be one of these 
for each district enrolling 4,000 pupils per annum, or for an average 
attendance of 2,500 pupils. Ten such schools would answer our pur- 
pose at present. As we have 15 we ought not to increase our number 
for five years. 
7. As systems of schools are generally organized, the higher priced 
and most experienced teachers have charge of the upper grades of 
pupils. As their classes suffer depletion throughout the year, unless 
there is some regular mode of transferring new pupils to the care of 
those teachers, they will have very small classes the latter half of each 
year. Thus, while the poorer class of teachers are overburdened, the 
ablest and best-paid teachers have less than their quota of pupils. It 
is clear that the policy should be to bring as many pupils as possible 
under the ablest and best-paid teachers. The practice of frequent 
transfer of pupils is better for this purpose than the custom of trans- 
ferring in bulk once per year. 
8. The system of frequent transfer does not affect the individual pupil 
any oftener, on an average, than the system of transfer once a year. 
The bright pupils, it is true, have frequent opportunity to advance. 
The system is elastic for them. The slow pupils advance only when 
ready. The system discards one general epoch of transfer and reclass- 
ification at the close of the year, and adopts instead four or more par- 
tial transfers so arranged as to accommodate the two-fold demand: 
first, that the ablest pupils shall not be kept back; second, that the 
ailenn and highest-paid teachers shall, at all ee, have their full 
tAta lato meeting of enue at western cities (held in Nov ees 1873), it 
was agreed to adopt a system of eight grades for the work of the district schools, 
each grade corresponding to a year’s work and accordingly subdivided into quarters, 
The cities of Toledo, Cleveland, Detroit, Cincinnati, Memphis, St. Louis, and Chi- 
cago have adopted this standard. 
   
-P-A-G-E-644
  616 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
quota of pupils. In the lowest grade, where several rooms in the same 
building are filled with pupils not advanced beyond the first year of 
their course, the bright pupil will change teachers perhaps three or four 
times in the year. In the higher grades the pupil will remain a year 
or more under each teacher. 
9. How to provide for the necessary process of reclassification and 
transfer from room to room with the minimum of discouragement, and 
consequent injury to that half of the pupils who fall below the average 
of attainment, is the serious question. If the sifting of cach class for 
the advantage of the best ones is accompanied with “dropping” the few 
poorest ones into the class below, we have the maximum of injury. The 
class, aS a whole, is not stimulated but only frightened at the degrada- 
tion of the few hindmost. Those actually “dropped” are really dis- 
heartened. Besides, such sifting down tends to create a movement 
toward the lower departments instead of toward the higher depart- 
ments where the vacancies are. When the opposite policy is followed, 
of promoting the few best instead of degrading the few poorest, the 
maximum of encouragement is attained. Sift up and not sift down. 
The school should be a living process, continually readjusting and 
adapting itself to the want of the organization as well as to the capac- 
ities of the pupils. 
10. How if the upper classes are quite small and yet the intervals 
are very large in regard to advancement—in other words, what if the 
‘more advanced pupils are very few? Central schools should absorb all 
the pupils of higher grade, leaving to the other schools only such grades 
as they find it possible to provide with good classification. Without 
such combination with central schools, economy and perfect classifica- 
tion are impossible. Small classes and small provision for differences 
in capacity among pupils naturally result. 
11. When promotion is made only once a year into the high school, 
the district schools are compelled to adapt their upper classes to this 
condition of things, and accordingly make the work of the first grade 
begin at the beginning of the year and end with its close. The second 
grade, likewise, must fall into the same trammels. If a class should 
finish the work of the second grade before the close of the year, it must 
not take up first grade work until the beginning of the next year, and if, 
at the commencement of the scholastic year a class of the second grade 
has not quite finished its work, itis generally put at once into the work 
of the first grade, although unprepared. The only alternative would 
be to let it work a year longer onsecond-grade studies. The utter want 
of elasticity in the classification of the upper grades of the district 
schools, arising from the lack of frequent promotions to the high school, 
works violence continually to the interests of one-third of the pupils. 
All those delayed through sickness, the necessities of poverty, or inact- 
ive temperaments, either fall back a whole year, or else in a vain 
endeavor to make up their deficiency, overwork themselves or get dis- 
couraged.
-P-A-G-E-645
  
CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 617 
12, The advantages of frequent re-classification are in brief: 
(a) ELeonomy.—Filling up the classes of the ablest and best-paid 
teachers, and making room in the lower grades for new pupils, con- 
stantly applying. , 
(b) Rapid progress.—The pupils that learn readily areallowed tomove 
forward as fast as their abilities permit, the slower pupils and those 
irregular in attendance neither allowed to hold back the more fortunate 
ones, nor obliged to overwork and cram in order to keep up. 
The disadvantages alleged are confined to the practice of changing 
teachers too frequently. To these it is sufficient to reply by a question: 
Is it desirable to keep a pupil back in his studies simply in order that 
he may recite for a long time to the same teacher? Every superinten- 
dent knows that a change of teachers brings the pupil in contact with 
a new individuality, prevents the danger of warping the development 
of character in the pupil, and is desirable oftener than once a year in 
the lower grades, and at least once a year in the higher grades—where 
the teachers are maturer and more highly cultured—until the pupil 
reaches the high school, where he recites daily to three or more teachers. 
  
  
[From the St. Louis School Report of 1873-74, by W. 'T. Harris, Superintendent.} 
  The theory of grading and classification set forth and defendedinmy 
annual report for 187172, has provoked more discussion among the 
leading educators of the country than I anticipated. Criticism has gen- 
erally been favorable, but in some quarters strong protests have been 
made against it by very intelligent men. I believe, however, that a 
complete statement of the method of reclassification, embodying all of 
its details, will prove the objections made to be groundless. I propose, 
therefore, here to present the subject anew, and endeavor to consider 
the alleged defects in a candid manner. 
At the National Educational Association in Detroit, for 1874, Hon. 
E. E. White, of Ohio, made the following statement and defense of the 
position. 
The pupils in the graded schools are divided into classes, and to secure necessary 
economy these classes are made as large as practicable. The fewer the number of 
pupils embraced in the system, the fewer must be the number of classes, and, as a 
consequence, the greater must be the inequality in the attainments and capacity of 
the members of each class, and hence the greater the difficulty of the problem now 
under consideration. If the teacher of a class adapt his instruction and require- 
ments to the maximum capacity of his pupils, the great majority are hurried over 
their studies and receive a superficial and imperfect training. If he adapt his class 
work to the minimum capacity of the class, the great majority are held back, and, as 
a consequence, not only sacrifice time and opportunity, but fall into careless and 
indolent habits of study. The remaining course is for the teacher to adapt hisclass 
work to the medium or average capacity of his pupils, with such special attention 
to the more and the less advanced pupils as may meet, to some extent, their wants. 
But here comes in the “per cent system,” with its demands.. That the class, as a 
whole, may attain a high average per cent, it is necessary that the lowest members 
of it may reach a good standard, and this results in the holding back of the bright

and industrious pupils until by iteration and reiteration the dull and indolent may 
be brought to the required standard. The amount of time and talent thus wasted 
in somo graded schools is very great, This is not always evident to the teacher, 
since the brightest pupils, being chained to the dullest, soon learn to keep step, 
scarcely showing their ability to advance more rapidly, This difficulty is greatly 
aggravated when classes are promoted en masse from grade to grade, the pupils being 
thus chained to each other year after year, or throughout the course—an efficient 
process for reducing pupils to the level of mediocrity. 
The statement of these difficulties suggests their partial remedy. The brighter 
and more capable pupils in each class must have the opportunity to work away from 
the less capable, and to step forward intoa higher class, when the difference between 
them and their lower classmates becomes too great for a profitable union in the same 
class. To this end there must be a proper interval between the successive classes, 
and the reclassification of pupils must be made with corresponding frequency. 
Experience alono can determine what this interval should be, and the frequency 
with which pupils should be promoted. It is possible that both of these facts may 
depend somewhat on the number of pupils included in a graded system, amuch more 
complete classification being possible in large cities than in small towns, While 
this may be true, it is believed by many experienced superintendents and other intel- 
ligent observers, that the universal experience of graded schools condemns the prey- 
alent practice of promoting pupils but once a year, with a year’s interval between 
the classes. This wide interval isa serious obstacle in the way of a needed reclassi- 
fication of pupils. The more capable pupils can not be transferred to a higher class, 
since this obliges them to go over the ground of two years in one—a task success- 
fully performed by very few pupils—and the less advanced pupils can not be put 
back into a lower class without serious loss in timo and ambition, if they are not 
. Withdrawn from school. It may be well for a few pupils in any system of graded 
schools to spend an entire year in reviewing the previous year’s work, but these 
exceptional cases are usually the result of anunwise attempt to hold pupils too long 
together. Large classes of young pupils can not be kept together, even for one year, 
without serious loss both to those who aro held back and to those who are unduly 
hurried. What is needed is a system of classification and promotion that shall pro- 
vide for the breaking of classes, at least twice a year, with a transfer of the more 
advanced pupils, and their union with the less advanced pupils of the next higher 
class, and also with special transfers of bright pupils from class to class as often as 
may be necessary, and special provisions for pupils deficientin some branch of study. 
We are aware that the system of annual promotions has special advantages. It 
reduces the number of classes in the smaller cities and towns, and it saves labor and 
trouble, especially when classes are promoted in.a body, on a minimum standard. It 
is undoubtedly true that a Procrustean system, which puts pupils in classes, reduces 
them to the same capacity, and moyes them regularly and evenly forward, requires 
little skill to run it, but this can not compensate for the serious losses involved. The 
highest good of pupils ought never tosbe sacrificed to secure a seft-adjusting 
mechanism and uniformity of results. 
  Superintendent Stevenson, of Columbus, Ohio, in his report for 
1873~74, discusses the question in an attitude somewhat hostile to the 
plan of frequent reclassification. He says: 
The course of study assumes one year for the completion of the studies in each 
grade, and an annual transfer of pupils from grade to grade. The amount of work 
to be done each year is the maximum for the pupils of average capacity whose 
attendance upon the school is the average number of days a child of ordinary health 
may be present during the year. Dull scholars often make up what is lostin natural 
ability by regular attendance and industry, and bright scholars lose by irregularity 
of attendance and indolence what they gain by quickness to learn, so that the

larger number of promotions can bo and are justly and satisfactorily mado at the 
close of the year. 
But differences in the ages and the capacity of children entering the school must, 
in many cases, be provided for in the classification. To make such provision no 
classification can be absolute; it must undergo changes from the beginning to the 
end of the year. A child of 10 years of age having a healthy body and vigorous 
mind will do mere, or is capable of doing more study than a feeble child of 8 
years of age; and a bright child whose parents take some pains in home training, 
who is regular in his attendance, will do much more in a year than the dull child 
who is neglected at home, and whose attendance is interfered with by the necessi- 
ties at home, or by bad health. It is also true, that pupils of the greatest ability 
have frequently less power of application than those less brilliant. Whatone gains 
by ability, the others gain by industry and effort. For example, ability is equalized 
by industry ; regular attendance, by irregular; health, by illness; age, by home train- 
ing; attention, by inattention. These are important factors which must be consid- 
ered in the solution of the great problem of classification. 
By observing closely the progress of children in public schools for a series of years, 
I have arrived at the following results: In a graded school in which the course of 
study is made for the average pupil, about 5 per cent will show strength enough to 
be advanced during the year, and about 10 per cent will fall behind the remaining 
95 per cent oftheclass. This varies a little in the lower and higher grades, but it is 
a fair and approximately correct average for a course of study requiring eight years 
for its completion. The question then is, What is to be done with this 15 per cent 
of scholars? Every teacher will answer, let the 5 per cent go to the next higher 
grade, and do not permit the 10 per cent to interfere with the progress of the class. 
Five per cent of the 10 can, without injury to themselves, by a little extra effort, be 
worked up to the proper standard, and the remaining 5 per cent ought for their own 
good to pass over the work of the grade again, or so much of the work as will pre- 
pare for the next higher. I can not condemn in too strong terms the recommenda- 
tion of those theorists who would gather into one class or grade all the bright ones, 
and the dull ones into another; that is, make the basis of classification upon the 
estimated ability of the pupils, rather than upon what they do, for it is the rule, 
rather than the exception, that the dull scholars win the race in the long run. The 
separation of the dull and bright scholars into different classes is unjust and injuri- 
ous—unjust, because the keenest discrimination can not always discover the slum- 
bering mental power of many children, nor ascertain the outside influences which 
detract from the manifestations of intellectual ability by the child; injurious, because 
the dull scholars are deprived of the highest possible standard by which to measure 
themselves intellectually, and the competition which is necessary to excite interest 
and enthusiasm. To meet this theory, viz, that the bright scholars should not be 
chained to the dull ones, promotions of classes in many schools are made semi- 
annually. The arguments {in favor of frequent promotions are, first, the interval 
between the classes being short, those who fail to reach the required standard for 
promotion will lose less time; second, it gives an opportunity to the bright and 
industrious scholars to break away from their dull and indolent associates; third, 
it brings the scholars in contact with a greater number of teachers. The objections 
to frequent promotions by classes are: First, frequent changes of teachers; second, 
the best interests of the majority are sacrificed for the benefit ofa very small minority ; 
third, there isno real advantage gained for those who are promoted, either in time or 
opportunity, for more rapid advancement. These objections are worthy of careful 
consideration. The teacher, in an interval much shorter than a year, can not become 
acquainted with the individuality of her pupils, their strong and weak points, their 
susceptibilities, their physical and intellectual powers, and the outside forces, which 
more or less control their education and character. The teacher ought to know her 
pupils thoroughly. This takes time. Will not children do better work and make

  620 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
more rapid progress with a teacher who has had time enough to win their confidence 
and love, than they would with one whose name they scarcely know, and whose 
warm sympathy they have never felt? 
Why make a reclassification of 1 whole school three or four times a year, because 
15 per cent have failed to reach a fixed standard at the end of every three, four, or 
six months, to the disadvantage of the 85 per cent? The amount of work to be done 
by the pupil in a year is the same, whether it is divided into quarters, halves, or a 
year, with a promotion at the end of each period. 
The plan of promotions in the schools of this city has been by classes annually, 
except in the lowest, primary grade, in which promotions are made semiannually, 
to accommodate the new pupils entering in the spring, and by individuals at any 
time during the term, whenever they are found qualified fora higher grade. A pupil 
passing into a higher grade at the end of five months, finds no difficulty in making 
up the subjects omitted in connection with the reviews of the class, if ho is apt and 
diligent. In the practical working of a system of schools, this plan secures all the 
advantages of frequent promotions with none of the disadvantages of the plan of 
yearly transfers. In short, it has all the flexibility that the varying circumstances 
and the differences in children require. 
His condemnation of the theory or system which brings together all 
the bright ones into classes by themselves, and collects the dull ones 
in a similar manner, is not too strong, in my opinion. I have seen the 
bad effects of this often. He limits his objection to the system of 
reclassification recommended here by specifying ‘‘ promotion by classes.” 
In my discussion of the subject last year, I remarked, in view of much 
evidence of misunderstanding on this point (Report, 1872~73, p. 25, 
section 5): 
It is clear that frequent promotion should not be made by classes. The few best 
ones in the classes should be united with the class above—it willseem a reward or a 
recognition of their excellence. After such promotion has been made through all or 
nearly all of the classes from the lowest, each class will find itself composed of its 
fair, average, and poor scholars, together with a few of the best from the next lower 
class in the ‘place of the few that it has lost by promotion. For a while, at least, 
the average and fair scholars in the class will have the stimulus which arises from 
the consciousness of being the best in the class. The poor ones will rank as ‘mid- 
dling,” and the new pupiis will begin as the poorest and slowly work up toward the 
top of the class. 
It seems that in Columbus about 5 per cent of the pupils “show 
strength enough to be advanced during the year.” One in every twenty 
pupils has so strong need of promotion that it is found best to place 
him in the class above, although that class is a full year in advance. 
If so many are benefited by a leap over so large an interval, it 1s diffi- 
cult to see why 10, 20, or 30 per cent of the pupils could not be profited 
by promotions to classes thirty, twenty, or ten weeks in advance. And 
if 10 per cent fall behind into classes a year lower in the course of 
of study, it admits of doubt whether they and many more besides 
would not have been better provided for by assigning them to classes 
ten or twenty weeks lower in the course. The other objections will be 
noticed in their proper place. 
_ It will be noted that Mr. Stevenson believes in promoting “by 
classes, annually (semiannually in the lowest primary grade), and by
-P-A-G-E-649
  CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 621 
individuals at any time during the term, whenever they are found 
qualified for a higher grade.” “Promoting by classes” evidently 
refers to changing the work of the class from the course of study laid 
down for one year or grade to the work of the next year or grade, 
while “by individuals” refers to actual reclassification. 
“Promotion by classes ” may be from day to day, or month to month, 
or year to year, or once in four years, according to the arbitrary stand- 
ard of division adopted by the one who makes out his course of study. 
‘Whenever the teacher sets a new lesson she promotes “by class” to a 
new stage in the course of study. Whenever one ten weeks’ work is 
accomplished, and a new one begins, there is a promotion “ by class,” 
although neither the teacher nor the pupils make any note of it. The 
course of study with us is subdivided so as to show the average amount 
of work for ten weeks. Many years ago no accurate measure of the 
time required to go over the course of study in its various stages was 
kept in this city, and as a consequence the expression “ promotion by 
class” would not have been used with reference to entering upon the 
work of a new year, but might have been applied to the promotion of 
a class to a new text book, or from one school building to another, or 
from one room to another in the same school, or, finally, from the dis- 
trict school to the high school. Possibly, also, ‘“ promotion by class” 
refers to the change of teacher, in Columbus. But at all events, it is 
not “reclassification” in the sense that term is used in this report. 
The promotion “ by individuals,” since it must refer to a change from 
one class to another, ¢s a reclassification, and this must happen quite 
frequently even in a school where only 15 per cent of the pupils are 
thus changed in the course of a year. 
Superintendent Stone, of Springfield, Mass., presents. his view of this 
matter, in his report for 1874, thus: 
The perfection of school organization, as I understand it, is reached when every 
pupil has a chance to do his best. This can be accomplished only by judicious grad- 
ing; but schools are frequently graded so mechanically that they fall far short of 
the highest efficiency. In this way arises the objection, sometimes made, that work 
in graded schools is slow, and that pupils are not unfrequently hindered, rather than 
carried forward, in their progress. It must be acknowledged that unless grading is 
done strictly according to proficiency and ability, the advantages claimed for it are 
not attained. The mistake most frequently made in grading a school is in suppos- 
ing that a class once formed can be continued, for a considerable length of time, 
without any promotions or other changes. It can hardly be expected that 50 pupils, 
even of similar proficiency, at the commencement of a school year, can be placed in 
a room and kept profitably employed there for a twelvemonth upon the same amount 
of school work. A difference in ability will soon develop itself, and thenif the rate 
of progress is graduated to the average, or, as is sometimes done, to the minimum 
capacity of the class, those who are able to do more will soon find themselves with 
considerable unoccupied time upon their hands. Such a result is especially to be 
deprecated; for it is an important principle to be borne in mind that pupils do not 
study to the best advantage, nor accomplish their greatest and best work, unless they 
feel the necessity of constant effort. They ought not to be hurried, but they should 
fee] that they can not be idle without incurring the danger of falling into the ranks of
-P-A-G-E-650
  622 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
the laggards and the drones. Persons of active minds must have employment of 
some kind, and if they do not find sufficient legitimate work in school, they often, 
from mere restlessness, occasion the teacher much trouble in the way of discipline, 
or become disgusted, and leave school altogether. Their minds are dwarfed if they 
remain under such circumstances; they have little enjoyment in their work, and it 
is not strango they lose their patience and their interest. 
Various plans are proposed and tried for the solution of this difficulty. That of 
dividing and subdividing pupils of a single room into numerous small classes is, 
perhaps, the most objectionable, the time allowed to be devoted to each els 
wholly insufficient for anything like thorough and satisfactory work. 
Another plan is an entire reconstruction and classification of all the grades four 
times ayear. Whatever may be said in favor of such a course, neither theory nor 
practice gives it a strong indorsement. While it may bring those of the same pro- 
ficiency together at cach classification, aterm of ten weeks does not allow sufficient 
acquaintance to be formed between teacher and pupil to enable both to work to the 
best advantage before a recast of the school introduces a new class, or one for the 
most part new. Such frequent changes are found to produce constant confusion, and 
the advantages of continuous methodical work are almost entirely lost. 
Our own schools, as I regard them, seem to need a more discriminating classifi- 
cation at the commencement of the school year, and afterwards more frequent 
individual promotions. When a class is formed every pupil should be placed there 
who is able or who can possibly be induced to do the work of the class, no matter 
how many grades such pupils overleap or what may be their ages. As the class 
progresses, those who seem capable of advancing faster and are willing to make an 
extra effort should from time to time, be promoted to the next higher class or 
grade, provided that it seems probable that such pupils can bridge over the inter- 
val thus passed in a reasonable length of time. Where such opportunities for pro- 
“notion are constantly before the school a laudable ambition for respectable progress 
is kept up and more and better work is accomplished. At the commencement of 
the spring term, in April, a reclassification of the lower primary grades may be 
desirable, as a considerable accession of new pupils is made at that time to those 
schools. I would also advise that, at the same time, three months before the close 
of the year a thorough examination be made, in the upper grades of the grammar 
schools, of those individual cases who seem capable of advancement, that they may 
be allowed promotion, and thereby gain a year in their course, especially when the 
age of the pupil seems to render such a step desirable. 
Such a system of classification and promotion, carefully watched and carried as 
far as the health and ability of the pupil will admit, and assuredly no further, will, 
I feel confident, greatly increase the efficiency of schools. In this way many a dis- 
heartened pupil will be incited to interest and effort; many who have despaired of 
promotion will look forward with hope; many who have anticipated leaving school 
in the middle grades will be induced to go further; and many, very many I hope, 
will be able and willing to go beyond the grammar-school grade, and join the classes 
in the high school—the highest public educational good in our city now within 
reach of its children and youth. 
  ss being 
The plan of “dividing and subdividing the pupils of a single room 
into numerous small classes,” spoken of above as the “most objec- 
tionable,” is the plan adopted in ungraded schools and for the numer- 
ous’ class of small country schoels. While the plan is very objec- 
tionable, it is difficult to suggest anything better for the small schools 
in thinly settled districts of the country. In the lowest primary 
classes of a city school, where the recitation should not exceed twenty 
minutes in length, the teacher may profitably divide her sixty pupils 
 
-P-A-G-E-651
  
CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 623 
into three or even four classes. But in the grammar school there 
should not be more than two classes of twenty-four pupils each. 
“ Reclassification of all the grades four times in a year,” if it had the 
effect described, of changing at each time the majority of the pupils 
from one teacher to another, would certainly fail of “strong indorse- 
ment,” or at least ought to fail of it. When we read, however, of the 
“frequent individual promotions” and of the “reclassification of the 
lower primary grades” at the commencement of the spring and fall 
terms, we find that the kind of “reclassification” we advocate here is 
practiced and strongly indorsed in Springfield. 
The school committee of Worcester, Mass., present the following 
remarks on this topic in their recent report on the suggestions made 
by the mayor of that city: 
It should also be borne in mind that any system of grading is necessarily imper- 
fect. The differences between our scholars are not a series of regular and abrupt 
steps according to the theory of our grades. There are wide differences of attain- 
ment by study of physical and mental capacity and of disposition and home influ- 
ence. In truth, these differences might be more fittingly compared to the slope of a 
mountain ridge than to either a stairway or an inclined plain; and, if we rightly 
understand the remarks of the mayor, it is these differences that form the basis of 
his criticism upon our system of grading. But precisely the same criticism may be 
made upon the ordinary classification of scholars in an ungraded school; and until 
the city of Worcester can afford to furnish to each scholar a private tutor especially 
adapted to the scholar’s needs, we are not prepared to recommend the abolition of 
grading and classification in our schools. 
Butit isno doubt true that a series of graded schools needs constant supervi 
and regrading. Many teachers seem unwilling to promote their best scholars except 
at the termination of the year, and, therefore, some special provision for discovery of 
cases of exceptional merit and their more rapid advancement is necessary. 
The ordinary and regular operation of our system results in the promotion or 
advancement of the scholars one grade each year. The average Worcester scholar 
performs the work assigned for him to do with an indifferent sort of success and is 
regularly promoted. 
But there are cases of exceptional dullness and absence, whero the work is not 
done; and there are exceptional cases of meritorious achievement, when promotions 
might and ought to be made more rapidly than our system in its ordinary working 
provides for, Itis the latter which we suppose the mayor to have had in mind when 
he called attention to semiannual promotions, Agreeing with the spirit rather than 
the strict letter of his recommendation, we favor promotions in cases of exceptional 
merit, at whatever time of year it may be discovered, and recommend the breaking 
of all rules, if need be, to get at them and do justice by them. 
When the present plan of placing each school building under charge of one mas- 
ter or principal was adopted, if was expected that the principals, having all the 
scholars in the building directly under their own eye, would readily discover and 
rapidly advance superior merit. Has this expectation been as fully borne out by 
results as we had right to hope it would be? Do the principals make themselves 
personally as familiar with the scholarship of each scholar as they might and ought? 
It seems to us that we have a right to expect that all principals having an assistant 
in their own room will make frequent visits to each room, hear recitations, and give 
instruction in each, and make personal examination to such an extent as to become 
perfectly familiar with the attainments of every scholar, and be prepared at any 
time to advance the deserving. It is believed that they have abundant time to do 
this. 
   
-P-A-G-E-652
  624 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
We have in mind the case of six scholars at the beginning of the present year pro- 
moted from the sixth to the eighth grade, and to-day they are among the very best 
scholars of that grade. Nothing can be more certain than that it would have been 
a great injustice to have kept back those six scholars in the seventh grade during 
the present year. z 
The provisions of Chapter vit of the rules and regulations of this board well define 
the duties and confer ample powers upon ‘principals and assistants” with regard 
to promotions, and the only change we see reason to recommend is the addition of a 
rule requiring assistants to make reports to principals, and principals to superin- 
tendents, at tho end of each term, whether there are any scholars in their school 
that ought to be promoted, and, ifso, why they are not promoted. 
Superintendent Harrington, of New Bedford, attacks very earnestly 
the proposed plan of reclassification and takes a far more radical posi- 
tion of hostility than any other opponent. His first and chief objection 
to the system is against the supposed frequent change ‘of teachers 
necessitated by it, and the consequent injury to the thoroughness of 
the instruction and the healthfulness of the discipline. He very justly 
contends that the teacher must have time to get acquainted with his 
pupils, and to plan and carry out a systematic whole of methods and 
processes carefully arranged, so as to produce important mental and 
moral results. Perhaps a sufficient reply to this will be found in the 
subsequent demonstration of the fact that the change of teachers need 
not and does not occur any oftener under this system than under the 
system its opponents advocate. But Mr. Harrington seems, like some 
other opponents, to understand the effect of ‘reclassification four 
times a year” to be the change of teachers four times a year. With 
such a mistaken view of the system one can not be surprised that he 
opposes it. But he proceeds to indicate his hostility to all systems “in 
which promotions make one of the customary instrumentalities of 
influence and progress.” “The course of study,” according to him, 
should be “so adjusted as to meet the intellectual demands of a scholar 
at every step of his progress, following him along until, at 14 years of 
age, he has compassed a full schedule of elementary study.” “Although 
the well-constructed manual of study presents only the minimum of 
requirement,” he asks: “ Do we not expect that minimum to serve only 
as a skeleton, which the teacher is to clothe with flesh and blood, and 
round out into full proportions, so as to meet the expectations of the 
ambitious, satisfy the cravings of the intellectual, and occupy the time 
of the most proficient?” ‘The school in which promotions are a cus- 
tomary instrumentality must be addressing itself all the time to medi- 
ocrity alone, on a comparatively low level of purpose without stimuli 
to create a healthful esprit de corps, and wanting in the characteristics 
of vigorous, intellectual life.” ‘‘Promotions are not provided for in 
our system—are not asked for—could have no legitimate place. The 
best scholars, all throughout our grades, find constant and delightful 
occupation.” 
By this we are to understand that a vastly superior plan to the one 
which sifts and classifies and is attentive to close grading has been dis-
-P-A-G-E-653
  CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. L625 
eovered, and this plan makes pupils and parents indifferent to the grad- 
ing and classification of the school. It makes no difference how une- 
qual the powers of those who are in the same class—the gifted and 
mature pupil can use his time in full, while the poorest pupil does as 
much. “This condition of things, rendering it possible to occupy the 
time of the superior scholars in fruitful study, and also to give the 
poorer ones a good wholesome stint which they can accomplish without 
any undue strain or forcing, while all at the same time work together 
as a class, is brought about by an adjustment of the studies, which 
may be described in a homely way as ‘a circle within a circle.’ Theinner 
circle represents the essential fundamental work which is prescribed 
to be thoroughly accomplished by all the class. The outer circle repre- 
sents a broader field of study, either illustrative of or supplementary 
to that of the inner circle which all are expected nominally to engage 
in, but from any test work as to which, the weaker-minded can quietly be 
released just in proportion to their incompetency to master it.” 
I have italicized the last clause in order to draw special attention to 
it. ‘The result,” he continues, ‘amply justifies our method. It is as 
admirable as it is astonishing to find, by letting the poor scholars work 
along side by side with their original mates, not souring them by rebuffs, 
not destroying their self-respect or paralyzing their ambition by keeping 
them back, how much they will gradually acquire; how often, indeed, 
their indifference becomes charmed away, their dormant faculties aroused 
to activity, and an honorable career substituted for one of neglect and 
demerit.” Finally, he concludes that the best plan is “to continue 
the class of scholars under the selfsame teacher through all the four 
years of progress, after entering the grammar school, up to the gradu- 
ating grade.” He intimates that the schools under his charge “ have 
comparatively little to do with percentages. We do not believe in 
them in connection with either large schools or little schools. We 
believe that a system of marking and per cents exerts a depressing 
influence over school work. We have stated written examinations 
(four times a year) at which, for specific purposes, the papers are 
marked and the per cents obtained. Beyond that we trust in less arti- 
ficial stimuli to give spirit and life to our schools.” 
The repudiation of all class records by which the individual pupil 
and his parents can be provided periodically with a faithful statement 
of the amount of work done by said pupil, would seem to be quite in 
harmony with the system described as existing in New Bedford. While 
Iam far from denying that the “let alone” (laissez faire) theory of 
school management will permit some very good work to exist, my expe- 
rience with very much of itin my youth, beginning with the “red 
school house” in the woods and extending through several of the pri- 
vate schools called “ academies,” forces me to say that I believe that 
under it there is a wholesale slaughter of the time and opportunity of 
well-disposed youth. I shall never forget the epoch made in my life

upon emerging from this régime and entering the Phillips Academy at 
Andover, then under Dr. 8. H. Taylor. Here a class record was kept, 
and students were held accountable for the use of their time and oppor- 
tunities. I can not but believe that the system practiced at Andover 
does the utmost to develop responsible beings, and to transmute the 
pulpy substance of impulse and inclination—the undisciplined will— 
into a self-controlled will, a directive intelligence that can reinforce the 
moments by the hours, and accomplish something in the world. Most 
persons that I have known brought up under the laissez faire system 
have seemed to lapse away in after life and recede from the promise 
which their school life gave, while the strong characters have emanated 
from the throng of those who were held to a strict responsibility in 
their school life. A system which classifies the weak and incom- 
petent with the strong and genial minded, and when they diverge in 
the amount of work accomplished under its instruction—as they cer- 
tainly will diverge under any instruction which is anything other than 
an opiate, a paralyzer of the will—still retains them in the same class 
and relaxes its hold so as to release the weak from the normal responsi- 
bility, will be found in nearly every case to be productive of injury to 
the growth of character in both weak and strong. If pupils of all 
classes are to be held to a strict accountability for their work there 
must be a careful system of: classification. 
I am aware of the difficulty of making any statements regarding 
schools without the probability of being misunderstood, even by those 
well versed in educational affairs. When we undertake to describe a 
system or method, we assume a certain status of things as existing; 
probably we take for granted that the reader or listener has in mind 
the organization of the schools in which we are working. If the reader 
or listener happens to be acquainted with a radically different system 
only, his attempt to construe our words results in ludicrous misconcep- 
tions. Few people have any adequate idea of the diversity that really 
exists in our public educational systems in the United States. Not to 
speak of the difference of public school methods from those of private 
or parochial schools, one may find variety enough within the public 
schools to explain how such misunderstandings arise. It is not suffi- 
cient to state a system in words which have become technical in a par- 
tieular locality. The reader of a different locality will read such words 
attentively, but will put his own construction upon them. An example 
of this has been seen in the different interpretations given to the words 
“promotion” and “reclassification,” used by different writers in differ- 
ent senses, and sometimes by the same writer in the same sentence in two 
meanings. “ Promotion” may mean change of class (a) from one book 
to a higher one; or (b) from one room to another; or (c) from one 
teacher to another; or (d) from one school to another; or (e) from the 
quantum of work prescribed for one limited time (primary or grammar 
department, year or grade, term or quarter, week, or single lesson). Or,

again, it may refer to the change of a pupil from a lower class to a more 
advanced one, ete. ‘ Reclassification” may be used to signify some one 
of many phases appertaining to the organization of a school. The 
transfer of a single pupil from one class to a higher or lower one is a 
reclassification. It is not strictly correct to apply the term reclassifica- 
tion to the transfer of a whole class from one school, teacher, room, 
book, or grade of work to another; and yet much confusion arises from 
such application. 
In order, therefore, to make this discussion explicit, it will be neces- 
sary to have constant reference to systems that stand in contrast to 
our own, while we are attempting to give an account of it in a report. 
1. The germinal school organization out of which all varieties have 
grown is the country school of one room and one teacher, with from ten 
to 60 or more pupils of all ages and degrees of advancement, from 
the stripling of 4 years, who begins at the alphabet, up to the young 
man of 21, who is likely to study algebra, or Latin, or natural phi- 
losophy. The difference in qualifications ranges through cight or 10 
years of study. If classes are to be made they are likely to be made 
on the accidental fact that some of the pupils bring to school the same 
text books; in the same arithmetic, the same reader, or geography, or 
grammar, a class being formed with very little regard to the difference 
in advancement of its members. Not seldom it happens that those of 
like advancement in the country school happen to have different text 
books, and for that reason alone are assigned to different classes and 
mated with other pupils of very inferior attainments, who have the 
same book. Thus it happens that the function of the teacher in the 
country school becomes chiefly one of keeping order and hearing les- 
sons, without being able to find time to teach or explain anything, or to 
become acquainted with the obstacles that arise in the minds of his 
pupils. His number of recitations per day averages from twenty-five 
to fifty, and their length varies from two minutes to twenty or thirty, but 
averaging only five or ten minutes apiece. But the same teacher may 
remain in the school for years, although this is not usually the case. 
The pupils then may avoid, frequent changes of teachers. A pupil 
might spend several years under the same teacher. There is no division 
of labor in this rudimentary type of school, and it is obvious that the 
continuance under the same te cher possesses but little more advan- 
tage than the antiquated process by which a gun was made through- 
out—lock, stock, and barrel—by one gunsmith, has over the division- 
of-labor system in the Springfield Armory, or the watch manufactories 
at Waltham or Elgin, where cach manipulation has a different work- 
man to perform it. With small schools of this character which range 
through so wide differences in age and acquirements in their pupils, but 
little can be done other than to secure discipline, and lay special stress 
upon individual industry. Uniformity of text books (now generally 
established by State laws) renders possible some degree of classifica- 
tion, but at best, such classification is very imperfect for the rea- 
se a Nile eT!
-P-A-G-E-656
  628 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
son that there can be little transferring from one class to another in 
ease of differences of ability. 
2. When the country school grows to be a village school, and the 
_ number of pupils increases to 60 or 100, two rooms are opened and two 
teachers employed. Division of labor may begin here. Primary and 
grammar department is instituted, and the range of acquirement in 
each room may be four years by the course of study. Fewer classes 
and larger ones allow the teacher twice the length of time for each recita- 
tion, and he can begin to lay some stress on instruction. The advantages 
of class recitation over individual instruction begin to appear at this 
point. Individual instruction is good where the teacher can devote to 
it as much time as to an ordinary recitation, but it is inferior to class reci- 
tationeven then. The class should consist of notless than 10 nor more 
than 30. The length of recitation should vary from fifteen or twenty 
minutes in the primary grades, to thirty or forty minutes in the gram- 
mar department. During recitation there should be the most vivid and 
constant attention on the part of all the pupils. It isobvious that this 
ean be obtained in the primary grades only for a short time. With 
increasing discipline and the strength that comes of years’ practice, the 
recitation hour can be lengthened. That a properly conducted class 
recitation is of far greater value than individual instruction, is obvious 
from the consideration that the contents of the lesson are stated over 
and over by different pupils of the class, criticised and discussed, illus- 
trated from the experience of different pupils, and the pupil has the 
advantage of seeing how his fellows encounter and surmount such diffi- 
culties as he himself meets. What we see in the experience of others, 
our equals, becomes at once our experience by adoption, and it saves 
us from the pain and consumption of time necessary to acquire its wis- 
dom through personal adventure. Hence education is essentially to be 
carried on in the form of community. The school is and must bea 
community; no private tutoring can educate as the schoolcan. But it 
is evident that the school best subserves this purpose, when it classi- 
fies so that each one meets his equals in the recitation. Great inferior- 
ity or great superiority in his fellows, mars the force of the lesson which 
he learns from seeing their work. 
The village school of two rooms, as contrasted with the country school 
of one room, exhibits to us the beginnings of classification and proper 
recitation. It does hardly more than this. Its separation of the four 
years of primary work from the four years of grammar school work is 
a great, but only one, step. 
3. When a village comes to have 500 or 1,000 children living within 
a small area so that they can be brought into a central school of eight to 
twenty rooms, new developments become possible in grading and classi- 
fication. Usually the primary work is kept localized in small schools, 
while only the advanced pupils are brought together into the central 
school, This is just and proper. The ratio of younger pupils to older 
ones islarge. In St. Louis there were last year in every 100 pupils, 37
-P-A-G-E-657
  CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS 629 
in the first year’s work; 17 in the second year; 164 in the third year; 
12 in the fourth year; 7 in the fifth year; 44 in the sixth year; 3 in the 
seventh year, and 3 in the entire four years’ course of the high school. 
Counting the lowest three years of the course as primary work, we have 
over 70 per cent of all the pupils in the schools in the primary depart- 
ment, and only about 26 per cent in the grammar department. In 
Eastern cities, where education for a long time has done its work, the 
ratio is much more favorable to the higher departments than with us. 
From these facts it is clear that in order to secure as good results in 
classification of grammar school pupils, as with primary pupils, the 
former must be brought together in about one-fourth as many schools 
as the latter. To explain: There are, in the school children of a given 
community, about one-half as many in the grammar school department 
as in the primary. The recitations of the primary pupils should be 
about two-thirds the length of those in the grammar department, by 
reason of the undisciplined power of attention of the former. The num- 
ber of recitations in the primary department will average three-fourths 
of the number to each class in the grammar department. Hence it is 
that the number of pupils to each teacher in the grammar department 
ifiust be considerably less—two-thirds of the number assigned to each 
teacher in the primary department. The teacher in the primary de- 
partment can manage and instruct 72 pupils with greater efficiency 
than the teacher of the grammar department can manage 48 pupils. 
In the small primary schools located in the different neighborhoods, — 
therefore, the primary teacher may easily manage three or four classes 
of pupils. These may represent a difference in advancement twice as 
great as that in any single room of the grammar department. 
The question of the proper number of classes to be assigned to a 
teacher arises in this grade of schools. No one would think of organiz- 
ing a country school or the 2-room village school on the basis of one 
class toa room. It is first in the central or “ graded” school, with its 
8 to 12 rooms, that the question of reducing the classes in number so 
that each teacher shall have charge of one only. According to our St. 
Louis system the teachers in the grammar department (fifth, sixth, sev- 
enth, and eighth years of the pupil’s course at school) have two classes 
each, and one is engaged in study while the other recites. In the pri- 
mary department three and even four small classes are formed by the 
teacher of each room. In these remarks it is taken for granted that 
the style of building is not the old-fashioned type of a large study room, 
presided over by a principal, and with small recitation rooms opening 
out from it, in which the assistants hear the classes recite, when sent 
to them from the large room. This type of schoolhouse, invented for 
the purposes of the Lancasterian system has gone out of date. Since 
1848 the plan has been adopted of assigning each teacher a room about 
32 feet square, with 48 to 64 pupils, who do not leave the room for study 
or recitation, both being conducted by the teacher in charge of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-658
  630 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
room. The gain in humanizing the pupils and in rendering a milder 
discipline possible has been very great under this system. Formerly 
the assistant teachers had little to do with the discipline, which was 
done almost entirely by the principal, who, on the other hand, not 
learning to know the pupils through their recitations, had to govern 
them through external authority rather than through the subtle influ- 
ences which one can wield who knows the characters of his pupils thor- 
oughly. The objections to the plan of having only one class under each 
teacher are these: (a) It makes the class too large, so that either the 
recitation must be too long or else its members can not all share in 
the recitation; (b) it wastes the possibilities of classification by requir: 
ing the whole room to take the same lessons, when, if divided into two 
classes, one in advance of the other, the class intervals could be lessened 
one-half throughout the whole school, and as a consequence transfer 
from one class to another be rendered easier; (¢c) itis apt to destroy the 
force of the recitations, because the teacher, while not hearing a reci- 
tation, is helping scholars to learn their lessons or solve difficulties, 
and thus, to a greater or less extent, distracting the attention of the 
pupils from work which they ought to perform by themselves, and with 
all possible self-concentration and self-reliance—the consequence being 
that the work of criticism and analyses that should come up in the 
recitation is anticipated by the ill-timed assistance of the teacher dur- 
ing study hours; hence a tendency to obliterate the lines between study 
hour and recitation hour, and to confound them. 
If, then, we suppose that our village “graded school” is organized 
so as to give each teacher a room with two classes, the class intervals 
will be about as follows: Eight rooms devoted to grammar-school work 
(the second four years’ course for the district schools), and 400 pupils 
in attendance; of these pupils one class would be in the eighth or last 
year of the course—30 pupils; three classes in the seventh year, the 
advanced class one-half year behind the highest class in school, the 
second and third classes, respectively, in the first and second quarters 
of the seventh year’s course—70 pupils; four classes in the sixth year’s 
work, one in each quarter’s work of the course—110 pupils; seven 
classes in the fifth year’s work, the class intervals being from five to 
~ ten weeks—190 pupils. 
The following scheme would indicate the rooms, classes, and grade of 
advancement of the pupils in this “ graded school:”

We have not indicated a high-school course in this school system. 
Its normal size would be about 70 pupils. These dividing into four 
classes to correspond to the four years’ course, could not be subdivided, 
for subdivision of classes ought not to take place unless the number in 
the class is greater than 30, except in those cases where the class inter- 
vals would be greater than one year. In the above graded school 
course, perhaps it would be found necessary to subdivide the class of 
30 who are in the eighth year or grade. 
In order to explain my use of the technical expressions “ year” and 
“quarter,” I will state that at the National Educational Association in 
August, 1874, a conventional grading scheme was adopted by the school 
superintendents in order to measure the progress in the course of study, 
and afford a convenient es for eSpreae. it.

4, They per cent of pupils i in the entire eS that are enrolled in the 
high-school course of study varies from 2 to 5 per cent (Chicago, 2 per 
cent; St. Louis, 23 per cent; New Bedford, 4 per cent; Boston, 5 per 
cent). Hence in school eearcitis enrolling 5,000 pupils and upwards, per 
annum, the high school enrolls 200 or more pupils, as the percentage 
of high-school pupils is usually larger for small cities. The ratio of 
pupils who enter the high school and remain to enter the second year, 
is 57 per cent; to enter the third year, 36 per cent; to enter the senior 
class, 25 per cent. At this ratio there would be about 100 pupils in the 
classentering thehigh school. Thesecould not all recite in one class, and 
would be divided into three, or, perhaps, four divisions. According to 
our principle: “‘ Have as many degrees of advancement in a school as 
there are different classes or divisions for recitations.” We may 
accordingly find our high-school classes ranking as follows: 
I. Senior class ..-...-. 24 members, one division. 
Il. Third-year class....36 members, two divisions, half-year intervals, 
III. Second-year class. ..56 members, two divisions, half-year intervals. 
IV. First-year class. ....90 members, three divisions, quarter to half-year intervals. 
The only ground that can be alleged for desiring to avoid these class 
intervals and reduce all to the standard of the year interval is found in 
the fact that the high-school course usually admits elective courses or 
studies which are not difficult to arrange when the class is so large 
that a full division can be made up on any one of the elective studies 
or courses, but with a small class split up by election of various courses, 
the arrangement becomes impossible without an extremely large 
and expensive corps of teachers. This objection may be met by cur- 
tailing the elective studies and constructing a rational course of study. 
Such an attempt has been made by the committee on course of study
-P-A-G-E-660
        682 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
in our schoots. All pupils are obliged to take Latin during the first 
two years of the high-school course. Election of studies is allowed to 
some extent, but is limited by a rule prescribing the minimum number 
that may form a class in an elective study. 
In this organization of schools, the plan of class intervals of less 
than a year may exist in all the classes except the highest. When the 
number in the high-school course exceeds 500, the senior class will con- 
sist of two or move divisions and should graduate at intervals of half 
ayear. The matter of graduation from the high school is not, however, 
so important. It is easy to bring all the divisions together in the third 
year of the course by adding something to the extremely valuable cul- 
ture studies of that year, so that those who get ready to take the stud- 
ies of the senior class before the close of the year may take up an extra 
amount of work to occupy them until the end of the year. 
For the first two years of the high-school course the class intervals 
should by all means be less than a year if those classes are subdivided 
into two or more divisions. 
The question may arise, how shall we introduce the plan of shorter 
class intervals into the high school. This question would be asked in 
the presence of a system whose course of study has been rigidly 
“nailed to the calendar,” so that each pupil was supposed to complete 
the work of his grade just at the time of the annual examination and at 
no other time, and if he lacked some little time of completing his year’s 
work—say one week or one month—then he should simply be consigned 
to the next class below, and continue a year longer on the work of the 
grade. Attention must be called to the fact that this correspondence 
of the progress of the class in the course of study with the calendar 
indicates violence. Such correspondence is not natural and can not be 
reached or maintained, except by holding back pupils already advanced. 
or by cramming pupils who are not up to the standard. If the natural 
causes are allowed to work, class intervals will appear everywhere, so 
that no two divisions will be at the same degree of advancement in 
their work. What I would laystress on is this: Never try to bring the 
degree of advancement of any two classes or divisions to the same 
exact standard or to standards exactly a year or multiple of years 
apart. Rather encourage the organization of classes at intervals of 
less than a year apart, so that reorganization of classes for economical 
reasons, or for purposes of better classification, may be made at any 
time without inconvenience. This can be done easily when the classes 
are only six or ten weeks apart, but not easily when they are a year 
apart. 
The actual test of advancement of a pupil is maturity or ability to 
go on with the work given him. It is safe to say that even in a country 
school of 60 pupils there are no 2 of exactly the same advancement, 
although it is probable that there are eight years of school work between 
the advancement of the highest and that of the lowest. Now, classifi- 
cation is at all times a merely relative and arbitrary affair. In the
-P-A-G-E-661
CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 633. 
school of 60 the first class in arithmetic may include any number from 
1 to 10, perhaps. Ifit has 10 it is likely that there will be a difference 
in qualifications of from two to three years in actual advancement, and 
the consequence will be that while the lowest will be dragged beyond 
their powers, if they are really compelled to do the work, the most 
advanced will feel no pressure except that of their own caprice. With- 
out looking at their lessons they will easily lead the class. Hence they 
will lose that valuable discipline of the will which comes of a feeling of 
responsibility and the necessity of making persistent and regular 
exertions. 
The ever-repeated experience in such schools is the loss of all hold 
on the pupil’s mental habits by the teacher except what he can get by 
a little individual instruetion. Classification in large schools, though 
still arbitrary, becomes approximately exact. It always happens that 
there is no strongly marked line between the lowest of the class and the 
highest of the class next below. Where there is a year’s interval of school 
work between the classes, it always happens that the interval between 
the highest and lowest in the class is less than the interval between the 
lowest in rank of the upper class and the highest in rank of the lower. 
Bearing in mind this relative nature of classification one can easily see 
the importance of having small intervals between classes. The ques- 
tion of economy here meets the question of classification. The classes 
ought not to be below a certain size; 20 to 30 pupils should be in each 
class; the less the intervals between them the better. In a country 
school of 40 pupils of all grades the size of classes is so seriously limited 
by intervals of advancement that little else than individual instruction 
is the result and the time and energy of the teacher is dissipated. 
In enumerating the causes which tend to render frequent reclassifi- 
cation necessary, I would lay stress upon the following: 
(a) Irregularity of attendance caused by sickness, by necessity of 
working for a living, by change of residence. To show the prevalence 
of this irregularity, I have taken at random the following statistics 
from such sources as are before me:

About two-thirds. of the entire number are in attendance at a given 
time it would seem. Upon return to school, after a period of absence,
-P-A-G-E-662
  634 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
the pupil has the opportunity of falling back into a class one year 
behind or of overtaking the class he left by making extraordinary 
effort. 
(b) Time of commencing school. Nearly one-half of the youngest 
pupils begin their school life in the spring instead of the fall, and con- 
sequently their class interval is three-fourths of a year behind the class 
that entered in the fall before. 
(c) Then there is the difference in temperament and character—the 
slow and the swift, the weak and the strong, the careless and the 
earnest, the mature and the immature, the industrious and the indolent. 
Start all together, and these causes will soon make a great difference. 
It is evident that with small class intervals reassignment of any of 
these pupils who have lost their standing in their classes is an easy 
matter. The system of small class intervals only takes advantage of 
the necessary division into classes, and would not have new divisions 
formed simply for the sake of making short intervals. Pupils that are 
irregular in attendance, or that begin school in the middle of the year, 
or that are immature, have to be dealt with even under the old systems, 
and is it possible to deal with them satisfactorily? They form nearly 
or quite one-third of all the pupils enrolled. 
There is a perpetual diminution of pupils in the higher grades, 
occasioned by final withdrawal from school, and, on the other hand, 
there is a perpetual accession of numbers from below. Not to readjust 
periodically would leave the classes of the high-priced and most expe- 
rienced teachers very small, while the classes of the teachers of least 
experience and smallest salaries would be filled to overflowing, and it 
often happens that pupils are refused for want of room in these grades 
when there is much room in the upper grades. 
Instead of adjusting this at the end of the year, let it be done as 
often as needed by promoting a few of the best pupils in each class to 
the next higher. This will not (a) isolate the poor pupils by them- 
selves, for into eaeh class the best pupils will come from below; (db) 
nor will it fill the upper classes with brilliant, superficial, precocious 
children, for the test of promotion will be maturity—ability to do the 
work of the higher class, and if any other standard is used the evil 
will speedily correct itself, inasmuch as the immature pupils thus pro- 
moted willremain at the bottom of the higher class, and will not get 
promoted again until after they are rejoined by the rest of their class; 
(e) nor will it on an average cause pupils to change teathers any oftener 
than the old system. In fact, unless withdrawal from school in the 
upper grades makes room for the transfer of pupils, they can not be 
transferred from one teacher to another, but the readjustment must be 
effected in part by assigning incompetent pupils to lower classes. The 
actual depletion of upper grades, including the high school, however, 
is sufficient to allow of the “‘sifting-up process” to a sufficient degree to 
make all needed adjustments. If each teacher has two classes, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-663
CLASSIFICATION IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 635 
one-fourth of each class is promoted and joined to the next every ten 
weeks, the average stay of each pupil in her room will be two years; 
if one-third is promoted each time, one year and a half will be the 
average stay under each teacher. The matyrest and ablest pupils will 
stay a less time than the average, while the immature and weak will 
stay for a longer time. The maturest and ablest pupils need less indi- 
vidual help and less psychological study of their idiosyncrasies on the 
part of the teacher. 
Of course it is understood that these promotions are followed by a 
review of studies on the part of all classes into which promotions are 
made. Frequent reviews are essential to thorough work and essential 
to teach pupils how to study. 
Under this system of small class intervals and frequent opportunities 
for promotion, there is not so much high pressure and cramming, nor, 
consequently, so much danger to the health of pupils. If the pupil 
does not get into the high school on this occasion, ten weeks more are 
soon passed, and a review of his studies for that length of time will 
not seem unreasonable. If he is very thorough he will overtake 
many of his former companions who will lose ten weeks for one cause 
or another, in their future course. 
This frequency of examinations for admission to the high school is 
not based on the expectation that every grammar school will graduate 
a class cach quarter, for that would indeed imply too much change of 
teachers; but each grammar school will send one or two classes a 
year and at such times in the year as they are prepared, at one time, 
at the close of the first quarter; and then again perhaps at the close 
of the third quarter, just as it may happen; but there will be enough 
pupils admitted to the high school at the close of each quarter to 
form one or more new divisions. 
Reclassification does not mean a thorough reorganization of classes. 
It may take place on the promotion of one, two, or a dozen pupils from 
one class to the next. The system here recommended is designed pur- 
posely to prevent such complete reorganizations as are necessary when 
a class changes teachers and is divided and united with other classes. 
It substitutes a gradual process for such violent measures. : 
This system has been in practice in St, Louis and Chicago and other 
Western cities, so far as lower grades are concerned, for at least twenty 
years. The effect of the high school examination coming once.a year 
was, however, to prevent the application of the system in the highest 
grades of the district school. The object of the present discussion is 
to bring out the merits of the system as one to be universally applied 
throughout all grades of common schools.

in a study. At all times there are new classes just beginning the 
work of a grade, or year’s work, in some one of our schools. The 
classes are not separated by intervals of one year in their work, but 
by irregular intervals varying from six weeks to twenty. It is con- 
sidered desirable to have these intervals small, so that reclassification 
may be more easily managed. Pupils who fall behind their class for 
ny, reason (such as absence, lack of physical strength or of mental 
ability) may be reclassified with the next lower class without fall- 
ing back a year and thereby becoming discouraged. Pupils who are 
unusually bright or mature may be promoted to the class above, or 
form new classes with the slower pupils of the class above who need 
to review their work. Thus it happens that in a district school there 
is a continued process going on, the elements of which are as follows: 
    ~ (1) Phe older and more advanced pupils are leaving school for business 
or other causes. This depletes the classes of the most skillful and 
best paid teachers who are usually placed in charge of the most 
advanced pupils. Again, there is at all times of the year an influx, 
into the lower grades, of pupils who have just completed their sixth or 
seventh year and are now anxious to begin their school career. Thus 
the pupils in the primary rooms of our schools tend continually to be 
overcrowded. (2) To correct this continued tendency which over- 
crowds the rooms of the least skillful and poorest paid teachers and 
gives small quotas of pupils to the most skillful and best paid teachers, 
from time to time (usually once in ten weeks, but oftener in some 
schools), each class is sifted and its most promising pupils united with 
what remains of the next higher class (i. e., with the not-promising 
portion of it—those who, for absence, or dull intellect, or weak wills, 
fail to keep up with the best). (3) To make room for this transfer, a 
portion of the highest class is sent to the branch high schools. (4) 
The number changed from class to class is usually small. The disturb- 
ance in classes is very slight, compared with the advantages gained 
by the teacher in being relieved of the necessity to drive the laggards 
and drill and cram them to make them keep up with the average of 
the class. The teacher was once obliged to spend most of her time 
upon the dull ones in the useless endeavor to force them to mak- up 
lost time or to equal the strides of the more mature, more regula, or 
more brilliantly gifted pupils, and, of course, these latter pupils lost 
proportionately, and the net result of the process was to overwork the 
incompetent and to hold back the competent ones. The teacher, in the 
vain effort to hold together the extremes of her class, separating more 
widely every day till the end of the year, became cross and petulant, 
and sank continually into the abyss of drill-machine pedagogy. 
Under our present system we can make room, when needed, in the 
lower grades, and fill up the classes of our skillful and high-priced 
teachers.

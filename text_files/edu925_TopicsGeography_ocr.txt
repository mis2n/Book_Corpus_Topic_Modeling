INTRODUCTION. 
Tuese Topics were prepared especially for the use of my 
own schools, and are therefore in every sense the product of 
the school-room. ‘The cordial reception given to them on the 
part of teachers and superintendents now leads to their publi- 
cation. In preparing the Topics for use I aimed : 
first. To increase the value of geographical study, and at 
the same time shorten the time usually spent on the study. 
Second. To show what to teach and what to omit. 
Third. To give a brief outline for the scientific study of any 
continent as based upon structure or slope. Every continent 
should first be studied by this outline and then by the Topics. 
fourth, To present, as the title suggests, the whole subject 
by topics, and to have the topics presented always in the same 
order. 
Fifth. To deal sparingly or not at all in statistics, but rather 
to have all areas taught by comparison. 
Sixth. To make more prominent the natural curiosities and 
wonders, which are always interesting to pupils. 
Seventh, To combine language and geography. For this 
purpose a language course is given for the primary grades, 
which by successive steps is preparatory for the regular work in 
geography. For the higher grades all the subjects suitable for 
language and object lessons are mentioned,

Eighth. To make it as free from errors as possible. It is 
impossible to make any work of this kind absolutely correct, 
for many facts which are true to-day will be untrue to-morrow. 
I have divided the work up into grades to adapt it to our 
course of study; if it does not agree with the course used in 
other places, it is a very easy matter to change the divisions. 
During the preparation I have consulted all the recent 
geographies and encyclopedias, and to all of them I am indebted 
for much valuable information. 
It is earnestly hoped that the Topics may lead both teachers 
and pupils to better results in the important study of Geography.

TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 
GRADE I. 
To the teacher. Wave talks with the children on subjects 
within their comprehension, preparatory to regular work in 
Geography, as form, size, position, etc., of common objects in 
or near the school-house, ‘Train pupils to observe and describe 
the position of objects on the table or in the room, using terms 
tight, left, front, back, front-right-hand corner, back-left-hand 
corner, middle, center. 
_ Draw on the black-board the outline of the school-room, 
requiring the pupils to tell you where to place the representation 
of each object. 
Teach the location and names of the streets near the school. 
Require the pupils to tell through and across what streets 
they pass while coming to school. 
Teach the direction in which the streets extend, that is, 
teach the cardinal and semi-cardinal points of the compass. 
Show pictures, and relate real or imaginary journeys, using 
such words as forests, fields, hills, mountains, valleys, brooks, 
springs, rivers, trees, etc. Be sure that the children understand 
the words used. 
Teach the names of the common fruits and grains, how they 
are planted, how they grow, how they are used or made into 
foods. 
Teach in the same way the different kinds of native trees, 
and for what the wood is used. 
Teach something about the character and uses of the common 
domestic animals.
-P-A-G-E-6
6 TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 
Teach other similar topics. Let your work in this direction| 
be limited only by the intellectual capacity of the children. 
Give incidental lessons at appropriate times, as, about rain 
on rainy days, about clouds on cloudy days, about the sun on 
sunny days, about snow on snowy days, etc. 
Encourage the little ones to bring into the school-room pretty 
leaves, pebbles, etc., and use them, when possible, in oral 
language, drawing, reading, and number lessons. Provide for 
the children’s use a large sand-table upon which to play. Let 
sand and clay modeling form a large part of the busy work for 
the first year. 
GRADE II. 
To the Teacher; 1, Review the work of Grade I. 
2. Show the necessity of a standard of measurement or scale 
as used in map-drawing. 
3- Show the difference between a picture and a map. 
4. Show the picture of a horse, and from it illustrate the fact 
that a picture or a map is sometimes larger and sometimes 
smaller than the object itself. 
5. Have the pupils draw the school-room, school-yard, and 
locality. Scale one inch to the yard. 
6. Teach the children how to tell the direction of one object 
from another in nature, 
7. Teach how to tell the direction of the representations of 
objects in pictures and on maps from one another. Be sure 
that this point is clearly understood. Do not let the children 
think that one object is higher or above another because it is 
north of it. 
8. The Earth. a. Suzface. Show a picture and a map of the 
earth’s surface. Draw from the children the fact that the 
surface is composed of land and water. In this connection be 
sure that the children really understand the character of the

map. The different marks used to represent, the different 
features should be fully explained. Do not let them imagine 
that the different countries are colored in nature as they are on 
the map. 
In teaching the names and definitions of the different bodies 
of water, employ the surroundings of the school-house, and lead 
from them to that which is more distant and unknown. 
Take the class to the open fields by the side of a brook or 
river, where all terms used in geography can be easily taught. 
Draw out from the children, by skillful questioning, definitions 
of all the forms observed. These definitions will always be 
original and frequently very apt. From the words of the 
children, used as a basis, teach the correct definition. Call 
he_ attention of the pupils to the following objects with their

3 TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 
When it is not possible to take a delightful trip with the 
pupils, make a good use of pictures, black-board representations, 
and the sand-table. 
b. Productions. Teach that the land produces plants, 
animals, and minerals; and the water produces fish, salt, 
sponges, coral, etc. 
Here we find the need of a museum in every school. All 
the objects spoken of should be examined by the pupils, when 
possible. Pictures of the objects should also be shown ; pic- 
tures, which show not only the object itself, but the object with 
its surroundings. Do more than exhibit the object or picture ; 
ask questions about it until it is clearly understood. 
c. Motions. Illustrate the daily and annual motions of the 
earth, showing the cause of day and night and the change of 
seasons. 
d. Zones. Show pictures of the different regions of the 
earth’s surface. In this way lead the children to see the differ- 
ent belts or zones of the earth’s surface and how they differ 
from each other. 
9. Read nice descriptions of warm countries, showing the 
peculiar characteristics of the plants, animals, and peoples wha 
live there. 
to. Describe cold countries in the same way. Use these 
descriptions as the basis for language work. - 
11, Have interesting talks upon the common minerals, pro- 
ductions, animals, races, wind, rain, snow, ice, clouds, the 
different employments, the materials used, and where they are 
obtained. . 
12. Let all your conversations on these subjects lead the 
children to a clear conception of the size, diversity, and beauty 
of this earth, and to the wisdom of its Creator. 
13. All work done in this grade should be done as language 
work, remembering that these topics are not given as so many
-P-A-G-E-9
“TorPIcs IN GEOGRAPHY. 9 
facts to be scientifically taught, but are given rather as pleasant 
and interesting subjects for conversation. 
GRADE III. 
The Elementary Geography is usually placed in the hands 
of the pupils at the commencement of this grade. When this 
is done, it should be used only as a reading-book, never as a 
text-book to be studied. All the teaching should be done by 
the teacher, using largely home-made maps and _ pictures, 
gathered from all sources. Remember that a child’s like or 
dislike of a very. interesting study depends mainly upon a 
teacher’s success in language and object lessons. A skillful 
teacher will awaken in every child a love of nature, a desire to 
travel and to read books of travel. Read to them such books 
as Miss Andrews’ “Seven Little Sisters” and “Each and 
All” 
I. Read the suggestions to Grade II., and enlarge on the 
topics given there. 
II. Crry.— Draw a map indicating the position of the princi- 
pal streets, canals, public buildings and parks. Show the 
position of the city in the township, and the course of any 
tiver. In language lessons teach: 1. Divisions into wards. 
2. Occupations. 3. Railroads. 4. Government. 5. Water- 
works, 6. Fire department. 7. Public schools. 8. History. 
III. County. — 1. Name and boundary. 
2, Names of cities and towns in it, 
3. Location of home city. 
4. Location of county seat. Why so called? 
5. Names of rivers in the county. Are they navigable? Do 
they furnish water-power? What is manufactured ? 
6. Have the pupils write letters, describing the county and 
city.
-P-A-G-E-10
10 TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY, 
IV. Tae Eartu.— 1. Review previous topics. 
2, Teach meaning of sphere and hemisphere. 
3- Show that the earth could be divided into land and water 
hemispheres, 
4. Show northern and southern hemispheres, and that there 
is more land in the northern. 
5. Show eastern and western hemispheres. Why called the 
Old and New World? 
6. Continents. Name the six. Compare them in reference 
to size, position, shape, outline. 
N.B. During the teaching of these topics you should have 
before your class a globe and a map of the world, that the 
picture of the continents and their position in reference to each 
other may be so often seen as to make a lasting impression on 
the memory. Prepare interesting lessons to be given at this 
point. Talk with the.pupils about the different races, nations, 
animals, and productions, and point out the location of countries 
where each may be found. Lead the pupils to notice that 
animals live on the tandin the water, in cold countries, in 
warm countries, on mowfitains, in deserts, etc. Study the ani- 
mals with a view of determining vinci adapts the 
animals to their own surroundings. hen this is done, the 
children will quickly associate the animal with the place and 
the place with the animal. The characteristics and peculiari- 
ties of plants should be studied in the same way; also the 
manners and customs of the people of the world.

Mississippi river is the largest river in North America. It flows 
into the Gulf of Mexico. 
VI.— EasTeRN HemisPHERE, OR OLD Wor.p. 
1, Contains Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and many islands.

3- Seas, Gulfs, Bays: Mediterranean, Arabian, Bengal, 
Guinea. 
4. Rivers: Danube, Nile, Congo, Yang-tse-Kiang. 
5. Mountains: Alps, Himalaya, Atlas. 
6. Language Lessons. Prepare many sentences like the fol- 
lowing: The largest continent is Asia, but Europe and North ~ 
America have the most important countries. There are five 
oceans, The Pacific is the largest, but the Atlantic is the most 
important. Have talks with the children about the different 
articles found for sale in the stores, where they are obtained, 
how they are brought here, what people produce them. In 
this way you can travel over the whole world during every 
lesson. 
CONTINENT IN RELIEF. 
The children are supposed to have had much practice in 
moulding the different forms in sand and clay. Sand model- 
ing should now receive more attention and for a different 
reason. It is not expected that the teacher will make this 
subject as prominent in Grade III as in Grade V; but in all 
grades much should be done. 
By, sand modeling the clearest conception of slope or struc- 
ture can be obtained.
-P-A-G-E-12
12 TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY, 
1. Upon the general direction of the primary and secondary 
highlands depends the amount of rainfall of any section. 
The highest mountain ranges act as rain condensers; the 
lowest mountains or highlands serve as water partings, turn- 
ing. the waters of the continents into certain directions. Any 
change in either of these highlands would in many cases turn 
deserts into fertile fields and fertile fields into deserts. 
2, The position of the plateaus, because it determines the 
rainfall and gives direction to the rivers, regulates the soil. 
The water disintegrates the rocks of the mountains, and con- 
stantly grinds the pebbles finer and sweeps all before it into 
the valleys, depositing it along its course according to its 
weight, the coarser material first, the finest and richest last. 
3. The position and elevation of the plateaus and moun- 
tains also modify temperature. A good illustration of this 
can be seen in Mexico, where is found continual heat, per- 
petual springtime, and everlasting snow. 
4. Upon the soil and climate must necessarily depend 
vegetation. . 
5+ Upon vegetation animal life depends. 
6. Upon production also depends commercial intercourse 
and the occupation of man. 
A complete treatise on this subject can be found in Alex. 
E. Frye’s “ Child and Nature.” 
Before commencing the study of any continent by the 
Topics, a relief map should be studied with a view to deter- 
mine the immediate relations existing between the various 
parts of the subject. 
After each continent has been studied in relief, then review 
it according to the Topics; but the greater part of the mat- 
ter given in the Topics can be brought out during the first 
study.

to persuade the people of Iceland to come there to live and 
in order to do so called it a beautiful and green land. It is 
really colder than Iceland.

Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, Mexico, Quebec, Montreal. 
11. History. About the year 1000, America was discovered 
by some people from Iceland. They soon left the country 
and nothing was gained by their discovery. In 1492 Colum- 
bus discovered some of the islands of the West Indies and a 
few years later he discovered the coast of South America, 
while John and Sebastian Cabot discovered the main-land of 
North America. 
1z. Language Lessons. Use topics 8, 9, and 11 for this 
purpose. Notice the great cold of the northern part and how 
hard it is for the inhabitants to gain a livelihood. Contrast 
their condition with that of the inhabitants of the West Indies. 
Compare the inhabitants of the different countries of North 
America in respect to their appearance, dress, houses, etc.

Spaniards at St. Augustine in 1565. No English settle: 
was successful till Jamestown was settled in 1607. New” 
was next settled by the Dutch in 1614 and Massachuset' 
the Puritans in 1620. Before long thirteen colonies .. 0 
settled. These were subject to England till they declared 
their independence July 4, 1776, and won it by the Revolu- 
tion. Since that time our government has been prosperous. 
13. Language lessons. For reproduction read interesting 
stories about the trials of the early settlers and their manner 
of life. You know not how much a child’s mind ‘can retain, 
nor what a desire for historical information may be awakened,

are 40 senators and 240 representatives. Together they are 
called the Legislature. Every year also the people elect a 
Governor and a Council of eight men, a Lieutenant-Governor, 
Secretary, Treasurer, Auditor and Attorney-General. These 
men execute the law. There are also judges, who are to 
preside over the courts, and to pronounce sentence upon 
any one who is convicted of breaking the law. These men 
are appointed by the Governor and Council.

of Japan consists of four large islands and 3850 small ones. 
Ceylon and Formosa are also important islands. 
g. Peninsulas. Kamchatka, Corea, Malay, Hindoostan, 
Arabian. . 
4. Surface. In the center is an immense plateau, consisting ~ 
of lofty mountains, vast deserts, and plains. 
a, Mountain Ranges. Himalaya, “abode of snow,” loftiest 
mountain-range in the world ; Altai, “golden mountain.” 
b. Peaks. Everest is the highest, or next to the highest peak 
in the world, more than five miles high. Many other peaks in 
the Himalaya range are nearly as high. How does this range 
compare with the Rocky of America? 
c. Plains. There are many deserts in the western and cen- 
tral parts of Asia. 
5. Lakes, The lakes are few, small and unimportant. 
6. Rivers. Lena, Hoang Ho or Yellow, Yang-tse-Kiang, 
Ganges, Obe, Yenisei, Indus and Euphrates. 
7. Soil. India and China have a fertile soil. The rest of 
Asia contains very little good soil except in the river valleys. 
8, Climate. There is every variety of climate. In some 
places in northern Siberia the ground is always frozen, while 
Mecca is called the hottest place on earth.

9. Productions. a. Agricultural. ‘In the frozen regions of 
Siberia only moss can grow; in the southern parts of Asia 
forests of valuable woods, plants of cinnamon and camphor, 
plamations of tea and coffee. Very little tea is produced out- 
_ pide of Asia. In Persia are large fields of roses, from which is 
’ made the celebrated “attar of roses.” 
b. Mineral, Here are found diamonds, rubies, sapphires, 
gold, silver, copper, iron, etc. 
c. Manufactured. From Persia we get the finest shawls and 
carpets ; from China and Japan silks, laces, satins, linens, car- 
vings of wood, ivory and stone. Calico was first made in 
Calicut, India, from which it derived its name. 
10. Races. Here are found the Caucasian, Mongolian and 
Malay races. Explain the differences clearly to the children. 
tr. Animals. Asia is the originial home of our most common 
domestic animals and fowls. Here also we find the rhinoceros, 
elephant, tiger, camel, yak, leopard, buffalo, monkey, ostrich, 
peacock, bird of Paradise, cobra-di-capello. 
12. Cities. There are many large cities in Asia. They 
have usually narrow, crooked and dirty streets, while the stench 
is often sickening. They are usually enclosed with high walls. 
There are at least thirty cities in Asia where the population is 
over 100,000, How do they compare with home city? The 
most important ones are: Tokio, the capital of Japan, Pekin, 
the capital of China, Canton, the commercial city of China, 
where the streets are too narrow for carriages, Calcutta, Bom- 
bay, Shanghai.

3000 miles long and 1000 miles wide. How does it compare 
in size with the United States? 
5. Lakes. The largest are: Tchad, Albert, Nyassa, Victoria. 
Victoria is larger than Superior ; and therefore it is the largest 
body of fresh water in the world. 
6. Rivers. Nile, Congo, and Niger are the largest rivers. 
The Nile is noted for its annual overflow and lack of tributaries
-P-A-G-E-40
42 TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 
7. Climate. It is hot and dry in the north and south ; ho 
and moist in the central part. Because of its situation in the 
Torrid Zone and because of the number of its deserts the heat 
is at times unbearable. In the desert of Sahara the temperature 
sometimes rises to 150 degrees in the daytime and falls below 
freezing at night. There are two seasons. 
8. Productions. The most important are gold, ivory, dia- 
monds, ostrich feathers, dates, gum-arabic. 
9. Animals. Africa is noted for the number and variety 
of its wild animals. The most important are: giraffe, hippo- 
potamus, zebra, gorilla, elephant, rhinoceros, lion, crocodile, 
ostrich. 
10. Nations, Egypt is the most important one. It is one 
of the oldest nations in the world. Where is the Suez 
Canal? Why is it important? 
11. Cities. The most important cities are: Cairo, one of 
the oldest in the world, Alexandria, the chief seaport, and 
Cape Town. 
12. Language and Object Lessons. Continue the compar- 
sons of one continent with another in regard to all topics. 
Have the children take imaginary journeys from home city 
to the different parts of Africa. For language lessons the 
following: The Nile, the Sahara, the animals, the inhabitants, 
ivory, etc.

1. Position. It includes most of the islands of the Pacific. 
The largest is Australia, which is called a continent, being 
nearly as large as the United States, and belongs to Great 
Britain. . 
2. Divisions. Oceania is usually divided into three groups, 
a. Malaysia. This group is inhabited by the Malays, and 
includes the islands of Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Phillipine,
-P-A-G-E-41

b. Australasia. c. Polynesia. This means many islands, and 
includes the rest of Oceania. 
3. Productions. These are gold, wool, coffee, spices, date, 
cocoanut, camphor. 
4. Animals. In Malaysia are found the same animals as 
in Asia; in Australia are found the kangaroo, wombat, lyre- 
bird. The birds and butterflies are the most beautiful in the 
world. Some of the butterflies measure more than twelve 
inches across the wings. 
5. Cities, The largest is Melbourne. Sydney is second. 
6. Language and Object Lessons, Continue comparisons 
and journeys as usual. Describe Australia, called “The 
Land of Inverted Orders.” “We find here the most beautiful 
birds but they do not sing; birds without feathers, an animal 
with the bill of a duck and the body of an otter; flowers of 
exquisite colors, but with no fragrance, while the leaves of 
many trees are very fragrant; pears with the stem on the 
large end ; cherries with the stone on the outside; trees that 
shed their bark instead of their leaves, and whose leaves give 
no shade; bees that do not sting; black swans and white 
eagles.” Describe “The Valley of Death” in Java, the ani- 
mals, the inhabitants. 
CoMPLETE GEOGRAPHY. 
At this stage the so-called Complete Geography is: intro- 
duced. Before it is used I would call the attention of all 
teachers in the higher grades to the following : 
1. See that the pupils have a clear understanding of the 
things taught as well as the words. Do not imagine that 
object lessons should be confined to the lower classes. Pro- 
ductions, pictures of animals, peoples, and characteristic 
scenes should be shown to all the classes. 
2. Care should be taken that all places and objects men-
-P-A-G-E-42
44. TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 
tioned should be accurately located. The rivers, mountain 
and boundaries should be carefully traced throughout thei 
entire length upon the map. 
3. The children receive erroneous ideas in regard to th 
relative sizes of the countries, because the countries are draw 
by different scales. Correct these errors by constant refe 
ence to one map where one uniform scale is used. 
4. Do not allow the pupils to learn one fact afte 
without understanding the relations of these facts. 
5. If a pupil makes a wrong statement, do not simply co: 
rect him, but, when possible by skillful questioning, lead hi 
to see and correct his own error. 
6. Pupils should be encouraged to read books of traved 
relating to the continents studied. They should be ques- 
tioned on what they read, and so taught to read more care. 
fully. 
7. Encourage the pupils to cut from papers any ite: 
general or useful information, also to bring pictures tha’ 
upon the work in hand. 
8. During the study the attention of the pupils shou 
directed toward the following subjects : 
1. Commerce, —the history and growth 
important commercial countries, the advantage 
that make them important, how commerce is 
the different countries, the important caravan 
routes, water routes, the leading articles of cx 
what country exported, to what country impor 
large cities of all the countries, but particularh 
States, and study them as indicated above. 
2. Winds. What they are, how caused; 
winds of the different countries, what they c: 
help commerce, how hinder it; the prevailin
-P-A-G-E-43
    TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 45 
hurricanes, whirlwinds, simooms, monsoons, why some winds 
are hot, some cold, some moist, some dry, land and sea 
breezes, zone of calms. 
3. Climate. This embraces a study of latitude, elevation, 
trend of mountain-ranges, directions of the winds, the - 
amount of rainfall, nearness to the sea, and nature of the soil. 
4. Moisture. Fogs, clouds, rain, snow, hail, frost, avalan- 
ches, glaciers, icebergs; their cause, the location of regions 
that are rainless, that have periodical rains, the effect of 
moisture on soil, on climate. 
5. Ocean. Its waves, tides, currents; their cause and 
value. 
6. In the same way study the causes and uses of moun- 
tains, hills, valleys, plains, volcanoes, geysers, and hot 
springs. 
7. Plants. These should be studied with a view to deter- 
mine the laws that govern their distribution, confining some 
to narrow limits, extending others over the whole world. 
8. Animals, These are also by nature limited to certain 
sections of the globe. Group the animals and plants into 
great natural regions, then study their habits and uses. 
GRADE V. 
To the Teacher; In studying the first part of the Geogra- 
phy, see to it that the definitions are not empty words to be 
forgotten in less time than it takes to learn them. On the 
other hand, when the pupils can associate the definition with 
the thing defined they should firmly fix the definitions in the 
memory. . 
Do not compel the child to learn about the motions of the 
earth until they have been carefully taught and illustrated. For 
this purpose use a lamp and a globe. In this way you can 
easily teach the meaning of the terms: day, night, noon,
-P-A-G-E-44
46 TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 
midnight, sunrise, sunset, and twilight. In the same way 
moving the globe around the lamp, the change of seasons c 
be shown. Also illustrate how the change of seasons, zonel 
and the difference in the length of the days and nights 
depend upon the inclination of the earth’s axis. 
Before the pupils study about circles and latitude and lo: 
gitude, show the need of such lines. A knitting needle an 
a ball will be all that is required. 
1. Show the difficulty in locating places upon this ball. 
2. Call attention to the two poles, the only fixed places o: 
the ball. 
3- Let them see that to help us measure the distance fron 
the poles, we could draw a line around the ball, equa” 
tant from the poles. We should call this an equator o 
divider. 
4. The children should see that to enable us to tell more 
accurately the distance of any spot from our equator, we 
need other lines parallel to the equator. Draw them anc 
call them parallels. 
5. Lead the children now to see that we can give the dis 
tance of any spot from the equator, but not its position eas 
or west. We must, therefore, have some fixed line fron 
which to reckon distance east and west. Tell them that the 
English choose a line passing through a great observatory ai 
Greenwich; the French choose one passing through Paris 
and we choose one passing through our capitol at Wash 
ington. The one most commonly used is the one 
wich. This line running from pole to pole is called i 
the line of mid-day, because all the places on this 
mid-day at the same time. 
6. Next show the need of other meridian lines to aid it 
locating places. 
7. Explain to the children that the Romans supposed th
-P-A-G-E-45
TOPICS IN CEOGRAPHY. 47 
earth to be flat and longer from east to west than from north 
to south and hence called that measurement long-itude. The 
other measurement was therefore the breadth and called lat- 
itude. . 
8. Show that every circle is divided into 360°. The num- 
ber 360 was chosen because it has so many exact divisors. 
g. Let the children discover that latitude, being only dis- 
tance from the equator to the pole, can only be counted bya 
quarter-circle or 90° and that longitude can be counted by a 
half-circle or 180°. 
10, Before leaving the subject give the pupils a great deal 
of practice in finding places by giving to them the latitude 
and longitude,

in the Old World nearly all the land is crowded together 
north of the equator and extends from northeast to south- 
west. 
Have them compare the slope and trend of the mountain 
systems, and from this comparison develop the facts concern- 
ing climate, soil, productions, etc. 
Have them study the forms of the continents until a correct 
picture is formed in their memory. 
Let them arrange the grand divisions in pairs, and point. 
out in which pair they look most alike, in which least 
alike. Let them also learn which is largest, which is small- 
est, and how they compare with one another in size. Let 
them learn the direction of the grand divisions one from 
another; how they are connected or how separated. 
This work should be indefinitely extended as it is the most 
practical work in geography. So many of otr pupils remain 
in school but a few years that it is more important for them 
to have a correct knowledge of the continents as a whole, 
around which to gather items of information that they may 
meet in after life, than to memorize a large number of discon- 
nected facts that in all probability will be of little or no value 
to them.

Central Plain, the Western Highlands. 
a, Mountain Ranges. In the eastern part is the Appaia- 
chian system, comprising many ranges, the most important of 
which are Alleghany, Blue, Cumberland. From 200 to 700 
miles from the Pacific are the Rocky Mountains, south of 
Colorado called Sierra Madre. West of the Rocky Moun. 
tains are the Cascade, Sierra Nevada, and Coast. 
b. Zeaks. The most important are: St. Elias, Cascade |

Range, 16,000 feet, highest in Rocky; Mitchell, Appalachian, 
6,700 feet, highest east of the Mississippi; Popocatepetl, 
Hooker, Fairweather, Hecla, Cook and Crillon. 
5. Lakes. North America is noted for its great lakes, 
which contain nearly three-fourths of all the fresh water on 
the globe. A straight line from the mouth of the Mackenzie 
river to the Chesapeake bay would pass through nearly every 
large lake in North America. The great lakes in Canada are 
noted for their transparency; those of the eastern part of the 
United States for their commercial facilities; those in the 
western part for their saltness. Lake Superior is the largest ° 
ornext to the largest body of fresh water on theglobe. Great 
Salt Lake is one of the largest salt lakes on the globe. The 
largest lakes are: Superior, Huron, Michigan, Erie, Ontario, 
Winnipeg, Athabasca, Great Bear, Great Slave, Great Salt, 
Nicaragua. 
6. Rivers. There are four great drainage slopes: The 
Arctic, the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf. The Mississippi 
river basin is next to the largest river basin in the world. 
What is a river basin? The Mississippi and Missouri form 
the longest river in the world. The Yukon, first in volume 
of water in North America, is remarkable for its rapids and 
islands. In some places it is five miles wide. The Colum- 
bia and Colorado flow in some places through deep cafions. 
What is a cafion? Locate and tell to which river system 
they belong: Mackenzie, Yukon, Nelson, St. Lawrence, Hud- 
son, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Arkansas, Rio Grande, Col- 
orado, Columbia. 
yz. Soil. Except in the far north and the Great Western 
Highland, the soil is very fertile. 
8. Climate. The northern part is very cold; the central 
part has a variable climate, usually having hot summers and 
cold winters; the southern portion has a tropical climate.

What effects have the ocean currents upon the climate o 
Labrador and the North Pacific coast? 
9. Productions. a. Agricudtural. These are wheat, corn 
rye, oats, barley, rice, cotton, tobacco, sugar-cane and th 
different fruits of the Temperate and Torrid Zones. 
Maize, potatoes and tobacco were made known ta 
world by the discovery of America. 
b. Mineral. Minerals of nearly every kind are found in| 
abundance. The principal ones are gold, silver, iron, coal 
lead, zinc, copper, petroleum, marble, etc. 
c. Manufactured, These are of many varieties. The 
United States takes the lead of all states in North America 
in manufacturing. In what part of North America are the 
different productions found ? 
1o. Natural Advantages. Excellent soil, good climate and 
facilities for markets are America’s advantages for agriculture, 
Its numerous bays, length of sea coast (more than any other 
country), navigable rivers and lakes afford commercial advan. 
tages not excelled by any other continent. 
Abundance of minerals and raw products, good shipping 
and water-power are the advantages for manufactures. 
ir. Animals, Nearly all the domestic animals were brought 
here by the European settlers. Among the native animals 
are the musk-ox, white bear, silver fox, whale, seal, and wal- 
tus of the polar regions. Bear, wolf, panther, bison and deer 
are found in the temperate parts. Monkeys, alligators, poi- 
sonous serpents, and birds of beautiful plumage in the tropical 
parts, Cod, herring, salmon, and shad are abundant in all 
waters. Turkeys were found here when America was dis- 
covered and two of them taken to Europe by the discoverers 
as Curiosities. .

descendants of Europeans. The Indians who occupied this 
country when discovered are rapidly decreasing. Most of 
them live in Mexico and Central America. 
The Negroes are descendants of slaves brought here from 
Africa. The northern part is inhabited by Esquimaux of the 
Turanic race. There are also many thousands of emigrants 
from all the different parts of Europe and Asia. 
b. Occupation. More than one-half of the people are en- 
gaged in agriculture. Commerce, manufacturing, and mining 
are also carried on. 
14. Cities. Locate: New York, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, - 
Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, Montreal, Mexico, Havana, 
New Orleans. 
15. History. Iceland was discovered in the gth century 
and settled by Irish and Norwegian colonies. Some people 
from Iceland sailed along the coast of North America as early 
as 1000, but the real discovery of America dates from 1492, 
when Columbus discovered the West Indies. A few years 
later the Cabots explored the coast as far as Florida, The 
French took possession of Canada and made settlements there. 
French Jesuits explored the Mississippi Valley. English 
settled the Atlantic coast commencing at Jamestown. The 
Spaniards made their settlements all around the Gulf of 
Mexico and on the Pacific coast. 
16. Language and Object Lessons. Continue descriptions 
ot journeys and pictures. The different animals and birds 
should be described in coject lessons; also glaciers, geysers, 
volcanoes, and the regions around the north pole. For 
language work assign different topics to different pupils: 
Surface, — including mountains, lakes and rivers; climate, — 
where cold, hot, dry, temperate, moist; people, — different 
races, their dress, language and mode of living; products, — 
different trees, plants, animals, and minerals of the different 
zones, etc.

Potomac river is navigable for 110 miles; the Missouri for 
2600 miles. All the other rivers mentioned are navigable for 
distances varying between these limits. Of what advantage 
to the United States are its numerous navigable rivers ? 
7. Soil. See Section 4, c. and d. 
8. Climate. It is greatly varied. In the north, the cold in 
winter is extreme, lasting five months. The coldest place is 
said to be in the northern part of Dakota, The climate of 
the southern part is unhealthy in the summer. It is much 
warmer on the Pacific than the Atlantic coast. The Pacific 
coast of Alaska has a warmer climate than the coast of
-P-A-G-E-54
56 TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 
Maine. This warmer climate on the Pacific is caused by t 
warm ocean current which bathes the coast. Generally t 
climate of the United States is as healthy as that of any oth: 
part of the world. 
9. Productions, a. Agricultural, These are hay, corn, ry 
and oats for the north-eastern part; wheat, oats, corn an 
potatoes for the Central States; cotton, corn, rice, sug 
tobacco, hemp, oranges and lemons for the Southern States 
wheat, fruit and cattle for the Western States. 
b. Mineral. Gold and silver are found in nearly all th 
western states and territories. Iron is very common; coal i 
found in greater quantities than in any other country. Th 
other minerals are lead, copper, petroleum, quicksilver, etc. 
ce. Manufactured. New York ranks first and Pennsylvani: 
second as manufacturing states. The leading articles o 
manufacture are cotton and woolen goods, boots and shoes, 
agricultural implements and liquors. 
to. Commerce. The value of our commerce is, next to 
Great Britain, the most extensive in the world. There are 
ninety-three seaports in the United States, Tk 
portant are: New York, Boston, New Orleans, Sar 
Philadelphia, Baltimore. Locate these places anu uame tne 
exports from each. The exports of the United State: 
chiefly food stuffs, cotton and petroleum to Europe. 
imports from Europe are sugar and dress goods ; from Soutn 
America toffee and hides; from Asia tea, silks and rice. A 
large amount of domestic commerce is carried on by means 
of our numerous lakes, rivers, canals and railroads.

d. Language, English is the prevailing language, bat in 
different parts the German, French, and Spanish languages 
are used, 
e. Government. It is a Republic of forty-four states, six 
- ‘territories, and one district. Each state is independent in, 
e 
' the United States. The Constitution is the highest law in its local affairs and its government is patterned after that of 
the land. It divides the government into three departments : 
Legislative, Executive and Judicial. The people of the dif- 
ferent states elect men to make their laws. These men meet 
in Washington in two rooms at the capitol. Those in one 
room are called Representatives ; those in the other Senators; 
together they are called Congress. This is the Legislative 
Department. 
The states also elect a man who is to see that the laws are 
- obeyed. Heis called the president, and is elected for four 
: years. He is at the head of the Executive Department. 
There are also judges who explain the law. They form 
' the Judicial Department. 
£. Education. Education is encouraged in all the States ; 
In some it is made compulsory. 
g. Religion. There is no established church as in some 
countries, but every one has a right to his own religious 
| belief.

was explored, and various attempts were made at settlemen 
but none were successful until Jamestown, Va., was settled 
1607 by the English; New York by the Dutch in 1614, a 
Massachusetts by the Puritans in 1620. Soon thirteen stat 
were settled. These were as follows: New Hampshir 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, N 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Viry 
Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. After : 
war known as the Revolution, these states won thuu supe 
‘dence from England. Since then the United States ha 
grown in number, wealth and power.

VI.— Daniso AMERICA. 
1. Position. It is in the north-eastern part of | 
America and is composed of two islands, Greenland ana ice 
land, belonging to Denmark.

a. Volcanoes. There are 30 volcanoes in Iceland. Hecla 
» and Skaptar are the most noted. 
b. Watural Curiosities, Within a circuit of two miles 
there are more than roo hot springs and geysers. The 
Great Geyser is the most noted one. Nowhere in the world 
is the Aurora Borealis seen in such splendor as here. 
1 4. Soil. The soil is barren because of the cold. 
\ 5. Climate. The climate of Greenland is severe. Snow 
falls during every month in the year; yet there are proofs that 
the climate was once tropical. Here, during the winter, the 
people do not see the sun for several months, and in the sum- 
mer the sun never sets. The climate of Iceland is so much 
warmer than that of Greenland that the people can keep 
ponies, cattle and sheep. 
6. Productions. Mosses and lichens grow in the north 
. and furnish food for the reindeer, musk-ox and bear. In the 
south of Greenland the pine and birch grow to be five feet 
high. There is but little timber in Iceland, so the people 
depend upon the @riftwood. Oats and garden vegetables 
grow in Iceland. 
7. Animals. The wild animals are the white bear, whale, 
walrus, reindeer and fox. Sea-fowls and fish are abundant. 
8. Inhabitants. The people of Iceland are of Scandina- 
vian descent and are famous for their hospitality and learn- 
ing. The people of Greenland are mainly Esquimaux. They 
are short in stature, live on seal-blubber, and in winter live 
' in houses of snow. 
9. Cities. Reikjavik, signifies “steam-town,” so called 
from the geysers near it. It is the capital of Iceland. Uper- 
navik is the most northern town in the world, situated on the 
north-western coast of Greenland. 
1o. History. Iceland was discovered about 960 by a 
Norwegian pirate. The Icelanders were hardy and brave

Ranges there are no very important ones. 
b. Peaks. Brown, Hooker, Murchison, Lyell. 
c. Natural Curiosities. Al the scenery is romantic and 
picturesque. All the rivers abound in beautiful falls, the 
most noted are those of Montmorenci. It is now claimed 
that the most wonderful cataract in the world has just been 
discovered in the interior of Labrador. The falls are on the 
Grand River and are estimated to be at least 2000 feet in 
height. 
4. Lakes. The lakes of Canada are very numerous. The 
same lake is sometimes the source of different rivers, so that 
it is possible to pass from one river system to another by 
water, as from the Hudson bay into the Great Lakes. The 
lakes are noted for their transparency. In Great Bear Lake 
an object can be seen to the depth of go feet. The following 
lakes are important: Winnipeg, Great Bear, Great Slave, 
Athabasca. 
5. Rivers. There are many rivers here, navigable in. the 
summer, but frozen over in the winter. During this season 
iceboats are used. The important rivers are: St. Lawrence, 
Mackenzie, Athabasca, Peace, Nelson, Saskatchewan. 
6. Soil. The northern part is unproductive, but the 
southern part is similar to the northern part of the United 
States. Large parts of Quebec, Labrador, and Newfoundland 
are almost barren. 
7. Climate. The climate is much like that of Danish 
America; noted for its severity. The summers are short 
and hot. The western part is much warmer than the east- 
ern. 
8. Productions. a. Agricultural. Fruits and nuts of the

temperate climate are found. Corn will not ripen except in 
the southern part. Manitoba is noted for its wheat. Hay is 
a leading product. 
b. Mineral. Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Ontario 
are rich in minerals, as iron, lead, tin, copper, and coal. 
Here is also quarried the stone from which grindstones are 
made. 
c. Manufactured. Nearly all the manufactured goods are 
imported from Europe or the United States. 
9. Improvements. Suspension Bridge is one of the noted 
bridges in the world. The Welland canal permits boats to 
pass around the Niagara Falls. 
io. Animais. The wild animals comprise the bison, bear, 
moose, wolf, beaver, otter, ermine, mink and marten. Most 
of these are hunted for their skins, so that furs form an im- 
portant product. Fish are abundant in all the waters. 
11. Inhabitants. a. Race. The people are mainly of Eng- 
lish descent. Those of the south eastern provinces are 
descended from the early French settlers. Many of the in- 
habitants of the territories are Indians and half-breeds. 
b. Occupation. Agriculture, hunting, fishing and lumber- 
ing are the chief occupations. 
12. Government. The government is in many respects 
similar to that of the United States. The chief executive is 
called Governor-General, and is appointed by the Crown of 
England. Though belonging to England, Canada enjoys 
Home Rule. 
13. Cities. Ottawa, Ontario, is the capital of the Domin- 
ion of Canada, and contains magnificent public buildings, 
Montreal is the largest city in.Canada. It is built upon an 
island in the St. Lawrence river. It contains the cat’ —

a beautiful situation. It is the largest lake-port in Canada. 
Quebec, the capital of Quebec, has a picturesque situation on 
the St. Lawrence, and is called the Gibraltar of America 
because of its strong fortresses. Halifax, the capital of Nova 
Scotia, is situated on one of the finest harbors in the world. 
St. John is the chief city of New Brunswick. St. Johns, the 
capital of Newfoundland, and the most easterly city in North 
America south of Greenland, is an important fishing station. 
Frederickton is the capital of New Brunswick. Charlotte- 
town is the capital of Prince Edward Island. Hamilton, on 
Lake Ontario is an important lake-port. London is an agri- 
cultural region, and is much visited by invalids on account of 
its white sulphur springs. Winnipeg is the capital of Mani- 
toba, and is called the “ Gate of the N. orth-west.” Victoria is 
the capital and chief seaport of British Columbia. Vancou- 
ver is the western terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. 
14. Language Lessons. Fascinating stories should be read 
to the pupils for reproduction about the life in the polar 
regions. Read about the animals, the glaciers, the icebergs, 
the attempts to find the north pole, running the rapids of the 
St. Lawrence. Have the pupils gather pictures and news- 
paper clippings about the polar regions, which should be duly 
mounted and preserved. Read about the capture of Quebec 
during the French and Indian War. 
VIII. — Mexico. 
1. Position. It is south of the United States. 
2. Extent. It is about one-fourth the size of the United 
States. 
3. Coast. The Gulf coast contains few harbors, and these 
are obstructed by sandbars. Violent tempests render both 
coasts unsafe for several months every year.

4. Surface. It is a high plateau and table-land, crossed 
by several ranges of snow-capped mountains. The eastern 
coast is low. 
a. Mountain Ranges. Several ranges cross Mexico, but 
the chief range is the Sierra Madre, “ Mother Range.” The 
mountains around the City of Mexico are called Cordilleras. 
b. Peaks, There are many volcanoes and some are of great 
height. Popocatepetl, “the hill that smokes,” is next to the 
highest mountain in North America. Iztaccihuatl, ‘‘ the white 
lady,” resembles a woman with a white cloth spread over 
her, and the Mexicans have a superstition that she is the wife 
of Montezuma, the sovereign of Mexico at the time of its con- 
quest by Cortez. Locate also Orizaba. 
c. WMatural Curiosities. Mexico is covered with relics of a 
former great nation. ‘There are many ruins and pyramids. 
All the scenery is grand. Near the City of Mexico is the 
echoing cave, where a man’s voice echoes and re-echoes 
almost like thunder. . 
_ 5. Lakes. The lakes are numerous but small. ‘Tezcoco 
is one of the largest, and contains the islands on which the 
old city of Mexico was built. Here were the celebrated 
floating gardens formed by covering rafts with a layer of rich 
earth and allowing them to float from place to place.
-P-A-G-E-63
  TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 65 
6. Rivers. The rivers are short and not navigable beyond 
the tide-water line. Rio Grande, Santiago and Balsas are 
the largest. 
7. Soil. .The low plains are fertile and covered with a 
luxuriant vegetation. Most of the central table-land is dry 
and barren. 
8. Climate. The climate is hot and unhealthy along the 
coast, but mild and healthful in the interior. In going from 
Vera Cruz to the City of Mexico, only a few hours’ ride, you 
will pass through every degree of climate and find the pro- 
ductions peculiar to every zone. There are two seasons, the 
rainy and the dry. The rainy season lasts four months, com- 
mencing at the end of May. ‘The rain falls usually in the 
afternoon, and oftentimes without any warning. 
9. Productions, a. Agricultural, .Mexico, owing to the 
different elevations, has every variety of climate and produc- 
tions. Here we find the tropical fruits, as yams, oranges, 
melons, bananas, figs, etc. Here is the maguey, a plant 
which yields an abundance of juice, which is made into a 
kind of fermented drink, called pulque. The latter is dis- 
tilled into intoxicating liquor, which is a favorite drink among 
the people. One plant produces a hundred bottles of pulque. 
From the root of the same plant is made sugar, and from the 
fibers, hemp, ‘There are here also about forty species of cacti, 
on which a little red insect feeds. The dried bodies of these 
insects furnish the cochineal of commerce, from which a 
beautiful red dye is made. The cacao tree produces a bean 
from which cocoa and chocolate. are prepared. Vanilla is 
the seed or bean of a climbing plant, and is valuable for the 
flavoring extract made from it. The forests yield many valu- 
able woods, as mahogany, Brazil-wood, ebony, logwood, and 
different dyewoods. One tree of mahogany is sometimes 
sold for $10,000.

sugar and liquors. 
to. Commerce, All of the productions are exportec 
nearly all the commerce is with Great Britain. 
iz, Animals. The wild animals are the deer, * 
cupines, sloths, gluttons, ant-eaters, armadillos anc 
Here are also enormous lizards, tarantulas, cent! 
snakes, 
12. Improvements. There are but few public roads, and 
until recently no railroads. Much of the merchandise is car- 
ried on the backs of mules. 
13. Inhabitants. a. Mace. The inhabitants arc 
Spanish and Indian origin. Spanish is the langu: 
country. The coast lowlands of Mexico are almos: 
itable because of the unhealthy climate; there: 
tenths of the people live in the Tierra Templad:. 
lands. : 
b. Occupations. Mining and agriculture are the chief occu 
pations. . 
14. Government, Mexico consists of twenty-seven states, 
one territory, and a: federal district. The government is 
* modeled after that of the United States; but M~*-- * | 
as prosperous, because the government has not b . 
administered. . 
15. Cities. Mexico, the capital and largest city 
in a beautiful valley, surrounded by snow-capped 
and volcanoes. Vera Cruz, the “city of the tru 
situated in an unhealthy region, but is quite prc 
cause it is the chief port on the Gulf. Puebla,ie Laue 
city of angels,” because of its beautiful situation, is noted fo:

its numerous and elegant churches. Guadalajara is next to 
the largest city. Acapulco is the principal port on the Pacific 
coast. 
16, Language and Object Lessons. Read “Montezuma” 
or “The Life of Cortez” for an account of the old city of 
Mexico and its capture. These books will furnish delightful 
stories for reproduction. Describe the capture of Monterey 
and Mexico during the Mexican War. Compare Mexico with 
the United States and British America. Describe the adobe 
houses and the Mexican manner of life. Continue to gather 
pictures and newspaper items, and compare them with those 
gathered in reference to the polar regions. Give the usual 
object lessons on the animals and productions.

volcano,”” and Fuego, “fire-volcano.” It is said that about 
eighty earthquakes occur each year, in some of which cities 
have been buried in ruins, and whole tribes of people de- 
stroyed. There are more than twenty active volcanoes-on 
the Pacific coast.

In regard to all these topics Central America is similar to 
Mexico. 
7. Government. Central America consists of five inde- 
pendent republics and the colony of Balize or British Hondu- 
ras. Great Britain and the United States bind themselves 
by treaty “not to occupy or colonize any part of Central 
America.” Balize, by special stipulation, is left for British 
occupancy for the cutting of mahogany and logwood. It is 
understood, also, that the United States is to have control 
of all isthmus transit routes, whether railways or ship-canals. 
8, Cities. New Guatemala is the capital of Guatemala and 
is situated near the site of the old city, which was destroyed 
by an earthquake in which 40,000 inhabitants perished. The 
houses. now have only one story, and walls three feet thick. 
Tegucigalpa is the capital of Honduras, and in its vicinity are 
rich mines of gold, silver and copper. San Salvador, the 
capital of Salvador, is situated in the midst of indigo and to- 
bacco plantations. Managua is the capital of Nicaragua and 
built on the slope of an active volcano, San José is the cap- 
ital of Costa Rica. Balize is the capital of Balize.

are the crest of a partly submerged mountain-range. They 
are divided into three groups: 1, the Bahamas, south-east of 
Florida; 2, The Greater Antilles, including the four large is- 
lands of Cuba, Hayti, Jamaica, and Porto Rico; 3, The 
Lesser Antilles, extending southeast from Porto Rico to the

mountainous. Of the 600 Bahamas only 17 are inhabited. 
The remainder are so low that occasionally the waves of the 
sea sweep over them. All of the Lesser Antilles are rugged 
and most of them are volcanic. 
a. Natural Curiosities. Pitch Lake on the island of Trini- 
dad is remarkable. It is one and one-half miles in circumfer- 
ence and of unknown depth. On the sides the pitch is hard 
and cold, but the center is in a liquid state, yielding asphal- 
tuin or mineral tar. The hardened asphaltum is used in paving 
the streets of Paris and other cities. There are also a number 
of mud-volcanoes on and near this island. 
4. Lakes and Rivers. They are small mountain-torrents 
with wide mouths. 
5. Soil. The soil is remarkably fertile. 
6. Climate. The climate is usually hot and moist, though 
the heat is moderated by refreshing sea-breezes. There are 
two seasons, a wet and dry. In the summer the islands are 
visited by terrible storms, called hurricanes. These storms 
are generally preceded by a calm, which is followed by light-

ning, thunder, rain, hail and terrible blasts of wind. Every- 
thing is swept before them. 
7. Productions. a. Agricultural. These consist of all 
kinds of tropical fruits, sugar-cane, coffee, cotton, tobacco and 
forests of valuable woods. 
b. Mineral. Most of the islands are rich in all kinds of 
minerals. Cuba is noted for coal, Turks Island for salt, 
Jamaica for lead, Isle of Pines for beautiful colored marbles. 
c. Manufactured. ‘These are chiefly sugar, molasses, and 
cigars. The tobacco of Cuba is considered the finest in the 
world. 
8. Commerce. The commerce is valuable and chiefly car- 
ried on with the United States, England and Spain. Besides 
the productions already mentioned, the exports include spon- 
ges, coral and green turtles. 
g. Animals. Wild boars, monkeys, lizards and beautiful 
birds are abundant. Reptiles and insects are the pests of the 
islands. The ladies of Cuba use the lightning beetles as orna- 
ments for their hair. 
10. Inhabitants. a. ace. Most of the inhabitants are 
negroes ; the remainder are Spaniards. 
b. Occupation. The people are generally industrious. 
Raising tropical fruits, sugar-cane and tobacco is the leading 
industry. Sponge-fishing is also an important occupation. 
11. Government. Hayti and San Domingo are indepen- 
dent republics. Cuba, Porto Rico and the Isle of Pines 
belong to Spain. The Bahamas, Jamaica and most of the 
Lesser Antilles belong to Great Britain. The remainder to 
France, Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. 
12. Cities, Havana is the capital and chief city of Cuba. 
It is one of the largest and richest cities in America; has one 
of the best harbors in the world; is the greatest sugar-market 
in the world; is the second city in the western hemisphere in

Columbus. Port au Prince is the capital of Hayti. Santo 
Domingo is the oldest town on the western continent, founded 
in 1494. Kingston is the capital of Jamaica, Puerto Prin- 
cipe is the largest town in the interior of Cuba, noted for its 
narrow and filthy streets. Santiago is an unhealthy place, but 
has a fine harbor. San Juan is the capital of Porto Rico. 
Matanzas is a commercial city of Cuba. Nassau on New 
Providence Island is the capital of the Bahama Islands. 
13. History. The first land seen by Columbus on his first 
voyage was one of the Bahamas. Cat, Watlings and Samana 
lay claim. to the honor. The last was probably the one. He 
also discovered Cuba on that voyage. The island was then very 
populous but nearly all the natives have since been absorbed. 
by the Spaniards. Porto Rico was discovered by Columbus 
on his second voyage. 
14. Language and Object Lessons. Contrast “ Life and 
Nature under the Tropics” with “Life and Nature at the 
Poles.’? Compare the pictures of the different regions. De-

1s. History. New England was first settled by the Puri- 
tans, who fled from England on account of religious persecu- 
tion. They came over in the Mayflower, and landed at 
Plymouth, December 22d, 1620. The first settlement in Con- 
necticut was made by emigrants from Massachusetts in 1636 3 
and during the same year Roger Williams made a settlement 
in Rhode Island. Vermont was also settled by people from 
Massachusetts. Maine and New Hampshire were originally 
a part of Massachusetts. For the first few years the colonists 
suffered from hunger and cold; during this time fortunately 
the Indians were their friends. Later the colonists had two 
wars with the Indians, known as King Philip’s and the Pequod. 
The first battles of the Revolution, Lexington and Bunker 
Hill, were fought in Massachusetts,

flood flowing through rich “bottom lands.” Much of the 
surrounding country is below the level of the river at high wa- 
ter. The river is held in its place by high banks called levees. 
These sometimes break away, when the river floods the country, 
doing much damage. Flowing through the broad delta of the 
Mississippi are many secondary outlets called bayous. The 
mouth of the river is being extended out in the Gulf of Mexico 
at the rate of several feet a year. The delta now extends one 
hundred miles into the Gulf.

Croix, St. Clair, Detroit. 
6. Soil. These states contain most fertile soil. 
7. Climate. The climate is marked by great extremes, 
Tornadoes and blizzards frequently sweep over the prairie region. 
This region is not considered unhealthy, because the air is so 
dry and pure. 
8. Productions. a. Agricultural, This section, with the 
West Central States, is the greatest agricultural region in the 
United States, producing large quantities of wheat, corn, oats, 
barley, rye, potatoes, tobacco, fruits, cattle, sheep, hogs. In 
Michigan and Wisconsin are large forests of pine, button-wood 
black walnut, etc. 
b. Mineral. The iron and copper deposits of Lake Superior 
rank among the best in the world. Large fields of bituminous 
or soft coal are found in nearly all the western states. Lead, 
salt, and petroleum are also found. : 
c. Manufactured. The manufactures are extensive, and 
consist chiefly of agricultural implements, furniture, lumber and 
machinery. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois are ranking among the first 
states in the Union in the value of their manufactures. 
g. Commerce. Commerce is carried on by means of canals, 
rivers, lakes andrailroads. The lake trade is very large. There 
are many canals; the chief ones are the Ohio, the Wisconsin, 
connecting the Fox and Wisconsin, and one connecting Chicago 
with the Illinois River.

Mississippi river valley. Kansas City is a railway center. 
Locate also St. Joseph. 
Arkansas. Little Rock is the capital and largest city. 
Louisiana. Baton Rouge is the capital. New Orleans, the 
“Crescent City,” is the largest. None of the houses have 
cellars, because the city is built on marshy ground. The city 
is protected from the high water of the Mississippi by levees, 
which are from fifteen to fifty feet wide on top, thus furnishing 
delightful promenades. It is the leading cotton-market in the 
world, and the greatest sugar-market in the United States.

colored rocks, But nowhere in the world are so many inter- 
esting objects crowded into one small space as in the 
National Park. It is 65 miles long and 55 wide, and has 
been set aside as a national pleasure-ground. “Here are 
mountains and valleys; beautiful lakes, deep cafions, and 
lofty cataracts; thundering geysers and peaceful rivers; lakes 
of mud and transparent waters; petrified forests, mineral 
springs; everything that is grand and sublime.” There are 
1,000 geysers and hot springs, one of them, the Giantess, 
sending up jets of hot water 250 feet high. The Gates of 
the Rocky Mountains are narrow gorges through which the 
Missouri flows. The river is here only 450 feet wide, flowing 
between perpendicular walls of rocks 1,200 feet high, and 
there is only one place where a foothold can be obtained. 
The Falls of Missouri are also noted.

thus described: “It embraces the most rugged mountains in _ 
the United States, their tops covered with perpetual snow, 
looking down ‘upon deserts scorched by the summer sun; 
volcanic fires bursting from cones of eternal ice; valleys 
of unbounded fertility, and large spaces of desolate rock ; 
mighty rivers of fresh water finding their way to the sea; salt 
seas imprisoned between rocky, barren wastes ; ridges of ever- 
lasting sterility, yet sparkling with. a profusion of choice miner- 
als.” How interesting this can be made for the children. 
Urge them to read about such scenery and gather items to be 
told in the classroom. Read travels and show pictures.

c. Plains, The pampas of La Plata resemble our prairies. 
During the wet season they are covered with a rich vegeta- 
tion, but during the dry season they become parched and dry. 
The selvas of the Amazon are the most extensive forest- 
regions in the world. So dense are they that it is almost 
impossible to penetrate them. The whole is so completely 
interwoven with climbing vines that it would be impossible to 
pull one tree away from the rest. The llanos of the Orinoco 
during the rainy season are covered with the finest vegeta- 
tion, where are found millions of horses, cattle and reptiles. 
In the dry season the cattle goto the mountains, but the 
alligators and snakes bury themselves in the mud and remain 
in.atorpid state until the return of the rainy season. 
d. Natural Curiosities. Mount Pichincha in Ecuador is 
called “‘the boiling mountain,” and has a crater 2,500 feet 
deep. Cotopaxi sends up flames from its summit one-half 
mile in height, while the roar can be heard 600 miles. There 
are waterfalls in the Andes of 800 feet. At the return of the 
rainy season, in the Ilanos of the Orinoco, the moistened clay 
is seen to rise slowly, then with a noise like that of a small 
mud-volcano, the earth is cast high in the air and there comes 
forth a huge snake or a scaly alligator.

It has 1500 navigable tributaries, The tide is seen 400 miles 
from its mouth, while the fresh water of the Amazon is 
noticed 200 miles out at sea. Sometimes a tide-wave from 
15 to 20 feet high rushes up the river with a roar that can be 
heard many miles, and with such velocity that it destroys ail

small boats in its way. On this account it has oftentimes 
been called the “ boat destroyer.” Here we find the Victoria 
Regia, the largest of water lilies. The center is yellow; the 
inner petals are rose-colored ; the rest is snowy white. The 
flowers are sometimes twelve inches in diameter, while the 
leaves of the plant are eight or ten feet in diameter. 
The other rivers are the Orinoco, meaning coiled serpent, 
the La Plata, meaning river of silver, the Parana, Uruguay 
and Madeira, During the rainy season the head-waters of 
the rivers are so connected that a boat can enter the Orinoco, 
and come out on either the Amazon or La Plata. The Cas- 
siquiare connects the Orinoco and Amazon. 
7. Soil. Owing to the warm climate and amount of rain- 
fall, the soil is everywhere fertile. : 
8. Climate. Near the equator the temperature is always 
that of summer. Here reptiles, insects and vegetation mul- 
tiply rapidly, so that the ripened fruit and opening blossoms 
can be found together. In the elevated plains throughout 
the year the temperature is like that of spring. Higher up 
the mountains it is always winter. 
g. Productions. a. Agricultural, These are the same as 
in Central America and West Indies. Here also is found 
Peruvian bark, from which quinine is made; the manioc plant, 
from which is made tapioca; and India-rubber in large quan- 
tities. A tree is found, which, when tapped, yields a juice 
white as milk. It is called the cow-tree and is highly prized. 
b. Afinerals. Brazil at one time furnished nearly all the 
diamonds in the world. Emerald, iron, copper, lead and coal 
are found in the Andes. 
ro. Commerce. About one-fifth of the exports come to the 
United States. The exports are the productions already 
mentioned, also, hides, horns and tallow from the llanos of 
the Orinoco, and guano and nitre from Peru.

a1, Improvements. There is great need of many improve- 
ments, although in some parts, particularly in the Argentine 
Republic, there are several thousand miles of railway. The 
roads in the Andes Mountains are very dangerous. Travel- 
lers are carried from place to place in chairs fastened to the 
backs of Indians. Threshing is done by making horses and 
cattle gallop over the grain. 
zz, Animals. The animals are the tapir, the ant-eater, 
llama, jaguar, alpaca, monkey, alligator, condor, parrot and 
beautiful birds. The llama is used among the Andes Moun- 
tains for the purpose of carrying goods. It is so sure-footed 
that it can travel in places. where other animals could not. 
13. Inhabitants. The greater part of the inhabitants are 
descendants of the native Indians, and only partly civilized. 
Mining and stock-raising are the chief employments. Nature 
has done so much for this country that the people do but 
little. 
14. Government. South America includes ten republics 
and the three colonies of Guiana. The republics are 
Brazil, Venezuela, United States of Colombia, Ecuador, 
Peru, Bolivia, Chili, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentine Re- 
public. 
15. Characteristics. Brazil is the largest country in South 
America, containing nearly one-half of the whole area, It is 
larger than the United States if we do not include Alaska. 
Nearly all of the India rubber, and three-fourths of the world’s 
coffee comes from here. Here is the cow-tree; by tapping 
it the natives get a milk-like juice to drink. 
The United States of Colombia borders on two oceans and 
includes the Isthmus of Panama. It exports Peruvian bark 
which is the bark of the cinchona tree. 
Venezuela was the earliest discovered portion of South 
America. The Indians of Lake Maracaybo build their houses

on posts driven into the bottom of the lake. This reminded 
the Spaniards of Venice, so they called the country Venezuela 
or Little Venice. 
Guiana belongs to three different powers of Europe. 
Ecuador means equator, and was so called because crossed * 
by it. . 
Peru is noted for the wealth of its mines and for its numer- 
ous ruins of the empire of the Incas. 
Bolivia is an inland country rich in minerals. The India- 
rubber of Bolivia is the finest in the world. 
Chili is a narrow strip of country stretching along the 
Pacific Ocean for 3,000 miles, Silver was discovered there 
accidentally by an Indian, and was very common a few years 
ago. 
The Argentine Republic is next to Brazil in size. It is 
growing rapidly in population and commercial enterprise, 
and is one of the most important countries in South America. 
It contains the pampas, which are subject to the “ pamperos,” 
sudden and violent gusts of winds, which sweep over them 
with great fury. 
Paraguay is an unimportant country having no sea-coast. 
Uruguay is the smallest of the South American countries. 
Cattle-raising is the chief employment. 
16. Cities. Brazil. Rio Janeiro is the capital and one of 
the most important cities in South America and the largest 
coffee-market in the world. Bahia, Pernambuco, now called 
Recife, and Para, now called Belem, are commercial cities. 
United States of Colombia, Bogota is the capital and larg- 
est city. Colon and Panama are important ports. 
Venezuela, Caracas is the capital and largest city. La 
Guayra is the seaport. Maracaybo and Angostura, now 
called Bolivar, are important cities. 
Guianas. Georgetown, Paramaribo and Cayenne are the

capitals, From® Cayenne we get Cayenne pepper. French 
Guiana is used as a colony for prisoners. 
Ecuador. Quito, the capital and largest city, is situated 
nearly on the equator, but because of its high elevation it has 
a delightful climate. Guayaquil is the princival seaport. 
Peru, Lima is the capital and Callao .s its port. Pasco 
is one of the highest cities on the globe. All the cities in 
Peru and Ecuador suffer from earthquakes. 
Bolivia. La Paz is the largest city and chief trading 
center. Sucre is the capital. Potosi is noted for its silver 
mines. 
* Chili, Santiago is the capital. Valparaiso is the chief 
seaport of South America on the Pacific coast. 
Argentine Republic. Buenos Ayres is the capital. Itis the 
largest city in South America. Cordova is a center of trade. 
faraguay. Asuncion is the capital. 
Uruguay. Montevideo is the capital. 
17. History. South America wa's discovered by Columbus 
on kis third voyage, near the mouth of the Orinoco river. 
The following year t Spanish explorers visited the shores, 
among whom was erigo Vespuci after whom the whole 
country was named. Balboa, a Spaniard, crossed the Isth- 
mus of Darien and first saw the Pacific Ocean. The waters 
were called Pacific, meaning peaceful, but they are subject to 
violent storms. In 1520 Magellan passed through the strait 
that bears his name. He died before he reached home, but 
his fleet was the first to circumnavigate the globe. 
18. Language and Object Lessons. Show what would have 
been the effect had the Andes been placed on the eastern 
coast. From that show how important the mountains are in 
determining the whole vegetable and animal life of the coun. 
try. Read about the Incas, who were overthrown by Pizarro 
when he conquered Peru. Compare South America with

North America in respect to shape, size, and population, 
Describe the Andes and the Plains. Compare the seasons of 
South and North America. Compare the Indians of Patago- 
nia with those of the United States or the Arctic regions. 
Compare the forests of Brazil with those of the United States. 
Name the vegetable productions and describe their uses. 
Describe the animals in the same way. Notice the adapta- 
tions of animals by structure and coverings to their surround- 
ings. Notice the different kinds of food which limit their 
migrations, 
GRADE VII. 
To the Teacher. Geography well taught cultivates the im- 
agination and judgment as well as the memory, and trains the 
powers of observation and language. No other branch in the 
grammar-school course gives opportunity for culture in so 
many directions. In no other subject is it so necessary to 
be independent of the text-book. We must put life and 
color into the dry facts and give for the memory-lessons only 
intelligent summaries of the important facts. We, teachers, 
should tell a pupil nothing that he can find out for himself, 
but his study should be supplemented by bits of information, 
descriptions and illustrations. All this is not an easy matter. 
It demands that the teacher shall be at home in all lands, 
acquainted with the world’s great industries and inventions. 
Examine the suggestions for language work given to the 
previous grades, and continue similar work throughout the 
year. The gathering of pictures and daily news and placing 
them on file for future reference is not a small matter, but of 
vital importance to the interest and success of geography 
teaching, Progressive map-drawing should form an import- 
ant part of every recitation. The pupils should be taught to 
solor outline maps, showing the different elevations and

fertility of soil. Give them also outline maps on which to} 
indicate the productions of the different localities. Modeling| 
in sand, clay, putty or plaster of Paris should be practiced as 
often as possible. Urge the pupils to collect the different 
productions of the different countries. These should be care- 
fully labeled and kept in a museum for use when needed. 
The Topics—soil, wind-currents, ocean-currents, climate, 
animals and occupations should be studied. Each country 
should be carefully compared with all the others, 
I. — Europe. 
Mould the continent in sand, clay or putty, for the purpose 
of studying its relief. 
1. Position. Its northern boundary lies within the North 
Frigid Zone. The remainder is within the Temperate Zone. 
It is the only grand division which nowhere touches the 
Torrid Zone. . 
2. Extent. It is the smallest, but one of the grand divi- 
sions, being about equal in area to the United States, yet it 
surpasses all the others in wealth, intelligence and general 
civilization. 
3. Coast. Europe is much indented by large bodies of 
water so that few parts are more than 300 miles from the 
coast. These indentations not only provide excellent har- 
bors, but also tend to make the‘climate milder. 
a. Oceans. Arctic, Atlantic. 
b. Seas. White, Baltic, North, Mediterranean, Kara, Adri- 
atic, Aegéan or Archipelago, Black, Caspian, Marmora, Azov, 
Irish. The Caspian Sea is the largest salt lake in the world. 
On the western shore of this sea is the “ Field of Fire.” Jets 
of flame spring from the ground, caused by gases coming out 
of the earth. :

St. Vincent, Matapan, Land’s End, Clear. 
h. eninsulas. Scandinavian, Iberian, Balkan, Italian, 
Jutland, Crimea. 
4. Surface. All of eastern Europe is a low plain, the 
Valdai Hills being the highest land. Most of this plain is 
but little above the level of the sea. The western part of 
Europe is high and mountainous. 
a. Mountain Ranges. Alps, Vosges, Jura, Cevennes, Ap- 
pennines, Carpathian, Balkan, Caucasus, Ural, Scandinavian. 
b. Peaks. Elbrooz, 17,700 feet high, is on the line be- 
tween Europe and Asia. Mt. Blanc is the highest peak 
wholly in Europe. Other peaks are Matterhorn, Aetna, 
Vesuvius, Stromboli. The last three are active volcanoes. 
Vesuvius had an eruption, more than eighteen hundred years 
ago, which buried several cities in ashes. Parts of these cities 
have recently been uncovered and many curious things are 
found. In many of the houses the tables are set for dinner 
and bread is found in the ovens. Stromboli is called the 
“Lighthouse of the Mediterranean,” because its glow can 
“be seen at night by the sailors, . 
ce. Natural Curiosities. The scenery of Switzerland is the 
finest inthe world. The loftiest peaks of the Alps are always 
covered with snow, while the valleys are filled with rivers of 
ice, called glaciers. Far up amid the everlasting snow of 
these mountains is the Monastery of St. Bernard. This 
monastery is inhabited by monks, who have trained their 
dogs to go out during the severe snow storms to rescue lost

travellers. Many lives have thus been saved. Mt. Brocken, 
the principal peak of the Hartz Mountains, is noted for a 
strange appearance, called the Spectre of Brocken. At 
certain times whatever stands on the summit is seen in a 
much larger form upon the sky. This is simply the shadow 
thrown upon the sky by the setting sun, but many ignorant 
people believe that the mountain is haunted. The lake and 
mountain scenery of all parts of Europe is picturesque and 
beautiful. Kilhorn peak, in the northern. part of Norway, has 
a large hole through it at about three-fourths of its height, 
through which the sun shines twice each day in summer. 
Why in summer? The island of Antiparos is celebrated for 
its grotto. 
5. Lakes. There are two lake-regions in Europe; one in 
Switzerland, the other in Russia and Sweden. The lal 
Switzerland are noted for their beauty ; those in Norwa! 
Sweden for their transparency. Stones can be seen ¢ 
depth of 120 feet. Europe has more lakes than any vu. 
continent except North America, but they are usually very 
small. In the northern part there are many lakes with no 
inlet ‘or outlet, yet they are not salt. Why? Ladoga is the 
largest lake in Europe. 
6. Rivers. The rivers of western Europe rise cl’ ~ 
the Alps, and are the Danube, Rhine, Rhone, Sei 
Loire, Elbe, The rivers of eastern Europe rise chief! 
*Valdai Hills, and are the Dnieper, Don, Volga, Ural 
Duna, Petchora. The Volga is the longest river in Eur 
has 70 mouths, and is connected by canals with the Whi: 
and Baltic Seas. The Rhine is remarkable for the ok 
upon its banks, built during the feudal ages. What 0.0 cue 
feudal ages? Most of the rivers of Europe are connected 
with one another by canals. 
7- Soil. With the exception of the river-valleys, the soil is
-P-A-G-E-111
TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 115 
not very fertile naturally, but by skilful cultivation it is made 
very productive. 
8. Climate. The climate of southern Europe is mild, that 
of the north is cold. The winds from the Gulf Stream make 
the climate of western and northern Europe much warmer 
than that of the remaining parts. Hammerfest, within the 
Arctic circle, is only a little colder than New York. Mar- 
seilles, France, is in nearly the same latitude as Portland, 
Maine. Around Marseilles the orange and lemon are culti- 
vated. Where are they cultivated in the United States? 
Ireland is green and beautiful, while the opposite regions of 
Labrador are snow-bound and desolate. There are no moun- 
tains to break the icy winds of the north, so that the eastern 
part is much colder than the western. The hot winds from 
the desert of Sahara, partly cooled by crossing the Mediter- 
ranean Sea, render the climate along the sea almost tropical. 
g. Animals. In different parts of Europe are found the 
following : moufflon, elk, reindeer, ibex, chamois, wild boar, 
lynx, bear, beaver,.porcupine, and wolf. 
to. Productions. a. Agricultural. Europe extends from 
the Frigid Zone almost to the Torrid Zone and therefore has 
a great variety of productions. In the far north we can find 
nothing but mosses and shrubs. In the middle of Europe 
are immense forests. In the central and southern parts are 
some of the best vineyards in the world. Along the Mediter- 
ranean also we can find tropical fruits. 
b. Mineral. Europe is not as rich in minerals as North 
America, yet it produces large quantities of coal, tin, iron, 
lead, copper, silver and gold. 
c. Manufactured, The European nations take the lead in 
manufacturing. The excellent shipping advantages, the nu- 
merous rivers furnishing water-power, the cheapness of labor, 
give them advantages for manufacturing not enjoyed by other
-P-A-G-E-112

nations. The different manufactures will be mentioned as 
we study the different nations. 
rr. Commerce. Europe ranks first in commerce. It im- 
ports provisions and raw materials to be used in manufac- 
turing. It exports chiefly manufactured articles. 
12. Natural Advantages. What are they? They have 
already been mentioned. 
13. Inhabitants. a. Race. The population of Europe is 
about 350,000,000 and is chiefly of the Aryan race. 
b. Occupation. In eastern Europe farming is the ehief 
occupation. The farms are small, but cultivated with great 
skill. Many women work in the fields. In southern Europe 
fruit-growing is the important industry. Mining and stock- 
raising are the chief employments in the mountains. In 
western Europe commerce and manufacturing are the leading 
pursuits. 
14. Political Divisions. Name them. The most powerful 
and important are Great Britain, Germany, Russia, Austria- 
Hungary, France, Italy. 
15. Cities. The largest cities are London, Paris, Berlin, 
Vienna, St. Petersburg. These x named according to their 
size. 
16. Language and Object Lessons. Arrange the divisions 
of Europe in the order of their areas, in the order of their 
population, in the order of their importance. Compare the 
people of Europe, North America and South America in 
respect to their occupation and industries. Compare Euro- 
pean nations, the United States and Canada in regard to their 
standing armies, and education. Describe the ascent of Mt. 
Blanc, the scenery, ete. Take imaginary journeys to the 
different parts of Europe from New York. Give object les-

Treland is less than one-half the size of Texas, yet the popula- 
tion is about three-fifths that of the United States. Wales is 
about the size of Massachusetts. 
3- Coast. The coasts are very irregular and the shores 
generally rocky. On the English channel there are high and 
chalky cliffs, whose white appearance gave the island the 
name of Albion, “ white,” in ancient times. 
"a, Ocean, Atlantic. 
b. Seas. North, Irish. 
c. Guifs, Bays. Nearly all the important rivers have wide 
mouths resembling bays. Locate Bristol Channel, Cardigan, 
Solway Firth, Firth of Clyde, Moray Firth, Firth of Tay, Firth 
of Forth, The Wash, Galway, Donegal.

f. Zsdands, There are here 5,500 islands but most of them 
are small and rocky. The Isle of Man contains a population 
that still use a peculiar language called Manx. The Isle of 
Wight is called the “Garden of England.” West of this island 
are the Needles and the celebrated “Needle Light-house.” 
Of the Scilly Isles, 145 in number, only six are inhabited. 
The Channel Islands, consisting of Guernsey, Jersey and 
Alderney, are noted for their mild climate, picturesque scenery, 
fruit and cattle. Of the many islands west of Scotland, only 
87 are inhabited. The leading occupation of the people is 
gathering bird’s eggs by swinging over the rocky ledges. 
Locate also Shetland, Orkney, Hebrides, Anglesea, Faroe, 
Malta.

4. Surface. The northern and western portions of England) 
are mountainous, the remainder rolling. The surface of Scot- 
land is much broken by mountain and valley, and is divided 
into Highlands and Lowlands. Ireland contains large tracts 
called bogs. The surface is generally rolling. Wales is 
mountainous. 
a. Mountain Ranges. The mountains are not high, but are 
celebrated for their picturesque scenery. Locate Cairngorm, 
Grampian, Cambrian, Cheviot. 
b. Leaks. Snowdon, Ben Lomond, Ben Nevis, The. last 
has a perpendicular precipice of 1500 feet. 
“c. Natural Curiosities, On Staffa island is the celebrated 
Fingal’s Cave. On the coast of Ireland is the Giant’s Cause- 
way. It consists of an immense mass of basalti¢ columns 
having six sides. They are perpendicular, smooth and regu- 
lar, There is an Irish legend that it was built by a race of 
giants to form a road to Scotland. It is 600 feet long. The 
lakes of Killarney are celebrated for their scenery. Here 
.Sullivan’s Cascade falls from a height of 70 feet into the lake 
with a terrible roar. Here also is the “ Devil’s Punch-Bowl,” 
a circular lake at the summit of a mountain, from which a 
stream of water pours down the mountain side. There are 
many supposed ruins of the temples of the Druids, the priests 
of the ancient Britons, and also ruins of the Roman occupation 
and the feudal ages. 
5. Lakes. The lakes are small but beautiful, Besides 
the Lakes of Killarney, locate Loch Lomond, Windermere, 
and Loch Katrine. This last one is described, in Scott’s poem, 
“The Lady of the Lake.” 
6. Rivers. All are small, but flow into wide estuaries, 
Locate Thames, Severn, Mersey, Humber, Clyde, Tweed. 
Shannon, Great Ouse. There are numerous canals, the most 
important being the Caledonian. ~
-P-A-G-E-115
TOPICS IN GEOGRAPRY. 119g 
7. Soil. The soil is fertile, and diligent cultivation has 
made it very productive. The moist climate of Ireland keeps 
it so remarkably green that it is called the Emerald Isle. 
8. Climate. The climate is mild. The water that sur- 
rounds the islands moderates the cold of winter and the heat 
of summer. Snow seldom remains on the ground more than 
two or three days. The climate of Wales is colder than that 
of England. 
9. Productions. a. Agricudtural, Flax and potatoes are 
the leading crops of Ireland. Wheat, rye, barley and oats 
also grow here. 
b, Minerals. The British Isles surpass every other coun- 
try in the production of salt, iron, coal and tin. 
c, Manufactured. The English excel in the manufacture 
of hardware, heavy machinery, railroad iron, cutlery and cot- 
ton goods. Great Britain surpasses all other countries in the 
extent and variety of her manufactures. 
xo, Commerce. In the extent of her commerce Great 
Britain excels every other country on the globe. The five 
principal exports are cotton goods, iron and steel, woolen and 
linen goods, and coal, The five principal imports are grain, 
cotton, sugar, wool, wood and timber. 
11. Internal improvements. The public roads are among 
the best in the world. Railroads cross the country in every 
direction. 
12, Inhabitants. a. Race. There are three classes of 
people in Great Britain: the nobility, gentry or middle class, 
and the working class. The English are robust, fond of 
domestic life and athletic amusements. The Welsh are in- 
dustrious and frugal, The Scotch have displayed great genius 
in history, philosophy and poetry. The Irish are noted for 
wit, cheerfulness and warmth of heart. 
b. Occupation. The leading occupations are manufactur

ing, commerce and mining. Many, of course, are engaged 
in agriculture. 
13. Government. It is a limited hereditary monarchy. 
The laws are made by Parliament, which consists of a House 
of Lords and House of Commons. The House of Lords is 
composed of lords who inherit their seats; the House of 
Commons is composed of men elected by the people. The 
highest power is placed in a king or queen. Queen Victoria 
is the present ruler. 
14. Education. The means for education among the 
poorer classes are not sufficient. The people of Scotland are 
noted for their superior schools and universities. 
15. Foreign Possessions. _The principal possessions of 
Great Britain are as follows: Gibraltar and Malta in Europe; 
British India, Ceylon, Cyprus, Singapore, Aden and Hong 
Kong in Asia; Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand in 
Oceania ; Cape Colony, Natal, and the Niger Delta in Africa; 
Canada, Newfoundland, Jamaica and other West India Is- 
lands, British Guiana, British Honduras and the Falkland 
islands in America.- 
16. Chief Characteristics. It is the most powerful and 
populous empire in the world. It ranks first in commerce 
and naval power. 
17. Cities. London is the capital of the British Empire and 
the largest and wealthiest city in the world. It contains 
many elegant public and private buildings. The atmosphere 
is often dimmed with smoke, and in winter the smoke and 
fog together make it necessary sometimes to light the street- 
lamps in the day-time, and even then it is impossible at times 
to find one’s way around. 
Glasgow, the next city in size, is situated in the midst of 
coal and iron mines, and is noted for its manufactures. 
Liverpool is an important seaport, whose commerce is

almost equal to all the other seaports together. Manchester 
is the first city in the world in the manufacture of cotton 
goods. Birmingham is noted for its hardware manufactories. 
Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland, noted for its 
silk manufactures. Leeds is noted for its woolen goods; 
Sheffield for its cutlery. Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, 
is a great center of learning and education. Bristol, Ports- 
mouth and Hull are leading seaports. Belfast and Dundee 
are noted for their linen. Oxford and Cambridge are the 
seats of old and renowned universities. Nottingham is cele- 
vrated for its laces; Newcastle for its coal; Paisley for its 
manufacture of shawls and carpets. Cardiff is the seaport 
and largest city of Wales. Merthyr Tydfil is noted for its 
iron-works. 
18, Language and Object Lessons. In stories and travels 
visit the different parts of the British Isles. Compare its 
cities and scenery with those of the United States. Weave 
into stories the simplest points of English history. Sir Walter 
Scott’s “Lady of the Lake” could be profitably read and 
studied here. In what respect is the Thames a greater river 
than the Amazon? Read about Guy Fawkes, bird-catching 
on the islands, etc.

a. Mountain Ranges. Kiolen, Dovrefield. 
b. Curiosities, There are numerous rivers, all of which 
have beautiful cataracts, varying in height from 100 to 1,000 
feet. The Maelstrom is a famous whirlpool in the southern 
part of the Loffoden islands. Most of the time vessels can 
sail across it, but when the wind and tide are opposed to each 
other, the water is lashed into violent fury. It is then 
dangerous for ships to approach it. Kilhorn Peak has been 
described. . 
5. Lakes. Nearly one-eighth of the surface is covered by 
Jakes. Wener is the largest and third in size in Europe. 
6. Rivers, These are too numerous to mention. Most of 
them flow through deep ravines, probably worn by glaciers. 
7. Soil. The greater part is fertile, but not productive. 
8. Climate. The climate of the western coast is kept mild 
by the Gulf Stream, so that the harbor at Hammerfest is 
seldom frozen, The eastern coast has very cold winters. 
9. Productions. a. Agricultural. Barley, rye and oats 
grow in the southern part. 
b. Mineral. There are rich mines of copper, iron and 
lead. Large quantities of building-stones are exported. 
ro. Inhabitants. a. ace. The people are noted for their 
intelligence, industry and independence. 
b. Occupations, Norway takes the lead of all countries in

in beautiful scenery. The ruins of its cities and public works 
are of great interest and worth studying. The Blue Grotto 
of Capri is on an island in the bay of Naples. It can be en- 
tered only by a canoe, through an arch about a yard high. 
The Grotto is about forty feet high and the walls and roof are 
of a beautiful color. Near Naples is a cave, the floor of 
which is covered with carbonic acid gas, a deadly poison to 
anyone entering it. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is 179 feet 
high, and leans thirteen feet from the perpendicular. 
5. Lakes. The lakes are small, numerous, and picturesque. 
Como is the most celebrated. Many of them are craters of 
extinct volcanoes, now filled with water.

noted for its rich collections of paintings and statues. Ven- 
ice is the chief commercial city on the Adriatic. It is built 
on seventy islands connected by more than five hundred brid- 
ges. the most noted of which is called the Rialto. Canals 
are used in place of streets, and gondolas in place of car- 
riages, because the streets are so narrow. Palermo is an impor- 
tant commercial city noted for its shipbuilding. Other large 
cities are Messina, Bologna, Leghorn, Catania and Pisa. 
San Marino is a Republic. It is the smauies. and one of the 
oldest of the European States. .

from the peninsula of Kamchatka to the island of Java. They
-P-A-G-E-143
TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 147 
contain many active volcanoes. Most of these islands are 
large and productive. The larger ones are those of the Japan- 
ese empire, Formosa, Hainan, Ceylon, Saghalin, New 
Siberia. Malaysia comprises the continental islands south- 
east of the mainland of Asia. These will be described under 
the topic Oceania. 
g. Peninsulas. These are Arabia, Hindoostan, Malay, 
Corea, Kamchatka, Asia Minor. ~ 
4. The surface consists of mountains, plateaus, deserts and 
plains, In the northern part isa Great Plain, including the 
‘Tundras of Siberia, and also vast forests and rolling prairies. 
The central portion consists of desert plateaus and mountains. 
The southern part consists of peninsulas, comprising table- 
lands, valleys and plains. The greater partof Asia is mountain- 
ous and the grand division as a whole is several hundred feet 
higher than any other. 
a. Mountain Ranges. In Asia we find the loftiest range of 
mountains in the world, viz., the Himalaya, “the abode of 
snow.” Here also we find the Altai, “Golden Mountains,”’ 
Hindoo Koosh, Thian Shan, Taurus. 
b. Peaks. The various ranges comprising the Himalaya 
Mountains contain more than forty peaks over 25,000 feet high. 
Mt. Everest is 29,000 feet high. It is probably the highest 
peak in the world. In the regions near Palestine are many 
mountains, interesting because of sacred historical incidents 
connected with them. On Mt, Horeb, God appeared to Moses 
and commanded him to deliver his countrymen; on Sinai God 
delivered to Moses the law; on Ararat Noah’s ark rested after 
the flood. Other peaks are Hermon, Carmel, Nebo. 
c. Plains. The Pamir Plateau, called the “Roof of the 
World,” is the highest plateau on the globe. The Desert of 
Gobi, i. ., “sea of sand,” is a barren sandy plain twelve hun- 
dred miles long and from five hundred to seven hundred miles
-P-A-G-E-144
148 TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 
wide in the plateau of Mongolia. Other plateaus are those of 
Thibet, Iran, and Arabia. The last two contain several deserts. 
The plateau of Thibet is inhabited by a colony of Buddhist 
priests. As their settlement is sixteen thousand feet above the 
level of the sea, it is probably the highest inhabited point in 
the world. 
d. Interesting Objects. Western Asia is full of scenes and 
places connected with Bible history. Besides the mountains 
already noticed, might be mentioned the “Garden of Eden,” 
and Babylon. The Wall of China is 1250 miles long, nearly as 
long as the distance from Boston to the Mississippi river, It is 
thirty feet high and fifteen feet wide at the top. Watch-towers 
are built every three hundred feet. It was built 215 B. C., and 
is said to have taken several million men five years to build it. 
5. Lakes, The lakes of Asia are small and usually salt. 
Balkash and Baikal are the largest. These are about twice the 
size of Ontario, or about .one-half the size of Maine. Lake 
Baikal is noted for the violent and sudden storms that sweep 
overit Locate also the Aral Sea. 
6. Rivers. The northern and southern portions have many 
rivers, The Obi, Yenisei and Lena are the large rivers of the 
Arctic slope. Why are they of no commercial importance 
although they are sometimes five miles wide? Yang-tse-Kiang 
is the largest river in Asia. It is called by the Chinese the 
“Son of the Ocean.” The Hoang-Ho or Yellow is called 
“China's sorrow,” on account of damage to property and life 
done by it. It is constantly changing its course. The Ganges 
has eighty mouths. It annually overflows its banks, so that all 
the surrounding country is covered with water. It is said to be 
navigated by more vessels than any other river in the world. 
The other principal rivers are Amoo, Amoor, Brahmapootra, 
Cambodia, Euphrates, Tigris, Indus, Irrawaddi, and Mekong. 
Some of the rivers of Asia, like the Amazon, are subject ta
-P-A-G-E-145

hores. That of the Tsein-tsang is the largest in the world. 
Waves thirty feet high rush up the river at the rate of twenty- 
five miles an hour. 
7. Soil. India, Farther India and part of China are very” 
fertile ; the rest of Asia is either a mountain, a desert, or situa- 
ted too far north for cultivation. 
8. Climate. The temperature varies from many degrees 
below zero in the north to 125 degrees above zero near the 
Persian Gulf. Mecca is regarded as one of the hottest places 
on the earth’s surface, while Irkootsk is said to be the coldest 
inhabited place in the world. In the southern parts of Asia 
the monsoons or “season” winds blow from the land for six 
months, causing six months of drought; during the remaining 
six months they blow from the sea, deluging the land with 
fain. Owing to this variety of climate, Siberia is called the 
coldest, Arabia the hottest, and India the wettest country in 
the world. 
9. Productions. a. Agricultural. These are as varied as 
the climate. We find only mosses in the north, but tropical 
fruits in the south. Most of the food-plants, now found in all 
parts of the world, originally came from Asia. Most of our 
choice garden-flowers also came from Asia. Nearly all the tea 
used in the world comes from Asia, and the finest coffee comes 
from Arabia. The tropical portions of Asia are renowned for 
their spices, Arabia for its coffee, and China and Japan for 
their tea and rice. 
b. Mineral, Asia is noted for its precious minerals. Large 
diamonds are found in India ; sapphires, rubies and emeralds in 
Burmah. Gold, silver, iron, tin and quicksilver are also found. 
c. Manufactured, The different nations of Asia excel in the 
manufacture of certain articles. “These will be spoken of under 
the different political divisions. All of the people of Asia 
object to machinery so that all of their work is done by hand.

in Europe, and also the rhinoceros, elephant, lion, tiger, wild 
hog, yak, gazelle, hyena, tapir, buffalo, goat, sheep, monkey, 
etc. All of these are natives of Asia, as well as the horse, 
camel, ox, and all our barnyard fowls. 
tr. Races. Three races are found in Asia, the Caucasian, 
Mongolian and Malay ; or called by modern classification, the 
Aryan and Turanic races. The Mongolian and Malay are 
divisions of the latter. 
12. Occupation. The people are largely engaged in agri- 
culture. The pearl-fisheries on the south-eastern coast and 
among the islands are very valuable. 
13. Political Divisions. Name them. 
14. Cities. The cities have narrow, crooked and filthy 
streets. There are over fifteen cities, each having a population 
of more than 500,000. ‘Several cities in China have a popula- 
tion of over 1,000,000. The largest cities are Pekin, Canton, 
Calcutta, Tokio and Bombay. 
15. Language and Object Lessons. While moulding the

St, Petersburg. From Pekin to Maimaichin by camels, from 
there through Irkootsk, Tomsk and Tobolsk to St. Petersburg by 
boat in summer, and in winter by sledges drawn by dogs or 
reindeer. It takes six months for the journey. 
11. Inhabitants. Three-fourths of the inhabitants of Siberia 
are Russians. Many of them are exiles who have been ban- 
ished from Russia. The steppes in the south are occupied by 
roving Kirgheez. In the north are many barbarous tribes.

2. Extent. The empire contains four large islands, —Yezo, 
Hondo, Shikoku, Kiushiu, and also 3,850 smaller islands. 
3. Coast. The coast line of the larger islands is irregular. 
It is difficult to approach the shores because of rocks and 
shallows. 
a. Seas. Okhotsk, Japan, East China. 
b. Strait, Corea. 
4. Surface. ' Large, fertile plains border the coast, but the 
interior is high and rugged. Fujisan is the sacred mountain 
of Japan. It is the highest mountain, and was once an active 
volcano. In summer bands of pilgrims, dressed in white, 
travel to the summit to worship idols. Throughout Japan 
earthquakes are of common occurrence. In 1703 Tokio was 
lestroyed by an earthquake, when 200,000 persons perished..

5. Soil. The soil is fertile and supports a population nearly 
equal to that of the United States, although in extent it is 
only equal to the Middle Atlantic States. 
6. Climate. The climate is very mild, much more so than 
would be expected, owing to the Japan Current. Typhoons 
frequently occur. 
7. Productions. a. Agricuitural, We find here all the 
productions of the temperate and torrid zones. Rice and tea 
are the principal products. There are three celebrated trees 
in Japan. From the first the Japanese get a gum used in Japan- 
ware ; from the second they get wax for their candles; from 
the third they manufacture paper. 
b. Mineral. Gold, silver, coal, iron, tin, copper, etc., are 
abundant. 
c. Manufactured. The manufactures are similar to those 
of China and like them also are excellent in quality. The 
Japanese excel in the manufacture of steel. 
8. Commerce. Tea, silk, rice, fans, lacquered ware and 
porcelain are the chief exports. Nearly all the commerce is 
with Great Britain and the United States. 
g. Inhabitants. a. Hace. They belong to the ~~ ~ 
sion of the Turanic race, and are noted for thei 
and progressive spirit. They are rapidly adopting su. ucau 
and European'manners and customs. Public schools, col- 
leges, railroads, telephones and telegraphs have all been intro- 
duced within a few years. 
b. Occupation. Agriculture and manufacturing are the 
leading pursuits. 
10. Government. The government is a 
monarchy. The chief ruler is called the Mikauwv. 
11. Cities. Tokio is the capital and largest city of the 
empire. Yokohama is the principal seaport. Osaka and 
Kioto are large manufacturing cities. Osaka has numerous 
canals and eleven hundred bridges.

teaus. The Himalaya Mountains form the northern boundary. 
The Eastern and Western Ghauts enclose the Plateau of 
Deccan. 
5. Rivers. ‘The largest rivers are the Indus, Ganges, Brah- 
mapootra, Irrawaddy. 
6. Soil. On account of the fertility of the soil, British 
India is the richest possession owned by any nation. 
7. Climate. In the north the climate is temperate; in the 
south it is tropical. The summer heat in the plains can be 
endured only by the natives. Violent storms are frequent.

fruits and spices of the tropical regions are found here. 
Rice is the chief article of food. Hindoostan produces large 
quantities of opium. The banyan tree is celebrated ; one tree 
is said to cover seven acres. 
b. Mineral. Diamonds are found in the Deccan, Other 
minerals occur, but the mines are not worked extensively. 
c. Manufactured, Calico was first made in Calicut. In 
Burmah excellent bells are made. 
9. Commerce. This is extensive and almost wholly carried 
on with Great Britain by water and caravan. 
io. Inhabitants. They are mainly of the Caucasian or 
Aryan race, though in color nearly black. They are called 
Hindoos. They are divided into several castes. The Brah- 
mans are the highest, and they are highly educated. The 
Vedas are the sacred books of the Hindoos. By their teach- 
ings all intercourse between the different castes is forbidden. 
They are an indolent, poor, but contented race. 
s1, Government. British India is governed by a viceroy 
appointed by the crown of England. Many of the provinces 
are ruled by native princes. 
12. Cities. The cities of India are numerous and large, but 
filthy, except in the portions built by Europeans. Calcutta is 
the capital and largest city. It has the largest commerce of 
any city in Asia. Bombay is situated on an island by 
the same name, and is the second commercial city of Asia. 
Benares is the sacred city of the Hindoos and contains over 
one thousand pagan temples. Delhi was once the capital of 
India, having a population of two millions. Other cities are 
Madras, Rangoon, Mandalay, Hyderabad, Lucknow and Agra.

plain, called in ancient times “ Araby the Blest.” The rest of 
Arabia is a great plateau, consisting of hills of naked rocks and 
plains of drifting sand, dotted here and there with fertile valleys 
and oases. 
4. Climate. It is very dry. On the plains the heat is un- 
bearable. Over the burning deserts sweeps the simoom, a hot 
wind.

9. Productions. We find here the grains and fruits of the 
temperate zone, and also oranges, figs, olives, and pomegranates. 
to. Inhabitants. The inhabitants are of many different 
nationalities ; the Turks are the ruling people. 
tr, Cities. Damascus is the oldest city in existence, and is 
the center of a large caravan trade. Smyrna is the commerciai 
port of Turkey. Beyrout is a seaport on the Mediterranean Sea. 
Bagdad and Aleppo are noted for their caravan trade. Jeru- 
salem was once a magnificent city, but is now of little import- 
ance except for its memories and ruins of the past. It 
contains the tomb ‘of Christ, which is visited annually by 
thousands of pilgrims. 
12. Language and Object Lessons. Describe the Jordan, 
and the ruins near it. All the mountains, hills, rivers and 
valleys are connected with scenes and events in the life of 
Christ, and for that reason are worth studying. Here was the 
ancient city of Troy. Describe its capture by the Greeks as

now is. Its history has largely determined the history of all the 
civilized world, hence it is important for all students to know 
something of it. Compare the different divisions of Asia, one

Africa should be moulded and studied in relief, the same as 
the other grand divisions, 
1, Position. Boundaries. Progressive map. 
2. Extent. Of the grand divisions, Africa is second in size. 
Its length and breadth are each about five thousand miles. Itis 
the only grand division stretching across the Torrid Zone. It 
has a hotter climate, a larger desert, larger and more numerous 
animals than any other grand division. 
3. Coast. Africa is a vast peninsula with an almost un- 
broken coastline. There are no excellent harbors and few 
navigable rivers. What effect has that had upon our knowl- 
edge of the interior? 
a. Oceans. Atlantic, Indian. 
b. Seas. Mediterranean, Red. 
c. Gulfs. Aden, Guinea, 
d. Strait, Channel. Bab-el-Mandeb, Mozambique. 
e. Isthmus. Suez. 
f. Capes. Bon, Guardafui, Agulhas, Good Hope, Verde. 
Why was the cape of Good Hope so called ? 
g. Islands. Madagascar is twice as large as Great Britain. 
It hasa fertile soil and a large population. The island furnishes 
gold, silver, lead, iron, honey, wax and silkworms. The Azores, 
a group of nine islands, produce wine, brandy, oranges and 
lemons. The Cape Verde islands consist of fifteen large and 
several small islands. The Canary Islands belong to Spain. 
The hot winds from the desert often blow across. the islands and
-P-A-G-E-161

destroy all vegetation. Here is the home of the Canary bird. 
St Helena is noted as the island to which Napoleon Bonaparte 
was exiled, and as the place of his death. Ascension Island is 
near it. East of Madagascar are several islands which produce 
Jarge quantities of coffee, sugar and spices. Of these Reunion 
or Bourbon, belonging to France, is famous for its volcano, 
which serves as a lighthouse. Mauritius belongs to England. 
4. Surface. The interior of Africa is a plateau, which is 
almost completely surrounded by mountains. The plateaus of 
the south are higher, so that the land slopes toward the north. 
a. Mountain Ranges. Atlas, Kong, Snow, Cameroon. 
b. Peaks. Killima-Njaro and Kenia are the highest. 
ce. Plains, Sahara is the largest desert on the globe. Its 
surface consists of hills and valleys covered with fragments of 
rocks, coarse gravel, hard baked earth, dry lakes covered with 
salt, and fine drifting sand. It is about the size of the United 
States. Some portions of it are below the surface of the Medi- 
terranean and it is now proposed to dig a canal to let in the 
waters of the sea, hoping to increase the amount of rainfall and 
thus make the rest of the desert fertile. If this could be ac- 
complished, the climate of France, Spain and Italy would 
undergo a great change. It would then be deprived of the 
hot winds from the desert; which now make the climate of 
those countries so tropical. There is reason to believe that at 
one time nearly all the desert was fertile and the mountains 
covered with forests. After the forests were cut down by the 
inhabitants, to enable them more easily to defend their flocks, 
the rainfall gradually ceased and then the desert began. There 
are many oases ; the largest is Fezzan, The other important 
desert isKalihari. : 
d. Curiosities. Africa has been so little explored that its 
Curiosities are not known. There are many large cataracts, 
that of Victoria is the most noted. The Zambesi river
-P-A-G-E-162
166 TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 
makes a perpendicular plunge of four hundred feet. Tab’ 
Mountain in Cape Colony is noted. Egypt abounds in ruii 
and monuments, including the celebrated pyramids. 
5- Lakes. The lakes are commercially unimportant. Dui 
ing the dry season many of the smaller ones either dry u 
entirely or become mere stagnant pools. The largest ar 
Victoria, Tchad, Nyassa, Tanganyika. Victoria is said to b 
the largest fresh-water lake on the globe. 
6. Rivers. Africa has some large rivers, but because o: 
their cataracts and lack of harbors they are commercially un- 
important. The largest and most important river is the Nile] 
It annually overflows its banks, bringing down rich soil from 
the mountains, making the most fertile valley in the world, 
which is called the “Gift of the Nile.” A peculiar feature 
of this river. is that it diminishes in size as it approaches the 
sea. This is owing to the large amount of water that is used 
for irrigation and that is lost by evaporation, and also to the 
fact that in all the last part of its course it receives no tributary. 
The Congo or Livingstone is another important river in 
Africa. In its basin has been established the Congo Free 
State. It was formed by representatives of several European 
states. The king of Belgium is the president of the corpora- 
tion. Stanley is the governor of the state. The other rivers 
are Niger, Zambesi, Orange. 
7. Soil. The parts along the shores, except along the coast 
of Sahara, are very fertile. The interior is but little known, 
but so far as known it consists of extensive barren regions, 
alternating with fertile valleys. 
8. Climate. Owing to its position in the Torrid Zone and 
to the large number of sandy deserts, the heat is unbearable. 
In the Sahara the temperature is often 150 degrees above 
zero in the daytime, while at night it grows so cold that the 
water freezes. Throughout a large part of Africa there are
-P-A-G-E-163
TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY 167 
only two seasons. For six months it rains and for six months 
itis dry. 
g. Productions. a. Agricultural, There are large forests 
of baobab, teak, mangrove, ebony and India-rubber. The 
north-western portions of Africa produce acacia, myrrh, cinna- 
mon, and other spices, besides cotton, coffee, and sugar-cane. 
The date-palm flourishes along the borders of the Great 
Desert. Some of the baobab trees are thirty feet in diameter, 
while their branches are larger than most of the trees with 
which we are familiar in America, 
b. Mineral, Gold is abundant along the Guinea coast. 
There are important diamond-fields in Grigua Land, along 
the Orange river, Salt, iron and saltpetre are also abundant- 
ly found. . 
c. Manufactured, In tanning and dyeing leather the peo- 
of Morocco are very skillful. Leather and oils are the only 
important manufactures. 
zo, Commerce. The exports are gold, ivory, Morocca 
leather, dates, palm-oil and ostrich feathers. 
x1, Improvements. Africa cannot much longer be called 
the Dark Continent, if railways continue to be built, In 
Egypt, Algiers and Cape Colony there are several thousand 
miles of railway. The Suez Canal connects the Red and 
Mediterranean seas. It is one hundred miles long and has 
a depth of twenty-four feet and a width of seventy-five feet at 
the bottom. It was built by the French, but is now under the 
control of the English. 
iz, Animals. Africa is noted for its large and ferocious 
animals. The giraffe, hippopotamus, chimpanzee, zebra, 
quagga, and gnu are all natives of Africa. Here also we find 
the elephant, rhinoceros, hyena, ostrich, ibis, flamingo, par- 
rots, ciocodiles, enormous serpents and millions of insects. 
The tsetse is a small fly, whose bite is certain death to a 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
168 - TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY, 
horse, dog or ox. The termites or white ants build conical- 
shaped hills, sometimes twenty feet in height, in groups or 
villages. Each house is divided into chambers or galleries. 
The natives of Africa use them, for food. 
_ 13. Inhabitants. Moors live in the Barbary states; Arabs 
in the Great Desert; Negroes in the rest of Africa. Among 
the natives we find the greatest ignorance and vice. 
15. Political Divisions. The independent states of Africa 
are Morocco, Abyssinia, Zanzibar, Orange Free State, Liberia, 
Congo Free State, and the South African Republic. Liberia was 
founded as a colony for freed slaves from the United States. 
Its capital is Monrovia, named after President Monroe. The 
British Possessions are Cape Colony, Natal, Sierra Leone, the 
Goid Coast or part of Upper Guinea, the Niger Delta, and a 
few other places. Zululand and Caffraria are subject to Great 
Britain, but ruled by native chiefs. Egypt is nominally sub- 
ject to Turkey, but practically subject to Great Britain. The 
French Possessions are Algeria, Tunis, Senegambia, part of 
Soudan, To Portugal belong the Madeira, Azores, and Cape 
Verde Islands, also a strip along the western and eastern 
coasts in Lower Guinea and Mozambique. 
16. Cities. Cairo is the capital of Egypt and the largest 
city in Africa. Alexandria was named after Alexander the 
Great. It is the oldest city in Africa and contains interesting 
remains, as Pompey’s Pillar. At one time it contained the 
largest library in the world and had a population of 650,000. 
Tananarivo is the capital of Madagascar and a large manufac- 
turing city. Khartoom is the center of a large caravan trade: 
Zanzibar, on an island of the same name, is the chief market 
in the world for ivory. Other cities are Tunis, Tripoli, 
Morocco, Algiers, Fez, Cape Town, Suez, Port Said. 
17. Language and Object Lessons, ‘Three thousand years 
ago nearly all the learning of the world was contained in

Egypt, from thence it spread to other parts of the world. 
Compare its condition then with its condition now. Describe 
the “Ship of the Desert,” the mirage, the sand-storms, the 
cause of the desert, the Sphinx, the pyramids, the search for 
the source of the Nile, grain-sowing in the valley of the 
Nile, the Suez Canal, the productions, the animals, includ- 
ing the white ants and tsetse ; the customs of the inhabitants, 
including their superstitions and human sacrifices; the life 
and labors of Livingstone, Gordon and Stanley. Contrast 
Nubia, formerly Ethiopia, the seat of powerful and popu- 
lous nations, with Nubia of to-day, only inhabited by bar- 
barous tribes. It seldom rains in Egypt; why is the valley 
so fertile? Where are the rough diamonds from Africa sent? 
Why has England so much to do with Egyptian affairs? 
XXIX. — Oceania. 
1. Position, Oceania includes Australia and most of the 
islands of the Pacific. 
2. Divisions. Oceania is divided into three divisions. 
1, Malaysia, which includes the Sunda islands, viz.: Sumatra, 
Borneo, Java; Philippine, Celebes and Moluccas or Spice 
Isiands, 2. Australasia, which includes the continent of Aus- 
tralia and also Melanesia. Melanesia includes Papua, New 
Britain, Solomon, New Hebrides, Santa Cruz, New Caledonia, 
Loyalty, New Zealand, Tasmania and many small islands, 
3. Polynesia, meaning many islands, which includes all the 
rest of Oceania. The important islands of this group are 
the Sandwich or Hawaiian Kingdom, Feejee, Caroline, La- 
drone, and Samoa or Navigator islands. 
3. Coast. a. Oceans. Pacific, Indian. 
b. Seas. South China, Java, Arafura, New Zealand. 
ec. Gulf. Carpentaria. 
a. Straits. Malacca, Macassar, Sunda, Torres, Bass.
-P-A-G-E-166
176 TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 
4. Surface. Australia resembles Africa in surface, i.e., it 
has mountains along the coast and plains in the interior. 
Tasmania, New Zealand, and the Sunda islands have a moun- 
tainous surface. Most-of the islands of the Pacific are vol- 
canic, many of them containing active volcanoes; others are 
of coral formation. 
a. Peaks. Tomboro in the island of Sumbawa is a large 
active volcano. During some of its eruptions, houses forty 
miles distant have been crushed by the weight of ashes, 
Mauna Loa and Kilauea in Hawaii are large volcanoes, 
During eruptions the lava from these mountains flows fifty 
miles to the sea, so that the ocean is heated for miles around, 
killing fish by the millions. In 1886, a chain of volcanoes in 
New Zealand suddenly became active, burying whole villages 
with all their inhabitants. : 
b. Natural Curiosities. See Grade 1V. These islands are 
so covered with curious and interesting things that it would 
fill a volume to describe them. You should read about them. 
5. Rivers. The rivers of the islands are unimportant. The 
Murray and Darling are the largest rivers of Australia. 
.6. Soil., In most of the islands the soil is very fertile, 
The interior of Australia is barren, but the south-eastern part 
is productive. 
7. Climate. The East Indies are visited by terrible ty- 
phoons, and along the shores of many islands it is unhealthy 
to live, but it is delightful in the interior. The lack of rain in 
parts of Australia has a great influence upon the climate, 
causing sudden and great changes in the temperature. _ The 
climate, however, is healthful. 
8. Productions. a. Agricultural, The East Indies proe 
duce coffee, tropical fruits, all kinds of spices, and sweet. 
scented sandal-wood, There are found in Australia several 
thousand varieties of trees and plants not found elsewhere.
-P-A-G-E-167
TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 17t 
Ferns grow to the size of trees. All grains and fruits have 
been introduced and are flourishing. None were found there 
when Australia was discovered. 
b. Mineral. Australia is rich in gold, silver, copper, iron 
and tin. In Borneo are found diamonds; in Sumatra, gold, 
sulphur, petroleum ; in Tasmania, gold, precious stones and 
coral; in Feejee, mother of pearl. 
9g. Commerce. Coffee and spices are the chief exports of 
the islands ; gold and wool of Australia. 
zo. Animals. Few of the animals common in other coun- 
tries are found here, and few of those found here are common 
elsewhere. The kangaroo, ornithorynchus and emu are the 
principal animals, : 
1x, Government. The government of Australia is similar 
to that of Canada. Most of the islands are subject to foreign 
powers. In 1885, the Australasian Federation was founded. 
This includes Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, West 
Australia, and Tasmania. New South Wales and New Zealand 
are free to enter the Federation at any time. We have then a 
new nation, whose area is nearly as large as that of the United 
States, 
12. Foreign Possessions. England owns Australia, New 
Zealand, Tasmania, Feejee and a part of Borneo and New 
Guinea. Borneo is about the size of Texas and therefore one 
of the largest islands in the world. Holland owns Java, 
Celebes, Spice islands, and the greater part of Papua, Sumatra 
and Borneo. Java is densely populated, and called the “ Land 
of Fire,” on account of its numerous volcanoes, lakes of fire, 
and “valleys of death.” Spain owns the Philippine, Caroline 
and other islands. France owns New Caledonia, Marquesas, 
Society and other islands. Germany owns the Bismarck Archi- 
pelago, and a part of New Guinea. The Sandwich islands 
are independent.

13. Cities. Melbourne is the commercial city of Australia, 
and Sydney is the oldest city. Batavia, the capital of Java, 
is an important commercial city. Manilla, the capital of the 
Philippine islands, exports manilla hemp, used in making rope. 
Honolulu is the chief city of the Sandwich Islands. 
14. Language and Object Lessons. Give language lessons 
upon the customs of the inhabitants, the wonders of nature 
and the peculiar animals. Give object lessons on coral; its 
manner of forming islands; on cinnamon, cloves, pepper, 
nutmegs, mace, eucalyptus or gum-tree, kangaroo and ornith- 
orynchus. 
GRADE VIII. 
GEOGRAPHY REVIEWED. 
This review should be more than a rehearsal of knowledge 
already acquired. The facts already learned should be 
classified and compared, new facts should be taught and new 
points made clear. As a preparation for this work every 
teacher should study such books as Redway’s Manual of 
Geography, Jackson’s Astronomical Geography, Frye’s Child 
and Nature, King’s Methods and Aids in Geography, Crock- 
er’s Methods of Teaching Geography, Carver’s How to Teach 
Geography. 
1. Taking the earth as the standard, teach the relative 
position and size of the other planets of the solar system. 
Have the pupils observe the apparent motions of the sun, 
moon and stars, and report upon them. In this connection 
many geometrical terms must be illustrated and made clear, 
such as: a point, a line, a surface, a plane, a circle, a circum- 
ference, a radius, a diameter, a solid, a sphere; also astro- 
nomical terms, such as zenith, nadir, celestial hemisphere, 
equinox, solstice, declination, ecliptic,
-P-A-G-E-169
TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 173 
2. Teach the position of the pole-star in reference to 
observers at different points, as, on the equator, on the tropic 
of Cancer, in the home city, at the north pole. 
3. Seasons, Day and Night. Use a circular table in the 
middie of which mark the sun, The flat table represents the * 
plane of the earth’s orbit. Place the earth at the position of 
the first equinox, when day and night are equal all over the 
globe and the sun above the equator. Show that the climate 
of nearly all the United States would be neither hot nor cold 
and that the time is March 21, known as the Spring Equinox, 
Move the earth one-fourth around the table; the time is the 
21st of June. The sun has now moved to its most northern 
point and appears to stand still. This is called the Solstice 
or Solar Stand. Show how the climate has been growing 
gradually warmer until it is summer. Now move the earth to 
the position of the Autumn Equinox and then to the Winter 
Solstice, showing clearly how our changes in climate are 
produced. At the same time show the equal length of the 
day and night at the time of the Spring Equinox, the long 
days of the Summer Solstice, again the equal length of the 
day and night of the Autumn Equinox, and the short days of 
the Winter Solstice. Show what is the effect at the same 
time in other portions of the globe outside of the United 
States, such as in the Arctic regions or in the Southern 
Hemisphere. Lead the pupils to notice when the sun rises 
north of a point directly east of them and sets south of a 
point directly west. Call attention also to the reverse. Do 
not fail to illustrate the greater heat from rays falling verti- 
cally than obliquely. In this connection also teach why it is 
colder on a high mountain, though it may be under a vertical 
sun, ‘The children should also be taught that the rays of light 
are not themselves visible, and from it show the cause of twi- 
light and the reason why the sun’s rays cannot be seen at 
night, although going past the earth.
-P-A-G-E-170
174 TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY. 
4. Moon’s Phases. Illustrate by means of a lamp and two 
globes, one larger than the other, the phases of the moon and 
the cause of eclipses. 
5. Zones. Show how they are caused by the inclination of 
the earth’s axis. Show that if the earth’s axis was vertical to 
the rays from the sun, (1), day and night would be equal all 
over the earth; (2), there would be no change of seasons. 
6. Longitude and Time. Show the relations of one to the 
other and give practice in determining the difference in time 
when the difference in longitude is known or the reverse. 
Clearly explain also the Standard Time Sections. Have the 
pupils compare the latitude and longitude of the important 
cities with the home city. When they observe that the lati- 
tude of two cities is nearly the same, but the climate different, 
train them to discover the cause or causes. Show them why 
the length of the degrees of latitude are always the same, 
while the length of the degrees of longitude varies. 
7. Winds and Waves. Show the cause of tides and 
explain why some places have higher tides than others. 
Study the cause of winds and ocean currents. Show why they 
blow or flow in certain directions rather than in others. Lo- 
cate and discover the cause of the “zone of calms.” Let the 
class determine what winds and currents would be favorable 
for certain voyages to be taken in imagination. Show the use 
of the winds and currents in helping trade and commerce and 
in modifying the climate of different regions of the earth’s 
surface. Show the cause and result of “land and sea breezes,” 
Show also how high mountains and the configuration of the 
coast produce local currents of air and water. 
8. Climate. Show how the climate is effected by latitude, by 
elevation of the land, by the slope of the land, by the near- 
ness to the sea, by the prevailing winds, by the ocean-currents. 
Train the pupils to determine for themselves what the
-P-A-G-E-171
TOPICS IN GEOGRAPHY, 175 
climate of any grand division must be by studying the things . 
that effect it. 
g. Life. Show how the plant life and animal life of any 
place depends largely upon climate. Teach that the most 
important life upon the earth is that of the human family. 
Show how the human family is divided into four races, — 
the Aryan, the Semitic, the Turanic, the Hamitic or Negro; 
these races into divisions and the divisions into sub-divisions. 
Show the location of the different divisions and the causes 
that have differently effected their development. 
19. Occupation. Study the different occupations and de- 
termine what natural advantages confine them to the different 
localities. 
11. Religion and Government. Study the form of religion 
and government of the different nations, for much of a 
nation’s progress in civilization depends upon them. 
1z, Commerce. Take the important commercial centers of 
the different countries and find out what articles are exported 
from each as well as what are imported into each. Determine 
the means of transportation from each one of these centers. 
Compare the mode of transportation in the United States and 
Europe with that found in Asia and Africa. 
13. Outline Maps. Throughout these Topics you will 
notice that much stress is put upon progressive map-drawing. 
Map-drawing for the sole purpose of drawing a map is a 
waste of time. Maps should be drawn only for the purpose 
of firmly fixing some important point. Do not spend more 
time in teaching complicated construction lines, than is 
required to teach the entire subject of any grand division. 
Progressive outline maps can now be secured at a small cost, 
which any ingenious teacher can use in many different ways. 
The best maps of this kind which we have seen are published 
by D. C. Heath & Co., of Boston. Use such maps for pro-

gressive work, for memory work, for showing relief by suitable 
coloring, etc. 
14. Books of Reference. A very full list of all books per- 
taining to the literature of geography can be found in King’s 
“Methods and Aids in Geography.” The following list has 
been taken, by permission of Prof. Redway, from his “Man. 
ual of Geography,” published by D. C. Heath & Co,

COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES. 
Tue following chapter on the commerce of the United States is| 
not intended to be an exhaustive treatise on that subject ; for that 
purpose see Tilden’s Commercial Geography and King’s Methods 
and Aids in Geography. Neither are the items given as so many 
facts for the pupils to learn, The teacher should rather take each 
article of export, one at a time, and have the pupils prepare 
papers ; telling in what part of our country each article is pro- 
duced, from what port it would be shipped, by what commercial 
route carried, to what countries and ports taken, what the return- 
ing cargo would be. 
ComMERCE. 
Commerce means the exchange of merchandise between different 
places. It is of two kinds, domestic and foreign. By domestic 
commerce we mean the trade carried on between the different 
parts of our own country. By foreign commerce we mean the 
trade carried on between the United States and any foreign 
country. 
Domestic COMMERCE. . 
No nation in the world can compare with the United States in 
its facilities for domestic commerce. “It is carried on by means of 
navigable rivers, canals, railways, and coasting-vessels. 
Rivers. 
The following rivers are of great commercial importance: 
East, Hudson, Mississippi, Delaware, Ohio, etc. 
CANALS. 1 
The following artificial water-routes are of great aid in carrying 
on commerce; the Erie canal, connecting Lake Erie and the
-P-A-G-E-181
COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES. 185, 
Hudson river; the Ohio, the Miami, the Wabash and Erie, all 
three connecting Lake Erie with the Ohio river; the Welland, 
connecting Lake Erie and Lake Ontario; the one connecting 
Lake Superior with Lake Huron ; the numerous canals in Pennsyl- 
vania and Maryland. . 
RAILWAYS. 
The cost of the railways in the United States is estimated 
at $9,000,000,000 and the length at 150,000 miles. There are 
several trunk lines connecting the cities on the Atlantic coast with 
those in the Mississippi valley. These are : The Grand Trunk, The 
Boston & Albany, The New York Central, The Pennsylvania, 
The Baltimore & Ohio, The Norfolk & Western, The Central 
Georgia. The cities in the Mississippi valley are connected with all 
points South and West by The Northern Pacific, The Union Pacific, 
The Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fé, The Chicago, Burlington, 
& Quincy, The Southern Pacific, etc. The Panama R.R. is of 
commercial importance to us, although not in our territory. 
COMMERCIAL Propucrs. 
1, Agricultural : 
Cotton. Nearly four-fifths of all the cotton raised is produced 
inthe United States. Our cotton is of superior quality, particularly 
the famous sea-island cotton which grows on the islands along 
the coast. Cotton is produced in large quantities in Georgia, Ala- 
bama, Texas, Mississippi, and all the Southern States, 
Wheat. The United States produces more wheat than any other 
country. Produced in North and South Dakota, Indiana, Hlinois, 
Minnesota and the West Central States.

GEOGRAPHICAL READING 195 
GEOGRAPHICAL READING. 
Wirn the multitude of books of travel that are poured out 
upon the public from a score of publishing houses, there should 
be no dearth of reading. Books of sterling value, however, are 
not numerous; and many very popular books, while they are 
fascinating because of their vivid word painting, are worthless so 
far as geographical merit is concerned. The following list might 
easily be expanded many times its present length, but it is doubt- 
ful if its value would be materially increased.

of the states and territories. The latter embraces the states of 
the United States only, and contains very valuable statistical 
matter.

    There are but few good wall maps published. Those whic| 
ate respectable in geographical features are generally wanting i 
pedagogical qualities, and many of those which have been coi 
piled for their pedagogical value are thoroughly disreputable i 
every other respect. The following are among the better class :

When ordered by mail at the hundred rate, the postage, which on 
full hundreds is 25 cents for the small maps and 50 cents for the large, 
must be paid by the purchaser. 
Some of the advantages of the use of the Progressive Outline Maps are the 
following :— 
All the practical benefits of map-drawing are secured. By 
Economy of tracing the dim outline, and then developing a continent 
Time. along such special lines as the teacher may direct, every im- 
portant feature is clearly fixed in the mind of the pupil. 
They keep a correct form of the country under considera- 
tion constantly before the pupil. 
(a) These maps may be used to indicate, besides the 
General usual geographical facts, the location of areas of mineral de- 
Usefulness. posits, of forest growth, of prairies, deserts, plateaus, of the 
various kinds of soil, of staple productions, of dense popula- 
tion, of manufacturing districts, etc. 
(4) For developing Physical Geography, these maps are very valuable, 
(¢) In the study of History, these maps may be used to great advantage in 
ways that will be plainly understood by every teacher. 
No time can be spared in History for practice in map-deawing. 
(2) For rapid and thorough tests of pupil’s knowledge of Political, De- 
scriptive, and Physical Geography, and of many facts in History, no series of 
questions and answers can equal in three hours what may be ascertained, prac- 
tically, of their knowledge of these subjects by the Outlines in thirty minutes. 
Such a map can be easily and rapidly inspected by the examiner. 
These maps cost the pupil two cents each. Several times 
that amount is usually expended for paper required for the 
practice in producing a satisfactory map by other methods,

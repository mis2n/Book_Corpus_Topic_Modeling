PREFACE 
Tuts book is designed for the experienced teacher 
and for teachers in training. It presents an analysis of 
the nature of geography as a science, and of the peda- 
gogical principles involved. Upon this is based the 
discussion of the special method of the teaching of 
geography. The treatment is rendered concrete by 
examples from classroom experience. 
While a general review of the subject matter of geog- 
raphy is out of the question in a book of this kind, 
there is considerable that will serve to review and im- 
press at least the general principles of the science. 
The book begins with the subject and method of 
home geography, and then proceeds with the discussion 
of the work of the higher grades, in such a way as to 
indicate the growth of the subject in the pupil’s mind. 
This plan lends itself well to a logical development of 
the theory and method of teaching and to the organi- 
zation of the science of geography.

PRINCIPLES AND METHODS 
OF TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
CHAPTER I 
THE AIMS OF GEOGRAPHY 
The grand distinction between Man and other creatures is 
that he can take advantage of his environment, so as to modify 
his development in any desired direction. — Mit. 
Practical value. — Geography has a place in the cur-. 
riculum on account of its practical utility and cultural 
value. Its usefulness is apparent from the mere state- 
ment of the definition of geography as the description of 
the habitat of man, and of his physical and psychical 
adjustment to his environment. 
Geography teaches place relations} This knowledge 
is applied in daily life in finding one’s way about the 
home community, in reading and conversation, in send- 
ing letters or parcels, and in business. 
The commercial world depends upon geographical 
information.) The importer must know where his wares 
may be obtained, and by what routes they may be 
shipped most cheaply. The fruit conimission man, for 
example, must be in touch with California, Florida,

     Cuba, and Spain. From all these regions he can gj 
oranges. He must know in what season in each count 
the fruit is ripe. Even to the fruiterer at the corn 
and to the housewife who buys the fruit, such geograp 
ical knowledge would not come amiss. 
The manufacturer must know the source of his ray 
materials, the markets for his products, and the rou’ é 
of shipment. The exporter, likewise, must be famili 
with routes and markets, else he might be “carryi 
coals to Newcastle.” Knowledge of transporta 
facilities is immensely important in modern commercia 
life. The shortest and most economical routes must 
chosen to meet competition. 
Geography teaches us about our own country 
natural advantages, resources, and beauty ; its gree 
ness and possibilities, and also its limitations, w! 
enables us individually or as a nation to make be 
adjustments to our physical environment. The stu 
of foreign regions is but a complement of home g 
raphy. As citizens of the United States we should 
acquainted with the geographical conditions of ti 
countries with which we have commercial dealings 
‘historical and political association. Many useful les 
for home application may be learned from the stuc 
foreign countries. 5

on the West for its Cans how the West in turn 
s most of its manufactured articles from the East; 
iow the cities and the rural sections balance each other ; 
short, it teaches us “‘how the other half lives.” In 
is way it tends to develop in the student a social to 
pathy, a feeling of relationship to others, a certain 
se of civic duty that help toward good citizenship. 
he development_of _patriotism_and_good_ citizenship 
should be a chief aim in’ the teaching of geography. : 
reover, a knowledge of world geography should\ ‘™ 
“broaden our ‘international sympathies and make for 
- universal peace. Countries that do not know each other 
e suspicious of each other. On the other hand, a   
  
owledge of geography encourages international travel, 
merée, confidence, and intérdependence. 
Geography helps us in understanding and appre- 
ting the frequent geographical allusions in “our daily 
rrent events are meaningless in proportion as we are 
orant of the places where they occur, ot of the geo- 
gr aphical conditions affecting them. iaisty depends ab- 
olutely upon geography to give it definiteness. When

in the pursuit of further geographical studies, or in 
occasional need of interpreting these data in general 
reading, _ 
Cultural aims. (Taming to those aims of ote 
that consider something beyond mere utility, namely, 
intellectual pleasure, mental strength, refinement, and 
growth of "character, the subject, it will be found, has 
much to offer.) It should be noted that some of the pre- 
ceding utilitarian aims have also a cultural side, as the 
development of the social sense and patriotism, and the 
appreciation of history and literature. 
Geography contributes to the enjoyment—ofthe 
natural elements and forces, the beauty of scenery, 
and the ways of life of the people, both in our local 
walks and in more extended travels. One should read 
the geography of the places to be visited, their history 
and literature, if one wishes to get the most pleasure and 
satisfaction out of travel. 
The subject of geography is intrinsically very interest- 
—ing- Books of travel, exploration, and of descriptive, 
general geography may be very pleasant and entertain- 
ing reading. In fact, in the beginning when geography 
had not yet been accredited as a distinct subject for 
schools, and efforts were made to introduce it, this was 
one of the chief arguments of its advocates. Sir Thomas 
Elyot, in the Governour, 1531, writing about cosmography 
(what geography was then), says:
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE AIMS OF GEOGRAPHY 5 
“For what pleasure it is, in one hour to behold those realms, 
cities, seas, rivers, and mountains that uneth [scarcely] in an old 
man’s life can not be journeyed and pursued! What incredible 
delight is taken in beholding the diversities of people, beasts, 
fowls, fishes, trees, fruits, and herbs: to know the sundry manners 
and conditions of people, and the variety of their natures, and that 
in a warm study or parlour, without peril of the sea, a danger of 
long and painfuljourneys. Icannot tell what more pleasure should 
happen to a gentle wit than to behold in his own house every thing 
that within all the world is contained.” — Watson. 
Geography as a discipline tends to establish certain _ 
habits of f thinking, a geographical method of looking at 
the relations of the earth and man. There is a great 
mass of facts for concrete reasoning, and much oppor- 
tunity for working out the abstract relations that exist 
between these facts. The logic of the causal relation, 
the method of comparison, the grouping of geographical 
facts, the generalization of principles, are some of the 
forms of reasoning required in geography. These habits 
of thought should be valuable not only in the study of 
geography itself, but in history, and in the geographical 
experiences of daily life. 
Geography is no longer something to tax the memory 
merely. eee thought content is as great as in any other 
a Gffording the best of the best of opportunity fc for inspiring 
the imagination and cultivating clear. logical thinking.)

CHAPTER II 
CHILDREN’S INTERESTS IN GEOGRAPHY 
Arrangement of subject matter. — Textbooks of geog- 
raphy fall into two general classes. (The first may be 
called scientific or logical, the other psychological or 
In the former the facts of the science are 
  arranged according to their natural, logical sequence, in 
modern days chiefly along ‘evolutionary or causal lines, 
beginning with the astronomical and ending with the 
human side. The other class of texts recognize that the 
scientific order is unintelligible and uninteresting to the 
beginner, and that since the child’s mind is quite dif- 
ferent in its range from the adult’s, the subject must be 
adapted to it in scope, arrangement, and method of ’pres- 
entation. The growth of this principle was slow and 
is not fully in force to-day. 
Adaptation of texts. — The earlier textbooks were 
lacking in any attempt to come down to the level of * 
the child, the only difference being that a beginner’s 
text must be smaller than the adult’s. So textbooks were 
made for children by abridging those intended for 
maturer students. Such abridgment, however, is not 
satisfactory. \

  CHILDREN’S INTERESTS IN GEOGRAPHY 7 
Since about a century ago, when the teaching process 
itself was first subjected to study, much has been learned 
as tomethods of instruction. The greatest thing brought 
out by this study is that instruction must be adapted to 
the mental capacity and interests of the learner. 
Mental stages. — It is agreed among psychologists 
and educators that children pass through several periods 
or stages of mental growth, and that the studies and 
methods of instruction for one stage are not necessarily 
suited to another. 
So far as teaching geography is concerned, while it 
must be remembered that they overlap and shade into 
each other, these stages are as follows: 
The observational or perceptive stage. — At this period 
the child learns through his physical senses and thinks 
objectively and concretely. This is also the stage of 
learning the names of things. The reflective or reason- 
ing ability is not yet marked. 
The memorizing and imaginative stage. — The child is 
now able to go beyond the range of direct experience. 
His memory is retentive, perhaps more than at any other 
period; and his imagination is active. He can take the 
facts in his memory and recombine them into new rela- 
tions through the imagination. He is not so dependent 
upon observation for his knowledge, and pictures and 
books become intelligible to him, because he has ac- 
quired the necessary sense experience in the first stage.
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
The reflective stage. —In this the reasoning ability is 
more mature, and the tendency to reflect on facts and 
to seek their relations is stronger. At this stage the 
children want to know the “ Why ” of things, and the 
abstract is of greater interest. 
The teaching of geography must follow this order 
of the child’s development. Upon it, if the teaching is to 
be economical and efficient, both the subject matter and 
the method of instruction must be based. The great 
fault with the older books, and with much recent instruc- 
tion, is that they force little children to think in the way 
of adults. We have given to little beginners textbooks 
on the technical, logical plan. The consequence is that 
the child does not appreciate the subject; it is unintel- 
ligible and dull. In this respect geography is “one of 
the worst taught subjects in school.” (Gibb.) Dr. G. 
Stanley Hall calls it ‘‘ the sick man of the curriculum.” 
* As an example of a science which might be full of life, 
and which may be taught as a string of the baldest and 
crudest and dullest facts imaginable, geography is 
preéminent.”’ (O. Lodge.) 
Children’s interests in geography.—It is a current 
maxim in education that in order to secure the co- 
operation of the pupil, and to teach along the line of 
least resistance, and at the same time most efficiently, 
it is necessary first to secure his interest. Real effort in 
study is proportionate to interest. Secondary interests,
-P-A-G-E-21
  CHILDREN’S INTERESTS IN GEOGRAPHY 9 
such as reward and punishment, are not meant here, 
but rather a liking for the subject itself. 
Several profitable studies have been made by W. S. 
Monroe, Anna Buckbee, “Sarah Young, C. Brodeur, 
David Gibb, and others to discover the geographical 
interests of school children. ‘If you could travel, 
where would you like to go, and why would you like to 
go there?” or an equivalent question has been put to 
thousands of children. The children ranged through all 
school grades of geography. Monroe found that out of 
4000 children in Massachusetts, the greatest number 
preferred to visit cities, especially those near by and 
frequently mentioned. Of these 355 wanted to visit 
New York City; the second largest number, 72, Boston. 
The older children preferred foreign cities, Paris, Rome, 
London. The next strongest interest, again chiefly 
among the older pupils, was in states and countries. 
California, Florida, Canada, England, China, and Japan 
were the favorites. The reasons assigned for desir- 
ing to visit these places were: to see friends or rela- 
tives, to visit a birthplace, some national or historic 
interest, an agreeable climate, the fruit, and in some 
cases art and religion. Of the 4000 only 200 wanted 
to see physical features, such as the ocean, moun- 
tains, etc. 
David Gibb made similar studies, in 1907, and found 
the interests for different grades were as follows: 
aa
-P-A-G-E-22
“a 10 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Grade IV — People, land and water forms, animals, 
buildings, China, Japan, Holland, ships, relatives. 
Grade V — People, water, animals, cities, buildings, 
land, products, Japan, maps, plants, occupations, 
manufacturing. 
Grade VI — People, buildings, occupations, water, 
land, scenery, animals, products, manufacturing, climate, 
maps, ships. 
, Grade VII — People, land, cities, occupations, ani- 
/mals, products, water, art, buildings, history, plants. 
{ Grade VIII— People, water, animals, cities, land, build- 
\ings, plants, occupations, products, manufacturing, art. 
From these studies we may get some idea of what 
children think about in geography. These data, how- 
ever, are not absolute. ) It is evident that.interests vary 
with locality, antl current events,.with other 
subjects’in the curriculum, and with the treatment of 
geography in any particular school. There is no question 
that people and their ways appeal most in geography ; 
and that to beginners, the life of children in other lands 
is especially attractive. Jane Andrews’ Seven Little 
Sisters will long remain a children’s classic. 
Application of the principle of interest in teaching. — 
Geography throughout the elementary school must have 
——a human center> To throw the emphasis where it belongs 
in the elementary school, it should be defined as A De- 
scription of how Man lives upon the Earth. 
>
-P-A-G-E-23
  CHILDREN’S INTERESTS IN GEOGRAPHY oe 
Beginners in_geography_should_study~aboutpéople, their cystoms, houses, clothing, sports, family life, and 
about land and water features of the vicinity which they 
can study observationally. a 
The commercial sense comes later (fifth, sixth, seventh 
grades), and then occupations, manufacturing, products, 
processes, should be studied. In these grades maps 
appeal. And since memorizing is easy, the great bulk of 
places and facts necessary for conventional and practi- 
cal use in later life should be drilled on here. The im- 
agination should be fed with descriptive geography rich 
in interest. 
In the last years of the course the causal | relation, /|\ 
historic associations, and the commercial principles of Ne 
a geography are of greater interest. The facts previously 
learned may here be analyzed and generalized. Physical 
geography can be used more fully as the basis for the 
political.’ The heroic side of geography — discovery 
and exploration — should be touched upon, and the biog- 
raphies of great explorers read. The more complex 
relations of human life, as shown in art, religion, society, 
and government, are now more interesting and better 
understood. 
As the pupils mature and feel themselves a part of 
society the social motive may be appealed to. This has 
more of a moral force. It is a sort of educational con- 
‘science, which makes the pupil realize he owes it to
-P-A-G-E-24
  
  12 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
himself and society to learn those things that will give 
him a proper standing with his associates, and will 
enable him to do his share of society’s work. In this 
respect geography is eminently valuable. W. T. Harris 
placed geography next to history in social importance. 
By following the natural interest_of the child, the 
study is more than mere task work. It is the psycho- 
logical course. Any other method will make the subject 
unintelligible, therefore uninteresting and dull to the 
pupil. Interest lacking, the pupil resorts to the method 
of learning by rote even what he does not understand. 
Keep alive the glow of curiosity. When ennui takes 
the place of lively curiosity, geography becomes drudgery. 
The wonder motive should prevail throughout the whole 
course. 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
CHAPTER III 
THE OBSERVATIONAL AND ORAL METHOD 
OF INSTRUCTION 
Real basis of geography. — Geography is so generally 
associated with a textbook that it is easy to overlook 
the fact that the foundation for the subject is not a 
book at all, but the real physical featuresand forces   
of the earth, the plants and animals and_living people. 
It is these that a beginner should study, and these 
realities should be used throughout the course as a check 
on the books. Geography should be studied objectively, 
concretely, as far as possible. 
Their natural curiosity prompts the children to note 
and examine the multifarious aspects of human life, 
occupations, industrial processes, natural phenomena, 
earth and water features, and scenery, to formulate some 
sort of definition of thésé things, and to create in their 
minds something that corresponds to a map of the 
home locality. These definite, concrete concepts must 
necessarily be the basis for studying the geography of 
inaccessible regions, which has to be learned through hear- 
say, especially from books. The only conception a child 
can form of a mountain, if he has never seen one, must 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
    
14 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
be through the imagination, aided by pictures, and com- 
parison with such elevations as he may have actually seen. 
Concrete teaching. — This self-instruction through 
observation should constitute the method of Home 
Geography (Chapter V). The pedagogical value of 
this method is universally admitted, though by no 
means universally practiced, and is generally dropped 
after the first steps in geography have been taken. 
In every grade, throughout life, interest in the real world 
should be maintained by reference to the actual geogra- 
phy of daily experience. 
The child comes to geography with a fairly large mass 
of facts gained thus from actual experience in his home 
locality in the years before school begins. This ap- 
perceptive basis is further increased by the nature- 
study of the first years of school. In learning these 
things books were not used. The method of instruction 
hitherto employed should be continued when geography 
is begun. 
First instruction oral. — At the beginning, instruction 
in geography should be oral. This lends itself best to 
the observational method of learning. It possesses the 
advantage of the personal quality given it by the teacher. 
It is a more flexible method than the textbook, and per- 
mits of variations and quick adaptations to the exigencies 
of the recitation. A teacher who has thoroughly 
prepared herself and is gifted with a fair imagination
-P-A-G-E-27
OBSERVATIONAL METHOD OF INSTRUCTION 15 
can usually make a topic more vivid and impressive 
than the impersonal, impassive textbook. 
Unfortunately, we give pupils, even in home geog- 
raphy, a text, and then the vicious effects of cramming 
are soon realized.. In some countries, Germany for 
example, pupils do not have such large, finely illus- 
trated textbooks. They may have a mere epitome, or 
_ probably none. The teacher presents the ‘subject 
orally, elaborating, illustrating, explaining, and enriching 
by correlation with history, art, and science. 
Children like the personal element in geography. 
A teacher should draw upon her travel experiences 
to make her teaching vivid and interesting. Short, 
simple word pictures of famous places or scenery, or 
sketches of human life in different countries, if based 
upon personal experience, are always entertaining 
to children. Likewise, pupils should be encouraged to 
tell what they have seen on their journeys. By so doing, 
the air of unreality possessed by the world in the book 
will, at least for the moment, disappear. 
There is danger, however, that too much work on the 
part of the teacher will leave the pupils mentally passive. 
To prevent this they should be taught to think actively, 
to think geographically. They should use their own 
observations and knowledge to make inferences and 
judgments. They should be given little geographical 
problems to work out. 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
16 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Eliciting. — To this end the usual method of eliciting 
can be admirably employed. Through appropriate, 
thought-encouraging questions~pupils can be led to 
observe the natural environment, specimens, experi- 
ments, pictures, maps, etc.,and to form their own opin- 
ions as to the geographical relations shown. In a field 
lesson on a Stream, the teacher can thus get the pupils 
to see for themselves that water runs according to the 
slope, fast or slow; that it gathers in its course sediment, 
which it drops again at certain places. The relation 
between the motion of the water and the occurrence of 
deposit may thus be worked out. The subject of Rain 
may be developed, without telling very much, by per- 
forming suitable experiments in evaporation and conden- 
sation. Or, by eliciting, alone, pupils may from a 
physical map determine conditions of topography, 
climate, drainage, and other features. It is, in gen- 
eral, better to let the pupil thus see or find out facts 
for himself, than for the teacher to do all the talk- 
ing on the subject. If properly conducted, this 
method gives the pupil initiative, and power to at- 
tack and work out geographical facts and relations 
for himself. 
Development with textbook. — Even when textbooks 
are used there is still much opportunity for oral instruc- 
tion. The usual method of “ reciting’? on the book 
is only a pitiable apology for oral instruction, The
-P-A-G-E-29
OBSERVATIONAL METHOD OF INSTRUCTION 17 
teacher who is not a slave to her book, who has a wider 
knowledge of the subject through collateral reading, 
and a knowledge of broad underlying principles, will 
not teach thus.. She will appreciate the fact that parrot- 
ing of ill-digested or totally misunderstood book state- 
ments, or even giving back the words of the book 
though understood, is not sufficient. She will do more 
than just “hear recitations.” 
Supplementing the text. — There is plenty of chance 
and need for the teacher to do some real, oral teaching, 
even when the pupils have studied the lesson in a 
book. For what has been studied must yet be developed, 
explained, illustrated by picture or word description; 
comparison must be made with the concrete experience 
of the pupils; or cross references to previous lessons 
that serve to elucidate must be brought out. In other 
words, the recitation, though based upon a book, should 
be considered an opportunity for thoughtful discussion 
of what has been assigned. It is safe to assume, in the 
more difficult lessons, involving abstract principles, 
causal connections, and correlations, that such are not 
fully appreciated, and need further discussion and organ- 
izing. This is the teacher’s opportunity. As far as 
possible, let the pupils work out their own salvation. But 
there will always be need for developing and organizing. 
It is not too much to say that the teacher should present, 
in addition to what is given in the briefer. textbooks, as 
Cc 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  
18 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
much more of material which has a proper bearing on 
the topic. 
Oral development before book study. — Many diffi- 
cult lessons should be taught orally before they are 
assigned ina text. In this case, presentation by develop- 
ment is usually best. The principles and data of pre- 
vious lessons needed for appreciating the new should 
be recalled. |By directions and questions, the pupils 
should be led ‘tothink out the new lessons for themselves. 
The teacher presents the illustrative material, guides 
the course of the lesson, and arranges the matter so 
that the pupils make the necessary inferences, find the 
geographical data desired, form definitions, or generalize 
the geographical principles involved. After that the 
textbook will be understood, and is useful for review 
and drill. This is the German method, and it is ad- 
mittedly the best. | 
This discussion has been presented to emphasize the 
importance of oral instruction and to insist upon a 
rational use of the textbook. It does not mean that the 
teacher must plan courses or lessons outside of the book. 
She may follow exactly the order of the book, and yet 
carry out the above suggestions. No textbook can take 
the space, however, to recall the foundation facts for each 
lesson, nor give all the elaboration needful, or give the 
pupil the necessary application and drill. These must 
always be supplied by the teacher.
-P-A-G-E-31
  OBSERVATIONAL METHOD OF INSTRUCTION 19 
Oral work in topical study. — In the topical and type 
study method (Chapter XIX) in upper grades, however, 
the teacher (or supervisor) needs to make her plan 
different from that of the ordinary text. This suggests 
another opportunity for independence from the textbook 
and for oral instruction.
-P-A-G-E-32
  CHAPTER IV 
HOW TO USE THE TEXTBOOK 
Necessity for the textbook. — The limits of Home 
Geography are comparatively narrow. To know about 
the regions beyond the horizon of actual experience, 
dependence must be placed on hearsay evidence, that of 
eyewitnesses (explorers and travelers), authors (com- 
pilers), and teachers. This must necessarily remain 
the chief means of acquisition of geographical knowledge, 
and herein lies the main danger of geographical in- 
struction. 
Pedagogy of textbook.— Textbooks, to-day, are more 
than books on subject matter. They represent the 
methods and advice of the best instructors. This a 
teacher should bear in mind before trying to improve on 
the scheme and making out a course of her own. The 
approach to the subject, the general arrangement and 
order of topics, and the general relations and principles 
to be derived from this order, are all the result of practi- 
cal teaching experience and wisdom. Many textbooks 
not only give explicit directions to the teacher as to teach- 
ing methods, but also take into account the pupil’s 
difficulty, and provide for it by careful arrangement and 
20
-P-A-G-E-33
22 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
when a pupil flounders; which does not stop to permit 
reflection; which does not repeat, and in somewhat 
different language, to give the pupil another chance to 
grasp its meaning; which does not see when the pupil 
has forgotten, at least for the moment, some facts of a 
previous lesson necessary as an apperceptive basis for the 
new, and so does-not~make-helpful_cross-connections ; 
~ which does not stop to clinch the facts learned by means 
of the necessary drill. The living teacher only can do 
all this. 
The mode of presentation in a textbook of geography 
is usually a formal, rather dogmatic statement of prin- 
ciples, and a laconic, descriptive narrative. Rarely, 
unless it be by map study, does a textbook elicit or 
develop a lesson. The tendency, therefore, particularly 
with young children, is toread the text without reflection 
and judgment, and to rely too much on the easier and 
quicker method of committing to memory. 
The textbook presents in clear, systematic, though 
usually uninteresting form, the essential facts of the 
subject. School geographies are generally mere epito- 
mes. As a “Leitfaden,” a sort of daily reference book 
with which to work out assignments for lessons, and for 
reviews of orally presented lessons, textbooks are highly 
useful. “After all, the textbook is as good or as bad as 
it is allowed to be.” (Conwentz.) 
The teacher should repeat often to herself and to her 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  HOW TO USE THE TEXTBOOK 21 
typography, and sometimes by definite hints for study, 
suggestions for self-testing, questions and exercises to 
stimulate pupils to make applications, and references for 
collateral reading. Teachers will do well to follow these 
authors’ suggestions seriously. 
Shortcomings of textbooks.—The ordinary elemen- 
tary school textbook in geography cannot, however, 
do justice to the subject. The science is altogether too 
comprehensive and rich in content to remain interesting 
after being condensed into the limits of books of the 
usual size. By the unavoidable compression, the living 
juice of the subject — that is, the incidental allusions to 
history, the references to science for explanation, the 
numerous cross-references needed to knit together old 
facts and new, — these must all be left out, and the result 
_is the usual formal, terse, laconic, uninteresting text- 
book, the dry bones of the subject. The essential facts 
are all there, to be sure. But they need the living voice 
of the teacher to make them real and vivid. They must 
be largely supplemented to become interesting. There 
are some textbooks in use now that attempt to supply 
what these others lack.   
Supplementary readers are a device to furnish ad- 
ditional matter, and to infuse life and interest. (Chap- 
ter XIII.) 
The textbook cannot, moreover, do justice to the pupil. 
It is an unconscious, inanimate teacher which cannot see
-P-A-G-E-35
  HOW TO USE THE TEXTBOOK 23 
pupils that the book is but a means, not-an end. The 
book is not geography itself, but about geography; 
and it is necessary for the reader to project his imagina- 
tion to the real people, the real occupations, the real 
scenery, and earth features and forces so meagerly 
and faintly represented by the printed page. i 
The geography the first information book. — It is a 
noteworthy point that the first book given to pupils, 
from which they are to get information or facts, is a 
geography. True, they have readers, spellers, and 
other books before this, but these are chiefly to develop 
the art of expression. Geographies are given for the 
study of facts. But the pupils have not yet learned to 
study for information. In fact, they still have their dif- 
ficulties with the mechanical side of reading. Onply in 
recent years has this matter of study been taken up in 
General Method. Some few of the later geographies 
have valuable hints to the pupil advising him how to 
use the text. 
The introduction of the textbook should be gradual. 
Home geography requires no text. The first geography 
should be taught orally. Butin the first course in general 
descriptive geography a. book should be used. The 
first lessons in the book should be studied in the reci- 
tation, in school. Let the teacher tell her pupils the 
purpose of the book, and ask them to read silently, 
Sor the thought, a paragraph or so, and then aloud. The 
ces 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
24 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
teacher should test the pupil to see if he has understood 
what he read by requiring him to repeat in his own words. 
It is important (some definitions excepted) to demand 
that the pupils paraphrase and not use the identical 
words of the book. The pupil should be taught to dis- 
tinguish the difference between words and ideas. It is 
in such study that the true function of the teacher lies 
— to guide and assist the pupil in learning for himself. 
Sympathy, patience, skill, and ingenuity are all required 
for this. 
The teacher herself should show an attitude of interest. 
This will make the pupils more enthusiastic. A teacher 
who “hates” geography and shows it cannot hope to 
succeed in interesting others in it. 
During such study lessons the teacher should use 
illustrative material, appropriate stories, and descrip- 
tions drawn-from outside the text. She should explain 
and elaborate and make thoroughly interesting what the 
textbook has treated so briefly. 
Methods of study. — As the pupil gets older he may be 
permitted to base his preparation more and more upon 
the text and other books. By this time he should have 
learned to study independently. He should not try to 
memorize the words, but should seek to retain the 
information contained in them, the facts, the ideas. 
While reading a paragraph or a page he should con- 
sciously try to find out ‘‘ what the author is trying to tell
-P-A-G-E-37
HOW TO USE THE TEXTBOOK 25 
him.” He should know how to read a portion thinkingly, 
then close the book and tell himself what he has learned. 
It is a good plan to note down a brief, logical memoran- 
dum of each portion as acquired. This should not be a 
copy, but the gist of the matter, in the pupil’s own lan- 
guage. The teacher should show the pupil how to make 
outlines, synopses, or summaries of study. One reading 
is usually not sufficient to clinch the study. (The first 
reading is to dig out the isolated-facts; the second, to 
organize them into a whole or unity, This organizing 
is often best done in class with the aid of the teacher. 
Blackboard synopses or summaries ‘are a useful help. 
The younger pupils cannot make these unaided, though 
older children should. The teacher should in the recita- 
tion help to bring out the relation of the various ideas 
of the lesson, arranging them in a synopsis, as main 
topic, subordinate topics, codrdinate topics, etc.; or 
welding them all together into a general principle. 
This unifying work, so often sadly neglected or taken for 
granted, is the climax of the lesson. After all, the im- 
portant thing is not so much to learn the thousand and 
one facts of geography, as their relations, and the prin- 
ciples they embody. 
If geography is as serious business as this, no wonder 
that school officers often suggest that no home work 
be assigned in it, but that it be studied at school under 
the guidance of the teacher.
-P-A-G-E-38
  
26 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
ZMethods of assignment. — The success or failure of the 
lesson is largely due to the way it has been assigned. In 
spite of ridicule, the practice of assigning the new lesson 
as “so many pages” still persists. Some of the old 
geographies of a hundred years ago were thus divided, 
without reference to the unity or natural relations of 
the subject, into ‘“‘lessons,”’ each about as much as could 
be mastered daily, the end coming anywhere, perhaps 
in the middle of a topic. 
Time is not wasted in the careful assignment of a 
lesson, —in fact, just the reverse. For beginners, the 
teacher may very profitably read aloud through the 
lesson, dwelling on this point or that, to elucidate, or show 
which is the important, which the incidental, and finally 
briefly summarizing. 
Or, if the pupils are older, as an aim or interest a sort 
of title may be given to the lesson, in the light of which it 
is to be studied: “ In to-morrow’s lesson you will learn 
how —— came to be located, and why it grew to be such 
alarge city.” ‘‘ The next lesson tells you what the people 
do for a living.” ‘ This lesson tells you how irriga~ 
tion is carried on.” 
Again, pupils may be given sets ¢ of i definite, properly 
organized questions, the answers to which they are to 
find inthe text: ‘ Where is Alaska? To whom did it 
formerly belong? What native peoples live there? 
Learn about their houses, clothing, food, amusements,
-P-A-G-E-39
  
HOW TO USE THE TEXTBOOK 27 
home life.” Etc. This suggests the proper emphasis, and 
leads to definiteness in preparation. 
A similar plan is to write a synoptical outline as a 
guide for study in which, through heads and subheads, 
the proper relationships may be indicated. 
Older pupils should occasionally be given little 
geographical problems to work out: ‘ The next lesson is 
The Rainfall of the Western Half of the United States. 
Study the rainfall conditions from the coast to the Great 
Plains. First review page —, which tells about the pre- 
vailing winds in that latitude; page — about rain; and 
page — about the topography of that section. Refer 
also to the relief map, page —. Then read the new 
lesson, from the bottom of page — to the middle of page 
—-, connecting with the old lessons above-mentioned. 
Note where the greatest rainfall occurs, and find the 
reason; where the least, and why. Compare your 
reading with the rainfall map, page —. Also read 
page — of Supplementary Reader.” 
To these suggestions may be added that the lesson, 
especially if it is a difficult one, should sometimes take 
the form of an oral development. After this the pupil 
may review the matter in the text. 
In topical and type studies great care must be used 
to give definite directions as to what to study, and where 
to find it. Here the consecutive order of a textbook may 
not be followed, but the material may have to be gathered
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
by the pupils from various parts of the textbook, from 
supplementary readers, magazines, encyclopedias, and 
other sources. The pupils should be taught how to 
use an index and table of contents; though, to begin 
with, references should be assigned definitely by page. 
Such careful assignments not only tell the pupils what 
to study, but teach them to discriminate, and above all 
to see that the textbook is not an end, but a means. 
They do much to provoke interest in the new lesson, and 
prevent the textbook work from becoming purely me- 
moriter, than which nothing can be more stupid and dull. 
Relation of lessons to the course. — It is obvious that 
the method of assignment and presentation indicated 
require that the teacher do more than merely study 
each lesson at the same time as the pupil. It is a shift- 
less, hand-to-the-mouth policy, where the teacher assigns 
merely by so many pages, or the next section, without 
clearly knowing what these are about. It is disastrous 
to the children. The teacher owes it to herself and her 
pupils to have a wider view of her subject than this. . 
Naturally, by teaching the same grade work year after 
year she gets the relations of the lessons in her grade. 
But in teaching a course the teacher should know its 
scope, order, and relation to the work of the grades 
below and above. She should read far enough ahead of 
her class to see to what to-morrow’s lesson is leading. 
In this way the lessons are not isolated, and dislocated ;
-P-A-G-E-41
HOW TO USE THE TEXTBOOK 29 
but are organized to carry out a definite scheme of 
presentation. 
The suggestions here offered are not intended to in- 
crease the burdens of the teacher, but rather to assist her 
to systematize and economize her school energies. In 
the end, the methods that economize and make efficient 
the pupils’ efforts are an economy and satisfaction to 
the teacher.

  CHAPTER V 
HOME GEOGRAPHY 
“Tn the place where a child lives should he first find his 
orientation in reality and study the region in all its relation- 
ships.” — RITTER. i 
Synthetic growth of geographical knowledge. — The 
earliest study of a child is getting his bearings in the 
world. Sight, touch, and hearing-teach the child the 
first rudiments of space relations. The narrow circle of 
the horizon of the infant thus enlarges from the cradle to 
the home, then to the garden, in widening reaches. Then 
the home block is explored, and a mental map is made 
of it. The children on the block, and the grown people, 
their games and their work ; the corner grocery ; the black- 
smith’s and the carpenter’s shop near by ; the wagons and 
cars coming from outside his known world and vanishing 
again into regions unknown; the flowers, trees, birds, 
insects, and other life; the weather, pleasant and un- 
pleasant; the winds for paper windmills and kites; the 
cold that makes good sleighing and skating ; the beautiful 
moon and stars, —all these and many more —all true 
geographical matter, the little child gets acquainted 
with, and this for the most part without instruction from 
30 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  HOME GEOGRAPHY 31 
others, though frequently his irrepressible curiosity leads 
him to some unfathomable problem and he questions 
his elders, “‘ Why? ” a 
First geography by observation.— This early self- 
instruction through personal experiences and direct ob- 
servation is the most vivid and real geography possible, 
and furnishes the concrete basis upon which the less 
tangible geography of regions beyond the reach of ex- 
perience must rest. 
This getting acquainted with the home region is Home 
Geography. We talk about beginning it in the third 
or fourth school year. The fact is, the child began it 
years before, and we but continue the study. Being a 
natural mode of learning, one in which the child is 
practiced, it should be continued in school to still further 
enlarge the view of the world. 
Home geography is the study of the~occupations, 
historic associations, and civic life of the community ; 
it includes the first lessons on land and water forms — 
hills, valleys, brooks, rocks, soil, scenery ; on the weather 
and the seasons. It is a very simple study, and there is 
nothing technical about it. 
The scope of home geography varies according to 
the location and conditions of the school. The home 
geography of a place should have something peculiar 
to that place. The historic factor of one locality would 
differ from that of another; the industrial factor would
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
show some difference; the physiographic features would 
be more alike, probably, though with differences. Home 
geography connects with and includes the nature-study 
of previous grades, the animals and vegetal life, and the 
natural phenomena. These all help to paint the local 
picture. 
* For knowledge of locality. — Home geography, a 
composite study of many local elements, is taught that 
the pupils may come to know their local environment, 
and so, even as children, and later as citizens, appreciate it 
the more, and adapt themselves better to it. One of the 
most powerful primal instincts is the love of home. 
Even national patriotism is but a phase of this feeling. 
It is therefore of the highest civic importance that the 
geography of the home be taught. 
As a basis for world geography. — From a pedagogical 
standpoint, also, home geography is the only rational basis 
for advanced geography. Ziller was first to recognize 
this as a working principle of geography teaching. It 
is through what we know of the home district that we 
judge the world. By imagination, the wayside stream 
is expanded into a mighty river; the local hills become 
the Alps; the ordinary simple relations with the shop 
and store become manufacturing and international com- 
merce. The simple concepts of home geography are the 
types with which we compare the features of foreign lands. 
Here the need of real observation and personal experience
-P-A-G-E-45
  HOME GEOGRAPHY 33 
is clearly seen. The concepts thus formed are not ab- 
stract, hazy, vague, and unreal, but definite and real. 
By continuing the method of observational study, the 
school can add to such stock of definite notions. What 
the child has “ picked up” untaught, or self-tutored, 
may be studied further in detail, and added to, and new 
relations may be shown therein, or new lines followed. 
Home geography in upper grades. — A more intensive 
course in home geography should be given in the upper 
grades when the pupils can appreciate the more complex 
relations of commercial and civic life, and know more of 
history. It is true that local physiography is studied in 
the upper grades, but the human side is neglected. 
The center of each person’s world is the home locality. — 
The rest of the world is important only so far as it is 
related to the home region. The place where people 
spend most of their lives is worthy of a deeper study 
than can be given it in the primary grades. It is a 
mistake to drop home geography there. In every grade 
it can be made use of to add vividness and reality to 
general geography. 
In European practice home geography is realized 
more fully by studying geography on the radial plan; 
that is, starting from the home region along certain 
lines of historic, political, or commercial interest to more 
distant centers, and returning to start anew in some 
other direction to again connect with other centers 
D
-P-A-G-E-46
  
34 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
more or less closely associated with the home re- 
gion. A very practical unity is thus furnished for 
the subject. 
The synthetic method in geography: Induction. — 
In general, in home geography the child proceeds from 
the known to the unknown in enlarging, concentric 
circles, or lengthening radii. This is the Synthetic 
Method, building up a larger whole from the details. It 
is also Inductive: from a group of related facts the child 
makes simple generalizations, which he applies deduc- 
tively to new cases. He may not be conscious of the 
logic of his thoughts, and just how he gets his generaliza- 
tions, nor may he be able to state these in words, and 
yet he has some concepts and principles useful for 
daily application. 
Field lessons. — The ideal way to teach home geog- 
raphy is without a textbook. The book habit usually 
vitiates its spirit. The best way to form correct con- 
cepts of real things is not to read about them in a book, 
but to observe the things themselves. Just as travel is the 
ideal and most pleasant way of studying foreign places, 
so travel at home is the ideal method of studying the 
home environment. Field lessons, excursions, visits to 
historic places, visits to museums and other places of 
interest, collecting trips, are under the right conditions 
delightful, proper, and very pedagogical methods of 
learning home geography.
-P-A-G-E-47
  
HOME GEOGRAPHY 35 
Every one travels more or less about the home locality. 
Our walks and rides about town are, however, usually 
limited to our routine paths of business and occasional 
pleasure, and most of us could find many places of human 
or natural interest with which we are still unfamiliar. 
It is a common remark, especially in larger places, that 
visitors who come for sight-seeing know more of a place 
than the natives. Many delightful discoveries can be 
made by going out of our usual path occasionally, going 
to our destination by one route, returning by another. 
The exploring instinct, if kept alive, will do much to 
add pleasure and interest, to vary the monotony of rou- 
tine, and to increase the appreciation of the home com- 
munity. 
Field lessons in country and city. — In rural districts 
field lessons on earth features and earth forces, on vege- 
tation and animal life, and the country industries will be 
most feasible. In cities the human phase of geography 
is most easily observed, though the physical is by no 
means lacking. It is surprising, when one seeks for it, 
to find so much of nature in the heart of a big city. The 
city-bred teacher is apt to overlook it. We see that in 
which we are most interested. The city inhabitant is 
most interested in man and his ways. Perhaps that is 
all the more reason for teaching a city child how to find 
nature also. : 
Field lessons are not necessarily far afield, and are not

forms, etc. The neighboring streets display a wealth 
of topics from human geography, — races, nationalities, 
customs, costumes, various trades and shops, many 
products and manufactures, intercourse, transportation 
and commerce, evidences of the civic organization, etc. 
It is a mistake to go miles for what may be found close 
at hand. 
Since near-by field lessons will entail no difficulties as 
to time, permission from school authorities and parents, 
long distances and carfare, dangerous crossings, etc., 
there is little excuse for teachers in cities near large parks 
or in the outskirts, or in village and country schools for 
not giving field lessons. But itis well to remember that 
the mechanical difficulties of mass teaching, and the 
ordinary routine of a large school system, render field 
lessons at a considerable distance well-nigh impossible. 
Much is usually made of the European practice of taking 
pupils on long walking trips, or even excursions of several 
days. This is, however, generally only in the smaller
-P-A-G-E-49
HOME GEOGRAPHY 37 
places and special schools, and with older students. It 
is absolutely foolish and dangerous to undertake long 
field trips with little children through large cities. 
Every parent knows the responsibilities of trying to 
manage his own flock on such occasions, and has a perfect 
right to refuse to let his children go on a long trip with 
a large class, under the management perhaps of only 
a single teacher. It is highly commendable, however, 
for a teacher to chaperon a small, enthusiastic group of 
pupils who are especially desirous of making a field trip. 
Much is also made of visiting shops, factories, and 
other industrial places. This also is desirable, if done 
without compulsion and with real interest, by small 
parties. But if the practice should become universal, 
these industrial plants, and many public institutions, 
must close their doors to such visits because of too great 
interference with the regular business. So long as the 
thing is not overdone, such visits are usually not denied, 
and often welcomed. It goes without saying that per- 
mission should always first be sought to visit places 
not generally open to the public. This avoids disap- 
pointment and trouble, and often secures a pleasant re- 
ception, official guides and instructors. 
Again, it must be remembered that a visit to a flour 
mill, for example, is not only a very risky thing on 
account of the many dangerous belts and cogwheels 
of the machinery, but is generally absolutely worthless 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
from the standpoint of a study of the process. Here, 
as in many another modern industrial plant, the process 
is so specialized, and divided up, and carried on in so 
many different parts of the mill, that a child, or even a 
grown person, would get practically no concept of the 
actual process, except of its marvelous complexity and 
system. 
In visiting museums and collections, too much should 
not be attempted. ‘The visit should be for the study of 
a limited portion of the exhibit of special geographical 
interest, related to the current work. 
So it is necessary to use common sense about field 
lessons.. Where it can be done easily and _ safely, 
and does not require too great a sacrifice of time, they 
should be given occasionally. Otherwise, they had bet- 
ter be dispensed with. 
Observational geography without field lessons. — It 
is fortunate that the average child, even a city child 
in the most congested section, is in the habit, and has 
been for years, of using his eyes and ears, and has al- 
ready, on entering school, a foundation of real geographi- 
cal experiences so great that all the field lessons possible 
under adverse conditions would be but “a drop in the 
bucket ” in comparison. It is the accidental and inci- 
dental observations of daily life that furnish the child 
his real geography. Children should be encouraged to 
be interested in what goes on around them, to watch
-P-A-G-E-51
  
HOME GEOGRAPHY 39 
the life and the occupations of the community, and to 
note the local physical features. The show windows 
with wares on display (sometimes showing processes of 
manufacture); the open door of the blacksmith’s, 
shoemaker’s, and carpenter’s shops; the ships at the 
docks; the drays hauling the merchandise of the world 
through the streets; the bridges, ferries, trains; the 
telephone and telegraph; public parks and pleasure 
resorts; zodlogical gardens and museums; the local 
hills, valleys, and streams, all appeal daily to the child’s 
curiosity. He knows, perhaps, where the Soldiers’ 
Monument is, and the flour mill, though he may 
not know the history of the former, nor the process 
in the latter. But the history of the monument may 
be just as well taught in school, and the process of 
making flour can be shown, even more clearly than in 
the mill itself, by the simple experiment of grinding 
some grain, according to the primitive method, be- 
tween two stones. 
Illustrative material in classroom.— Even where 
field lessons cannot be safely or economically given, 
reliance should be placed on the pupil’s store of direct 
knowledge, and with this foundation of reality, the topics 
of home geography should be further developed by means 
of specimens, experiments, pictures, and other illustra- 
tive material. Thus the teaching may be still concrete, 
and not by the book. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  
40 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Sometimes “ the mountain may be brought to Ma- 
homet,”” — experiments on evaporation and condensa- 
tion bring the rain into the schoolroom, teaching, in 
fact, something not so clearly seen in the natural process 
outside. A river may be made in a sand tray, and would 
show, more easily, because under much better control, 
than the Hudson or the Mississippi, the processes of 
erosion, transportation, and deposit. True, a sand 
tray river and mountain are pathetic imitations of the 
real thing, but are the next best thing when the real 
river or mountain is inaccessible. Better these symbols 
than word symbols alone. A sand model of a moun- 
tain, of course, would be out of place in a Swiss school, 
or in Denver. In the country, where a brook flows 
near the school, or in the city, if there is one in an easily 
accessible park, or suburban district, the schoolroom 
brook would be a farce. The wise teacher would wait 
for a rainy day for observation of the brook in the gutter. 
Preparation for a field lesson. — Field lessons require 
careful preparation. The teacher should know her 
subject matter. She should visit the place and note the 
best ways and means of getting there, the difficulties to 
be encountered, the abundance or absence of data for 
observation, etc. She should plan the order of study 
to give it unity. 
-A definite aim should be given for the trip. “We shall 
look in at the shoemaker’s shop to see how shoes are
-P-A-G-E-53
HOME GEOGRAPHY 41 
made.” “It hasstopped raining. Let us go outside and 
look at the water running in the gutter to see what it can 
teach us.” ‘‘We have been reading about the Indians. 
We are going to the museum to look at Indian weapons, 
tools, clothing, etc.” Such a prelude will focus at- 
tention, and give a definite purpose. 
Management of classes. — The shorter outdoor lessons 
may be given in school hours. Longer ones had better 
be taken after school, or on Saturdays. Some school 
authorities set aside certain days to be used for field 
lessons. Sometimes the last period of the day is used and 
the time extended to after school hours. For trips out of 
school hours no compulsion as to attendance should be 
exercised. ‘For trips involving any responsibility the 
parents’ consent should be secured, and any trips after 
school hours should be announced beforehand to the 
parents. In the poorer communities carfare and other 
expenses must be taken into account. 
Children should not be taxed beyond their strength 
on excursions. If the distance is too great for walking 
there and back with ease, it must be abandoned, or 
transportation provided. In large cities this is a special 
problem. It is possible to charter special street cars, 
sight-seeing automobiles, or boats. Otherwise there is 
always the liability of a large party being divided in 
trying to secure passage in public conveyances. 
It is useless to try to take a class of forty or fifty pupils,
-P-A-G-E-54
  
42 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
except on shorter trips in the immediate vicinity of the 
school. For more extended trips, the teacher should have 
assistance, or the class should be divided into manage- 
able sections. Sometimes mothers may be invited to 
help supervise the children. This stimulates interest in 
the trip. 
A good disciplinarian will have no special trouble on 
field trips. Naturally the pupils will feel less restraint on 
such occasions than in school, but they should attend 
strictly to the business in hand, and remain in a more or 
less compact body near the teacher, ever ready to respond 
to her directions and her discussions of the topic of study. 
Unless the trip is planned with care and executed with 
promptness, firmness, and common sense, and with its 
purpose always in mind, it is apt to turn into a “lark” 
for the pupils, and, as Samantha Allen would say, “a 
pleasure exertion” for the teacher. 
Method of instruction.— The presentation of the 
outdoor lessons may be less formal than in school, but 
should follow in general the same practice. The pupils 
should be led to see things for themselves, and to think 
about them. Questions and directions by the teacher 
should guide the observation and reasoning. Physical 
features and forces are best studied thus by develop- 
ment. Industrial and historical topics are better treated 
in a simple lecture by the teacher. The children should 
be allowed to contribute whatever they can. Field les-
-P-A-G-E-55
HOME GEOGRAPHY 43 
sons should be reviewed and amplified in school after 
the trip, and application should be made of what was 
thus learned. Textbook study and supplementary 
reading should follow a field trip. 
Theoretically, a field lesson should precede the study 
of the topic in school. Then the trip is one of discovery. 
Practically it is common to take a class on an excursion 
after one or several topics have been studied, and an 
interest in them has been aroused. Then the trip be- 
comes one of verification or corroboration of the previous 
study. This method economizes in the time spent on 
the trip. A considerable amount of subject matter can 
thus be covered. 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
CHAPTER VI 
LESSONS IN HOME GEOGRAPHY TO 
ILLUSTRATE METHOD 
A few concrete examples of subject matter and 
method of presentation are given below, not to furnish a 
course, but to illustrate the foregoing chapters, and to 
bring out special points in method. 
Points of the compass. — The sun is the most common 
means of orientation used in life. Note the place of 
sunrise and sunset, and the direction of the sun at noon. 
Also find north. Fix the names of these directions. 
The directions may be marked in the schoolroom with 
letters on the walls, or with crosslines on the floor or 
ceiling. A weather vane on the school, or on a pole in 
the yard, helps to make a habit of getting one’s bearings. 
Locational ideas in geography rest upon this basis of 
orientation. In home geography application of the 
points of the compass should be made in pointing towards 
familiar places, or in going to them. 
An interesting exercise is to determine the noon shadow 
of a vertical stick placed in a south window, or in the 
schoolyard. The north and south line can thus be de- 
termined with fair accuracy. 
44
-P-A-G-E-57
HOME GEOGRAPHY TO ILLUSTRATE METHOD 45 
The pupils are old enough to be interested in the mag- 
netic compass. This should be shown and its operation 
taught. The pupils would like to make their own com- 
passes from magnetized knitting needles, watch spring, 
or other hard steel. A compass used on a field trip 
would add interest and assist in mapping out the district. 
Finding the north by the North Star is also an interesting 
exercise. The well-known fact that moss and alge grow 
more abundantly on the shady, damp, north side of 
trees, rocks, walls, etc., may also be brought out by 
observation. 
Bird’s-eye view. — In many cases it is possible to get a 
general view of the locality from some high hill or build- 
ing, perhaps from the roof or upper windows of the 
school. This is a very instructive lesson for locating 
the different sections of the community, prominent local 
natural features, buildings, etc., and for getting relations 
otherwise not easily seen. Use the points of the com- 
pass. This study is excellent as a basis for the concep- 
tion of a map. 
Occupations and trades.— Children know enough 
about the commoner occupations to serve as a basis for 
an indoor lesson. The aim is not so much to learn a 
special trade as to teach certain principles of geography, 
—about raw material and the finished product ; division 
of labor; interdependence of people; value of invention, 
labor, and money, in industry ; need or demand (market),  
-P-A-G-E-58
  
46 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
buying and selling; communication, transportation, and 
commerce. It must be remembered that some of these 
terms may be out of place in home geography. The 
principles they stand for need not be forced upon the 
attention of the children. The teacher, however, 
should keep them in mind, as the geographical purpose 
of these industrial lessons. These generalizations will 
not come all at once, in the first lesson. Only after many 
lessons, perhaps only after months, do these facts gradu- 
ally dawn on the pupil’s mind. Even though the tools, 
materials, and processes are soon forgotten by the pupil, 
he will retain a useful residue for the further appreciation 
of other industrial studies. 
To the child, carpentry, blacksmithing, bread-making, 
are not as interesting as the carpenter, the blacksmith, 
and the baker. It is the personal element, the human 
element, that appeals. Therefore such lessons should 
be presented for the most part, or at least introduced, 
from the personal side. 
These lessons should be based on the previous ex- 
perience of the children, perhaps on preliminary, indi- 
vidual observations, under direction, or, if convenient, 
by the whole class visiting the place of the trade or 
occupation. Specimens of the commercial materials 
used, possibly tools and pictures, add to the reality 
of the schoolroom lesson. Some of the processes may be 
illustrated by simple experiments.  
-P-A-G-E-59
  
HOME GEOGRAPHY TO ILLUSTRATE METHOD 47 
Primitive methods of primitive peoples appeal more 
to the child than the highly specialized modern pro- 
cesses. Nothing could show more clearly the making of 
flour than the simple schoolroom experiment of crushing 
and grinding wheat between two stones, and sifting the 
flour from the bran, as some Indian tribes and other 
races still do. This is the process of the modern mill 
in epitome. The threshing process is just as simply 
shown by rubbing some heads of wheat in the palm of 
the hand, thus shelling the kernels. Then by blowing 
away the chaff the winnowing is illustrated. A child 
would get very little from a visit to a spinning factory, 
yet the process may be nicely shown by twisting some 
parallel fibers of cottcn or other material between 
the fingers till a firm, strong yarn or thread is formed. 
The complicated modern weaving process can be beauti- 
fully typified on the ordinary school hand loom. 
Sometimes these primitive atts are appropriately 
studied in correlation with studies of primitive peoples, 
as, for example, the story of Hiawatha. A natural and 
artistic setting is then given to such a study. Children 
also like to make believe they are primitive people, or 
Robinson Crusoes, and their imaginary necessities may 
be used to stimulate their inventiveness in working out 
experimentally these simple arts. 
Nature-study and geography should be correlated in 
these industrial studies. Through the former, the pupil
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
should learn the origin and nature of the more common 
animal and vegetable materials used in commerce, — 
wheat, corn, pine, flax, cattle, sheep, iron, copper, granite, 
marble, etc. (See Chapter XXI, Correlation of Nature 
Study and Geography.) 
Begin the teaching of industries with the study of 
local types like the following : 
The blacksmith. — Where is the shop? Describe the 
smith; appearance, strength, clothing. Why “ black ” 
smith? Quotation from Longfellow’s The Village Black- 
smith to interest the children in his personality. Do 
you like to look into his shop? Why? What isit like? 
What does he do? Describe the forge and bellows 
(drawings), the anvil, tools. The melody of the anvil. 
The sparks. Why must the iron be heated? (Experi- 
ment with sealing wax, glass, or pieces of iron wire.) 
What does the smith make of the iron? Process of 
making a horseshoe. (Show shoe, nails.) How a horse 
is shod. For whom does the :blacksmith do this 
work? Why does not every man shoe his own horse? 
How do other people serve the blacksmith? Why is 
a blacksmith shop likely to be found at country cross- 
roads? (Illustrate the study with appropriate anec- 
dotes.) 
The grocer. —,In this study of foods begin at the 
home: The family need. Trace foodstuffs from the 
grocery back to the market; to the truck garden out:
-P-A-G-E-61
HOME GEOGRAPHY TO ILLUSTRATE METHOD 49 
side of the town; to the farms; perhaps to other parts 
of the nation; and even to foreign lands. Ideas of 
ultimate sources of food supply, shipment, means of 
transportation, commerce, are taught by this lesson. 
Transportation. — Study the delivery of packages from 
the store. What is a delivery boy? A truckman? 
An express company? Assistance from beasts of burden. 
Importance of the horse. Other animals used in other 
lands. The need of good roads and streets. Simple 
sketch of road-making process. Brief study of some 
principal roads leading out of town. Whither do they 
lead? Are roads always straight? Why not? Hills, 
lakes, rivers, as obstacles, and how avoided or sur- 
mounted.- Why does a road often go around a hill? 
Why located in valleys of rivers or mountains? Sketch 
of traffic as observed by children. Different kinds of 
vehicles, and their uses. Different kinds of things 
transported. Trace some of these staples from farm, 
forest, or mine to city; from shop and factory to homes 
and stores; from the steamboat landing and the rail- 
road station to the factory or store, etc. Follow with 
the study of shipping and railroads. 
Such lessons should at least teach the worth of labor, 
and the interdependence of man and man. Keep the 
local color — do not teach in an abstract, colorless way. 
Try to get children to call up in imagination the familiar 
places referred to.

-P-A-G-E-62
  50 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
The fruit stand. — Ask the pupils to observe the 
variety of fruits and nuts offered for sale. Let them note 
the labels, or inquire of the dealer as to the source of 
various fruits. Thus they will discover oranges from 
Florida, figs from Turkey, dates from Algeria, blueberries 
from Cape Cod, nuts from Brazil, pecans from Louisiana, 
apples from New York, etc. Perhaps the pupils will 
bring specimens of fruit to school for an exhibit. The 
materials should also be used in the nature lessons. 
This study of fruits may be used as an approach to foreign 
geography. Many a child, like Mignon, has longed to 
fly to the land where the oranges grow. 
Civics from home geography. — Children are not old 
enough to appreciate the subject of local government in 
its official and legal aspects. There is, however, a side 
that appeals ; and through this, rudiments of civics may 
be presented. The administrative side interests pupils. 
The policeman on his post, the firehouse around the 
corner, the postman who brings the daily mail, the street 
cleaner, the ash man, etc., mean more to the child than 
mayor, treasurer, aldermen, judges, etc. They come 
more directly and frequently into the child’s life, and the 
work of these public servants may teach pupils a respect 
for law and order, and simple duties as little citizens. 
The heroic element in the lives of these men should 
be shown. The instinct of hero worship in the child 
will respond to it.
-P-A-G-E-63
HOME GEOGRAPHY TO ILLUSTRATE METHOD 51 
Historic studies. — These should be based upon visits 
to historic places of the locality, historic buildings, and 
monuments. There is no place so young that it does 
not have something of a past, though it may glory 
chiefly in its future. The early, primeval condition, 
incidents of its founding, reason for its location, brief 
sketch of great events in its history, simple sketches of 
its great men, buildings of historic interest, monuments to 
commemorate men and events, are topics to be studied. 
The study of history has not in these grades gone 
very far, and the teacher must be careful not to take 
the pupils beyond their depth into events they never 
heard of, and in which they are not interested. The 
reality of the scenes and incidents must be preserved 
by constant attachment to familiar objects and places, 
familiar names of families still represented, by relics 
and heirlooms loaned for the occasion, by facts the chil- 
dren may be able to gather from their parents, grand- 
parents, and “ the oldest inhabitant.” It should be the 
aim to develop through such lessons a sort of local 
patriotism. 
Hills and valleys. — These should be studied in a 
field lesson, if convenient. Hills and valleys give the 
child a notion of topography, ‘‘ the face of the land,” 
“the lay of the land,” so important in the map study 
later on. The actual climbing “ up hill and down dale” 
gives the child muscular sensations useful in appreciat- 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
ing the geographical side of the matter. The bird’s- 
eye view and the expanding horizon are also valuable. 
To children who have never seen mountains, hills must 
stand as prototypes. 
Follow a street, road, or path among the hills. Note 
how it conforms to the valley. Why? Leave the valley 
and climb a hill by the shortest route. Note the exertion. 
Change the ascent to a zigzag and note greater ease with 
gentler slope. Note how the roads choose the lowest 
grade or zigzag up the slopes. The study will emphasize 
the fact that hills are obstacles to travel and traffic. 
Note where the town is situated. Some towns for a 
special reason are located on the tops of hills, but most 
towns are on lower ground. Why? 
As the hill is climbed, note the water courses. Whither 
do they lead? Perhaps a stream occupies the lowest 
part of the valley, certainly in rainy weather. Let 
pupils trace the drainage. Let them see how the 
tributary streams come down the side valleys. Note 
the hills that separate one such tributary from its neigh- 
bor. The term divide or waterparting may be used. 
Arrived at the top, survey the landscape, the lay 
of the land as a bird sees it. Locate familiar places. 
Find directions with compass. Note the relation of the 
city to the surrounding farm lands. Note how “all the 
roads lead to Rome.” Refer to the travel and traffic. 
Note the enlarged horizon. Suggest idea of distant
-P-A-G-E-65
HOME GEOGRAPHY TO ILLUSTRATE METHOD 53 
towns beyond the reach of vision. Perhaps a train may 
be seen winding out of the town. Where is it going? 
The sense of freedom, the stronger breezes, the beauty 
of the landscape, the sky and atmospheric effects, should 
all be enjoyed. Is there any difference in vegetation on 
the north and south sides of a hill? Why? 
Note the hillside industries, —wood chopping, grazing ; 
orchards and farms on the lower slopes; perhaps quarry- 
ing or mining. 
As the descent is finished, again note the beauty of the 
hills, and the valleys between. Note the more imposing 
height, the sky line, the restricted horizon, the shadows 
and light effects, the beauty of forest-clad hills as com- 
pared with the balder heights from which the forests 
have been cleared. 
On the level prairie this lesson would be impossible. 
In the heart of a metropolis likewise. Yet here too, in 
less esthetic fashion, the idea of slope may and must be 
taught. The land is nowhere so level that water will 
not run off. In cities the paved streets are graded so as 
to slope from the middle to the sides, and toward the end 
of the block. These “hills,” or slopes, together with 
models of sand and pictures of real hills, must be used 
to develop the idea of topography. a 
the brook. — This is a good subject to stimulate the 
imagination. The average city child and teacher is 
more apt to think of Tennyson’s Brook than of the real Ts 
}  
-P-A-G-E-66
  54 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
thing; of the brook “in the country ” or “in the moun- 
tains,” but not in the city. 
If the school is conveniently situated near a brook, the 
best way is to take the class toit. In a congested city 
district, however, this is impossible. Fortunately, 
there is everywhere at hand a concrete, though prosaic, 
example of a “ brook”’; that is, the rain or snow water 
running in the gutters. A®sthetics aside, nothing better 
can be found than this to teach the essential geographical 
notions about streams, — source, slope, divide, water- 
shed, tributary, velocity, erosion, sediment, transporta- 
tion, deposit; and even falls, rapids, deltas, and lakes. 
The children of the city play in the gutter-brook, wading ; 
floating imaginary ships and toy boats; making bridges, 
dams, waterfalls; and even setting up miniature water 
wheels. Thus the childish play in the gutter is the 
basis for ideas of navigation, water power, commerce, 
and the physiography of streams. The city field lesson 
should be started at the gutter, and not in imagination 
in the country. 
The prosaic features of a brook may be farther repre- 
sented in a sand tray. If the teacher semi-seriously 
suggests, “ This is a hill,” ‘This is a rain storm” 
(sprinkling on water), ‘‘ And thisisa river,” the imagina- 
tion of the children will make believe that a larger ex- 
ample is before them. This classroom experiment shows 
finely all the physical features of running water.
-P-A-G-E-67
  
HOME GEOGRAPHY TO ILLUSTRATE METHOD 55 
The physiographic side of a brook should not be 
taught too technically, in the abstract, nor should it be 
left unconnected with the human side. The study should 
be very simple. ‘‘ What a brook can do,” or ‘‘ The work 
of the brook,” suggest the treatment better than “ ero- 
sion, transportation, and deposit.” The main physio- 
graphic facts to be learned at this stage are: that 
water flows downhill, and faster down the steeper slopes ; 
that running water can wear off and wash away mud, 
sand, and gravel, and that these are dropped here and 
there when the water stops flowing, or flows slowly; 
that valleys are dug out; that hills are worn down, and 
lakes filled by the sediment; that waterfalls are formed 
by certain natural or artificial obstructions. The 
ordinary map terms applied to streams in common geog- 
raphy should be learned. 
As before statéd, the inanimate side of geography is 
not as interesting to children as the living. A technical 
study of such things as drainage conditions, erosion, 
transportation, etc., would be a rather bare picture to 
the child. The human and the scenic or esthetic side 
need to be emphasized to complete the picture. 
There is a peculiar fascination in running water. 
Children and grown people feel its spell. The pictur- 
esque setting of most natural streams; the variable mo- 
tion of the water; the different sounds of ripples, falls, 
and clinking pebbles; the distinct unity of character, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  
  56 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
individuality ; its coming from “ somewhere” and going 
“ somewhere’? catch the fancy. It is a curious and 
significant fact that streams are described in terms of 
human life, —a stream has a head and a mouth. It 
can run and fall. Streams pay each other tribute, or rob 
each other of their watersheds. A brook laughs. A 
stream even typifies the career of human life. From 
time immemorial streams have been associated with 
the life of man. No wonder they have a peculiar in- 
fluence and interest. Poets and painters have always 
found their, muses by the banks of running water. A 
little of this sort of thing should pervade the lesson on 
the brook in home geography. 
After the notion of what a stream is has been developed, 
and the ordinary map terms used in connection with it 
have been taught, then the brook should be given its 
natural setting “in the country ” or “in the mountains.” 
Let the pupils relate their vacation experiences with 
brooks, and have them tell what they like about it. 
Show numerous pictures of brooks in various moods and 
of different types. The study should not be limited to 
the water and bed merely, but the banks, valleys, and 
surrounding scenery; the rocks and cliffs; the trees, 
flowers, and ferns; the birds and other animal life asso- 
ciated with the stream should all be connected with the 
brook to make a unity such as the brook usually presents. 
Its relations to human life should by all means be
-P-A-G-E-69
HOME APHY TO ILLUSTRATE METHOD 57 
brought out: the uses of the stream as a water supply for 
man, or a drinking place for cattle, for fishing, boating, 
water power, and its scenic value. Before leaving the 
subject, the stream should be enlarged to the dimensions 
of a river, and further uses suggested, such as navigation, 
irrigation, etc. The reverse of the picture, the flooding 
and destruction of land and other property, and the 
necessity of fording, ferrying, or bridging, should be 
shown. 
These relations to life should not merely be summarized 
as a conclusion to the lesson, but should be dwelt on in 
a study of concrete, local examples, and developed from 
the study of pictures and through supplementary reading. 
Considering the vast importance of streams as geograph- 
ical factors, such study is by no means excessive. 
Weather study. — There certainly is no excuse for 
not studying this observationally. The weather cannot 
be escaped. It is everywhere. The purpose of weather 
study in the nature work of the primary grades is chiefly 
zsthetic, and should remain partly so in the upper grades. 
But there the informational side predominates. There 
should be enough study to appreciate the esthetic ele- 
ments of even bad weather, to be familiar with various 
weather phenomena, and to know their relations well 
enough to judge when to carry an umbrella, or when it is a 
good day for the wash, and when to make hay. Also, 
the purpose is to teach some general principles of weather 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
58 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
and climate so necessary for the understanding of the 
biological conditions in different parts of the globe. 
In home geography weather vane, thermometer, rain 
gauge, and calendar should be taught through use. 
The simpler weather phenomena, heat, cold, rain, snow, 
wind, clouds, and the changing seasons, are suitable 
topics, and these should be taught by observation out- 
doors and by indoor experiments. The work must, 
however, be kept simple. 
It is customary to make weather calendars or weather 
charts. These are useful in showing how such records are 
made, and in stimulating observation of weather and 
the use of weather instruments. This study should not 
be carried on too long. Very often these tables are 
a waste of time, dull and unprofitable. It is a mistake 
in the elementary school to make records throughout 
a whole term. A few weeks of consecutive observation 
will serve the purpose. To continue it invites lack of 
interest. The beginning of winter, the coldest period, 
windy March, and showery April are the most interest- 
ing times for weather study. 
Through the simple weather study of home geography 
should be taught certain generalizations as to the 
association of temperature, wind direction, and the state 
of the sky, as indicative of different kinds of weather. 
The south wind is hot and muggy. The east wind and 
overcast sky mean rain. The indications for each

locality should thus be learned. A little can be taught 
about the work of the Weather Bureau, and pupils 
may be encouraged to look up the forecasts as shown in 
the daily press, and to become familiar with the local 
signals of flags and whistles. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
CHAPTER VII 
ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL 
Geography should-be-concrete. — The more vivid and 
real the subject can be made, the more it appeals to the 
children, and the better it is understood. To children of 
the-plains, mountains are hard to realize without models 
and pictures. And the unlimited view of the plains 
is just as difficult to imagine for children shut up in 
narrow mountain valleys. Geographies tell about locks 
and canals, but few pupils can understand how a ship 
is locked through, without the aid of pictures. The 
cotton gin is rightly given an important place in com- 
mercial geography. But how many children know just 
why it has to be used, how it is constructed, and how it 
works? Reference is made to a host of natural products, 
manufactured articles, etc., that are mere empty names 
to one who has never seen them. Occupations, customs, 
dress, architecture, interest the child in the study of 
foreign lands, but only in so far as he is able to picture 
them. 
From these examples is seen the necessity of assisting 
the imagination to form concepts of: those facts in geog- 
raphy which cannot be seen and studied at first hand. 
60 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL 61 
To bring before the class adequate and suitable illustra- 
tive material is as much a duty of the teacher as “ read- 
ing up” on the lesson. The amount and character of 
the material for visualizing the lesson may be taken as 
an index of the teacher’s earnestness and ingenuity, and 
even of her appreciation of the subject. 
In the chapters on home geography, the purpose and 
treatment of the field lesson were considered. There 
now remains to be considered the following kinds of 
illustrative material, some of which are actual and some 
only representative : 
Pictures, next to the real thing, stand foremost in 
interest and usefulness. Children are always fond. of 
them, and study them to the least detail. By the modern 
photo-mechanical and color-printing methods results 
of marvelous accuracy and beauty are obtained. Being 
photographic they may generally be considered authentic, 
and are so regarded by children. The half-tones in the 
text corroborate the words of the book. Not only that, 
but they often teach more. \They should, like the text, be 
assigned for study, and should be used in the recitation. 
The teacher, however, should select pictures from othg 
sources to supplement those of the text ; and, better still, 
display larger views that may be placed before the class 
and seen by all at once. European schools are pro- 
vided with large type pictures of races, occupations, 
physiography, and scenery which are immensely useful. 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
But there are no such type pictures made in this country. 
Such as are used are imported. There are, however, 
numerous medium-sized pictures obtainable from 
various sources. Some may be purchased from view 
companies. Many may be gathered from magazines 
and newspapers. Frequently excellent pictures used for 
advertisement may be obtained from commercial houses, 
real estate companies, steamship lines, and railroads. 
The picture post-card fad, also, is a good thing for 
geography. 
The teachershould be onthe lookout for pictures, 
and make a collection. Pupils are usually glad to help. 
This collection should be made useful and available by 
a proper method of classification and filing. They should 
be mounted on stiff paper, and properly labeled. Look- 
ing for a picture in an unsorted collection is like looking 
for a needle in a haystack. Some teachers paste their 
pictures in a scrapbook with reading matter. This plan 
is not so good as keeping them loose and classified in 
pigeon-holes, drawers, or envelopes. 
Study of pictures. — It is not enough to simply display 
@picture to the class. It should be studied and described 
by the pupils, and a lesson should be drawn from it. 
Perhaps the picture is an Eskimo scene: What sort of 
clothing do the people wear? Why? What else in the 
picture shows that it is cold? Are their houses made 
like ours? Of what are they made? Why do you 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  ; L, ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL 63 
hink they use snow? Look at the scenery. Do you 
see trees? Now can you tell why they make houses of 
snow? What else do you notice in the picture? Yes, 
the Eskimo is a good boatman. Notice his boat. 
Would that be made of wood? It is made chiefly of 
skins. Where do these come from? Yes, that is a seal, 
and that apolar bear. What has the man in his hand? 
What is it used for? What uses would he make of the 
animals he kills? Ete. 
In this lesson the picture serves as the basis for the 
development of the facts to be brought out. 
It is a good practice for cultivating observation and 
expression to have the pupil describe a picture at length, 
so far as he is able. 
Children like to listen to a good description of a picture. 
Sometimes the teachersshould do the describing, using 
plenty of descriptive words and phrases, not neglecting 
the scenic or beauty aspects, and remembering the 
children’s natural interests. This description should 
be lively, vivid, and picturesque. It should not be 
merely a passive description of static appearances, 
but should ‘suggest life and activity, and the thoughts 
and emotions naturally aroused in such situations as 
are depicted. 
In some studies a single picture cannot show all that 
is needed. A series should be used, particularly with 
such topics as represent action, development, changes, 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
64 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
processes, — as, physiographic changes, manufacturing 
processes, agricultural processes, etc. 
Blackboard drawings. — In this connection it should 
be urged that teachers use every opportunity to sketch 
on the blackboard as an aid in teaching. Simple outline 
drawings may be made of 
natural earth features; maps 
may be sketched from mem- 
ory; diagrams showing rela- 
tionships, processes, develop- 
ment, etc., may be drawn. 
Even though these pictures, 
maps, and diagrams are in 
the book, there is an advan- 
tage in reproducing them. 
They are a wonderful help 
in creating and holding at- 
tention, and in teaching many 
Fic. 1. Diagram showing opera- 
tion of a canal lock, topics. They should, as a 
rule, be drawn at the moment 
they are referred to, and comments should be made 
upon them by the teacher as she draws them. Colored 
crayons help to differentiate the parts of a drawing. 
Pupils also should be taught to reproduce the simpler 
diagrams, and to make necessary maps on the board. 
Visual memory. — The psychological reason for the 
high teaching value of pictures is that they enable the 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL 65 
eye to convey impressions to the mind, which in simply 
listening or reading must depend on the imagination and 
memory to construct the objects of the scene. The 
picture does this much more quickly, vividly, and ac- 
curately, and, what is very important, a visual memory 
persists with most pupils longer than any other. The 
popularity and educative value of pictures is attested 
by their almost universal use in every kind of book, 
paper, advertising, etc. 
The lantern slide and moving picture are also very 
popular. Where f. es permit, both of these should 
be used in teaching geography. In this way much 
“tarry at home travel”? may be accomplished. Such 
pictures, where the necessary facilities exist, may be 
shown by the regular teachers. School authorities should 
provide for this purpose more liberally than in the past. 
Rooms should be arranged with dark shades, and pro- 
jection lanterns of the simpler types should be installed. 
Many teachers give a personal touch, which pupils gener- 
ally like, by having slides made of their own photographs, 
taken on their travels. Sometimes outsiders, as high 
school teachers, travelers, and lecturers, may be induced 
to give a travel talk with pictures. The travel lectures 
given to the general public by accepted authorities should 
be recommended to the pupils for attendance. These 
lecturers have contributed much toward the popularizing 
of geography. It is the realistic character of the large 
F 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
66 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
pictures on the screen, particularly if colored, that make 
them so valuable. The geography teacher should at- 
tend these lectures to get out of a rut, and to learn not 
only the art of popular exposition, but some very good 
pedagogy. The intensely human treatment of geography 
by the public lecturer will be noticeable. 
Lantern slides may be rented from view companies, 
and often large loan collections are under the control 
of the school authorities. 
The opaque projection lantern is another means of 
adding interest and pleasure to the work. By this, 
without going through the labor and expense of making 
slides, one may take a photograph, postal card, or even 
a picture in a book and project it upon the screen in 
original colors. 
The stereoscope produces the most wonderfully realistic 
effects by combining two pictures of the same object, 
from slightly different angles of view, similar to what 
occurs with binocular vision. This instrument; with sets 
of views, should be found in every school. They are 
inexpensive. The disadvantage of these stereographs is 
that the work with them must be individual, not collect- 
ive, as with the lantern slide. To allow group work, 
schemes have been proposed for providing sets of ten 
or more of each series of views. The plan is too ex- 
pensive and cumbersome. It is better to place the 
stereoscopes and stereographs in the classroom or the 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL 67 
library, where they may be looked at by the children 
individually. Or particular views may be sent singly 
around the class. 
To avoid oral repetition, it is a good plan to write a 
brief description or explanatory remark on an attached 
card, calling attention to the principal points to be noted. 
Stereographs may be obtained at book stores, photo sup- 
ply houses, and view companies. 
Children delight in making collections. — This tend- 
ency should be turned to good account in getting them 
to assist in collecting pictures from all sources. It is 
an excellent plan to let them illustrate geographical 
exercises or notebooks with clippings and pictures. In 
making a book of geographical views, the pictures should 
be classified by topics, — river scenes, mountain scen-* 
ery, cities, buildings, people, products, etc. When a 
foreign country is studied, or any other topic, the pupils 
might make a book of pictures of that topic. It is also 
well to suggest a more systematic arrangement of the 
pupils’ private postal card albums. 
Geographical specimens.—A touch of reality is 
given to the study of a foreign country by having some 
material object from that land. A piece of granite 
from the top of Mt. Washington, a shell from the South 
Sea Islands, a coconut from Brazil, a piece of sugar 
cane from the plantations of Cuba, a Chinese newspaper, 
a Japanese fan, etc., are worth having at the time re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
68 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
lated topics are studied, if only to catch the attention 
and hold the interest. But specimens do far more than 
this. They take the subject matter out of the realm of 
the abstract, stimulate the imagination of the pupils, 
and help them to project themselves in thought to the 
regions whence these objects came. 
Sometimes aspecimen is simply employed incidentally 
for the sake of-interest ; and sometimes it is essential, in 
order to get a true conception of the topic under study. 
When China is being studied, a Chinese teacup, though 
not necessary, adds interest. But a cotton plant 
from the South, when the Southern states are taken up, 
is a real aid to the appreciation of the staple industry of 
that region. And it is practically useless to discuss the 
composition and appearance of granite without the 
rock and its constituent minerals. Here the specimens 
teach the lesson. Geographical specimens may play a 
large or only an incidental part, but they always add 
interest and serve to make the subject tangible. 
A teacher on her travels should collect geographical 
specimens and souvenirs for use in teaching. By a 
little questioning, pupils may be found who have at 
home interesting geographical material, which they would 
be only too glad to lend the teacher for use in class. 
Here, again, advantage may be taken of the children’s 
collecting instinct in the formation of a school collection. 
A geographical collection or cabinet is a useful adjunct. 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL 69 
This may be gathered through the teacher’s and pupils’ 
efforts, and through purchases by the authorities. 
There ought to be a common collection for all the 
classes of a building. Thus the classroom collections 
may be pooled, and a larger stock secured. In fact, as 
material for one is often useful in the other subject, 
the nature and the geography collections should be com- 
bined. (Among suitable articles for such a collection 
are: historic relics (books, papers, weapons, pictures, 
etc.) ; raw materials and different stages of manufactured 
articles (foods, fabrics, metals, etc.); botanical and 
zodlogical specimens or products not perishable in 
nature (grains, fibers, pressed plants, ivory, horn, 
mother of pearl, starfish, etc.); rocks and minerals, to 
illustrate physiography. 
Such a collection should be classified and labeled. 
The labels should state the name of specimen, where 
obtained, and by whom given. The collection should be 
kept in neat order, and clean. If possible it should be 
placed so that pupils could observe it in their leisure 
hours. Finally it should be used. 
Geographical experiments. — An experiment is a ques- 
tion addressed to nature. In an experiment things are 
put under certain conditions “ to see what will happen.” 
There is need and opportunity for experimentation in 
geography, especially in physical geography. Some- 
times it is inconvenient or impossible to observe certain 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
70 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
phenomena or relationships in the field, or to wait for 
their natural occurrence. Then, often, they may be 
artificially reproduced in the classroom. 
The process of rock disintegration and soil formation 
may be nicely represented by rubbing two stones to- 
gether and grinding off particles. The porosity of stone 
and absorption of water may be shown by immersing 
a brick or a piece of sandstone in a jar of water. The 
solvent action of natural waters may be suggested by 
the effect of acid on marble. The action of run- 
ning water may be illustrated in a sand tray. The 
study of the convection of air (winds), the evapora- 
tion and condensation of vapor, and the pressure of 
the atmosphere can only be made clear by simple experi- 
ments in physics. 
Some of the industrial processes can be elegantly dem- 
onstrated in their simplicity by classroom experiments. 
Flour making, cotton ginning and spinning, tanning, 
dyeing, weaving, making pottery, etc., may be thus 
shown. Agriculture, irrigation, and some of the prin- 
ciples of forestry may be represented in the school garden. 
In mathematical geography experimental possibilities 
are indicated by the shadow stick, the noon altitude 
of the sun, and the compass. 
The experimental method is excellent to develop the 
questioning attitude on the part of the children. They 
are too prone to accept the dogmatic statements of 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL val 
teachers and books. The experiment shows them that 
they can find out something independently. 
When experiments are used to discover facts and prin- 
ciples, the reasoning is inductive. Often, however, the 
experiment is used to prove the word of the teacher or 
the book, in which case the deductive method is used. 
Geographical concepts increased by illustrative ma- 
terial. —In conclusion, the teacher has, in pictures, 
specimens, experiments, and field observations, an 
invaluable aid in geographical instruction for rendering 
it realistic, vivid, and entertaining, and for making it 
more concrete and more easily understood. At the same 
time pupils get the benefit of personal observation and 
inference, and learn to depend not wholly upon the 
teacher and the text. This illustrative material may be 
used as effectively in the upper grades as in the lower. 
The stock of concrete geographical concepts may be 
continuously increased thereby, and a surer foundation 
laid for that portion of the subject which cannot be 
actually seen. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
CHAPTER VIII 
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 
Definition. — That portion of geography dealing more 
particularly with the forms of land and water andthe 
states of the atmosphere, with the natural forces acting 
upon them, and with the relation of plant and animal 
life (including human) to their environment, is called 
Physical Geography. The emphasis in this phase of 
geography is usually on the inanimate side, and Man 
receives a rather brief consideration. 
The natural environment of man must ever be of con- 
cern to him. It is that which sustains him, and largely 
determines his occupations and habits of life. A proper 
understanding of physical geography is, therefore, the 
best foundation for the appreciation of political. 
The greatest advance in geography as a science in re- 
cent times has been in this field. The older geographers 
confined themselves to a static description of the earth ; 
that is, to locative and scenic descriptions of physical 
features, especially coasts, rivers, and mountains. But 
since the development of the sciences of geology, mineral- 
ogy, and biology, physical geography has become 
72 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 73 
dynamic; that is, the earth is no longer treated as per- 
manent and unchanging, but as constantly subject to 
various modifying forces. The evolutionary or develop- 
mental conception of the earth has been grasped, and 
mountains, valleys, rivers, etc., are no longer treated as 
everlasting, and unchanging in form and character. 
These features are now considered as having a growth 
or development. The forces or agencies that made 
them are now taken into account. Mountain folds are 
thrown up by the stress of forces within the crust. 
But they are subject to erosion and decline. Rivers 
tend to grade toward sea level. Lakes fill up and dis- 
appear. In short, the earth is no longer considered as 
an inactive, inert thing, but pulsating with mighty 
forces, alive, as it were. 
Modern physical geography teaches far-reaching 
relations; for example, topography and drainage, alti- 
tude and temperature, mountain trend and rainfall, 
climate and vegetation, and the dependence of man 
upon his physicalenvironment. In order to teach geog- 
raphy well the teacher should know at least the rudi- 
ments of these great principles. This branch of geog- 
raphy is considered so important that many schools 
for the training of teachers make it a requirement in the 
course. 
Place of physical geography in the elementary school. 
— Geography, so far as the elementary school is con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
cerned, is a study of how man lives on the earth..~ This 
involves a study of those features that influence or con- 
trol his distribution over the earth, his occupations, 
and very civilization. Descriptive geography should 
be taught in the light of this fact. This may seem too 
philosophical by far when we consider children’s interests 
and mental ability; but it is not necessary to force the 
pupils to see these great relations all at once or all to- 
gether. Certainly very little toward this can be accom- 
plished in primary geography or home geography, and 
even in the eighth grade, pupils are incapable of grasping 
the whole truth. The teacher, however, should know 
these principles, and teach the subject in the light of 
them, and should try to have the pupil ultimately appre- 
ciate something of them. The facts of geography should 
be presented in their natural relationships. Beginners 
will for the most part note merely the facts, and not 
their relationships. But older pupils care also for the 
abstract relations and principles involved, and these 
from repeated examples will gradually dawn upon them. 
One thing must be remembered, physical geography 
by itself has no place in the grades (except possibly in 
the uppermost). It may be properly taught as a separate 
science in the high school, but in the grades below, what- 
ever physical geography is taught should be connected 
with the political side. 
The “advanced” geographies of the upper grades 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 75 
usually begin with an introductory sketch of the funda- 
mental physiographic facts and principles, which are 
then deductively applied in the following descriptive 
geography. 
In the grammar grades the pupils gradually formulate 
the relations of man and nature, and get a philosophic 
glimpse of the organization and unity of the science 
impossible in grades below. Here pupils are old enough 
to appreciate somewhat the causal relation existing 
between location, surface, elevation, drainage, climate, 
vegetation and animal life, and human beings. The 
physical features may be used to develop or interpret 
human industries, mode of life, dress, and other human 
activities and characteristics. See Chapter XI. 
The Great Plains. — An excellent example of the value 
of physical, as an explanatory basis for descriptive geog- 
raphy, is the study of the Great Plains of the United 
States. 
Topography and climate. — The Great Plains are a 
high, fairly level plateau extending north and south 
through the United States, just east of the Rocky Moun- 
tains. They slope gently toward the Mississippi Valley. 
Their vast extent and levelness gives them their name. 
The United States lie in the belt of prevailing west- 
erlies, which bring moisture from the Pacific Ocean. 
Owing, however, to successive mountain systems, which 
begin at the very coast, and rise higher and higher 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
76 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
farther inland, the moisture of the westerlies is condensed 
as the winds rise over the mountains, so that by the time 
they pass the Rockies they contain comparatively little 
moisture. As the winds descend on the eastern side of 
the Rockies they become warmed by compression and by 
the warmer temperatures of the lower altitudes, their 
moisture capacity is increased, and they become drying 
winds instead of rain-bringing. 
The precipitation on the Great Plains is therefore very 
slight, from ten to twenty inches per year. There are 
long periods of drought, especially in the summer. The 
climate is semiarid. 
The consequence is that the vegetation of this region 
is limited to such species as are able to withstand the 
excessive dryness of the soil and atmosphere. Sage 
brush covers large areas of the plains, especially in the 
north. Farther south, in the warmer belt, cacti of 
various kinds flourish. Only along the streams can trees 
exist. Even the grass is not able to produce a continuous 
sward, but grows in tufts here and there, and hence is 
called bunch grass. This grass, owing to the dryness of 
the air after the middle of the summer, dries up quickly 
and retains its nutritious quality. That is, it becomes 
cured into natural hay, which the light snows of winter do 
not completely cover. 
Ranching industry. — This peculiarity of the climate 
and vegetation have made possible the great cattle or 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 77 
grazing industry of the Plains. Upon these immense - 
stretches, where in days past the bisons and antelopes 
roamed in vast numbers, thousands upon thousands 
of cattle, sheep, and goats find a fair pasturage. But 
owing to the sparseness of the grass, these grazing grounds, 
or ranches, must be large. This makes the homes of 
the settlers far apart, and the region is thinly settled. 
Farming, as it is carried on in moister lands, cannot be 
practiced here on account of the aridity. The United 
States Department of Agriculture has introduced drought- 
resisting plants from other countries, such as alfalfa, 
macaroni wheat, millet, etc., and has tried to develop 
native wild species, the cactus, for example, into more 
useful forms. Such crops can be grown by the dry- 
farming method, and much progress has been made in 
the West in their cultivation. Another method of farm- 
ing in this dry land is by means of irrigation. By this 
method water is drawn from rivers into canals and dis- 
tributed over the fields. Thus the water supply is sure, 
and many kinds of crops can be raised. Irrigation from 
rivers in this way can be carried on only in their valleys. 
By means of dry farming and irrigation many more 
people are enabled to live on the Great Plains than by 
ranching alone, and many towns have developed in the 
more agricultural sections. Still, the general aspect 
of the Plains is that of a semidesert. The treeless, 
grassy lands stretch away monotonously to the horizon. 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
78 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
The ranchers live a seminomadic life, as they drive their 
herds about for new pasturage. There are farming 
communities and towns in only the more favorable loca- 
tions, oases along the water courses. 
Physical geography, in home and primary geography, 
requires a different treatment. Here the physical 
features are first studied to familiarize the child with 
the local environment. Owing to the immaturity of 
the pupils, the relation between causes and consequences 
cannot be very thoroughly studied. The work should 
be chiefly descriptive of the static aspect of land, water, 
and the atmosphere, leaving for higher grades the 
origins and results of natural forms and conditions. 
Here and there the more obvious of these relations may 
be studied. Thus it is customary in primary geog- 
raphy to study a little about the origin of soil, the 
effects of running water, and the causes of wind and 
rain. 
Specific, concrete, and human interest. — The ap- 
proach and general treatment of the physical features in 
home geography should be from the human standpoint, 
even from the child’s, and the study should again find 
an application in life. For example, in studying a 
brook, begin with the child’s experiences with a brook 
(perhaps only a street gutter during a shower). The 
childish play has taught definite ideas of the motion of 
the water, its force, ripples, waves, eddies, rapids, falls, 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 79 
the melodies of running water, the beauty of light and 
shade. The sport of playing at ships, bridges, dams, 
water wheels, etc., is basal for appreciating later the 
commercial utilization of streams. The study must not 
stop with the physical treatment merely, but should be 
brought into relation with man again in the study of 
the practical uses to which streams are put, and also 
by reference to their detrimental qualities. 
In the physiographic description, care should be taken 
to use untechnical language, and to make the reasoning 
about causes or results very simple and practical. The 
local flavor should be retained. Instead of learning 
about brooks in general, some local stream should be 
taken specifically. The study should be observational, 
based upon actual field observations, well-remembered 
facts, classroom experiments, diagrams, models, and 
pictures. 
It‘is best in home geography to teach physical geog- 
raphy in connection with-some—concrete example, as 
incidental to a description of the same, than to present 
it in the abstract. Thus erosion may be studied in 
connection with The —— Brook of the neighborhood. 
Weathering should be studied in connection with local 
soils in the school garden or near-by fields. It is better 
to study the facts of physical geography as they are 
needed. Let them be used in explanation of the politi- 
cal and industrial features of the vicinity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
80 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Physical geography explanatory of life conditions. — In 
the Primary Course of Descriptive or General Geography 
physical geography should be subordinate. The human 
or life side, national occupations and characteristics, 
is the main thing. Instead of introducing a study of a 
country with topography, climate, rivers, etc., in syste- 
matic order, it is better to start with some trait of the 
people, some historical association, some occupation, a 
description of the plants or animals. The scenic aspect, 
though physiographic, depends upon the subjective 
impressions of the beholder, and is an interesting ap- 
proach at times. The introduction to a country might 
vary. In Australia the curious animal life, in England the 
historical connections with the United States, in the 
Southern states the cotton industry, in Japan the silk 
industry, in Switzerland and Scotland the scenery, might 
be the first topics. 
The physical geography should come in as explanatory 
of the political, and should be brought in only for this 
purpose, or else is better left out. Just enough physical 
geography should be brought in to answer the few Whys 
the pupils will be likely to ask at this stage. Why the 
climate is as it is (latitude, altitude), why the streams 
take the course they do (topography), why the people 
live mostly in certain regions and not in others (topog- 
raphy, climate, resources), why certain plant and 
animal industries are possible in certain regions (topog- 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 81 
raphy, climate, soil), why cities were located at certain 
places and have developed (ports, falls, resources), and 
similar queries. 
Study of Holland according to this method. — Holland 
is a favorite country with children. Why? It is not 
the delta of the Rhine, but the Dutch people, that 
appeals. Reference to stories about the Dutch, Hans 
Brinker, etc. Study interesting costumes. In New 
York City there would be a special interest in the Half 
Moon, the early settlement, and the Dutch gabled houses 
still existing. Study of pictures of Dutch village scenes, 
canals, and windmills. Some Dutch industry, such 
as pottery, etc. The Dutch dairy industry. Why good 
pasturage (level land, sufficient rainfall). Why the land 
is so flat (delta). Why easy to dig canals. The peat 
industry. Why the land is marshy (low). Compare 
with local tidal flats and marshes. Building of dikes 
to keep back the sea. Why the windmills. Why called 
Netherlands, etc. 
The scenic phase of physical geography is important. — 
A knowledge of the physical geography of the scenic 
elements in the local landscape, or of the scenery in 
travel, adds greatly to an appreciation and enjoyment 
of the same. The older pupils can get a deeper insight 
into the earth, but younger children enjoy the super- 
ficial elements. In home geography they should be 
taught to look for and enjoy the sky in calm and in 
Ga

storm, at night and in the morning; the wind ef- 
fects of drifting clouds, swaying trees, and _billow- 
ing grass or grain fields; the enchantment created 
by mists, haze, or distance; the colors of the landscape, 
and how they change with varying lights; the horizon 
line of the plain, or the hill country; the boldness of the 
hills, and the dreamy vastness of the plains; the beauty 
of the lakes and the grandeur of the ocean; the life 
and action of running water; these and many other 
elements of scenery should be appreciated. If physical 
geography did not add something to the pupils’ power 
to discover and enjoy these things, it would scarcely 
have fulfilled its function. 
Teachers should learn to describe in vivid word paint- 
ings different types of scenery to impress them upon the 
pupils, who should cultivate the power to image them 
again behind the words of the text, or the symbols of 
the map. 
Pictures are a great aid in presenting the esthetic 
aspect of geography. Some of them should be displayed 
for days, and the larger and finer ones permanently, if 
possible. 
The teacher will find enjoyment and inspiration in this 
phase of geography by reading such authors as Scott, 
Irving, Bayard Taylor, Sir John Lubbock, John Muir, 
Burroughs, Russell, S. E. White, J. C. Van Dyke, and 
other writers on scenery.

CHAPTER Ix 
ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL IN PHYSIOGRAPHY 
That physical geography should be studied directly, 
if practicable, goes without saying. Certain topics, 
such as weathering, the action of running water, weather 
phenomena, earth and water forms, glacial soil and 
glaciation, the adaptation of vegetation to the environ- 
ment, should be studied outdoors. Preyious outdoor 
observations and experiences of the children should be 
recalled. Many natural objects, such as minerals, dif- 
ferent kinds of rocks, ores, and various physical phe- 
nomena, such as the action of frost, water, and friction 
in wearing down rocks; erosion and deposit, evapora- 
tion and condensation, convection of air, etc., should be 
shown in the classroom as specimens or experiments. 
The function of the field lesson was discussed on page 
34, and illustrative lessons suggested. The field lesson 
is particularly valuable in physical geography, not only 
rendering the subject concrete, but providing the oppor- 
tunity of studying the earth features on the imposin 
scale of nature. Book study cannot impress size, 
tance, and magnificence like field study. The duration 
83 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
84 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
and fatigue of one walk will impress distance better than 
the use of the map scale and verbal description. The 
grandeur and beauty of the local environment can only 
be fully appreciated and enjoyed by actually experienc- 
ing it. 
Physical geography of home locality. — It is fortunate 
that physical geography thus requires the study of the 
real thing. In this way the home geography of the lower 
grades is continued. The local features have to be taken 
as examples in these field trips, and thus physical geog- 
raphy is brought home, and not left in the abstract. 
This local study of physiography is made very practical 
by connecting the familiar landmarks of hills, valleys, 
streams, etc., with the local history, the industries, and 
the life of the community. 
Sooner or later, however, inaccessible regions must be 
taught, and some representative illustration has to be 
employed. 
The model. — The most effective of these is the model. 
This, for certain purposes, is more valuable than a map 
or a picture, in that it isin three dimensions, and the up 
and down, the high and low character of the surface, can 
be represented. Models should be used very early. 
Let the children reproduce the hills and valleys of their 
home geography. The home locality may be modeled 
by the teacher and the pupils, a very interesting .piece 
of creative imagination. By such local studies the 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL IN PHYSIOGRAPHY 85 
pupils become familiarized with the interpretation of 
models in general. 
Relation to map study. — Models are generally used 
as the basis for the study of the continents. They are 
excellent for showing the great plains, plateaus, and 
slopes, and for developing the drainage. The eye mem- 
ory is greatly helped by the construction of even a very 
crude sand model of a continent. The model should 
precede the map, and helps to interpret it. 
Accuracy. — Models are most accurate in elevation 
and general detail when representing small areas. The 
larger the area modeled, the more do the minor elements 
in the relief disappear. A mountain five miles high, if 
correctly represented on a globe four feet in diameter, 
would be hardly noticeable, being only about one 
thirtieth of an inch above the general spherical surface. 
In order, therefore, to represent large areas, like con- 
tinents, in appreciable relief, it is absolutely necessary 
to exaggerate the same. In some of the best relief 
models of the United States the elevations are magnified 
~ ten times. 
There is no very great harm done if younger pupils 
have an exaggerated notion of relief as drawn from 
models, or even from their own imagination. Older 
pupils should have these incorrect notions modified. 
The teacher, of course, must know the error in the 
model. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
86 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Expert and homemade models. — There are excellent 
and instructive models on the market, but most of them 
are as yet too expensive for the common school. Such 
models may sometimes be made available for children 
by visiting geographical laboratories in high schools or 
museums. 
For ordinary purposes, however, a homemade model 
will serve very well. This may be made by the pupils, 
or if something better and more permanent is desired, 
by the teacher. 
Sand model. — The best material for a temporary 
model is moist sand. The clay-modeling trays, com- 
mon in elementary schools, may be used for holding the 
sand. Shallow tins, or oilcloth, or heavy paper, to pro- 
tect the desks, may be used. Any clean sand will do. 
Dry sand usually slides and rolls too easily, and must 
be slightly moistened, but should not be wet and soggy. 
Place a double handful of sand on each pupil’s tray. 
Modeling a continent. — Write the directions below 
on the board, or, for younger children, give orally and 
let them imitate step by step the teacher’s modeling. 
See that they follow the order : 
i. Flatten out the sand to a thin layer, about an eighth 
of an inch thick or less, all over the tray. Put the excess 
of sand in one corner. 
2. From a wall map or textbook map of simplified 
form, trace the outline of the map to be drawn in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL IN PHYSI 2APHY 87 
sand. With a stiff piece of paper remove the excess of 
sand. 
3. Copying the model or interpreting the physical 
map, next build up the plateaus, ot the mountains, 
using care to keep the various plateaus roughly in propor- 
tion as to area and altitude (follow color scale). The 
plateaus may be quickly built up by dropping double 
handfuls of sand along their general location, and then 
smoothing down gradually with the hand. Plateaus, 
plains, and slopes are the main features to represent in a 
model, hence care should be used in their representation. 
4. (If time permits, or it is deemed desirable.) Put 
on the principal mountain ranges. This is best done by 
gently scraping a little of the plateau between the fore- 
fingers into a slight ridge. Be careful not to make the 
mountains too steep or too high, a common tendency 
with beginners. The usual practice of making moun- 
tains by sticking on dabs of sand held between the 
thumb and fingers is sure to make them too high, jagged, 
and steep. Few mountains have a slope exceeding 
thirty degrees. 
5. The rivers and lakes may be traced with the pencil, 
but should not be dug down through the sand to sea level. 
Bits of blue yarn and pieces of blue paper may be inserted 
for the rivers and lakes to heighten the effect. 
Such modeling is a useful exercise in review. Older 
pupils might reproduce a model from memory as a test 
   
-P-A-G-E-100
88 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
of their knowledge of general topography. General 
relations of height, not accuracy of outline, should be 
the criterion. 
It is not worth while for the pupils to model every 
continent. Enough should be done to give them a mus- 
cular and ocular appreciation of what relief is, that they 
may interpret more readily relief and physical maps. 
Sketch models.— The teacher, however, should 
model maps more frequently. These generally need 
not be more than mere sand sketches thrown together in 
a few moments, while she is teaching the topography. 
The children enjoy the manual exercise of modeling 
for its own sake, and welcome it as arelief from the routine 
of book work, but it may easily be overdone. Where 
there is sufficient time, a few more permanent models 
may be made of better material. The following plastic 
media have been found useful : 
Paper pulp: Tear old newspapers into bits and soak 
in water fora day. Stir and churn till reduced to a pulp. 
Squeeze out the water, and it is ready for use. 
Salt and flour: A mixture of these, two measures of 
flour to one of salt, is stirred together with enough water 
to make a paste. 
Plasticine, used for art work, though somewhat ex- 
pensive, is an excellent medium. 
Putty makes good, durable models. 
These materials should be used on stiff cardboard, 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL IN PHYSIOGRAPHY 89 
or on wood asa base. They often last for years and serve 
very well for demonstration purposes. A good size 
for class use is about eighteen by twenty-four inches. 
A rim or frame should be. made around the model to 
protect it from injury. 
Modeling according to scale. — A more scientific yet 
simple method, which the teacher might employ for 
making a permanent model, is the following : 
From a contour map, or from published tables of ele- 
vations determined in public surveys, the heights of 
many points all over the map may be obtained. Draw 
the map on a board. Determine on some arbitrary 
scale, say, one tenth of an inch to a thousand feet. 
Drive wire brads or small nails into the map, at the 
places the elevations of which have been determined, 
leaving the nails exposed to a height equaling, ac- 
cording to the scale, the elevations to be represented. 
Then carefully work in the plastic material flush with 
the nails. The surface will need retouching, grooving, 
and peaking to render it more realistic. When dry, 
the model should be given several coats of paint, and 
streams, lakes, boundaries, etc., represented in ap- 
propriate colors. 
Physical maps far exceed models in general usefulness 
and convenience. Models are effective for topographic 
features, but are not of much use if they represent a 
large area on a small scale, and if large, they are too 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
90 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
heavy. Maps are light and compact. In the causal 
study of geography of the upper grades, physical maps 
are the foundation for the study of the descriptive 
geography. 
Photo-relief map. — One form of physical map is the 
photo-relief map, made theoretically by photographing 
a relief model placed so as to show one-sided illumination 
of the mountains, thus causing them to stand out 
bright on one side, dark on the other. They are usually 
represented in half-tone. A common way is to paint a 
relief map in black and white so as to get the photographic 
effect. Such relief maps are almost like a picture of 
the naked earth seen in bird’s-eye view, shorn of the 
vegetation and the works of man. The half-tone color 
also strikingly brings out the bare earth effect, so that 
they are excellent maps for teaching the fundamental 
relief features of the earth. They are often used to show 
drainage also. 
The color-physical map represents relief by different 
colors, a particular color for a certain range of elevation: 
from o to 500 feet, green; 500 to 1500 feet, yellow; etc. 
In modern methods of cartography some beautiful 
color-physical maps are produced. Unfortunately, all 
makers do not use the same color scheme, though there 
is a movement toward international agreement. Chil- 
dren should be taught to refer to the legend or explana- 
tion on the map, and to estimate elevations thereby.

  92 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
At any rate they should appreciate the general meaning 
of the color scale, and be able: to pick out at a glance 
the highlands or the lowlands. 
Contour map. — The chief objection to the color- 
physical map is that the colors are not shaded or blended 
to correspond with the gradual change of clevation. 
This is overcome in a measure by the use of the contour 
map, in which, beginning at sea level, all points of 
certain equal altitudes are connected by lines. Thus 
atation of relief by contour lines. 
there may be the roo-foot level line, the 200-foot line, 
etc. Such lines are called contour lines. The explana- 
tion on the map states the value of the contours, varying 
according to the purpose, 10, 100, 1000 feet, etc. By 
contour lines the relief can be very accurately represented. 
Where the lines crowd together, there is a steep slope; 
but where they are far apart, the ascent is gentle. Ra- 
vines, valleys, ridges, and peaks stand out beautifully 
on a contour map. urmaps are the highest per-
-P-A-G-E-105
ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL IN PHYSIOGRAPHY 93 
fection in the art of relief_representation. Yet they 
are rather complex in appearance, and somewhat difficult 
to translate, and therefore hardly in place in the elemen- 
tary school. In the seventh and eighth grades pupils 
should be taught. that-such-maps-exist,.and should be 
interested in their use, and learn how to read them; 
but no general use need be made of them. Most ele- 
mentary school books do not contain such maps; yet the 
dividing line between two different adjacent colors on a 
color-physical map is a true contour line. 
There is a combination of color-physical maps with the 
contour map, which is a beautiful and excellent form, 
used chiefly in some government surveys of this and 
other countries. 
Features besides those of relief may also be shown 
by the physical map. — On the same map are generally 
found the surrounding waters (sometimes showing 
depths), lakes and rivers, latitude and longitude. Also 
divides, isotherms, ocean currents, winds, and vegetation 
limits are sometimes shown. It is customary, however, 
to show most of these on special physical maps for the 
study of only oneora few related features. Thus we have 
rainfall maps, temperature maps, wind and current maps, 
maps showing zones of life, etc. In this way overcrow 
ing is avoided. But a short time ago one and the same 
map combined all the physical and political features.

Profiles are not used sufficiently in the elementary 
school. Teachers will find in them a valuable aid in 
teaching relief. Pupils should be taught to interpret 
profiles, and likewise to draw them. The pupil who can 
make a fair profile of the United States in various lati- 
tudes shows that he knows well the relief map or model. 
Profiles are the quickest way of sketching the general 
relations of relief. They are excellent for showing the 
direction of slopes, for grades of railroads, canals, and 
drainage levels (as the Great Lakes). Naturally they 
are exaggerated vertically, but, with the necessary 
caution, are not misleading. 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
CHAPTER X 
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 
Overemphasis of mathematical geography. — The 
reason for the great stress usually laid on mathematical 
geography does not lie in the pedagogical usefulness of 
this branch in the elementary school, but rather in its 
history and in its relation to astronomy in the higher 
schools. 
In ancient times geography and astronomy were 
not separated. Geography was a part of astronomy. 
Mathematics was employed in the service of astronomy 
in determining the space relations of the earth, its 
movements, and its form. In the Middle Ages geog- 
raphy had fallen so low that it was taught as a part of 
geometry. This mathematical emphasis prevailed to 
the beginning of the nineteenth century, and, unfor- 
tunately, has not quite disappeared at the present 
time. 
Mathematical geography too abstract for the beginner. 
—So far as the elementary school is concerned, very 
little mathematical geography is needed for a basis. 
It is unpedagogical to begin the study of geography 
with the astronomical or mathematical phase. This 
96 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 97 
may be the logical beginning of the science of geography, 
but the child, not the logical requirements of the subject, 
must be considered. It is destructive of any real 
interest, and is forcing a child beyond his capacity, 
to compel him to begin geography with what is abstract 
and to him far from his experience. The space rela- 
tions of the earth, conceptions of its size, conceptions of 
its motions, are, on the whole, beyond his comprehen- 
sion. Latitude and longitude and degrees are to the 
beginner unintelligible, because, for one thing, he has 
not had the necessary arithmetic. 
It is futile to teach these things to beginners, and 
judging by the very meager results from much effort, it 
is often futile to teach them in upper grades. Children 
readily learn to parrot off the usual bald statements 
about mathematical geography in the ordinary texts, 
but do not really understand them. 
Child study has accomplished one excellent thing, the 
reduction of the amount of mathematical geography 
to be taught, and its postponement for a time. The 
child now begins with something concrete, tangible, 
and capable of direct observation; that is, with home 
geography, and not with something abstract, imaginary, 
“unreal,” and difficult. This does not mean that 
the simple, observational study of the sun, moon, and 
stars may not be taken up even in primary grades, 
under nature-study. But the abstract and mathemati- 
H 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
98 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
cal treatment of form, space relations, time relations, 
and motions are not for beginners. 
When to introduce mathematical geography. — A 
time arrives when some reference must be made to the 
earth as a whole. Even in home geography there is 
mention of places beyond the horizon of the community, 
of countries beyond the seas, and of the uttermost parts of 
the earth. The idea of the world as a whole dawns upon 
the child, and he then needs some information about it. 
At this point mathematical geography usually begins. 
The essential facts in mathematical geography in the 
primary course are the spherical form of the earth, some 
concrete notions of its size, the poles and the equator 
for orientation, the points of the compass, rotation and 
its results, revolution and its results. Zones are usually 
included, but in these grades heat belts are really meant 
by this term. If the dimensions of the earth, distance 
from the sun, axis, astronomical zones, latitude and 
longitude, meridians and parallels, and the study of the 
seasons based upon the inclination of the axis were not 
taught until the seventh year, nothing would be lost to 
the pupil. 
Little of this is subject to direct observation. — Day 
and night, and the phenomena of the seasons, the 
appearance of the sun, moon, and stars, and a little of 
their change of position in the heavens, are all that can 
be observed directly by the pupils. The rest must 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 99 
be taught dogmatically, and backed up by argument, or 
“ proof,” that appeals to young minds. 
The rotundity of the earth, for example, is really a 
fascinating topic, owing largely to the dramatic history 
of Columbus and Magellan. Their voyages make an 
excellent introduction to the study. Children by the 
seashore, or by the Great Lakes, have the opportunity 
others do not have, of observing the “ proof ”’ of rotund- 
ity in the gradual disappearance of a ship sailing out- 
ward, the mast being the last to disappear over “ the 
shoulder of the earth.” Elsewhere the children must be 
satisfied with models (globes), and the “‘ proof ” is still 
further weakened by being only an argument by analogy. 
The best proof of rotundity capable of being grasped 
by beginners is that of the shadow of the earth on the 
moon during an eclipse of the latter. It is first necessary, 
however, to explain the phenomenon of an eclipse. 
Of the many arguments for the rotundity of the earth 
some are only analogies, and some are incomplete proofs. 
Conceptions of dimensions of the earth. — To say 
that the earth is eight thousand miles in diameter, and 
twenty-five thousand miles in circumference, is meaning- 
less to a child. These numbers may be memorized, but 
are not really conceived, nor are they of great use till 
much later in the course. But if they must be taught, 
it is far better to let a child figure out some concrete 
example, such as how long it would take a train to go 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
100 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
around the equator at a certain speed, say, fifty miles per 
hour ; or tell how long sailing vessels or modern steamers 
(average rate, fifteen miles per hour) require for an actual 
circumnavigation. Tell about Jules Verne’s Around 
the World in Eighty Days, and more modern records. 
In this way some sort of a concrete notion of the earth’s 
greatness will be given. 
The poles and the equator are to a beginner chiefly 
climatic in meaning, and should be mainly taught by a 
description of the temperature and life conditions there. 
The locative notion can only be derived by analogy from 
globe study. Spin a ball or orange. The point in which 
the spinning sphere turns is a pole ; and directly opposite 
is another. The idea of equator is readily grasped, as 
an equal divider. 
The term axis is really of no use in primary geography, 
and when introduced here serves only to confuse. The 
usual way of teaching the idea of axis is to compare it 
with an axle, which leaves a bad picture in the eye 
memory, hard to eradicate and to correct. An un- 
pivoted ball, orange, or other round object, set spinning, 
will much better teach the abstract character of the axis. 
Latitude, longitude, parallels, meridians, and prime 
meridian are out of place in primary geography. An 
examination of two of the most recent and foremost 
textbooks of primary geography revealed that one does 
not teach the terms at all,and that the otherdefines them, 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 101 
but makes no application of them in the text. The map 
studies and map descriptions in neither refer to latitude 
or longitude, and yet all the maps, except a few relief and 
sketch maps, show these lines. They would be simpler 
without them. 
~~~Pay and night. — The effects of one-sided illumination 
and rotation may be nicely shown by means of a globe 
experiment. The books generally recommend a dark- 
ened room and a lamp for the experiment. This is 
usually impossible, or out of the question. Excellent 
results may be had by drawing all the ordinary shades 
but one, and this also partially, thus preventing cross- 
illumination. A black globe is very effective. 
In spite of a general acquiescence in the principle, the 
pupils will find it difficult to imagine the earth actually 
in rotation, and are rarely conscious of its direction. A 
good way to realize this is to watch the sun near the 
horizon at sunrise or at sunset, and then “ forcibly ” 
to make one’s self think of the earth as doing the moving. 
The sensation of rotation is thus quite marked. 
In the study of the change of seasons pupils should 
note the varying phenomena of changing length of day, 
the changing temperature, the response of vegetation 
and animal life, and how man’s life is regulated by these 
conditions. This side, rather than the mathematical 
or astronomical, should be impressed. 
During early spring or early fall some observations 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
may be made with the shadow-stick on the height of the 
noon sun from week to week. (It does not pay to do it 
daily.) From this it may be shown that the sun is 
higher or lower on successive dates, and this should be 
correlated with the changing temperature. A further 
Fic. 5.—Shadow-stick and protractor. 
causal study involving the inclination of the axis and 
revolution is out of place in primary geography. 
Heat belts vs. zones. — The customary picture of 
the earth divided into five zones is an easy one to re- 
member, and as heat belts, fairly correct for beginners. 
Zones are, however, strictly speaking, not heat belts at 
all, but light belts, or astronomical divisions. The true 
heat belts are much more irregular, and are not constant 
in position on the earth, while the light zones are fixed. 
Zones are determined by the position on the earth of 
certain light rays from the sun on certain days of the 
year, and by the inclination of the earth’s axis. The 
boundaries of the zones do not vary. But the boundaries 
of heat belts are shifting isotherms of great irregularity, 
owing to the changing seasons and the modifying 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 103 
influences of land and water. The term zone should 
disappear from primary geography and heat belt should 
be substituted. 
The best way to present the idea of heat belts to begin- 
ners is to tell or read stories of the climate, the vegeta- 
tion, the animal life, and the human life of typical 
climatic regions. The reason for the unequal distribution 
of heat, if any be given here, would have to be given 
dogmatically, as by citing the varying height of the sun 
above the horizon as one proceeds from the equator 
to the poles. 
Mathematical geography in upper grades. — Further 
than this in mathematical geography, it is not profitable 
to go with beginners. The pupils of the seventh and 
eighth grades are, however, more interested in, and 
better prepared for this subject. Here the subject is 
usually extended and reviewed. Buteven here too much 
is generally expected. The explanation of the change of 
seasons, based upon the inclination of the axis, and rep- 
resented by diagrams, is beyond the capacity of the 
average child in the eighth grade, and is a severe 
tax upon the high school and college student. Even 
here the result is generally not a concept of the real earth 
swinging along its orbit in space, but simply a mental 
image of the seasons diagram in some book. 
The fact of the varying length of day from the equator 
to the poles should be taught, but the reason therefor is 
too difficult for average pupils. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
The international date line also is beyond their 
capacity. 
The moon’s phases do not belong in geography at all. 
With these eliminations the subject of mathematical 
geography becomes an easy one for both pupils and 
teacher. It has always been a bugbear to teachers 
because of the inward realization that the pupils do 
not really comprehend much of it. 
Observational basis. — Because of its abstract charac- 
ter it is necessary to present the subject by means of 
observations, models, diagrams, and pictures in as con- 
crete a fashion as possible. As above suggested, some 
direct observations on the appearance of the heavenly 
bodies, the daily course of the sun, and the changing 
altitude of the sun during the year are possible. These 
observations should be made some time before a topic is 
to be considered in class. Thus, leading up to a study of 
the seasons, pupils should make a weekly record of the 
noon altitude of the sun for perhaps a month in advance. 
The accompanying changes of temperature, and the 
adaptation of plant and animal life, should also be 
noted. Thus an interesting, solid basis will be laid for 
the more abstract discussion of the seasons. 
The globe is invaluable in the study of mathematical 
geography. A six-inch paper globe serves very well. 
Larger globes are attractive, but more expensive and 
unwieldy. There is a fascination about a good globe, 
\ 
\  
-P-A-G-E-117
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 105 
and it should be left where pupils may examine it at 
leisure. They will discover much for themselves. A 
good globe, however, should not be soiled, or marked with 
pencils. 
A black globe is very useful, especially for teaching day 
and night, and latitude and longitude. Such a one 
may be obtained from school supply establishments, or 
readily made by painting a common globe with a flat 
black paint, or better still with black slating. A wooden 
ball dipped in black ink does very well. 
Expensive mechanical solar models are out of place, 
and also out of the question in the elementary school. 
The relation of the sun and the earth may be well repre- 
sented by holding two globes or balls in the proper 
relation, and moving them in the proper manner. Sucha 
physical representation by models should always pre- 
cede the use of diagrams and abstract descriptions of the 
topic. 
Diagrams in mathematical geography are themselves 
symbolic and represent relations and motions which to 
the child are imaginary. The model must therefore act 
out these relations and motions to interpret the diagram. 
The season diagrams as usually given, if they do not leave 
erroneous impressions, are too difficult for the average 
pupil, unaided by models. Yet diagrams, once under- 
stood, are beautiful representations. They may be 
used to emphasize certain features, or to represent what 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
106 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
the mind, as well as the eye, sees. It is this last charac- 
teristic that makes them especially useful. 
With the caution above given the teacher should be 
free to make much use of diagrams, more in the upper 
grades than in the lower. Diagrams should be drawn 
while the topic is being discussed. They are a sort of | 
graphic shorthand that expresses a good deal. Pupils 
should be taught to explain or interpret diagrams, and 
also to draw them. 
Inductive development before textbook study. — 
These lessons in mathematical geography are perhaps 
the most difficult for pupils to get from a textbook. 
They should therefore be first orally developed or ex- 
plained by the teacher before being assigned in the book. 
They ought to be taught inductively as far as may be; 
that is, the pupil should discover these important re- 
lations, rather than have them presented dogmatically, 
either by the book or by the teacher. Care should 
be exercised that the technical terms have a real meaning 
for the pupil. 
The points in method outlined in this chapter may be 
illustrated by the following lessons. 
Latitude and longitude. — On a black globe make a 
mark (an island). Ask a pupil to tell where it is. 
It will be impossible to locate it except by reference to 
some other known fixed marks. The pupils have 
learned poles and equator. The above mark (island) 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 107 
may be located then with reference to these. But more 
accurate locating is needed. How shall this be done? 
Construct parallels (one every 10 degrees); note 
their relation to the equator, and to each other. Give 
theirnames. What do they help toindicate? (Distance 
from the equator.) Now that the pupils have the con- 
cept, give it a name (latitude). How shall we designate 
or distinguish the parallels? Here review the necessary 
arithmetic, that is, circular measure. Draw a circle 
around the globe through the poles. How many degrees 
in it? How many degrees from pole to pole? From 
equator to pole? How far is the first drawn parallel 
from the equator? (10 degrees.) Etc. Now how may 
we distinguish the parallels? (By stating the number of 
degrees each is from the equator.) 
Show how parallels may be drawn in both N. and S. 
latitude ; how both sets are numbered from the equator. 
What is the latitude of the equator ? 
Where is the island drawn at beginning of lesson? 
Locate it by latitude. Can it be definitely located now? 
Why not? (It may be anywhere in the parallel.) Refer 
to the way in which we locate houses in a city by giving 
street and cross street, and suggest advisability of having 
another set of guide lines than parallels to help locate 
on the globe. Such lines may be drawn. The circle 
already drawn through the poles is such a one. Now 
proceed in a similar way to draw, say at every 15 degrees, 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
108 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
other lines (meridians) from pole to pole, to number in 
degrees, from one selected (principal) meridian. Com- 
pare with numbering of parallels. Briefly explain why 
the meridian of Greenwich (London) was chosen. What 
do the meridians help to show? After the concept of 
longitude is attained, give its name. Now locate the 
sought-for island by longitude ; by longitude and latitude. 
Now, for clinching, compare the two sets of lines. In 
what direction do they run? How far? Their distance 
from each other? What does each indicate? What is 
the greatest latitude? Greatest longitude? 
Then apply in simple exercises in locating places on a 
globe. 
Pass on to a map. Discover. the two sets of lines. 
Show pupils how to estimate between the lines. Practice 
use. 
Show how the parallels and meridians are further used 
as state or international boundaries; as the basis for the 
United States Land Survey, and even for laying out 
the streets and lots of a city; how used as the basis for 
making a record of discoveries and making maps of these 
records. Such facts will impress on the pupils the reality 
and usefulness of these lines. 
Are these lines visible on the surface of the land or the 
sea? How, then, does the mariner know his latitude and 
longitude? Emphasize the fact that the schoolroom is 
traversed by parallels and meridians. Can they be 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 109 
seen? They cannot be seen on the earth, but by look- 
ing at the sky. 
Give a simple explanation of how latitude may be 
found from the altitude of the NorthStar. (Seeany text 
in mathematical geography or astronomy.) Pupils in 
the eighth grade can get a notion of this. They may 
find the latitude from the sun at the equinox. 
The explanation of how longitude is found will have 
to be deferred till after the lesson on Longitude and Time. 
Fifth grade lesson on the seasons. — This is most 
appropriately studied at the turning of the year, in 
spring or autumn. 
The lesson should be begun a month beforehand 
by the pupils making preliminary observations on the 
sun’s altitude at noon with shadow-stick (Fig. 5), its 
horizon position, the length of day and night (obtainable 
also from almanacs), correlated with weather study (tem- 
perature changes), and observations on the responses by 
nature to the changing seasonal conditions. Figure 5 
shows a simple form of shadow-stick. Place in a south 
exposure at noon with vertical stick, S, toward the sun. 
S will then cast a shadow along the base, B, which may 
be measured on the scale. The angle of the rays, R, 
with the horizontal may be measured by placing the 
center of the protractor, P, at the end of the shadow and 
drawing the string over the top of the stick, S. The 
angle may then be read on the scale of the protractor, 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
110 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Refer to present season. Name all. Let pupils 
characterize each as to temperature, length of day and 
night, the state of vegetation (budding, full leaf, 
flowering, fruiting, harvest stage, leaf coloring, leaf fall), 
the response by animals (migration, hibernation, thick- 
ness of plumage or fur, storing of food, building homes). 
How does man adjust his life to the changing seasons in 
the city? What games are played in different seasons? 
How does the farmer in the country vary his work during 
the year? The close relationship of life to the seasons 
will be emphasized by these references. Pictures will 
greatly add to the interest. 
What is the source of the heat on the earth? Prove 
heating power of sunlight by holding hand first in sun- 
beam, then in shade. Why do we take the shady side of 
street in summer? Why carry parasols? 
Compare temperature at night, morning, noon, 
evening, and connect with position of the sun and

the slant (angle) of the rays as they fall on the earth. 
Use the diagrams (Fig. 6) to explain heating value of 
sun’s rays. In the diagram on the left two sunbeams 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 111 
of equal size (cross section) are represented, one falling 
on the surface, HC, at a smaller angle than the other. 
There is the same amount of light and heat in both, but 
the more nearly vertical beam covers less surface, AC, 
than the other. The light is thus more concentrated, 
intense, and the heating effect greater than on EF. 
In the diagram on the right, the same thing is shown 
in another way. AC is a surface on which eleven rays 
fall at right angles. If this surface is now turned into 
the position AC’, so that the light falls at a small angle, 
only six of these rays strike it. The amount of light or 
heat received by AC’ is thus only 8; that received in 
position AC. This diagram gives a more mathematical 
demonstration than the other, and is easily compre- 
hended by the children. 
When is the heating effect of rays the greatest? 
(When striking perpendicularly.) How does the heating 
effect of the rays vary with the slant? Now make 
application to the variation of temperature during a day 
and connect with altitude of sun above horizon during 
the day. Consider next the shadow-stick data. These 
show that the shadow at noon is getting shorter in 
spring (longer in autumn). Why is it getting shorter? 
(Because sun is higher in the heavens.) How does the 
angle of the noon rays compare with the angle several 
weeks ago? (It is greater in spring.) 
Connect with the preceding about relative heating 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
112 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
effects of rays more and less slanting. Why isit warmer. 
in May than in April? (Because the rays are more 
vertical.) 
Briefly explain revolution, using models. Do not 
refer to axis. Tell of duration of journey around the 
orbit. Refer to the four seasons. Give the first day of 
each season. How far apart are the successive dates? 
Place the earth (globe) in these relative positions. Also 
represent in diagram. Explain that as the earth goes 
about its orbit the slant of the sun’s rays varies from 
season to season. ‘The reason for this (position of axis) 
should not be given in this grade, as it is too difficult. 
Another reason for the variation of temperature, 
which children of this grade can appreciate, is the chang- 
ing length of day and night. How would the heating 
effect of the sun when shining only 10 hours in Decem- 
ber compare with the effect shining nearly 15 hours in 
June? 
Correlate with reading of stories of the calendar, and 
the naming of the months. 
Eighth grade lesson on seasons.—It is customary to 
assign this topic in the textbook. This is pernicious, as 
the pupil will in this way very probably get no true con- 
cepts of the terms employed, nor of the problem as a 
whole. The topic should be presented in class, illus- 
trated concretely with models, experiments, and dia- 
grams, and developed or explained step by step by the 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  
  MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 113 
teacher. After this it may be safely assigned for drill 
in the textbook. 
The new terms, revolution, orbit, ellipse, plane of 
orbit, axis, direction and parallelism of axis, should all 
be made clear and concrete before attempting the ex- 
planation of the seasons. Introduce with a sketch of 
the relation of the earth to the sun. By concrete 
comparisons give some notion of the immense distance 
to the sun. By use of model first, then diagram, show 
the manner of revolution, andthe path, the 7 The 
usual picture of a very long, narrow ellipse for the‘earth’s 
orbit with the sun at the center is misleading. As a 
matter of fact, the orbit is so slightly elliptical that its 
difference from a circle is not very noticeable. The 
sun is not at the exact center, but eccentric, yet so 
slightly that it need not be referred to. Children are 
apt to use this eccentricity of the sun as a reason for the 
seasons. So it had better be omitted. Try to get 
the pupils to picture the plane of the orbit. 
The next point to teach is the inclination of the axis. 
Visualize this by means of rulers placed on the table 
(used as plane of orbit). While the inclination is re- 
ferred ultimately to the plane of the orbit, it is really 
measured by the angle between the axis and a perpen- 
dicular to the plane of the orbit. Next refer to the north- 
ern end of the axis always pointing approximately to 
the North Star (how find this?) during a revolution, 
I 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
114 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
with the consequent parallelism of the axis to all its 
positions. This may be illustrated by means of rulers 
properly held, also by revolving the earth about a sta- 
tionary object (sun), but care must be taken by the 
teacher to keep the axis in correct position; a diagram 
may also be used to show this. The discussion of the 
lesson proper may now proceed. The demonstration 
should be presented from that side of the room which 
will place the axis of the globe in its correct position 
(pointing toward North Star), and yet give the class a 
view of the inclination of the axis, or else the globe may be 
frankly placed so as to give this last view, and the North 
Star may be imagined directly in line with the axis. Have 
some object for thesun. Place first in either summer or 
winter position. Compare northern and southern hemi- 
spheres. Do they face the sun equally? Which is turned 
away? (Say the northern.) Place in the northern sum- 
mer position. How is-the northern hemisphere placed 
now with reference to the sun? (Turned toward.) In 
which of these two positions does it get more light and 
heat? What season would this be? What season for 
the northern hemisphere in the other position? Place the 
globe in the autumn or spring position. Note that the 
northern hemisphere is turned neither toward nor away 
from the sun. What would be the conditions of light 
and heat in this position? (Intermediate.) What 
season might it be? If passing from winter to sum- 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 115 
mer? Drill on seasons for this hemisphere all around 
- the orbit. 
Next compare the southern hemisphere with the north- 
ern in relation tothe sun. How do the seasons compare? 
When the northern hemisphere has summer, the southern 
hemisphere has ———? Why? Etc. When we ‘in the 
northern hemisphere have spring, the southern hemi- 
sphere has——— ? When we have June, the south- 
ern hemisphere has ——? (June also.) We celebrate 
Christmas in December. When do the people in the 
southern hemisphere celebrate it? (Same month and 
day.) 
Another reasoning is based upon the distribution of 
the vertical rays of the sun. With a device holding a 
number of knitting needles parallel, to represent the 
sun’s rays covering half the globe, the slant of the rays 
in the two hemispheres may be made clear. Refer to 
the fifth grade lesson in seasons and review relative 
heating capacity of more slanting and less slanting rays. 
(Fig. 6.) Note in the northern summer position where 
the rays fall most vertically; least so. Conclude as to 
seasons here. Note even distribution of light.in the 
spring and autumn positions. 
After the models have been used to teach the above, 
diagrams may be used. The teacher should be sure 
the pupils understand them and the point of view from 
which each represents the earth and orbit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  116 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
The diagram (Fig. 7) is the best for the eighth grade. 
Though distances and size are necessarily out of propor- 
tion, the general relations are correct. The orbit is 
shown, as should be, practically a circle. The sun is 
slightly eccentric, nearer to the earth in northern winter.

It is better to represent the sun by the word Sun, or by 
S, than to draw a circle for it, as it would be too much 
out of proportion with the earth. 
The diagram shows the earth, etc., in a bird’s-eye view,

MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 
great distance. The northern hemisphere is here shown. 
The inclination is represented by the eccentricity of the 
pole and parallel circles, they being shifted in each posi- 
tion of the earth toward the right in the diagram ; that is, 
the axis must be imagined pointing to the North Star. 
This diagram is particularly good to show the tilting 
of the northern hemisphere toward the sun in June, and 
away from it in December, and the non-tilted position 
in March and September. 
It is also excellent to show the illumination of the 
northern hemisphere. It shows the unequal division of 
each parallel circle by the circle of illumination (line 
between night and day) in summer and winter; the equal 
division in spring and autumn. From this can be seen 
why daylight is longer in summer, shorter in winter; 
and why days and nights are equal in spring and autumn. 
Furthermore, the diagram is good to show the condi- 
tions of illumination in the polar region in the different 
seasons. By means of it the polar night and day can 
be explained. The relation of the Arctic Circle to the 
sun can thus be brought out. 
The diagram (Fig. 8) shows the earth as viewed from 
an immense distance, from a place in the plane of the 
earth’s orbit, that is, directly from the side. It is par- 
ticularly good to show inclination of axis, the tilting of 
the hemispheres toward or away from the sun, the 
parallelism of sun’s rays, the angles at which they strike

118 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
the earth, the illumination of the polar regions, and the 
contrast of the two hemispheres. It is easy to draw. 
It shows well the relation of the tangent ray to the Arctic 
Circle, and of the vertical ray to the Tropic of Cancer

and Tropic of Capricorn. Its disadvantage is that it 
cannot be used to show the light relations in spring or 
autumn. 
The diagram (Fig. 9) is often used, but is apt to be 
misleading unless the point of view is explained, and

MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY 119 
unless it is used after the two preceding diagrams. It 
represents the earth and sun as seen from a point in 
space off to one side of the orbit, and a little above it. 
It shows the orbit therefore in foreshortened perspective 
as an ellipse. Pupils should be warned on this point 
not to picture the orbit thus, but rather as a circle. 
With these cautions the diagram may be used, though 
it does not really contribute any more or as much as the 
other two. As usually shown in the books, like the 
diagram, the spring and autumn positions are repre- 
sented, and the illumination of both poles at the same 
time is indicated. (The perspective is, however, violated 
here.) 
With such explanation of the diagrams, after or in 
connection with the demonstration with the models, 
they become somewhat intelligible to the pupil, though 
it is a question whether the average eighth-grade pupil 
ever thoroughly grasps them. But they are found in 
the books, and some attempt should be made to render 
them meaningful. 
The teacher should practice these diagrams with care 
so as to be able to reproduce them with fair accuracy. 
Notre. — The subject of zones, polar night and day, 
length of day in different latitudes, etc., should be left 
out of the lesson on seasons, and taught in a following 
lesson, if necessary.

CHAPTER XI 
THE CAUSAL RELATION 
Comparison of the old and the new geography. —- 
Modern geography is more than a mere catalogue of 
facts; it is also a study of the relationship of these facts, 
which to the maturer mind. makes the subject so in- 
’? answers the teresting. The old ‘‘sailor’s geography’ 
questions What? and Where? the modern geography, 
also the question Why? The first two questions call 
for the exercise of the memory chiefly; the last, for the 
exercise of the reason also. 
Causal relation in geography. — The great principle 
underlying the science of geography is that of the Causal 
Relation, also variously called the Principle of Cause and 
Effect, Geographical Sequence, Geographical Conse- 
quence, and Geographical Control or Influence. 
This modern phase of geography has been brought 
about by the application of the scientific method. This 
was made possible by the marvelous development of 
geology, meteorology, biology, anthropology, and sociol- 
ogy during the last century. The study of earth forces, 
earth structure, and life conditions and interrelations 
has applied far-reachingly to the explanation of geo- 
120 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
THE CAUSAL RELATION 121 
graphic facts, such as the origin of surface features, 
scenery, climate, distribution of vegetation and animal 
life, and the characteristic adaptations of man to dif- 
ferent regions. 
The cause, origin, or explanation of geographic facts is 
a chief feature of the modern science of geography. 
The principle of origin, growth, development, modifi- 
cation, —in short, the Principle of Evolution, —has been 
applied to geography. The dynamic character of the 
earth and its life have been recognized. 
Geographical consequence. — Not only are the causes 
or the origins of things looked for in geography to-day, 
but the mind is also directed forward to the results or 
consequences. Every present fact is, in a measure, the 
cause of some consequent fact, as well as being itself the 
effect of some preceding. The new geography traces 
this chain of cause and effect as far as may be. The ob- 
servation of previous causes operating to produce 
certain results, leads us to predict of the future what 
has been true of the past. Thus we may anticipate. 
The explanatory principle unifies geography.— It is this 
explaining of geographical events and features, and this 
anticipation of future developments, that renders modern 
scientific geography so fascinating. From a mass of 
chopped-up, inchoate facts, geography is transformed 
into an organic whole by this unifying principle. In- 
stead of requiring the memory to retain a mass of un- 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
    
122 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
related facts and incidents, the principle of causal rela- 
tion stimulates the reason to seek out the relationship of 
these facts, and to reduce them to some common prin- 
ciples, to simpler terms, or to classify them in categories 
more easily kept in mind. 
The human significance of geographical relations. — 
Geography is distinguished from physiography and 
geology by the emphasis of the human element. To be 
sure, the extra-human part of geography is also studied, 
but this is only with regard to its importance in explain- 
ing or understanding the relations of human life to the 
earth. This puts a different aspect upon the relation- 
ships of geography. River action has its geological con- 
sequences, but in geography the question is, What is 
the significance of these consequences to man? Moun- 
tains are the result of crushing, folding, and uplift, due 
to the contractional forces within the earth. But this 
statement has, strictly, no place in geography, unless 
employed to bring out some feature of human life, 
as, for example, that mining is made possible by the re- 
sulting exposure of the strata; that mountains are ob- 
stacles to travel and intercourse; etc. 
Geographic influence. — This peculiar geographical 
aspect of the principle of the causal relation is commonly 
called the Principle of Geographic Control, or Geograp 
cal Influence, referring to the bearing of geographical 
conditions upon human life. In other words, the features 
   
-P-A-G-E-135
THE CAUSAL RELATION 123 
and forces of the environment are studied in relation 
to man’s life. The same thing is expressed from the 
human standpoint by speaking of the adaptation of man 
to his environment. In modern geography, then, the 
environment is studied that the lives of the people may 
be understood. A national costume, a national occupa- 
ti racial stature, and even a racial, spiritual trait 
may find an explanation as the direct or indirect influence 
of the environment, or as the adaptation of man to the 
natural conditions of his habitat. 
Examples of geographic influence. — The following 
few examples of this close causal relationship between 
man and nature may illustrate the foregoing : 
Rivers, since man began, have played an important 
part in the history of his civilization. In ancient times, 
as to-day, rivers were used as the seat of human settle- 
ments. The mere physical necessity of water to drink 
would keep man near the streams. Streams erode 
valleys and deposit flood-plains, both of which are useful 
toman. Valleys are the easiest routes of travel because 
of the gentle natural grade. Even to-day the railroads 
follow the river valleys. Flood-plains, being level, make 
communication easy. 
The rivers abound in fish, and the valleys in game, 
which to primitive man or early settlers are the main 
subsistence. When agriculture began and animals 
were domesticated, the alluvial plains along the streams 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
124 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
became still more useful to man. Through agriculture 
and animal husbandry many more people could live 
on the same area than before, and hence dense popula- 
tions sprang up in the valleys of great rivers, as, for ex- 
ample, the ancient civilizations of the Euphrates and 
Tigris valleys. And to-day the Nile Valley, the Valley 
of the Yangtse Kiang, and of the Mississippi teem with 
people. Centers of trade or cities developed here and 
there, especially along the rivers. 
Gradually manufacturing developed, fostered in some 
cases directly by the streams, as in the higher regions 
where water power was available. 
The riparian races learned early the art of navigation 
as a result of their familiarity with the water. This 
was the beginning of river commerce. The commercial 
development of a nation depends much upon the number 
and the length of its navigable rivers. This was formerly 
more the case than it is in this age of railroads. Rivers 
are the natural arteries of trade, domestic and foreign. 
Rivers, being more or less impassable, have long been 
used as political boundaries, and in this way have had 
much to do with the segregation of peoples. Segrega- 
tion tends to conservatism in occupations, customs, 
dress, etc. 
On the spiritual side it may be said that rivers have by 
their beauty, majesty, and mystery been the inspiration 
of painters, poets, and composers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
THE CAUSAL RELATION 125 
The topography, or the lay of the land, also very much 
influences the life of man. Travel and intercommunica- 
tion are easier on the level than in the broken surface 
of a mountainous region. If the map of any country 
be examined, it will be noticed that the cities and towns 
are scarcest in the plateau and mountain sections, and 
densest in the great plains and river valleys. A map 
showing the density of population makes this still more 
apparent. A railroad map, likewise, clearly shows 
how the routes of travel avoid the rough country. Ina 
broken country towns and individual settlers tend to 
live apart, sociability being attended with too much 
tedious travel. The result is conservatism, a backward 
and backwoods type of civilization, out of step with 
the progress of the plains people. This simplicity 
or backwardness of civilization is seen in many places, 
the plateau of Mexico, the mountains of Spain, the 
plateau of Thibet, the Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee, 
the Highlands of Scotland, etc. 
On account of the diversity of topography in a land 
or different lands, there arises a differentiation of indus- 
tries, and a division of labor. The industries of the plains 
are agriculture, herding on a large scale, manufacture, 
and commerce. The chief mountain industries are 
lumbering, grazing on a smaller scale, mining, and quarry- 
ing. 
Nations of the plains are more open to attack and 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  
  126 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
pillage from their neighbors. This either leads to sub- 
jection, or to the strengthening of their military power. 
Large nations are eventually built up by conquest and 
fusion. In a mountainous region there is more of a 
tendency for a country to remain apart and independent. 
It is easier to defend a mountainous country from in- 
vasion. Hence we find interesting examples of small, in- 
dependent countries surrounded by powerful neighbors, 
as Switzerland, Montenegro, and Andorra in Europe. 
Russia and the United States are examples of nations 
that have spread largely by annexing foreign territory. 
Climate.—Some of the most far-reaching consequences 
are due to climate. If the world had but one climate, 
and one kind of weather, it would be very monotonous 
indeed, in plant and animal life, in the occupations and 
customs of man, in his dress, and probably in his very 
color and physique. 
1. Sun, source of heat.—To trace the study in 
proper sequence, it is necessary to begin with the sun, 
whose rays of light are converted into heat as they strike 
theearth. These rays strike the equatorial regions more 
squarely, the polar parts more glancingly, the result 
being a gradation of temperature from the torrid equator 
to the frigid poles. The situation is complicated by 
the inclination of the earth on its axis, with consequent 
seasonal variations as the earth revolves around the sun. 
2. Winds. — The unequal heating of the atmosphere 
~ 
   
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE CAUSAL RELATION 127 
by the sun is the primary cause of winds. The water of 
the earth is evaporated by this same heat, only to be 
condensed in the cooler altitudes into clouds, and these 
are drifted about by the winds. In general, the winds 
blow prevailingly in a definite direction in a given latitude, 
their direction being primarily determined by convection 
and modified by the rotation of the earth. 
3. The rainfall of a region depends upon the temper- 
ature and the prevailing winds. These climatic factors 
are much modified by the changes of the seasons, by the 
distribution of land and water, by local disturbances in 
barometric pressure, etc., but nevertheless there is a 
definite, though complex, relation between them. 
4. The topography ofa country affects its climate, 
for as the elevation increases, the temperature decreases. 
Also the trend of the highlands is an important factor in 
modifying the temperature, but especially affecting the 
distribution of the rainfall. The moisture of the at- 
mosphere condenses on the windward side of mountains, 
leaving the other side more or less arid. 
5. Climate and vegetation. — The temperature, 
wind, and moisture conditions being thus very complex 
and widely different in various parts of the world, the dis- 
tribution of vegetation, which depends upon these factors, 
will be varied. Thus we have the tundra vegetation 
of the polar lands, the conifer belt next, then deciduous 
hardwoods, and finally tropical vegetation. Tem- 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
perature is the chief factor in this distribution from north 
to south. The factor of moisture affects this still more. 
The rainfall of polar regions is least, that of the tropics 
the greatest. The luxuriance of tropic vegetation is 
largely due to the moisture in the soil and the air. 
6. Inthe United Statesthedistributionofrain 
isunequal. This country liesin the region affected by 
the prevailing westerly winds. Owing to the north and 
south trend of the highlands in the west, the moisture 
is greatest near the Pacific Coast, on the windward 
side of the Coast Range and the still higher Sierras 
and Cascades. Descending on the other side of these 
last-named ranges, the winds are drying, producing as a 
consequence the arid conditions in the Great Basin. 
Only on the tops of the Wasatch and other high Basin 
Mountains does a little rain fall in this otherwise rainless 
region. Again farther east on the still higher and 
colder Rockies some more of the latent moisture of the 
westerlies is condensed. But the winds continuing east- 
ward fall on the eastern side of the Rockies, and here 
again are drying, because they are warming up, and they 
render the Great Plains semiarid. Thus the western 
half of the United States is divided into a number of 
north and south belts of varying rainfall. 
7. Variety of vegetation in the United States. 
— These variations in the United States of temperature 
from north to south, and of rainfall from east to west, have 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
THE CAUSAL RELATION 129 
brought about a great variation in vegetation. On the 
mountains near the Pacific are the densest and tallest 
of forests, with conifers flourishing more toward the north, 
native hardwoods toward the south, and introduced 
citrous trees. In the somewhat drier valleys of Wash- 
ington and Oregon thrive the hardy fruits, hops, and 
grains; and in a similar valley in central California, 
grains, grapes, and semitropical fruits. In the desert 
of the Basin, toward the north, the sage brush abounds, 
while farther south the cacti are typical. Where 
little rain falls on the tops of the Wasatch Mountains 
there is a fringe of forest growth, and on the Rockies are 
extensive, though somewhat open, forests of conifers 
and hardwoods. Then come the Great Plains with their 
semidesert vegetation described on page 75. 
The eastern half of the United States is more variable 
in climate, and the differences in temperature from 
north to south are more marked. The resultant vegeta- 
tion differences are well indicated by the staple agri- 
cultural crops, —the small grains (rye, barley, oats, and 
wheat), hay, flax, and potatoes in the north, next the 
famous corn belt, then the tobacco belt, and then the 
subtropical cotton, rice, and sugar cane along the Gulf, 
where also flourish the orange tree and palm. 
8. Climatic distribution of animals.—The ani- 
mal life is affected directly by temperature and moisture 
conditions, aad by the character of the vegetation. For 
KE 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
130 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
the sake of brevity, suffice it to call attention to the dis- 
tribution of the fur-bearing animals and domesticated 
sheep in the north; cattle, horses, and swine farther 
south; and to recall the study of the grazing industry 
of the Great Plains, page 75. 
9. Manin relation to climate. — Thus far in this 
causal study only the non-human side has been referred to. 
The whole purpose of the study thus far was to lay a 
foundation for the following study of the adaptation of 
man to the varying conditions imposed upon him by 
the differences of climate. 
Climate is probably the most important geographic 
“control” that affects man. He is directly affected by 
the weather and climate, and seeks to shelter himself 
from the elements. While primitive races go naked in 
the tropics, in colder regions they clothe themselves 
in furs and fibrous fabrics. Possibly the very com- 
plexion of man is the result of climatic conditions, for 
in the warmer latitudes the world around the races 
of man are more swarthy. 
(a) Shelter.—The severities of the climate cause man 
to seek a shelter, be it the protection of a tree, a cave, 
a skin tent, a dugout, an igloo of snow, or a house of logs, 
boards, brick, or stone. 
Man must adapt his ways of life to the passing seasons. 
He “makes hay while the sun shines,” and lays up astore 
for the winter. He is thus forced to be provident. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
THE CAUSAL RELATION 131 
(6) Wind.—Of the winds man makes direct use in 
sailing, windmills, etc. Formerly, before the days of 
the steamship, routes of marine commerce were de- 
termined by the prevailing winds. Winds have to be 
taken into account in the blowing of dust in the streets, 
in the encroachment of sand dunes, the drifting snow 
in winter, in disastrous storms and hurricanes. They 
are beneficial to man in bringing rain from the sea, 
and in tempering the heat and the cold by circulation. 
(c) Migration.— Man may modify his circumstances 
somewhat, or perhaps he can adapt himself better to 
conditions. Thus races may migrate to a more congenial 
climate, and individuals travel from one region to 
another to escape the severities of climate. Southern 
California, Florida, Bermuda, and the Riviera are 
favorite winter resorts; while Alaska, the Wilds of 
Canada, the Maine Woods, and Norway are sought for 
cooler summers. 
Altitude has a minor effect on temperature, yet it is 
important. In all lands the mountains are sought 
during the heat of summer. The plateaus of Central 
Mexico, Ecuador, India, and Africa, even in tropical 
latitudes, are endurable, though the ameliorating effect 
may in part be due to the lesser humidity of the air. 
The trend of the Alps cuts off the cold winds from the 
north of Europe, and renders Cisalpine Italy delightful 
by contrast. The Himalayas act in a similar way. 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
132 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
(d) Weather.—The daily climate, that is, the 
weather, is of concern to everybody, affecting the routine 
of work, and the planning for pleasure. So important is 
a foreknowledge of the weather that the government 
spends millions of dollars annually in the study of the 
weather for daily forecasting. 
(e) Rain, life conditions, industries. — Man 
may endure the heat of the equator, and the extremes of 
arctic cold, but water he must have, water to drink, 
water for his cattle and his crops, water for power pur- 
poses and for navigation. Therefore he avoids the 
deserts. In general, the map showing the distribution 
of rainfall would serve to show the density of popula- 
tion. Roughly speaking, the more abundant the rainfall, 
the more people may make a living in a region. More 
migrations have been caused by rainfall conditions than 
on account of temperature. 
The rain is our ultimate drinking supply. Some may 
be caught directly for this purpose, but most of it is ob- 
tained indirectly from the off-flow and from underground 
sources. Locally great engineering works have been 
constructed for the supply of water for cities or com- 
munities. The Romans conducted water thus by means 
of an aqueduct, the ruins of which still stand. Modern 
New York City brings its water from the Catskill High- 
lands, 
But more interesting, from the human standpoint, is 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
THE CAUSAL RELATION 133 
the indirect influence of rainfall through the determina- 
tion of vegetation and animal life, and in this it is usually 
combined with other factors of climate, especially tem- 
perature. Natural vegetation and agricultural crops are 
impossible without water. Different kinds of plants 
require varying amounts of water. Forests require 
at least twenty inches of rain per year, and this mainly 
in the growing season. Where less rain falls, prairies, 
steppes, or deserts prevail. The prairies are covered 
with a continuous growth of sod of grass, aster, golden- 
rod, wild sunflower, etc. The steppes generally have a 
sparse grass growth in tufts here and there interspersed 
with other drought-resistant plants. 
Where there is sufficient rain to maintain forests, the 
forest industries, lumbering, turpentine, rubber, tan bark, 
the furniture and implement industries, prevail. The 
forest regions are usually well suited for animal hus- 
bandry and ordinary agriculture, and so the trees 
are generally cleared away in the course of time to 
permit farming. 
Different agricultural crops require different amounts 
of moisture, and can endure different degrees of drought. 
This, with the varying temperature conditions, chiefly 
determines what kind of crop shall be raised in a locality, 
whether rye, wheat, corn, macaroni wheat, alfalfa, 
tobacco, cotton, rice, sugar cane, coffee, rubber, etc. 
The fact of irrigation emphasizes the controlling 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
134 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
power of water. By irrigation man attempts to modify 
otherwise unfavorable conditions, by artificially supply- 
ing water tohiscrops. In this way considerable arid land 
has been reclaimed and made habitable. 
Animal husbandry, like agriculture, is conditioned 
strictly by climatic conditions. Grazing or herding 
can only be conducted where grass will grow. The 
cattle industry thrives well in agricultural regions, and 
is conducted in a small way by individual farmers 
throughout the world, as in Holland, England, New 
England, in the Central states, etc. But the cattle 
industry on a large scale, with herds of thousands, like- 
wise the great sheep and goat herding, are carried on in 
tegions too dry for ordinary farming, in the semiarid 
steppes of Argentina, Mexico, Spain, Russia, South 
Africa, Australia, and on our own Great Plains. This 
specialization of the agricultural and herding industries 
in different regions was brought about mainly by the 
difference in rainfall. 
The forest, agricultural, and animal industries provide 
many of the raw materials required by the manufacturing 
industry. This is to a great extent independent of 
climatic conditions, and yet is influenced thereby. The 
success of the manufacturing occupations, of course, 
depends upon the production of the raw materials. 
The cotton manufacturer in England watches carefully 
the crop conditions (weather, etc.) of the cotton crop in 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
THE CAUSAL RELATION 135 
the United States. The miller is concerned about the 
success of the wheat crop. 
Some manufactories are located in the heart of the 
regions that produce their raw materials, as flour mills 
in the wheat country, and furniture factories in the hard- 
wood section. However, the ease of modern transporta- 
tion and market opportunities may interfere to keep the 
source of raw material and the factories that use them 
far apart. 
Certain special manufactures require definite climatic 
conditions. The sun-dried bricks of ancient Babylon 
and the adobe of the Zuni require a dry climate to make 
them and to preserve them. In southern California 
there is a long dry season, which is utilized in the open- 
air drying of fruits. The niter industry of South America 
depends upon desert conditions. It is even said that 
the cotton industry of England developed on the western 
side of the Pennine Hills partly because here the greater 
moisture of the atmosphere made the cotton fiber less 
brittle and less liable to break in the process of spinning. 
The salt industry of many parts of the world depends 
upon the possibility of open-air evaporation in a dry 
climate. 
(f) This study of the climatic control may be 
summarized in stating that the world is composed of 
many climes, which tend to create a great variety of indus- 
trial, social, and cultural conditions, a great variety of oc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
136 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
cupations, a grand division of labor, an interdependence 
of region upon region, class upon class, an interchange of 
commodities or commerce, and a mutual helpfulness. 
Abuse of the causal principle. — Useful as this prin- 
ciple of the geographic influence is, it must be employed 
with caution. As a rule, geographic facts are not due to 
one simple cause, but to a combination of causes, the 
influence of each of which may be difficult to judge 
proportionately. Sometimes one factor works favorably, 
while others are adverse. The causal principle may be 
pushed too far. For example, a city may be situated 
on an excellent harbor. It may be far from the truth to 
say that this harbor determined the location of the 
city. The real reason may have been very different, 
and there may be other good harbors or better in the 
vicinity. We may say truly, though, that the excellence 
of the harbor contributed to the commercial development 
of the city. 
The human equation. — Again, in trying to explain 
the human features of geography, the human reason, 
inclination, and even whim may be more important 
factors than the natural conditions. Ignorance and per- 
versity even determine locations of industries or towns. 
The sociological factors governing some of these human. 
institutions are often very far removed from the physical 
environment. 
The establishment of some manufacturing industries 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
THE CAUSAL RELA N 137 
is sometimes seemingly out of place, when the physical 
conditions merely are considered. The saving factor 
is often the human qualities of good management, 
inventiveness, skilled labor, economy in production, 
and even patriotism (supporting native industry). 
Again, there are cities with actually poor location 
which yet thrive. Harbors may be made artificially, 
power may be transported in the form of coal, or trans- 
mitted as electricity, tunnels or bridges may make the 
place accessible, etc. Countries are found where the 
mountainous topography has not been a hindrance, 
apparently, to development, as in the case of Switzer- 
land. Isolation is not always a bad thing. England’s 
insularity was for centuries a guarantee against in- 
vasion and permitted a peaceful development. 
Care must be exercised not to make too sweeping 
generalizations about the influence of the physical en- 
vironment. The case must not be pushed too far. 
Obvious physical influences should be noted, but the 
human factor must not be neglected. It is worth while 
in geography to appreciate the “effect of man on nature.” 
Man makes some changes in his environment, and directs 
the course of nature somewhat along the lines of his 
choice. He is constantly changing the map of the 
world. To be sure, this is mainly a political feature, 
yet the distribution of races is thereby affected. He 
likewise affects the distribution of plants and animals 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
138 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
by the extermination of game, forests, and harmful 
kinds of plants and animals; by the importation of 
foreign species to new regions. The small grains, and 
the domesticated animals, have been carried the world 
over from their original home in Asia, while American 
maize, tobacco, and potato have spread likewise. 
Man’s intellectual adaptation to his environment. — 
Man modifies the topography to a certain extent. He 
grades and levels the land for his cities and roads. He 
tunnels the mountains and rivers. He changes the 
courses of rivers, and makes canals that divide con- 
tinents, constructs irrigation canals, deepens natural 
waterways, builds breakwaters, bridges chasms and 
streams. He modifies the climate by artificially heating 
his houses, and can even prevent light frosts in his or- 
chards by means of smudge fires. Even distance is 
annihilated by the modern methods of communication 
and transportation. 
Yet even in these human efforts the influence of nature 
is seen. The uneven topography necessitated the level- 
ing; the insurmountable mountain had to be tunneled; 
the river barrier required the tunnel or the bridge; the 
narrowness of the isthmus suggested the possibility of 
the canal; the shoals of the river or harbor would not 
have been dredged had the water been deeper, etc. 
The “overcoming of nature” by man is simply another 
adaptation of man to nature, an intellectual or “psychic 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
THE CAUSAL RELATION 139 
adaptation.” Still, for purposes of history and human 
geography it is well to consider this adjustment as an 
achievement of man over his environment. 
The general effect of man’s efforts to modify his 
physical surroundings is concentrated locally, and, 
on the whole, is insignifrcant in comparison with what 
he cannot change. And yet, on the course of human 
affairs, these works of man may have a wonderfully great 
influence. The course of history is made as much by 
man himself as by the physical environment. 
The principle of causal relation in teaching. — The 
discussion and illustration of the causal relation in geog- 
raphy in the preceding pages were intended for the 
benefit of the teacher. It is not intended, by any means, 
to suggest that children should study geography thus 
intensively, for this is beyond their capacity, and outside 
their interest. For children such a treatment may readily 
become too speculative and too difficult. The teacher, 
however, should know these relationships of geography, 
and should present the subject, especially in the upper 
grades, with the whole organic unity of geography in 
mind. The most obvious and simple causal relations 
will appeal to the child, and should be pointed out. 
In the more complex relationships the facts should be 
presented in the causal order, but the pupil need not be 
pressed to work this out. Many such relations will 
gradually dawn on the pupil as other similar cases are 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
140 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
considered, and the geographic consequence of facts 
studied many lessons back may be noticed in a future 
lesson. At any rate, if the subject is properly presented, 
a grammar grade pupil will get a general realization of 
the close dependence of man on nature, and should be 
able to point out specifically some of the more obvious 
geographic influences. 
One method that helps to bring this about is to study 
a country by topics in causal sequence, — location, sur- 
face, climate, drainage, vegetation, animal life, mineral 
resources, industries, human institutions, and history. 
It will help pupils to learn and to remember. It will 
enable them to work out little geographical problems 
that may be set for them. Grammar grade pupils, at 
least, should be conscious of this causal sequence, which 
should be used in map study as well as in the text. 
This logical treatment may become tedious even in 
higher grades. The non-human side is pressed too 
much to the front. Children are especially interested 
in the human aspect of geography. This is especially 
true of beginners. It is not wise, therefore, always to 
begin with physical geography. The discovery of the 
region, its history, the racial characteristics, interesting 
architectural features, national customs, national dress, 
etc., may often be a better starting point for a lesson. 
The point to observe is that the physical and industrial 
geography of a country should be studied sequentially, 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
THE CAUSAL RELATION 141 
and where profitable, reference may be made to other 
causal relationships, such as the effect of the physical 
features on history, or the relation between dress and 
climate, etc. 
The place for the causal study of geography is in the 
upper grades. Still even in the lower easily perceived 
connections should occasionally be remarked, as, Why 
does the Eskimo wear furs? Why does he not make 
his house of wood? Of what advantage is it for a city 
to be on a big river? Ona good harbor? Near a coal 
mine? Why are prairies good for farming? What use 
does a city make of near-by waterfalls? 
Even where the statement of the causal relation is 
not required from the pupils, the facts should be set 
forth connectedly in that relation, as, “ Chicago is 
situated on Lake Michigan, in the center of a great farm- 
ing and manufacturing section, and has 2,200,000 people.” 
“Cotton grows in the moist, warm region about the 
Gulf of Mexico.” ‘‘ On the vast treeless plains are great 
herds of cattle.” ‘The people of the eastern states 
cleared away the forests for farming purposes.” Later 
on the reason will appear.

CHAPTER XII 
POLITICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY 
Political geography. — That phase of geography which 
deals with the division of the earth into nations and 
other political parts, with the races of man, and the 
various activities of human life, including the industrial, 
social, civic, and even educational and religious phases, 
is generally called political geography. This branch 
plays an important part in the elementary school. 
It does not stand by itself alone, however. In the pre- 
ceding chapters the place and value of mathematical 
and physical geography have been considered. It was 
there shown that, in spite of their importance as distinct 
sciences, they were to be subordinated, in the elementary 
school, to political geography, or at least taught in 
connection with it. 
Descriptive geography. — “It is unsatisfactory to 
rend apart geography into separate branches; it then 
becomes dry bones.’ (Mill.) The natural blending of 
the various branches of geography in the depiction of 
the appearance and conditions of a region or country, 
and in the account of the inhabitants, their mode of life, 
142 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
POLITICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY 143 
and their national characteristics, is known as descriptive 
geography. : 
The chief geographical interests of children, young or 
old, as was seen in the chapter on Interests, are human — 
such as racial and national peculiarities, various modes of 
living in different lands, occupations, adaptations of 
man to his environment, the life in cities, etc. Political 
geography presents this phase of the subject, and so 
conforms to the interests of children. The knowledge 
it teaches, of the social environment, is also very practical. 
For these reasons, textbooks in geography for children 
are chiefly political, or rather of the blended descriptive 
type. In this, physical geography is used to picture 
the location, topography, scenery, the climate, and 
resources, and to help understand the human life in 
that setting. The simple observational home geography 
of beginners is really descriptive geography. 
Primary and advanced geography. — Descriptive 
geography for the elementary school is usually divided 
into two courses (sometimes three). The first is called 
primary or elementary geography. This generally be- 
gins with home geography. Then follows an applica- 
tion of its simple principles to a rough sketch of the 
world as a whole, in which the human side is particularly 
emphasized. In this “first round,” except in home 
geography, the treatment should be a rather dogmatic 
presentation of facts. That is, the pupils at the age of 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
144 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
eight to ten are not mature enough to reason out easily 
the relationships of geographical facts, and often would 
not appreciate them if pointed out. So the treatment 
should be chiefly a positive statement of facts put as 
interestingly and vividly as possible, in order that 
the memory may retain them better. Of course simple 
and evident relationships should be worked out, and 
facts regarding distant regions must be interpreted and 
judged in the light of the geographical knowledge gained 
through the direct study of home geography. 
In primary geography all continents and principal 
countries are visited, and the general, great, striking, 
and interesting facts, from the child’s standpoint, are 
considered. Through the study of human life in many 
lands, the essential facts of occupations, manufactures, 
natural resources, climatic conditions, and surface fea- 
tures are concisely treated. Instead of applying the 
causal principle rigidly, it is better generally to work 
back to the causes from their consequences in human 
life. In this way the perspective will present man in 
the foreground, with the physical features as a setting. 
The map work is, of course, to be associated with the 
descriptive text. (See page 172.) 
The essential facts of the subject learned in primary 
geography. — It is important to remember the function 
of primary geography. Aside from details of fact, more 
extended correlation, fuller appreciation of the interrela- 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
POLITICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY 145 
tions of geography, and the generalization of abstract 
principles, the pupil should have at the end of the primary 
course all the essential facts of geography that he will 
have at the end of the advanced course, — the distin- 
guishing characteristics of the nations, their chief prod- 
ucts, the general facts of world topography, and the 
chief locational facts necessary for daily use in life. 
This is accomplished in the primary course by the 
conciseness with which it is taught, by the rather 
dogmatic treatment ; and on account of the readiness of 
pupils in these grades to accept such treatment, and 
the ease with which they retain facts in the memory. 
This period is, therefore, the most suitable for acquiring 
the great mass of locative and distributive facts essential 
in geography. This does not mean a mere cramming by 
rote of the textbook. The main point to remember is 
that at this stage geography answers particularly the 
questions What? and Where? and every means should 
be used to add interest to the work, to awaken thought, 
to fix by means of thoughtful associations, and even 
to work out the more simple causal relations. 
An example from primary geography. — The following, 
taken from a well-known text, is an example of the treat- 
ment of a country in the primary course : 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
TEACHING GEOGRAP 
SWITZERLAND 
Language and government. — Switzerland is the only country 
of Europe, thus far studied, that has no seacoast. Neither has 
it a language of its own. Notice what countries surround it. 
Although it is very small, most of the inhabitants of the southern 
part speak Italian, those in the west, French, and those in the 
north and east, German. The most common language is German. 
This is the only European country that you have studied, 
except one, that is not a monarchy. Its people, living among the 
mountains where they could easily defend themselves, or hide 
from their enemies, declared themselves independent of kings 
hundreds of years ago, and the country has long been a republic. 
Agriculture. —The many lofty mountains seriously interfere 
with agriculture. The Alps extend completely across the country, 
and the Jura Mountains skirt the northwestern boundary. These 
mountains are so rugged that, except in the valleys, few people live 
among them. Between the two mountain districts, however, is 
a narrow plateau, where the surface is much less rugged. It is here 
that most of the people dwell. 
One of the leading farm products is grain, raised mainly on the 
plateau. On the lower lands, especially near the German border, 
there are extensive vineyards. There is excellent pasturage for 
cattle and goats among the mountains, and these animals are 
raised there in great numbers. In spring and summer, as the 
snows melt from the mountain sides, the goats and cattle are 
pastured higher and higher. Such pasture is called an alp, and 
this is the origin of the name of the range, the Alps. 
Lumbering and manufacturing. — Where the slopes are too rugged 
for farming, there is much forest. Therefore, lumber is an impor- 
tant product of the country. 
Although there is no good coal in Switzerland, the Swiss do a 
large amount of manufacturing. Among the principal products 
are wine, butter, and cheese. Wood carving is also an industry 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
POLITICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY 147 
in which many of the Swiss find employment. During the long 
winters, the wood from the mountains is shaped into toys, clocks, 
and other articles. Have you ever seen a Swiss clock ? 
The Swiss have become widely known for their manufacture of 
textile goods, such as lace, linen, silk, and cotton goods. They 
also make much jewelry, especially watches. In some of this 
work water power is used, for an abundance of power is supplied 
by the mountain streams. A great deal of manufacturing, how- 
ever, is done by hand in the homes of the workmen, rather than 
in large factories. From these facts you can readily see that the 
Swiss people must be very skillful, progressive, and well educated. 
Entertainment of tourists. — In the lofty Alps there is some of 
the grandest scenery of the world. Their snow-covered peaks, 
their glaciers descending into the valleys, and the lakes in their 
midst are wonders that many people like to view. Tens of thou- 
sands of people go to Switzerland every summer to enjoy the 
climate and the scenery, and one of the chief occupations of the 
Swiss people is to take care of such visitors. 
Chief cities. —'The capital of the Republic is Berne. Other 
important cities are Ziirich, Basel, and Geneva, three manufactur- 
ing centers. 
The advanced descriptive geography of the sixth, 
seventh, and eighth grades differs from the primary more 
in the point of view and the treatment, than in subject 
matter. The subject is that of the first course studied 
more intensively, in detail, and with the reasons for the 
facts (causal relation) generally considered; history, 
literature, and nature-study are more called upon 
(correlation) to enrich the subject, and to assist in its 
comprehension ; the subject is also studied more formally 
(sequential order of topics); many principles of geog- 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
    
148 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
raphy are developed as a working basis for further study ; 
certain important, typical features are studied in detail 
as a standard of a class (type study) ; more use is made 
of the comparative method of study; and more use is 
made of other sources than the textbook, such as supple- 
mentary readers and reference books. In succeeding 
chapters some of these methods of presentation are 
taken up. 
Some additional mathematical geography is introduced 
which was too difficult for the lower grades, and physical 
geography takes a much larger place in advanced 
courses, being used more in explanation of the political 
features. In fact, in some curricula elementary physical 
geography is introduced more for its own sake, in the 
seventh or eighth grade. Commercial geography is of 
greater interest to pupils of this age, and therefore 
industrial topics receive a larger treatment, and this is 
sometimes enlarged, in the eighth grade, into a separate 
branch. (See Chapter XVIII.) 
Detailed study of a country in advanced geography. — 
The general difference between advanced and primary 
geography may be well seen from a comparison of the 
account of Switzerland, pag? 146, with the following taken 
from an advanced textbook. Note how the interest is 
aroused and held, the sequential order of topics, the 
causal relation, the emphasis of physical and commercial 
features, the comparison with other lands, the interpre- 
     
-P-A-G-E-161
POLITICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY 149 
tation of the human facts by the physical environment, 
the correlation with history. 
The study begins with a statement of the historical 
and the geographical importance of the British Isles and 
then proceeds to explain this position as follows :! 
The prevailing westerly winds also partly account for the great- 
ness of the United Kingdom. Two days out of three these winds 
blow across the British Isles; and, since they have crossed a vast 
expanse of warm water, they greatly temper the climate. Indeed, 
the winter season is milder than that in northern United States, 
and the summer is cooler. 
The prevailing westerlies, bearing an abundance of moisture, 
so distribute it over the islands that no section suffers from 
drought. Yet the western portions receive more rain than the 
eastern, because the damp ocean winds reach them first. 
As already stated, the mountains of Great Britain, like those of 
New England, are so old that they are worn very low. While 
these uplands rarely rise more than one or two thousand feet above 
sea level, there are occasional higher peaks of hard rock. For 
example, the granite peak of Ben Nevis, in Scotland, the highest 
point in the British Isles, is forty-three hundred feet in elevation. 
The Scottish Highlands are so rugged and barren that few people 
are able to live there. 
Where the rocks are softer, and less disturbed by mountain 
folding, there are lower and more level tracts. . . . 
The coast line of the British Isles is very irregular, as may be 
seen from the map. State the reasons. How does the coast com- 
pare with that of New England? Since the mountainous western 
portion had more deep valleys for the sea to enter than the level

as well as references to pages, maps, and illustrations, are omitted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
    
150 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
plains of the east, there are more good harbors on the west than on 
the east coast. On both sides, however, the mouths of the larger 
rivers usually make good ports. Why? 
Another reason for the importance of the United Kingdom is 
the fact that these islands have great natural resources, and have 
therefore developed important industries. In our study of the 
United States we found that the people are mainly engaged in 
lumbering, agriculture, fishing, mining, manufacturing, and 
commerce. There is almost no lumbering in the British Isles, 
for, although in early times a large part of the land was wooded, 
little forest now remains; and lumber is, therefore, one of the 
leading imports... . 
Since no portion of the British Isles is arid, the ranching industry 
is not developed there asin the western United States. Much live 
stock is raised, however, . . . and the British Isles are noted for 
their great number of fine cattle, sheep, and horses... . The 
Shetland Islands are famous for Shetland ponies; and on the three 
Channel Islands, — Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney, near the 
French coast,—three breeds of cattle which are well known in 
the United States have been developed. 
The importance of grazing is partly explained by the fact that 
much of the surface, like that of New England, is too rocky or 
mountainous to be cultivated. Besides this, some of the plains in 
eastern England, although too sterile for farming, make excellent 
pasture land. The mild winters and the damp air, which en- 
courage the growth of grass, further favor stock raising. Inadd 
tion, the cheapness with which grain is raised in other countries, 
like the United States, and carried to the British Isles, has made 
it less necessary for the British to use their land in raising grain. 
The cool summer climate, of advantage in some respects, is 
unfavorable to many kinds of farming. For example, it prevents 
the production of corn, cotton, tobacco, and grapes, which 
require warm summers. More hardy products, however, such as 
oats, barley, and wheat, are easily raised. Turnips, potatoes, 
   
-P-A-G-E-163
  
  POLITICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY 151 
beans, and peas are other important crops; also hops, which, 
together with barley, are used in the manufacture of beer. Owing 
to the many towns and cities, truck farming is of great importance. 
Since the early inhabitants had to cross the sea in order to reach 
these islands, and since most of their descendants have lived either 
on or near the coast, it is natural that many of the British should 
adopt a seafaring life. This sort of life has also been encouraged 
by the fact that food fish abound on the shallow banks of the 
North Sea and of the ocean to the north and west of the islands. 
More than one hundred thousand men and twenty-five thousand 
boats from the British Isles are employed in fishing. 
Among the fish caught are cod, haddock, and herring, as off 
the coast of New England and Newfoundland... . Many fishing 
hamlets are scattered along the coast; but the fishing industry 
here, as in our country, is becoming centered more and more in 
the large towns, which possess the capital for large vessels and 
expensive fishing outfits. The chief fishing centers, like Boston 
and Gloucester in Massachusetts, are LonDon, Hutt, and GrimsBY 
in England, and ABERDEEN in Scotland. 
One of the resources of the British Isles which early attracted 
people from southern Europe was the tin in southwestern England. 
This metal is not mined in many parts of the world, but has always 
been in great demand. Even before the time of Cesar, ships from 
the Mediterranean came to England to obtain tin for use in the 
manufacture of bronze. 
On the other hand, the abundance of two other minerals, coal 
and iron ore, reminds us of our own country. The one small island 
of Great Britain produces three fourths as much coal as all of 
our states together; and the United States and Great Britain are 
the two leading coal-producing countries of the world. While 
most of the coal is bituminous, that in southern Wales is more 
likeouranthracite. Large numbers of miners in the United States 
are Welshmen who have come from that section. 
Iron ore is also abundant and favorably situated. None of 
   
-P-A-G-E-164
    
152 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
the British iron ore is far from coal; and in some places the same 
shaft is used to bring both coal and iron to the surface. Limestone 
is also abundant and near at hand. This reminds us of the condi 
tions at Birmingham, Ala., which is named after BIRMINGHAM, 
England, because they resemble each other in having an abundance 
of coal and iron ore near together. The extent of the mining in- 
dustry in the United Kingdom is indicated by the fact that more 
than half a million persons are employed underground. . . . 
Considering the abundance of coal and iron ore on the one hand 
and of wool from the millions of sheep on the other, it is clear that 
Great Britain has materials for extensive manufacture. As in 
New England, the hilly sections have abundant water power due 
to the glacier, and this also has favored manufacturing. Later, 
when the use of steam became known, the abundant stores of 
coal were of great importance. .. . 
From the spinning and weaving of wool it was easy to turn to 
the manufacture of cotton goods; and on the western side of the 
northern mountains we find a great cotton-manufacturing in- 
‘dustry. Dampness is one of the points in favor of that section, 
for in a dry air cotton is in danger of becoming too brittle to spin 
and weave easily. Another reason why this work is best developed 
on the west side of the island is the fact that it is nearer the United 
States, from which so much of the raw cotton comes. 
Since the British climate will not permit the cultivation of 
cotton, it is necessary to import all that is used. It requires over 
two billion pounds a year to supply the mills. Although much 
cotton is now obtained from Egypt, India, and other parts of the 
British Empire, our Southern States still supply the greatest 
quantit: The center of the cotton manufacturing is Man- 
CHESTER. What other cities do you find situated near by : 
The three industries connected with cotton, wool, and iron ewe 
made Great Britain one of the great workshops of the world. The 
most important is cotton manufacturing; iron ranks next, and 
wool is third. 
     
-P-A-G-E-165
LITICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY 153 
What has thus far been said applies chiefly to Great Britain; 
but Ireland forms a striking contrast to Great Britain in several 
respects. In the first place, it is mainly a country of farms instead 
of manufactures. . . . 
First among the coastal cities to be noted is Lonpon, on the 
east side, with BrisToL opposite it on the west coast. North of 
London is Hutt, with Liverpoot on the opposite side; and in 
southern Scotland is EpinBuRGH, near the coast, paired with 
Gtascow on the west. On the south side the two most important 
ports are SouTHAMPTON and PortsmouTH. What are the two 
principal cities of Ireland? Locate each. 
Steamships, railway lines, and canals connect the various cities, 
carrying immense quantities of freight. In Great Britain and 
Ireland there are nearly four thousand miles of canal and over 
twenty-three thousand miles of railway. 
London, the capital of the empire and the largest city in the 
world, is situated on the Thames River. Like many other British 
rivers, the Thames has a wide, deep mouth, owing to the sinking 
of the land. London is located upon its banks as far inland as 
high tide allows vessels to go, or fifty miles from the open sea. 
The advantage of this position lies in the fact that, while it is in 
the interior of the island, it has direct water communication with 
foreign countries. 
(Then follows a description of London, comparing 
with other chief cities.) 
While we have learned many facts about ‘the. British Isles, 
some important questions are not yet fullyanswered. For example, 
why does this little country possess more colonies than any other 
nation of the earth? Further, why should it have the greatest 
foreign trad And why, the greatest number of vessels upon 
the sea? 
Some of the reasons in answer to these questions are as follows: 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
154 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
The fact that Great Britain is so small — no point in the island 
being more than seventy miles from salt water — is a reason w 
many of the British have become sailors. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that they have been great explorers. 
Nor is it to be wondered at that, as these explorers discovered 
new parts of the world, they laid claim to them in the name of 
their mother country. In this way, and by war, Great Britain 
came into possession of the Thirteen Colonies of North America, 
and of Canada, India, Australia, much of Africa, and many other 
places. At present her territory includes about one fifth of the 
land surface of the globe, and one quarter of its inhabitants. 
These colonies and dependencies help to explain Great Britain’s 
enormous foreign commerce; for the colonies have found it more 
to their advantage to trade with the mother country than with 
other nations, which speak a different language and have less 
understanding of them or sympathy with them. The colonies 
sell raw products and foodstuffs to the mother country, and she 
sends to them clothing, steel goods, and other manufactured 
articles. It is largely the exchange of goods with these colonies 
that has made the foreign trade of Great Britain nearly twice that 
of any other nation. Next to her colonies, Great Britain’s greatest 
trade is with the United States. 
Some of the reasons why this little island owns more vessels 
than any other nation have already appeared. In fishing, ex- 
ploring, and making settlements, a large number of ships have 
been needed; and many warships have been required for the 
proper defense of her widely scattered colonies. Another reason 
for so large a havy is the fact that the British Isles are cut off from 
all other nations by water. For defense, therefore, the British 
must rely upon warships rather than upon a standing army. 
Further than this, the British are actually forced to own many 
ships. Here are over forty million people living on two small 
islands, from whose soil it is impossible to obtain the necessary food. 
They must send ships away for their flour, meat, sugar, tea, coffee, 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
POLITICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY 155 
etc.; and they must send abroad for much of their raw materials 
for manufacture. Also, in order to pay for the raw materials and 
food, their manufactured goods must be shipped to all parts of 
the world; otherwise such extensive manufacturing would be 
impossible. From this it is plain why a very large number of 
vessels must be employed; and there are two reasons why the 
British, rather than other nations, should own them. In the 
first place, such trade is profitable; and secondly, when they own 
their own vessels, they can send them where and when they will, 
and are therefore independent in case of war. 
These facts, coupled with the remarkable energy of the British, 
are the principal reasons why the United Kingdom greatly surpasses 
all other nations in number of warships and merchant vessels. 
The comparative examination of primary and ad- 
vanced textbooks by different authors would be profit- 
able. Unfortunately some of them do not fully accord 
with the principles of pedagogy. 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
    
CHAPTER XIII 
SUPPLEMENTARY READING 
The need of an attractive presentation. —The interest 
aroused by the study of geography depends upon the 
inherent attractiveness of the facts to be learned; upon 
how they are told; how elaborated by association ; how 
rendered vivid by description; how pictured to the eye ; 
how humanized by allusion to human affairs; and 
upon how these facts are connected with each other, 
with other studies, and with daily life. 
Baldness of most texts. — A mere summary of the 
facts to be learned in a course of geography would be 
about as interesting as the dictionary. Geography 
should read like a story. The chief reason why this 
subject has no interest for so many is that the ordinary 
textbooks are so meager and laconic in their treatment, 
and so little is done by the teacher to elaborate the text. 
If the teacher did her part, filling in the mere dry bones 
of the text with the life and blood of interesting matter, 
then such an epitomized form of textbook would suffice. 
This is the European method. In this country, however, 
geography is based too much upon the text alone. 
156 
   
-P-A-G-E-169
SUPPLEMENTARY READING 157 
Supplementary readers. — To furnish the additional 
subject matter, to infuse life and interest into the subject, 
we have supplementary readers. These are not written 
in the brief, categorical style of the textbook, but are 
often real books of travel, full of local color and human 
interest. They are specific, not general. 
Some of these supplementary readers adopt the plan 
of representing children touring the countries described, 
which insures more the child’s viewpoint of looking 
at the world. Many of these books take up special 
phases — the industries, the foods of man, domesticated 
animals, the dwellings of man, or the means of trans- 
portation. Some treat of the sky, of the weather, the 
land and water. Some are biographical, and some deal 
with discovery and exploration. A host of nature readers 
are useful in geography. There are also books of original 
descriptions by great travelers and writers. 
Uses of the supplementary literature. — By correlating 
such literature with geography, the breadth of the 
subject is materially increased. Supplementary readers 
may be used in various ways. In primary geography 
only the simpler kind can be read by the pupil himself, 
and this should be done chiefly in class. The teacher 
should occasionally read from them to the pupils. The 
same thing may be done in upper grades, but here more 
independent reading should be expected. In the seventh 
and eighth grades a little reference work can be at- 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
158 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
tempted, but the references should be very definitely 
assigned: This is good for the topical study and type 
study methods. Other texts, standard reference books, 
and encyclopedias should also be used in such refer- 
ence work. Encyclopedias, however, should be used 
with care, as, for grammar grades, much in them is too 
abstruse. 
School libraries should be well stocked with good 
supplementary literature in geography. Of such books 
as Carpenter’s Geographical Readers there should 
be sets for a group or a whole class, for permanent use. 
Books of travel, discovery, exploration, etc., should be 
given to children for home reading, or for their leisure 
time in school. There are also good books of geograph- 
ical fiction, such as Robinson Crusoe, The Swiss Family 
Robinson, The Mysterious Island, Treasure Island, Around 
the World in Eighty Days, and many others, that should 
be placed within the children’s reach. 
In upper grades, where it is likely to be more ap- 
preciated, descriptions of scenery, architecture, etc., 
may be read by the teacher from such authors as Cooper, 
Scott, Irving, George Eliot, Stewart Edward White, 
John Muir, etc. In this way the esthetic appreciation 
of geography may be cultivated, an aim of no small 
importance when interest in the study is considered. 
The imagination is not greatly stimulated by the prosaic 
descriptions of topography in the ordinary textbook, 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  SUPPLEMENTARY READING 159 
and yet that is just what is needed to picture the beauty 
of physical forms, and to develop the habit of imaging the 
scenes described. See also page 284, on the esthetic 
side of geography. 
Current events taken from the daily papers and other 
journals are another form of supplementary reading. 
The special value of such reading, aside from developing 
the habit of reading the news, is that it impresses the 
reality of geography. The facts of the textbook seem 
so remote, rather unreal; but an interesting current 
event happening in a place previously mentioned in the 
book takes that place out of the book and gives it in 
the pupil’s mind a definite existence it never had before. 
Again such reading is an application of school geography 
which gives the pupil a mental satisfaction, and a realiza- 
tion of the usefulness of the subject. 
Various children’s and youths’ journals are either 
exclusively devoted to presenting current news, of 
interest to young people, or at least give some space 
thereto. In many classes of geography the pupils 
club together for subscription to such juvenile news- 
papers, which are used in connection with reading, 
history, and geography. By reading the news of the 
world the pupil enlarges his experience to a participation 
in the affairs of society at large and the world as a 
whole. 
Current events may be brought up as they bear ap- 
     
-P-A-G-E-172
160 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
propriately on the daily lessons. Or, a definite time on 
a certain day may be set aside for comment upon them. 
It is necessary to teach discrimination in such reading, 
and in this case only such news as has special geograph- 
ical significance should be discussed in the geography 
class. Other news may be correlated with history. In 
the lower grades the teacher must guide in the selection 
of these topics, and in the higher grades this may be done 
by a committee of pupils appointed to edit the news 
items brought in by the class. An interesting plan is to 
have a weekly newspaper prepared in this way, to be 
read to the class, and to furnish food for discussion. 
In treating current events it is not enough to simply 
read the news item and to tell where it occurred, or even 
to show it on the map. Enough more should be taught 
about the physiography, and the political conditions of 
the region, to give a proper basis for the full appreciation 
of the subject. For example, Peary’s Discovery of the 
North Pole needs for a proper setting reference to lati- 
tude, longitude, polar night and day, the aurora, the gor- 
geous atmospheric effects, the ice field, the animals of 
this region, the Eskimo, the routes leading to the Pole, 
the hardships of the explorer, etc. Ordinary maps, 
polar maps, the globe, and pictures of the Arctic scenes 
should accompany the account. 
It is profitable to take some progressive event, such as 
the cruise of the American fleet around the world, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
SUPPLEMENTARY READING 161 
even an automobile or walking race across the continent, 
and follow the course on the map. 
For current events, sketch maps on the board or on 
paper will be found very useful, even better than regular 
maps. Special maps showing details which cannot 
readily be found on ordinary maps may often be found 
in the news journals. These maps should be enlarged. 
An interesting method of treating current events is to 
make a scrap book containing news clippings, illustrated 
with newspaper and magazine pictures, postal cards, 
etc. Children always like to make these collections. 
A comparative examination of the news items brought 
in by the children would reveal to the teacher the chil- 
dren’s special interests in geography, and so might lead 
her to teach the subject more pedagogically and more 
successfully. 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
CHAPTER XIV 
MAPS 
“The root of all geographical ability lies in being at home 
with maps.” — MACKINDER. 
Maps are more or less symbolic representations of the 
earth on a flat surface by means of lines, characters, 
signs, and colors. A photograph, painting, or drawing 
may be made of some part of the earth’s surface and 
show with much truthful detail surface configuration, 
scenery, the habitations, and the works of man. The 
smaller the area represented, the better the study of the 
detail. _The larger the area, the more the details become 
lost in the perspective, and only the larger, general 
features, such as ground plan, topography, and distribu- 
tion of land and water, can be shown. 
Some maps are wholly pictorial; showing a bird’s- 
eye view of considerable areas, a city, or a state, 
with suggestions of scenery, houses, ships at sea, etc. 
Such maps are frequently used for beginners, and also 
are much seen in popular magazines and newspapers. 
From such pictorial maps one may proceed to others 
more and more symbolic. The houses and streets of a 
city are replaced by lines, dots, or circles; the pictures 
162 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
MAPS 163 
of hills and mountains by conventional characters or 
hachuring and shading; the variation in elevation is 
represented by different colors, or by contour lines. 
Maps a shorthand record of geographical knowledge. — 
Maps are the chief aid of the geographer. Primarily 
they serve to show the form, extent, location, direction, 
and the internal and external relations of a region. 
Many other features regarding climate, vegetable and 
animal life, and human life ma lso be shown. Maps 
are the resultant record of actual discovery, exploration, 
survey, measurement, and development of a region, and 
depict in shorthand what would take many pages of text 
to describe. /“‘ The fundamental conceptions of the geog- 
raphy of a country should be built up from the data fur- 
nished by maps rather than from textbooks.” (Geike.) 
Political map. — The most common form of map is 
the political. This emphasizes the human relations. It 
shows the location of towns:and cities, routes of travel 
and commerce, telegraph lines, canals, and the artificial 
divisions of the earth into nations and their civic subdi- 
visions. The physical features of latitude and longitude, 
the shape of the region, lakes and rivers, the seacoast 
and mountain ranges, are generally shown also. Owing 
to the many place names such maps are apt to be over- 
crowded and confusing, and the physical features are 
often apparently lost, at least not conspicuous. 
Special maps. —In commercial geography political 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  
    
164 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
maps are much used to show the distribution of mineral 
resources, vegetation regions, crop areas, density of 
cities, railway systems, etc. These features are some- 
times shown in special maps, each in a different map, 
being thus emphasized, to the neglect, perhaps, of the 
rest. 
Physical map. — Since it is too confusing or impossible 
to represent everything on one map, it is customary to 
use the political map to show the artificial, human 
relations, and the physical maps (described on page go) 
to represent topography, climatic conditions, etc. The 
physical features, also, are often analyzed and shown 
on special maps. 
Comparative study of maps. — By means of these 
special maps, showing some one feature analyzed out by 
itself, that feature may be studied without any confusing 
irrelevancies. Care should be taken, however, that 
these separate maps are again superimposed mentally 
to bring out the proper relations between them, or to 
show their composite effect. Thus the rainfall map 
should be associated with the wind map, and with the 
topographical, the vegetation, and the industrial maps. 
Introduction to the map. — The map being a chief 
means of learning geography, the pupil should be in- 
troduced to it early, and taught how to interpret it, to 
translate it into words. For this it is necessary to teach 
him what a map is, and what its various symbols mean. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  
  MAPS 165 
A prerequisite for map study is an idea of direction. 
This is usually taught in nature-study before geography 
is begun. The simplest and oldest method of fixing the 
points of the compass is by reference to the rising and 
the setting sun, and the sun at noonday. The word 
orientation is derived from this. The Orient is the land 
of the rising sun. To orient oneself is to get one’s 
bearings. See page 44. 
The points of the compass being known by beginners, 
the first study may be made of amap. Tomake the map 
concrete and intelligible two common methods are 
employed: the first is to show the pupil a photograph or 
other picture of a region, one containing both land and 
water features being good, and then a map of the same 
region, requiring the pupil to discover the various 
features shown in the picture. 
The other way to get the pupil to appreciate the map 
is to let him draw one for himself, a very simple one, the 
map of the schoolroom. The approximate dimensions 
of the room are found, the minor irregularities being dis- 
regarded. The points of the compass are noted. The 
pupils are told to draw a floor plan of the room. The 
teacher using a sheet of paper like the pupils’ shows 
them or directs them step by step how to proceed. 
As for scale, fourth grade children are scarcely ready 
in their arithmetic to appreciate its significance. All 
that is really necessary here is to see that the picture 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
    
166 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
must be much smaller than the room. The teacher may 
tell the class to represent the length of the room by a 
certain. number of inches. The rest will then follow 
according to scale, if proportions are observed. The 
pupils may need some assistance in placing the plan 
properly on the paper. Each wall is drawn as directed, 
and properly named according to the points of the com- 
pass. The teacher’s and the pupil’s own desk may then 
be sketched in, keeping the proper relations. The term 
map may then be used instead of plan. Each line and 
symbol drawn is now significant to the child. He knows 
the real things they stand for. 
A further step is to draw the school block with the 
neighboring treets. By pacing the comparative lengths 
may be obtained. The block is drawn in proportion, and 
the school correctly located. In this study, again, the 
points of the compass should be observed. 
Next a real map of the locality should be presented. 
First find the school block, the neighboring streets, and 
familiar objects; then streets and places farther off, 
perhaps seen or heard of; and then new and unknown 
features may bé discovered. 
It is important in this early map work, especially in 
home geography, to lay the map horizontally, with its 
directions corresponding to the points of the compass. 
That is, the north of the map should be placed toward 
the real north. Placed in this way the map may be used 
   
-P-A-G-E-179
MAPS 167 
to find the direction of familiar or less known places. 
The pupils can then readily point to these places, or 
possibly go to them. If such a study of the locality 
were made on the roof of the school, from upper win- 
dows, or some high hill commanding a view of the sur- 
rounding region, it would be very effective. 
The map is, however, for convenience hung on the wall. 
The pupils should learn how this changes the relations of 
the map to the real points of the compass. The map 
is least out of correct relation with the points of the 
compass when hung on the north wall. By comparison 
with the map in the horizontal and correct position, 
the fact may be brought out that when suspended, and 
also when placed in books, the north is usually at the 
top of the map, the south at the bottom, east at the 
right, and west at the left hand. Sometimes, however, 
maps are found with the north not at the top, in which 
case there is generally some guide, as a cross mark or 
other design showing the directions. 
In locating and describing directions on the map 
pupils should not be permitted to say “‘ up” when they 
mean north, and “ down” when they mean south. Up 
and down may be used in map study only to refer to 
topography, elevations, slopes, drainage, river courses, 
and the like. The Nile flows down, north. The trunk 
railroads across the United States go from the Missis- 
sippi Valley up the gently rising prairies to the Great 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
168 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Plains, and still higher up over the Western mountains, 
and then down to the Coast. 
Imagination in map study.—In all map work, espe- 
cially in the early home geography, the real geographical 
experiences of the pupils in the territory shown should 
be recalled in order to make the map meaningful and 
concrete. Begin the first map study with the vicinity 
of the home and school, then trace out routes of travel 
and well-known landmarks. Pupils should try to 
imagine, to see, the real streets, stores, factories, public 
buildings, streams, hills, etc., indicated by the symbols on 
the map, which is easy if he has seen them. In the same 
way he should try to picture the things shown on the 
map with which he is not so familiar. The use of pic- 
tures and vivid oral description by the teacher are an 
assistance in getting beyond the mere map. 
In the more advanced geography it is just as essential 
to bring up in the mind’s eye the lay of the land, the 
scenery, the vegetation, the occupations of the people, 
the architecture, etc. The map study of the outline 
of North America should leave the pupil with a picture 
of the level, frozen tundra of the Arctic Coast; the bleak 
promontories of Labrador; the ‘‘stern and rock-bound 
coast” of New England; the sandy pleasure beaches and 
the low and swampy shores from New York to Florida 
and along the Gulf Coast; the arid mountain shore 
of western Mexico and/ lower California; the narrow 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  MAPS 169 
fringe of coastal plain with the snow-capped mountains 
beyond in the stretch from California to Alaska; the 
fiord coast of the Northwest with its thousand islands, 
the forest primeval of conifers, and the gleaming glaciers. 
Colonel Parker used to speak of “‘the terrible habit of 
not seeing beyond the map.” The pupil who believes 
that the earth looks just like the map, or perhaps does 
not associate the map at all with the earth, has very bar- 
ren results from his map study, — as barren as that of the 
author of a textbook mentioned by Rousseau, who defined 
the earth in this way, “‘The earth is a globe of papier- 
maché.” Mere bounding and locating in map work 
is apt to be mechanical unless imaging the reality is 
practiced. 
Thought in map study. — ‘“‘ Map reading is not finding 
names merely, nor knowing what the different characters 
stand for. The content, the thought, the geistiger In- 
halt, must be read in: boundaries, natural and political, 
nature of the coast, islands, sounds, trend of mountains, 
declivity, drainage, passes, plateaus, plains, etc. Be- 
tween the lines should be read generalizations and prin- 
ciples of physiography, commercial geography, etc.” 
(Trunk.) 
The wall maps and maps in the textbook for primary 
geography should be simple in outline, and should 
present only the most important physical and _polit- 
ical features, not much more than is taken up in these 
   
-P-A-G-E-182
170 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
years. Overcrowded maps are very confusing and 
time-wasting. 
Conduct of map study. — The first map study should 
be conducted by ‘the teacher to teach the children how to 
use a map, how to read it, and to show what may be 
inferred from it. The pupils may, or may not, have 
their books open at the map. The teacher points out 
and names the data to be learned. The pupils are re- 
quired to find them again on the wall map, and perhaps 
also on their text maps. As new map symbols are used 
they should be explained. Pupils should be taught the 
use of the scale and the table or legend of explanations. 
For purposes of drill and review blank maps and 
sketch maps, not giving the names of the places and phys- 
ical features, are excellent. In using these, too great ac- 
curacy of location should not be demanded of beginners, 
approximation being sufficient. 
Much of the map study consists in locating and 
bounding. This is an essential function of map work, 
but requires judgment in determining what is important* 
and what is not, else it is apt to run into perfunctory, 
thoughtless routine. Much time may be killed in this 
way that should be devoted to descriptive study or to 
thinking out geographical relationships. The object 
of locating and bounding is, of course, to teach space 
relations, or situation, that the other geographical sig- 
nificance of the places thus treated may be better ap- 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
MAPS 171 
preciated. That is, locating and bounding are not an 
end in themselves. They help to fix the mental image of 
the map, a very important thing, but that is not their 
whole function. 
Memory-aiding associations. —In studying confines 
and situations, interesting and profitable associations 
should be brought in, both to make the work attractive 
and to give additional knowledge. A brief reference to 
the historic or commercial relations with a neighboring 
country, and racial differences; a suggestion of the 
appearance and character of the surrounding waters, 
or of the bounding mountains; the natural and polit- 
ical reasons for boundaries being where they are; the 
physical, political, and industrial effect of border moun- 
tains, rivers, etc.; the historical cause for the founding 
of a city; the advantages and disadvantages of the site 
chosen for a city, —are profitable allusions. It is not 
necessary for pupils to commit to memory these asso- 
ciations. It is sufficient for the teacher to make the 
commentaries or to develop these associations in passing. 
By doing this the map work acquires a significance 
impossible without it; it helps the memory to retain the 
map image; and pupils learn to look for broader geo- 
graphical principles involved in locative relations. Also 
many of the associations brought out will be retained 
by the children without effort. 
Telling the meaning of names is another good way to 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
172 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
attach interesting memory-aiding associations to the 
map work. See Chapter XVII. 
Map study should be conducted logically and sys- 
tematically. — Map questions should not be asked in 
promiscuous order, for thus a chaotic jumble will result 
in the pupil’s mind. Physical features of location, 
extent, configuration, surface, climate, drainage, dis- 
tribution of vegetation and animal life, and the mineral 
resources should be taken in sequential order, and 
should precede the study of the political features, 
location of cities, means of communication, etc. The 
map and the text description of a country should go 
together. By a systematic study like this an organized 
unity, a rational relationship, the influence of the envi- 
ronment, and the adaptation of man are more readily 
and clearly perceived by the pupil than from a “ hit or 
miss” order of map questions. (Of course, for purposes 
of mere drill such a miscellaneous order is permissible.) 
Causal relations in map study.— The map work should 
not be simply to answer the questions of the old “ sail- 
or’s geography ” of What ? and Where? The question 
Why? should frequently be asked, especially in the 
upper grades. From maps alone many of the funda- 
mental principles of physical and political geography 
may be developed. Why are there so few cities in 
Labrador? Why are there so few in Nevada? Why 
does the Southern Pacific Railroad go by way of 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
MAPS 173 
El Paso? Why has Chicago become so large? Etc. 
Such questions exercise the reason as well as mere 
memory. 
Overemphasis of map study.—In the old geography 
there was much insistence upon a vast amount of map 
work, chiefly locational. It was assumed necessary to 
get the capes, bays, rivers, mountains, countries, cities, 
etc., fixed in mind before the description of the country 
was taken up in the textbook. In some of the older 
texts the map of the whole world was first memorized 
before any descriptive study was undertaken. In this 
day this is considered mere unthinking drudgery, and 
text and map are closely associated. Pupils should be 
taught to put the map work and the text together. 
Such a map habit, if well established, is useful in later 
life in locating current events, in reading history and 
literature. 
The reaction. — The overemphasis of map work in 
former days has led to the present reaction toward sim- 
pler maps, fewer map questions for the sake of the map 
alone, and more association of map and text. In prac- 
tice, however, there is danger that the very necessary 
map study may be slighted. Such work is fundamental, 
and must be done, or the descriptive matter will lose 
definiteness of location, and also the logic of many causal 
relations. Drill is very necessary, not only in locations 
of states, cities, physical features, and the like, but also 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
174 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
in fixing the relation of the physical features to each 
other and their effect on human life. 
Maps should be supplemented with globe study. — 
One criticism must be made of the use of maps: Through 
the unvaried use of the map representing the earth in the 
flat an incorrect and inadequate notion of the earth 
and the relation of the lands is given. 
This may be corrected by the globe in connection 
with the map. It is a good plan, in general, when begin- 
ning the study of a new continent, to study its relations 
as shown on the globe. Location, extent, latitude, 
longitude, comparative area, and the relation to pre- 
viously studied continents may thus be correctly seen. 
The globe is useful also in many other lessons in 
descriptive geography, especially in the study of com- 
mercial relations, marine commerce, transoceanic tele- 
graph lines, imaginary routes, polar studies, etc. Usually 
the globe is brought out during the study of mathemat- 
ical geography and then relegated to the closet. 
If we wish to get the pupil beyond the flat map to the 
round earth, we must use the globe. Ask pupils to point 
toward Europe and they will point out horizontally to the 
east, that is, in a line tangent to the earth, which would 
land them out in space, instead of pointing east and at 
the same. time somewhat downward, so as to point 
through the earth. For Americans China is not simply 
west, but on the other side of the earth, down.

CHAPTER XV 
MAP DRAWING 
Purpose. — Map drawing is the usual accompani- 
ment of the study of geography. It is done for two 
reasons, —as a means of map study, and as a means of 
geographical expression. 
The pedagogical reason for requiring the drawing ofa 
map for study is that in the reproduction of a map the 
pupil observes with more care the details of direction, 
proportion, relationship, physical features, etc., than by 
merely studying a book or wall map; that by such 
detailed observation he will know the map more thor- 
oughly ; that by such care in study and drill in drawing, 
the map will be impressed more indelibly on the eye- 
memory. ‘We all carry mental maps in our brains.” 
(Trottner.) 
Map drawing is easily overdone. — When this object 
is attained there is no further need for such careful, 
time-consuming work. There was a period in the last 
generation when map drawing was overdone. Pupils 
generally enjoy this creative handwork of making 
maps, and the temptation is to let them draw much. 
Very nearly as good map knowledge, however, may be 
175 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
176 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
acquired by the proper study of printed maps in books 
and for the wall, or by the use of printed outline maps. 
Moreover, a map may be drawn accurately and beauti- 
fully and still with so little thought on its geographical 
content that the pupil gains little or nothing more than 
the benefit from an exercise in drawing and painting. 
The meridian net method. — Various methods have 
been suggested for drawing maps. Some would have 
maps drawn scientifically according to latitude and 
longitude. This is undoubtedly the best method for 
maturer students in high schools and colleges, and may 
be tried in a simple way in the upper grammar grades 
to teach more fully the meaning of meridians, parallels, 
surveys, and the principles of cartography. Some 
teachers require the memorizing of the latitude and longi- 
tude of the salient points of a map to be drawn so that 
memory or sketch maps may be quickly made with fair 
accuracy. Some have students construct their own 
meridian nets, and some use blanks with the meridians 
already drawn, and still others use blanks with the me- 
ridian net and the salient points of the map already 
checked in. 
The method of squares. — Another method, not so 
geographical, but aiding in producing an accurate copy, 
is to rule the map to be copied with lines dividing it 
into squares, and then reproducing these on the desired 
scale on the paper on which the map is to be drawn. 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
MAP DRAWING 177 
The squares assist in getting direction and proportion 
more accurately. This method should not be applied 
to books not owned by the pupil, as the map is more or 
less ruined thereby. Printed outline maps may be sub- 
stituted in such a case. 
Construction diagrams undesirable. — Another for- 
merly used mechanical method, having nothing to rec- 
ommend it, except that it served fairly well for memory 
maps if the pupil could remember the scheme, was to 
construct arbitrary ‘‘ construction diagrams ” for block- 
ing out the proportions of the areas to be drawn. 
Simple copy method. — These methods are too diffi- 
cult for the elementary school, or too mechanical. The 
best method is to let the pupil copy the map as he 
would a picture on a blackboard or in the drawing book 
in the art lesson. If drawing is taught in the school, as 
is most likely, the pupils already have the necessary 
principles of drawing, — getting directions and propor- 
tions, the two essentials in map drawing. 
The simpler maps (such as in Frye’s Grammar School 
Geography, Supplement) should be used for copy, or 
pupils may be advised to disregard the minor irregulari- 
ties of coast and river, and of boundaries, but to note 
carefully the general lines of the outline, etc. The map 
should be neatly spaced on the paper. The drawing is 
begun, preferably, at the northwest corner, chiefly to 
avoid smearing, and that one may see the portion already 
N 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
178 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
drawn. The outline is sketched in very lightly at 
first. Before proceeding far, the lines already drawn 
should be compared critically with the copy map. 
Should this line go farther north or south? Does that 
line run exactly northeast, or more nearly toward the 
north? By asking oneself such questions the lines as 
sketched may be checked with the original, and if not 
correct, should be essayed again. After direction of 
lines, the next most important thing is their proportion- 
ate length. With beginners, nothing need be taught 
about scale. Simply the direction to make the map 
of a certain size, or as large as the paper will allow, is 
sufficient. The older pupils should learn to draw accord- 
ing to scale. To make a copy half or twice as large as 
the original, every line of the copy must be made half or 
twice as long as the original. The first line drawn deter- 
mines the scale. The next line in a new direction 
should now be drawn in the same proportion or scale. 
By thus always judging proportionate lengths with the 
parts already drawn, and keeping directions true, the 
map will remain correct in shape. 
After the outline is thus sketched in, and retouched 
lightly to satisfaction, it may be traced or lined in 
more heavily. 
After the outline is drawn, the mountains should be 
put in as a guide for drawing the rivers. Rivers 
should be drawn carefully to conform to the slopes of 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
MAP DRAWING 179 
and special attention should be paid to their 
divides. The location of the other features involves 
no difficulty. 
Great accuracy in map drawing should not be expected 
of children. Even the best of printed maps are far from 
accurate. For fixing the map relations thus by draw- 
ing, pupils should be expected simply to do the best 
they can. 
The early map drawing should not be left to the pupil 
alone, but should be done under the supervision and 
direction of the teacher, who should guide and assist 
with the mechanical difficulties, and, what is important, 
at the same time teach the geographical facts of the 
map. 
Progressive maps. — For a systematic study of a 
country covering several days, it is often a good plan 
not to finish a map all at once, but to spread it over 
the period of study, each day recording on the map, 
and thus organizing, what was studied that day. Such 
a slow-growing map is called a Progressive Map. It is 
one of the best means of summarizing and organizing 
in geography. 
Coloring, shading, and finishing. — Maps are the 
most tangible evidence of a pupil’s study of geography, 
hence they are always displayed in exhibits of school 
work. The temptation, therefore, is to embellish them 
more than is really necessary for the purposes of geog- 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
180 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
raphy. An unconscionable amount of time may be 
wasted thus, in coloring, wave-lining, shading, lettering, 
etc., that might be better employed in reading the 
descriptive text. For most purposes a simple pencil 
drawing is sufficient. Sometimes for better distinction 
of political divisions, or for indicating elevation, or to 
represent distribution features, the map may be either 
shaded in black or painted. Care should be taken to 
select harmonious, rather neutral, tints. The color 
should not be applied too thickly, a common fault with 
beginners. If colored crayons are used, or shading in 
black is attempted, the work should be done smoothly, 
not in scratchy lines. In using water colors, care must 
be taken to avoid running over the edges, and to prevent 
water lines. The drawing of elaborate frills or ripples 
along the coasts should be discouraged. If the map is 
to be inked in and lettered in ink, this must be done 
after the coloring. For most purposes it will do to write 
the names in neat script. Printing is more difficult, and 
does not look well unless uniform. If many data are 
~ to be recorded, the writing must be small, to prevent 
a confused or cluttered appearance. As a rule, the 
writing or printing looks better if not written at all 
angles, but if written in parallel lines. This also saves 
space. Of course, this is not always possible. When a 
emap is full of data represented by lines, characters, or 
colors, a legend or table of explanations should accom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
MAP DRAWING 181 
pany the map. Sometimes to avoid crowding, cities, 
etc., are simply numbered or initialed, and the explana- 
tion given in the legend. 
Printed outline maps. — The drawing of fine maps is 
such a slow, time-consuming process that it has rightly 
been reduced to a minimum in the school requirements. 
A great labor-saving device are the printed outline maps 
now in common use, though once condemned as much 
as Emmy Lou’s system of drawing by tracing through 
tissue paper. They may now be obtained from various 
publishers for all the continents, the United States, 
sections of the United States, separate states, and even 
cities. The pupils line them in more heavily and fill 
them with the data studied. The advantages are uni- 
formity, accuracy of outline, and saving of effort and 
time. They may be used for both the first studies of a 
map and for reviews. The disadvantage, which may 
be guarded against by thoughtful study, is that they may 
be filled in too mechanically, and that the visual image 
created by them is not as definite as that acquired 
through copy. 
Maps to test the pupil’s knowledge. — The other 
purpose of map drawing, besides that of getting the 
idea of the space relations of the map, is to express 
geographical knowledge. By means of a memory 
sketch map a pupil can give the teacher a fair idea of 
his understanding of the subject. Pupils should not 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
182 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
only recite in words, but also by means of maps on paper 
or on the board. 
Sketch maps. — Such maps should be either sketch 
maps from memory, or filled in on the printed outline 
maps. They should take but little time, great accuracy 
being out of the question. Yet this need not matter, 
so long as the map is recognizable, and the pupil has 
not been careless, and the general relations of things 
are fairly well observed. 
Such sketch maps are very useful for illustrating top- 
. ical papers, reviews, drills, and tests. 
Blackboard sketches by the teacher. — The teacher 
herself should make much use of sketch maps on the 
blackboard during the recitation. Such sketches help 
to analyze difficult relations in the ordinary wall maps, 
or emphasize special features, serve sometimes as excel- 
lent substitutes for wall maps when these are not handy, 
take the place of printed blank maps for purposes of 
drill and review, and are in general indispensable.

CHAPTER XVI 
CARTOGRAPHY 
“Ninety-nine out of a hundred form their idea of geography 
from the map, not the globe, yet do not know the inaccuracies 
of the map.” — Morrison. 
There are no correct maps possible except on the 
globe, and here only theoretically, for globe maps 
also may contain inaccuracies of human judgment in 
discovery, compilation, and construction. They are 
too small to take account of the minor details] The 
ordinary globe also does not allow for the oblateness of 
the earth. Still, globe maps are the most correct of 
all in principle. Flat maps are always more or less dis- 
torted, therefore untrue. Globe maps are the only kind 
that represent the meridians and parallels in their 
correct relations. On globe maps alone is the scale of 
distance the same in all directions and in all parts. 
Globe maps alone represent areas correctly. 
Globes therefore are very valuable in geography. — 
Naturally they are the best representation of the earth 
for mathematical geography. Aside from such use 
globes show best the relations of the continents, their 
location on the sphere, their comparative areas, and their 
183 
   
-P-A-G-E-196
184 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
correct shape. The globe is best for showing the-hemi- 
spheres, land and water, northern and southern, eastern 
and western. The globe is useful in studying com- 
mercial routes, and real or imaginary journeys around 
the world. It should find more frequent use in political 
geography than is the case. 
Why flat maps are inaccurate. — The flat map attempts 
the impossible,— to represent a spherical surface in the 
plane. If one should peel off half an orange rind intact 
and then try to flatten it out, it would tear and split 
along the edges, or if it were elastic and tenacious enough, 
it would stretch around the margin. In either case the 
hemisphere would be greatly mutilated, modified, or dis- 
torted. The same thing happens in attempting to flatten 
out a globe map. 
Maps, the ordinary flat kind, are at best makeshifts 
or approximations of the real map of the earth. Some 
sorts are nearer the truth than others. A brief sketch is 
here given of the commoner methods of designing maps 
and charts, illustrating various ways of getting around 
the difficulty of distortion. Only the maps commonly 
seen in school will be described, in order that the teacher 
may realize their defects and limitations, as well as their 
proper function. 
Cartography is the art of compiling, designing, and 
drawing maps. A. chart maker is a cartographer. 
Many learned men from the days of the ancient Greek 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  CARTOGRAPHY 185 
mathematicians have suggested various designs or pro- 
jections for representing the earth in maps. 
—The orthogsaphic projection is an early form. Im- 
agine a plane’ tangent to the globe, and lines to fall 
perpendicularly on this plane from every point of the 
globe. Where these lines intersect the plane, there are 
the projections of the points of the globe map. These 
Fie. 10.— Construction of the orthographic projection. 
projected points will constitute the orthographically 
projected map on the plane. The globe map may thus 
be thought of as being projected, transferred, or thrown 
direct upon the plane. In A (Fig. 10) the earth is seen 
from the pole and the meridians are projected on MN. 
B is the earth in equatorial aspect, with the parallels
-P-A-G-E-198
186 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
projected on MN. C shows the meridians and parallels 
on the projected map. 
Another way to conceive such a map is to look at a 
globe with distinctly marked meridians and parallels, 
from a considerable distance, the line of sight being in 
the equatorial plane. The globe will look flat like a 
disk, and its lines will look as in the diagram (Fig. 10, C). 
Note that the parallels appear as straight lines, so also 
the central meridian, and that the meridians ‘are more 
and more curved as they proceed outward. The me- 
ridians and parallels are also crowded by foreshorten- 
ing at the margins. 
Limitations of the 
orthographic projec- 
tion. —It is evident 
that regions in the 
margin of the hemi- 
sphere are contracted 
and distorted, ~ and 
that only the middle 
portion of the map is 
fairly accurate. This 
form of projection is 
not much used for

polar maps. This projection was invented by Hippar- 
chus, a Greek astronomer and mathematician, who lived 
about 150 B.c. 
The globular projection is the most common for 
hemisphere maps. It was devised by De la Hire, of 
tion of globular projection. 
France (1704). Imagine a transparent half globe, with a 
transparent plane covering the cut surface, and the eye 
on the diameter at right angles to this plane, and at a 
distance from the plane slightly greater (1.7) than the 
radius of the globe. Project the points of the globe map. 
oro the plane along lines passing from them directly 
to the eye. The eye would see the equator as a straight 
line, the parallels as half ellipses; meridians running 
naturally without crowding, both equally spaced. The 
projected map appears on the plane of projection as the 
eye thus sees the meridians and parallels.

Merits of this projection.—Such a map nicely simu- 
lates the appearance of a globe with its curving meridians 
and parallels, and suggests the rotundity of the earth. 
It is, however, not on the same scale throughout. It

will be noted that the distances between two parallels 
on the central and a marginal meridian are not the same, 
as is the case with real parallels. The error is about 
1 to 13. The marginal parts of the map are there- 
fore stretched. 
Mercator’s projection, among many others, was de- 
vised by that brilliant Flemish-German, Gerhard 
Kramer (1512-1594), who revolutionized the art of 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
CARTOGRAPHY 189 
map making, and started the great German school of 
scientific cartographers that 
has continued to the present 
day. (Mercator is the Latin- 
ized version of Kramer, a mer- 
chant. During the Middle 
Ages it was not fashionable 
for the learned men to use the 
vernacular in their writings, 
and they even signed their 
names in Vatin, the language 
of science and culture.) Mer- 
cator’s plan of projection may 
be considered as_ follows: 
Imagine a cylinder tangent 
to the globe at its equator 
(Fig. 14). From the center 
of the globe draw radii 
through the various points A, 
B,C, etc., of the globe map 
to the tangent cylinder. The 
places where these radii ex- 
tended strike the cylinder are 
the projections of these points 
of the globe map. Now im-

along one side, and unfurled. 4.—Construction of

The projected map will

then appear on the outside surface in the flat. Parallels 
appear here as straight lines, and the meridians likewise, 
at right angles to the others. 
Defects and merits of this projection. —The most 
glaring fault of the projection is at once seen in the fact

that the meridians do not meet, as they should. Hence 
the poles cannot be_represented. Note how the spaces 
representing equal differences of latitude get larger 
and larger, indicating a great stretching polewards. 
. 7 . * 
This rapidly increases as points nearer the pole are pro- 
jected, while the pole itself can only be projected at 
infinity. Also note that the polar regions are stretched 
out east and west as long as the equator, again a tremen- 
dous distortion. The Mercator projection, then, greatly 
exaggerates the higher latitudes in all directions, which, 
of course, increases their area unwarrantably. The 
extent of polar distortion is well seen by comparing 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
CARTOGRAPHY 191 
Greenland with South America on a Mercator map, and 
then again on a globe map. In the Mercator map it is 
represented larger than South America. In Fig. 14 the 
globe map of North America is represented thrown 
radially on the surface of the cylinder. The resultant 
stretching is evident from a comparison of the two 
maps. 
In spite of this tremendous distortion the Mercator 
projection has its m The regions nearest the line 
of tangency of the globe and cylinder, the equator, are 
represented with fair accuracy. On the equator every- 
thing is placed in exactly the same relations as on the 
globe) for here projection and globe coincide. For 
points near the equator there is not much deviation from 
the truth. For a latitude embracing the tropics and 
most of the temperate belts, that is, the most inhabited 
part of the globe, the distortion is not unendurable. 
This projection is also called the central-cylindrical. 
Unmodified, this projection requires maps unduly long 
from north to south. Various arbitrary modifications 
have been devised to reduce the distortion in the higher 
latitudes. It was Mercator’s distinction to invent a 
plan by which the distortion in longitude is kept equal 
to that in latitude. ‘The result is that the Mercator 
projection gives the correct compass bearings of places 
with reference to each other. That is, what is shown 
directly east or southeast of New York City, for example, 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
192 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
is really east or southeast. Hence this projection is 
much used for sailing charts for mariners. 
Another advantage of this map is that it presents 
the whole world at once to view, which is very useful in 
studies of distribution over the world of physical features, 
such as heat belts, isotherms, winds, rainfall, ocean cur- 
rents, etc. ; and for other distribution studies, such as that 
ofraces, resources, industries, crops, commercialroutes, etc. 
It is to be regretted, however, that it is used so much in

It goes without saying that such maps should never be 
used for the first study of the shapes of the continents.

twice that of the globular and the parallels are not 
curved. This represents both hemispheres of the 
earth in one view, with the advantage over Mercator’s 
projection in that areas are on the same scale throughout 
(hence it is also called equal-area projection), and shows 
comparatively little distortion of shape. This is being 
used considerably in recent books. It is a good pro- 
jection where a comparison of areas is desirable, as in 
studies of distribution of natural resources, etc. The 
designer of this method was Mollweide, 1805. 
The conic projection is similar to Mercator’s, except 
that a tangent cone is used instead of a cylinder. When

Obviously this projection has limitations like the last, 
though somewhat different. The region at the line of

modifications. One of much merit is the polyconic.

near the line of tangency of the globe and the cone. If, 
now, instead of a single cone, a series of superimposed 
cones be used, each tangent to the globe at a different 
latitudé, more such fairly accurate portions of the map 
may be obtained. The polyconic projection, in general, 
embodies this principle. Hassler (d. 1843), of the United 
States Coast and Geodetic Survey, devised this method. 
This is an excellent projection for representing large 
 
-P-A-G-E-208

areas, such as continents. On such maps the meridians 
are not straight, but curve toward each other. The 
parallels are not quite concentric, but spread apart 
somewhat toward the margins of the map. The ad- 
vantage of this map is that it shows very little distortion 
for the larger areas, except a little at the margins of the 
map. The same scale 
can be used for all parts 
of the map and in all 
directions, except at 
the periphery. It is 
reasonably accurate for 
a width of 4o degrees 
of latitude.

North America, for ex- 
ample, should be pictured as shown in this projection, 
and not as in the Mercator. The simple conic projec-

their own meridians and parallels. 
Modified projections. — As a matter of fact, in actual 
cartography the projections are not made as above indi- 
cated. Tables have been computed for measuring off 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
CARTOGRAPHY 197 
the parallels and meridians, and many such tables are 
greatly modified from the geometrical requirements of 
the projections in order to suit the exigencies of the shape 
of the page or chart, and some are juggled very arbitrarily 
indeed. There are many different ways of making the 
polyconic projection. As an instance of the scientific 
juggling, note the Mercator projection. 
There are very many other projections, each with 
claims for general or special purposes. But the above 
are the ones most commonly seen in school maps. 
The teacher should be aware of the errors and limita- 
tions of maps, and also of the advantages and possibil- 
ities WA 
The data for maps. —A map presupposes a survey 
of some sort. The cartographer uses the data given 
him by explorers, sailors, travelers, and others, in the 
construction of hismap. The correctness of the map evi- 
dently rests upon the accuracy of these eyewitnesses; on 
the exactness of their instruments and methods of meas- 
urement and computation of distance, time, elevation, 
latitude, longitude, etc.; on the thoroughness and extent 
of their exploration and investigation ; on their knowledge 
of the natural conditions and resources; and on their 
general truthfulness and reliability. The human judg- 
ment is not infallible, hence maps are constantly under- 
going modifications, revision, and refinement as previous 
mistakes are discovered, or new data are added. A 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
198 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
glance at the earliest and latest map of North America 
well shows this progress. 
Records of discoveries. — Explorers, like Stanley, 
Sven Hedin, or Peary, in traversing a new region, 
keep notes of their observations, and also estimate or 
measure distances, note compass bearings, determine 
latitude and longitude (location), and generally make 
sketch maps of their journeyings. 
The earliest explorers simply follow the coasts or 
rivers of the newly discovered lands. The Hinterland, 
or the region farther inland, is then penetrated later, 
often in connection with commercial development. 
In this way, the maps which were first largely blanks, 
are gradually filled in as the necessary data are collected. 
Government surveys. — There are, however, more 
scientific and systematic surveys than these reconnais- 
sance records of discoverers, explorers, and commercial 
agencies. Nearly all’of the most enlightened govern- 
ments have made very accurate surveys of their coastal 
lines and interiors. The United States Coast and 
Geodetic Survey is for such a purpose. This survey 
determines with refined instruments the latitude and 
longitude of the salient points; computes distances 
and areas mathematically from very accurately measured 
base-lines (usually segments of a meridian) by the method 
known as triangulation, in which even the earth’s curva- 
ture is taken into account; elevations or contours are 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
CARTOGRAPHY 199 
taken with delicate leveling instruments; the minor 
irregularities of the coast line are laid out by compass, 
and are measured with tape; and the depths of the 
navigable waters are sounded. 
The United States Geological Survey is also an 
accurate survey to note, especially, the topography, 
mineral resources, hydrography, and .other data. The 
country is surveyed in sections, called rectangles, over 
every mile of which surv s and geologists actually 
travel. re 
“ Survey of public lands. — The United States Public 
Domain, that is, the old Northwest Territory, acquired 
as the result of the Revolutionary W; r, and other 
acquisitions since then, is all surveyed by the United 
States Land Office surveyors, preliminary to free dis- 
posal, or sale to settlers. The system in use was de- 
vised by General Rufus Putnam, of Revolutionary 
fame. The first step is to select, determine, and “ run ” 
a standard meridian by the solar compass, and a base- 
line or standard parallel at right angles thereto (Fig. 22). 
Then guide meridians and other standard parallels 
are run parallel to the first, at distances of twenty-four 
miles. The twenty-four mile squares are then sub- 
divided into sixteen townships by means of minor 
meridians and parallels. Each township, six miles 
square, the political unit for some purposes, is further 
subdivided by means of north and south lines and east

goes. Any further subdivision is made by local officials. 
A section comprises one square mile, or 640 acres.

sections several hundred miles apart are compared, if 
nothing were done to prevent this. To correct for this 
convergence of the meridians, a new start is made at 
every fourth parallel, by again measuring off guide me- 
ridians every twenty-four miles east and west from a 
standard meridian. Such a parallel is known as a cor- 
rection-line. The meridians on opposite sides do not 
correspond, except at the principal meridian. 
City surveys for streets and lots are based upon the 
original United States Land Survey, but the surveys 
are made with much more care than for rural regions, 
owing to the value of real estate, and the danger of build- 
ings not being on property lines. 
Surveying is an ancient art. — Babylonian records 
show that land surveys were made there 4000 years ago. 
And in the ancient empire of the Nile, owing to the 
periodical oblitération of boundary marks by the flooding 
of the river, it was found necessary to appoint geom- 
eters, or surveyors, to relocate private claims. The 
Romans had a government land survey. But it is only 
in modern times that surveying has become an exact 
science. 
Maps made from surveys. —Sometimes the sur- 
veyor himself draws the map from his own measure- 
ments and records. At other times the data of a land 
survey are turned over to cartographers to compile 
into a map. 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
CARTOGRAPHY 203 
The cartographer decides upon and constructs his 
projection of meridians and parallels, and then by records 
of latitude and longitude puts in the salient features, and

Scale of maps. — In maps on the scale of an inch to 
the mile every creek and farmhouse can be shown. 
In town maps the scale is often 20 inches to the mile. 
In maps of —*— (the ratio to actual, natural dimen- 200,000 
sions), a common scale for wall maps of the smaller 
areas on large scale, only the larger irregularities of 
the coast, the larger streams, and the more important 
townscan be shown. A map of North America on this 
scale would have to be about 144 feet wide and 166 
feet long. A map of this:continent as usually shown 
in the school books, 8 by 10 inches, is on the scale 
of about 1: 40,000,000. Compare Figs. 25, 26, 27, and 
28. 
Mechanical process of making a map. — The map is 
first drawn by hand. It may be reproduced by pho- 
tography on a zinc plate which is then etched, and from 
this an engraving is made. The map is sometimes made 
from a copper plate etching. Colored maps are usually 
printed with lithographic stone or lithographic zinc 
plates, some with many colors necessitating the same 
number of printings. The cost of making a map in an 
ordinary school atlas may run from fifty to a hundred 
dollars. Cartography has developed from its earlier 
crude processes to a highly specialized science and a 
beautiful art.

Significance. — Many names on the map are full of 
significance if their etymology and origin are known. 
It adds interest and pleasure to the dull study of place 
geography to discover such meanings. It should be the 
aim of the teacher to explain, when possible and when 
profitable, the names of countries, cities, rivers, moun- 
tains, etc. Such meanings may add interesting geo- 
graphical facts, or historical or other important associa- 
tions, the knowledge of which would enliven and enrich 
the study, and often would tend to keep the facts in 
remembrance. 
The etymology of many geographical names may be 
found in any complete dictionary. Isaac Taylor’s 
Names and their Histories is an excellent reference for the 
names of Great Britain and Europe, and Bul. 197, United 
States Geological Survey, The Origin of Certain Place 
Names in the United States, by Gannett, for this country. 
205 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
206 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Geographical names often go back into antiquity far 
beyond the era of historic record. In fact, for some 
historic and ethnographic studies the geographic names 
of a region are the only clew. Thus it has been said 
that geographic names are fossil history. 
It must be remembered that many of these names have 
suffered much change, by mispronunciation, misspelling, 
mistranslation, by a gradual change of meaning of roots, 
by abbreviation, or by mere degradation; also that the 
etymology of many such names cannot be determined 
with positiveness, and that there is much difference of 
opinion among authorities regarding derivations. In 
spite of this element of doubt, which is especially im- 
portant in considering the prehistoric names, fairly good 
assurance may be felt.about the etymology and signifi- 
cance of geographical names in general, particularly con- 
cerning the names in the newer countries, where the 
historic or physiographic reasons for the name are still 
quite apparent. 
The first geographical names were probably those of 
landmarks, such as rivers, mountains, etc., and were 
used by primitive man in his wanderings. They were 
usually nouns, simply signifying the feature, such as 
don (river), loch (lake), ben (peak), sometimes, as to-day, 
coupled with an adjective prefix or suffix. It is remark- 
able how persistent these old names are, particularly those 
of rivers and mountains, lasting to the present day. Thus 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES 207 
Celtic roots persist in various parts of Europe from which the Celts passed away in prehistoric days. This race was probably one of the first, impelled by love of adventure and conquest, or crowding at home, to emerge from Asia. Celtic names occur all over southern and central Europe. The Celts had several root words for running water, —avon, dur, wysg, and don being modern Celtic-Welsh forms. These are believed to occur in the names of many European Streams, as the Ofanto in Italy, the Inn in Germany, the Rhine (ren-avon, swift water), the Seine (sen-avon, slow river), the Garonne, and several Avons in England. The root wysg occurs in the Welsh word Meaning stream, in the English Esk, Usk, Ouse, Oxford, and even in the Thames (tam eisis, broad river); and in the continental Aix, Weser, Wisbach, and others, The root dur js found in the Doura in Spain. 
In the same way the extent of the incursion of each wave of migration, the Greek, the Roman, Teutonic, Slavonic, and Saracen may be seen in the names of the map of Europe. 
When a conquering race came into a land previously peopled they retained many of the names given to phys- ical features by the aborigines, as may be seen by the great retention of Indian names in the New World. The later names in the older countries are those of cities and states. The first races of Europe had no 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
208 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
settled habitation, or definite tribal boundaries. It is 
this class of names that are especially full of historic 
meaning. The various racial invasions, for example 
those into England, as also the different periods of settle- 
ment in America, are thus well marked by superimposed 
sets of names. 
Names in Great Britain. 1. Celtic. —The remnants 
of the Celts are represented in the British Isles by the 
Trish, the Welsh, and the Highland Scotch. At one 
time they extended over all England. The ancient 
Britons, whom Cesar partly conquered, 55 8-C:, were 
Celtic. Their names are found in England and Scotland. 
The numerous Avons as stream names are examples. 
It is redundancy to speak of the River Avon. Other 
Celtic names appear for river (see above). 
Dun (don) is the word for a hill, usually fortified: 
This is a common name on the map of Great Britain, as 
Dundee, Dumfries, the Downs (dunes, hills); and 
London (lyn, a pool, and dun, hill-fort), which dates 
back more than two thousand years. 
2. The Romans left their impress on the English map 
in the various Chest2rs (castra, & fortified camp), — 
Chester, Chichester, Dorchester, Winchester, Leicester, 
Worcester, etc. 
2 Saxon.—The geography of the next invaders, the 
Saxons, is indicated by many place names ending in 
tun (ton), a farm inclosure, or village ; and names end- 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES 209 
ing in ham, home, farm village, as Aelfredston, Bilston, 
Darloston, Boston, Norton (Northtown), Easton, Sutton 
(Southtown), Weston, Merton (town by the sea); 
Walsingham, Cheltenham, Oldham, West Ham, etc. 
The termination burgh (burg, borough, bury), a fortified 
town, is also Saxon and appears in Salisbury, Peter- 
borough, Shrewsbury, Bury St. Edmunds, Glastonbury, 
Canterbury, Bury. It is evident that some of these 
places were named after people, as in the case of Jones- 
ville or Smithtown to-day. 
4. When the Danes came they brought with them the 
names by, a town, and thorpe, a village, which we see 
attached to several English towns, — Appleby, Whitby, 
Derby (by the water), Rugby (Rockville), Althorp and 
Winthorp. 
5. Norse. — The English and Scottish coast is dotted 
with towns ending in mess, nose, headland, as Skeg- 
ness, Sheerness in England, and Inverness and Caithness 
in Scotland. The Naze, Oxfordness, and Dungeness are 
still used as names for capes. These names were given 
by the plundering Norsemen or Vik-ings (from vik, a 
creek, inlet, or bay on the Scandinavian coast). From 
vik are derived the many towns ending in wick or wich, 
as Wick, Berwick, Norwich, Ipswich, Sandwich (Sandy 
Creek), Greenwich, all towns on the coast or on rivers 
near the mouth, except a few like Warwick, which is 
inland. The English word yard is garth in Norse, in 
Pp 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
210 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
which it means an inclosed or fortified place. From ‘this 
come Fishguard and Applegarth. 
Thus is history written on the map. 
The map names of America should be of particular 
interest to American pupils. The non-Indian names are 
of so recent origin, and historically so well established, 
that their meaning and form have changed but little, 
and their interpretation is therefore less liable to 
error. 
1. Indian.—The Indian aborigines lived on both con- 
tinents as numerous scattered tribes in more or less 
permanent sections or domains. The American race 
is usually ascribed to the Mongolian stock. The tribes 
have a common root language, but many dialects have 
developed in different regions. This is shown by a 
study of the names of various parts of North America. 
In the Northwest are the ugly-sounding Aleut names, 
like Alaska, Skagway, Yakutat, Kadiak, Sitka, Kutlik, 
etc. The western United States coast tribes had better 
sounding ones: Tacoma (the highest, near heaven), 
Wallula and Willamette (Wallamet, running water), 
Shasta (a tribe of Indians), Tuolumne. The Indians 
of the Basin, the Shoshone group, are represented by 
Shoshone, Winnemucca, Utah (the mountain), Idaho 
(gem of the mountains). The fierce Sioux tribes had 
names like Dakota (allies), Iowa (sleepy ones), Missouri 
(muddy water), Nebraska (shallow water), Kansas (wil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES 211 
lows), Omaha (up-stream), Topeka (a good place to dig 
potatoes), Oklahoma (home for all Indians). The Al- 
gonquin tribes of the Ohio Valley and the Upper Great 
Lakes gave us Minnesota (much or cloudy water), 
Minnehaha (laughing water), Michigan (big lake), 
Illinois (a tribe), Ohio (beautiful river), Wisconsin 
(rushing water), Chicago (skunk cabbage), Kalamazoo, 
Sheboygan, Erie (wild cat tribe), Allegheny (the fairest 
river), Kentucky (the prairies). The mighty Iroquois 
tribes of the Lower Great Lakes and the Hudson gave us 
Ontario (beautiful lake), Mohawk (muskrat), Genesee, 
Cayuga (long lake), Oswego (broad valley), Niagara 
(neck or strait; thundering water), Manhattan (of 
doubtful origin, some authorities giving it as “little 
island ’”’; others, as “ the place of drunkenness,” refer- 
ring to Verrazano’s carousal with the Indians). The 
Indians of the Gulf region had the mellifluous, allitera- 
tive Tallahassee (old town), Chattanooga (eagle’s 
nest), Alabama (the clearing), Mississippi (father of 
the waters), Natchez, Altamaha, Appalachicola, Okifi- 
nokee, and Appalachian (near the sea). The names of 
Mexico are largely Aztec, — Mexico (home of the god of 
war), Mazatlan, Tepic, Zacetecas, Popocatapetl, Tlax- 
cala, and Tehauntepec. 
Many Indian names are translated literally, — Big 
Stone Lake, Spearfish, Red Cloud, Pipestone, Red 
Lodge, Medicine Lodge, etc. Also many through 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
212 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
mispronunciation, mistranslation, or degradation have 
but slight resemblance to their originals in the Indian 
language. Thus Ouachita (buffalo country) has _be- 
come Wichita. 
The names of half the states are Indian, the majority 
of the rivers of the Mississippi System and the Eastern 
states, most of’ our lakes, and legions of counties, town- 
ships, and cities. These names will persist long after 
the Indian has ceased to exist as a separate tribal 
entity, and will be historic evidence of the once continen- 
tal sway of the Red Man. Practically all these names 
had some significance, even to the Whites, at first, re- 
ferring chiefly to physical features, but they are already 
being used generally without understanding. Neverthe- 
less, they are still interesting on account of their alien 
origin, their alliterative or musical sound, and the 
piquancy of their forgotten meaning. 
2. Spanish. — The succession of explorers and im- 
migrants in America is plainly marked on the map. 
First came the Spaniards, who together with their 
spoliation of the Aztecs and other Indians combined a 
certain religious zeal and devotion attested by the many 
sacred names they bestowed on their discoveries and 
domains: San Salvador (so named by Columbus in 
gratitude for his deliverance from the dangers of his 
first voyage), San Juan Bautista (St. John the Baptist), 
St. Augustine, San Antonio, Corpus Christi (Body of 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES 213 
Christ), San Diego, Los Angeles (La puebla de la Nuestra 
Senora la Reina de Los Angeles, the city of Our Lady, the 
Queen of the Angels, was the lengthy original title), San 
José, Santa Maria, San Francisco, Sacramento (the 
sacrament). The name California was given after 
the name of a fabled isle of precious stones in a Spanish 
novel popular at that time. Many Spanish names refer 
to some physical characteristic of the place. The 
numerous Salinas speak of the salt deposits in that arid 
zone (Arizona). El Paso is The Pass (Ute Pass) between 
the Rockies of the United States and the Sierras of 
Mexico. The groves of cottonwoods (Alamedo, Alamo) 
and white oaks (Albuquerque), and the “fertile plain” 
(Las Vegas), were grateful oases in this land of drought. 
The Spanish name for mountain is Sierra (a saw), and 
thus we have Sierra Nevada (white). Colorado means 
red, and Rio, river (Rio Grande). 
3. French.—The trail of the Frenchmen leads from 
the St. Lawrence to Lake Superior, and from there 
down the Mississippi to New Orleans. They got along 
more amicably with the Indians than did the English, 
and as lonely traders and still lonelier missionaries 
they paddled their birch canoes up the larger streams, 
and on the Great Lakes, and carried them over the 
portages, or around falls and rapids. They lived in the 
Big Woods in savage teepees, cut off from civilization 
by a thousand miles of wilderness. 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
The French, also, showed their piety in a religious 
nomenclature of places, of which St. Lawrence, St. 
Anthony Falls, Sault (falls) St. Marie, St. Paul, St. 
Louis, are examples. Detroit (a strait), Fond du Lac 
(end of the lake), and Prairie du Chien (prairie dog) are 
French. Unlike their Anglo-Saxon brethren the French 
did not give their own names to their discoveries. Their 
modesty has been rewarded by later generations naming 
in their honor many spots along the old French routes 
of discovery, — Champlain, Marquette, Duluth, Joilet, 
La Salle, Hennepin, Le Sueur, etc. 
4. English.— Next came the English occupation 
with a great blanket of English names. 
(a) Religious names.—The Puritans, who came 
to avoid religious persecution, and to live their lives in 
accordance with their beliefs, showed their fervor also in 
giving religious names, —Salem (Jerusalem), Providence, 
Concord. And of a later date are the many Bethels, 
Bethlehems, Jordans, Zions, Zion Cities, Lebanons, 
Canaans, Shilohs, Goshens, Carmels, Tabors, etc. 
(6) Royal names.— The Puritans were always in- 
clined to be rather independent and democratic ; but their 
Cavalier cousins south of the Mason and Dixon Line 
were more friendly to the king and the nobility. In 
the North we find few names in honor of royalty or the 
nobles, but in the South we have Virginia (Queen Eliza- 
beth), the Carolinas and Maryland (after Charles I and 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES 215 
his queen), Georgia (George II), Charleston (Charles II), 
Jamestown (James I), Annapolis (wife of James I), 
Elizabeth City, Va., Georgetown, Baltimore, Delaware. 
Albany and New York (Duke of Albany, Duke of York, 
later James II) are examples in the North. 
(c) European repetitions.—Isaac Taylor thinks 
that English names are uninteresting and prosaic, and 
do not generally show appreciation of natural beauty. 
Be that as it may, they must have been treasured in the 
hearts of the emigrants, who on coming to the new coun- 
try still paid homage to the mother country by repeat- 
ing them onthe American map. So we have in New Eng- 
land and elsewhere the names of Plymouth, Boston, 
Bath, Portland, Exeter, Portsmouth, Dover, Manchester, 
Lynn, Cambridge, Gloucester, Worcester, Springfield, 
Northampton, Northfield, Norwich, New London, Dan- 
bury, New Haven, New Britain, Windsor, Reading, 
Chester, etc., all good old English place names. The 
names of some eighty English towns thus suffice for a 
thousand American places. 
The same thing was done by the Dutch in New Neth- 
erlands, New Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Flushing, and 
Brooklyn; by the. Swedes in New Sweden (Delaware) ; 
by the Germans in Hanover, Berlin, New Ulm, Frankfort, 
etc. All these borrowed or second-hand place names 
have no special fitness or significance, except that they 
reveal the cosmopolitan sources of our immigrants, and 
their Heimweh or love for the old home. 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
216 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Curiosities in geographical nomenclature are the nu- 
merous names taken from classic history, even mythol- 
ogy. A one-time surveyor-general of the state of New 
York, an admirer of the Ancients, was responsible for the 
names of Troy, Utica, Syracuse, Rome, Ithaca, Pal- 
myra, Corinth, Marcellus, Camillus, and Athens which 
appear on the map of the state. These names have 
been much repeated in other states, with others added. 
We have Cairo and Memphis reproduced on the Missis- 
sippi; Carthage, Hannibal, Cincinnati, and Alexandria. 
From mythology are taken Olympia and Pheenix; 
and we have the Eureka of Archimedes many times. 
Philadelphia may be added as a happy invention on 
the classic model. 
5. Native.— But Americans have coined or in- 
vented a host of names for themselves, repeating the 
practice all over the world in all ages. 
(a) Descriptive.—Just as in prehistoric times the 
Phoenicians named a rocky islet Tyre (Heb. Tsor, a 
rock), so in most recent times the most natural way of 
naming a place is by reference to some physiographic 
feature. Thus we have Little Falls, Portage, Lockport, 
Niagara Falls City, Atlantic City, Ocean Grove, Sulphur 
Springs, Lake City, El Paso, River Falls, Iron Mountain, 
Grand Rapids, Detroit, Terre Haute (High Ground), 
South Bend, Rockford, Salt Lake City, Death Valley, 
Butte (an abrupt peak), Little Rock, Hot Springs, 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES 217 
Montana (mountainous), Maine (“the mayn land”), 
Rhode Island (from a roode Eylandt, red island, in the 
Bay), Rocky Mountains, Bad Lands, etc. 
Many names contain adjectives or phrases descriptive 
of the beauty of the place: Fairview, Belleview, Buena 
Vista (good view), Bellaire (good air), Greenfield, Ever- 
green, Point Pleasant, Eau Claire (clear water), etc. 
Many rivers are named after the color of their waters, 
as Red, Green, White, and Black; and mountains have 
ever been thus called, as the Blue Mountains, the Green 
Mountains (hence Vermont), the White Mountains, the 
Black Hills, etc. 
(6) Biological.—Another large class of American 
names are biological, indicating the kind of animals, 
trees, or other vegetation that once abounded in the 
vicinity, examples of which are Buffalo, Beaver Dam, 
Bear River, Big Horn Mountains, Snake River, Goose 
Lake, Pelican Rapids, Eagle City, Musselshell River, 
Eel River, Cape Cod, White Oaks, Albuquerque (white 
oaks), Cottonwood, Alamo (cottonwoods), Baton Rouge 
(red stick, cedar), Pine Bluff, etc. 
(c) Industrial.—Some American cities are named . 
after some natural resource, or the chief industry “ that 
has made them famous”: Farmingdale, Wheatland, Port 
Tobacco, Pomona (after the Goddess of Fruit), Olean, 
Oil City, Petrolia, Carbon, Carbondale, Minersville, 
Galena (lead ore), Leadville, Silver City, Golden, Glovers- 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
218 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
ville, Mechanicsburg, Linoleumville, Emporium, — not 
all that might be asked for a name always, but perhaps 
good advertising. 
(d) Biographical. —Another great class of cities in 
the United States have biographical names. Many are 
given in honor of presidents, governors, and other states- 
men, army and naval leaders, or other great men dear to 
the hearts of the people; and some have been given in 
admiration of foreign heroes or leaders, some of whom 
have rendered this country service. It is said that more 
cities and towns (65) are named after Franklin than after 
any other man. If, however, counties and townships, 
not to mention streets, are considered, Washington easily 
leads (320). Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Jack- 
son, Lincoln, Garfield, are great favorites. Lafayette, 
Steuben, Pulaski, Pitt, and other foreigners are honored. 
Seas, bays, straits, capes, and islands are often named 
after their discoverers or explorers, as, Vancouver 
Island, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Puget Sound. 
This feature is especially noticeable in the more recent 
discoveries of Australia, Polynesia, and the polar 
regions. 
The very name America came about in a similar way, 
though partially based on an error. Amerigo Vespucci, 
an Italian, made several voyages of exploration, following 
up and extending the work of Columbus, 1499-1503. He 
published the first printed account of the New World. 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES 219 
re was a German geographer, Waldseemiiller by 
name, in France, who wrote a Latin book in 1507, in 
which he said, ‘“‘ And the fourth part of the world having 
been discovered by Amerigo or Americus, we may call it 
Amerige or America,” thus overlooking the prior claims of 
Columbus. Dr. Penck suggests that the name America 
is not inappropriate, as the name Amerigo means grain 
(German, Emerich, Emmer). 
To make some amends the country discovered as a 
result of Columbus’ vision is poetically called Columbia, 
while we have the District of Columbia, and many places 
called Columbus or Columbia. 
If one turns to the map of the polar and sub-polar 
regions he sees the names of the men who braved isola- 
tion, hardship, c starvation, and death in quest of the 
Northwest Passage, or the Polar Goal. Hudson’s Bay 
reminds us of the pathetic story of the fate of this dis- 
coverer, cast adrift with his son in a small boat by his 
mutinous crew. After him, also, we have Hudson’s 
Strait and the Hudson River. In the Arctic waters we 
find the names of Davis, Baffin, Ross, Frobisher, Behring, 
Franklin, Peary, and others. 
(e) Proprietary.—Besides the many places named 
deservedly in honor of great men, there are in this coun- 
try a host of cities and towns named after unhistoric 
personages, perhaps an early settler, a great landowner 
who owned the town site, a leading manufacturer, a 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
financier, or perhaps only a politician. Every one is 
familiar with such names as Evansville, Stevenspoint, 
Harrisburg, Youngstown, Brownsville, Barnesville, 
Greenville, Pottstown, Smithtown, etc. It is these 
names that irritated Matthew Arnold, and our own Emer- 
son, because of their prosaic character and monotonous 
repetition. But they represent a very natural method 
of naming a place, and one which has been practiced by 
all races. In England the many hams, tons, burgs, 
burys, fields, and bys are for the most part composed of 
these roots combined with family names. In Europe most 
places have existed beyond the memory of man, and such 
patronymics excite no question. Here, however, the 
commonplace character of Smith of Smithsville, or of Mr. 
Potts of Pottstown is still fresh in mind, and therefore 
less romantic. 
(f) Frontier types.—As a contrast to the eupho- 
nious classic names are the appellations given by our pio- 
neers, hunters, cowboys, miners, and lumberjacks, names 
less polite, yet decidedly expressive and appropriate at 
the time given. ‘Thus, Stranger, Deadman’s Creek, 
Three Devils, Bonanza, Jimtown, Roundup, Stampede, 
Gin Flat, Eight-mile, Hog Ranch, Billy Creek, etc. 
Some of these destined to grow into importance become 
ashamed before the world of their humble name and 
origin, and petition the legislatures to change their 
name to something more orthodox. 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES 221 
Application in teaching.— The mature student of 
geography finds in the meaning and origin of geographical 
names much of interest. While the teacher in the ele- 
mentary school cannot apply such linguistic and historic 
studies directly, she may give the pupils now and then 
a translation, if profitable, and may to a certain extent 
make the children feel that names do represent history, 
race, and language; and that many of the names on the 
map are truly descriptive of geographical conditions. 
Tracing the meanings of names is one of the profitable and 
legitimate pastimes of geography.
-P-A-G-E-234
CHAPTER XVIII 
THE GEOGRAPHY OF INDUSTRY AND COM- 
MERCE 
A distinct phase of geography.— So much of geography 
deals with industrial occupations and trade that in the 
high school and college it is differentiated as a separate 
branch under the name of Commercial Geography. 
Even in the upper grammar grades a special emphasis is 
often placed on this phase of the subject. So far as 
intrinsic interest, human importance, and rational unity 
are concerned, it deserves such distinction. In the ele- 
mentary school, it is, however, generally combined 
and blended with the other phases of the study. 
Commercial study in the primary course. — Industrial 
geography has the pedagogical advantage of dealing 
with human needs and human occupations. It springs 
out of the necessities and activities of the home. It 
is enacted in every shop, and is represented by the 
traffic of the street and by the shipping of the harbor. 
The child necessarily has considerable appreciation, 
from observation and experience, of the industrial 
life of the community. Home geography extends this 
knowledge by a more thorough study of familiar, typical 
22 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
    
GEOGRAPHY OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE 223 
industries and teaches a few general relations, such as the 
sources of commodities, division of labor, raw material 
and finished goods, buyer and seller, exports and imports, 
etc. 
In the “first round” of the world, in primary geogra- 
phy, these elementary notions are applied in a broad view 
of the conspicuous occupations of mankind in America and 
the rest of the world. Through this the pupil learns of 
modificationsof methodsemployed in his own community, 
of entirely new industries, and something of the inter- 
dependence and interrelations of distant regions. He 
also begins to see that man’s occupations are determined 
by natural conditions of climate, location, resources, 
ete, 
The approach in the lower grades should be, pref- 
erably, from the human side. The industry should be 
considered more as an outcome of human interest or 
need, than as a causation by physical nature. The point 
of view should be, What do the people do for a living? 
rather than, What is the effect of nature on man’s 
mode of life? The latter treatment may be reserved 
for the higher grades. 
An industry should be studied somewhat intensively, 
and as concretely or graphically as possible. It should be 
an important, typical industry. 
One and a half pages out of the four on New England, 
in Dodge’s Elementary Geography, are devoted to com-

mercial matters; and Tarr and McMurry’s New Geog- 
raphy, First Book, gives ten out of the eleven pages on 
the same section. These data are given to show the vary: 
ing importance attached to commercial geography in 
the lower grades. 
An example: Study of a ranch.—In the following 
illustration taken from an elementary text, note the pre- 
ponderance of the human element. Even the title 
sounds better to a child than “ A Study of the Cattle 
Industry.” 
example, but if all the primary geographies were as This is, no doubt, a somewhat extreme 
well adapted to the interests of children, the subject 
would find greater popularity. 
A RANCH 
There is a belt of high plateau land east of the Rocky Mountain 
foot-hills, stretching from Texas to North Dakota, which has very 
little rain, not enough to make grain growing profitable, and so it 
is devoted to grazing. Where the buffalo once fed in countless 
numbers now graze thousands of cattle... . No hay is equal to 
these grasses, dried where they stand, and waiting to be nibbled 
through the winter months. 
But sometimes the cattle are in immense herds, and 
feed upon great tracts of unfenced land, where it is necessary 
for men to watch and care for them. These herders are called 
cowboys. 
The cowboys almost live in the saddle. They wear overalls 
of leather and wide-brimmed hats, carry large revolvers and use 
big spurs on their long boots. They endure rough fare, hard work, 
and all kinds of exposure to the weather... . 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
GEOGRAPHY OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE 225 
The cowboy learns to throw the lasso or rope with great skill, 
for he practices from boyhood. The rope is usually made of 
leather or grass and is about forty feet long, with a noose at one 
end, six feet or more in length. The coils of the rope are held in 
the left hand, and the noose is swung around the head with the 
right, and then forward and over the head or around the feet of 
the animal to be caught. . . . 
Cowboys are skillful riders. . . . 
In summer the cowboy rides all day among his cattle to see 
that they do not stray too far from good feed and water. Toward 
night he drives them to the bedding ground. . . . A few cowboys 
are on duty to watch them. Wild cattle are easily frightened at 
night ; then they jump to their feet and start to run away... . 
As different cattle look much alike, it is necessary for the 
owner to have his initials or some private mark on every animal in 
order toproveownership. ... Thesemar r brands, are written 
on the hides of the living animals with a hot iron fora pen... . 
The round-ups take place in the autumn and spring. The 
cowboys come together from long distances, each one knowing 
not only his own brand, but that of many neighbors. All the 
cattle ina certain section . . . are driven to one central place. .. . 
A man rides among them, and when he sees a cow or a steer with 
his own brand upon it, he runs it out of the herd to a second man 
who holds it. 
A well-trained horse is a great help in doing this. Many of the 
best horses for ranch business are bred in Texas... . The Texas 
ponies are small, but tough, quick, and very intelligent. Some 
of them are docile and willing, but others are apt to “buck.” 
When a horse bucks. . . 
When the cattle are full-grown they are sent by rail to the stock- 
yards of Kansas City or Chicago, where they are turned into 
meat, which is shipped to all parts of the country. You owe the 
roast beef you have for dinner to the grass that grows on the far- 
off ranches and the labor of the hard-worked cowboys. 
Q 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
    
226 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
A more intensive study of commercial geography is 
made in upper grades. The degree of detail of treatment 
varies with the author, and with the times. In the 
books of several generations ago very little was said on 
this subject. The present is an intensely commercial 
age, and the business world is continually crying for a 
commercial education. This demand has been met more 
or less by some textbooks of geography. 
Authors are not, by any means, agreed as to how far 
to go into the biology of commercial plants and animals, 
or the technique of culture and manufacture, or the de- 
tails of commerce. For example, Frye gives about ten 
words to the subject of Irrigation; Dodge, 90; Redway 
and Hinman, about 100; King, 1300; Tarr and Mc- 
Murry, 1700. This applies to advanced geography in 
each case. The variation is in part due to the different 
demands at different times, and partly to the author’s 
judgment. 
Type studies.—Some authors believe that the 
description of the cotton plant, for example, does not 
properly belong to geography, but to nature-study or 
botany; that the technical processes of a flour mill, or 
the details of a railroad business, are not geographical. 
It is probable, however, that such correlations of science, 
or trade technique, etc., will be generally regarded proper 
in the treatment of a limited number of type studies of in- 
dustries, for the purpose of geographical unity. 
   
-P-A-G-E-239
GEOGRAPHY OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE 227 
The balance between physical and commercial geog- 
raphy and the other human phases of the subject varies 
also according to the author’s training and predilections. 
Yet practically all recent writers give a large proportion 
to commercial geography. Thus for the New England 
states Frye’s Grammar School Geography gives nearly 
two out of three pages to commercial geography ; King’s 
Advanced Geography, twelve out of fourteen; Dodge’s 
Advanced Geography, six out of nine; Tarr and Mc- 
Murry’s New Advanced Geography, Second Book, eleven 
and a half out of sixteen. 
In advanced geography much more can be done with 
the study of the relations of the industries, not only to 
each other, but also to the natural environment on which 
they depend; and certain laws can be shown to underlie 
the industrial and commercial activities of man. The 
causal treatment lends itself well to commercial geog- 
raphy. Asarule, the causal sequence — location, topog- 
raphy, climate, resource, industry — should be followed. 
This sequence is usually well marked, and pupils should 
learn to use it as a principle of study. 
To appreciate these broad connections of commercial 
geography requires some maturity. The economic 
aspects of natural science and geography do not appeal 
greatly to younger minds, neither do the relations of 
things. But in the grammar grades the interest in such 
study is fairly well developed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
228 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Commercial geography, to be appreciated as a unit, 
also requires a good general knowledge of the map of 
the earth, climates, and peoples, which is another reason 
for not pressing this subject in the lower grades. 
Eurther, commercial geography is almost inextricably 
blended with history, sociology, and economics, of which 
the older pupils, even, have inadequate knowledge. 
The relegation of commercial geography in this wider 
sense to the upper grades makes it possible to employ 
certain methods ofinstruction. In the first place, it may 
be studied more intensively. The great industries and - 
commercial agencies may be studied as types in consid- © 
erable detail (see Chapter X 
Such a study requires a text of the completer sort, 
or else the use of supplementary readers, reference work, 
or classroom development by the teacher. In this way a 
thorough description of the industry is given, providing 
not merely a few dry statistics, but some principles of 
industry in general, and stimulating the reason and the 
imagination. 
Type study of lumbering. — The following is taken 
from a recent textbook for upper grades. The industry 
is taken up after the map study, topography, glacial 
effects, and climate have been considered as a setting. 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
GEOGRAPHY OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE 229 
LUMBERING 
Extent of the forests. — In the days of the early settlers, most of 
New England was covered with forests, and one of the first products 
sent back to England was lumber. Now the woods have been 
cleared away from much of the land, but where it is too steep or 
too rocky for farming, large tracts of forest still remain. 
For instance, there are large tracts of land in northern Maine, 
New Hampshire and Vermont, as well as in parts of the three 
Southern States (New England), that are still covered with timber. 
Standing on the summit of Mount Katahdin, one sees only a vast 
wilderness of trees in all directions. The nearest cultivated land 
is twenty-five miles to the east, while the unbroken forest stretches 
away much farther to the north and west. 
Cutting of the timber. — Winter is the busy season for cutting 
timber in this wilderness, for the swamps, which are numerous, 
and in summer impassable, are then frozen. At that season, also, 
the snows have covered the bowlders and fallen trees, and made the 
surface level enough for sleds, loaded with logs, to be drawn 
through the woods. 
Usually fifty or more men are necessary to a logging camp. 
With axes in hand, they go through the woods chopping down all 
the trees large and sound enough for good lumber. The limbs are 
then chopped off, and the logs are dragged by horses to the banks of 
the nearest stream. 
Floating the logs to the mills. — When the snow melts in the 
spring, the cutting is over and another busy season begins. The 
ice on the river breaks up, the streams are swollen by the melting 
snows, and the logs are whirled off downstream in the swift current. 
Frequently, however, this flood of water is not sufficient to carry 
them. In such cases in order to provide more water, dams are 
placed across the streams, or at the outlet of lakes. When more 
water is needed, the dams are opened, and a flood is poured into 
the stream. In this way immense numbers of logs are floated, or 
“driven” downstream, forming what lumbermen calla “log drive.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
230 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
The work of driving logs is a very exciting one. The logs often 
run on to rocks and shoals; and, as soon as one gets caught, 
others are held back by it. If the “‘jam”’ is not speedily removed 
the entire stream may become blocked. Such a condition is 
called a “‘log jam,” and it is the business of the log drivers to 
prevent jams by freeing the logs that become thus lodged. 
Some of the logs are stopped near waterfalls, far upstream 
where they are sawed into boards, lath, shingles, etc.; but most of 
them are carried to sawmills as far down the river as the current 
will take them. 
Hardships of the lumberman’s — During the season for 
cutting, the men go forth early in the morning and work until 
late in the evening, eating and sleeping in log cabins. Their 
beds are broad shelves of rough boards, covered with boughs 
from the spruce and balsam trees; and the camp is often so small 
that they must lie side by side, with scarcely room to turn. There 
is much exposure, too. The men may suffer seriously from the 
cold, for it is often necessary to work when the temperature is far 
below zero. 
The work of preventing log jams brings even more exposure, 
for the workmen must frequently wade into the icy water, and 
ride upon the logs. One may often see a man carried along on a 
single log, clinging to it by means of the sharp es in his boots, 
balancing himself with a long pole. Now and then he must jump 
from log to log, as a squirrel springs from tree to tree. In this 
way the men are often wet from head to foot and may even be 
thrown into the water and drowned. So many hardships are 
connected with lumbering that a lumberman is said to become an 
old man after a few years of service. 
This account is illustrated with appropriate cuts. 
Surely the pupil reading it must at least get a sympa- 
thetic appreciation of this industry. 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
GEOGRAPHY OF INDU! YY AND COMMERCE 231 
Principles of commerce.—The simpler underlying 
principles of commerce should be taught. The specific 
examplesshould be analyzed to reveal them. The teacher 
should show how these principles recur again and again in 
other cases, till the pupil begins to look for them himself. 
In this way he will acquire a stock of working principles 
helpful not only in the continuation of the study, but 
also in appreciating and solving in later life the complex 
industrial and civic problems of modern society. 
These principles, like all others in the elementary school 
geography, should not be taught in the abstract or in 
a general way, but should be derived naturally from the 
study of concrete, specific examples of industry and trade 
relations. Neither should they all be presented in one 
lesson. Months, even years, may be taken to develop 
them all, but in the upper grammar grades they should be 
organized and reviewed, and considered more in the 
abstract. 
Among such principles should be the following: The 
needs of man, and how they are determined. The sources : 
of man’s resources, and how they depend on topography, 
climate, location, etc. Raw material and finished goods. 
Division of labor. Value of machinery. Effect of labor 
on cost. The law of supply and demand. How mar- 
kets are determined. Routes of commerce in relation to 
topography. The means of transportation and their 
relative cost. The telegraph and other means of com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-244

munication. The importance of good harbors. What 
constitutes a good harbor. The geographic causes of the 
location of cities. What decides the location of an 
industry. The laws of international trade. The tariff. 
Other governmental control in commerce. See also 
Chapter XX. 
Statistics. — Commercial geography necessarily deais 
with statistics of amounts of resources, values of manu- 
factures, railway mileage, and the like. It would be folly 
to require the pupil to retain these any great length of 
time, even if they could be memorized. No doubt 
there are a very few statistics of population, distance, 
etc., worth remembering. But for the most part it is 
neither wise nor profitable to memorize them. Statistics 
are presented to give some comparative ideas of the 
quantitative importance of the things to which they re- 
fer. They are mere stepping-stones, once used, to be 
forgotten, though the general notion they were to teach 
it may be necessary to retain. 
Statistics serve to show the relative values of our re- 
sources, manufactures, means of transportation, etc. 
They show whether our industries and commerce are 
progressing or declining. They serve to show our 
standing in comparison with other countries. 
It should be remembered that textbook statistics are 
often woefully behind the times. To be of any value, 
their date should be considered. The teacher should 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
GEOGRAPHY OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE 233 
try to get the later returns from other sources, census 
returns, government trade reports, yearly almanacs 
of newspapers, etc., if the statistics in the textbook are 
antiquated. 
General review of commercial relations. — In practi- 
cally all modern advanced geographies, and in some of 
the elementary texts, there are, after the study of the 
United States, or after the survey of the world, chapters 
often called General Review, or Comparative Review, 
which deal with a summary of the commercial data of 
the United States, and a comparison with other countries 
to show relative strength and the trend of international 
trade. 
Such a review serves not only as an organizing sum- 
mary, but through the comparison of country with 
country further facts of relative commercial strength, 
and principles of commerce, commercial routes, and 
means of communication are brought out. 
Observational basis of commercial geography. — As 
in other fields, observation and personal experience 
count for a great deal in the study of commercial geog- 
raphy. The subject should be made as practical as 
possible, taken out of the pedantry of the textbook, 
basing it wherever possible upon the real observations 
of the pupil. The local artisans, the factories, the traffic 
on the street, the shipping in the harbor, all can be used to 
render the subject real. Individual observations should 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
234 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
be encouraged, preliminary direct studies assigned, and 
occasionally safe and feasible visits made to factories 
and other industrial plants. 
A collection of commercial specimens is of great use. 
Foodstuffs, fabrics, building material, etc., in the raw 
and finished state, or showing stages of manufacture, 
are useful. It is not necessary to make a large collection. 
A few of the great staples to serve as types are sufficient. 
Pictures of all stages of industry and of trade are 
extremely desirable. Many excellent pictures may be 
obtained as advertising from commercial houses. There 
are a few school charts of the industries, but these are of 
foreign make, and are apt to show out-of-date methods. 
Some showing the primitive hand processes are good, 
however. Current popular journals contain a great 
wealth of up-to-date matter and pictures on many 
phases of our industrial life. 
Commercial maps. — It is an excellent plan for teach- 
ers to make rough sketch maps on the blackboard, or, 
better, on heavy paper, of the distribution of commercial 
products, trade routes, and the like. The pupils also 
should be required to draw commercial maps, generally 
on the printed outlines. One kind of map always ap- 
peals to the native instincts of children, the pictorial 
or realistic map, showing the distribution of commercial 
features by means of pictures or actual specimens pasted 
or fastened on the map. A mineral chart or agricultural 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
GEOGRAPHY OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE 235 
chart could thus be used to enlist the activities of each 
pupil in the class in the construction of a common 
map. It is a good exercise. 
Statistical diagrams. — The vast amounts of some re- 
sources, products, or manufactures, etc., are so incon- 
ceivable and meaningless that it is necessary to use some 
method to interpret them other than mere statistics. 
The usual device in many books of rectangles or squares 
of proportionate areas to represent the different quanti- 
ties is an excellent one, since it appeals to the eye and 
the reason better than numbers. The secondary device 
of using pictures of the things themselves represented, 
in proportionate sizes, appeals still more to the children. 
The circle with proportionate divisions is another good 
statistical device. 
Tabulation is helpful to the learner. If properly 
tabulated on the board or on charts, interesting relations 
which would not be seen otherwise may be shown. The 
articles of commerce may thus be classified, the relation 
between raw and finished goods shown, the source and 
markets indicated, etc. Pupils should be taught to 
make such tabulations themselves in order to better 
organize their knowledge.

236 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Supplementary literature.— There are many good 
supplementary readers pertaining to commercial prod- 
ucts, manufacturing processes, and trade. The classic 
F. G. Carpenter series of Geographical Readers, Cham- 
berlain’s series of How We Are Fed, Clothed, Sheltered, 
and How We Travel; F.O. Carpenter’s Foods and their 
Uses ; Rocheleau’s Geography of Commerce, — are all for 
the elementary school. The older pupils should be en- 
couraged to write short papers on what they have read 
on assigned topics. Current magazines, also, may be 
used to good advantage. 
“Research”? by pupils. —A very practical bit of 
“research ” by pupils is to visit shops, factories, ware- 
houses, docks, etc., to note the commodities there, and by 
questioning the people in charge, or from the tags and 
labels, learn of their source or destination. 
A class in New York City wrote letters to the big 
steamship companies, asking them to send the names of 
ten leading imports and ten leading exports handled by 
their companies, and then tabulated and had printed the 
results of their inquiry. 
Commercial news in newspapers. — Another good way 
of rendering this study vital is to read the daily papers 
for crop reports, commerce notes, shipping reports, 
etc. To read the following in the paper is much more 
interesting and real than to learn these facts from the 
musty statistics of some textbook.

CHAPTER 
INTENSIVE STUDY OF GEOGRAPHY 
In teaching geography one is confronted with a 
dilemma, — the necessity of giving a good view of the 
earth as a whole, and the importance of selecting and 
emphasizing the most vital topics for thorough study. 
The two problems are in a measure incompatible. The 
attempt to study a vast multitude of facts in a general 
course in geography necessarily leads to superficiality. 
On the other hand, singling out the most essential topics 
for more complete study teaches the geography of the 
earth in spots only, leaving too much a blank. 
The difficulty is usually solved by providing a general, 
avowedly superficial, course, covering the whole globe, 
for beginners, after they have finished home geography ; 
and for the upper grades a more thorough, detailed 
study of the same field, in which, however, certain great 
topics are singled out for a still more intensive treatment. 
(See Type Study, page 241.) 
By thus rapidly traversing the world twice, continent 
by continent, country by country, the pupil receives a 
fair general notion of the relations of the world as a 
whole. 
238 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
  
  INTENSIVE STUDY OF GEOGRAPHY 239 
Emphasis on geographical facts should be discriminat- 
ing.—The facts of geography are not all equally impor- 
tant, and should not be taught alike. Discrimination 
should be used. Some topics should receive much more 
attention than others. The geography of Japan is 
vitally important to the Japanese, but not to American 
children. To the latter the geography of America is 
most essential. To American pupils the geography of 
England is more important than that of Austria, for evi- 
dent historic and economic reasons. Climatic features 
are more important than earthquakes. The less vital 
topics may be judiciously slighted to save time for 
thorough study of the more essential. 
Therefore the lion’s share of the time is given to our 
own continent and the United States. It is absolutely 
necessary to do this for pedagogical, patriotic, historic, 
and economic reasons. 
When the pupils have first studied their own country, 
which they can understand the best, they have a standard 
of comparison, or a basis of interpretation, for the study 
of foreign parts. 
Within the study of the United States itself judgment 
must be used in the selection of the essential and the 
nonessential. 
The textbook as guide.— To a great extent this 
selection is made for the teacher by the author of the 
textbook, or by the syllabus, or course of study. Still 
   
-P-A-G-E-252
240 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
much remains for the teacher to decide. Also some of 
the textbooks do not keep the best balance of the 
subject. 
Geographical units. — Happily the older method of 
studying the country state by state after the same mo- 
notonous plan, and with much repetition about physical 
features and industries, and the like, is giving way to 
the more rational treatment by sections embracing groups 
of states comprising either physiographical regions, or 
commercial units, or both (see page 248). The North 
Atlantic states constitute such a well-defined, natural 
unit. By the map study each state gets sufficient indi- 
vidual attention. The description is then given for the 
group as a whole. The study would then take up these 
topics common to all of them: the irregular coast 
and its influence on the people, the mountainous charac- 
ter of the section, glaciation, scenic aspects, the lum- 
ber industry, the truck farms, the big cities, the water 
power, and the manufacturing industries (cotton, leather, 
etc.). The Appalachian portion provides mountain 
studies, coal and iron mines, oil and gas wells, great man- 
ufacturing cities. In the South Atlantic section are the 
balmy climate, cotton, semitropical fruits, the negroes. 
And so on across the continent, each region has its 
characteristic features, natural and human. 
It is these characteristic topics for the different 
sections that deserve especial attention. Each important

a rapid fall, but just enough slope has been given the ditch to allow 
the water to flow. Thus the ditch soon runs on a higher level than 
the river, and the land between it and the river is lower than the 
ditch. 
Water from the ditch may then be led out over these fields to 
irrigate them. For this purpose ditches branch off from the main 
canal, and each of these is divided and subdivided to supply farms 
along its course. When a field needs water, one of the smaller 
ditches is tapped and the field is flooded; or else the water is led 
into furrows a few feet apart. The method followed depends 
upon the kind of crop that is under cultivation. As there is danger 
that the supply of water may not last through the summer, res- 
ervoirs are built to store the water of the spring freshets, and 
when needed this is allowed to flow into the ditches. 
Of course such an arrangement is expensive, and each farmer 
must pay for his water at a certain rate, as each tenant of a house 
in a city pays for his water or gas. That a farmer can afford to 
pay for water, however, is well shown in this case; for on the 
upper side of the ditch, which cannot be reached by the water, 
the land is only fit for grazing, while on the lower side there are 
rich fields of grain, vegetables, and alfalfa. The latter, like 
clover and hay, is fed to stock. It is one of the most important 
crops in the arid regions, where there is much demand for fodder 
for cattle, hogs, sheep, and horses. 
Without irrigation, crops could not be grown in this vicinity. 
It would then be necessary to bring farm products from Kansas, 
Nebraska, and other states, a distance of several hundred miles. 
It is evident, therefore, that irrigation must have had a great 
influence on the settlement of the West. 
(Then follows a sketch of the Rocky Mountain states 
and Southwest, with the crops raised by means of irriga- 
tion, and the development of the important cities in these 
sections.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
244 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
The value of irrigation is well shown here (Southern Cali- 
fornia). Before irrigation was introduced into Southern Cali- 
fornia, this region could support very few people. Now, in Los 
Angeles and vicinity, there is a population of over two hundred 
thousand. 
The description of these few places serves to show the importance 
of irrigation in the West. It is not to be understood, however, 
that these are the only noted irrigated sections, for there are 
many others. Most of the largest and best known are along 
the large rivers. For example, irrigation is extensive along 
the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers and their tributaries in 
Montana; along the Snake River and its tributaries in Idaho; 
along the Yakima and other streams tributary to the Columbia 
River in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; along the Gila and Salt 
rivers in Arizona; along the Rio Grande and Pecos rivers in New 
Mexico; and along the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and other rivers 
in California... . 
The irrigation of Arizona deserves especial mention, partly 
because of the extensive irrigation works that the government 
has constructed there, and partly because of the climate. One of 
the greatest irrigation works undertaken is the Roosevelt dam 
in the Salt River, which will supply water for a large area near 
Phoenix. The climate near this city and Tucson is such that even 
semitropical fruits are produced. Here are raised oranges, lemons, 
grapefruit, figs, olives, pomegranates, and even dates. .. . 
So important is irrigation that it is introduced wherever possible, 
and every year new irrigation systems are being built, some at 
great expense. Since much of this arid region is public land, the 
United States government is aiding in this work. There 
in fact, a special department of the government in charge of it, 
and every year millions of dollars are being spent in this way. 
Enormous dams are built, forming lakes in the mountain valleys, 
and these are filled in the spring when the snow melts. Then, 
in summer, when the crops need water, it is let out of the reservoirs 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
INTENSIVE STUDY OF GEOGRAPHY 245 
into the irrigation canals. In this way the amount of farm land 
in the arid West is being greatly increased. This is one of the 
most important works in which our government is engaged. 
The account is illustrated with appropriate cuts. 
Advantages. — Type study is simply a very intensive 
study of a topic in many relations. Its purely geo- 
graphical, its scenic, biological, economic, historic, 
literary, and other aspects are all considered, not as so 
many separate studies, but all woven together to form a 
composite picture, that presents a fuller, richer, and 
better understood unity than the study of any one aspect 
could afford. 
It is assumed that the topic will be taught properly 
with concrete illustrations, elaboration and explana- 
tion. By such correlation, all-round study, illustra- 
tion, and use of supplementary reading, the subject is 
given freshness, vividness, and reality, and loses some- 
what its dry, unreal, textbook character. It affords 
a welcome relief from the monotony of superficiality by 
a chance for a bit of thoroughness. 
’ Another advantage of the type study method is that it 
permits the application of the sequential or causal order 
of study. Instead of the lesson being simply a list of 
facts to be memorized, it becomes a thoughtful study, a 
logical development with an organic unity. The many- 
sided correlation with science and history not only 
makes this causal study effective, but throws out many 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
246 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
suggestions that arouse the imagination, and force the 
mind to take a broader outlook on the subject. 
Modifications of the type. —In teaching by this method 
it must be remembered that the types chosen must be 
real types, selected with care, so that they may present as 
many as possible of the characteris of their cla 
The study, however, should include some comparison 
with others of the class to show that modifications are 
possible. Thus when the wheat industry of the Missis- 
sippi Valley is studied, reference might be made to the 
variation of harvesting as practiced in the fields of 
Washington and California; and to the harvesting, 
threshing, and milling as still carried on by primitive 
peoples. 
The chief objection to the type method is that it is too 
‘slow, and that only a few types can be studied thus 
intensively. It is, in ordinary schools, futile to teach 
only through types. There is always need of general 
geography to fill in the gaps left by the type method. In 
fact, the types require the more general, diffusive course 
as a background or setting. 
In the type study method there may, also, be some 
danger of overcorrelating and dragging in things that are 
not germane to the subject. Type study is too slow to 
permit much digression. Overcorrelation may render 
the subject so elaborate that the pupil may “ not see 
the forest for the trees.’’ If it be remembered that 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
INTENSIVE STUDY OF GEOGRAPHY 247 
correlation is not an end, but a means, of building a 
unified whole of the topic, this danger is averted. The 
subject should not be so elaborate that the pupil can- 
not analyze it. 
Types in the lower grades. — Type studies, or topical 
studies, of the simpler kind may be made in the lower 
grades. But, in general, this method requires a general 
knowledge of the world as a whole, of history, and of 
nature-study; the ability to read reference books and 
supplementary readers easily and intelligently; and 
the power to reason and discriminate, — conditions not 
found in the lower grades. 
While some of the more modern textbooks in geog- 
raphy aim largely to supplant the supplementary 
reader by the almost complete type treatment, there are 
still many briefer texts where this method must be 
supplied by the teacher, with the aid of wide reading on 
her own part, and the extensive use of supplementary 
readers by the pupils. In this case the type method 
affords the independent teacher an excellent opportunity 
of breaking away from “‘ the bondage of the text,” and, as 
it were, of making with her pupils her own textbook 
through reference work. 
The Topical Method. — Much that has been said 
about the type method applies to what is called the Topi- 
cal Method. Type study is topical study, but the types 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
248 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
are selected primarily with the idea that they are repre- 
sentatives and stand for a class. 
But that is not necessarily a consideration in the 
topical method. Any worthy feature of geography, 
several of the same class, even, may be used in the topical 
study. The main consideration here is to secure an 
interesting and intensive treatment, broader relations, 
more rational and less memoriter study. It was one of 
the first attempts to get the pupils and teachers more 
free from the order of the textbook. It is particularly 
good for reviews. The lessons are usually assigned and 
developed according to a topical analysis or outline. 
The textbook and supplementary references are used as 
the basis for the preparation of the lesson. 
The type study method as a principle. — The type 
method is one step in advance of the topical method, 
a more careful discrimination in the selection of topics 
so as to have them representative. It demands a 
reduction in the number of topics. The type method is 
more of a working principle in geography, in the light of 
which, or by means of which, further studies are inter- 
preted. 
Regional Geography. — Another method of thorough 
or intensive study, in the upper grades especially, is 
the method of Regional Geography. This means the 
intimate study of the interrelation of man and nature 
in some well-defined geographical unit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
INTENSIVE STUDY OF GEOGRAPHY 249 
The first regional study is home geography. — The 
home community and vicinity, both civic and natural, 
are studied here. The relation of man to nature is 
brought out, and the whole constitutes a well-rounded 
geographical unit. 
A geographical unit is a region that presents a general 
uniformity of topography, climate, vegetation, natural 
resources, occupations, or industries. If the human as- 
pects are left out of consideration, it is a physiographic 
unit or region; but if the life and works of man are 
emphasized, it is an economic or industrial unit. In the 
same way we may have racial or ethnographic units 
and political units (states). \ 
In regional geography the political boundaries are nec- 
essarily often crossed, and parts of different political units 
included, which in this method is of minor consequence. 
Thus the commercial and industrial center or unit of 
New York City includes the Jersey towns across the 
Bay — Jersey City, Bayonne, Hoboken, Newark, etc., 
and the towns of Yonkers, New Rochelle, etc. in New 
York State. All these towns have the same community 
interest as Greater New York. Their growth and 
business depend directly on New York City, and to a 
very large extent their inhabitants work in the Greater 
City by day and only sleep in these suburbs by night. 
It is therefore fitting to study this large population center 
together as one. 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Again Pittsburg stands for an industrial center of a 
different type. This city is surrounded by a cluster of 
towns, all, like Pittsburg, handling coal and iron, smelting 
ore, rolling steel, and casting machinery. Their location 
was largely determined by nature, as was certainly 
their business growth. To work out this relation to 
the topography and mineral resources of the immediate 
and to the farther ore fields of the Superior 
region, and to the various markets, makes an interesting, 
instructive study. 
An international industrial unit. — Similarly the Euro- 
pean Pittsburg, the region of Lille, Nancy, Liege, and 
Essen, where the three countries of France, Belgium, and 
Germany fit together, is another industrial unit which 
disregards: political boundaries. 
The Alps lie in five different countries, but to get the 
best idea of this interesting system of mountains, — 
their formation, character, scenery, and influence on 
the industries of man, — they should be studied as a 
unit, not cut up and studied in parts in the different 
countries to which they belong. The Alps are a physio- 
graphic unit. 
Our own Appalachian System may be studied in a 
similar fashion. The Mississippi Valley, the Great 
Basin, the Great Western Plains, the Prairies, the Russian 
Steppes, the Desert of Sahara, and the Tropical Forests 
of Brazil are other physiographic regions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
INTENSIVE STUDY OF GEOGRAPHY 251 
The advantages in regional study are, first, that of 
handling a whole unit and treating it with satisfying com- 
prehensiveness; second, that of being able to apply the 
causal method in working out the twofold aspect of 
Earth and Man; third, that it is time-saving and concen- 
trating, as there are fewer great geographical units than 
politi fourth, that it is an excellent method for 
review and organization; fifth, that many of these geo- 
graphical units are at the same time types. 
Adapted for upper grades. — With the exception of 
home geography, regional geography is not adapted to 
the lower grades. It requires a fair knowledge of the 
world as a whole and of the map of the nations. For 
upper grades the regional treatment would be very good 
for a review. It would present a new and pleasing point 
of view, and a new method of approach. Many new 
and significant relations would be discovered which 
escaped notice in the usual systematic study of country 
by country, according to the political map. The study of 
the Great Plains, page 75, is a regional study. 
Comparative Geography. — The term was introduced 
by Ritter, but was applied by him more to a categoric 
comparison of similar features in different lands, as the 
rivers of Europe with those of Asia, their mountains, 
etc., for the purpose of deriving general principles. 
Intensive comparison. — A later meaning of the ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
pression sometimes called Intensive Comparison is 
closely related to the Causal Method. It requires a 
reflective comparison of different parts of the world to 
form certain generalizations and principles. Thus, Of 
what importance is the ocean? What is the relation 
of rivers to man? What is the climatic effect of eleva- 
tion? are questions requiring mature, comparative con- 
sideration. 
Review by comparison.— But there is another sense 
in which the expression, the Comparative Method, or 
Comparative Geography, is used. It means the frequent 
reference to previously studied types or lessons, such as 
home geography, physiographic and industrial types, 
even type continents, during the study of new lessons. 
It is virtually making use of the apperceptive basis 
wherever a new study is made. The purpose of such 
comparison is first to give a better understanding of the 
new topic; to bring out interesting similarities or differ- 
ences that help, through association, to fix the fact; 
to weave together or organize widely separated lessons, 
and ultimately the whole subject, into a whole ; and inci- 
dentally, though of no slight importance, to review the 
old facts to refresh the memory. Therefore it is some- 
times called the method of Review by Comparison. 
Illustration.— The study of Europe presupposes a 
study of the North American Continent. The general 
features of topography, climate, industry, etc., should be 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
INTENSIVE STUDY OF GEOGRAPHY 253 
recalled to aid in the understanding of the new conti- 
nent: Compare the two continents as to area; as to 
irregularity of coasts. What is the chief coastal industry 
of New England? Why? Would the same be true 
of Europe? Why? In what latitude are the British 
Isles? Compare with that of Labrador. What do the 
isotherms of England indicate? Let us look for the 
cause of this climate. In what wind belt is Labrador? 
Do the winds blow from the sea there? What kind of 
winds blow over England? When sea breezes blow on 
the land on the Pacific Coast how do they affect the tem- 
perature? Are these winds moist or dry? How is the 
moisture of these winds condensed in western United 
States? Now, what should be the effect of the Atlan- 
tic winds on England? Etc. In this way the study 
requires thought, and becomes much more interesting 
and effective than the ordinary memoriter process of 
learning the text. 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
CHAPTER XX 
PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHY 
Correlation in geography. — Repeated reference has 
been made in the foregoing pages to the unpedagogical 
and wasteful method of learning geographical facts in 
isolation or without reference to their relations to each 
other. Various ways have been suggested to bring 
about the desirable association of fact and fact. Among 
them are the causal relation series, group classification, 
types, and the comparative method. These are all 
systematic organizing processes to reduce the hetero- 
geneous mass of geographical matter to order and unity, 
not merely for the sake of the science, but rather for the 
sake of the learner, as a help to the understanding and to 
assist the memory. 
Generalizations of geography.— There is still another 
way of organizing the facts of geography, and that is by 
reducing them to definitions and abstract principles. In 
arithmetic there are a thousand and one problems, yet 
these fall under relatively few rules for solving, and under 
few captions. It is so in geography. The definitions 
and principles may, also, as in arithmetic, be used in

PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHY 255 
These definitions and principles were, in the geography 
of our grandfathers, usually stated dogmatically at the 
beginning of the book, and applied deductively to the 
rest. The fault of this plan was that the pupils had 
no_real concent of these fundamentals, and therefore 
the deductions were vague, unreal, or entirely impossible. 
This naturally brought a revolt, and there came into 
vogue a series of texts that developed these abstractions 
from the pupil’s own experience in home geography. 
These were called the Inductive Geographies, or Natural 
Method of Geography. 
The geographies of to-day, in general, follow this plan. 
The facts of physical geography, including climate and 
human occupations, are treated inductively, and then 
applied to the following descriptive geography. 
Concepts vs. words. — Care must be exercised that 
these definitions and laws of geography have a meaning 
to the pupil, or they may be simply parroted after rote 
study. (By drawing these concepts from the pupil’s own 
environment and experience, requiring him to express 
his generalizations in his own language, by assisting him 
with field studies, experiments, pictures, and other con- 
crete demonstration, by rendering them interesting and 
clearer by oral description and supplementary reading, 
these basic definitions and principles may be given a 
real meaning. ) If the pupil can in his mind’s eye see a 
mountain, a river, a spring, a quarry, a grain field, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
256 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
lumber woods, the prairie, the factory, the bustle of a 
big city, — he has the concept, whether he can give the 
definition or not. And if we could be sure that he had 
this concept, it would not matter very much about the 
formal definition. In a similar manner larger concepts 
of physiographical regions, climatic relations, or even 
whole continents may be developed. Good concepts 
of definitions serve to tie together a multitude of geo- 
graphical facts into bundles of sorted knowledge. 
Principles of geography are the natural laws according 
_to which physical and human agencies in geography 
act. )Rivers illustrate a great, though simple, principle ; 
namely, that water flows downhill. From numberless 
outdoor observations, perhaps repeated in classroom 
experiments, the pupil generalizes that water flows down 
a slope. Simple as it is, this is an important principle 
in geography. From several experiments and other 
observations he learns the principle that cold air dis- 
places warm air and that this is the primary cause of 
winds. He learns from observation and reading that 
mines are chiefly located in mountain regions, because 
of the fracture, faulting, and erosion of the strata, thus 
exposing the mineral resources. In the same way he 
learns the principle that we export our surplus, and 
import what we need when we do not produce enough. 
From concrete cases, then, the abstract law or principle 
is generalized. Unfortunately teachers often, and many 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHY 257 
texts, do not push the pupils beyond the premise on 
to the conclusion. That is, all the necessary facts for 
the generalization are presented, but the matter is not 
clinched by the derivation of the principle embodied. 
Even in the primary grades, and increasingly more so 
in the upper grades, numerous simpler principles may 
be developed. This practice would stimulate the pupils 
to think, and would do much to raise the subject in 
intellectual merit. 
Of course, these abstract concepts cannot be grasped 
all at once by the pupils. It may be necessary to wait 
till the second, third, or even later occurrence of the 
principle; but a time will come when the principle has 
been sufficiently illustrated to be inferred. In this way, 
often, past lessons are reviewed and associated. These 
definitions and principles, like the facts of the map, cli- 
mate, industry, and the like, are a part of the subject 
matter of geography, and should not be neglected. Like 
the facts referred to, they require drill and review to 
fix them. 
But these generalizations are not an end in themselves, 
interesting as they may be; they rather serve as working 
rules, or a means for the interpretation of further studies 
and the harmonizing of previous lessons. 
The principles of geography are the philosophy of 
the science. — They are often to be found only between 
the lines. The teacher, certainly, should know some- 
s 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
258 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
thing of this philosophy, and should teach according to 
and toward it; so that ultimately the pupils will see 
something of it. The principles that thus underlie 
geography knit the whole subject together, and serve to 
organize it into a science. 
Below are the chief concepts and principles of geog- 
raphy, aside from simple definitions of the ordinary 
geographical features, that pupils of the eighth grade 
should possess as a result of their course. 
Important Facts and Principles of Geography 
MATHEMATICAL 
The Sun holds the earth in its orbit, gives light and 
heat, and makes life possible on the earth. Affects 
the tides. 
Rotation causes day and night, rising and setting of 
sun, moon, and stars, causes difference of time between 
places of different longitudes — 15 degrees of longitude 
makes a difference of one hour. 
Revolution (with inclination and parallelism of axis) 
determines seasons, the year, zones of light. 
Latitude and Longitude are used to locate places. Lati- 
tude and longitude are used in surveys (boundaries, etc.). 
Longitude is based upon the prime meridian (Greenwich).

he reads them,

PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHY 259 
PuysicaL GEOGRAPHY 
Topography. — 1. Coasts. — Depressed part of surface 
is sea bottom; the elevated, continents. These rela- 
tions are unstable, coasts rising or being submerged 
(drowned), affecting the form of seacoast. Rising 
coasts are straight or smooth in outline; sinking coasts 
are irregular. The former afford poor harborage; the 
latter, good harbors, and stimulate sea commerce and 
fisheries. 
2. Plains. —Two types, coastal and interior. The 
strata of plains are usually not much folded or uplifted. 
Plains have the largest rivers. Plains are not deeply 
eroded by rivers, hence good communication, stimu- 
lating settlement and commerce, also encouraging in- 
vasion. Agriculture and herding, and, where forests, 
lumbering, are the chief industries. Plains have the 
densest population. Many and large cities are found 
here. Manufacturing and commerce thrive. 
3. Plateaus. — Are broad, uplifted (high), yet not 
greatly folded strata. They determine the drainage of 
the continents. Are much dissected by rivers, hence 
communication. is bad. Temperature is lowered by 
plateaus.. Plateau industries — farming, grazing, lum- 
bering, manufacturing (water power). Population is 
sparse, owing to difficulty of travel and commerce. 
Plateau peoples are apt to become isolated, and back- 
ward in civilization. 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
260 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
4. Mountains.— Are folded, often broken, highly 
lifted strata, generally much eroded (therefore contents 
exposed, and hence quarries and mines). Temperature 
decreases gradually from base to summit. Mountains 
running north and south affect especially the distribu- 
tion of rainfall. Cause condensation and rainfall-on 
their windward side; cut off rain from their lee. Their 
perennial snow, glaciers, and rain supply the many 
rivers that rise here. Mountain regions have sparse 
population. Mountains are difficult to travel over. 
They act as barriers to animal and plant life, to migra- 
tion of nations, to trade and customs, are often political 
boundaries. Mountain industries — herding, lumber- 
ing, manufacturing (water power), mining, quarrying. 
Mountains are used for recreation largely on account 
of their scenic aspect. 
Ocean (Seas, Lakes). — In depressions on the earth. 
Divide the lands. Compel navigation. Stimulate 
marine commerce. Water, the cheapest means of trans- 
portation. Modify extremes of temperature. Source of 
rain (evaporation). Tides caused by attraction of moon 
and sun. Ocean currents (chiefly drift by prevailing 
winds) equalize temperature of the ocean water ; slightly 
affect navigation. Waves both erode and make coasts 
and islands. Impede navigation. The conquest of 
the ocean is codrdinate with history and civilization. 
Many great ports and commercial centers on coasts. 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHY 261 
Fisheries (including sealing, whaling, etc.) an ocean in- 
dustry. 
Weathering. — Solvent water and chemically acting 
elements in the air, expanding ice in pores of rock, acids 
of plants and animals, and gravity are the agents. 
Result — sculpturing of land forms (scenery), decayed 
rock, soil. The kind and character of the soil depend 
upon the kind of rock from which it was formed (sand- 
stone forms sand; granite forms sand, clay, etc.). 
Soil is the basis for agriculture, the greatest human 
industry, the basis for human life. Other industries — 
glass making (sand), brick making (clay) — depend on 
products of weathering. 
Streams. — Rain, the source of streams. Their 
course determined by the slope of the land. Running 
water erodes. Streams carry sediment. This is de- 
posited in part (largest particles first) or all when the 
velocity of the water is partially or completely checked. 
Result — bars, deltas, flood plain. Streams undercut 
on the outer curve (swiftest current) and deposit on 
the inner curve of a bend (slow current), resulting in 
meandering. Deltas form in quiet lakes, bays, or seas; 
estuaries where the sediment is removed by the waves 
and currents (tidal). 
Navigable rivers occur more in plains than in plateaus 
(slower). Such rivers stimulate exploration, settle- 
ment, commerce. Water power and manufacturing are 
    
   
-P-A-G-E-274
262 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
found at falls, rapids, and on swift streams, chiefly 
in highlands. Here manufacturing cities may devel 
By modern transmission of water power by electricity 
such power may be utilized hundreds of miles from its 
source, in places more accessible and convenient for 
commerce. Great river plains are the seat of greatest 
populations and highest civilizations. Here agriculture 
and related commerce flourish. Rivers are used for 
commercial navigation, and their valleys for wagon 
roads and railroads, and canals (easy grades). Rivers 
are difficult to cross, requiring ferries, bridges, tunnels. 
Rivers are often natural boundaries. 
Glaciers. — Result from the perennial accumulation 
of snow on mountains. This snow changes to ice by 
pressure, thawing, and freezing. The mass of ice moves 
down the slopes like a plastic body, “ flows,” but does 
not slide. A glacier advances lower to a point where it 
melts as fast as it advances. Here is the “foot.” The 
melting glaciers feecl streams and rivers. Glaciers 
erode and grind the strata over which they move, 
making glacial débris or glacial soil. This they carry 
to the foot and deposit there as a moraine. Glacial 
soils are generally deep and fertile, but sometimes too 
thin, sandy, or rocky for agriculture (New England). 
Glaciers dam up rivers, causing lakes and waterfalls. 
Glacial scenery — falls, lakes, hilly topography. Eco- 
nomic consequences—-generally beneficial to agriculture 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHY 263 
and water power (manufacturing), but the hills interfere 
with travel. 
Climate.—1. Heat belts—The spherical earth re- 
ceives the parallel rays of the sun at varying angles, 
most vertically near the equator, more slantingly near 
the poles. The heating effect of the rays decreases as 
they fall more slantingly. Therefore cold at the poles, 
hot at the equator. The earth is traversed east and 
west by isotherms. Certain isotherms, e.g. 70 and 30 
degrees, mark off irregular bands called heat belts) usually 
five, though by subdivision more. (Land absorbs and 
radiates heat more quickly than does water) On ac- 
count of this the isotherms and heat belts are deflected 
over the land toward the equator in the winter, toward 
the polesinsummer. All isotherms and heat belts migrate 
north and south with the apparent shifting of the sun, 
according to the season. Animal and plant life is 
distributed in east and west zones, adapted to the tem- 
perature. Man must adapt his life to the heat belts— 
clothing, habits, industry (agriculture). (The highest 
civilizations are found in the temperate regionswhere the 
spur of climate is not so great as in the frigid, and where 
the climate is not so enervating, nor so generous with 
subsistence as in the tropics. 
2. Winds.—Cause—convection and unequal baro- 
metric pressure. The convection is usually due to un- 
equal heating of the sun’s rays (varying angle) as in case 
    
  
 
-P-A-G-E-276
264 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
of trades and antitrades; or to unequal absorption 
and radiation of heat by land and water in different 
seasons (monsoons), or night and day (land and sea 
breezes, local). Air moves from the colder to the warmer 
region. (Cold air is heavier, and displaces, pushes up, 
the warm air.) Trade winds blow toward the equator 
at the surface of earth, and are deflected toward the west 
by the earth’s rotation. These currents rise at the 
heat equator (belt of calms). Cooling in the higher alti- 
tude, they turn north and south, gradually descending as 
the antitrades. The antitrades are turned toward the 
east by rotation of the earth. The antitrades settle to 
the ground in about 30 degrees north and south latitude, 
here forming another calm belt (horse latitudes), and, 
because warming up are drying currents, form deserts. 
The westerlies may be considered as the antitrades 
continuing in the same general direction but on the 
surface of the earth. Most of the great nations 
of the world lie in this belt. Unequal atmospheric 
pressures tend to equalize, the air flowing from a region 
of higher to one of lower pressure. Air blowing from a 
“high” toward a “low” from north and south is de- 
flected by the earth’s rotation, just as the trades and 
antitrades, tending to set up an eddying motion — 
cyclone. 
3. Rain.—Source—the sea, by evaporation. Air ab- 
sorbs vapor to the saturation point. The saturation 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  
PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHY 265 
point increases with the temperature. The warmer the 
air, the more water vapor it can hold. Air at the satura- 
tion point, when chilled, has some of its vapor con- 
densed in proportion to the amount of chilling. The vapor 
in air is condensed as the air rises to colder altitudes by 
convection, or is forced up cold mountain sides. Clouds 
are the result of the condensation of vapor. They consist 
of minute drops of water (mist). The wind carries the 
clouds. The distribution and amount of rain varies with 
the prevailing winds, altitude, latitude, distance from 
sea. Rainfall is abundant in the belt of calms, owing to 
great evaporation, and the ascent of the vapor till 
condensed by the cold. Rainfall is greatest on the wind- 
ward side of mountains. Mountains running north and 
south seriously affect the distribution of the rainfall. 
It is greatest on the eastern side of mountains in the 
trade wind belt; on the western side, in the westerlies. 
Rainfall conditions change at the borders of wind belts, 
since a place (e.g. southern California) may first be in 
the trade wind belt (summer), then in the westerlies 
(winter), as the heat belts shift with the seasons; thus 
wet and dry seasons result. When winds descend they 
warm up, their moisture capacity or saturation point is 
raised, and they become drying winds; hence in such 
regions are deserts or semideserts. The same is true of 
the trades as they blow from colder to warmer regions, 
and where they have been blowing over the land instead 
   
-P-A-G-E-278
266 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
of the sea deserts may result (Arabia, Sahara). The rain- 
fall conditions in the western half of the United States 
are determined by the westerlies and the trend, loca- 
tion, and height of the western mountains. The eastern 
half of the United States gets its rain from the Gulf 
and the Atlantic through the agency of the cyclones. 
The south and east winds of acyclone bring vapor. This 
is condensed because the winds go from the south to the 
north, because they meet the cold winds from the north, 
and because they rise to cooler heights at the low 
pressure center, and rain follows. This precipitation 
takes place chiefly in the eastern half of the cyclone. 
Cyclones drift with the westerlies toward the east. 
Hence storms migrate eastward. Places over which a 
cyclone passes experience a regular sequence of weather 
changes. These facts are the basis for weather predic- 
tions. Rain is an important factor in determining the 
amount and kinds of vegetation. Forests require the 
most rainfall, over twenty inches; grasses next, then 
desert plants. Agriculture must be adapted to rainfall 
conditions. Cereals, especially wheat, do not thrive 
in too moist a climate (over fifty inches), but may be 
grown with fifteeninches. Agriculture is possible in semi- 
arid and desert regions by means of irrigation. Unequal 
distribution of rain determines the north and south belts 
of vegetation types, especially marked in North and 
South America. Jungles, forests, llanos, pampas, prairies, 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHY 267 
steppes, deserts, are types of vegetation resulting from 
varying rainfall. Forests do not cause rain, but 
conserve and, retard the run-off. Therefore forest 
reserves. Rainfall supplies streams, springs, wells. 
Rainfall affects navigation, water power. 
COMMERCIAL GEOGRAPHY 
Commerce. — Man’s industry depends upon his needs. 
These depend upon climate, topography, natural re- 
sources. His needs increase with his civilization. 
Savages have few needs beyond bare necessaries for 
existence, and these are supplied generally by nature 
direct, or without much effort. Civilized man needs 
food, clothing, shelter; but also conveniences and 
luxuries beyond what is needed for bare existence. 
Civilized man is provident, specializes in industry, has 
division of labor, — this resulting in exchange, trade. 
Diversity of climate, topography, natural resources, and 
racial characteristics stimulate trade. The law of sup- 
‘ply and demand governs exchange. Countries sell their 
surplus as exports, and buy imports which they cannot 
produce at all or not as cheaply as other regions. Nature 
furnishes raw materials for man to convert into finished 
goods or products. Commerce is the exchange of raw 
and finished materials, and is carried on by the industry 
of transportation. Industry and commerce both require 
labor and capital, and are stimulated by peace and 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
268 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
stable government. Great commercial nations main- 
tain great navies on the theory that they guarantee 
peace and are a protection to commerce. Colonial 
possessions foster trade with the mother country. 
Trend of commerce is affected by government regula- 
tions, tariffs, etc. 
Animal industries.— 1. Hunting and fishing, the 
earliest human industries. They require the wil- 
derness for hunting grounds. Supply a precarious ex- 
istence. 
2. Fur Trade.— This is closely connected with the 
last. Flourishes in cold temperate, and sub-polar coun- 
tries. With advance of settlement game and fur animals 
vanish. 
3. Herding. — Requires extensive lands for pasturage. 
Hence practiced in open plains, prairies, steppes, but also 
on nonagricultural lands on mountain slopes. The 
herding of cattle, horses, sheep, etc., began far back in 
the history of civilization, the pastoral period, and was 
a great step in advance. Represents a provident method 
of food and clothing supply. Generally herding peoples 
are nomadic. Connected with herding is the meat 
industry (ranching, killing, packing, shipping, selling — 
done with much division of labor in widely different re- 
gions). The wool and leather industries also are con- 
nected with the last. In general, poultry, swine, cattle, 
sheep, horses, are raised in small numbers everywhere 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHY 269 
on small farms, but herding of great herds is done on the 
frontier, — the foothills, the semiarid plains, etc. 
Agriculture. — More people are occupied in this 
than in any other industry. Culturally, agriculture cor- 
responds to the stage of the domestication of animals. 
It shows forethought, provision for the future. Wild 
stocks of plants are improved by cultivation, and by 
selective breeding. Agriculture is strictly limited by 
topography, soil conditions, and climate. By irrigation, 
unfavorable rainfall conditions are modified, making 
agriculture possible. Crops must be adapted to natural 
conditions. Crops are chiefly distributed in east and 
west belts according to temperature; in north and south 
belts (North and South America) according to rainfall. 
The chemical nature (fertility) of the soil affects vegeta- 
tion. Quartz sand (New England) has too little; alkali 
land (West)iltoo much soluble matter. Rocky or very 
hilly land is unsuitable for farming. The great level 
plains of the world are the chief seat of agriculture. 
Forests must first be felled to permit farming. The 
treeless prairies are especially suited for agriculture. 
Agriculture is vastly facilitated by the use of improved 
machinery (invention). Modern science has greatly 
improved the methods of farming, and the productivity 
of the crops. By importation (United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture) new plants, adapted to various 
soil and climatic conditions, are introduced, and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
270 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
possibilities of farming increased. In newer lands farm- 
ing is generally on a large scale, with few crops. In 
older settled regions there are smaller farms and more 
diversified farming. Near cities there is truck farming. 
In new countries agriculture is usually the first industry, 
later manufacturing develops, and may even displace the 
former (New England). 
Lumbering. — At first always based upon natural 
forests; later upon planted forests (forestry). Forests 
grow where there is twenty inches of rain a year and it is 
not too cold. The tree-line on cold mountains and in 
polar countries marks temperature limit of trees. Coni- 
fers thrive in colder regions; hardwoods, in warmer. 
Lumbering is usually carried on at the frontier and on 
mountains. Methods vary with climate and topography. 
In the north lumbering is usually conducted in winter. 
Logs are floated down streams with g@ring floods. 
Destruction of forests reduces lumber supply, also per- 
mits too great erosion and floods. Forest reserves are 
for purpose of checking these evils. Forests regulate 
the supply of water in streams. Architecture and 
making of furniture are affected by forests. 
Mineral industry. — Depends upon mineral content 
of the earth. Methods vary with the mineral and its 
mode of occurrence. Many mines are in mountains 
because the folded strata are eroded and the contents 
exposed. But mining can be conducted on plains 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHY 271 
(coal fields of Ohio, etc.). Mining is often the only ob- 
ject of settlement of a country; may be transient. 
More permanent ore deposits develop manufacturing 
towns. Coal and iron the most important mineral 
resources. No nation can aspire to commercial su- 
premacy without these. Close connection exists be- 
tween the coal and iron industries — smelting requires 
coal; coal is necessary to run machinery. Where coal 
and iron are found together great manufacturing centers 
arise. Stone and clay are important as building mate- 
rials. Architecture is affected by the materials of con- 
struction, —iron, stone, brick, etc. 
Manufacturing. — Depends upon the stage of civiliza- 
tion, the needs, inventiveness, and industry of the 
people, and upon the nature and abundance of the raw 
materials, and the availability of power (wind, water, 
coal, electricity). ay be conducted in nonagricultural 
lands, as mountains and seashore, but also thrives in 
agricultural regions of later development. Must have 
means of transportation, — sea, rivers, railroads. Must 
have markets, domestic and foreign. Agricultural raw 
materials: grain, corn, cotton, sugar, meat, wool, hides, 
etc. Raw materials from forests: lumber, bark, pulp, 
sap. Raw materials from mines: stone, clay, cement, 
phosphate, coal, metals, minerals. The cost of finished 
product depends upon price of raw material, labor, 
capital invested, taxes, duties, power, transportat 
and middlemen. 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
    
272 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Transportation.— Kinds : man, beast of burden, wagon, 
rail, boat; these in the order of expense, the cheapest 
last. Routes: overland, tunnels, rivers, sea, canal. 
Perishable goods shipped by fastest means and shortest 
routes. Heavy commodities by water, or slow freight. 
Topography and water ways determine routes. Com- 
merce seeks the shortest and cheapest routes. Valley 
grades of rivers, mountain passes and valleys, level 
plains, are easiest for overland commerce. 
Location of cities. — Generally in the beginning some 
physical feature or physical condition determined the 
choice, though it was often affected by historic or eco- 
nomic conditions, or even mere whim and chance. 
Favorable locations: on good harbors, in center of 
region rich in resources, near productive country that is 
accessible by good routes of commerce, at railroad centers, 
at the mouths or confluences of rivers, at the natural 
breaks in navigation (falls, rapids, shoal water), at water 
power (falls and rapids), at coal fields (power), favorable 
climatic region.

CHAPTER XXI 
CORRELATION 
The principle of correlation applied in geography. — 
There was a period, the first part of the nineteenth 
century, when geography first reached its standing as a 
distinct science, when it was limited strictly to geograph- 
ical facts in the narrower sense, and consisted chiefly 
of definitions, locations of places, mathematical geog- 
raphy, and a few facts about the topography, climate, 
and industries of the various countries. 
The product was a categorical statement of the geo- 
graphic features from the static standpoint. There was 
very little, if any, reference to their significance, their 
causes, or consequences, or their other relationships ; 
or of the bearing of geography on other subjects; or of 
these on geography. Naturally such geographies were 
uninteresting. 
They were merely lists of geographical facts, arranged 
in amore or less systematic and logical order. The easi- 
est way to learn such books was by committing them 
to memory, which was then avowedly the most “ peda- 
gogical’”” method, and various devices were used to 
aid the memory in accomplishing the task. 
7 273 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
274 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Unfortunately this method is not quite extinct. It 
is a very common practice in the classroom, and some 
textbooks do not suggest or permit a better way. 
But the Herbart-Ziller principle of correlation, that 
neither facts, lessons, nor whole subjects should be 
treated as separate entities, but should rather be studied 
in connection with other facts, lessons, or subjects, and 
woven into a larger, richer fabric, a larger truth — 
has been applied also to geography. 
By correlation is not meant an arbitrary, forced, un- 
natural association of facts or subjects, but bringing 
together that which is naturally, logically, and even 
necessarily related, for the purpose of presenting the 
facts thus correlated in a new aspect, to approach the 
subject from a new point of view; to explain a fact by 
means of that which is correlated; or to get a new light 
or a new truth by reflecting on the correlation pre- 
sented. 
If the study of geography is to be truly rational, not 
memoriter merely, previous, related lessons or facts 
should be used as stepping-stones in the study of any 
new lesson. It is unpedagogical not to consider, to 
correlate, this fundamental knowledge. 
Examples. — The study of the climate of a land, for 
instance, should be worked out by applying principles 
of topography, wind, and temperature learned in previous 
lessons. The shifting of the heat belts is explained by 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
CORRELATION 275 
the lesson on the seasons. The industrial (mining) 
section around Lake Superior should be brought into 
relation with the previous study of the Great Lakes 
Waterway, and the Pittsburg (coal and iron) region. 
This last example of correlation would teach such 
commercial principles as the dependence of section on 
section, the great advantage of natural routes of traffic, 
the cheapness of water transportation, and other general 
truths. The commercial supremacy of New York City 
in the New World must be based on its harbor, central 
location, rich interior, the construction of the Erie 
Canal along a route prepared by nature, and the mod- 
ern railroad facilities. This case of correlation shows 
the additional facts of historic development, the value 
of the work of previous generations, and the controlling 
influence of nature. 
Correlations of geography.— An almost constant 
correlation of the experiences and knowledge of home 
geography should be practiced throughout the course as 
a measure of the foreign geography, or a means for 
understanding it. This is using home geography as a 
principle of study. 
In a similar way geography should be correlated with 
natural science, mathematics, history, and literature. 
These are brought in only “ to lend a hand ”’ in explain- 
ing purely geographical facts; to make them more 
interesting by showing that they have a wider applica- 
> rd 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
276 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
tion than just in geography; or to bring out general 
ideas not possible by the solitary study of geography. 
Geography is the study of the Earth and Man as 
telated to each other. There are two view-points in 
this subject, the one looking toward the phenomena 
of nature, the other at the lives of men. The Earth is 
the inanimate sphere with its modifying natural forces, 
its vegetation and animal life. The Man element deals 
with man not only as a creature with animal needs, 
but with intelligence in adapting himself to natural 
conditions, even to the extent of modifying some of 
them; with his economic, social, governmental, and 
even spiritual problems. In this sense, geography is 
an all-inclusive, complex science, dealing, in a measure, 
and in its specific way, with the facts of astronomy, 
geology, meteorology, botany, zodlogy, ethnology, an- 
thropology, economics, sociology, history, civics, and 
even art, literature, and religion. 
Geography a unity. — Geography is far from being 
a jumble or patchwork of all these subjects. ‘‘ Geog- 
raphy is not the dumping ground for all subjects or 
sciences for which there is no other place.”’ (Kiepert.) 
“ Geography should be a closed unity.” (F. Lampe.) 
“ Geography is a unity, with a well-defined essence of 
its own. Complexity is no reproach. The same is 
true of history, language, economics, and _ biology.” 
(William Davis.) Botany deals with the geographic

distribution of plants, yet does not presume to teach 
geography as such. Likewise when geography includes 
historical references or sketches, laws of physics, or 
descriptions of plants of different climates, it is not 
attempting to teach history, physics, or botany. The 
object is to give, perhaps, an historical perspective, to 
trace the historical development of a geographical 
topic; to use the facts of geography to explain the con- 
ditions of an historic fact. By such correlation geog- 
raphy is enlivened and enriched. But geography is not 
the only subject benefited, for the benefits from correla- 
tion are mutual. 
The first correlation of geography is with nature-study. 
—In fact, in the beginning, in the primary grades, 
geography is not separated from nature-study, but is 
taught under that name. Such topics as weathering, 
soil, rocks, minerals, brook, erosion, forms of water, 
rain, snow, clouds, wind, sky, sun, hills, valley, and 
other familiar topics appear in nature courses, yet are 
strictly geographical in their nature. The principles 
of plant and animal life, and the facts about specific 
plants and animals, e.g. cultivated plants, trees, and 
domesticated animals, are likewise available in geog- 
raphy. 
It is not, usually, till the fourth year of school that 
nature-study and geography come to the parting of 
the ways. Even then they should not entirely lose 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
278 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
sight of each other, but whenever it is to their mutual 
advantage should bridge the gap by correlation. In 
many well-organized school courses these two subjects 
are so planned as to permit this correlation. In fact, 
nature-study should be the handmaid of geography 
throughout the elementary school course, as natural 
sclence is the auxiliary of the science of geography 
in higher institutions. 
The lesson on corn, wheat, or the cotton plant in 
nature-study cannot but help the geographical study of 
the industry based on the plant. The pupil who has 
followed the cycle of the trees and herbs through the 
seasons is better able to understand the references in 
geography to the climatic effects on vegetation. If he 
has cultivated a garden, or raised a potted plant in 
nature-study, he is better able to appreciate in geog- 
raphy the great industry of agriculture. 
Nature-study can do much to supplement geography, 
or to take from geography the more biological features 
less germane to the latter subject. Some geographers do 
not believe in including the biological description of the 
animals and plants of geography, nor even the industrial 
processes of production and manufacture. It is all the 
more necessary, therefore, to have nature-study codperat- 
ing with geog:..phy, so that in the latter subject it may 
be assumed that the natural science phase of things 
geographical has been taught, or that the barest ref- 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
CORRELATION 
erence to this suffices. This assumption is by no 
means well founded, so many authors of geography 
boldly include considerable nature-study, necessary for 
the proper development of the subject. 
Physics and geography. — This is, for example, well 
shown by the correlation of physics. It is perfectly 
legitimate to begin the beautiful causal series of climate 
study with simple experiments in evaporation, condensa- 
tion, convection of air, and the principle of the barometer. 
For it is an utter impossibility to give a real conception 
of rain, clouds, and winds without these explanatory 
principles from physics. But it would not be proper, 
in the geography lesson, to discuss the application of 
physical laws to other than purely geographical matters. 
It would have been better, of course, if the necessary 
physics lessons had been taught in nature-study or 
elementary science beforehand, and then simply applied 
in geography. 
Arithmetic, also, is correlated with geography in 
drawing to scale, comparison of areas, estimating dis- 
tances, statistics, latitude and longitude, difference of 
time, and circular measure. Not enough consideration 
is given to the proper correlation of these two subjects, 
since we try to teach children the use of the scale before 
they have had the necessary fractions, and refer to de- 
grees of latitude and longitude, and to linear measure- 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  
  280 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
ments before they have had denominate numbers. This 
leads to confusion and parroting. But when pupils have 
the basic arithmetical knowledge, they should be re- 
quired to apply it in appropriate places in geography. 
History and geography are inseparable, just as 
geography and science are inseparable. History, per- 
haps, has more need of geography than this subject has 
of history. Without a geographical arena, it would 
be vague, unreal, unsatisfying, and abstract. History 
is mundane, happening in definite localities, and is to a 
large extent actually determined by the geographical 
factors of these regions. The battle of Thermopyle, 
Hannibal’s invasion of Italy, Columbus’ discovery, the 
history of the ‘‘ Tight Little Isle,” the history of aboli- 
tion in New England and of slave-holding in the South, 
the settlement of the Mississippi Valley, would all have 
been different, or would, perhaps, not have occurred at 
all if the geographical stage of these events had been 
different. A knowledge of the topographic, climatic, 
racial, industrial, and other geographic conditions of 
history enable one to appreciate it all the more. 
On the other hand, in the study of geography, the 
allusion to famous incidents or historic progress in the 
regions studied make them more real and interesting, 
and serve to emphasize the human element, without 
which geography would be only geology or physical 
   
-P-A-G-E-293
  CORRELATION 281 
geography. Geographical features should be studied in 
the light of history in order to give perspective, to trace 
origin, or development, in which step by step the com- 
bined effects of man and nature may be seen shaping 
their progress. The very names on the map are foolish 
or meaningless unless we know their origin. Many of 
them enshrine the memory of great events; Babylon, 
Jerusalem, Rome, Constantinople, Orleans, Waterloo, 
Sedan, Plymouth, are names that wrap in themselves 
much history, and to pass over them in geography with- 
out a reference to this history is like Hamlet with Ham- 
let left out. 
American geography must be studied in the light of 
European history, especially English, if we wish to un- 
derstand it fully. The events of early settlement, the 
nature of the colonists, the various nationalities develop- 
ing the continent, the languages, civic institutions, and 
spiritual ideals can only be appreciated fully by consider- 
ing the historic factors determining them. One of the 
aims of geography is to develop patriotism. This cannot 
be done by simply bragging about the vastness of our 
country, its limitless natural resources, and the majesty 
and beauty of its scenery, but requires some knowledge 
of the trend of history, the way in which the weal and 
the woe of the inhabitants have been affected by their 
physical environment, and how they labored to adjust 
themselves to this environment, or heroically made 
   
-P-A-G-E-294
    
282 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
for themselves a new one by strength of arm and 
intellect. 
In Europe, particularly in Germany, history and geog- 
raphy are taught in much more intimate union than in 
this country. In fact, there geography is commonly 
taught by the history teacher. In America, if the 
departmental system prevails, it is more frequently 
taught by the science teacher. There geography has 
not quite reached the status of a major subject, but is 
still treated as a secondary one, bearing especially upon 
history. This is no doubt due to the intense na- 
tional spirit pervading the whole system of education. 
History and geography are made to bring out the great- 
ness of the Fatherland, and to teach an _ intelligent 
patriotism. 
There is room for this ideal in the United States. 
The children of to-day will be the leaders of the nation 
thirty years hence. The future citizen should know 
the geography and history of his country. Pliny said 
long ago, ‘‘ It is a shameful thing to live in one’s native 
land and know it not.” Geography teaches the present 
environment, natural and human; history teaches the 
past. We must adapt ourselves to our present environ- 
ment by the light of the experience of the past. 
Before the nineteenth century, geographies, outside 
of the astronomical portion, were chiefly histories. Not 
much was known about the real geographical facts, and 
   
-P-A-G-E-295
CORRELATION 283 
so to make the books full and interesting a great deal of 
historical matter, though for the most part unrelated to 
geography, was brought in. Then came the revolt of 
geography and the establishment of its independence as 
a science. Then followed the period of dull geographies, 
consisting chiefly of gazetteer-like lists of bald facts. 
Ritter (died 1859), primarily a historian, brought back 
history into geography, but this time to show the true 
interaction and interrelation of the subjects. 
In the higher science of general geography to-day, 
there is much of world history, and of the philosophy of 
history. The elementary geographies, however, have 
not kept up with this movement, and only in late years 
do we find refreshing signs of this humanizing tendency. 
Correlation with Literature. — There is another way of 
putting life and interest into geography, and that is by 
correlation with literature. There is no good reason 
why the language of school geography should be dull and 
pedantic. But whatever the reason, few textbooks in 
geography “ read like a story.” 
The teacher can correct this fault in part by supple- 
menting with outside reading from standard authors. 
Good descriptions of scenery and places and narratives of 
geographic or historic incidents are as necessary as maps, 
pictures, and specimens to bring the real subject, the 
earth and its inhabitants, before the eye, and to create a 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
284 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
liking for the study. Some of this literature may be used 
by the teacher as inspiration and suggestion for oral de- 
scriptions. Some of it may be read in class, and some 
may be given to the children to read at home. In 
Chapter XXV will be found suggestions for suitable 
reading. 
More correlation with literature would help to correct 
the neglect of the esthetic element in geography. The 
teacher, so taken up with the necessary drill on the 
“dry bones” of geography, is apt to forget or to 
slight the brighter side of the subject. This is short- 
sighted, since interest and pleasure in study reduce the 
effort of both pupil and teacher. By pointing out the 
beauties of the local landscape, by showing pictures of 
scenery of other places, and by oral description or by 
reading good descriptions, this esthetic appreciation 
of the earth could be cultivated. 
The desire to enjoy scenery is a chief reason for travel, 
and this travel instinct may be aroused and utilized 
in the pupils by presenting the picturesque and the 
majestic in geography. What a pity to give a child 
no further notion of the grandeur of a mountain than 
he gets from a definition like, ‘‘ Mountains are much 
higher than hills,” or, “‘ Mountains are folds in the earth’s 
crust.”’ Contrast the effect of the following account from 
Bayard Taylor’s description of The Austrian Alps, 
in Views Afoot: 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
CORRELATION 285 
We started next morning to ascend the Schafberg, which is 
called the Righi of the Austrian Switzerland. It is somewhat 
higher than its Swiss namesake, and commands a prospect scarcely 
less extensive or grand. We followed a footpath through the 
thick forest by the side of a roaring torrent. The morning mist 
still covered the lake, but the white summits of the Salzburg 
and the Noric Alps, opposite us, rose above it and stood pure and 
bright in the upper air. We passed a little mill and one or two 
cottages, and then wound round one of the lesser heights into a 
deep ravine, down in whose dark shadow we sometimes heard the 
axe and saw of the mountain woodmen. Finally the path dis- 
appeared altogether under a mass of logs and rocks, which appeared 
to have been whirled together by a sudden flood. We deliberated 
what to do. The summit rose several thousand feet above us, 
almost precipitously steep, but we did not like to turn back, and 
there was still a hope of meeting with the path again. Clambering 
over the ruins and rubbish, we pulled ourselves by the limbs of 
trees up a steep ascent and descended again to the stream... . 
The side was very steep, the trees all leaned downward, and we 
slipped at every step on the dry leaves and grass. After making a 
short distance this way with the greatest labor we came to the 
track of an avalanche which had swept away the trees and earth. 
Here the rock had been worn rough by torrents, but by using both 
hands and feet we clomb directly up the side of the mountain, 
sometimes dragging ourselves up by the branches of trees where the 
rocks were smooth. After half an hour of such work we came above 
the forests, on the bare side of the mountain. The summit was 
far above us, and so steep that our limbs shrank involuntarily 
from the task of climbing. The side ran up at an angle of nearly 
sixty degrees, and the least slip threw us flat on our faces. We had 
to use both hand and foot, and were obliged to rest every few 
minutes to recover breath. Crimson-flowered moss and blue 
gentians covered the rocks, and I filled my books with blossoms 
for my friends at home. 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
286 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Up and up for what seemed an age we clambered... . I let 
stones roll sometimes, which went down, down, almost like a 
cannon-ball, till I could see them no more. At length we reached 
the region of dwarf pines. .. . This forest, centuries old, reached 
no higher than our breasts. . . . Here and there lay patches of 
snow; we sat down in the glowing June sun, and bathed our 
hands and faces init. Finally the sky became bluer and broader, 
the clouds seemed nearer, and a few more steps through the bushes 
brought us to the summit of the mountain, on the edge of a preci- 
pice a thousand feet deep whose bottom stood in a vast field of 
snow. 
Je lay down on the heather, exhausted by five hours’ incessant 
toil, and we drank in like a refreshing draught the sublimity of the 
scene. The green lakes of the Salzburg Alps lay far below us, and 
the whole southern horizon was filled with the mighty range of 
the Styrian and Noric Alps, their summits of never-melting snow 
mingling and blending with the clouds. On the other side the 
mountains of Salzburg lifted their ridgy backs from the plains of 
Bavaria, and Chiem Lake lay spread out in the blue distance. A 
line of mist far to the north betrayed the path of the Danube, and 
beyond it we could barely trace the outlines of the Bohemian 
mountains. With a glass the spires of Munich, one hundred and 
twenty miles distant, can be seen. It was a view whose grandeur I 
can never forget. In that dome of the cloud we seemed to breathe 
a purer air than that of the earth. 
Accompanied with appropriate pictures a description 
like this is vastly more effective in arousing interest and 
developing a proper concept of what a mountain is 
than the usual stupid definition. Judgment must be 
used in not giving the children scenic descriptions or 
accounts of places which they cannot appreciate. Many 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
CORRELATION 287 
such were intended for adults only. Still, in general, de- 
scriptions of places and scenery, with a touch of human 
nature thrown in in the form of adventure or travel 
experiences, are acceptable, and have the advantage of 
emphasizing the feelings aroused by the beauty of the 
country, or by other characteristics. It is important 
that this descriptive literature have this emotional 
effect. It should carry the pupils away, — away from 
the printed page or the map to the real scenes portrayed. 
The usual supplementary readers are not referred to 
in this discussion of literature for correlation. They 
are not real literature, as their purpose is too didactic 
and their style too plain. The purpose of literature is 
never solely to impart information, but largely, if not 
chiefly, to give pleasure by an artistic, harmonious, and 
zsthetic use of language and ideas. 
Sources of literature for correlation. — Current periodi- 
cals contain a wealth of travel lore. Many books of 
travel are well written. Even the “ travelogues ”’ of the 
lecturers with the stereopticon are well worth reading 
in this connection. These lecturers certainly know 
how to appeal to their audiences and make their talks 
attractive, and teachers would do well to learn their 
secret. 
Geographical fiction. — Fiction, also, may be used 
as geographical matter. Many stories use a back- 
ground of fact, a natural setting, or definite regions or 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
288 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
places for the scene. Very beautiful and realistic de- 
scriptions in geography may thus be found in the tales 
of Cooper, Scott, Ebers, Kipling, Ralph Connor, etc., 
selections from which may be read in class. 
There is another class of stories with less of a geo- 
graphical basis, but which are excellent to arouse the 
imagination and the travel feeling. Such are Defoe’s 
Robinson Crusoe, Wyss’ Swiss Family Robinson, Verne’s 
Mysterious Island, Stevenson’s Treasure Island, and 
boy stories,” which 7 many other deservedly popular 
are full of adventure with natural conditions and at 
least suggest the adaptation of man to his environment, 
and the part played therein by invention. Many chil- 
dren, not otherwise interested in geography, may be 
aroused in this way. While portions of these books 
might be read in class, it is better to give them for 
home use. 
Biographical geography. — Connected with this are 
the lives and adventures of real explorers. The stories 
of the heroic men who braved the terrors of the Polar 
Sea, or the lives of the intrepid missionaries in America 
during the French settlement, or the fascinating accounts 
of Livingstone and of Stanley in Africa, not only present 
geographical information in an attractive and effective 
way, but teach something of the meaning of discovery, 
exploration, and the science of geography as well. The 
record of the men who thus ventured their lives appeals 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
CORRELATION 289 
to the hero worship of the children, and may have an 
uplifting effect on their character. 
Poetry in geography. — Finally, there is a place for 
poetry in geography; not the foolish doggerel intended 
as mnemonic aid for learning the names of places, but 
real poetry that expresses the elevated emotions and 
thoughts aroused by the beauty of scenery, or the awe 
of reflection on the majesty of the forces of nature, 
or the spiritual interpretation of earthly phenomena, 
or the lesson that may be drawn from them and applied 
to human life. The poets of all lands and all ages have 
felt the charm and grandeur of the earth, and have 
helped others also so to feel. There are many esthetic 
subjects in geography whose effect would be heightened 
by reading in class an appropriate poetical selection. 
In Europe this is done, — even singing is thus correlated.

CHAPTER XXII 
THE EVOLUTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL 
KNOWLEDGE 
The beginnings of geography are unrecorded, for 
geography is older than history. No doubt primitive 
tribes were familiar with their own locality, but with 
none far beyond that. Geography, however, includes, 
as a science, knowledge of distant, foreign regions. In 
this sense, the evolution of geography is codrdinate 
with the spread of civilization. 
Ancient geography. — The geographical wisdom of the 
earliest civilizations, that of the Chaldeans, Hebrews, and 
Egyptians, was limited to the region between the Persian 
Gulf and the desert of Egypt. These people were not 
inclined to travel, or to international trade. Their 
geography is recorded in their sacred books, for example 
in Genesis. They made a beginning in astronomical 
geography; the pyramids had, in part, at least, an 
astronomical function, and tablets with maps have 
been found in the ruins of Babylon. 
The Phoenicians, a Semitic race, driven by the Jews 
to the Mediterranean Coast, took refuge on islands and 
promontories (Tyre and Sidon), and learned the art of 
290 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
EVOLUTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE 291 
navigation. These restless people were great wanderers 
and merchants. They were the middlemen between the 
Western barbarians and the Asiatic civilization. They 
crept along the Mediterranean coast beyond the Pillars 
of Hercules (Gibraltar) and even, says tradition, to the 
Tin Islands (Britain). Yet extensive as was their 
journeying, we have it recorded only in tradition. 
The Homeric poems are an illustration of such tradi- 
tion. Aside from a rather limited amount of true 
Fia. 29.— The world as known in time of Homer, 900 B.c. 
geography, Homer’s epic contains much of fancy and of 
myth with which the less known parts of the earth were 
pictured. This geographical fiction of Homer probably 
had more weight in after times than the true geography. 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Homer imagined, as did also the Babylonians, that the 
earth was flat, round like a shield, and with a river, the 
Oceanus, flowing all around it. These notions prevailed 
for many centuries. 
The Greeks, in their expansion of empire, added 
to the known lands, especially in the east, as far as the 
Fig. 30.— The world as known by Hecateus, 500 B.c. 
Indus. Authentic writers of this period, such as He- 
rodotus, 450 B.C., gave good descriptions of the world 
as then known. The Greek map included all the Euro- 
pean Mediterranean countries, the Black Sea region, 
Asia Minor and western India, and northern Africa. 
Grecian astronomers held advanced ideas. They believed 
the earth spherical, and Eratosthenes of Alexandria, 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
EVOLUTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE 293 
240 B. C., by means of a shadow-stick, the gnomen, cal- 
culated the circumference of the earth as 245,000 stadia. 
The exact modern equivalent of a stadium is in dispute, 
and we do not know how accurate this estimate was, 
but the error was not great, as one stadium was ap- 
proximately equivalent to ten miles. 
The Greeks followed the steps of the Phoenicians in 
the Mediterranean and Asiatic commerce. For the 
benefit of the merchants peripli, or guidebooks of the 
coasts, were prepared. The oldest Greek map known 
is that of Hecatzeus, 500 B.c. 
Roman geography. — Next followed the rise and 
expansion of the Roman Empire. While the Romans 
jj

did not increase the bounds of the Greek geography, 
except toward the north and west, they developed the 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
294 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
knowledge of the interiors. Hitherto explorations had 
been littoral, except in Asia Minor. But the Romans 
explored the Hinterland, built splendid highways for 
military and commercial purposes, subdued and policed 
the semisavage tribes of western Europe, and by 
their stable government did much to foster trade and 
the growth of towns. Trade between the West and the 
East was extensive. In fact, commerce was the main 
impulse of the Roman expansion. Excellent road maps 
and coast peripli were prepared. 
The geographical knowledge of the Ancients is summed 
up in the works of two great writers, Strabo, 20 B.c., and 
Ptolemy, 150 A.D. (See next chapter.) 
The Middle Ages were, for geography, as for most learn- 
ing, the “‘ Dark Ages,” all the more so for the repeated 
destruction of the map of Europe by the almost constant 
warfare between the various tribes that were destined 
later to crystallize into nations. The population of 
Europe was in a state of flux for centuries. The Ger- 
manic barbarians overran the south of Europe. The 
fierce vikings of the North were invading and colonizing 
western Europe. The nations of France and England 
were being welded together from various tribes. A new 
force in the Western world were the invaders from Asia. 
The Moors took possession of Asia Minor, northern 
Africa, and Spain. The savage Mongols from the plains 
and plateaus of northern and central Asia pushed their 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
LUTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE 295 
empire through Russia to the banks of the Danube. 
All this incursion and ravaging must have utterly con- 
fused the geography of Europe, at least so far as the 
political map is concerned. 
Monastic geography.— This was preéminently a 
period of religious zeal, both for the Christian and the 
Saracen peoples. The learning of the former was at 
this time strictly ecclesiastic, and the wisdom of the 
Ancients was despised and forgotten. Geography was 
colored and modified to suit religious views. The 
Homeric flat, circular earth and surrounding ocean were 
revived. Distant lands and the “‘ Sea of Darkness,”’ the 
Atlantic, and the torrid zone were invested with frightful 
monsters and natural terrors that for many centuries 
deterred the most adventurous explorers. 
The Saracens, on the other hand, had absorbed much 
of the classical learning of Byzantium and Alexandria, 
and strove in the universities in Spain to maintain it. 
These schools were the chief centers of thought in the 
Dark Ages. Their geography was essentially that of 
Strabo and Ptolemy. The Arabs were the chief navi- 
gators of the Mediterranean and Indian seas at this 
period, and there were among them great travelers and 
geographers, but owing to the Saracen language in which 
they wrote their geographical descriptions, these had not 
great weight in Europe. 
The crusades spread geographical knowledge. — In 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
296 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
another way, though indirectly, the Saracens aided geo- 
graphical knowledge. The Holy Land was in their 
possession. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, 
especially, a religious fervor seized Europe, and many 
crusaders went to Palestine, sometimes to be met with 
resistance by the Saracens, and again to be met on more 
friendly terms. At any rate, these crusades did much to 
revive an interest in foreign lands, and to promote 
commercial intercourse between the West and the East. 
Marco Polo. — In connection with the pilgrimages and 
crusades there was considerable travel by monks, curious 
travelers, and merchants. The most romantic of these 
medieval travels was that of Marco Polo toward the 
end of the thirteenth century. As above stated, the 
Mongols or Tartars had overrun eastern Europe. West- 
ern rulers sought to form alliances with the powerful 
Mongol Khans or kings, and sent embassies to their 
semibarbaric court in far-off Cathay (China). On one 
of these embassies went Marco Polo, then a young man 
under twenty, a native of Venice. To the impressionable 
youth the journey overland through Central Asia, and 
his long years of favor and honor at the Chinese.court, 
must have been exceedingly novel and interesting. After 
long years he returned to his native city to relate and 
publish a remarkable story of travel and adventure 
which fired the imagination of all Europe. 
The Isles of Spices. — The East had always held men 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
EVOLUTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE 297 
in thrall. They knew that Asia was of vast extent, and 
stories of Cathay and Cipango (Japan), and the Spice 
Islands (the East Indies) had long floated about. More 
tangible were the luxuries that indirectly and through 
many lands, overland and by sea, came from the Orient. 
Silks and cotton, gems and gold, from India; perfumes 
and spices from the Islands of the East; medicines and 
dye-stuffs from Arabia, were eagerly sought by Western 
traders. The spices, alone, at this time made the nations 
strive for a monopoly in the trade. Salt is so highly 
esteemed that races risk their lives to secure it. Almost 
equally great was the demand for the spices of the East. 
We who have the modern variety of palatable, mixed 
dietary can hardly imagine how important was the need 
of spices for the people of those days when salt meat 
and salt fish were the staple articles of food and needed 
something to render them appetizing. The popular 
spices of this period were nutmeg, cloves, pepper, cin- 
namon, and ginger. -Camphor, spikenard, myrrh, and 
musk were the aromatics most in demand. 
Oriental trade routes. —The Chinese had long been 
in communication with the tropical Archipelagoes, and 
the cargoes they brought from there, together with their 
own silks, etc., they sold to the Arab traders who made 
regular sailings, according to the monsoons, to Singapore. 
These Arabs controlled the marine trade of the Indian 
Ocean, Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea. Tropical prod-

in turn, the Greeks, Genoese, and Venetians, had the 
monopoly of the Mediterranean commerce, distributing 
the Oriental goods from the eastern ports all along the 
coast. The further distribution then proceeded up the 
chief rivers and overland into the interior. 
There was an extensive overland trade from Asia. 
From China caravans used to travel through Mongolia 
and Turkestan, around both ends of the Caspian Sea 
to the Black Sea, where the goods were then shipped 
by water for the south of Europe. A land route from 
India ran through Mesopotamia, and then divided at 
Damascus, one branch leading to the Mediterranean 
ports, and the other to Constantinople. From the 
latter city one route of commerce ran across the Balkan 
Peninsula to the Danube, Germany, and the North Sea. 
Another route from Constantinople crossed Macedonia, 
and followed the Adriatic up to Venice. Italy was 
traversed by a trade route along its western side, which 
connected Rome and Genoa, and then led around to 
Marseilles, up the Rhone, across France to Britain. 
Venice was also connected with this last route, and 
also with the route from Constantinople to the Hanseatic 
towns of the northwest. 
Italian trade monopolies, — The Italian cities, espe-

cially Genoa and Venice, by “cut-throat ”’ competition, 
secured and held the monopoly of the Oriental trade 
from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries. Genoa 
had the monopoly of the northerly routes to the Black 
Sea and Constantinople ; and Venice, the southern routes 
to Palestine and Alexandria. Both cities became very 
wealthy and powerful. 
The westward route to the Indies. — Italy and the 
Levant having the monopoly of the eastern trade over 
the direct routes, the western nations began to seek 
another route to this field of riches. This became all 
the more necessary after the Turks captured Constan- 
tinople (1453) and Alexandria, thus closing the eastern 
route of commerce. 
Portuguese discoveries. — About the beginning of the 
fifteenth century Portugal, under the scientific and pious 
Prince Henry, called The Navigator, was the first thus 
to seek a new way to the Indies. It was natural that 
Henry should think that the way might lead through 
the Atlantic. He saw the possibility of rounding Africa. 
The old maps always showed a river (the ancient 
Oceanus), or an ocean south of that continent, and the 
medieval maps represented it much smaller than it 
really is. Thus encouraged, Henry proceeded to do 
what no one else had done before, namely, to develop the 
art of oceanic navigation. True, the Norsemen had 
crossed the North Atlantic in their long ships from island 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
EVOLUTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE 301 
to island; and Greek and Arab sailors had learned to 
sail boldly across the Indian Ocean, taking advantage 
of the periodic monsoons. But the open sea, especially 
the Atlantic, had always had its real or imaginary terrors 
for western sailors, and men did not trust themselves to 
sail beyond the horizon. The old legends and old maps 
told of human and animal monsters. The torrid zone, it 
was believed, could not be crossed on account of the 
fiery heat, while far out beyond the horizon one would 
come to the edge of the earth. Henry taught Europe 
the groundlessness of these fears. He built larger sea- 
going vessels, perfected the mariner’s compass, which 
not long before had been introduced, probably from 
China, by pivoting it in a box; he improved the astro- 
labe, for determining latitude; he built an astronomical 
observatory ; founded a school of navigators; and em- 
ployed the best cartographers of Europe. 
Circumnavigation of Africa. — Under the urging of 
Henry, Portuguese sailors pushed, year after year, 
farther down the coast of Africa. Excellent pilot 
charts, portolanos, were made of the newly discovered 
coasts, and in the end, 1497, the circumnavigation of 
Africa was accomplished by Vasco da Gama, and the 
new route to the Spice Islands established, but not until 
after the death of the Sailor Prince and Columbus’ bold 
venture. The African coasts were exploited by the 
Portuguese ; gold, ivory, and slaves were brought thence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Portuguese colonies were planted in Africa, Ceylon, 
India, and the East Indies, and soon this western na 
had taken away from the Italian and Egyptian citi 
the Oriental trade they so long enjoyed. 
The Norsemen. — In the tenth and eleventh centuries 
the Norsemen scoured the northern seas in their stanch 
viking ships, pillaging, conquering, and colonizing 
at various points on the coasts of western Europe. 
Some ventured out into the colder waters of the North 
Atlantic and discovered Iceland, Greenland, and 
even North America. Colonies were established in 
these regions. But nothing came of these achievements 
at the time. No other nations seem to have heard of 
the discoveries of the Norsemen. Even their own 
people forgot them, except as they are recorded in the 
legendary sagas 
Columbus. — The story of the discovery of America 
is familiar. Columbus evidently did not fear the mythi- 
cal monsters believed in by so many of his day, and he 
accepted the theory of the sphericity of the earth, a 
knowledge of which had been revived by the Moors, 
and by the Greeks who fled from the Turks at the sack- 
ing of Constantinople and Alexandria. Columbus held 
the Ptolemaic idea of the smallness of the earth, especially 
as to the shortness of the distance to the Indies by way 
of the Atlantic westward. The maps of Toscanelli and 
Behaim showed China only four thousand miles west of 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
EVOLUTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE 303 
Europe. He was therefore all the more ready to try to 
sail east by going west. His object was not to discover 
a new continent, but to find a new route to the East 
Indies, India, and China. He was never disillusioned of 
the notion that he had really discovered these regions, 
and the names, American Indians and the West Indies, 
stand to-day as a monument of this error. Columbus, 
however, set an example which was soon emulated by 
others. The fifteenth century gave the Old World a 
New World, and vastly enlarged its geographial concep- 
tion. 
Magellan. — The first circumnavigation of the earth 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
304 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
was accomplished by the great voyage of Magellan’s 
ships, 1519-1522. This gave a practical proof of the 
earth’s sphericity, also of the fact that Eurasia was 
smaller and the earth larger than had been believed. 
Incidentally the voyage also clinched the fact that 
America was a distinct continent. 
The Discoveries Period. — The century and a 
quarter beginning with the year 1400 is known as the 
Discoveries Period. The broadening of geographical 
knowledge, and the stimulus to the imagination must 
have done much toward bringing on the Renaissance. 
By 1550 practically all the continental shores of the world 
were known, with the exception of those of Australia and 
the polar lands. 
Motives of exploration. — It is interesting to pause to 
consider the motives that have led men to brave the 
dangers of unknown regions. For the most part they 
were commercial — for gain. The Phoenician peddlers 
traveled the Mediterranean countries for gain, and 
earned an unenviable reputation for sharp bargaining. 
The Greeks and Romans conquered empires in order to 
exploit them commercially. Semibarbarian Teutons, 
Norsemen, Vandals, and Huns erupted from their native 
countries for plunder. Migration and colonization 
are usually the result of necessity, the need of more 
productive fields than the home country affords, or per- 
haps overpopulation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
EVOLUTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE 305 
The trader sometimes preceded the discoverer, at least 
soon followed in his track. The quest for the East was 
mainly for commerce. The item of spice alone was 
responsible for great overland journeys through Asia, 
for the exploration of the Indian Ocean, for the circum- 
navigation of Africa, and the discovery of America. 
That there were other motives cannot be denied. 
Alexander and the Czsars, no doubt, loved power and 
conquest. The Saracens were imbued with a fiery re- 
ligious frenzy when they swept through Asia and Africa, 
giving their vanquished foes the choice of Islam or the 
sword. The Christians of Europe, during the Middle 
Ages, pressed as pilgrims and crusaders through the 
troubled and dangerous chaos of countries, actuated by 
religious zeal. And some, like Herodotus, Strabo, and 
Marco Polo, traveled because they were curious, and 
liked to travel. 
With the seventeenth century, however, a new motive 
for exploration developed, which does not mean, though, 
that other motives did not continue as in the past. The 
new motive was that of scientific research, the desire to 
discover for the sake of the discovery. For this purpose 
the great nations have maintained geographical societies, 
which encouraged such exploration, and governments 
have frequently sent out scientific expeditions. 
Captain James Cook. Australia. — Prince Henry is 
credited with such uncommercial motives, though his 
ba 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
3 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
merchant sailors did not share them. With Captain 
James Cook’s voyages, 1770-1776, scientific exploration 
really began. In 1542 the Spanish, in search for the 
Spice Islands, discovered Australia, but its insular 
character was not known for two hundred years. Fora 
long time it was thought to be the fabled Southern Con- 
tinent around the South Pole, hence the name Australia 
(auster, south). The Dutch, who in the sixteenth 
century displaced the Portuguese in the Indian waters, 
had explored the south and west coast. It was left for 
Captain Cook to complete the coastal survey. He 
also discovered New Zealand, and many other islands 
of the Pacific. He was slain by the Hawaiians, 1776. 
Africa. — The opening up of the Dark Continent was 
the work of the nineteenth century. The explorations 
of Mungo Park, Livingstone, and Stanley in Africa were 
also scientific. The tropical heat, the dense forests, 
and tropical diseases called for a heroism and _ per- 
severance of the highest order in these pioneers. 
The polar regions have always had a peculiar fascina- 
tion for mankind. The hardy Norsemen were the first 
to discover the Arctic lands of Iceland, Greenland, and 
Labrador. After the successful exploits of the Portuguese 
and Spaniards during the Discoveries Period, France, 
England, and Holland emulated their example, trying to 
find new routes to India. The Northwest Passage to 
India was attempted by each of these nations, resulting 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
EVOLUTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE 307 
only in defeat, so far as their primary purpose was 
concerned, yet adding to the geography of the Arctic 
seas. 
During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the 
scientific motive prevailed in the exploration of polar 
regions. Some of the saddest and finest stories of heroic 
endeavor have been written in these frozen seas. 
The destiny of the Russian Empire led to the east, 
through the frozen tundras, and the fertile plains of 
Siberia to the Pacific. It was the Russian commander 
Behring, 1728, who proved the separation of Asia 
from North America, by sailing through the strait that 
now bears his name. In 1879 Nordenskiold successfully 
sailed the Northeast Passage, around Europe and Asia; 
while Collinson, in 1850-1855, and Amundsen, in 1903- 
1906, worked their ships through the tortuous shoals 
of the Northwest Passage, long sought for, and long 
abandoned as a possible commercial route. 
The early years of the twentieth century saw the settle- 
ment of the question of the Poles. Peary, 1909, found 
the North Pole in the midst of the Arctic Ocean; and 
Amundsen, 1911, the South Pole on a glacier-covered 
plateau of the Antarctic Continent. 
“ The final achievement of the Pole will not give us 
another pound of whalebone, nor will it open up any new 
route of navigation; it will simply add to useless knowl- 
edge.... Most knowledge is at first profitless for food

  308 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
and shelter, but it is exhilarating to the soul just the 
same.” (The Independent.) 
Further exploration. — The general map of the globe 
is complete. Yet there still remains work for the 
geographer. Much of the interior of continents still 
requires exploration. Vast areas need careful survey- 
ing. Problems of geology, climate, plant and animal 
life, and ethnographical questions are still to be solved. 
And man and his ways, and the beauty of the natural 
scenery, will always appeal to the geo-historian.

CHAPTER XXIII 
THE HISTORY OF THE SCIENCE OF GEOGRAPHY, 
AND THE HISTORY OF ITS PEDAGOGY 
Geography as a science. — We have seen how the 
knowledge of the extent and appearance of the world 
increased with the migration of races, with conquest, 
commercial expansion, and religious crusades, and 
through scientific exploration. The new facts thus 
acquired by the world were recorded from time to time 
in the books as geography. 
The orderly, logical account of the knowledge of the 
extent, appearance, and life conditions of the earth; and 
of the habits of its forms of life, particularly its peoples, 
is the science of geography. It attempts to bring out 
the relations that exist between the various geographical 
factors or features, and, as far as possible, tries to find 
out underlying principles. Geography as a science has 
necessarily lagged behind discovery. 
The data of geography. —It is the duty of the scientific 
geographer to scrutinize, weigh, and harmonize the ac- 
counts of travelers, the data of commerce, and the more 
scientific records of explorers, surveyors, and scientists. 
It is not an easy matter to thus compile a science correct 
309 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
310 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
in all respects. Insufficient data, inaccurate obser- 
vations, accounts colored by partisanship or bias, 
pure fiction and superstition, have always entered into 
the science of geography, and these errors of the human 
judgment have not yet been all eradicated. 
Mathematical geography is the oldest branch of the 
science of geography. The Chaldeans, Chinese, Hindoos, 
Jews, and Egyptians made the first contributions, giv- 
ing us geometry, the idea of a spherical earth, circular 
measure, the calendar, knowledge of the eclipses, and the 
first measurements of the earth. 
Herodotus. — The Greeks were the first to write scien- 
tific descriptions of the earth in general. Herodotus, 
450 B.C., summarized the existing knowledge of his own 
and foreign lands, and the earth in general. Eratos- 
thenes, 240 B.C., wrote a comprehensive geography, and 
made the first mathematical measurement of the earth. 
Strabo. — The Romans were too busy developing their 
conquered territories commercially to allow the writing 
of geography. They had maps and accounts of their 
newly acquired possessions which were set up at the 
time of the celebration of their victories. But they 
did not write any systematic geography. This was left 
for two Greeks of the Empire to do. 
Strabo, 20 B.c., wrote a great work on the geography 
of his time. It was a philosophical, scientific, systematic 
treatise, divided into mathematical, physical, and po- 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
HISTORY OF THE SCIENCE OF GEOGRAPHY 311 
litical branches, thus setting a standard that has been 
followed to this day. He appreciated the effect of the 
environment on the people, but used geography as an 
aid to history. He has been called the Father of 
Geography. 
Ptolemy. — But the most influential figure in ancient 
geography was Claudius Ptolomeus (Ptolemy), a Greek, 
of Alexandria, 150 a.D. He believed in a spherical 
earth, but made it the center of the universe, an idea 
that was destined to prevail for 1500 years. He wrote 
a great work on mathematical geograp and in the 
famous library at Alexandria he made a critical study of 
the geographical data acquired up to that time, and pre- 
pared his great map of the world. He used meridians 
and parallels, fixing the prime meridian at the Canary 
Islands, then the farthest west, where it was kept till 
the eighteenth century. He estimated, but with error, 
the latitude and longitude of places, and placed them 
upon the map. He overestimated the extent of Eurasia, 
assuming it to be from west to east larger by more than 
75 degrees than it really is, thus leaving the distance 
west from Europe to China too small. 
Ancient school geography. — As far as school instruc- 
tion in geography is concerned, the ancients have but 
little to show. Geography hardly existed as a separate 
science, but was blended with history, astronomy, and 
geometry, in which there was probably some reference 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
312 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
to descriptive and mathematical geography. Socrates 
is said to have used a map in teaching his disciples, and 
the Romans set up in public places tablets of maps 
descriptive of their conquests. 
During the Middle Ages geography as a science 
followed the general decline of learning. The best 
geography of the ancients, Strabo’s and Ptolemy’s, 
was neglected, and inferior data were accepted, even 
the mythology of Homer being revived. The errors of 
Ptolemy were preserved because they fitted well with 
the Christian cosmography. The monks copied and 
made excerpts from inferior works. Their maps, mappe- 
mundi, were marvels of inaccuracy, legendary lore, 
and superstition, representing a strictly ecclesiastical 
interpretation of the world. Jerusalem was generally 
placed at the center of the map. The road maps were 
somewhat better, but chiefly intended for pilgrims, 
and comprised mainly a list of “holy places.” 
The Renaissance saw the voyages of the Portuguese 
and the Spaniards. A new spirit came into all science, 
including geography. Pretentious, systematic ‘“‘ Cos- 
mographies ”’ were written. One of these, 1507, by 
the German Waldseemiiller, fixed upon the New World 
the name “ America.” The German geographers were 
especially active. Cartography was developed to a 
high degree by Gerhard Kramer (Latin, Mercator), 
1512-1594, who invented various projections, the so- 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
HISTORY OF THE SCIENCE OF GEOGRAPHY 313 
called Mercator’s Projection being the most famous. 
Behaim, also, constructed his first globe in 1492. This 
does not show the new world, to be discovered that 
same year. 
Copernicus. — In this period physics and astronomy 
were greatly advanced. Copernicus, 1543, revolution- 
ized previous astronomical notions (Ptolemaic system) 
of a geocentric universe, by substituting the present 
heliocentric theory. This, with the new Discoveries 
of Lands, caused the loosening of the grip of the classic 
geography on the minds of men. 
Pedagogy of geography in the Middle Ages. — During 
the Middle Ages geography was still largely a part of 
astronomy, history, geometry, or even religion, and was 
taught in connection with them. The chief pedagogical 
improvement was in the use of maps and globes, though 
none were yet used in elementary schools. 
Philosophic geography. — With the modern period 
came a number of geniuses who dealt with the philosophy 
of the earth and its place in the universe. Varenius, of 
Amsterdam, 1622-1650, wrote the first general physical 
geography, in a very modern way, using the causal 
relation and the comparative method. It was for a 
century the standard of general geography, and was 
translated by the great Newton for students in English 
universities. Varenius was the founder of physical 
geography. Newton (d. 1727) himself contributed to 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
314 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
the science of geography the law of gravity and or- 
bital motion. Kant (d. 1804) and Laplace (d. 1827) 
proposed the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the earth. 
Anthropogeography, the place of man on the earth, his 
relation to his environment, was first considered fully 
by Herder, in his Philosophy of History, 1785. 
Beginnings of modern methods of instruction. — 
During this period of discovery and commercial ex- 
pansion there was more need for geography, and a 
beginning was made with instruction in this subject in 
the elementary schools. By 1600 some textbooks of 
geography had been written for German schools. Co- 
menius (d. 1671) urged this study upon the schools, 
emphasizing home geography as the beginning, geog- 
raphy of one’s native country, and the use of pictures 
(Orbis Pictus). 
Rousseau. — It was in the next century, however, that 
the pedagogy of geography received serious considera- 
tion. This was a period of revolt against formalism 
and bookishness in education. The school of educators 
represented by Rousseau (d. 1778) demanded naturalness 
in education, and emphasized the humanities. Rousseau 
spoke against the emphasis usually placed on mathe- 
matical geography. He said the children of his day could 
glibly locate foreign places, but could not find the way 
from their home city to the next town. ‘“ Why begin 
with celestial and terrestrial globes, and maps? Why 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
HISTORY OF THE SCIENCE OF GEOGRAPHY 315 
these symbols? Why not begin with the earth itself, 
the home locality, so that pupils may know what they 
are studying about? ”’ said Rousseau. He gave a great 
impetus to the learning of home geography by observa- 
tion, and helped to adapt the study to beginners. 
Francke. — Under the direction of Francke (d. 1727) 
in Germany, geography assumed a firm place in the 
curriculum of the higher school as a distinct subject. 
The textbooks then in use were of the question and 
answer form, and atlases were separate. 
Basedow (d. 1790) wrote the first illustrated textbook 
of geography, beginning with home geography. He 
also used current events, imaginary journeys, and 
supplementary reading, and correlated with nature- 
study, —all decidedly modern. 
Herder, above mentioned, as superintendent of 
schools, lent his influence in establishing the young sub- 
ject, in promoting home geography, and giving it a 
human tendency. 
The eighteenth century must be considered as most 
revolutionary and progressive in the matter of the 
pedagogy of geography. 
Pestalozzi (d. 1827) did not carry his theories of child 
psychology and concrete instruction into practice in 
geography. He did not use maps, and his method of 
instruction in geography was very formal. He taught, 
for example, alphabetic lists of place names before 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
316 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
anything was learned about them. Geography is, how- 
ever, indebted to him for his insistence on adapting 
instruction to the child, the observational method, 
and the synthetic order of study, which he applied to 
education in general, and especially for the inspiration 
of his disciples, who carried out his ideas in geography 
better than he himself could or did. 
Correlation of geography with natural science. — The 
eighteenth century had been rich in discovery and ex- 
ploration. The geographers of the nineteenth century 
had to collect and sift the new material and to correlate 
the new geography with the new sciences of botany, 
zodlogy, meteorology, and geology, which were rapidly 
developing. Hugh Murray (d. 1846) in England, and 
Conrad Malte-Brun (d. 1826) in France, were leaders 
in this new movement in scientific geography. 
Modern geography, as a science, was founded by Karl 
Ritter (d. 1859). He was a scientific geographer and 
historian, and a great teacher. He, more than any one 
else before, realized the intimate relation between man 
and nature, and made this the means of uniting into an 
organic unity what had up to this time been largely a 
mass of unrelated facts. This idea he expressed in 
numerous works, particularly in his Geography in Re- 
lation to the Nature and History of Man. 
He emphasized the necessity of using physical geog- 
raphy as the basis of political geography and history. 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
HISTORY OF THE SCIENCE OF GEOGRAPHY 317 
He coined the expression “ comparative geography,” 
meaning a comparison of the physical features of one 
country with similar features in another, therefrom de- 
riving some common principles. He not only wrote 
works on the science of geography, but labored with his 
contemporaries to adopt his ideas and to make of geog- 
raphy a cultural and disciplinary study, which to this 
time it had scarcely been. He taught the Pestalozzian 
doctrine of beginning the subject with the child’s natural 
environment. He urged home geography. He insisted 
on map drawing. No other man has had such an in- 
fluence in shaping geographical science and geographical 
instruction. His ideals still hold good to-day. 
Humboldt. — Another great influence in geography 
at this period was that of Humboldt (d. 1859), a 
great naturalist and explorer, and author of Cosmos. 
While Ritter was led to geography through history, 
Humboldt came to it through natural science, and his 
works naturally reflect this interest. He emphasized 
the physical side of geography. He made altitude 
studies, and invented profiles and isotherms, and 
developed the subject of plant geography. 
Ratzel. — Among the Ritter school, Ratzel (d. 1904), 
author of Anthropogeography, was (after Ritter) the 
greatest. He emphasized the human, the historic, and 
also the esthetic side of geography. Through his 
vivid, interesting, and appealing description of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
318 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
earth he raised the subject of geography to the esthetic 
plane. 
The ‘‘ New Geography.” — With the new development 
of the sciences in the nineteenth century, particularly 
in geology and biology, since the days of Darwin and 
Huxley, 1870, there has been a tendency to swing away 
from the humanistic treatment of geography as repre- 
sented by Ritter, Peschel, Ratzel, and Guyot, toward 
the physical side. The Ritter school treated the subject 
of physical geography scenically and statically, as if 
the earth’s topography did not change, and mountains 
were everlasting. The ‘‘new geography,” however, 
treats geography dynamically. The forces of the earth 
receive more attention, and their effects are noted. 
The new geography looks backward for explanations 
of the present features, and forward to ultimate condi- 
tions. The causal treatment marks the subject to-day. 
In short, it is evolutionary in character. The Ritter 
school considered the earth adapted to man, the teleo- 
logical view; the modern school considers man’s life, 
like that of other creatures, plants, and animals, as a 
response to, or determined by, physical nature. The 
tendency is thus to magnify physical nature, and to 
minimize man. This tendency is shown, perhaps, more 
in the United States than elsewhere. William M. 
Davis is the chief representative. 
Regional geography. — One consequence, a good one, 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
HISTORY OF THE SCIENCE OF GEOGRAPHY 319 
of viewing more fully the physical side of the earth, 
is the present-day tendency to drop the old systematic 
treatment of geography by countries and states, or at 
least to supplement it by studying the earth by physio- 
graphic regions, or industrial units, which is really 
an application of the comparative method in the higher 
sense. 
Modern specialization. — Geography has become so 
broad a science that one mind is scarcely able to treat it 
adequately in all departments. Hence there is a growing 
tendency to specialize in one branch or another. One 
of the newer branches is commercial geography, em- 
phasized especially in this country and in England. 
The rise of this subject has been brought about by the 
tremendous material development of the world in the 
last fifty years. Its introduction in the schools is in 
response to a demand from the business world. 
Two tendencies in geography. — Ever since geography 
began to be written two tendencies or two schools existed, 
usually side by side, sometimes one predominating, 
sometimes the other. They are the humanistic and 
physical interpretations of geography. The character 
of the instruction in the elementary schools usually 
reflected the two tendencies, though always lagging 
behind. 
Geography in the curriculum. — Geography is to-day 
a highly accredited subject, with a large allowance of 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
320 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
time in the curriculum in all enlightened countries. 
In England and America it stands on its own footing 
and should really be correlated far more than it is with 
history and nature-study. In Germany and France 
geography is still in the shadow of history, being very 
closely woven together with that subject, especially in 
the study of the Fatherland. , 
Home and general geography are taught in the ele- 
mentary grades; physical and commercial geography, 
in the higher school and university. 
In Europe there are chairs of political geography in the 
universities, and it is taught in secondary schools. This 
branch, most unfortunately, is below par in this country, 
receiving scarcely any attention above the elementary 
school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
CHAPTER XXIV 
SOME AMERICAN TEXTBOOKS OF GEOGRAPHY 
The first geographies used in this country were “ made 
in England.” The character of these early textbooks 
may be judged from Geography Made Familiar and Easy, 
by J. Newberry, 1748, London. This or a similar title 
was a favorite form at the time. Geography was still 
pleading for a place among the studies. Hence these 
early books generally contained in their preface “ argu- 
ments to recommend the study of a science so useful 
and entertaining.” Newberry’s geography, like many 
others up to 1850, was of the question and answer 
type, a method followed first by the German Hiibner 
in his geographies, and probably borrowed from church 
pedagogy. In fact, some of these textbooks were entitled 
“ Geographical Catechism.” As the main object of 
the textbooks of this period was to teach names and lo- 
cations — “‘sailor’s geography,” the catechism method 
was an orderly and expeditious, if not interesting, 
method of memorizing. Says the author of another 
primer of geography, J. Johnston, London, 1787, “ Chil-

should be improved by the former,” and he claims

TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Unpedagogical treatment. — Aside from names and lo- 
cations, Newberry’s book consisted of general definitions, 
some mathematical geography (largely globe exercises), 
and a very slender description of countries. The book 
started out with general definitions and mathematical 
geography, and then followed with a deductive applica- 
tion, a method wholly unsuited to beginners. 
The book, like many others of its time, was of the 
“vest pocket ”’ size, an interesting commentary on the 
amount of geography required in those days. The book 
had no pictures and no maps, except a frontispiece of 
the world in hemispheres. It was the custom then to 
use a separate atlas with the textbooks. 
Morse, the Father of American Geography. — The 
first really American geography was written by the 
Rev. Jedidiah Morse, New Haven, 1774. It was called 
Geography Made Easy. Morse is called the Father of 
-American Geography, and it is to his credit that he 
emphasized the value of geography as a patriotic study 
for Americans, and a preparation for good citizenship. 
Morse’s book does not differ from the previous English 
texts, except in a better application to American geog- 
raphy. It has no pictures, only one map of the world, 
and one of North America. These are plain, copper 
plate cuts. The political part is better than the rest, 
containing some history, and descriptions of customs to 
enliven its dull monotony. Inspite of its limitations this

Q. 41. Why are these constellations called by such ani- 
mals’ names? 
_A_ Those who divided the starry heavens into constella- 
tions, must call them by some nuine, to know and distinguish 
them by; and the several clusters thus laid off, probably 
bear some resemblance to the animals on Earth whose names 
they wear. 
Q. 42. What do you mean by the Sun entering the 12

path the Sun describes, and never quits, while he passes 
through the twelve signs, as above described. 
Q. 44. What causes an eclipse of the Sun? 
A. An eclipse of the Sun can never happen, but at the 
change of the Moon; and as the Moon continually wheels 
round the Earth left about, and completes ber revolution in 
her month; so it will sometimes happen, that im passing 
frum the east to the west of the Sun, she must comc betwixt

EACHING GEOGRAPHY 
sv A NEW SYS'TEM OF 
itants, but by numerous emigrations from New-England. 
The people of the northern counties are mostly from 
New-England. Though the English language is gener- 
ally spoken through the state ; yet in some parts it ig 
greatly corrupted by the Dutch. In some instances they 
yet have schools and.public worship conducted in the 
Dutch language, but the custom is going out of use, and 
soon no language will be spoken, but the English. The 
emigrants from New-England, it may be supposcd, retain 
the customs and manners of those states. Long island 
was also settled from EnglanJ or New-England ; but the 
other parts of the state differ considerably in character 
from New-England. Beside the Dutch, many Germans 
arc scttled on the Mohawk ; on the Hudson are Scotch 
setilcrs. In the city of New-York are found many Ger- 
mans and Scotch. In New-Rochelle, and on Staten’s isl- 
and, many French emigrants are settled. All those peo- 
ple in some degree retain the customs, manners, and 
©pinions of the countries, whence they came. The in- 
habitants in 1800 were 586,050, of whom 20,613 were 
slaves. The militia, in 1808, were 92,564. 
Climate-—The northern part of the state resembles 
Vermont ; but is more mild, owing to the great lakes in 
the vicinity. West of the Alleghany mountains the sea-. 
sons are temperate. On the lower part of the Hudson 
and the sound, the weather is very changeable. 
Towns.—New-York is the capital of the state, situated 
on the southwest point of Manhattan island, and contains 82,000 inhabitants. The houses in general are of brick, 
with tiled roofs. Federal hall is the most superb build- 
ing in the city ; it is occupied by the legislature, and ju- 
dicial courts. The state prison is a noble pile of build- 
ings, which does honour to the humanity and wisdom of 
the government, by whom it was erected. It is 307 feet in length, S stories high ; the lower story is 10 feet high, 
the other two 13 and a half each. The walls are thick, 
and of hard stone ; the grates are of iron bars, steeled, and hardened. There are in the city 26 houses for pub- lic worship, 3 Dutch churches, 4 presbyterian, 2 associated, 
reformed Scotch churches, 1 ussociated Scotch churchy 5 episcopal churches, 2 German Lutherans, and Calvinists, 
3 methodists, 2 baptists, and for Moravians, Roman cath- olics, French protestants, and Jews, one each. The hos- 
pital of New-York is a spactous building ; beside its oth

book enjoyed a tremendous popularity, passed through 
twenty-five editions, and was still in use in 1865. 
Revolt. — The gazetteers and catechisms finally 
brought on a revolt among teachers. They were criti- 
cized as too uninteresting, unpedagogical, unconnected, 
and too great a burden on the memory. 
In 1822 William Woodbridge published at Hartford 
his Rudiments of Geography “on the new plan of com- 
paring facts and arranging them in classes and reduc- 
ing them to general principles.” These principles were 
first stated, and next applied in a description of continents 
as wholes, and finally ina description of the states. This 
avoided repetition: “ The countries of the torrid zone 
produced fruits and vegetables. Therefore from the 
map the child can see what is raised in Hindoostan or 
Guinea.” The treatment is thus analytic-deductive. 
At the end of the book is a fair ‘‘ general view ” of 
physical features, manufacturing, commerce, and peoples. 
Evidently the author wished the pupil to exercise judg- 
ment as well as memory, and saw the value of comparison. 
He believed in pictures, though the woodcuts of the text 
are very crude and few. 
In many respects Woodbridge, who had a keen interest 
in geography, and belonged to several European geo- 
graphical societies, was ahead of his times, at least in 
America. And yet his book is, for the most part, dull. 
It is based chiefly on map:study (atlas) and the descrip- 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
328 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
tive text is very meager. From this time on map study 
became very prominent. 
Primary geography. — Thus far no attempt had been 
made to adapt the subject to child psychology. But 
by 1830 the influence of Pestalozzi and his school began 
to influence American education. The influence of Ritter 
in emphasizing the human element was also noticeable. 
One of the earliest books to attempt an adapta- 
tion to the beginner was Goodrich’s System of School 
Geography, 1836, Hartford, inspired by the monumental 
work of Malte-Brun in France. This little book begins 
with home geography, and then proceeds synthetically 
—inductively. The language, too, is simplified, and 
adapted to young readers, and there are numerous pic- 
tures. The mathematical geography is made very simple. 
The descriptive part makes historical connections, and 
leans towards the esthetic treatment. In these respects 
the book is pedagogically planned. But the map work 
is still chiefly locational, and at this period pupils were 
required to learn not only the states and their capitals, 
but the counties of each state and their shire towns. 
The book shows an advance in map study, in that, after 
a study of the separate states of a section, the section 
is reviewed as a group — a slight recognition of physio- 
graphic regions. Home geography, however, had not 
come to stay, because teachers were not prepared for it 
and did not understand its value.

330 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
About this time geography became graded into two, 
or sometimes three, books. Maps were now placed in 
the textbooks, instead of in a separate atlas. In general, 
the primary books were a blessed relief, when compared 
to the dull stuff that preceded. 
It is not to be expected that protests against these 
new-fangled methods, “‘ this puerile language,” were not 
heard. In Jacob Willett’s New and Improved School 
Geography, 1826, we read: “It has not been deemed 
expedient to sprinkle this book with pictures, from a 
conviction that they serve to divert the attention of 
the pupil rather than to inform his mind or improve his 
taste.” And so he goes back to the catechism style, 
without illustrations. 
Geographies of the mid-nineteenth century. — In 
1844, in New York, Sidney Morse, son of Jedidiah, 
Father of American Geography, published A System of 
Geography of the conventional formal sort. The chief 
merit of the book is the more logical and sensible map 
study. 
Morse advises teachers to drill first on the introductory 
pages of definitions and principles; next to go through 
the whole book, drilling on the maps; and then to 
go back and take up the descriptive text, — a German 
custom, and certainly systematic and orderly, whatever 
might be said of its interest and connectedness. 
The maps in this book were large, hence the book had

the usual atlas form. These maps were “the first made 
by the lithographic process” in colors, but this was 
xii PREFACE. 
which the compiler introduces here as cqually 
applicable to the use of his own :— 
_ “* The proper mode of using this litt'e book to 
advantage, will, itis apprehended, be, to let the 
pupil coinmit the whole of the facts to memory, 
at the rate, perhaps of one, two or three a day, 
according to his age and capacity; taking care at 
the end of each section, to make him repeat the 
whole of what he has before learnt” 
“Ln ‘connexion with this labor, he may be use- 
fully employed in examing the maps 3 aod in 
answering, In writirg, the questions that are for- 
med from them. Ifhe read over also a part of the 
vocabulary each day, coroparing the words with 
the places on some maps of a Targer scale than 
could be bound up with this grammar, it may be 
afficmed, that halfan hour only spent in this man- 
nerevery day, will render any youth fomiliac 
with geography in the course of a few months. 
“ He may then be called on to answer, without 
hesitation, the questions which are framed from 
and correspond with tbe facts stated in the gram- 
mar ; and if he be required to do this in writing, 
it will be the means of improving him io the art 
of composition, while it grounds him in all the 
fundamental principles uf Geography. 
© That part which relates to the use of the 
globes, aud which contains every fundamental 
problem, may be learnt at any time that the pre- 
ceptor shall see fit The questions founded on 
thr part will be1ound a us.ful and agreeable ex- 
ercise.”

well selected. Some of the earlier books had used 
different colors for the boundaries, but in this book the 
states were colored throughout. 
At this period spherical, orthographic, and conic maps 
were employed, but Mercator’s projection was not in 
general use. The illustrations of this period were very 
much improved. There were more numerous, more 
artistic woodcuts. They were also better related to 
the text than formerly. In some, as in Cornell’s geog- 
raphy, they were truly beautiful. 
The middle decades of the nineteenth century were a 
period of very formal geography. There was much 
drilling on maps, on unnecessary and unimportant de- 
tails, chiefly as to mere location, without much logical 
sequence. Map drawing was much insisted on, in fact, 
became a fetish. The pupils at any rate must have 
had the map well impressed on their memory. In 
Morse’s book and others, such as Monteith’s, Cornell’s, 
Smith’s, Colton’s, there was much classifying and sys- 
tematizing of the descriptive matter, so much so that 
it was chopped up into paragraphs without apparent 
connection or continuity. This made it easy to memo- 
rize, which seems still to have been considered the chief 
pedagogical principle in geography; but the vital and 
interesting relations between the facts of geography 
were lost. Reflection and judgment were discouraged, 
and memorizing was at a premium. 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
SOME AMERICAN TEXTBOOKS 333 
The books of the period differed among themselves 
mainly as to scope and emphasis on one topic or 
another. One made a hobby of mathematical geog- 
raphy, another of historical correlation, another of 
home geography, another of map study. 
Ritter’s influence in recognizing physical geography 
as related to human life was felt now in this country, 
and all texts were admitting that physical geography 
should be the basis of political, and therefore devoted 
space to it, but in a way so unconnected that it showed 
the real significance of this branch of geography had 
not yet been appreciated. None of them really apply 
the causal principle. 
Guyot. — In 1849 there began a rejuvenation of geog- 
raphy teaching when Guyot came from Switzerland to 
this country to lecture to teachers on the teaching of 
geography. He wasa disciple of Ritter, and had adopted 
the new primary methods of Pestalozzi. He broke away 
from the choppy, systematic, categoric treatment, and 
put life and unity into the subject. In collaboration 
with Mrs. Mary Howe Smith, of the then famous Oswego 
Normal School, he wrote a series of three graded geog- 
raphies, from 1866-1874, each of a distinct scope and 
order of treatment and designed for particular grades. 
The primary geography was not merely an abridgment 
of the higher, as had been so generally the case with the 
older “ series.”

The sea breezes render the air moist along the coast, The soil is 
generally fertile. The élimate is favorable to the growth of grass, 
* ‘The northern portions are yet covered with forests; the southern 
parts, toward the sea shore, present many. flourishing towns and 
villages. The state abounds in lakes and streams, but they are not 
well suited to navigation. Jt has an extensive sea coast, and many 
fine harbors, favorable to commercial pursuits. ‘The people have 
therefore, generally, neglected agriculture and manufactures, and 
devoted themselves to commerce. 
Many of the inhabitants of Maine are engaged in cutting down 
the forest trees, and converting them into lumber, which is shipped 
to the West Indies, and various parts of the United States, and 
exchanged for flour, sugar, cash, and other articles which the peo- 
ple have need of. This business, which is called the lumber trade, 
constitutes one of the leading occupations of the inhabitants. The 
following cvt represents men cutting down the trees in the back-

also a vessel, loading with lumber to carry it away. 
  
The people of Maine occasionally ship cargoes of ice to New

SOME AMERICAN TEXTBOOKS 335 
Guyot’s Introduction to Geography is a beautiful, in- 
teresting reader in geography. It takes the child 
about his home locality first, then on journeys farther 
and farther from home. Physical, scenic, commercial, 
and historic units or types are chosen for these journeys. 
These travels are finally unified and summarized so as 
to present a picture of the whole country. A marked 
feature is that maps are not used before, but after, a 
region has been thus traveled over with picture and text. 
The map work also is definite, and limited to essentials. 
Before the Guyot books came out only political maps 
had been used in textbooks. He introduced a color- 
physical map by combining it with the political. 
In Guyot’s Intermediate and Grammar School Geog- 
raphies the arrangement was analytical-deductive. Here 
physical geography was really brought to bear on the 
political. The map study was cut down to reasonable 
limits by a better selection, and was more than simply 
locative, being used for the development of topog- 
raphy, climate, etc., as well. Mercator’s projection was 
used in some of the physical maps. For the first time 
separate color-physical maps were used in addition to 
the political. 
Guyot and Smith were firm believers in map drawing, 
as were practically all authors and teachers of the time. 
They, however, made the mistake of recommending com- 
plicated construction diagrams, the formule for which

relegation of mathematical geography until after the 
home geography; finer cartography; a better applica- 
tion of physical geography ; the recognition of commer- 
cial geography; and the addition of state supplements. 
Representative texts of this period are those of Colton, 
Swinton, and Harpers. The latter made a special effort 
to emphasize the commercial side. 
The “new” geography emphasizes the physical. — In 
the nineties a number of textbooks appeared, such as 
Frye’s, Redway and Hinman’s, and Morton’s, which 
began to show the effect of instruction in physical geog- 
raphy and geology in the high schools, normal schools, 
and colleges. Maury, Hinman, Redway, Davis, Shaler, 
and others had been teaching the teachers of elementary 
and high schools the modern, dynamic, and evolutionary 
physiography which had made great strides during 
the two previous decades. Physical geography had also 
been introduced into the normal schools. Therefore the 
time was ripe for the new books above mentioned. Their 
chief merit is in the adaptation of physical geography 
to the elementary school, and in a better application of 
the causal relation principle. Topographic forms and 
the forces that made them, the waters of the earth, 
meteorology, and the adaptation of animal and vegetable 
life to the physical environment are the chief points in 
which advance is shown. The commercial phase con- 
tinues to show progress.

338 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
Woodcuts give way to photographic processes, in- 
creasing the veracity of the illustrations. The maps 
are more perfect. A new kind of map now added is the 
photo-relief map. 
But in the descriptive or political part these books 
are not much better than their predecessors, consisting 
of the usual laconic, statistical, enumerative paragraphs 
in the usual unconnected order. That which should be 
the most fascinating part of geography is dull and 
uninteresting. The lack in this respect was partially 
made up by supplementary readers, some excellent ones 
now appearing, as the famous F. G. Carpenter’s Series, 
and the Readers by King. 
The recent geography returns to the human side. — 
Since 1900 the other element in geography is again 
emphasized as it should be. The human side had been 
neglected in the enthusiasm for the new physical geog- 
raphy, but was now again recognized. In the text- 
books of King, Dodge, and of Tarr and McMurry we find 
this juster balance between man and nature, and, what 
is more important, the interrelation is worked out much 
better. The interests of the child are again considered. 
The human element in geography will always hold the 
first place in the interests of children. We find therefore 
in the primary geographies of the present day a greater 
emphasis on human life and human occupations, and 
through them an approach to the physical environment.

340 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
In the advanced geographies the causal order is used 
more directly, and still the industrial and social life of 
man is made prominent, as it should be. 
Another excellent feature of these recent books is the 
application of such pedagogical principles as correlation 
with science and history; the method of comparative 
review; and the use of topical or type study, permitting 
a more connected and unified presentation. 
Supplementary literature. — There are now a great 
many excellent supplementary readers, — some of them 
little monographs, from the child’s standpoint, of various 
countries; general descriptive readers; readers of scenic 
description; information readers on the industries; 
nature readers; and readers in physical geography. 
They all help to enrich the subject, to weave it together, 
or to bring out its esthetic aspect. 
Beauty of present texts. — Modern books possess, in 
addition, the advantage of the improvements possible 
by the high perfection of present-day typography, 
photography, including the color-processes, and car- 
tography, which gives them an artistic finish never 
reamed of by the Father of American Geography. 
As textbooks, both from the pedagogical standpoint, 
and that of the art of book-making, the American text- 
book in geography stands at the head.

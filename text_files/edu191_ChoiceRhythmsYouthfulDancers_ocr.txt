  INTRODUCTION 
In the following pages will be found a collection of the rhythms of walking, 
running, skipping, leaping and whirling. The aim has been to portray a progres- 
sive development from these to the more organized marches, rounds, schottisches, 
polkas, galops and waltzes, which naturally follow the more primitive expressions 
of youthful activity. 
The book is designed to meet several urgent educational needs. It logically 
follows our earlier work, “‘ The Rhythms of Childhood,” with the succeeding forms 
that appear in the development of child life, and that-accord with the individual’s 
progress in the acquirement of capacity to organize dramatic form and expression. 
It may also be regarded as preceding the educational material available for teaching 
the dance as an art in high sclfools and colleges. It is consequently adapted for 
general school use, with marches, processionals, recessionals and dance forms suit- 
able for assembly and festival occasions; for the rhythms taught in the schools 
should, of course, function in the varied activities of the daily program. 
Such gymnastic exercise as may be accompanied with music needs the buoyant, 
joyous melody, with the simple but virile rhythms of which folk-melodies are com- 
posed. Indeed, it is possible to make the daily hygienic exercise co-ordinate with 
the finest teaching of rhythmical development through rightly chosen music. All 
forms of exercise may be taken to varying rhythms, whether of arms, legs or torso; 
for by such means is cultivated a more highly developed sense of rhythmical feeling, 
to say nothing of the increase of interest for the child. 
The volume contains the materials from which a variety of dances may be devel- 
oped by pupils under the sympathetic guidance of the teacher’s suggestions. 
Creative development of the feelings is based upon playful activity, through which 
the child artist is permitted and induced to express his thoughts and emotions in 
what is to him a real and consequently a true art form. Therefore, it is to the 
activities of child life that we are looking for such materials as can form the web 
and woof of artistic construction in the dance. And the school offers many oppor- 
tunities that will be utilized by the young artist with a little assistance from the 
teacher in presenting the stimuli, which are drawn from two sources. 
These are, of course, sources of experience: (1) The ordinary daily activity of 
the child, as in athletic games and sports, and (2) such mental imagery (obtained 
through books and other intellectual channels) as he may be able to assimilate 
and develop into original forms of expression. 
The folk-dance is essentially historical. It has performed an important ser- 
vice in revealing the evolutionary path of the dance-drama. Children of to-day, 
however, are constantly creating, in their free activities, dances of the finest feeling 
and artistry constructed from their own thoughts and emotions.

  10 INTRODUCTION 
Hence, remembering the child whose need is for the opportunity to develop 
the rhythmic sense, clothed with personal experience in the expression of different 
emotions through the ever-changing activities of youth, we have confined our 
selections to music that is simple yet evenly measured, and with cadences as strongly 
marked as the average child instinctively portrays them in feeling and movement. 
Several thousand folk-melodies have been examined, in order to obtain a group 
ideally suited to the practical aim we had in view and at the same time possessing 
a definite artistic value. 
For the enjoyment and instruction of children in their homes, accurate “ rec- 
ords” of these rhythms and dances, furnished by one or more of the popular 
methods of mechanical reproduction, would be of undoubted aid in their utiliza- 
tion. The selections recorded upon either disk or music-roll should be of such 
artistic merit as to be not only highly entertaining but thoroughly educational in 
their import. 
   
-P-A-G-E-11
  HOW DANCES ORIGINATE 
Dancing, like its sister arts of music and poetry, may develop toward either 
dramatic or lyric forms. In other words, a more or less definitely told plot will be 
woven into the expression, or the dance will emphasize only the emotions of the 
actor that are translated into movement. 
But invariably the psychological starting-point is found in the lyric basis. 
There is a charging with such intense feeling that the rhythmic mood and pattern 
are spontaneously stamped upon the action. It is because the feet are the base 
and the rhythm markers of the vibrating body that the classifications of walking, 
sliding, running, skipping, leaping and whirling have been used to designate these 
earliest rhythmic forms that children create. Virtually all children enjoy the 
emotional expression of these fundamental moods and movements. 
The images expressed through actions, usually accompanied with tones, reflect 
only the underlying moods created in the child mind by the plot or story. The 
earlier forms of the dance, whether evolved by the folk or by children, are all of 
this type; for both classes literally dance their joys and their sorrows, and the speed, 
accent and forms of the steps are expressions of the emotions portrayed. Poetic 
“feet ” have their origin in this primitive art. 
There is imperative need to be on guard in our teaching of this youthful art in 
education, in order that we may avoid the association of these fundamental rhyth- 
mic states with so-called “‘ steps.” For the whole body of the child vibrates under 
the spell of emotion. It may be joy that comes as a climax of something achieved, 
as shown by a vigorous skip; or it may be gladness tinged with other feelings that 
emphasize the ego to such an extent that variations of the skipping, such as leaping 
or stamping, will be the pattern by which the feet mark the form. 
In the historic dance-forms there has been recorded only the “ step ” as set by 
the pattern of the music. In order to realize the complete artistic form, we must 
revive the image of the vibrating body that is moving under the magic spell of a 
creative instinct, and in imagination see it rise and fall, sway and turn, with pos- 
tures and gestures that are literally thoughts and feelings transforming the physical 
instrument. 
Teaching walks, skips, leaps, etc., as mere steps to be accomplished is much like 
limiting a music pupil to a clavier and expect to develop by this means a skilled 
pianist. What we call march, polka, schottische and waltz movements in music 
are not to be interpreted as steps of a dance; rather must we envisage the palpi- 
tating individual as portraying through lyrical measure the emotions of his soul. 
In the quivering body of a dancing child, vividly animated from head to toe 
by the intensity of his thoughts and emotions, we recognize the original sources of many of our modern dances, and consequently of our musical forms. Children 
do not, of course, often spontaneously execute a patterned dance in a completed 
form; but sketches of many beautiful dance-ballads are made for us in the play- 
hours, and with slight assistance from the skilful teacher the little ones may be 
enabled to create many artistic forms.

PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE DANCE 
PsycHo.ocica.y, the child enters the realm of artistic values in the period of 
development in which the “ ideally significant ’’ rather than the “ physically pres- 
ent” is the prominent characteristic of his activities. From this beginning, let 
us trace the child’s growth in artistic expression for a certain period of his life. 
As “ art is not matter, but thought and emotion,” the child must utilize for his 
purpose the media that are most closely allied with his ideas and feelings. These, 
naturally, are his own actions; hence posture, gesture, pantomime and dance 
movements not only express the child’s feelings but reveal to him the inner reality or 
actual character of life. 
The significant beginnings in the characterization of these emotional states are 
invariably associated with the particular incidents and oft-repeated experiences 
that produce definite and intense states of feeling. The power to pass from an 
individualized expression to a general one comes only after the child has formed his 
patterns through repetitions of similar experiences. These rhythmic movements, 
instinctively manifested, at first reveal only the varying degrees of joyful or sorrow- 
ful emotional states. “When such rhythms are constantly taught in association 
with experiences that demand such an outlet for a child’s emotions, he establishes 
patterns in relation to the kind of impulse that is portrayed, and thereby gains the 
power to use the proper symbols, in order that he may recall the feeling that he 
wishes to express. It was from this understanding of music and the dance that the 
Greeks wrote their melodies in different modes, according to the sentiment they 
desired to portray. 
These essential rhythms of walking, running, skipping, leaping and whirling 
are a habitual mode of expression among primitive peoples as well as with the 
young of civilized races, and the classification of movement presented herein sug- 
gests the kind and degree of emotion expressed. (Sliding or gliding is difficult for 
children to accomplish emotionally as well as physically. Its instinctive practice 
begins during adolescent life, with certain emotional states belonging to that 
period.) The American Indians walk some of their ritual dances with movements 
toward and away from their sacred objects, and the Greek chorus was danced with 
movements toward, around and away from the altar. The processionals and 
recessionals of our own religious, civic and social life are similar types of these ele- 
mental art forms. 
Whether walking, running or any other rhythmic form is the pattern set by 
the feet depends upon the character of the emotional reaction. The quality and 
speed of the movement reveal its intensity as well as its form. The more ego- 
tistically emphatic the sentiment the more the feet stamp the dance. Sympathetic 
or social states will call for more pantomimic action, and the feet carry merely the 
13

  14 PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE DANCE 
rhythmic swing of the story. From the marches of gay and joyous feeling the 
transition to a gladness that runs away with itself is very quickly made. A sudden 
rush of gaiety (or some experience lived through in joyous remembrance) will 
send a child leaping over the ground. The high leaps in men’s dances like the 
“fling ” are a portrayal of the joy and glory of victory as the heroes celebrate their 
exploits. The climax in depth and earnestness of bodily reaction to violent emo- 
tion is evidenced in whirling, as exhibited by a child when he obtains his first view 
of a well-laden Christmas tree. It reaches religious ecstasy in the dance of the 
whirling dervish and a fevered madness in the wild tarantella. 
Our traditional marches, schottisches, polkas, waltzes, etc., are, from the psycho- 
logical viewpoint, merely more firmly established forms of these natural and uni- 
versal rhythmic modes, and occupy a middle ground between the child’s simple 
expression and the developed art of the music-drama. These dance-forms, used 
with a liberal latitude of construction, leading toward the higher art that is appear- 
ing in our college curricula, can render a genuine service in education. Such 
dances do not develop beyond the lyric forms until the impersonation of character 
that is associated with a wider range of mental imagery becomes pronounced. 
Then one or more actors take the very obvious principal parts and play with a 
chorus, as in many of the old ballad-dances, like the Siegfried saga. Many times 
the choral repetition of the accelerating emotions reaches the climax with tre- 
mendous force and emphasis. When the climax is building, by the portrayal of 
contrasting emotions, the chorus usually divides, one side playing against the other. 
The antiphonal chants had their origin in this primitive choral dance, and the 
majority of country (counter) dances are lingering forms of earlier group dramas. 
Thus, in the evolving composition of the dramatic forms, we find an amplifica- 
tion of the circling chorus to a circle with one or more actors delineating the princi- 
pal parts by pantomime, while the chorus embodies the basic emotional moods 
that weave together the various incidents in the plot. The development of two 
intense states of feeling, one sentiment differing from the other, will divide the 
chorus, and one side will dance in opposition to the other. 
The importance of the thought to be expressed, however, when this degree of 
vivid portrayal is reached, soon demands that the voice carry the prominent parts 
in the dance-drama, and the most significant features of the story are chanted or 
recited, either by the counteracting groups or by the actors most gifted in such 
expression, who, from this point, chant or mimic the incidents while the chorus 
reveals the essential character of the emotions developed in the plot. 
Beyond this period in the evolution of the dance-drama, the material herein 
presented does not aim to portray the psychological development of the theme.

MUSIC AND THE DANCE RHYTHM 
Tue triple qualities by which the value of every artistic product is revealed— 
form, character and idea—are closely associated in the origins of both music and 
the dance. They are manifested in all forms of artistic creation through the com- 
bined agencies of harmony, expression and imagination. 
To a certain degree, however, these essential factors display their most intimate 
association in music and dancing; but, as the dance requires so comprehensive a 
use of the body for its expression, there inevitably comes a time when the imagina- 
tion demands an increasing range and complexity of mental and physical co-ordi- 
nation in order thatthe ideality of the expression may be adequately revealed. 
The finer muscles become transformers, as it were, as music evolves, and the qual- 
ities that in its earlier forms may be bodied forth through the dance appear as 
latent forces in both instrument and voice. Shades and tones of meaning develop 
that are too fine for posture or pantomime to convey without the nuances that taut 
vocal cords or delicate finger muscles can alone produce. 
But potentially the dance remains, for the expressive tone and rhythmic move- 
ment of either vocal or instrumental music are transferred from the vibrating body 
that is keyed to the emotional state of its possessor. Educationally, the dance 
calls for a considerable artistic knowledge of the interrelation between these two 
subjects, with their similarities and differences of expression. 
The fundamental rhythmic movements of the body, through which the char- 
acter of the varied emotions of life is expressed, are likewise the basic source of 
creative development in both music and dancing. The modern performance of 
“jazz”? is a reversion to a primitive stage in the evolution of these arts. 
As a means of stimulating further study of their interdependence, the following 
excerpts from “‘ The Beautiful in Music,” by Ernst Pauer, are of suggestive interest 
and fully confirmatory of the principles described in this volume: 
The characteristic feature [of the musical art] may be defined as that which marks or 
expresses the distinctive qualities of a person or of a thing. The law of characteristic 
beauty is expression and feeling. . . . The characteristic shows itself by means of the tones 
and intervals, and finds expression through the minor and major keys, through the time 
and movement, through the accent, the rest, the figures, and passages, and last, but not 
least, through the melody. . . . 
The key is in music what color is in painting. The key furnishes the tone to the 
piece. . . . The different character of the various keys was already recognized by Plato 
and Aristotle, who both speak of keys which act in an enervating way, and of others which 
exert an awakening and invigorating influence on the human mind. We may take it for 
granted that every key has, to a certain extent, its particular domain, in which it reigns 
with a decided supremacy, and in which it satisfactorily expresses its individual char-

  16 MUSIC AND THE DANCE RHYTHM 
The rhythmical movement of music has to be considered as an expression of our inner 
life. Thus, as movement is always associated with physical life, certain phases of the life 
of the soul, of our inner consciousness, may be illustrated or described by music. It is 
natural and evident that such illustrations are represented by different kinds of rhythmicat 
expression. The hearer feels sympathetically all that gives a characteristic importance 
and expression to the rhythm. We call the rhythm characteristic when it expresses in a 
correct and truthful manner the particular or especial feeling. . . . The rhythmical move- 
ment exhibits itself in the emphasis, in the measure or bar, and in the time or movement. 
Generally speaking, the even measures, two-eight, two-four, and common time, appear 
more concentrated and precise than the uneven time of three-eight, and three-four, which 
express a vague and less intense feeling. . . . 
The respective movements of time may be classified under five heads: first, the very 
slow movements; second, the moderately slow movements; third, the moderately quick 
movements; fourth, the quick movements; and fifth, the very quick movements. .. . 
The accent gives to music the characteristic design, invests it with importance, and becomes 
ultimately an individual language of the soul. . . . The accent is in music what a ray 
of light is in painting. It gives life to the whole. But besides giving clearness, the accent 
may impart.a certain liveliness, charm, interest, and originality. . . . 
The pause is not merely a necessity, but may be made the vehicle of the greatest effect. 
. . . In the melody, characteristic beauty shows itself most prominently; and this beauty 
does not consist only in the greater or smaller distance between the different notes, but 
also in the combination of the tones into figures, which fill the rhythmical space com- 
monly called the bar. It is the expression, the intellectual life of the principal theme, 
which gives the characteristic color to the piece. . . . 
If we divided the domain of our feelings as it were into provinces, we should find a 
region of hidden or suppressed activity, grief, and passion; again, a free and elevated life, 
bursting forth in joy and cheerfulness. Our soul may be alternately swayed by feelings 
of seriousness and mirth, solemnity and cheerfulness, dignity and carelessness, reality 
and dreams; and for each of these phases of feeling music possesses an adequate expres- 
SlOM sac Is ls 
We thus find that music speaks its own language in the characteristic element; a Jan- 
guage not indeed so distinct and precise as human speech, but one that, on the other hand, 
soars to heights which human language can hardly attain. . . . Every feeling and every 
emotion that reigns within the vast regions of our inner spirit-world proves its existence 
through the characteristic, which again uses for its representation expression, with all the 
various means we have named. 
Only by becoming conversant with the expressional character of music, as the 
above extracts clearly indicate, can the teacher successfully direct the child mind 
along the path of creative activity in the dance. ‘The correlation begun in the sim- 
ple manner outlined in these chapters, and embodied in the rhythms (with their 
accompanying comments and suggestions) that follow, has unlimited possibilities 
of further development.

SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHERS 
Wuen the dance was first introduced in education from the historic aspect, 
the subject in its psychological and artistic relations was virtually unknown. 
This was due to its suppression, as both a recreation and an art, for so long a period. 
It has been necessary, therefore, to rediscover educationally the evolution of the 
dance and to re-establish its psychological as well as its physical values. As 
scholastic material, however, it received a universal recognition that hastened its 
adoption in the school curricula. Like other subjects, the presentation of the 
dance has followed a distinct path of psychological development. 
Until a degree of familiarity through extensive research into its historic forms 
and significance had been attained, together with a proficiency in the practical 
knowledge of its method of expression and technique, it has been necessary to 
present the instruction in printed form—in “ primers” that furnish the various 
steps, measure by measure, of the individual dances. But a degree of proficiency 
has been reached in which it is essential, if the creative artistry of the pupil is to be 
promoted, that freedom of interpretation in expression and technique should be 
emphasized. It should be no more necessary to describe dance movements with 
the notes and bars of music than to place diacritical marks over words in order that 
they may be pronounced correctly. 
‘ During the last two decades there has been “ charted and graphed ” a mass of 
new material for educational use in the dance. It seems that the time has come to 
select and reorganize whatever is best adapted for use in the schools; and, in the 
effort to do this wisely, it is necessary to remember that in teaching the arts to even 
the youngest students the chief endeavor should be to offer the opportunity for 
creative work. 
The teacher of the dance has to-day the possibility of uniting this subject with 
the other arts in the unfoldment of the aesthetic capacities of the individual. 
The music employed to accompany children’s dances should be somewhat 
different from that used for adults. One needs only to observe a child in free and 
untrammeled action to note that the structure of the body exhibits a different 
rhythmic character, and to discern that the changes of feeling as well as of move- 
ment are usually marked, abrupt and rapid. Much music that the folk have 
created conforms ideally, in these respects, to the necessities of childish thought, 
emotion and activity. 
There is thus afforded great opportunity for the creative teacher to direct the 
orderly development of the child’s rhythmic sense. Practice of the various expres- 
sions of the different rhythms is a most fascinating exercise. The ability to change 
both mental and physical rhythms at will is an essential quality of artistic dancing. 
With these rhythmic emotional patterns children find great joy in combining the 
7
-P-A-G-E-18

on SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHERS 
pantomimic expression of their various activities, such as ball-playing and kite- 
flying, into more and more complex designs. 
In addition to the patterned step, there will be developed such posture and 
gesture as will reveal a more complete plot of the ball-play or other sport. From 
this beginning a well-planned dance will often spread by suggestion and imitation 
throughout the group. The desire to experiment will bring out novel forms. 
The discerning teacher watches for two lines of thought and feeling that are 
inevitably revealed when the creative instinct of a group is called into play to any 
considerable degree. First, there will appear the desire to combine new forms 
(steps) with posture and pantomime—a trying-out stage to observe how different 
expressions are related as well as to enjoy the added interest that novelty produces. 
This is an intellectual play, and it offers the opportunity to develop technical study 
commensurate with the ability of the group. It usually comes first because the 
quick-thoughted ones are always more ready to express their ideas than are those 
possessed of deep feeling. In fact feeling will often retard the child’s expression 
and make his effort appear self-conscious if not awkward. Therefore, for the second 
manifestation, the watchful teacher will be ready to encourage the potential artist 
who is feeling his way through a newly experienced idea. 
Such expression generally comes slowly. It is necessary, first, that the child 
be surcharged with emotion, or the response obtained will be shallow and vapid, 
and ease of movement will pass for attainment. “Those who are concerned for 
art humbly watch for the manifestations of her spirit and do not try to force their 
own method of expression.” * 
It may be suggestive to give here a couple of illustrations of the natural or 
instinctive tendency of children to reproduce through pantomimic dancing many 
of their daily experiences. 
Watching a girl build a beautiful dance while she was apparently playing ball 
with a friend was a most revealing experience. The child threw the ball toward her 
playmate, and then, out of the sheer joy of her action, danced a leaping polka, 
circling about and throwing imaginary balls while waiting for the one actually 
thrown to be returned to her. She leaped to catch the ball upon its return, and 
waltzed about, tossing it as she whirled; then she indulged in a series of leaps and 
runs, just to express the depth of her feeling in the wonder of her new experience. 
Again she caught the ball on the fly, and no whirling dervish ever displayed a 
deeper emotion nor expressed it more truly than the small dancer to whom a new 
height and depth of revelation and inspiration had come. Here was the nucleus 
of a dance as lovely as any Greek maiden ever wrought out of the fabric of past 
deeds of glory, and one embedded in the emotional and kinesthetic life of multitudes 
of children. Such impromptu dances are fit for formulation, and the teacher needs 
only to furnish the setting for the young artist to build some harmonious and 
meaningful dance with both design and color. No two children or groups ever 
build identical forms. 
Another girl, who spontaneously danced a story of kite-flying, created an 
exquisite thing that lacked only a camera to preserve its classic form. Her friends 
were flying their new-made kites on a warm day in the spring, and she, without any, 
portrayed the experience with great vividness. Running, she flew her imaginary 
kite, with every posture of the body and every gesture revealing her story; then,

  SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHERS 19 
as her vision sailed higher and higher toward the blue, she reveled in a dance that 
if put into steps might have been called a leaping polka. But in each swing and 
turn of her body was accented the wondrous story of her flying “ kite,” and the 
joy and gladness, even madness, of the play. Suddenly the imaginary string 
broke (it had been quite forgotten till that instant), and the dance was ended as 
she watched the mental image sail upward beyond the range of vision. 
Many experiences of children, if they are intense and profound, furnish both 
the ideas and the emotional basis for such creative activity as that shown above. 
Then, too, the realm of their imaginary life provides the stimulus for constructing 
dance-dramas of great variety and beauty. Some of the plots will be sufficiently 
extensive to require that several of the rhythms be used to complete them. Thus 
are formed the dance-suite and the ballad-dance. 
Once the creative instinct of children is allowed freedom of expression in the 
manner herein outlined, the possibility of development through co-ordination of 
the several dramatic arts becomes obvious and is seen to be unlimited.

Suggestion.__ If the uplift in thought toward the ideal is sufficiently 
emphasized when some patriotic incident prompts the use of this march, 
there will be an immediate response in posture, step and carriage of the 
body. With the untrained it is often necessary to develop this correla - 
tion.

  2. The Patriots 
Response to a common thought that commands all to join the “for- 
ward” movement is the impelling motive in this and similar marches. 
It is magnetic and forceful. 
Suggestion.__ This kind of movement is not only a fine expres- 
sion of a unified group, but it also offers a medium for the develop- 
ment of harmonious feeling. So marked is its suggestive force that 
its over-exercise tends to develop, figuratively as well as physically, 
the “goose-step”

3. Fife and Drum Parade 
“The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-plercing fife’? — Othello. 
Buoyant, vigorous and eager is the spirit of this march. Children 
instinctively follow its call, for their feelings are naturally akin there- 
to. 
Suggestion.__ The emotional reaction developed by this mode leads 
very quickly into a much more excited state with hastened activity. It 
represents a “gathering of the clan” and encourages further response.

Here is reflected the spirit that ennobled the heroes of old when they

courageous characters in their idealizations of themselves. 
Suggestion.__ This march becomes a spontaneous expression when 
correlated with studies of heroic tales.

5. The Swinging Step 
When children are“in high feather) ready to laugh from buoyancy of 
spirit, they will readily march with a swinging step. The sheer joy of 
life chases their feet along, and the youthful faces are aglow with laugh. 
ter. 
Suggestion.__ This is the type of march movement that children use 
most frequently. They laugh and swing the arms of their swaying bod- 
ies as they walk.

Children enjoy the whimsical feeling of this march, with its oppor- 
tunity for grotesque and fantastic postures. It presents a chance to im- 
personate character that is frolicsome and full of glee. 
Suggestion._._The march offers a fine incentive to practise rapid 
changes of mood, and suggests the procedure for the entrances and ex- 
its in many fairy plays.

  7. A Christmas Processional 
We are exalted and uplifted by the thoughts of Christmastide,and our 
hearts swell with praises that rise to our lips as we approach the sym. 
bol of the Tree of Life. Such a processional is often chanted, for it is 
expressive of a sincere devotion and supplication that seem to impel the 
song. 
Suggestion.__The feet are subordinated in this rhythm. The love and 
devotion are manifested through the face, posture and bodily movement.

8. Festival Dance 
This joyous but gracious dance is appropriate for many festival days. 
We see a group of running children carrying flowers or garlands, or a 
dancing throng that circles round, pausing now and then to offer a mo- 
mentary salutation. 
Suggestion.__ The story of “The Sleeping Beauty” is appropriately 
ended with such a dance. Let the children create the form of its expres- 
sion through their interpretation of the climax of the plot. Ina proces- 
sional intended to mark a seasonal celebration a beautiful dance form, 
with the pattern of “run, run, run, point” or “run, run, run, pause)’ can be 
developed from this allemande.

  9. An Old-Time Dance 
The minuet was both a gracious and a stately processional before 
historic kings and queens. As it lingers in the modern Court presenta- 
tions, only a fragment of its early charm is retained. More than any 
other dance, it requires a setting that will emphasize its essential char- 
acter, in order to portray its true feeling and import. 
Suggestion.__ This is one of the dances that call for the mental image- 
ry produced by the study of certain prominent figures in literature and 
history..those that inspire visions of courts and kings and coronets.

10. Closing Recessional 
The feeling with which any gathering of people separate is quite dif- 
ferent from that which accompanies their assembly. An appropriate mu- 
sical expression to represent this change is desirable, especially when the 
occasion has developed an elevation of spirit that is deep and sincere. 
Suggestion._._The movement is not.so precise in character as in a pro- 
cessional, and the reluctance of parting tends to slacken the pace.

11. Parting Regrets 
There is a sense of sorrow associated with parting from those 
with whom we have enjoyed mutually pleasurable experiences. Chil- 
dren are extremely sensitive to this communal feeling, and the esprit de 
corps is often lost with separation. 
Suggestion,__ The slower, more languid steps and sober faces re- 
veal unmistakably the feeling above referred to. Note the time of this 
recessional, which indicates a sorrow that is youthful in character.

12. Au Revoir 
Children are often pensive and wistful when certain beautiful sto- 
ries are ended, or some happy event is over. The hushed and silent at 
titude betrays how deeply the spell was woven, and how keen is the long- 
ing that they may return to fairy-land. 
Suggestion.__ Usually this feeling is expressed in a quiet posture. 
Sometimes the body is relaxed, though the face gleams with ‘hope. 
Scenes in stories that children dramatize often require that music of 
this type should underlie the choral thought.

13. Here We Come 
The youthful dancers run joyfully to meet their companions and 
greet them with accented step and sprightly manner in order to empha- 
size the salutations. When the approach of comrades gives pleasure, 
the retreat will also be marked in character in order to accentuate the 
feeling of loss when separated. 
Suggestion.__ This mode has many applications, and is typical of the 
childish longing to do something in order to express the feeling devel- 
oped by congenial activity.

15. The Joy of Morning 
All children know the feeling “with the lark, when the morning 
dawns” The beauty of life and joy of companionship are the soul of 
this dance. 
Suggestion._._ The movement is with a leaping step, and a dancing 
“round” is formed spontaneously. The children run ina circle and re- 
turn. Then they join their companions in two lines, circling with mutu- 
al greetings as they meet. Children will develop their own dance move- 
ment quickly with this intimation, and no two groups will express it in 
the same manner.

Here is a light-hearted mood that longs to express itself through 
a frolicsome movement. Children run and run, with the merriest 
hearts and the lightest feet. “What fun life is!” they seem to exclaim. 
Suggestion.__ The skilful teacher will give children freedom to use 
this and similar forms as they feel the interpretation.

Cheerfulness and vivacity are expressed in this dancing “round.”

may well represent the happy termination of some activity.

18. The Funny Swagger 
With children the love of exaggeration is most naturally shown by 
a swagger that goes clumsily from side to side. It is a great pleas- 
ure for high-spirited children to express their sense of the ridiculous 
through droll acting. 
Suggestion._-— This small rhythm is often the appropriate outlet 
for a group where the lively spirit developed needs a chance to blus- 
ter a trifle. It may be associated with several folk-tales.

  20. Dance of the Highlands 
The sprightliness and animation of this movement are evidenced by 
its lilt. The leap is very prominent in the rhythm. 
Suggestion.__ The transition in movement from running to leaping 
comes with increased animation. A “run, run, run, leap and point” is oft- 
en the pattern used. It soon develops to the step of “slide, change, leap, 
hop” that characterizes the Highland dances. Different dance forms 
may be suggested to children by this music.

step: right, left,right and left, right, left. It offers many opportunities 
for creative expression.

“The years at the spring, 
And day’s at the morn.’.. Browning. 
In May-time, children go trippingly over the ground. It is scarcely 
fair for grown-ups to expect them to stay down on the earth, for the 
spring’s returning life and vigor tingle in their young blood. 
Suggestion.__ “I feel so dancey” is the manner in which the average 
child describes this mood. Ht is a favorite expression for exuberant life 
and frolicsome days. The high skip is bounding, though very light.

“T must go seek some dewdrops here, 
And hang a pearl in every cowslips ear.” 
--A Midsummer Nights Dream. 
So close to the heart of youth is the desire to “play a fairy” that 
children crave the opportunity to dance this melody. It seems to af- 
ford a means of entrance to the world of imagination. 
Suggestion.__ The practised teacher will give the setting for crea- 
tive play with such an incentive as this fairy-like music produces.

In the heyday of youth the spirit often rises to such a height 
that children declare they “would like to jump over the moon.” Here 
is an opportunity. 
Suggestion.__ “Leap, run, run.” with change of step as in the polka, 
begins the pattern of this dance. The excitement increases until whirls 
are added to the movement, and the youthful imagination supplies the 
subsequent action.

Gladness that becomes pronounced, even demanding in its empha- 
sis, is marked in this dance. It is often associated with an increased 
desire to be seen and heard, in order to gratify the overcharged ego. 
Suggestion.__The form of the heel-and-toe polka is conspicuous 
in this music. But children will use the melody for other rhythmic 
expressions if given the opportunity, and will often create an origin- 
al group dance.

  26. The Heroes’ Dance 
This mode is energetic and forceful. It is allied to the feeling 
suggested by “flourish of trumpet and beat of drum) but is full of hu- 
mor and good-natured jollity. 
Suggestion,__ This stamping polka step, with its very vigorous move- 
ment, is susceptible to different interpretations. The whole body is en- 
ergized to an extreme degree. The dancers will originate the “figures” 
that fit the occasion.

27. Happy Children 
As stamping the feet and clapping the hands are means of accent 
and emphasis in the dance, so speed of movement is a method of re- 
vealing increased tension. A light-footed and swift “chasing step” 
means quickened thoughtin a child. | 
Suggestion.__ Children gallop with so agile and rapid a movement 
that they leap rather than slide over the ground. As speed and inten- 
sity develop, the leap becomes more prominent in the step.

28. The Merry Ones 
Emotionally, the movements of the galop and the reel are closely 
associated, for the latter is an expression of common occurrence among 
merry and nimble-witted peoples. “Flashes of witare invariably fleet 
of foot. 
Suggestion... This dance will build itself in the thought and action 
of a group when temperament and occasion call it forth. When chil- 
dren want a frolic that expresses whimsical and piquant feeling they 
will quickly develop such a form 4s this, and the step will be danced 
in all directions as the spirit of fun dictates.

29. The Driver 
In the childish imagination, the galloping horse is typical of great 
intensity of thought and heightened speed of action. It is also asso- 
ciated with the rider of the night wind. The music will coincide with 
many moods that are familiar to all children.

31. The Jumping Jack 
Boys, especially, like to dance with grotesque and ludicrous ges- 
tures and postures. To leap and caper with stiffened muscles is to them 
a highly humorous procedure and an expression of great hilarity of spirit. 
Suggestion.__ This dance will follow most appropriately an occu- 
pation that has brought about a rollicking mood, with high animal 
spirits. Let all possible originality of form and figure develop.

32. Youthful Vigor 
Youthful strength and robustness distinguish this music. The “lusty 
gallant” was a name given to similar dances among the folk, and it 
is quite indicative of its character. 
Suggestion..__ The step is frequently a high leap with bent knee 
raised. The dance is identified with athletic sports, and promotes 
skill in performance.

33. Leaps and Turns 
When leaping, stamping and turning are combined in the bodily 
expression of feeling, they indicate a degree of ardor and vivacity 
that suggests an approaching climax in the joy of living. 
Suggestion... Such fiery joyousness will spontaneously form its 
pattern, A little training to free the feet from clumsiness should be 
all that is necessary to start children “a-jigging)’ provided the mood 
suggests the dance. The artful teacher will let a jig “just happen” 
for then the mental and emotional state will furnish a background for 
some practice in technique.

34, All Hands Around 
The waltz movement in rhythmic expression develops through run- 
ning and whirling, or leaping and whirling. The whirl is executed ei- 
ther swiftly or slowly according to the stress of the excitement engen- 
dered, for it is the extreme expression used in the dance to portray feel- 
ings of either fascination or ecstasy. 
Suggestion... Happy children often run and whirl when some plea. 
surable possession has come to them__such as a new mental image that 
produces an enraptured joyousness, or some new toy or occupation that 
brings the pride of ownership and a novel experience. At Christmas 
and other festivals children will dance the rhythm spontaneously, and 
from this propensity the teacher will get hints for its further use.

35. A Spring Dance 
Many children show their delight in the springtime by whirling 
around rather slowly with arms outstretched and face uplifted, as if 
feeling the rapturous dawn of the season of lifes reawakening. Often- 
times they will dance with flowers in their arms, scattering them as 
they whirl. A partner may also be danced about, in order to share 
the transport of delight. 
Suggestion.__ The festival days offer a background for the devel- 
opment of this dance_. also many incidents in the childs experience.

36. Whirling Away 
Excitement produced by pleasurable anticipation finds its most im- 
petuous expression in the “leap and whirl” of children and of the folk. 
When the former are on the tiptoe of expectancy they will frequently 
break into this manner of dance. 
Suggestion.__ Before holidays, or in anticipation of the joys of any 
particularly delightful experience, the rhythm is spontaneously execu- 
ted. From such a starting - point it can be developed with its proper 
emotional background.

37. Dancing Wild 
The mood here represented is an expression of the movements of 
extreme ecstasy. It may typify the fervor of an impassioned longing, 
or the moment of fruition of some rapturous state. 
Suggestion... This whirling movement is the culmination in any 
dance in which it is appropriately introduced. In the conventionalized 
dance it becomes the pirouette.

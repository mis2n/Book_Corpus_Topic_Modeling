PREFACE 
This book had its origin in several years of 
experience and experiment in teaching classes 
in literature in the Laboratory School of the 
University of Chicago, when that fruitful 
venture in education was being conducted by 
Professor John Dewey; in many years of pri- 
vate reading with children; and in many years 
of lecturing to teachers of children. Indeed, all 
the material bears the unconcealable marks of its 
origin as lectures, it being extremely difficult to 
turn into decorous chapters in a book, stuff which 
first took shape as spontaneous and informal 
lectures. 
The central matter of the book was pub- 
lished as a series of articles in the Elementary 
School Teacher of October, November, and De- 
cember, 1902, and a synopsis of the whole book 
was printed and widely circulated in January, 
1904. These facts may partially account for a 
certain familiarity that many readers will per- 
ceive. May I venture to hope that this sense of 
familiarity may also be partly accounted for by 
the fact that the views expressed are conso-

nant with those arrived at independently by many 
recent students of literature and of children? 
Were it not a matter of mere justice, this 
would be scarcely the place to mention my debt 
of many kinds to Professor W. D. MacClintock 
of the University of Chicago; the incalculable 
value of Professor Dewey’s influence and sym- 
pathy; and the unforgettable stimulation of Mrs. 
Dewey’s criticism. Neither is it more than 
justice to express my gratitude for the patience 
of my publishers, which has endured both much 
and long.

CHAPTER I 
LITERATURE IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
According to the naively formal method of 
division of the old-fashioned homiletics, the title 
itself offers a quite inevitable outline for the dis- 
cussion in this chapter—an outline that takes this 
form: (1) literature; (2) literature in the 
school; (3) literature in the elementary school; 
and while we may smile at the pat formality of 
the little syllabus, we cannot resist its logic. Per- 
haps we can retain the logic while we disguise 
the formality. 
When one proposes to enter for any purpose 
or from any point of view, a large field, especially 
a field that has already been much explored, he 
feels that he must hasten to define his bounds, 
to stake out his particular claim. But he makes 
a mistake if, in his haste to do this, he fails to 
make clear his understanding of the location of 
the large field and his conception of its nature. 
Any new discussion of literature must justify 
itself at the beginning by declaring from what 
point of view it will proceed and in what 
direction it will move. This seems a good place, 
then, to declare that this whole discussion will 
r 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
  2 Literature in the Elementary School 
concern itself with literature as a part of the train- 
ing of children. Yet this discussion must con- 
stantly proceed in the light of certain funda- 
mental conclusions concerning literature in gen- 
eral, and in its essential nature, and it will help 
us to stand upon common ground to state these 
conclusions. 
Literature, like every other subject that would 
claim a place as a discipline in school, is called 
upon in our day of re-examination and re- 
adjustment of the curriculum to make good its 
claim by showing that it has in its nature some- 
@ thing distinctive by virtue of which it performs 
in the child’s education some distinctive ser- 
vice. It is true, that no subject of human 
interest is a quite detached island; pursued far 
enough, its edges blur and mingle with the edges 
of neighboring interests, so that there are regions 
where the two are indistinguishable. But every 
body of material has a characteristic center where 
it declares itself unmistakably. However widely 
it radiates from this center, however many or 
however distant areas it touches and mingles 
with upon its borders, in this center it is itself 
and nothing else. This becomes clear when we 
consider some of the larger subjects of educa- 
tional discipline. There is, for example, a well- 
defined subject, geography, though if one pur- 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
  Literature in the Elementary School 3 
sues it far, he comes in one direction upon geol- 
ogy; in other directions, upon history or eco- 
nomics or sociology or politics. Or to take another 
group of subjects, there is a region in which you 
are dealing with anatomy, though on the edges 
of it you pass imperceptibly into physiology or 
general biology. 
For several reasons it is especially difficult to 
fix the bounds of literature. It touches the mar- 
gins of every other human interest; it may reach 
into any of the areas about it for subject-matter ; 
it shares with all other subjects its means of 
expression; it lends to all other subjects certain ° 
of its methods and devices, when these other 
subjects must be presented effectively; its very 
name is applied loosely and ‘half figuratively to 
writing upon any subject, and for whatever pur- 
pose produced. But for all this, literature, too, 
has its distinctive center, where it can be differ- 
entiated from everything else. 
We begin to make this differentiation when we 
say that literature is art—that it is one of the fine 
arts. We set it apart from the other arts by the 
fact that it uses language as its medium, and we 
set it apart from other writing by the fact that it 
uses language in the way art must use it—not 
for technical purposes, not as a medium for teach- 
ing facts or doctrines, not to give information,
-P-A-G-E-12
  
  4 Literature in the Elementary School 
but to produce artistic pleasure; not to conserve 
use, but to exhibit aesthetic beauty. 
When one’s mind is clear on this point, he 
will not be confused by the fact that literature 
handles matter from other provinces—history 
for example—or by the fact that other kinds of 
writing borrow the devices of literature to 
beautify or otherwise make effective their own 
material. When Scott takes from history 
the figure of Richard Coeur de Lion, it is not for 
the purpose of teaching historical fact, but for 
the sake of putting into his picture a striking 
person and an effective motive. When Macaulay 
employs many figures of speech, when he rounds 
out his periods and balances them carefully, when 
he uses picturesque concrete and particular per- 
sons and objects rather than abstractions and 
generalizations, all to make clear and vivid the 
information he is giving, he is still writing his- 
tory and not literature, since he is aiming first 
at fact and not first at beauty. 
This recognition of literature as art, and the 
differentiation of it from the other kinds of 
writing, so far from being a mere bit of aesthetic 
theory remote from the teacher and his child, is 
the fundamental and essential step in the teacher’s 
procedure, because it constitutes at once a clue 
to lead him in his choice of material, a guide to 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  
Literature in the Elementary School 5 
direct him in the method of using it, and a stand- 
ard to indicate the nature of the result he may 
reasonably hope for. When the teacher knows 
that he is to choose his literature as art he is freed 
from the obligation of selecting such things as 
will contain technical information, historical 
facts, desirable moral lessons, or other utilitarian 
matter. This is far from saying that in choosing 
he will be indifferent to the actual material details 
or to the moral atmosphere of his bit of literature. 
The fitness or unfitness, the beauty or ugli- 
ness of these will often be the ground of his 
adoption or rejection. It does mean, however, 
that technical and professional details of fact and 
teaching, matters which are always subsidiary 
and secondary in literature as literature, cannot 
dictate his choice when he is choosing from the 
point of view of art. 
The habit of regarding literature as art clari- 
fies immediately the teacher’s conception of his 
method of handling it. To teach literature as 
literature is not to teach it as an adjunct to some 
other discipline; it is not to teach it as reading- 
lessons, or spelling-lessons, nor as grammar— 
though incidentally the lessons in literature will 
have great value in all these directions; it is not 
to teach it as botany, as history, as mythology, 
as politics, as naval or military tactics, or as
-P-A-G-E-14
  
6 Literature in the Elementary School 
ethics—though again, by way of teaching it as 
literature, interesting by-products in any of these 
subjects may accrue. 
It is equally true that a clear understanding 
of the fact that the results aimed at and legiti- 
mately hoped for are to be of the literary, artistic 
kind, and not of the utilitarian or scientific kind, 
will lighten and irradiate the teacher’s problem 
and through him the children’s task, doing away 
with the sense of burden and substituting for a 
vague and shifting end, a definite and delightful 
purpose. 
To take a specific instance—it is very little to 
the purpose of literature to have taught a 
class that Longfellow was an American poet 
who lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts; and 
that, though the myth and legend of Hiawatha 
properly belong to the Iroquois, Longfellow 
transferred it to the Objibways. So far as 
the distinctively literary result goes, these facts 
are neither here nor there. But the enjoy- 
ment of the music of the verse, the loving appro- 
priation and appreciation of some of the beautiful 
images and pictures, some grasp of the large 
meaning, the noble trend, of the whole poem, a 
general tuning-up of the class to something like 
unison with its emotion, a better taste in the whole 
class, and in a few members of it some improve-
-P-A-G-E-15
Literature in the Elementary School 7 
ment in their own powers of expression—these 
are the kind of result at which the teacher aims 
when he teaches literature as art. 
The question of literature in the school has 
taken on a new aspect in this our current day, 
and especially in American schools, owing to the 
decidedly diminished place left for it in the 
modern curriculum. This has come about most 
naturally in the vast enrichment of the course 
on the side of scientific and occupational material. 
And naturally, too, in the process of turning from 
a purely book-education, we have tended to turn 
also from literature—a field which for many 
generations has seemed to be inextricably shut up 
in books. But it is also true that, in a large part, 
this turning-away from literature has been from 
literature wrongly apprehended and mistakenly 
taught. Whatever be the explanation of the 
smaller place given to literature, no thoughtful 
student of modern education, no matter how 
firmly he believes in the function of literature, 
can regret that it should take in the curriculum 
its due and proportionate place. Such a student 
knows best the follies and absurdities achieved 
by untrained and inartistic teachers, in whose 
hands literature is made the center to which they 
attach any and all other matters of training; 
he best knows the fact that literature leaves
-P-A-G-E-16
8 Literature in the Elementary School 
many of the child’s powers and capacities un- 
touched; he best knows the danger of over- 
stimulating those powers and capacities that 
literature does develop and strengthen, and that 
it is a misfortune for a child or a class to live pre- 
vailingly in an atmosphere distinctively literary ; 
and he knows that a few specimens chosen aright 
and taught aright produce the essentially literary 
result more surely and more safely than such a 
programme as could once be seen in school—a 
programme that seemed to reflect the teacher’s 
desire to give the children within the grammar 
school all the reading that they ought reasonably 
to be expected to have up to maturity. 
The choosing of literature for use in school 
creates immediately several important conditions. 
The bit chosen is elevated at once into the dignity 
and isolation of a discipline, and is set apart 
from matter to be read once and casually, 
for recreation or amusement, at home or in 
hours of intellectual play, to the single child 
or a small group of homogeneous children. 
In view of the fact that the specimen is being 
chosen for use in class, it must be broad and 
typical, appealing, as it were, to the universal 
child. It must not be merely fanciful, freakish, 
satirical, or witty, because, while there is pretty 
sure to be some child in every class who would
-P-A-G-E-17
  
Literature in the Elementary School 9 
appreciate its flavor, the others would not, and 
could not be brought to such appreciation. It 
should not be too imaginative, since it must 
make its appeal to a group whose experience has 
been of many kinds and degrees, and it cannot 
count upon any uniform body of apperception 
material that has paved the way into a very deli- 
cate or very pervasive imaginative atmosphere. 
It must not be too emotional, because the teacher 
must be aware of the hysterical children in every 
class, and because it is next to impossible to tune 
up any social group as large and as mixed as 
the class to anything like a high emotional unison 
or complete artistic like-mindedness. What the 
class, that composite child, needs are such things 
as display the broader, simpler aspects of life and 
art, such as call out in them the simpler and more 
direct responses. 
If one is giving a story or a poem a single 
reading, and reading it merely for recreation, 
he may pass so lightly over the details, and may 
so handle its structure, that its weaknesses and 
faults may not appear, or may easily be lost sight 
of in the emphasis laid upon the pleasant and 
successful aspects. But a bit of literature selected 
for the class must be worth while in every par- 
ticular; it is to be lingered over, digested, assimi- 
lated; it must be fitted to stand out in the light
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 —- Literature in the Elementary School 
of searching criticism—and the assembled class 
soon comes to be a very acute and exacting critic; 
it is to stand the test of individual question and 
community judgment. If, therefore, it is to be- 
come, as one must hope, a part of the children’s 
experience, a contribution to their artistic and 
moral well-being; if it is to be a bit of real edu- 
cation, it must be sound in structure, trustworthy 
in detail, satisfactory in issue. No matter how 
simple it is, it should be good art, and chosen 
upon the same critical principles that one would 
apply in choosing good literature of any degree of 
complexity. 
While it is a great mistake to suppose that 
literature for children is a bit of garden ground 
to be considered apart from the general land- 
scape, it is true that there are certain character- 
istics of children within the elementary period, 
and certain accepted conclusions concerning the 
nature and spirit of their other work, that must 
be taken as guides in the matter of their litera- 
ture. It is not sufficient—though it cannot be too 
often said that it is necessary—that the literature 
be good; that, no matter how simple it be or how 
complex, it must satisfy the demands of good 
criticism—however important it be that it be 
good, it is equally important that it be fit. 
One who reads the courses of study and lists
-P-A-G-E-19
  Literature in the Elementary School 11 
of reading prepared for the elementary grades, 
and examines the manuals for their teachers, 
comes near concluding that the larger number of 
mistakes, and the mistakes most disastrous, lie 
here—in losing sight of the principle of fitness. 
For in these formal lists, and suggested in the 
manuals, one may find, first and last, heaped up 
all that various teachers have themselves happened 
to like; all that critics have praised; all whose 
titles sound as if they ought to be good; all that 
is concerned more or less remotely with other 
things the children are studying; all that a gen- 
eration of mistaken educational logic has sug- 
gested; all that a mature reader ought to have 
read in a life-time; all that a blind interpretation, 
both of childhood and of literature, has called 
suitable—historical works, American literature, 
Shakespeare’s comedies, the Idylls of the King, 
sentimental and bloodthirsty juveniles—a chaotic 
and accidental jumble. Out of some such hap- 
hazard impulse and some such failure to apply 
the law of fitness come such mistakes as the intro- 
duction of fifth-grade children into the mazes 
of a satiric social comedy like 4 Midsummer- 
Night’s Dream, or the placing of first-year second- 
ary children amid the bitter jests and baffling 
irony of The Vicar of Wakefield. Such peda- 
gogical misfits arise out of sheer ignorance of
-P-A-G-E-20
  12 Literature in the Elementary School 
the child’s nature and its needs, and of the 
plainest principles of literary interpretation. 
They persist year after year because of the blind 
following of supposed authority, nowhere so 
blind as in matters of literary opinion. 
The preparation that should be made by the 
teacher who is to choose and teach this literature 
is, after all, not so very formidable. We will 
leave out of the discussion that mystic thing 
called the teacher’s gift. Undoubtedly there is 
such a thing; but it descendeth upon whom it 
listeth, enabling him to choose by intuition 
and to teach by inspiration the special bits of 
literature that prove to be best for the children. 
But such a person is not safe, unless he supple- 
ment his gift with knowledge; his choice is purely 
personal and esoteric, his principles accidental 
and incommunicable. 
What is the nature of the supplement such a 
teacher must make to his gift? What is the 
training with which the teacher without the gift 
must fortify himself? It is little more than one 
would like to have for his personal culture, and 
little other than he is obliged to have for his con- 
tact with the children in other directions. By 
dint of much reading of literature and some read- 
ing in good criticism he must bring himself to a 
sane view of the whole subject, realizing what 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
Literature in the Elementary School 13 
literature is and what it is not; what it can be 
expected to accomplish in human culture, and what 
we cannot reasonably ask of it. He must know 
something of its laws, that he may know how to 
judge it and when he has judged it aright. This 
process will inevitably have refined and deepened 
his taste and broadened his artistic experience in 
every direction. Of course, he will not talk to his 
children about literature as an art, about critical 
problems, structural principles, and all that; no 
more will he, when he is guiding his class in 
evolving for themselves food and shelter by way 
of beginning the study of history, talk to them 
about primitive culture and social evolution. But 
he is an ill-equipped and untrustworthy guide if 
he does not have in his own consciousness these 
large explaining points of view. It is precisely 
so with the large fundamental principles of litera- 
ture. One gathers certainty and power for the 
choice and teaching of the merest folk-tale, if he 
is able to see in it the working of the great and 
simple laws of all art. And more specifically he 
must imbue himself with the spirit of the child- 
like literature. He must know and love the 
wonderful old folk and fairy tales, not regarding 
them as matter for the nursery and the kinder- 
garten, merely, but learning to love them as great 
but simple art. He must read the hero tales and
-P-A-G-E-22
  
14 Literature in the Elementary School 
romances till he knows them as a treasure house 
out of which he may draw at his need. Many, 
many children’s stories and poems he must read 
to be able to judge them and he must read all 
those artists, Carroll, Stevenson, Pater, Haupt- 
man, who in Alice, The Child’s Garden, The 
Child in the House, Hannele, have done so much 
to interpret for us in the artist’s way the con- 
sciousness of the child. 
In teaching literature, as in all that he does for 
the children, he will have use for all the knowl- 
edge he can get of childhood and children; for all 
that he can learn of the trend of conclusion in psy- 
chology and educational philosophy ; for all knowl- 
edge he can acquire as to the meaning and import 
of all the other subjects of elementary instruction. 
Only then can he choose and teach literature that 
is fit in both the necessary senses—adapted to the 
children and harmonious in spirit with the other 
interests they are pursuing. Out of such knowl- 
edge of his material and his children there should 
grow a reasonably clear and consistent vision of 
the result he hopes to reach and the steps he must 
take to reach it. Out of all these elements should 
come the courage to examine fearlessly the tra- 
ditional material. Better still, out of this com- 
bination will come that faith, enthusiasm, and 
respect for his material, that confidence in its 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  
Literature in the Elementary School 15 
usefulness, that hopefulness as to its results, 
which are desirable in a teacher of any sub- 
ject, but which are absolutely essential in the 
equipment of a teacher of literature; because he 
must above all things radiate both light and 
warmth; he must diffuse about his material and 
his children the breath of life and the glow of art. 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  CHAPTER II 
THE SERVICES WE MAY EXPECT LITERATURE TO 
RENDER IN THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN 
It would seem to be no part of the present dis- 
cussion to go into the fundamental processes of de- 
termining and defining a child’s needs and tastes. 
In this matter we may assume and build upon 
the larger conclusions of psychology and educa- 
tional philosophy. And it is only the larger and 
more general conclusions that we need, both be- 
cause there is no doubt concerning them, as there 
may be concerning those more detailed and 
remote, and because when we are dealing with 
children in school, and in class, we are dealing 
with the type-child—with a composite child, as it 
were, to whom we can apply only the larger con- 
clusions. 
Everyone who helps to train a child must 
realize as a practical fact that he has both needs 
and tastes. The emphasis wisely placed in our day 
upon enlisting a child’s interests and tastes has 
tended to mislead the unwary and undo the unob- 
servant, so as to produce a blindness or an indif- 
ference as to his needs. Though, as a matter of 
mere justice, one must add that the blindness and 
16
-P-A-G-E-25
  In the Education of Children 14 
indifference have had their existence chiefly in 
the indictments of those who opposed the move- 
ment when it was new. 
Few parents or teachers may now be found so 
benighted as to deny the delight and profit of 
letting the child grow in all the joy and freedom 
possible, following his instinctive interests, ex- 
pressing his original primitive impulses. But we 
must grant, however sadly, that the modern child 
is not to be a member of a primitive society ; that 
he is living and to live in a complex, advanced 
community, to whose standards he must be, on 
the whole, adjusted and adapted. Therefore, his 
interests and activities must be channeled and 
guided; new interests must be awakened; he 
must be in a certain sense put, while he is still a 
child, into possession of what his race has ac- 
quired only after many generations. 
In literature then, as in the other subjects, 
we must try to do three things: (1) allow and 
meet appropriately the child’s native and instinct- 
ive interests and tastes; (2) cultivate and direct 
these; (3) awaken in him new and missing iuter- 
ests and tastes. What is there in literature 
serviceable for any or all of these purposes, and 
is there in literature anything that is distinctively 
and uniquely useful in the whole process? It 
seems only reasonable to look for the answers to
-P-A-G-E-26
  18 Literature in the Elementary School 
these questions among the distinctive features 
of literature. 
The most conspicuous and distinguishing fact 
about literature is, of course, its relation to the 
imagination. Now, when the student of litera- 
ture or any other art talks about the imagination, 
he must be allowed to begin, as one may say, 
where the psychologist leaves off, because, while 
the psychologist as a scientist likes to limit his 
attention to the mind acting as imagination, the 
literary critic must consider, not only this activity 
of the mind, but its product—a product that 
presents itself as an elaborate phenomenon. This 
is the reason why the natural process of the 
literary critic seems to the student of psychology 
a beginning at the wrong end; because it is a be- 
ginning with an objective product, and with the 
larger and more salient features of that product. 
Literature finds its material in nature, and in 
humén_nature_and_life, It has no source of 
supply other than that of every other kind of 
human thought. But before this material be- 
comes literature, the imagination has lifted it 
from its place in the actual world and elevated 
it to the plane of art. Working upon this plane 
with this material, the imagination modifies, 
transforms, rearranges it, making new combina- 
tions, discovering unsuspected relations, bring- 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  In the Education of Children 19 
ing to light hidden qualities, revealing new 
likenesses and unlikenesses; and at last returns 
to us a product that is a new creation. Working 
in its larger creative capacity, the imagination 
constructs out of material which may be scat- 
tered or chaotic when gathered by observation, 
unified and organic wholes. 
Indeed this large whole, this completed edifice 
that the art-product presents is itself an image, a 
vision present from the beginning of the process 
of creating. As the architect sees before he begins 
to build, the plan of his house as a whole and 
measurably complete thing, so the literary artist 
has from the beginning this large image, this 
plan presenting the main features of the thing 
he is to produce. This allows for the fact that 
new details are added as he goes on, the plan 
modified or transformed. But the artist’s final 
result starts as an image. 
This is not mere aesthetic prosing. We must 
set it down as vitally important in the point of 
view of the teacher of literature, that he must 
look at his material as the product of the imagi- 
nation in these four ways: first, the imagination 
presents the large image or plan; second, it 
chooses the material ; third, it decorates, purifies, 
or otherwise modifies it; fourth, it organizes or 
recombines it. This recombination into a new 
 
-P-A-G-E-28

whole, no matter how simple it is, will, if it be art 
at all, display in some degree the large qualities 
common to all art-form—unity, variety, sym- 
metry, proportion, harmony. It is the fact that 
in literature you have a large but manageable 
whole got together under laws producing these 
qualities and making for completeness and beauty 
—it is this fact that gives to literature a large 
share of its power in cultivating the child’s 
imagination. 
Now, there is a very common misapprehension 
of this phrase “cultivation of the imagination,” 
many people taking it for granted that it invari- 
ably and exclusively means increasing the amount 
of a child’s fancy, or the number of his fancies. 
Undoubtedly this is one of the effects of litera- 
ture, and undoubtedly it is sometimes a desirable 
thing. There are children born without imagi- _ 
nation, or so early crushed down by the common- 
_ placeness of the adult world that they seem never 
to have a fancy—to be entirely without an inner 
life or a spiritual playground. But the average 
child has abundant imagination, and an abun- 
dance of imaginations; while children of the 
artistic or emotional temperament may often 
be found, especially in the period gathering 
about the seventh year, living in a world of 
their own creating, moving in a maze of fan-
-P-A-G-E-29
In the Education of Children 21 
tastic notions and combinations of notions, 
unable to see actual things, and unable to report 
the facts of an observation or an experience, 
because of the throng of purely fanciful and 
invented details that fills their consciousness. To 
increase the amount of such a child’s imaginative 
material would be a mistake; to throttle or 
ignore his imaginative activities would be a mis- 
take still more serious. 
We all know the two paths, one of which is 
likely to be followed by such a child. Either he 
drifts on, indulging his dreams, inventing un- 
guided fancies, following new vagaries, and 
later reading those loose, wild, and sentimental 
things into which his own taste guides him, till 
all his mental processes become untrustworthy ; 
or he is taken in hand, given fact-studies exclu- 
sively, becomes ashamed of his fancies, or loses 
interest in them because they bear no relation to 
anything in the actual world as he is learning to 
know it, and finally loses completely his artistic 
imaginative power. 
As an aid toward averting either of these 
disasters, the imaginative child—who is the aver- 
age child—as well as the over-fanciful one, needs 
to have developed in him some ability to select 
among his fancies, so as to cling to the beautiful 
and useful, and discard the idle ones. To do
-P-A-G-E-30
    22 Literature in the Elementary School 
this, he must get the ability to put them together 
in some plan or system that satisfies both his 
taste and his judgment. They are permanently 
serviceable either for work or for play only when 
they attach one to another and cohere into a 
somewhat orderly whole. One is tempted to think 
that to put the children into possession of such 
a faculty or such an accomplishment is the most 
important step in elementary training, because, 
as a matter of course, it at once radiates from 
the handling of their invented or fanciful material 
into the ordering of that which they gather from 
deliberate observation; and, as most often hap- 
pens, the -artistic imagination lends a helping 
hand to the scientific imagination. Undoubtedly 
the pleasantest way and the way that lies most 
readily open in helping the children to acquire 
and develop this faculty, is the way of literature. 
Here it is that they see most easily and learn 
to know most thoroughly those complete and 
orderly wholes made up from beautiful or 
significant details, with nothing left fragmen- 
tary or unattached. Of course the teacher must 
choose his bit of literature with a view to this 
effect—a lyric, a ballad, a story, that actually 
does show economy of material, reasonable and 
effective arrangement of details, and a satis- 
fying issue. Not all the literature available
-P-A-G-E-31
  
In the Education of Children 23 
for children does display these qualities. Com- 
pare, for example, Perrault’s Cinderella with 
Grimm’s version of the same tale. The former, 
whatever the faults of style in the English version 
we all know, is so far as structure goes, a little 
classic, having plenty of fancy, to be sure, but 
exhibiting also perfect economy of incident, cer- 
tainty and delicacy in the selection and arrange- 
ment of details, restraint and truthfulness in the 
outcome; while the Grimm story shows the 
chaotic, unguided, wasteful choice and arrange- 
ment of the mind which remains the victim 
of its own fancies. The one is mere art-stuff, 
the other is art. 
Now, one would hasten to add that there are 
children in every class, and it may be in every 
family—unimaginative, matter-of-fact, common- 
place children—who need to have given them, and 
to learn to enjoy, if possible, the mere vagaries 
and haphazard inventions; and it would be a pity 
to deprive any child of them in his hours of 
intellectual play. But it is from his contact, fre- 
quent and deep, with the more artistic and 
ordered bits of literature that we may expect the 
child to find that special cultivation of the imagi- 
nation, the power of seeing an organized imagi- 
native whole; and out of this experience should 
grow the further power, so important in this
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 = Literature in the Elementary School 
stage of his education—that of grasping, and 
constructing out of his own material, such com- 
plete and ordered wholes. 
Another way in which the imagination works 
in literature is of peculiar importance, for the 
children. This, too, is precisely one of those 
characteristics that distinguish literature from 
everything else. It lies in the fact that, unlike 
other kinds of writing, literature proceeds by the 
presentation of concrete, specific details, the actual 
image, or images, combined into a definite 
picture, elevated from the world of actuality to 
the plane of art, or created on that plane out of 
details gathered from any source. In proportion 
as we find in literature abstract thinking, state- 
ment of general truth or plain fact, facsimile 
description or mere sentimentalizing, in that pro- 
portion do we find it dull and inartistic. ‘The 
orange is a reddish-yellow semi-tropical fruit,” 
is a statement of fact plain and scientific. It 
would be so inartistic as to be absurd in a line 
of poetry. “Among the dark boughs the golden 
orange glows,” lifts the object into the world of 
art, sets it in a picture, even gives it to us in the 
round, makes it moving and vital. “The fox- 
glove blooms centripetally,” one may say as dry 
fact, but when the poet says
-P-A-G-E-33
In the Education of Children 25 
The fox-gloves drop from throat to top 
A daily lesser bell, 
while he conveys the same fact, he does it in the 
terms of a definite single image, a specific indi- 
vidual process, that gives reality and distinction. 
It is by virtue of this method of presenting its 
material that literature performs another valu- 
able and definite service for the child. This lies 
in increasing and supplementing in many direc- 
tions his store of images. Of course, even the 
ordinary child has many images, since he has 
eyes and ears always open and fingers always 
active. But the sights and sounds he sees are 
not widely varied, and are rarely beautiful. It 
is the extraordinary, the occasional child who 
sees in his home many beautiful objects, 
who often hears good music, who sees in his 
street noble buildings, who is taken to the woods, 
the mountains, the sea, where he may store up 
many beautiful and distinguished images to serve 
him later for inner joy and as material for 
thinking. The other child whose experience is 
bounded by the streets, the shops, or the farm, 
will find his store of images increased and en- 
riched by contributions from literature. And the 
fact that the images and pictures in literature are 
given with concreteness, with vividness, with 
vitality in them, not as abstractions nor as tech-
-P-A-G-E-34
  
26 = Literature in the Elementary School 
nical description, gives them place in the con- 
sciousness side by side with those registered by 
the memory from actual experience, and they 
serve the same purposes. 
Indeed, the mere raising of a detail to the 
plane of art, the fitting of an image or a picture 
into a poem or a story, gives it new distinction 
and increases its value. Says Fra Lippo: 
- we're made so that we love 
First when we see them painted things we have passed 
Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see. 
So the child, when the details he knows or may 
know in real life are set in literature, sees them 
surrounded with a halo of new beauty and value. 
This halo, this well-known radiance of art, 
spreads itself over the objects that he sees about 
him, and they, too, take on a new beauty, and so 
pass into his storehouse of images with their 
meaning and usefulness increased. 
Whatever else may be the function of the 
imagination in literature it has these two—that 
of seeing and creating organic wholes, and that 
of presenting concrete images and pictures; 
these two would entitle it to a distinctive place 
in the training of a child’s imagination. 
As an accompaniment, perhaps as a conse- 
quence, of the tendency of the imagination 
to unify and harmonize its material by seeking
-P-A-G-E-35
In the Education of Children 27 
always a deeper basis and a larger category, and 
the other tendency to use in literature the 
specific detail rather than the generalization, we 
have the fact of figurative thinking and speak- 
ing as a characteristic of this art. A figure 
involves the discovery of a striking or essential 
contrast or contradiction between objects, or the 
recognition of a likeness or affinity ranging in 
closeness from mere similarity to complete 
identification. Whichever be the process, the 
result is the universal and typical meanings of 
literature, its pleasing indirection of statement, its 
enlarged outlook upon many other spheres, 
the vista of suggestion and association opening 
in every direction, the surprised, the shocked or 
delighted recognitions, that await us on every 
page. We will pass by as mystical and not demon- 
strable the inviting theory that a contact with 
these contrasts and resemblances may put into 
the hands of the child a clue to the better arrange- 
ment of the fragments that compose his world, 
and may help on in him that process of unifica- 
tion and identification which is the paramount 
human task; we must leave out of sight here, as 
too speculative and unpractical, the enlargement 
and definition of his categories that would come 
to the child as it comes to everyone, with even the 
most elementary recognition of the fundamental 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 Literature in the Elementary School 
separations and unions involved in figures; these 
we may leave aside, while we take the simple and 
quite obvious aspect of the matter—that the study 
and understanding of even the commoner figures 
quicken the child’s intelligence, and help to 
develop mental alertness and certainty. Not even 
a sense of humor is so useful in his intellectual 
experience as the ability to understand and use 
figures of speech. What makes so pathetic or so 
appalling a spectacle as the person who never 
catches the transferred and ironic turns of expres- 
sion of which even ordinary conversation is full? 
The poor belated mind stands helpless amidst the 
play of allusion that flashes all about him, and not 
even fear of thunder, which is the most alert 
sensation Emerson can attribute to him, can put 
him into touch with his kind. The best place 
to train a child toward quickness, the mental ease 
and adroitness that come of a ready under- 
standing and use of figure is in literature, one of 
whose signal characteristics is the use of figure. 
The appreciation of remote and delicate figures 
will, of course, come later in a student’s experi- 
ence than the elementary years, after he has had 
more contact with life and the world and a much 
widened experience in literature. But the child 
who has been taught to understand and to use
-P-A-G-E-37
  
In the Education of Children 29 
any of the simpler figures has been helped a long 
way on the road of art and philosophy. 
Literature differs from other kinds of writ- 
ing in its use of language, since it constantly 
aims at beautiful and striking expression. Since 
it often seeks beautiful and delicate effects, it is 
more often closely accurate than other kinds of 
writing; and since it sometimes seeks strong, 
noble effects, it is sometimes more vigorous than 
other writing. For the same and kindred 
reasons it seeks variety of expression, and so 
displays a larger choice of words, including new 
and rare words. These facts have an immediate 
and beneficial effect upon the style and vocabu- 
lary of the children. The fact is plainly obvious 
to anyone who has observed the superiority as to 
vocabulary and form of those children who have 
had much reading or who come from a literary 
family, and has seen the improvement of all the 
children in these matters as they add to their 
experience in literature. This enrichment and 
refinement of language must be reckoned among 
the distinctive services of literature. 
Literature, in common with the other arts, but 
unlike other kinds of writing, aims at beauty— 
cares first of all for beauty. One must under- 
stand the term, of course, as artistic or aesthetic 
beauty, as it has been interpreted for us from 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  
30 = Literature in the Elementary School 
Plato down, as quite other than mere prettiness 
or superficial attractiveness. First, in the selec- 
tion of its subject-matter it is the strikingly 
beautiful in nature, in character, in action, and 
in experience that it seeks out for presentation. 
When it uses ugly or horrible material, it is for 
one of these purposes: by way of bringing into 
stronger relief beauty actually presented beside it; 
by way of implying beauty not actually presented ; 
by way of producing the grotesque as a form of 
beauty; by way of awakening fear or terror, 
which are elements in one kind of beauty; or by 
way of accomplishing some exploitation or reform 
conceived by the artist as his duty or his oppor- 
tunity; so that the artist’s use of ugly material 
produces in every case some effect of beauty. 
Now the problem of the child’s contact with 
beauty as the material or subject-matter of 
literature is the problem of his contact with it 
anywhere else. We cannot too often remind 
ourselves that the material in literature is that of 
life and the actual world chosen out, often freed 
from accidental and temporary qualities, and put 
into suitable setting in art. It therefore makes 
an appeal not different in kind, and in many 
cases not different in intensity, from the appeal 
of objects perceived by the actual senses. Accept- 
ing once for all the conditions of the imagination,
-P-A-G-E-39
  In the Education of Children 31 
we must conclude that the effect upon the child’s 
taste is the same as in his contact with beautiful 
and noble objects under conditions of outer space. 
And as, when we adopt the psychology and 
pedagogy of Whitman’s “There was a child went 
forth,” believing that all that the little traveler 
encounters becomes really and truly a part of 
him, we are eager to have him encounter the 
most beautiful sights and sounds of the physical 
world, so we earnestly desire for him contact 
with the noble and beautiful objects and persons 
of the other-world of literature. 
In the second place, literature, whether it be 
handling beautiful material or for any reason 
dealing with ugly material, is always seeking 
beauty of form. There are the larger matters of 
art-form, such as unity, harmony, completeness, 
balance—those large beneficent elements of 
beauty which should be in the child’s literature 
as in all his other art, constituting the genial 
atmosphere which he breathes in without knowing 
it. Of course, one does not talk to him about 
them, but there they are in his story, his picture, 
his song, bringing their gift of certainty and 
repose. Then there are the more concrete and 
obvious details of formal beauty that belong dis- 
tinctively to the literary art, and are partly mat- 
ters of craftsmanship—the musical effect of the
-P-A-G-E-40
  32 Literature in the Elementary School 
spoken word, prose or verse, the choice word or 
phase, the beautiful arrangement of clause or 
sentence. Certain of these elements may be de- 
liberately brought to the child’s attention, others 
may not. But in either case they help to form the 
whole atmosphere of beauty and distinction that 
surrounds a bit of good literature. And we 
cannot fail to believe in the refining and stimu- 
lating influence upon the child’s taste of his con- 
tact with formal beauty in this as in the other 
arts. 
As distinctive of literature, setting it apart 
from other kinds of writing, one must note that 
it always has in it the warmth, the fervor, of 
emotion, “Dowered with the scorn of scorn, the 
love of love, the hate of hate,” is the poet, and 
always the glow of feeling lights up his line. 
“The foxglove blooms centripetally,” is cold and 
colorless, however interesting it may be as techni- 
cal fact, 
The fox-gloves drop from throat to top, 
A daily lesser bell 
quivers with emotional associations. “I come to 
bury Caesar not to praise him’—the caesura of 
that line is Mark Antony’s sob, and the sympa- 
thetic throb of the elementary class. 
The king sits in Dumfernline toun 
Drinking the blude-red wine
-P-A-G-E-41
In the Education of Children 33 
What strange thrill is this that goes down the 
eight-year-old’s spine at the sound of these 
words? 
It was an ancient mariner 
And he stoppeth one of three. 
The mere lines submerge us at once in a new 
atmosphere tingling with charmed excitement. 
One would like to say with some new meaning 
and emphasis that it is precisely this emotion, 
permeating, warming, and coloring literature, 
that gives it its reality, that establishes its hold, 
that gives it its relation to the world—on the one 
side reflecting life on the other producing life. 
But it is about this matter of emotion that the 
teacher’s dangers and misgivings lie. There are 
those who fix upon its emotional nature as 
grounds for suspicion, if not of condemnation, 
of literature as a means of discipline. And we 
must all hasten to confess that this atmosphere 
of emotion is the snare of the weak teacher and 
the curse of weak literature. Emotion displayed 
or aroused unworthily, or attached to inadequate 
or ignoble stimuli, is either mere sentimentality 
or undue enthusiasm. It should be reckoned 
nothing short of a crime to stimulate unduly a 
child’s emotion, and to awaken in him feelings 
for which his nature is not ripe. But the policy 
or theory of ignoring his emotions, of suppress-
-P-A-G-E-42
  34 ~~ Literature in the Elementary School 
ing them, or of keeping them subdued in school 
within the bounds of his mild pleasure in scientific 
observation or mathematical achievement, is 
surely short-sighted. If the day has not already 
come, it is fast approaching when we shall see 
that education means also the calling out and 
exercising of the feelings—when we shall realize 
the dessicating influence of American school train- 
ing upon the emotional nature of children. It 
should not be difficult for any teacher who has 
studied the problems of childhood, and who has 
learned something about judging literature, to 
choose such literary things as reflect and invite 
the kind and degree of feeling suitable for a 
child, as give him legitimate occasion for 
legitimate emotion, as exercise and cultivate 
this side of his nature, effecting in him that 
purifying discharge of emotion which Aristotle 
regarded as one of the helpful offices of litera- 
ture. It is a matter for rejoicing that in the 
atmosphere of feeling which surrounds literature 
and music we may counteract and balance in the 
child the hardening influence of his fact-studies 
and his general school discipline. 
The mere pragmatism of the teaching often 
turned against literature as a discipline, that every 
emotional state should eventuate in activity, is 
met by the contention that the admiration or con-
-P-A-G-E-43
  In the Education of Children 35 
tempt called out by the record of the courageous 
or cowardly deed, the apprehension and enjoy- 
ment of the musical line or the beautiful image, 
contain their own issue and event. They register 
at once a higher moral standard or a quickened 
and deepened taste. 
It has already been said, and it must be said 
again, that it is by virtue of this emotional grip 
coupled with the powerful and_ ever-to-be- 
reckoned-with instinct for imitation, that litera- 
ture takes hold upon us, passes into our lives, 
affecting our judgment, our ideals, our conduct. 
We live by admiration, hope, and love, 
And even as these are well and wisely placed, 
In dignity of being we ascend. 
says Wordsworth; and literature affords many 
opportunities of placing well and wisely these 
living and life-giving emotions. 
This brings us at once to the vision of another 
service rendered the child by literature. Here he 
is as if he looked upon life. He sees events 
worked out to the issue; he sees people expressing 
themselves in deeds and words, transforming 
themselves and others for good or bad, calling 
upon him for approval or condemnation, or for 
sympathy. He finds here his heroes, his ideals, 
his models. He learns manners without tears 
and morals without a sermon. In some sense he
-P-A-G-E-44
    36 © Literature in the Elementary School 
sees life steadily, and sees it whole, so that he 
widens his social horizon to take in these many 
groups of all sorts of men; mentally and morally 
he must enlarge to contain the persons and events 
he learns to know. It is impossible to overesti- 
mate the importance in a child’s moral life, 
whether we interpret this as a social or an indi- 
vidual matter, of the contribution made by litera- 
ture to his vision, his pattern, of society and of 
character. This ability of literature to influence 
the child’s inner life and his conduct is so real 
that it has as many dangers as advantages. 
There must be no mistakes in selecting for him, 
if he is to ascend in dignity of being by the steps 
of literature. It must contain those pictures of 
life and conduct that are fit and suitable for the 
child to witness, and possible for him to compre- 
hend. They must be sound to the core, arousing 
and permanently engaging his genuine interest 
and his best feelings. 
And after all, the best thing we can do for a 
child in teaching him literature is to give him a 
permanent and innocent joy. We all have 
our moods in which we are ready to say that the 
first unconscious, unpremeditated pleasure that 
comes of a bit of literature is the only result 
worth having. And we who are professing 
teachers of literature have times of abnormal
-P-A-G-E-45
  
In the Education oj Children 37 
sensitiveness to the scorn of the dilettante critics 
who call us academical and pedagogical. And 
though we know that pleasure in literature has its 
elements and its causes, both easily observable, 
and that taste may be fostered and grown by well- 
known processes, it is always a wholesome hour 
for us when we are thrust back upon the fact that, 
though we may have disciplined his imagination, 
and may have quickened his fancy; we may have 
awakened and strengthened his sense of beauty; 
we may have exercised and cultivated his emo- 
tions; we may have enlarged his outlook upon 
life, and have provided him with social and per- 
sonal ideals; it is nevertheless, better than all 
these because it includes most of them, if we have 
opened up for our scholar this permanent avenue 
of noble enjoyment. 
Now, not all these results will appear in all 
the children. Some of them the teacher will 
not see in any child of certain classes. They 
are not easily ponderable and measurable—even 
less so than those of other disciplines. It is easy 
to know when a child can multiply and divide. It 
is not easy to know when he is in a hopeful stage 
of literary experience. But it is only in the direc- 
tion of the results we have been discussing that 
the teacher of literature can always hopefully 
work.

  CHAPTER III 
THE KINDS OF LITERATURE AND THE ELEMENTS 
OF LITERATURE SERVICEABLE IN THE ELE- 
MENTARY SCHOOL 
In modern literary study we have been placing 
much emphasis upon the kinds or species of 
literary production. In the light of the aesthetics 
of our day and the newer psychology of art we 
have been learning much concerning the nature, © 
the function, and one might say the habits of 
these species. These studies have coincided in 
time, most opportunely for the teacher of litera- 
ture, with those that have aimed at the establish- 
ing of the needs and tastes of the elementary 
and adolescent ages. There is a real satisfaction 
born of the confidence one feels in approaching 
his problem of choosing literature for children 
from these two largest points of view—that of the 
species or fundamental kinds of literature on the 
one hand, that of the child’s actual needs and 
tastes on the other. This method of approach 
seems to put the whole field adequately before 
his view, and to give authority and certainty to 
his final choice. 
As a matter of fact there are certain character- 
38  
-P-A-G-E-47
  
Kinds and Elements 39 
istics invariable and inevitable in each of the 
five species of literature—epic, drama, lyric, 
fiction, essay—that tell us at once something of 
its fitness for our purpose. The essay, for 
example in its typical form is by its essential 
nature inappropriate. The literary essay, as it is 
actually constituted, is in subject-matter too 
abstract and remote, in mood too complex and 
intricate, and in style too allusive and evasive. Its 
invitation is to a region for which a child has 
neither chart nor map.. The essay rests upon 
‘old, old presuppositions; these very presuppo- 
sitions it is that must be slowly and through many 
experiences built into the mental life of the child. 
To be sure, there are a few bits called essays— 
such as certain of Lamb’s more anecdotal papers, 
some of the narrative numbers of The Spectator, 
nature-studies with marked literary qualities like 
some of those of John Burroughs—that the 
grades can understand and enjoy. But these are 
not typical essays, and they have not the true 
essay spirit. This spirit, which creates for itself 
an atmosphere hard to describe, compounded as 
it is of universal knowingness, ironic indirection, 
delicately intellectual emotion, and faintly emo- 
tional intellectuality—this spirit is quite alien to 
childhood. 
And as it is actually constituted, the literary
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 = Literature in the Elementary School 
drama, too, represents a life and presents an art- 
form so complex and so mature as to be beyond 
a child’s grasp. Not until this period is closing— 
and with many children not even then—comes 
the hour of ripeness for the drama. This ques- 
tion of the child and dramatic literature has so 
many conditions and modifications that it must 
be discussed at length in another chapter. But it 
is evident to every sympathetic student of child- 
hood that this is not the period to present the 
complex situations, the difficult problems, the 
over-ripe experiences, that prevailingly constitute 
the material of literary drama. 
The literature we do give the children should 
correspond to the stage of their development 
in matching as nearly as may be, in tone and 
spirit their own activities and interests, or should 
be calculated to arouse in them those interests 
and activities they ought legitimately to have. It 
should be of that kind that gives a large free 
sweep of activity; that reveals character and con- 
duct in their simpler, open aspects; that exhibits 
literary art phenomena in their plainer, more 
striking varieties. These qualities are to be found 
in chosen specimens of the three other species of 
literature—epic, fiction, lyric. Of course’ one 
must select from each of the three those speci- 
mens that do exhibit the qualities he seeks. 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  Kinds and Elements 41 
He could not offer to children a developed epic 
in its entirety; but there are many things of the 
epic kind—ballads, hero-tales, fairy-sagas, certain 
detachable sections of the great epics themselves 
—precisely suited to them. We would not intro- 
duce them into a mature novel, but there are 
Marchen for them, tales of conquest and adven- 
ture, stories of other children’s doings. They 
would be lost and bored in the presence of the 
elegy or the sonnet; but we may find jingles and 
songs, and later on odes, fit and right for them. 
In the epic kind of literature we include not only 
the epic, but all those other poetic compositions 
whose principles of organization is narrative— 
ballad, pastoral, idyll, etc. The presupposition in 
favor of them.as good for the children (and it 
is borne out by the demonstration) lies in these 
two facts: they are concerned with events and 
achievements, and are therefore likely to be 
active and objective; they proceed by the method 
of story—the easiest and most helpful for the 
child to follow and to grasp. It seems necessary 
to say again that the members of the epic group 
must be scanned as narrowly with reference to 
their fitness in subject-matter and suitability in 
form as those of any other group. There is a 
fallacy in the assumption that epic is a childlike 
thing, the product of the childhood of the race.
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 Literature in the Elementary School 
This is akin to the amusing opinion that myth— 
Greek myth, for example—is a childlike accumu- 
lation of childish inventions. Nay, epic poetry, 
even those epics that seem most nearly folk- 
poetry—the Béowulf, for example—are built 
upon hoary civilizations, each of them having 
behind it an art-tradition already old. And if 
there is an unwarranted assumption in the theory 
that epic is childlike, there is an unwarrantable 
presumption in the theory that the mature per- 
son outgrows it—that its appeal is only to a primi- 
tive and undeveloped taste. The value to the 
child of the epic is in its objectivity and activity, 
its large horizons and big spaces. The taste for 
these things should survive and grow stronger, 
as should every good taste planted and fostered 
in childhood. The mature person but adds to his 
enjoyment of these things a deeper enjoyment as 
he grows to appreciate the finer details and sub- 
tler meanings hidden from the child. The merest 
primary child can love and enjoy the heroic or 
amusing adventures of Odysseus ; he should enjoy 
them equally when he is forty; but by that time 
he will have added the ability to appreciate also 
the wealth of artistic detail, the profound knowl- 
edge of human nature, the large mental and reli- 
gious atmosphere of the poem. For most of this 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  
Kinds and Elements 43 
added enjoyment the child has and should have 
no intellectual welcome, no space yet ready. 
Therefore, in giving the great epics, the 
teacher must know what aspects, details, and 
episodes to pass by or to pass lightly over. And 
he must look carefully to the fitness of any piece 
of this kind he may consider. It is not sufficient 
that it have a story. For example Sohrab and 
Rustum is a little epic which fits perfectly certain 
seventh or eighth grades, because, in addition to 
a sufficiently good story, it has an atmosphere of 
vast spaces and large movements, a wealth of 
broad, noble details; and above all, it handles 
and evokes a simple, primitive emotion, a sor- 
row which is as impersonal as the sorrows of 
Odysseus—a true epic sorrow. In contrast, 
Enoch Arden, another piece of the epic kind, is 
not adapted to children of any age, because it 
displays a complex domestic and psychic situa- 
tion which no child ought to be called upon 
to realize, while the emotion called for is both 
in kind and amount the sentimentality of adults. 
Even among the folk-ballads the same discrimi- 
nation must guide us. Sir Patrick Spens is the 
boy’s own; while the poignant pathos of Young 
Waters, true and piercing as it is, is not for the 
boy to feel. 
So, as will be said many times, but always 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 Literature in the Elementary School 
with meaning, we choose, when we are sane, not 
the novel, complex in plot, involved in motive, 
overcharged in emotional atmosphere, but the 
simple, direct-moving romance, the hero-tale, 
whose subject-matter and method are so broad 
and universal as to fit even the child. We can 
welcome, for example, the hearty boyishness 
of Quentin Durward or Kidnapped, where we 
could not pilot our elementary class safe through 
the social and ethical sophistications of The 
Heart of Midlothian, nor steer them intelligently 
through the involved structure and difficult nar- 
rative medium of The Master of Ballantrae. 
So with the lyric form. If one’s choice of a 
lyric lay between “The splendor falls on castle 
walls” and “Tears, idle tears,” he would renounce 
the complex mature moods, the figures and allu- 
sions for which the child’s experience has given 
him no preparation, the pervading tone of rich 
melancholy of the one, in favor of the buoyant 
objectivity and more obvious emotional mood 
of the other. 
Through all the earlier years of the elementary 
school with some classes, and in some communi- 
ties throughout the period, the literary experience 
of the children may best be made up from speci- 
mens of these three species. It may be, however, 
that certain seventh or eighth grades (merely to  
-P-A-G-E-53
Kinds and Elements 45 
name the older children) will be found mature 
enough to profit by the study of certain of the 
more heroic literary dramas. The same tests 
of objectivity and simplicity must be applied in 
selecting these. We should choose, for example, 
the obvious, and boisterous fun of The Comedy 
of Errors, rather than the half-hidden satire of A 
Midsummer-Night’s Dream; Julius Caesar, since 
it may fitly be taught as a heroic tragedy; Mac- 
beth, which, however violent in motive and 
method, is still direct and simple enough to be 
within the child’s imaginative realization. 
In most schools also, we may count upon find- 
ing in these oldest children in the elementary 
grades some power of meditation, some interest 
in abstract questions, some appreciation of 
humor and wit, much love of eloquence; so that 
in this last year they may profitably read in class 
some essays. To be sure, we will choose, not 
Montaigne, but Bacon; not Pater, but John Bur- 
roughs; not Dream Children, but A Dissertation 
on Roast Pig. In short, we will avoid the 
critical and the mystical in essays, and give them 
objective out-of-door essays like Wake-Robin, 
humorous anecdotal essays like Old China, elo- 
quent oratorical essays like Gladstone’s Kin Be- 
yond Sea. 
Indeed, during this seventh and eighth grade  
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 Literature in the Elementary School 
| 
period begins the child’s hour of ripeness for 
eloquence and oratory. And it is wise and easy 
to meet and supply his interest with essays of the 
address variety, which do for him the character- 
istic services performed by the literary essay, at 
the same time that they satisfy his awakening 
hunger for the rolling music of the oratorical 
form, answer to his dawning interest in the big 
world and great questions, and help to build a 
bridge for him into the public speaking and dra- 
matic aspects of his literary work that he will 
find, or ought to find, in the secondary school. 
For want of a good term, I have used, in the 
title to this chapter, the word “elements” to 
designate all the details that go to make up the 
literary work of art. Into this term we cover, 
for mere convenience, and to avoid cumbering 
ourselves with a tiresome and profitless bit of 
syllabus-making, these and such matters: struc- 
ture, story, plot, incident, character, verse, image, 
figure, epithet, and many other details used 
to produce the total effect of a bit of literature. 
It becomes necessary to inquire which among 
these elements we shall expect to find serviceable 
for our purpose. Of course, they are all valu- 
able even for a child in the sense that they all 
contribute to the general effect upon his con- 
sciousness; but certain of them may profitably
-P-A-G-E-55
  Kinds and Elements 47 
be brought into high light and deliberately im- 
pressed upon the class; others would best be left 
lying by for his adult appreciation. 
Take for example, the matter of structure, 
by which we mean the larger plan or composition 
by virtue of which the bit of art—poem or story 
—has a beginning a middle and an end; by vir- 
tue of which it starts somewhere, proceeds in an 
orderly manner, and reaches a destination; as, for 
example, in our ever admirable The Old Woman 
Who Found the Sixpence, where you have the 
sixpence found, the pig bought, the obstacles on 
the road home, the acquiescence of the cat, the 
unraveling of the difficulties, the safe return 
home—a most orderly interdependence and 
sequence of incidents; or, as an example of a 
different kind of structure, Stevenson’s Foreign 
Lands: the child climbing the cherry tree sees his 
own garden at his feet, his neighbor’s garden 
over the wall, follows the white road to its disap- 
pearance, traces the river to its vanishment, fol- 
lows it in his mind’s eye to its fall into the far- 
away sea, and then strays on and on into the 
other-world of his own fancy—a perfect vanish- 
ing perspective; or examine with this matter of 
structure in mind Tennyson’s Bugle-Song, where 
you will find a balanced, orderly composition— 
the horn, the actual echo, the spiritual echo.
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 Literature in the Elementary School 
Nothing in literature has a higher educational 
value than this element of orderly structure, of 
good “composition.” It should be unobtrusively 
present in practically everything the class learns, 
and should be deliberately brought to notice, and 
should be provided for in everything the children 
produce. It stands to reason that the story is the 
form which will most constantly and most easily 
present this element of structure, and that in their 
study of stories the children can best be im- 
pressed with a sense of their bit of art as a whole 
made up of parts. This aspect of story, as well 
as the consideration of plot, incident, and charac- 
ter, will receive a more extended treatment than 
can be given here, in the special chapter on story. 
As to the smaller elements of literature, it is 
rather contrary to the best educational thinking 
of our day to expect the elementary child to show 
much appreciation of them. It would be a mis- 
take to place any emphasis in teaching him upon 
delicate or obscure phases of these elements; 
though there will be, naturally, within the 
period a growing fineness of appreciation and 
quickness of perception in these matters. Among 
the youngest children the elements to be empha- 
sized are chiefly those concerned with the 
musical effects of speech. The teacher will 
do everything possible to develop and culti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  Kinds and Elements 49 
vate in the child a love of rhythm—the musical 
flow of language, whether of verse or prose. In 
the verse he will try to awaken an enjoyment 
of rhyme and of meter, of any specially musical 
collocation of words, of instances of tone- 
color or other poetic harmony. This cultiva- 
tion of the child’s ear for literature should go on 
through his whole school life. It should be one 
of the considerations that weigh in choosing the 
material for his literary training even through- 
out his college experience, in order that his ear 
for musical speech may grow ever more subtle, 
more responsive to the delicate and noble caden- 
ces of poetry and of beautiful prose. Beautiful 
and musical speech is the crowning quality of 
literature, and the final note of distinction in 
style, and no amount of originality in image or 
figure, no degree of delicate fitness in word or 
phrase, no perfection of skill in logical coherence 
and arrangement, should persuade us to forgo it. 
In a class of the younger children the teacher 
may hope to get attention to an occasional image 
or larger picture; he may even occasionally secure 
some deliberate consideration of a figure. And 
he may be sure, whether their interest in these 
minor matters be steady and deliberate or not, 
that he is at least helping them all the while to
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 ~—- Literature in the Elementary School 
new and useful words, and to a constantly im- 
proved sentence-form. 
As they grow older, and capable of more atten- 
tion and patience, they grow rapidly more able 
to give conscious consideration to literary details. 
The children of fifth and sixth-grade age will 
linger over especially beautiful and appropriate 
words, will stop to realize in detail the pictures, 
and will consider figures long enough to appro- 
priate them artistically. The normal child has 
an interesting history with regard to figures of 
speech. Personification he accepts at once. In- 
deed, it is perhaps not a figure to him, but a 
reality, though he seems to get out of it a con- 
scious artistic joy. Such personification as “the 
daffodil unties her yellow bonnet” he can see and 
appreciate as figure. Metaphor is his native 
speech, and, so long as it involves no material 
beyond his power of realization, he has no trouble 
with it—in appreciating it or in producing it. 
Simile is more baffling; it is easier to go immedi- 
ately and intuitively to the meaning of a meta- 
phor than to carry in the mind the two expressed 
sides of the simile. The younger children 
are puzzled and confused by the details of 
a Homeric simile. But children old enough to 
read Sohrab and Rustum, if they have been 
taught how to hold their minds on an artistic
-P-A-G-E-59
  
  Kinds and Elements 51 
detail, are willing to stop and appreciate the two 
groups of details in each of Arnold’s similes. But 
no elementary child will make a Homeric, or in- 
deed any simile, except as a tour de force. Antith- 
esis as a striking and obvious figure is easy and 
illuminating to children, and seems to come to 
them quite spontaneously in their own composing. 
The more subtle figures they will neither appre- 
ciate nor use within our period. The fable as 
allegory and the more extended allegories, even 
those complex enough to be called symbol- 
istic stories, the seventh and eighth grades in 
the average school will read and interpret 
acceptably. On the whole, we may expect to 
give most of the children some knowledge of the 
literary nature and function of simple figures, 
and to awaken in them an ability to enjoy and 
understand the figurative and allusive atmosphere 
characteristic of literature. 
This seems to be the appropriate place to 
speak of irony, which, while not, of course, a 
figure of speech, but rather a way of thinking, 
does frequently help to produce the allusive and 
indirect tone in literature. It must be the art- 
playfulness of irony that tempts most people, 
when they write for children or talk with them, 
to adopt some form of this method of speaking. 
But this method of communing with little peo-  
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 Literature in the Elementary School 
ple is full of dangers; while a pervading and 
abiding atmosphere of irony is most unfair to 
them. Slow children are baffled and stupefied by 
it; quick children all too soon catch and adopt 
the element of insincerity underlying it. Never- 
theless, passages of ironic intent, together with 
occasional brief bits in the ironic manner, are 
educative, quickening the children artistically and 
intellectually. A little girl of five beamed with 
intellectual delight and artistic triumph when she 
said to her mother: “Now I can almost always 
tell when grown people are speaking irons.” 
Concerning the whole matter of wit and 
humor in literature the same thing may be said 
that is said of irony. Children are quickened 
and stimulated intellectually by frequent calls to 
understand and appreciate passages of witty and 
humorous writing, or by an occasional and short 
piece whose whole atmosphere is of this kind. 
But from the point of view of their literary train- 
ing and general appreciation of art, it is better to 
awaken in them and maintain a serious appre- 
ciation of greatness and beauty. Besides, the 
child’s out-of-school experience may, in many 
communities, be relied upon to give him sufficient 
contact with the ironic and humorous forms of 
art, literary and otherwise. 
To sum up, then, may we say that it is safe
-P-A-G-E-61
Kinds and Elements 53 
to conclude that within the elementary period we 
will rely for the children’s literary experience 
upon specimens of the three species—epic, lyric, 
fiction—introducing, in the older classes, when 
the conditions seem to justify it, a few simple 
and heroic dramas, and perhaps a few essays, 
choosing them from those that exhibit the more 
direct kind of humor, that are objective in char- 
acter, or that serve as an introduction to oratory 
and eloquence? 
We may feel contented if we have succeeded 
in cultivating an appreciation of the musical side 
of speech—among the younger children an enjoy- 
ment of the obvious things of meter and rhyme, 
reaching in the older children enjoyment of the 
rhythm of prose, and many of the more subtle 
harmonies of arrangement and tone-color. We 
may hopefully labor to impress upon them 
a sense of structure, an appreciation of “com- 
position.” We may refine and build upon their 
instinctive love of story, until we see it taking 
on within this period the certainty of a culti- 
vated taste. We may develop in them some 
power to linger over epithet and image and figure, 
thus beginning to build up in them a sense of 
craftsmanship, and love of beautiful detail, 
both of which must enter into one’s appreciation 
of any art before his judgment is safe and his 
 
-P-A-G-E-62

appreciation satisfying. And the teacher who 
knows how may hope to do all these things joy- 
ously and unobtrusively, so that literature may 
remain what it should always be—a charming 
and refined variety of play.
-P-A-G-E-63
CHAPTER IV 
STORY 
Story is, in general, the narrative of a suc- 
cession of incidents or events. It is a large, 
general form or device, useful, indeed inevitable, 
in all subjects. Like language itself, story is a 
universal medium, conveying the facts of his- 
tory, of science, of life. Whenever we have the 
steps of any experience arranged according to 
any of the laws of subsequence or consequence, 
we have story; such as the story of the dande- 
lion seed, the story of the life of Mary Stuart, 
the story of the invention of the steam engine, 
the story of a day in the city. Now, the 
narration of the events in mere chronological 
sequence is story. As soon as they are arranged 
in the order of cause and effect—or in any other 
chosen order; as soon as the narrative leads up to 
‘an end or a signal event; as soon as it shows that 
there has been for any purpose a selection and 
ordered arrangement of the steps or incidents, 
we have a story. The literary story—the story 
which is art—differs from other stories in the fact 
that in it the principle of selection and arrange- 
ment operates more thoroughly than in the others. 
55  
-P-A-G-E-64
    56 = Literature in the Elementary School 
A narrative detailing for technical purposes the 
steps of an occurrence in nature or in history must 
follow closely either the sequence of time or the 
order of cause and effect; and such a report can- 
not choose among the steps or incidents, but must 
as a matter of mere fairness, suppress nothing 
and heighten nothing. It is otherwise with the 
literary story. Here the incidents may be selected 
at the discretion of the author and arranged in 
whatever order may best serve to produce his 
effect ; insignificant steps may be eliminated, cer- 
tain steps may be elaborated and brought into 
higher light. The will of the artist and his artis- 
tic effect constitute a force which may abrogate 
the laws of cause and effect, or of precedence 
and subsequence in time. 
The interest in story is instinctive and uni- 
versal; the merest string of incidents will attract 
and hold attention. Interest and attention natur- 
ally increase and deepen with the greater organ- 
ization of the material. It is this principle of 
organization that gives to literary stories some 
of their unique and distinctive values in educa- 
tion. No method of organization but that of story 
keeps the younger child’s attention long enough 
and closely enough to carry him undistracted 
through a large whole. He cannot follow, as can 
his elders, the flow of emotion which constitutes
-P-A-G-E-65
Story 57 
the thread of continuity in a lyric; he cannot fol- 
low a train of thinking through an essay; but he 
can follow the run of a narrative through even a 
long story. This fact enables us to put him satis- 
factorily and pleasantly into the presence of a 
large organized bit of material, in which he can 
discriminate the parts, yet which he can grasp as 
a whole; which he can see as an entity beginning 
somewhere, proceeding in order, reaching an end. 
The temptation to amplify the statement of 
the influence in the child’s whole mental experi- 
ence of this fostering and disciplining of his 
powers of attention is difficult to resist. But we 
will leave it with these few words in order to 
speak of the specifically artistic and literary 
results of this matter of structure in the story. 
It is a thing hard to insist upon as a matter of 
general theory, because written down in cold 
black and white it seems to convey the impression 
that emphasis is placed upon mere colorless organ- 
ization; as if one obliged his children to make an 
analytical syllabus of their pleasant tale before 
he regarded it as taught. But it is no such dull 
thing. Beauty and economy of structure lie upon 
the very surface of the best bits of literature, and 
need but the most unobtrusive reinforcement 
from the teacher to work their effect of pleasure 
and discipline. This pleasure is an artistic prod-  
-P-A-G-E-66
  
  58 Literature in the Elementary School 
uct which should expand and develop with the 
child’s reading, until, when he is a mature stu- 
dent, the formal structure of poem or story gives 
him the same aesthetic and moral satisfaction that 
he gets from a picture well composed, a monu- 
ment well balanced. It is not a fancy or a mere 
pretty theory that a good story, taught as a struc- 
ture, becomes a norm, a model, a clue to the child 
in the preservation of his own material, and in 
the arrangement of it economically and effectively. 
His attention is trained, his patience is rewarded, 
his taste refined, his judgment exercised and 
steadied, his imagination guided and channeled by 
his contact with a complete, beautiful, and logical 
creation, whose elements he can see and handle 
as he can those of the story. 
From the point of view of the larger structure 
of the story its elements are’ the incidents. This 
term is employed in this chapter rather arbitrarily 
to designate those smallest separable units of 
progress by which a story goes forward. It does 
not necessarily designate a section of the story 
which records a happening; the introductory 
and explanatory paragraph we call an incident; a 
paragraph of description is an incident; the 
separable sections of the story as it moves are its 
incidents. A new incident begins when a certain 
aspect of the action closes, when a new day opens,
-P-A-G-E-67
  Story 59 
a new person enters, a change of scene occurs, 
or even a shift from dialogue to narration; any 
of these and many other things may cause or 
signalize a new incident. Study for example, 
Grimm’s Briar-Rose, which divides naturally and 
inevitably into ten separable incidents, and which 
exhibits a beautiful and artistic organization. 
A teacher should master this aspect of every 
story he proposes to teach. He should know it 
intimately asaseries of incidents; for these are the 
things he can manipulate as he uses the story—in 
case he must shorten it or dramatize it, or other- 
wise modify it to suit his needs. If he knows how 
to handle incidents, he may often by a little edit- 
ing eliminate superfluous matter and convert a 
loose, overburdened, or merely long story into a 
usable bit of art. 
Practically every story that has the length and 
dignity to justify its use for a class, gathers its 
incidents into movements that correspond to the 
three or five acts of a drama. There is something 
almost biologically necessary in at least three parts 
or movements in every organized narrative— 
Aristotle’s obvious beginning, middle, and end. 
In a story it is but natural that we should have 
(1) a section presenting the people and their sur- 
roundings, the circumstances which call for or 
dictate the action; (2) the central event, the essen-
-P-A-G-E-68
     
60 Literature in the Elementary School 
tial adventure; (3) the dénouement, conclusion, 
reconciliation, adjustment, or what not. These 
three movements are beautifully distinct in the 
Briar-Rose. It helps to impress upon the chil- 
dren the structure of the story if in the study 
of it these movements are brought to notice— 
quietly and unobtrusively, perhaps indicated by a 
mere pause in the telling, or on occasion, more 
deliberately by some other means. The story 
should not be so handled as to make the im- 
pression that there are abrupt gaps between the 
movements; rather these movements should be 
treated as essential parts of a larger composition. 
In the stories of the dramas the children may 
study, and in all such stories as they themselves 
dramatize, they will inevitably see that these 
stages or movements are essential and vital, dic- 
tating the organization of the material into acts. 
Within the arrangement of the story as inci- 
dents and movements lies a deeper kind of organ- 
ization which exhibits many kinds and degrees of 
complexity. A story may be a run of inci- 
dents that report mere activity. So deep and 
eager is the hunger for story, so unfailing is the 
primitive epic interest, that almost anybody’s at- 
tention may be held for a long while by the recital 
of the merely juxtaposed incidents that constitute 
this story of activity. But there is no art in this;  
-P-A-G-E-69
  Story 61 
it is mere story-stuff, not a story. Under the 
manipulation of the literary artist, the tale-teller, 
it takes shape, shifts its incidents about, ar- 
ranges its stages and emerges a created and 
organic thing, telling now of action, not of 
activity. It may be a long narrative, or it 
may be a mere anecdote. But it has a purpose 
and a plan, and it reaches an end. This straight- 
forward, single-minded tale does not, however, 
give complete and final satisfaction. In the first 
place, it does not represent life, which never pro- 
ceeds far by single, uninterrupted threads; events 
are interlinked and complicated, modified and 
diverted in many directions. In the second place, 
it does not satisfy the instinct of workmanship in 
the artist. Even the most primitive artist, the 
very folk itself, has this instinct of craftsmanship 
which expresses itself in the elaboration and en- 
richment of its product. In story this instinct 
displays itself in the more skilful arrangement 
of the incidents, looking ever to the heightening 
and deepening of effect, in the enrichment of the 
presentation by weaving together more than one 
action into a more and more complex whole. Such 
increased elaboration, and more conscious organ- 
ization either in the arrangement of the incidents 
of a single action, or in the interweaving of two 
or more actions, gives the story a plot.
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 Literature in the Elementary School 
It is from the use of stories elaborate enough 
and developed enough to have a plot that genuine 
disciplinary value may be expected. The merely 
chaotic or haphazard run of incidents may amuse 
and interest the children, but it yields nothing of 
artistic training. Two very simple specimens (use- 
ful for so many purposes) will illustrate the point. 
Take the story adumbrated in The House That 
Jack Built. This is a series of incidents linked 
together in the accumulative fashion, but proceed- 
ing in a straight line and and stopping short off 
without issue or event. Compare it with the 
equally primitive accumulative tale of The Old 
Woman Who Found the Sixpence, from which 
invaluable tale one can exemplify all the main 
devices of successful plot-making; the incidents 
are arranged in a charming pattern, so that the 
action rises to a summit, descends to an end, and 
produces an effect; there is the proper propor- 
tion of involution (save the mark!), of the mak- 
ing of difficulties, stating the problem, awakening 
our sympathies; this is followed by the due pro- 
cess of resolution, unraveling the difficulties, with 
the final restoration of the action to the normal 
level with the purpose of the story achieved. It 
is this kind of story that adds to interest and 
amusement that additional charm of artistic struc-
-P-A-G-E-71
  Story 63 
ture which distinguishes literature from mere 
writing. 
Now, while it is true that a symmetrical plot 
constitutes in part the educational value of a story, 
it is quite obvious to those who know both chil- 
dren and stories that intricate and elaborate plots 
should not be given to folks in the elementary 
classes. A story in which the threads of the plot 
are many or disparate, or one in which the actions 
must be often, or for any long while, kept sepa- 
rate, confuses rather than trains the young chil- 
dren. Better for them are those stories whose 
plots are open and simple, where the actions of the 
interlinked threads coincide as much as possible. 
Certain traditional plot devices are out of place 
in a story chosen for these children; suspense 
and mystification, for example, those devices 
so dear in their myriad forms to the cheap and 
sensational novelist, and so indispensable to 
the interest of the uncultivated reader, are not 
desirable in the children’s class. Their inter- 
est needs no such stimulus; their attention should 
not be subjected to the strain, nor their nerves to 
the shock, of a sustained suspense with its conse- 
quent surprise. Rather, their story should move 
openly and directly, depending for its power upon 
the skilful interrelation of its interests, yielding 
the pleasure of recognition and sympathy, so much
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 ~=Literature in the Elementary School 
more artistic and disciplinary than the pleasure of 
surprise. For this reason plots of the type of 
Shakespeare’s great plots, of the type of Perrault’s 
Cinderella, in which the reader is in the confidence 
of the author from the beginning, are to be 
desired for the little people. If for any reason 
it seems well to tell to the younger children a 
long story built upon suspense and surprise, it is 
generally well to let them know very soon the 
issue of affairs—the ultimate disaster or recon- 
ciliation—so that they may be free from anxiety 
and able to attend to the more real matter of the 
story as it proceeds. This teaching applies to the 
younger children; as they grow older, they 
become able to get desirable intellectual experi- 
ence out of a good detective story, or one with a 
fairly deep mystification in it, like Treasure 
Island. The older children, too, may profitably 
handle a more intricate plot—Ivanhoe with its 
four threads of interest and activity, The Mer- 
chant of Venice with‘the action shifting about 
from scene to scene among its various groups. 
By handling a plot as a matter of literary 
study we mean, examining it from these points of 
view. 
1. What are the difficulties set up? 
2. By what devices are the difficulties consti-
-P-A-G-E-73
  
Story 65 
tuted—conspiracy, intrigue, disguise, quarrel 
blood-feud, race-hatred, etc., etc. ? 
3. How are the difficulties removed? 
4. How many threads of interest has the plot? 
5. How are they linked together or inter- 
woven? 
6. How logical and how fair is the outcome? 
Other questions to be considered in studying 
the plot will arise in the study of an actual story 
with an actual class. 
Of fundamental interest in the story are the 
persons or characters, and it is of prime impor- 
tance that teachers—be they mothers or masters 
—should know how to educate the children in 
this matter. 
From one point of view—that of the 
activities of the story, in which the younger 
children are mainly interested—there are two 
kinds of persons: those who do things; those who 
receive things, or for whose sake, or merely in 
whose presence, things are done. The former are 
the agents—the pushing, active adventurous per- 
sons, who, good or ill, make things happen; the 
latter are often mere figures, important and per- 
haps beautiful, put into the story to represent 
institutions or ideas—like the father of Cinderella, 
who is merely an institutional father; or they are 
devices for getting on with the plot, like the fairy 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  66 = Literature in the Elementary School 
godmother ; or they are the rewards of endeavor, 
like the King’s daughter given in marriage in 
many a folk-tale. From another point of view, 
which regards the actors in the story, not as per- 
sons, but as characters, they may be divided into 
two types; those who are fixed, static, from the 
beginning—who come into the story fully equip- 
ped, and do not change at all within its limits; 
those who change or develop under the influ- 
ence of others and of their experiences. 
In the study of characters more than in any 
other aspect of story, we must allow for the 
growth of the children within the elementary 
period. The youngest children are prepared to 
appreciate the activities of people, and are inter- 
ested in the active persons, and by transfer of 
sympathy, in the persons for whose sake the deeds 
are done. Their typical readiness in reading 
character does not fail them when the character 
has been transferred to literature. They are quick 
to discriminate the main lines and the distinguish- 
ing traits of personality. They need only a few 
facts and signs. The merest nursery child will be 
found to have settled views of the general charac- 
ter of LittleBoy Blue and Jack Horner, built upon 
the slender but significant data of the rhymes. 
But the children I have known have not, up to the 
sixth grade, followed with much interest or
-P-A-G-E-75
  
Story 67 
profit any but the slightest and simplest charac- 
ter progression or modification. They are satis- 
fied that the wicked should become more and more 
wicked, to their final undoing; that the stupid 
become stupider, to their ultimate extinction; but 
any evolution of character other than this cumu- 
lative one, any transformation more subtle than 
the conversion of Cinderella’s sisters, or more 
delicate than the degeneration of Struwelpeter, 
finds them languid. 
From these facts the wise teacher takes his 
hints and builds his plans. He will give these 
younger children very little of what is known in 
mature classes as character-study—which so easily 
in these same older classes, degenerates into gossip 
and the merely idle or pernicious attributing of 
motives. He will help the child, on the whole, 
to judge from his deeds whether a man is good or 
bad; helpful or hindering. But no deed is all mere 
activity ; back of it lie motives and passions, and 
beyond it lie moral and social results. There is a 
name for Little Boy Blue’s failure in duty, and 
for Jack MHorner’s self-approval; and these 
qualities have manifestations in forms and cir- 
cumstances other than those of these two heroes. 
To these simple deed-inspiring motives and pas- 
sions, and to their effects on the persons them- 
selves, the teacher must see that the children’s  
-P-A-G-E-76
68 Literature in the Elementary School 
attention is directed ; so that, as he builds up stroke 
by stroke the image of his hero and model, the 
features that he gets from literature at least may 
be supported by his judgment. 
Of course, as they advance the children 
awaken, or should be awakened, to some of the 
more delicate discriminations of motive and 
action—to the conception of a man who is mixed 
good and bad; and to a realization of a character 
changed under our eyes by some experience or by 
the influence of another person; to some esti- 
mate of the farther-reaching consequences of the 
deeds we witness in our story. And before they 
have finally passed out of the elementary grades, 
we may expect them to be able to consider the 
problems and contradictions that lie, for example, 
in the character of Shylock; they could see his 
fundamental passions—race-hatred, avarice; they 
could estimate his motives—personal dislike of 
the merchant, revenge of his own wrongs and 
loneliness ; they could try to estimate the effect of 
his character and conduct on the fortunes and 
characters of the whole group; and finally upon 
his own fortunes. They might, in the same gen- 
eral and simple way, follow the spiritual strug- 
gles of Brutus: his great underlying passions— 
patriotism and love of friend; his immediate 
motives to save his country ; the effect of his deed;
-P-A-G-E-77
  Story 69 
the telling contrasts between him and Cassius, 
him and Mark Antony. 
The study of character in these broader lines 
—the fundamental qualities or passions, the mo- 
tives that bring about the action, the obvious 
results in personal and social ways of these 
actions—constitutes the utmost we should try to 
do in this direction, leaving for a later period, 
when the children’s social interests are broadened, 
and when they have developed from within a 
deeper sense of moral experience, the more deli- 
cate and difficult matters of the evolution and 
interplay of character. 
Of equal importance in a story with the run of 
events or plot, and with the persons or characters, 
is this third thing—the outcome or issue. It is 
surely wise to follow, for the younger children, 
the hint given by their own tastes and by the 
primitive story-tellers, to the extent of giving 
them prevailingly such stories as have a distinct 
and signal outcome, leaving the uncertainties and 
inconclusions of a thoroughgoing realism for a 
much later period. It is best, on the whole, that 
the children see the issues of their story settled, 
the actions passing on to accomplishment—this 
for the artistic as well as for the moral effect 
of the tale. It enables them to regard it as a 
finished whole, having unity and completeness; 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  7o ~— Literature in the Elementary School 
and it throws light on all the events and persons 
in the story, to see how things come out in the end. 
The outcome or issue can be looked at from 
one or the other, sometimes from both, of two 
points of view; as a dénouement or round-up of 
the particular story in hand; or as a solution of a 
human problem, a universal situation. The entirely 
satisfying dénouement of The Old Woman Who 
Found the Sixpence, the removal of her many 
difficulties, goes no farther than getting her home 
that night; though, of course, a mature mind of 
mystic tendencies may see in it a triumph of 
social co-operation. It will be enough for the 
third grade to feel a certain luxurious physical 
well-being, arising from the final safe arrival of 
the old woman and the pig that night. But in the 
exquisite little novella of Beauty and the Beast 
the outcome of the story is not only a settlement 
of the affairs of the persons in whom we are inter- 
ested, but it is also a comment on life of univer- 
sal application—that in a world where things go 
as they should, good, gentle, and pretty persons 
are rewarded with their hearts’ desire, while rude, 
haughty, and cruel persons are either punished 
or left entirely out in the award of good things. 
This sort of ending, conclusive and fortu- 
nate, the children and the primitive story-makers 
always prefer; any other kind of ending must
-P-A-G-E-79
Story 71 
be prepared for and defended. The younger chil- 
dren will not accept tragedies; the older ones 
accept them with difficulty. Death and failure 
are not realizable to them. It may be true, as 
Wordsworth undoubtedly meant us to see in his 
little cottage-girl in “We Are Seven,” that this 
refusal to believe in death is due to some super- 
nal truth of vision which we, their elders, 
seeing only by the light of common day, have lost. 
But we all know that tragedy is sometimes the 
way of life, and often the way of art, being 
ineradicably written in the events of many of the 
world’s great stories. It would be an ethical and 
artistic folly to substitute a fortunate ending in 
these stories—quite as unpardonable in the tragic 
folk tale as in King Lear or in one of the Greek 
tragedies. 
It is well to study with the children occasion- 
ally a tragic tale, to give them that sort of artis- 
tic experience and to secure the exercise of 
the tender sides of sympathy and pity. But 
because they are not provided by their experience 
with reasons for expecting and accepting tragedy 
they should be prepared for the calamity and led 
to justify and accept it—not as a visitation of 
justice, for a true tragedy is never of that kind 
—hbut as a beautiful pathos or grief. To this 
end one would choose his tragic tale among those
-P-A-G-E-80
  72 Literature in the Elementary School 
which have disaster inwoven from the begin- 
ning, so that the class may not have the shock 
of surprise and the feeling of resentment that 
come of an unexpected and avoidable catas- 
trophe. Take for example, the folk-tale of Litile 
Red Riding-Hood, a poor story for a class in 
any form, but poor as a tragedy because there is 
nothing in the events to warn them of the tragic 
end. To be sure there is the treacherous wolf, 
but he is stupid and should by rights be defeated 
and outwitted; it is simply preposterous, in the 
code of childhood, that he should triumph. This 
lack of the inevitable and necessary element in 
the disaster is doubtless what tempted the folk 
themselves to divert it by a dénouement, possibly 
reminiscent of certain mythical stories—the 
recovery of the maiden from the wolf’s stomach, 
which by its improbability and grotesquerie 
tempts the skepticism of the class, however 
young. As an example of the other sort, 
consider the old ballad long ago adopted as a 
nursery tale—The Babes in the Wood, which 
carries in its very nature and in every incident 
the prophecy of tragedy; so that, however 
grievous the calamity may be, it does not 
come upon us with the additional shock of 
surprise and the additional injury of unreason- 
ableness. This kind of story accomplishes the
-P-A-G-E-81
  
Story 73 
result of discharging the tender emotions without 
complicating them too deeply with anger and 
revenge. 
But, on the whole, the stories taught the ele- 
mentary class should be those that end conclu- 
sively and fortunately. This principle not only 
matches and satisfies the child’s taste, but it is in 
entire consonance with the principles of his pro- 
cedure in other things—it grows out of the 
method of affirmation and inclusion, regarding 
elimination and denial as useful in a much later 
period of his education. 
As to the way in which the conclusion is 
brought to pass, there is to the child and to the 
childlike mind, in literature as in life, something 
eminently satisfying in poetic justice. Legal justice 
is cold and formal to them, except indeed in those 
frequent cases in which it is a vehicle of ven- 
geance. Besides, it seems to produce an effect 
really alien to the cause; as in the penalties of 
the sufferers in the Inferno, the inevitableness 
of the effect is obscured by the many complex 
stages that intervene between it and the cause. 
Logical justice—the natural, uninterrupted work- 
ing of the forces and motives to a conclusion, or 
to their absorption into a new combination—is 
both too slow and not striking enough. Besides, 
logical justice, working in its impersonal, undis-  
-P-A-G-E-82
  
  74 Literature in the Elementary School 
criminating way, is too likely to hurt someone 
in the piece whom we love, or to spare somebody 
we hate. In short, your elementary class demands 
poetic justice—demands it strong and desires 
it quick. Now, poetic justice is, on the whole, 
the way of art, until we come practically to the 
realistic art of our own generation. It tends to 
secure completeness and unity. As a matter of 
fact, in practically every short and completed 
story of the kind we choose for children the end 
is precipitated and adjusted by the operation of 
poetic justice. 
One would be blind indeed who was unaware 
of the fact that precisely here lies one of the 
dangers of the training in literature. It is this 
that tends to give the mind that has had too 
large a diet of literature, or to which literature 
has been unwisely administered, a distorted view 
of life, obscuring its vision with sentimentality 
and unreality. To guard against these effects 
we should see to it that the children do not have 
an unduly large amount of literature; and we 
should select those stories in which the operation 
of poetic justice is as little misleading as possible. 
Poetic justice may be, and usually is, an ideal, an 
artistic distribution of rewards and punishments; 
but it need not be a haphazard and lawless dis- 
tribution. There is an artistic flaw in a story in
-P-A-G-E-83
  Story 75 
which the rewards go to a person who has not 
legitimately awakened our sympathies; it is not 
safe to say that the reward should go to him 
who has deserved it, for in some of the most 
acceptable children’s stories sympathy sets aside 
deserving—The Musicians of Bremen, for 
example. We are satisfied with the success of 
the musicians, because, being innocent and perse- 
cuted, they have gained our sympathy, and are 
therefore in the line for reward. But the young- 
est child whom I have tested on this point dis- 
approves the outcome of the folk-tale of “Lazy 
Jack” (Joseph Jacob’s English Fairy Tales), in 
which a noodle whose stupidity has caused a 
king’s daughter, previously dumb, to laugh, and 
so to gain her voice, is rewarded by being mar- 
ried to the restored princess. It is not difficult 
to avoid those stories in which poetic justice is 
perverted justice. 
And then, in the long run, when we have 
studied many stories and fitted the literary 
stories in with history and the observation of life, 
we can counteract any effect of unreality we may 
suspect, by placing the rewards and punishments 
in their proper places and classes—translating 
them, as it were, into terms of experience. The 
fairy-tale may say in effect: “Be good and 
gentle and pretty, and you will marry a prince,” 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  76 = Literature in the Elementary School 
or, “If you are mean and spiteful, you will be 
transformed into a toad;” but it is not so difficult 
to convert these propositions into terms that have 
a reality for the third grade, so that marrying a 
prince and being turned into a toad take their 
places as typical or symbolistic rewards and pun- 
ishments.
-P-A-G-E-85
  CHAPTER V 
THE CHOICE OF STORIES 
As a summary and by way of applying the 
facts, principles, and theories discussed in the 
foregoing chapter, let us try to decide what con- 
stitutes a good story to study with a class of chil- 
dren under thirteen years of age. Not to be 
aware of the critical pitfalls that yawn for one 
who would say what constitutes a good story for 
any purpose, would be entirely too naive; and 
they beset the path of him who would choose a 
fairy-tale quite as thickly as that of the critic of 
mature masterpieces. But many of these pitfalls 
may be avoided if one narrows his path and 
walks circumspectly in it. In the present discus- 
sion the path is narrowed by two considerations. 
First, we will leave out of the discussion mat- 
ters of mere personal taste and instinctive feeling 
—that region in which impressionism and ama- 
teur criticism flourish, confining it as closely as 
may be to those matters that yield to judgment, 
and that are, as nearly as possible, matters of 
fact. There is about every bit of literature a 
sphere in which the individual taste is sole arbiter. 
One man’s meat is here another man’s poison. 
17 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  78 Literature in the Elementary School 
The merest lay reader here makes up his mind: 
“T like it,” “TI like it not;” and there is no appeal 
from these judgments, and no way of modify- 
ing them short of a complete training in criti- 
cism, or a complete remaking of the reader’s 
experience. It is quite true that the region in 
which these differences lie may be greatly reduced 
by a knowledge of a few fundamental critical 
principles, and by a mere suppression of prejudices 
and sentimentalities. But in the last analysis there 
always remains a margin, a border of this every 
man’s territory. If the bit of literature be a 
story, it is likely to be matters of character- 
growth, motives of conduct, interplay of per- 
sonal influence, social, philosophical, and ethi- 
cal interpretation and influence, that lie within 
this region and are subjects of disagreement and 
uncertainty. Here lies, too, that more or less 
elusive, but very real, thing that belongs to every 
bit of literature—what we call “charm.” This 
may be a matter of structure, of style, even of 
vocabulary, of persons, of furniture, of archi- 
tecture or other mere accessories—of geogra- 
phy, of the temperament of the reader, a 
combination of all these or of any number of 
them, or of other things too numerous or too 
elusive to be named. Every good story has it, or 
gets it as soon as a sincere and sympathetic reader
-P-A-G-E-87
  The Choice of Stories 79 
learns how to read it. If one should ever find 
a story which after repeated readings develops 
nothing of this most essential and intangible 
quality of charm, let him not try to teach it. 
Either it is not a good story, or he has no tem- 
perament for art. 
But, however interesting these matters may 
be to readers of the gentle guild, and to the 
impressionist critic, they do not carry us far 
upon our practical educational choice. This must 
be guided by a study of those aspects and ele- 
ments of story which yield to plain observation; 
which, however artistic, are yet amenable to 
judgment, and may therefore be impersonally and 
unemotionally discussed—such as the structure 
of the story, its use of incident, its movement, 
its plot, its outcome, the fitness of the whole for 
the training and best amusement of the children. 
In the second place, we limit and define our 
discussion, if another reminder of this important 
fact may be allowed, by the determination to 
discuss, not the art of literature, not all or any 
literature, not all literature for children, but such 
literature as it may be found expedient and 
desirable to give to a class of children. 
1. In order to get it into the summary, it hav- 
ing been sufficiently amplified in a previous chap- 
ter, and being indeed, self-evident, we will say 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  
80 = Literature in the Elementary School 
again that a story, good to teach in class should 
be one whose material corresponds to the needs 
and tastes of the children. The experiences por- 
trayed should be, not necessarily those that they 
have had, but such as they can conceive and 
imaginatively appropriate, or such as they might 
safely experience. And since children of this 
age are living, or ought to be encouraged to live, 
active, achieving lives, and are not, or ought not 
to be, introspective or too meditative; since they 
know little or nothing of intricate social compli- 
cations or psychic experience, and we do not 
desire that they should, we will choose their liter- 
ature with these things in mind. We may safely 
say that there should be nothing reflected in his 
story which the inquisitive child may not probe 
to the very bottom without coming upon knowl- 
edge too mature for him. This must be recon- 
ciled with the fact that one of the valuable ser- 
vices of literature is to forestall experience and 
to supplement it. The reconciliation is not diffi- 
cult to make when once the teacher has grasped 
the principle of fitness and really walks in the 
light of what he may easily know about the 
nature of children. : 
2. The larger number of their stories should 
be of things happening, of achievement, of epic, 
objective activity. Single children should often  
-P-A-G-E-89
  The Choice of Stories 81 
have a quiet, idyllic story to read. The class 
should occasionally have such a story or poem to 
consider and should be carefully guided .to the 
enjoyment of it. But for the class in the 
larger amount of its work we will choose stories 
of action, as corresponding most nearly to the 
experience and interest of the children, as har- 
monizing most completely with the character of 
their other disciplines, as serving best to create an 
atmosphere of artistic rapport in any group large 
enough to compose a class, while they serve 
equally well with other stories to effect those 
other aspects of literary training which we desire. 
However, all persons who choose and write 
stories for children should suspect themselves 
in regard to this matter of activity. When 
we say that these stories should contain much 
activity and should move forward chiefly by 
the method of adventure, we do not mean that 
there should be unlimited or superfluous activity. 
The two marks of the sensational story are too 
much activity, or merely miscellaneous activity, 
and activities unnecessarily and unnaturally 
heightened and spiced. It is not difficult to test 
our stories on either of these points. A good 
story has a central action to be accomplished, 
toward this many minor activities co-operate; 
there should be enough of these to accomplish
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 Literature in the Elementary School 
the result, but there should be economy of inven- 
tion and skill in arrangement, so that one does 
not feel that there has been a waste of material 
nor a bid for overstimulated interest. The 
danger to the child’s culture, artistic, intel- 
lectual, and moral, of the ordinary juveniles lies 
just here, the heaping-up of sensations, the effort 
to provide a thrill for every page, throws the 
story out of balance, strains the child’s nerves, 
and helps to produce a depraved taste. 
3. To bear the strain of class use the story 
should present a sound and beautiful organiza- 
tion. This plea for a good and trustworthy 
structure should not be mistaken for a plea for a 
formal and artificial use of a story. It is rather 
an appeal for the use of the logical and rational 
side of literature—an urgency that we bring into 
the training of the children the plain and funda- 
mental matters of art-form that the story exhibits, 
at the same time that we get out of it the intel- 
lectual value it has for the class. If it be a short 
story, it should go to its climax by a direct and 
logical path, and close when its effect is produced. 
If it be a longer story, it should have that arrange- 
ment of details and parts that corresponds to the 
movements of the action, and that serves to get 
the material before us in the most effective and 
economical way. 
   
-P-A-G-E-91
  The Choice oj Stories 83 
Stories that are elaborate enough to have a 
genuine plot are desirable for all classes except 
perhaps the very youngest. It is not necessary to 
say again, except by way of an item in the sum- 
mary, that the plot should be simple and easy to 
see through, containing very little of the element 
of suspense, and only a legitimate amount of the 
element of surprise. Some more elaborate plots, 
with more mystification in them, are intel- 
lectually stimulating to the oldest grades, and 
create an interest of curiosity. But all teachers 
should learn to regard this stimulus as a mere 
by-product of literary study, and this curiosity 
as a merely adventitious ally. 
4. Clearly connected with the matter of good 
and sufficient structure is that of economy of 
incident. A story which displays a profusion of 
details may be interesting, and under certain 
circumstances valuable, to a child. But for 
the class that is a better story which uses 
just those incidents essential to the produc- 
tion of its effect. Compare our old friend, Per- 
rault’s Cinderella, in this matter with Grimm’s. 
It needs but two nights at the ball—one 
when the maiden remembers the godmother’s 
injunction, and one when she forgets it. Grimm’s 
version gives us three nights, and fills the story 
with all manner of irrelevant details, which indi-  
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 Literature in the Elementary School 
cate, indeed, the prodigal wealth of the folk- 
mind and the unbounded interest of the folk- 
audience; but they show no superintendence of 
the folk-artist. 
Of course, when one is judging a story from 
this point of view, he must take into account the 
effect to be produced before he pronounces as to 
the sufficiency or superfluity of the incidents. 
There must always be enough to be convincing, 
to give to the story the atmosphere of veri- 
similitude, and to justify and reward our interest 
in the affairs of the persons. In Andersen’s The 
Ugly Duckling he needs to produce the effect of 
lapse of time, the experience of many vicissi- 
tudes, and the repeated refusals of the world to 
receive his genius; every incident then, though 
it may to some extent reproduce a previous one, 
is valuable as contributing to the effect. 
5. As a part of the artistic economy of the 
story, it should have a close unity—closer than 
we would demand of a story read to our children 
at home, and closer than we should demand for 
an adult novel. The threads of the action should 
be so closely related and interlinked that they are 
practically all in action all the time. This is 
particularly true for the younger children. It 
may not be too great a tax upon the patience and 
attention of the older children to leave the hero
-P-A-G-E-93
  The Choice of Stories 35 
in imminent danger on his desert island, while 
we return for several chapters to the heroine in 
the crypts of the wicked duke’s castle; but the 
little ones should not be asked to endure it. 
The action should be all rounded up within 
the one design and stop at the artistic stopping- 
place. To appreciate this aspect of unity, read 
Grimm’s Briar-Rose—that wonderful little mas- 
terpiece of structure—in comparison with Per- 
rault’s The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood, which 
trails after it the ugly and inorganic episode of 
the ogre mother-in-law. Even in the cycles of 
stories the separate episodes should display these 
qualities of unity. 
6. When we choose our standard class-story, 
we will have in mind other aspects of the prin- 
ciple of economy, or of due artistic measure. In 
such a story there should not be an undue appeal 
to any one emotion. Too much horror or dis- 
gust will undo the very effect one desires to pro- 
duce. Such a story as The Dog of Flanders, for 
example, affords a sort of emotional spree of pity 
and pathos through which the steadier members 
of a class refuse to go, and which the more emo- 
tional members do not need. Especially should 
there not be any wmnecessary profusion of 
magic, of supernatural agencies, of daring and 
danger. This brings us to the difficult point of
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 Literature in the Elementary School 
the degree or kind of unlikelihood one may risk 
in such a story. When one is reading to the 
single child, or to a few children, or if one is a 
real dramatic genius, this unlikelihood is not so 
important a matter, because it is not difficult under 
either of those conditions to create an atmosphere 
of artistic faith in which any story “goes.” But 
in a big class, with the ordinary teacher it is diffi- 
cult; some inquisitive or skeptical minds will call 
for proof or detailed statement, and quite destroy 
the rapport demanded for the perfect apprecia- 
tion of the story. In a class I once knew such a 
skeptic, who was indeed a mere scientific realist, 
brought the otherwise enraptured class violently 
to earth during the reading of the passage of 
Odysseus between the whirlpool and the cliff, by 
the sardonic suggestion that Scylla must have 
had a “rubber-neck.” When it can be avoided, 
do not tempt your skeptic or your cynic by the 
kind or degree of unlikelihood liable to excite his 
protest. 
7. The story should be serious. This does not 
preclude humorous and comic stuff. But the 
funny things should be sincerely funny, as con- 
tra-distinguished from those things that are 
ostentatiously childlike, elaborately accomodated 
to the infant mind, ironical, or sentimental, and 
the teacher must so know his story, and so honor
-P-A-G-E-95
  The Choice of Stories 87 
it and his children, that he can render it to them 
whether it be an improbable adventure of Odys- 
seus, or the merest horse-play of a folk-droll, 
sincerely and cordially. 
8. In the earlier typical years of the elemen- 
tary school, through the sixth grade (twelve-year- 
old children) at least, the persons of the story 
should be those who do things rather than those 
who become something else. They should dis- 
play the striking, permanent qualities rather than 
the elusive, evolving qualities; they should act 
from simple and strong motives, not from obscure 
and complex ones. Only in the latest years, if at 
all within the period, should the class be asked to 
consider more intricate types, more subjective 
qualities, and more mixed motives. No mistake is 
likely to be made in this matter, if the stories 
and plays are well chosen from the point of view 
of fitness in other respects. Every teacher who is 
conscientious and informed, will realize that these 
persons in the stories contribute their quota— 
and a very large one—to that “copy,” that ideal 
self, that broods over every child’s inner life, 
inviting him on, giving him courage and hope, 
reproof and praise, leading him to whatever he 
attains of social and personal morality. And every 
such teacher can help the children to build into
-P-A-G-E-96
    88 Literature in the Elementary School 
their ideals the permanent and valuable qualities 
of these persons of their story. 
9. The story should be ethically sound. On 
this point one would like to make discriminating 
statements. One does not teach literature in 
order to teach morals and he cannot ask that 
his fairy-tale should turn out a sermon, or that 
his hero-tale deliberately inculcate this or that 
virtue. Indeed, literature may be completely un- 
moral, and still safely serve the purposes of 
amusement and of distinctively literary training 
—as witness the nursery rhymes, the Garden of 
Verses, Alice in Wonderland. But if it be im- 
moral, it is also artistically unsound, and does not 
yield satisfactory literary results. No teacher is 
in danger of teaching a story which depicts 
the attractions of vice or glorifies some roguish 
hero. But let him beware also of those less 
obvious immoralities, where the success of a 
story turns upon some piece of unjustifiable 
trickery or disobedience, or irreverence, or 
some more serious immorality, which thus has 
placed upon it the weight of approval. In the 
chapbook tale of Jack and the Bean-Stalk, 
to take a chance example, the hero’s successful 
adventures hinge upon a piece of folly and dis- 
obedience; the kindergartenized version of The 
Three Bears excuses an unpardonable breach of
-P-A-G-E-97
  The Choice of Stories 89 
manners. The pivotal issue, the central spring of 
a story must be ethically strong, so as to bear the 
closest inspection and to justify itself in the fierce 
light of class discussion. 
Of course, one should be cautious here, so as 
not to seem merely puritanical or Pecksniffian. 
Subtlety is the savage virtue; along with horse- 
play it is the child’s substitute for both wit and 
humor. The wiles and devices of Odysseus only 
endear him the more to his sympathetic child-fol- 
lowers, as they did to Pallas Athene herself. We 
cannot give to the classes the things best for them 
in other ways, and exclude all tales in which 
wiliness or subtlety constitutes the method, if not 
the motive. But we can do this: we can see to 
it that the trick tends to the securing of final 
justice, and we can discriminate between mere 
deceitful trickiness and that subtlety which is, as 
in the case of Odysseus, quickness of wit or 
steady intellectual dominance. And we must 
make many allowances, setting ourselves free in 
the child’s moral world as it really is to him, by 
constant imaginative sympathy. According to 
the nursery code there is no harm in playing a 
trick upon a giant; by very virtue of being a 
giant, with the advantage of size on his side, and 
more than likely stupid besides, he is fair game 
for any nimble-witted hero. The children and
-P-A-G-E-98
  go = Literature in the Elementary School 
their heroes use the deliciously frank and entirely 
satisfying argument of the fisherman who freed 
the monstrous Afreet from the bottle: “This is 
an Afreet, and I am a man, and Allah has given 
me sound reason. Therefore I will now plot his 
destruction.” The butcher and the hen-wife, he- 
reditary villains of the folk-tales, are such unpitied 
victims. The misfortunes of Kluge Else, of Hans 
in Luck, and of the countless other noodles, are 
but the proper fruit of their folly. Every child will 
instinctively—and indeed ultimately—justify the 
legal quibble by which Portia defeats Shylock, as 
but the just visitation upon his cunningly devised 
cruelty. Let it be a clear case of the biter bitten, 
and of the injustice or stupidity of the original 
biter, and one need not fear the result—certainly 
not the artistic result—upon the sensible child or 
upon the average class—the average class being, 
in the end, always a sensible child. 
At the same time one hastens to say that to 
use a large number of such stories would place 
the children in an atmosphere of trickery and 
petty scheming which would be most undesirable. 
I have read with a group of children where the 
presence of one incurably slippery member so 
poisoned the air that it would have been unwise to 
study even one story in which success was 
achieved by the use of a trick or a bit of subtlety.
-P-A-G-E-99
  The Choice of Stories gi 
Let your stories be ethically sound, even the 
stratagems and wiles making for justice, and the 
right sort of mercy. 
10. It is best, on the whole, that the stories 
given in class have a satisfying and conclusive 
ending of the romantic sort. It should, of course, 
be the ending for which the events have paved 
the way, and the ending which the children, in 
view of the direction in which their sympathies 
have been enlisted, will feel to be just. When a 
tragic ending is inevitable, it should, in the case 
of the younger children, be provided for and 
justified. All things considered, it is better, emo- 
tionally and artistically, for these younger chil- 
dren to consider in class those stories which have 
a fortunate ending, displaying the working of 
poetic justice, leaving for the older groups the 
tragedies, and the logical justice of a convinced 
realism.

  CHAPTER VI 
FOLK-TALE AND FAIRY-STORY 
Whatever may be our attitude toward the cul- 
ture-epoch theory of a child’s training and 
experience, or however much we may vary in our 
conscious or unconscious application of it, no 
observer of children will have failed to notice 
that in the three or four years lying about the 
seventh, they have their characteristic hour of 
social and psychic ripeness for fairy-tales. Upon 
this point the philosophical deductions of the 
technical pedagogues coincide perfectly with the 
intuitive wisdom of all the generations of mothers 
and nurses. The imaginative activity of the six- 
or seven-year-old person coming to school out of 
the environment of the average modern home is 
practically on the same level, and follows the 
same processes, as that of the folk whebproduckd 
the golden core of folk-tales—not _ primitive 
savage fragments of legend, not developed .artis- 
tic romance, but complete little tales, simple and 
sincere, molded into acceptable form by genera- 
tions of use. The vision of the world physical 
and social that these tales present, and their 
interpretation of its activities, is that which is 
92 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  Folk-Tale and Fairy-Story 93 
normal to the seven-year-old child, and consti- 
tutes therefore the natural basis on which his 
literary education begins, and affords his first 
effective contact with imaginative art. 
But when we have agreed that the fairy-tales 
constitute precisely the right artistic material for 
these children; when we have fixed with satis- 
factory definiteness the hour of their ripeness for 
them; when we have indicated those elements in 
the tales that render them serviceable, we are still 
at the beginning of our task. For we find our- 
selves in the presence of a vast mass of material 
from which we must choose those things that are 
so typical as to accomplish for our children the 
characteristic service of folk-tales, and so beauti- 
ful as to perform the added service of good litera- 
ture. And so wide is the range of subject-matter 
and form in the stories constituting the mass that 
it becomes evident at a glance that the educational 
and artistic efficacy of the fairy-tales depends 
upon the wisdom used in choosing the actual 
specimens. The most useful thing to be done, 
then, is to determine a set of trustworthy and 
practical principles of selection. 
We should understand, to begin with, what we 
mean by fairy-tales. It is now impossible to 
limit this term to those stories that deal with the 
activities of an order of invented preter-human 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  94 Literature in the Elementary School 
beings called fairies; or even to those that 
contain preternatural or supernatural elements. 
With the old fairy-tales in this narrow sense, 
have been incorporated folk-tales dealing with 
matter which involves only natural and human 
material—beast-tales and bits of comic adventure, 
for example. It is possible to treat them, how- 
ever, in one category, because of the fact that in 
all those that are worth using for the children in 
class, whether there be fairies involved or not, 
the imaginative process is of the same kind, the 
vision of the world, its activities and its possi- 
bilities, is on the same level of imaginative com- 
bination and artistic interpretation ; and this is the 
level of the children for whom we are choosing. 
The traditionary stories, the real folk-tales, 
have been divided into four classes. 
1. Sagas—stories told of heroes, of historical 
events, of physical phenomena, of the names or 
location of places, and intended to be believed. 
They are to be differentiated from myth by the 
fact that they have never assumed any religious 
or symbolic signification. They are, as a matter 
of fact, hero-tales in the making—of the same 
stuff in many cases as the great hero-tales, but 
having remained in the hands of the folk, have 
never received the enrichment and beauty of those 
hero-tales which the poets took up. Such folk- | 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  Folk-Tale and Fairy-Story 95 
sagas are Whittington and His Cat and Lady 
Godiva. Most of these stories have preter- 
natural or supernatural elements, and even such 
as have no such elements have still the atmos- 
phere of wonder, and those fanciful or fantastic 
interpretations characteristic of the folk-imagi- 
nation. 
2. Marchen, or what we call “nursery tales”— 
those told for artistic pleasure, pure imaginative 
play, the creative exercise of the art-instinct. 
They may or may not exhibit the supernatural 
or preternatural elements; in some of them ani- 
mals are among the actors. These constitute 
the large mass of popular and nursery tales; Cin- 
derella, Beauty and the Beast, Puss in Boots, 
Briar-Rose, The Musicians of Bremen will do 
for examples. 
3. Drolls—comic or domestic tales which 
may or may not make use of the impossible, the 
marvelous, or the preternatural. Generally they 
are tales of funny misadventures, cunning horse- 
play, tricks, the misfortunes or undeserved 
good luck of “noodles.” Such, chosen from 
many examples, are Kluge Else, Lazy Jack, Mr. 
Vinegar, Hans in Luck. 
4. Cumulative tales—those in which incident 
is inter-linked with incident by some more or less 
artificial principle of association, constituting in
-P-A-G-E-104
  96 = Literature in the Elementary School 
some cases a mere string of associated happen- 
ings, in others a fairly rounded out story. Such, 
in its simplest form, are The House That Jack 
Built, Titty-mouse and Tatty-mouse, Henny-penny, 
and the old swapping ballads. 
The modern stories corresponding to these are 
of three kinds: those written in imitation of the 
folk-sagas and Mdrchen; those which introduce 
preter-human elements as symbols; those which 
personify the phenomena and forces of nature. 
It is not mere convention that leads one to 
choose for the children in class the traditionary 
or folk-tales in preference to the modern fairy- 
story. Many new so-called fairy-tales are doubt- 
less harmless and amusing enough, and may serve 
a purpose in hours of mere recreation. But they 
lack those abiding qualities one seeks in a story he 
gives as discipline and to a class. Failing to 
possess the very fundamental characteristics of 
the folk-tale, they fail to perform the typical and 
desirable service of the folk-tale. First of all, 
modern fairy-tales are neither convinced nor con- 
vincing ; they are imitations, which cannot fail to 
miss the soul of the original. There can be no new 
fairy-tales written, because there is no longer a 
possibility of belief in fairies, and no longer 
among adults a possibility of looking at the world 
as the folk and the child look at it. The substitu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  
Folk-Tale and Fairy-Story 97 
tion of the pert fairies and dapper elves of litera- 
ture and the theater for the serious preterhuman 
agents of the folk-tale creates at once in the new 
stories an atmosphere of dilettantism, of insin- 
cerity. Titania and Oberon, flower-fairies, dew- 
fairies, gauzy wings and spangled skirts, were not 
in the mind of the people who told these tales of 
the sometimes grim and schauderhaft and always 
serious beings—fairies, elves, goblins, or what 
not. Wicked little brown men disappearing into a 
green hillock with the human child, in exchange 
for whom they have left in the cottage cradle a 
brown imp of their own; the godmother with 
the fairy-gift who brings justice and joy to the 
wronged maiden; the slighted wise woman fore- 
telling death and doom over the cradle of the 
little princess; the kind and gentle Beast whom 
love disenchants and restores to his own noble 
form—all these were to those who made them 
serious art, as they should be to the child. If one 
could make the old distinction without dreading 
to be misunderstood in these days of opposition to 
“faculty” criticism, he would say that the 
folk-tales exhibit the working of the deep human 
imagination, using all the powers of the mind, 
and reorganizing the world; the modern fairy- 
tale exhibits the exercise of the fancy, disporting 
itself in a very small corner of the world of art. 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 Literature in the Elementary School 
It is, first of all, as one cannot say too often, 
the imaginative level of the folk-tales that fits 
them for the child’s use. They are the creative 
reconstruction of the world by those who were 
rich in images and sense-material, unhampered in 
the use of it by any system of logic or body of 
organized knowledge, simple, sincere and full 
of faith—as our own well-born children are at 
six-seven-eight. It is this simplicity, sincerity, 
and earnestness that gives them their childlike- 
ness—all qualities that one fails to find in the 
modern fairy-tale written by a grown person 
for children. Nothing is so alien to the 
consciousness of the child as the consciousness 
of the grown-up educated man. It is by noth- 
ing short of a miracle that he can keep his own 
sophistications out of what he writes for chil- 
dren. His fairy-tale, failing in simplicity, will 
betake itself to babbling inanity ; failing in earnest- 
ness, it gives itself over to sentimentality ; failing 
in belief, it is likely to be filled with cynicism 
and cheap satire under the guise of playfulness. 
These faults may be found, all too plentiful, even 
in the best work of Hans Christian Andersen, 
while they poison practically everything done for 
children by Kingsley and Hawthorne. The im- 
mense advantage of the traditionary tales is that 
they were not made for children. The Marchen
-P-A-G-E-107
  Folk-Tale and Fairy-Story 99 
of our day was the novel or romance of the 
people among whom it had its earlier history. It 
therefore escapes entirely the “little dears” appeal 
and method. The obviously amateur heat- 
fairies, snow-fairies, flower-fairies, and all the 
others which figure in the merely fanciful and 
always misleading myth-making of the belated 
kindergarten and the holiday book of commerce, 
serve chiefly to bewilder the child’s judgment, 
to confuse his imagination, and to cheapen the 
supernatural in his art, which should be sparing 
and serious, as it should be in all art. Besides, 
the natural phenomena with which these fancies 
are connected are much more beautiful, more 
appealing to the imagination, and ultimately more 
serviceable to art, if they are rightly presented as 
plain nature. 
There are certain modern symbolistic stories 
containing elements of the fantastic and super- 
natural kind that are good and beautiful enough 
to make a genuinely desirable contribution to the 
child’s experience. It is advisable to reserve these, 
however, until the children are old enough and 
experienced enough to understand them as sym- 
bols. Such stories are Stockton’s The Bee-Man 
of Orn, slightly edited; The Water Babies, 
always expurgated of Kingsley’s ponderous fool- 
ing; The Snow Image, The Ugly Duckling.

It is not only that the world of imaginary 
beings and marvelous forces in the folk-tale en- 
chant the child and further his artistic develop- 
ment in the most natural way; the human world 
of these tales is a delightful and wholesome one 
for him to know. It is a naive and simple world, 
where he may come close to the actual processes 
of life and see them as picturesque and interest- 
ing. Where else in our modern world can a 
child encounter the shoemaker, the tailor, the 
miller, the hen-wife, the weaver, the spinner, in 
their primitive dignity and importance? There 
are kings, to be sure, and princes, but except in 
certain of the stories that took permanent literary 
shape in the seventeenth century, they are, like 
the kings and princes in the Odyssey, plain and 
democratic monarchs, on terms of beautiful 
equality with the noble swineherd and the charm- 
ing tailor. King Arthur in the nursery ballad 
stole a peck of barley meal to make a bag-pud- 
ding, in the homeliest and most democratic way, 
and the picture of the queen frying the cold pud- 
ding for breakfast seems only natural to the little 
democrats of six and seven in our own day. This 
world of genuine people and honest occupations 
is charming and educative in itself, and consti- 
tutes the most effective and convincing back-
-P-A-G-E-109
  
Folk-Tale and Fairy-Story 101 
ground for the supernatural and the marvelous 
when that element is present. 
When we have said that it is the folk or 
traditionary tales that we should choose, we do 
not mean that we should consider the whole 
realm of folk-lore material, primitive and savage 
tales—African, Indian, Igorrote; though, as a 
matter of fact, every teacher of children should be 
something of a scientific student of folk-stories. 
It increases his respect and sympathy for the 
specimens he actually chooses to know where they 
stand in the large whole—their history and human 
value. Besides, the experienced teacher will often 
find in the outlying regions of folk-tales the germ 
of a story precisely suited to his needs, and he 
can have the very real pleasure of endowing it 
with an acceptable form and putting it into edu- 
cational circulation. 
But on the whole, the teacher must be very 
expert, and must have extraordinary needs, to 
feel justified in going outside the established 
canon of fairy-tales for his material. For there 
is a canon more or less fixed, into which have 
entered those stories that have from long and 
perpetual use taken on a more or less acceptable 
form; stories from those nations whose culture 
has blended to produce the modern occidental 
tradition. The canon includes Grimm’s tales, 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  1o2 Literature in the Elementary School 
Perrault’s Mother Goose tales, a few of Madame 
d’Aulnoy’s, a few Danish and Norwegian stories, 
some from Italian sources and through Italian 
media, some from the Arabian Nights, some 
unhesitatingly admitted lately from collections 
of English. folk-tales made in our own day, 
two or three chapbook stories, a few inter- 
lopers like The Three Bears, Goody Two 
Shoes, and some of Andersen’s—not popu- 
lar tales at all, but having in them some myste- 
rious charm that opened the door to them. One 
cannot attempt to fix the limits more narrowly, 
for he has no sooner closed the list than he real- 
izes that every teacher who has used them, every 
mother who has read them to her little people, © 
every boy or girl who loves them, will have some 
other tale to insert, some perfect thing not pro- 
vided for in this tentative catalogue. Besides, 
from time to time there does appear-a new claim- 
ant with every title to admission, such as some of 
the Irish tales told by Seumas McManus or 
Douglas Hyde, or certain of the Zufii folk- 
tales collected by Cushing. But on the whole. 
may we not agree that the list indicated consti- 
tutes the authentic accepted canon of fairy-tales 
established and approved by the teachers and 
children of occidental tradition and rearing? 
Still, there are choices to be made among these 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  Folk-Tale and Fairy-Story 103 
folk-tales of the accepted list. No child should be 
told all of them. Practically all children do have 
too many fairy-tales told them, and suffer in 
this, as in most of the things supplied them, from 
the discouraging and confusing “too much.” For 
a whole year in which the main stories are taken 
from the folk-tales, a half-dozen stories will be 
enough. 
It is not among the folk-sagas that one will 
find the best stories of this kind for his children. 
These, indeed, are scarcely to be called literature. 
Most of them are tales explaining by a legend 
some natural feature, the name of a place or a 
person, or attaching to some historic person a 
stock adventure, wonderful or preternatural. 
Some of them are, as has been said, germs of 
hero-tales that never obtained popular artistic 
favor, or they are far-away echoes of hero-tales, 
or they are stories of the pourquoi kind—semi- 
mythical in import, and consequently lacking the 
universal appeal and fitness of literature. Any 
teacher may find one of the stories of this group 
adapted to his purpose, but he will not find most 
of his folk-material here. In the cycles of hero 
tales, King Arthur and Siegfried for example, 
we can find many of these minor sagas imbedded 
in the larger cycle, but still detachable and often 
easily adaptable for the younger children. 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 Literature in the Elementary School 
It is among the Mdrchen that we find our 
supply of stories. This is not the place to dis- 
cuss the science of nursery-tales, their origin, 
genesis, dissemination, or any of the other 
scholar’s aspects, inviting though all these topics 
be. One is quite aware that even in the most 
social Marchen there may be found detritus of 
myth; one should be equally aware that in cer- 
tain other Marchen he finds the original germ 
which finally evolved into a myth-story. But 
let not the teacher and lover of folk-tales as art 
allow himself to become ensnared in myth inter- 
pretations of his tales; that way literary and 
pedagogic madness lies. Countless generations 
ago those which perchance had a mythical signifi- 
cance lost it and became art, completely human- 
ized in life and experience. 
The drolls, when one chooses well among 
them, are precisely adapted to add the element of 
fun that should never be long absent from the chil- 
dren’s literature. There are, of course, number- 
less comic folk-tales too coarse and too brutal to 
be used in our day, except by the scientific stu- 
dent of culture. The fun of the drolls is, as a 
matter of fact, not on a high level—practical jokes, 
perfectly obvious contretemps, the adventures and 
achievements of noodles, are their typical ma- 
terial. But this is the comic level of the average 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
Folk-Tale and Fairy-Story 105 
child for whom we choose them. It is the first 
step above physical fun, and from this step we 
can undertake to start him on his delightful jour- 
ney up the ever-refining path of literary comedy. 
From tricks and horse-play he may pass rapidly 
to humor and nonsense. But at six-seven, hav- 
ing had the Little Guinea Pig and Simple Simonas 
an undergraduate kinder, he is ready for Hans 
in Luck and Mr. Miacca. Like the Olympians 
themselves, he will roar at Hephaestus’ limp, and 
with the council of Homeric heroes he will laugh 
at the physical chastisement of Thersites, and 
enjoy the none-too-penetrating trick that Odys- 
seus played upon the blundering Polyphemus. 
There is no danger that the children will not out- 
grow this stage of comic appreciation—the 
danger is that they will outgrow it instead of add- 
ing to it all the other stages. There is something 
wrong with the artistic culture of the man who 
cannot at forty smile at the follies of the Peterkin 
family, at the same time that he completely savors 
the comedy of The Egoist. 
The accumulative tales have their service tc 
render. Perhaps their characteristic moment 
comes a little earlier than even the first year of 
school. Before he is six the little citizen of the 
world will have been building up his vision of 
the interdependence and interaction of men and 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
106 Literature in the Elementary School 
things. To this vision the accumulative tales 
bring the contribution of art. Many of them, 
being the simplest adjustment of incident to inci- 
dent, such as The Old Woman Who Found the 
Sixpence and The Little Red Hen, are ideal for 
the nursery and kindergarten child. Others 
still, built upon the accumulative principle, but 
more complex or more artistic in form, will 
charm and instruct the first-year scholars— 
Henny-Penny, for example, and Hans in Luck, 
and The Three Billy-goats Gruff. From the point 
of view of composition, they may well be studied 
by the older children, because they permit the 
examination of the separate incidents, and exhibit 
in most cases the very simplest principles of 
structure. 
But coming still closer to the choosing of the 
actual specimens for the classes, it would be only 
fatuous to ignore the fact that when we come 
to the matter of the final choice, we are upon 
difficult ground, educationally and critically. 
But we can save ourselves from presumption 
and dogmatism by discussing a few practical, but 
general, grounds of choice, reminding ourselves 
that in the specific school and with the specific 
class many modifying minor principles will arise. 
The teacher will be much comforted and 
steadied if he remember that he is teaching litera-
-P-A-G-E-115
  Folk-Tale and Fairy-Story 107 
ture, and is therefore freed from any obligation 
to the stories as myth, or as scientific folk-lore, as 
sociology or as nature-study; let nothing tempt 
him to the study of the first member of the com- 
pany of musicians of Bremen, as “‘a type of the 
solid-hoofed animals,” of Red Riding-Hood as a 
“dawn-myth,” or of The Three Bears as “parent- 
hood in the wild.” 
The teacher will select those tales that have 
somewhere in their history acquired an artistic 
organization, rejecting in favor of them those 
which remain chaotic and disorganized. Com- 
pare, for example, in this matter, the perfect little 
plot of Madame de Beaumont’s Beauty and the 
Beast with Grimm’s The Golden Bird—a string 
of loosely connected, partly irrelevant incidents. 
He will prefer those that display economy of 
incident—in which each incident helps along the 
action, or contributes something essential to the 
situation. Of course, it is rather characteristic 
of the folk mind, as of the child mind, to heap 
up incidents 4 propos de bottes; but as this is one 
of the characteristics to be corrected in the child 
by his training in literature, so it is one of the 
faults which should exclude a fairy-tale from his 
curriculum. To make the difference among the 
stories in this regard quite clear, compare the 
neat, orderly, and essential flow of incident in 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  108 Literature in the Elementary School 
The Musicians of Bremen with the baffling mul- 
tiplicity and confusion displayed by Madame 
d’Aulnoy’s The Wonderful Sheep. Other things 
being equal, he will prefer for discipline those 
fairy-stories which use the fairy and other pre- 
ternatural elements in artistic moderation, to 
those that fill every incident with marvels and in- 
troduce supernatural machinery apparently out of 
mere exuberance. This element is much more 
impressive when used in art with reticence and 
economy. Even a little child grows too familiar 
with marvels when these crowd one another on 
every page, and ceases either to shiver or to thrill. 
In the fairy-tale, as in art for mature people, the 
supernatural should appear only at the ultimate 
moment, or for the ultimate purpose, and then 
in amount and potency only sufficient to accom- 
plish the result. Perrault was very cautious upon 
this point; in all his tales he seems to have re- 
duced the element of the marvelous to the small- 
est amount and to have called upon it only at the 
pivotal points. Compare in his Cinderella the 
sufficiency of his single proviso, “Now, this 
godmother was a fairy,” with the tedious 
superfluity of irrelevant marvels in Grimm’s 
version of the same tale. Is this bring- 
ing the fascinating abundance of the Teutonic 
folk fancy to a disadvantageous comparison with 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
Folk-Tale and Fairy-Story 109 
the neat and orderly, but more common-place, 
Gallic mind? By no means. One has many occa- 
sions to regret, when he reads Perrault’s version 
of the wonderful tales he found, that he was a 
precisian in style and a courtier in manners; and 
we may find in the most apparently artless tales 
told by Grimm or by Asbjérnsen the most per- 
fect organization and economy; as, for example 
in Briar-Rose or in The Three Billy-goats Gruff. 
Besides, one hastens to add that every child 
should hear and should later on have a chance 
to read some of the free, wandering, fantastic 
things which his teacher cannot feel justified in 
giving to the class. 
One is obliged to take some attitude in medi- 
ating the folk-tales to the modern child, toward 
the fact that we often find them reflecting a moral 
standard quite different from that which the aver- 
age well-bred child is brought up by; and this 
situation is complicated by the fact that the chil- 
dren are too young to understand dramatically 
another moral standard. This aspect of the 
stories has been pretty well covered by the gen- 
eral discussion in the previous chapter. But, 
luckily, it is quite possible to reject all those folk- 
tales of questionable morals and objectionable 
taste and still have plenty to choose from. Be 
slow to reject a folk-tale unless the bit of immor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
110 Literature in the Elementary School 
ality—a lie, an act of disloyalty, or irreverence— 
or the bit of coarseness really forms the pivot of 
the story. Only then is the story unsafe or 
incurable. 
One must take an attitude, not only toward 
the morals of the folk-tale, but toward its man- 
ners as well. There is some violence in many of 
the most attractive nursery tales; many of them 
reflect a rather rough-and-tumble state of social 
communion ; many exhibit a superfluity of blood- 
shed or other grisly physical horrors. We quickly 
grant that it is not wise to read enough of these, 
or to linger long enough over the forbidding 
details, to create a deep or an abiding atmosphere 
of terror. But it is certainly true that the modern 
child of six or seven has so little apperception 
material for physical horrors that they do not 
take any deep hold upon him. Indeed, the safety 
of modern life, and the absence of visible vio- 
lence, have taken the emotional appeal out of 
many grim lessons of Spenser’s and of Dante’s. 
Murder in the Marchen is to the modern child 
actually a bit of fine art—merely a neat and con- 
vincing way of disposing of iniquitous elder 
brothers and hostile magicians. The fact that 
the child’s experience and information enable him 
to make no image of the physiological sequelae 
of the cutting-off of heads, for instance, makes 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  
Folk-Tale and Fairy-Story III 
it easy for the teacher to carry him harmless 
past details that would seem brutal to his nerv- 
ous and squeamish elders. And these details 
are never the point of emphasis in any good story. 
And on the whole, those persons whom the chil- 
dren like and are likely to incorporate into their 
“pattern,” have manners either just or gentle 
even in the folk-tales. 
It might be well to introduce among the folk- 
tales an occasional short story of contemporary 
life, recording the activities of persons such as 
the children actually know. This is not so im- 
portant in this stage of their experience as it will 
be later; first because the folk-tales do not seem 
antiquated nor, if they are wisely selected, unduly 
fantastic to them, since they find themselves 
imaginatively so much at home with material and 
the method; and, in the second place, because 
in every well-regulated school their fact studies 
and occupation work are at this time concrete 
and charming, and keep them rightly and 
sufficiently in touch with the world of actuality. 
Of course we must accompany and supple- 
ment the folk-tales by verses, since even at this 
age we may impress upon the children the music 
of speech, and some of the minor literary 
beauties. They will probably be delighted to 
repeat (in many classes many of the children will 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  112 Literature in the Elementary School 
be learning them for the first time) the lovely 
hereditary jingles and ballads from Mother 
Goose—‘‘The Crooked Man,” “I Saw a Ship a- 
Sailing,” “Sing a Song of Sixpence,” the rhymes 
for games and for counting-out. There are 
a very few of Stevenson’s simple enough for this 
period; and there may be a further choice among 
things found here and there, simple, objective, 
and perfectly musical. It is not so much the con- 
tent and meaning of poetry that we can hope to 
impress upon little people under eight, as the 
music and motion of the verse. There will be, 
however, many members of every class who will 
be interested in the meaning, the images, and 
the persons, if there be persons. We will take 
all pains, therefore, to see that these be not un- 
suitable. 
These—folk-tales and simple singing lyrics— 
with a fable or two told as anecdotes, and re- 
peated until even the little children begin to see 
that there is something more than meets the eye 
—all graded and modified in the light of the 
personnel and experience of the actual class, may 
constitute the literature of the first two years of 
school.

CHAPTER VII 
MYTH AS LITERATURE 
The presupposition that myth is par excel- 
lence the literary material for young children 
doubtless grew out of a misinterpretation of 
the so-called mythopoeic age in the children, and 
some fundamental misconception of the nature of 
myth and its relation to other folk and tradition- 
ary material. There is no place in this little book 
even to suggest the problems that surround the 
nature and genesis of myth. But it does seem 
desirable to make in a simple way a few distinc- 
tions that may serve to set us on the right road. 
First of all, myth is religion, and not art. It 
is not a thing of mere imagination. It is the 
explanation or interpretation of some physical 
fact, some historical occurrence, some social cus- 
‘tom, some racial characteristic, some established 
ritual or worship. It is the religious or emotional 
response to some influence or activity in the world 
so impressive or so efficacious as to seem to call 
for explanation in terms of supernatural agencies. 
This explanatory or interpretative stage or 
aspect of myth may be first historically, or it may 
not be. It is probably first in most myths in a 
113
-P-A-G-E-122
  114 Literature in the Elementary School 
simple and crude form, which in all developed 
myths has been enriched and modified by 
influences from the other stages and aspects. 
The second stage—or shall we call it merely 
another aspect—is the assigning of distinct per- 
sonality and individuality to the agencies assumed 
to account for events and appearances. Then 
follows rapidly the interrelations and inter- 
actions of these persons, the surrounding of them 
with friends and subordinates, the building-up of 
a whole intricate society of divinities after the 
model of human society—all at first symbolistic 
and of religious significance. A third stage or 
aspect is that of the cult, the worship, the estab 
lishment of a priesthood delivering authoritative 
messages, mediating influences to the people, and 
adding constantly to the body of explanations 
and interpretations surrounding each divinity. 
The fourth stage or aspect is that in which it 
becomes, or becomes identified with, a body of 
moral doctrines or ethical principles; where the 
personal divinities, with their qualities, insig- 
nia, and associations, are taken as symbols of 
inner human forces, of moral and social achieve- 
ment, as expressions of spiritual influences oper- 
ant in human nature and life. 
Let it be understood that in naming these 
stages or aspects there has been no attempt to
-P-A-G-E-123
  
  Myth as Literature II5 
place them either in chronological or in logical 
order, and no intention of saying that they stand 
apart from one another in an easily recognized 
distinctness. But, however interlinked and mutu- 
ally modified they may be, we must in any dis- 
cussion of myth, be aware of these four sides or 
steps. 
Take, for example, the Greek myth of Apollo. 
As an explanation of physical phenomena he is 
light or fire, sometimes specialized as the spirit of 
the sun. But he is embodied and endowed with a 
personality; he has social conditions and sub- 
sidiary functions assigned to him. As a person 
he is the son of Zeus and Leto, twin brother of 
Artemis, leader of the nine Muses, guardian of 
pastured flocks and herds, as Artemis of the wild 
creatures who feed or frolic by night. As his 
worship spread and deepened, there gathered 
about him many other functions—he was the god 
of healing, of music, of law, of atonement; and 
many tributary and subordinate divinities were 
associated with him in all these activities. There 
gathered into his myth also an enormous and 
complex body of stories, romantic and mystical, 
explanatory and prophetic—stories of adventure, 
of contact with the other gods, of sojourns with 
men, of pilgrimages to unknown regions; some 
of them merely romantic, some of them symbol-
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 Literature in the Elementary School 
istic, many of them profoundly significant of his 
powers and offices. 
And the myth of Apollo is remarkable for its 
ancient and elaborate worship. Already when the 
Homeric poems were made, the shrine of Apollo 
at Delphos was the scene of an old and compli- 
cated ritual. There was even then a temple rich 
with the accumulated treasure of the votive offer- 
ings of generations of worshipers. Priests and 
prophets, the mystic offices of the Pythia, poets 
and musicians, stately processions of kings and 
warriors seeking oracles, combined to maintain 
the dignity and sanctity of this most impressive 
worship. 
From the very earliest times of which we 
have record of this myth, Apollo was known 
to be a spiritual and ethical force at work in 
man’s soul. He was named when men tried to 
speak of those experiences which wrought expia- 
tion and purification. He stood for milder law, 
for beneficent and benevolent social order, for 
art, for the songs of the sacred bard, the dirge of 
grief, the paean of victory, the games—all the 
gentler things of social culture and personal ex- 
perience. 
In these and in many other ways did the myth 
of Apollo express the human soul and act upon 
it. It was a religion—as every developed myth 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
Myth as Literature 117 
is—to be handled reverently. We might have 
chosen other examples quite as elaborate and as 
full of mystic significance—the myth of Diony- 
sus, or the more widespread and deeply devo- 
tional myth of Demeter. 
Art, too, concerned as it is with everything 
that promotes or reflects man’s spirit, has uses 
for the elements of myth, and has its own way of 
handling them. On two of the four steps of 
myth art, especially literature, finds acceptable 
material. On the stage named second—the stage 
in which the influence or power becomes person- 
ified, takes on relations to other personified influ- 
ences, and calls into being other divine persons, 
his children, his helpers and subordinates, takes 
his place in a society of divinities, and exercises 
his more or less specialized function in this 
society, and also in human life and activity— 
have the poets and romancers found many oppor- 
tunities. Adventures and romantic experiences 
of all sorts easily attached themselves to the per- 
son of some divinity, especially as the character 
of the personal divinities became more and more 
humanized by the accretion of such tales. And 
while we find echoes of myth in Marchen and 
romance, we quite as constantly find apotheosis 
of merely human romance and adventure in myth. 
Among the literary peoples, poets and dramatists 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
    118 Literature in the Elementary School 
found it often desirable to use the foundation 
of this group of divine personalities as the start- 
ing-point for a performance purely artistic; it 
gave them the immense advantage of starting 
without explanation and preparation, since their 
audiences could be counted upon to know the 
divine personages and circumstances; and the 
further advantage of adding dignity and size to 
their inventions by accrediting them to super- 
human agents. These literary additions, these 
variations upon the religious meanings, invented 
for artistic purposes, often gradually incorpo- 
rated themselves into the myth, and by modern 
students are not carefully distinguished from the 
other, the religious and devotional elements. A 
comic adventure told of Hermes may not have in 
it any more of myth than a similar story told of 
Autolycus. 
Literature finds much use for material of the 
mythical kind on what we have called the fourth 
step. To express and render concrete, impulses, 
influences, and powers that sway and dignify 
human conduct, and that form and ennoble human 
character, the literary artist gladly employs the 
persons of the great myths. All human experi- 
ence has elements and influences coming into it 
from an apparently mystic sphere, that must 
either be described in abstract terms or embodied
-P-A-G-E-127
  Myth as Literature 11g 
in concrete persons and symbols. The latter is 
ever the method of art. So we find everywhere 
in literature the use of the great symbols already 
constituted in myth, or the invention of new 
symbols for the purpose. Homer would convey 
to us the sense of the presence that guided and 
guarded the wise and resourceful Odysseus; so 
the stately Athene, ages long the goddess “who 
giveth skill in fair works, and noble minds,” 
comes and goes through the poem. Hauptmann 
would convey to us in The Sunken Bell, some 
impression of the magic and the charm of that 
beauty which lies in the free soul and wild nature, 
so he invents Rautendelein. But neither Homer 
nor Hauptmann is priest or devotee interpreting 
facts or conserving worship. They are artists 
picturing human life and introducing, each in its 
place, the various elements of human experience. 
It is in regard to this literary use of myth that 
there exists much confusion, and that most mis- 
takes are made as to the educational use of myth. 
Many persons who contend that “myths” can be 
given to children as literature call the Iliad and 
the Odyssey “myths;” indeed, they are likely to 
call all legendary stories in which the super- 
natural element is large “myths;” and they call 
all romantic stories that have become attached to 
any divinity “myths.”
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 Literature in the Elementary School 
We should distinguish myth from saga, from 
legend, from merely fanciful symbolistic tales, 
from tales of human heroes. The Homeric 
poems make much of the religious side of human 
nature, and the poet chose in order to give to his 
action and issue a superhuman dignity to set that 
action in the presence of the gods themselves. 
Yea, in the climaxes of the Titanic struggle the 
Powers themselves take a hand, so deeply does 
the poet feel that everything noblest and most 
passionate in human nature is involved; and, 
despairing, as it were, of conveying to us in 
merely human terms the implications of the strife 
between the two kinds of ideals, he sets Aphro- 
dite over against Athene, not merely Trojan 
against Greek. But the Jliad is, for all that, not 
myth nor a collection of myths, but the story 
of the wrath of Achilles—a very human hero, 
who loved his friend. The story of Baldur is 
myth—explaining and interpreting, personifying 
and glorifying, a superhuman influence and effect 
beyond the reach of human experience; the story 
of Siegfried is a saga, a human experience, 
under whatever enlarged and idealized con- 
ditions, yet still a type-experience of the human 
being. The garden of Eden is myth-interpreta- 
tion and explanation of many, some the grimmest, 
facts of man’s nature, and his relation to a super-
-P-A-G-E-129
  Myth as Literature 121 
natural power; the story of Abraham is a saga— 
a typical history of human experience, a typical 
picture of human culture. The whole artistic 
purpose and effect of the hero-tale and the saga 
are different from those of myth; the center of 
interest is a human being; the emphasis is upon 
human life; the meaning is upon the surface. In 
true myth the purpose is not artistic, but religious; 
the emphasis is upon superhuman activities; the 
meaning is buried beneath symbols—the more 
beautiful the myth, the more difficult and com- 
plex the symbol. 
So one has almost to smile at the statement, 
commonly made that myth, implying all myth, 
is childlike, and should therefore be given to little 
children as literature, especially while they them- 
selves are in the mythopoeic age—presumably 
from four to seven. There are so many fallacies 
in this statement that one pauses embarrassed at 
his many opportunities of attack. 
First as to the childlikeness of myth. There 
are, of course, undeveloped races that have a 
naive and childish myth, but it is also so crude 
and unbeautiful that it would never commend 
itself to one seeking artistic material for children. 
The developed myths, those that have achieved 
the elaboration of beautiful episodes, are most 
unchildlike. They are far, far away from the
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 Literature in the Elementary School 
crude guesses of the primitive mind. They have 
all been worked over, codified, filled with theo- 
logical and symbolistic content by priests and 
poets. One can be very sure that no sensible 
teacher who has mastered the material, would 
attempt to teach the whole of any Hebrew or 
Greek or Scandinavian myth as myth within the 
elementary period. If he takes one of the espe- 
cially romantic or beautiful episodes out of the 
myth, he is obliged to thin it out to the compre- 
hension of the children, and to mutilate it so as 
to make of it a mere tale. When one reads Haw- 
thorne’s version of Pandora and Prometheus 
and realizes the mere babble, the flippant detail, 
under which he has covered up the grim Titanic 
story of the yearnings and strivings of the human 
soul for salvation here and hereafter, the very 
deepest problems of temptation and sin, of rebel- 
lion and expiation, he must see clearly what is 
most likely to happen when a complex and 
mature myth is converted into a child’s tale. To 
make a real test, leave the alien Greek myth and 
try the same process with one that we have built 
into our own religious consciousness—the tempta- 
tion and fall in the Garden of Eden; a story, 
which is, by the way, much more naive in concep- 
tion and detail than that of Prometheus. We must 
conclude that such myths are not childlike, and
-P-A-G-E-131
ee ee ee 
| Myth as Literature 123 
that to make such a version of them as will are 
to the little child’s attention and feeling gives but a 
shallow and distorted view of them. 
There should undoubtedly be a place in edu- 
cation for the study of myth as religion and as 
an influence in human culture; should it not be 
somewhere well within the adolescent period, 
when the symbols of the great myths attract and 
do not baffle the child, when their religious content 
finds a congenial lodging-place and a sympathetic 
interpretation in his own experiences? It would 
seem only fair to reserve the beautiful and rever- 
ential myths of the Greeks, Romans, and Scan- 
dinavians for this period, rather than to use them 
in the age when there is little more to appeal to 
than the tendency, so short-lived and shallow- 
rooted in the modern child, to see personal 
agencies behind appearances. For this, confused 
with a degree of grammatical uncertainty of 
speech, is practically all that we can find under 
close analysis, of the mythopoeic faculty in little 
children brought up under modern conditions. 
There are still those, one discovers, who con- 
tend that myth should be given to children as 
literature, because later in life—when they come 
to read the Aeneid in High School, or Paradise 
Lost in college, or Prometheus Unbound or even 
Macaulay’s essays—they will come upon refer-  
-P-A-G-E-132
  124 Literature in the Elementary School 
ences to Zeus, to the fall of Troy, to the Titans, 
to Isis and Osiris, and they ought to be able to 
call up from what they had as literature in the 
elementary school such information as would 
enable them to understand these allusions and fill 
out these references. Luckily, the number of 
people who hold the fundamental theory of edu- 
cation adumbrated in this view is becoming so 
rapidly smaller that this chapter will, let us hope, 
be too late to reach them. The multiplication 
table is a tool; the mechanics of reading and writ- 
ing are partially mere tools; but mythology, es- 
pecially mythology substituted for literature, can 
in no sense be regarded or treated as a tool. 
Occasionally one meets the statement that 
myth, and mythical episodes, are more imagina- 
tive than stories of human life, and should there- 
fore be given to little children as literature. So 
far as the persons who hold this view can be 
pushed to definite terms, they mean either that 
the conditions of ordinary human life are com- 
pletely abrogated in mythical stories, and that 
therefore they are more imaginative than stories 
of mere human experience could be; or that the 
details given by the imagination are arranged in 
some more unusual way—that there is less of 
judgment and order in the arrangement than in 
stories of men and their affairs.
-P-A-G-E-133
  Myth as Literature 125 
Of course, we realize that the human mind 
cannot invent ultimate details independent of 
experience. It is in the number and arrangement 
of these details that originality inheres—that the 
varying quality or quantity of imagination lies. 
Now, it is true that in mythical stories the images, 
the details, are likely to be more numerous, and 
to be arranged in a less orderly manner than in 
an art story; this is of the nature of myth. 
Ruskin, in The Queen of the Air, makes so 
clear a statement of this principle that I shall 
borrow it for this chapter: 
A myth in its simplest definition is a story with a 
meaning attached to it other than it seems to have at first; 
and the fact that it has such a meaning is generally 
marked by some of its circumstances being extraordinary, 
or, in the common use of the word, unnatural. Thus, if 
I tell you that Hercules killed a water serpent in the lake 
of Lerna, and if I mean, and you understand, nothing 
more than that fact, the story, whether true or false, is 
not a myth. But if, by telling you this, I mean that Her- 
cules purified the stagnation of many streams from 
deadly miasmata, my story, however simple, is a true 
myth, only, as, if I left it in that simplicity, you would 
probably look for nothing beyond, it will be wise in me 
to surprise your attention by adding some singular cir- 
cumstance; for instance, that the water-snake had several 
heads, which revived as fast as they were killed, and 
which poisoned even the foot that trod upon them as they 
slept. And in proportion to the fulness of intended mean-  
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 Literature in the Elementary School 
ing I shall probably multiply and refine upon these im- 
probabilities; or, suppose if, instead of desiring only to 
tell you that Hercules purified a marsh, I wished you to 
understand [that he contended with envy and evil 
ambition], I might tell you that this serpent was formed 
by the goddess whose pride was in the trial of Hercules; 
that its place of abode was by a palm tree; that for 
every head of it that was cut off, ten rose up with 
renewed life; and that the hero found at last he could 
not kill the creature at all by cutting its heads off or 
crushing them, but only by burning them down; and 
that the midmost of them could not be killed even in that 
way, but had to be buried alive. Only in proportion as 
I mean more I shall appear more absurd in my statement. 
Is it fair to conclude that, if there is any 
ground for the statement that myth is more 
imaginative than literature, it is either that it is 
extremely symbolistic, constantly substituting one 
thing for another, or that, not being art, it heaps 
up details profusely, unregulated by the ordering 
and constructive side of the imagination? In the 
one case, it would have small disciplinary value 
for the class; in the other, it would be hopelessly 
beyond their comprehension; and in either case 
it would not perform the characteristic service of 
literature. 
There is much more to be said by those who 
feel that they find in the mythic stories a large 
and vague atmosphere, a sort of cosmic stage 
where things bulk large and sound simple, a great
-P-A-G-E-135
  
Myth as Literature 127 
resounding room where the children feel uncon- 
sciously the movement of large things. But this 
is a religious mood. It is precisely the response 
we should like to have when we tell our children 
the Hebrew myth of the creation—an emotional 
reaction, vague but deep, to the dim and sublime 
images of the Days—a response that constitutes 
itself forevermore a part of his religious experi- 
ence. If we are willing that he should have a 
similar reaction upon the story of Zeus and the 
Titans, if we are willing that he should lay this 
down, too, among the foundations of his religious 
life, by all means tell it. But we can not quite 
fairly tell one to awaken a religious response, and 
the other an artistic one. 
This is all quite consistent with an utter repudi- 
ation of a hard and fast “faculty” education. 
There are, of course, borders where myth and 
literature inextricably intermingle, as there are 
certain effects of the teaching of mythical epi- 
sodes which are not to be distinguished from those 
of the teaching of purely literary material. But 
the teacher should clear up his mind upon this 
point; telling a romantic adventure of a god is 
not teaching myth; telling a story of a hero in 
which the gods take a share is not teaching myth, 
any more than the telling of the story of the Holy 
Grail is teaching Christianity ; symbolistic stories 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  128 Literature in the Elementary School 
whose setting happens to be Greek or Roman or 
Scandinavian are not myth. It should not be 
difficult to handle for the children such stories as 
contain a large amount of religious element. To 
have them get out of the Odyssey the character- 
istic and desirable effect, it is necessary to give 
only a few words as to the offices of Athene and 
Poseidon in the action, and then put the emphasis 
where Homer puts it—upon Odysseus, his charac- 
ter and his experiences. It is no more necessary 
in reading the Odyssey to go into the myth of the 
divinities concerned, than it would be in teaching 
Hamlet to make an exhaustive excursus into the 
pneumatology of the Ghost. 
Now, there are a great many folk-tales that 
out of convention have taken on as a sort of 
afterthought, as it were, an explanatory character. 
This can be noticed in the charming Zufi folk- 
tales collected by Cushing. Often the pourquoi 
idea is appended in the final paragraph, a belated 
bit of piety not at all inherent in the tale. Then 
there are, of course, a great many fanciful pour- 
quoi tales, both folk and modern, whose purpose 
was never more than playful. These cannot be 
seriously regarded as myth, and must be esti- 
mated on their merits as stories. 
It is hard to be so tolerant with the modern 
imitations of mythical tales designed to render
-P-A-G-E-137
  Myth as Literature 129 
palatable and pretty facts in the life of the world 
about us. One cannot believe much in the dew- 
fairies and frost-fairies and flower-angels, speak- 
ing plants and conversing worms, whose mission 
in life is really a gentle species of university- 
extension lectures. Such stories are not litera- 
ture; neither are they good technical knowledge. 
Is it not true, as we shall elsewhere have occasion 
to show, that, with our modern facilities for 
teaching the facts of nature, we can make them 
attractive and impressive rather by showing them 
as they are, than by attributing to them merely 
fanciful and often petty personalities and genii? 
Of couse, in very advanced scientific theory 
we are driven again to myth-making. One can- 
not speak of radio-activity except in terms of 
personality, nor of the final processes of biology 
without using terms implying purpose and choice. 
So does the wheel come full circle and all our 
lives we are mythopoeists. But myth is not liter- 
ature. 
As has been intimated previously, it would 
seem that the time to teach myth as myth is much 
later—perhaps within the secondary period, when 
it can be examined as religion, or when the chil- 
dren have gained enough experience, and de- 
veloped enough dramatic imagination, to take hald 
of it as a vital element in another culture. The
-P-A-G-E-138
  130 Literature in the Elementary School 
place for the study of the great symbolistic stories, 
whose background happens to be another people’s 
myth, such as King Midas, or Prometheus, or 
Apollo with Admetus, should be, in any event, as 
late as the seventh grade, by which time the chil- 
dren are able to look below the surface and begin 
to understand the types and symbols of art.

CHAPTER VIII 
HERO-TALES AND ROMANCES 
In the days before books, when a tale was a 
tale, they knew how to conserve interest and 
economize material. When a hero had gained 
some popular favor, had established his character, 
had drawn about him a circle of friends, and had 
just proved himself worthy of our love, he was 
not lightly cast aside for a new and unknown 
hero. He was given new conquests, new sorrows 
were heaped upon him, new minstrels arose to sing 
his fame, until there gathered about him and his 
group of friends many, many songs and tales. 
Luckily, in many cases there came a great artist, 
bard or romancer, who gathered these scattered 
songs and tales together, gave them a greater or 
less coherence and something of unity, and so 
preserved them. Some of these cycles of hero- 
tales are adapted for the delight and discipline of 
the elementary children. From the cosy and 
homely atmosphere of the Marchen—the mother- 
and nurse-stories—they would pass naturally to 
the wider and bolder world of the epic tales. The 
spirit of these tales harmonizes easily with the 
general tone of their work. They are simple and 
131 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 Literature in the Elementary School 
bold in spirit, full of action, generous and noble 
in plan and idea; they conserve interest and atten- 
tion by centering about a single person or a group; 
they are made up of separable adventures or inci- 
dents, which take shape, or with a little editing 
from the teacher may be made to take shape, as 
manageable and artistic wholes; it is easy to asso- 
ciate other bits of literature with them, because, 
in the first place, the tales themselves reflect 
aspects of life and nature that have appealed to 
artists in all ages, and because they have them- 
selves inspired many more modern artists. It is 
therefore easy to constitute one of these cycles 
the center of the work in literature for some long 
period—in some cases for a whole year—joining 
to it such harmonious or contrasted bits of litera- 
ture as the class may seem to need. 
Some consideration of the best known and 
most available of the hero-tales may help in the 
matter of choosing. 
The Iliad is not available without a great deal 
of editing and rearranging for such use in class. 
There are several reasons for this, the first being 
its want of an easily grasped unity. Doubtless the 
mature and experienced reader finds the essential 
unity of the Iliad more satisfying and artistic than 
that which comes of a more compact and complete 
plot. But the children cannot easily see that the
-P-A-G-E-141
  
Hero-Tales and Romances 133 
history of Achilles’ wrath and love is a complete 
thing. To them the action seems to be suspended, 
the events left without issue, the poem unprovided 
with a legitimate ending. The organization and 
the organizing principle are obscure to children, 
since Achilles’ emotional history cannot easily be 
made clear or interesting to them. Homer’s splen- 
did art in glorifying Hector and dignifying the 
Trojan cause as a means of reinforcing Achilles’ 
triumph, and deepening the sense of the Greek 
victory, is likely to be lost on the children, while 
it leaves them with a hopelessly divided sympathy. 
Helen, to a mature mind so full of interest ethical 
and artistic, is beyond the comprehension of the 
children as anything more than a lay figure. The 
vast enrichment of epic detail that has gathered 
into the Iliad, constituting it for the grown-up 
lover of all the arts an inexhaustible mine of 
archaic, artistic, and psychic wealth, has, except 
in a few picturesque details, which the teacher 
must make special effort to bring before them, 
no charm for the children, seeming to them to 
cumber and delay the action. So the Iliad as it 
stands is not serviceable for the grades in litera- 
ture. 
But, as we all know, the poems that form the 
Iliad were songs out of a much larger cycle. If 
one desires to use sections of the Iliad, then, it  
-P-A-G-E-142
  
  134 Literature in the Elementary School 
is comparatively easy to collect out of all the 
material a complete and unified form of the legend 
of the siege and downfall of Troy—using the 
Homeric episodes when it is possible. From 
sources other than the J/iad must be gathered the 
causes of the war, the education of Achilles, 
the summons of Odysseus, the sacrifice of 
Iphegenia, the death of Achilles, the building of 
the wooden horse, and the fall of Troy. Into this 
can be inserted in their places the parts selected 
from the J/iad—perhaps the quarrel in the assem- 
bly from the second book; the deeds of Diomedes, 
from the fifth and sixth; the visit of Hector 
within the city and his farewell to Andromache, 
from the sixth; the Trojan triumph, in the 
seventh; the vengeance upon Dolon, in the tenth; 
the main incidents of the battle among the ships; 
the deeds and death of Patroclus; Achilles’ arm- 
ing and his appearance in the fight; the main 
incidents of the funeral of Patroclus; the visit 
of Priam to Achilles. These should be arranged 
in a sort of “say and sing” narrative, the events 
previous to the action of the Jliad, and those sub- 
sequent to it, to be told in prose narrative; those 
taken from the Iliad itself to be read or recited in 
some poetical form, linked together, of course, 
by a running and rapid narrative. Only a verse 
transiation—or, if a prose translation, one much
-P-A-G-E-143
Hero-Tales and Romances 135 
more picturesque and eloquent than any we have 
yet had—will at all represent the nobility of the 
Iliad. Bryant’s translation is the best we now 
have, and it is too formal and difficult to be 
understood by the children to whom one desires 
to give the hero-tales. 
One can easily see that an arrangement of the 
Iliad made under all these conditions would not 
finally convey to the children many of the best 
things we want to give them in their literature. 
The case is quite different with the Odyssey. 
It is the child’s own cycle, full of the interests and 
elements that delight him while they cultivate 
him. The adventures are linked together by the 
central hero, and by the design of getting him 
home; the cycle, therefore, presents a clear 
unity, and a unity of the kind that takes hold 
upon the children. The adventures themselves 
organize easily into smaller separable wholes. 
They are always interesting, offering us the 
varieties of the grotesque, the humorous, the 
sensational, the horrible, the beautiful, the sub- 
lime; and they are practically all on the imagina- 
tive level of the children in the classes to which 
they are otherwise adapted. The details are 
charming and adapted to interest the children, 
with very little effort on the part of the teacher. 
It is quite unnecessary to point out how the occu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  136 Literature in the Elementary School 
pations and employments, the beautiful buildings 
and objects—plates, cups, clasps—the raft, the 
palace and garden of Alcinoous, the loom of 
Penelope, the lustrous woven robes, the cottage of 
the good Eumaeus, the noble swineherd, build up a 
world full of charm, not only for the grown-up 
reader, but for children if they are being properly 
taught. There is throughout the poem what Pater 
called the atmosphere of refined craftsmanship, 
and all the occupations and tasks of men here 
appear surrounded by the entrancing halo of art. 
Odysseus combines in himself all those character- 
istics that endear a hero to the child and the 
childlike mind. He is active and ever-ready; 
strong, too, beyond the measure of any ordinary 
man; quick in the battle; good at a game, re- 
sourceful and handy in any emergency; subtle 
and quickwitted ; full of tricks and riddles ; equip- 
ped at every point for the effective undoing of 
his foes. Inevitably in any class of modern chil- 
dren as old as the nine-ten-year grade the deli- 
cate problem of Odysseus’ moral character will 
come up for discussion. It is not likely that chil- 
dren younger than this will open the matter them- 
selves, or take any vital interest in the discussion. 
For, as I have said elsewhere, subtlety is a child’s 
. virtue, and any device by which their hero, who 
is in the main just, outwits or removes hostile 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  
  Hero-Tales and Romances 137 
forces, is acceptable. For the older children, who 
are somewhat “instructed,” and who on the 
average will have acquired sufficient dramatic 
sympathy to apprehend an alien standard, a few 
words as to the Greek notions of truthfulness, 
together with a few explanations as to the privi- 
leges allowed to an adventurer hard beset by trick- 
ery and stupidity, will generally clear the ground; 
these explanations should take the emphasis from 
this aspect of Odysseus’ character and leave the 
children free to place it where it belongs. If the 
Odyssey were used with children older than ten, 
their questions as to Odysseus’ truthfulness might 
afford a good occasion for warning them to 
expect some human imperfections in a hero with 
whom in most respects they are in complete sym- 
pathy. This point of view, acquired somewhat 
early, saves one many shocks and misconceptions 
in later reading. It should not be necessary to say 
that the discussion of Odysseus should not 
amount to “character-study,” and should not drift 
anywhere near hair-splitting moral discrimina- 
tions. 
All teachers will agree that it is better to start 
the Odyssey with the fifth book—the experience 
of Odysseus himself—leaving the Telemachiad 
unread, or to be read later. Into his few intro- 
ductory stories the teacher should fit some account
-P-A-G-E-146
  
138 Literature in the Elementary School 
of the iniquities of the suitors and the fact of 
the journey of Telemachus—this to pave the way 
for the delightful story of his return. For our 
generation—and, one is tempted to believe, for 
several generations to come—Professor Palmer’s 
prose translation of the Odyssey is the ideal read- 
ing version. For the sake of the slight heighten- 
ing of style, the class might occasionally hear 
recited a passage in Bryant’s verse translation. 
But the poetical, musical, faintly archaic prose 
of Professor Palmer has caught perfectly the gen- 
tle spiritual tone of the Odyssey. 
I have known a class of nine-ten-year children 
conducted through the Odyssey making a side 
interest of the Realien, the pottery and weaving. 
and metal working. Such hand-work was a part 
of their school tasks, and there were collections 
of pottery and fabrics which they could be taken 
to see. The experience seemed to co-operate 
with their own hand-work to develop in them 
some of that artistic love of beautiful things— 
things costly, but not expensive—that pervades 
the Iliad and the Odyssey; and they were dis- 
tinctly helped on toward that attitude we desire 
for every child, that of “reverence for the life 
of man upon the earth.” The Odyssey will be 
used, however, in schools where there is no 
handwork and no chance of seeing collections of 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  Hero-Tales and Romances 139 
suitable objects. Pictures are of some service 
in getting the image of objects—colored prints 
of Greek pottery and costume. Engelmann and 
Anderson’s Ailas of the Homeric Poems seems to 
help and interest the children, though there is con- 
stant danger that the archaic forms will seem 
merely ludicrous to many of them. The teacher 
may correct this by explaining them as decora- 
tion and as traditional figures. But we should 
not depend much upon black-and-white print to 
help young children to visualize objects and scenes 
in which color and motion are all-important. 
Now, what follows must be taken as sugges- 
tive, and not as a pat formula: You can enrich 
your central bit of literature by other literature 
in one of two ways—by reinforcing the impres- 
sion derived from the main story, or counteract- 
ing it. And every long story or cycle of stories, 
particularly the heroic cycles, has its characteristic 
atmosphere that needs both to be reinforced and 
to be counteracted. It is true, too, that practi- 
cally all the stories we use for the elementary 
children are translations or derived versions of 
some sort, and do not therefore exhibit the 
smaller beauties of literary form. It is there- 
fore well to join with them poems or other bits 
of literature which emphasize the matter of 
inevitableness of form.  
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 Literature in the Elementary School 
By way of enlarging and varying the atmos- 
phere of the Odyssey, we should not add other 
Greek things, because we are not trying to teach 
our class about Greek civilization, nor to initiate 
them into the Greek spirit, still less to give them 
instruction in Greek legend and mythology. We 
should rather read them ballads and lyrics which 
harmonize with the human spirit of the Odyssey, 
or which supply something which the Odyssey 
fails to give. For example, since there is so much 
of the sea in the story, it would be a good moment 
to teach the children some of the fine things in 
English verse about the water. They will cer- 
tainly notice the characteristic Greek dread and 
terror of the sea—“the unvintaged, unpastured, 
homeless brine.” It would be well to balance this 
in their minds by some of those verses which 
reflect the English mastery of the sea and the 
romance of modern sea-going—some of Kipling’s 
sea-ballads, for example, or such simple things as 
Barry Cornwall’s “The sea, the sea, the open 
sea.” 
We should not fail to build upon another domi- 
nant note in the Odyssey much that we should 
like the children to have—the note of home and 
home-coming, the hearth-stone, and the shelter- 
ing roof. Of the exciting adventure and the joy 
of physical contest they will get enough from the
-P-A-G-E-149
  Hero-Tales and Romances 141 
stories themselves. It is not necessary to say again 
that the judgments given here as to the actual 
practical choice, are always to be taken as sug- 
gestions, not as hard and fast directions. Every 
teacher may have, and should have, his own idea, 
both as to how his central bit of literature should 
be supplemented, and as to whether or not it needs 
supplementing. Later I shall give the titles of 
certain of these minor things—still by way of 
suggestion; ballads and lyrics that have been 
found to harmonize with the Odyssey either as 
enforcement or addition. 
Most elementary schools have found now the 
value of the Robin Hood legend. The bluff, open 
qualities, the effective activities, the wholesome 
objectivity of these activities, the breezy atmos- 
phere with which the stories surround them- 
selves, make them acceptable in many aspects. 
Teachers are saved most of the labor of mak- 
ing their own digest of the Robin Hood material 
by Howard Pyle’s Robin Hood. In this he has 
drawn together the whole legend, using not only 
the English ballads, but Scott and Peacock, and 
whatever scattered hints and details he could 
gather from what must have been a pretty ex- 
haustive reading of English romantic literature. 
Everywhere there are charming reminiscences of 
Chaucer, of Spenser, of Shakespeare; echoes of 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
142 Literature in the Elementary School 
ballad and song and romance; making, on the 
whole, a notable introduction to literature and the 
literary method. One quickly finds that it is much 
too literary in places for younger children and has 
to be simplified; here and there are long idyllic 
descriptions that the fifth grade, eager for the 
story, will not brook; occasionally a page of false 
sentimentality that the teacher with a true ear will 
infallibly detect and skip. But these minor things 
can be forgiven in view of the sheer energy, the 
marvelous objectivity, the epic colorlessness, of 
the book as a whole. Readings from the ballads 
themselves should be interspersed, read by the 
teacher to the class. These readings should again 
be arranged in the cont-fable fashion, turning 
into suitable form the less interesting passages, 
and then reading in their original verse form the 
dramatic and picturesque parts. It need not be 
said that much better poems may be found than 
those which Pyle has composed for his Robin 
Hood. 
Timid parents and teachers who have never 
used these stories have some misgivings as 
to the effect of the strenuous, not to say lawless, 
atmosphere. They say that the burden of ap- 
proval is placed upon an outlaw, who constantly 
and successfully flouts the officers and processes 
of the law; that the merry-men are, after all, the 
   
-P-A-G-E-151
  Hero-Tales and Romances 143 
gang; that the multiplicity of quarrels and 
cracked crowns accustoms the children to blood 
and violence; in short, that the legitimate out- 
come of a genuine dramatic sympathy with the 
story is general Hooliganism. The good teach- 
ers who have used the stories never say these 
things becausé they never see these results. It 
needs but a word to transfer the emphasis from 
Robin Hood’s outlawry to the cruel and unjust 
laws against which he stood; to keep to the 
front his generosity to his men, his tenderness 
toward those in trouble, his sense of personal 
honor, his readiness to accept and acknowledge a 
fair defeat, the loyalty of his men. It is the 
transfiguration of the gang; and as a social mat- 
ter it is the transfiguration rather than the 
destruction of the gang which we desire to ac- 
complish. One hastens to acknowledge, how- 
ever, that the rough-and-tumble atmosphere of 
the stories calls for some antidote, which we may 
find partly in the literature we choose to accom- 
pany this cycle. Very naturally one thinks of the 
greenwood, and at once finds many bits that fit 
into the scenic background of the story and intro- 
duce the gentler aspects of the woods and wood- 
land things. 
With the Odyssey we should choose some 
things to reinforce the love of home and the long- 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  144 Literature in the Elementary School 
ing for the hearth-fire, and we must use some of 
the same things to provide an element otherwise 
lacking in the Robin Hood, and to modify the 
fascination of the wildwood life and the unat- 
tached condition. Some of the ideas on the sur- 
face of the stories may be enlarged and enriched 
—as loyalty and devotion to a leader. There 
is a fine opportunity to launch into the children’s 
experience upon the wave of their enthusiasm for 
Robin Hood, other and nobler ideals of the leader 
and the hero; though we must never expect the 
child, glowing with the satisfaction of deeds done, 
to give any appreciation worth considering to the 
suffering hero or to the heroism of peace. This 
properly belongs to a much later period—to what 
it is not mere jargon to call the lyric age, when 
some more effective appeal can be made to those 
powers that come of introspection. 
The cycles of stories of King Arthur un- 
questionably contain much that should contribute 
to the pleasure and wholesome culture of the ele- 
mentary child. Epic activity, bold and generous 
deeds tempered by gentleness and reverence—this 
is the atmosphere of the best of the Arthur stories, 
and it is precisely the atmosphere into which one 
longs to lead the older children of the elementary 
school. But these good and suitable Arthur 
stories are so tied up with others entirely unsuit-
-P-A-G-E-153
Hero-Tales and Romances 145 
able that the choosing and arranging of them 
becomes the task of the expert psychologist and 
critic. When one chooses stories out of this 
legend, he must do with his material—his Malory, 
his Chrétien, his Mabinogion, his Tennyson—as 
these collectors and artists did with theirs: regard 
it as the stuff of human nature and life, a store- 
house of treasures out of which he may draw 
according to his pleasure or his’need. In this 
case it is the safe pleasure and the artistic 
needs of his children that will dictate his choice. 
And he must know thoroughly well his stories and 
his children; for the pitfalls are many—dquite as 
many in Chrétien de Troyes and Malory as in 
Tennyson. 
The first of the pitfalls to be avoided is that 
fantastic feudal gallantry which Chrétien and 
Malory substituted for the forthright chivalric 
business and earnestness of the older legendary 
stories. In the Song of Roland one fights for 
reasons of patriotism or religion; in the Arthur 
romances, and others of their type, one fights for 
his lady’s sake. In the elementary grades the chil- 
dren are still undifferentiated human beings, and 
should be kept so. To thrust upon them sugges- 
tions of “ladies” to be “won” and to be “served” 
is to usher them into an unknown world, an 
undemocratic and unbrotherly world from which 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  146 Literature in the Elementary School 
we should like to keep them, especially the girls, 
as long as possible. While it is not easy to leave 
out this element in choosing material from these 
cycles, it is possible to treat it lightly, since there 
is in the same material a sufficiency of lions to be 
hunted, giants to be overcome, and hostile Pay- 
nims to be exterminated. 
Everyone who has ever read much with chil- 
dren knows that to normal children before their 
thirteenth year the psychology and modus oper- 
andi of love and love-making, innocent or guilty, 
are so alien as to pass harmlessly by them as a 
mere bit of the machinery of a story, when these 
notions do constitute such a bit of machinery in a 
story otherwise suitable. But it is a mistake to 
choose matter which obliges us to linger with the 
little people over these experiences or to empha- 
size them. He who would retell the Arthur 
stories must be wary here, so difficult is it to put 
together any series of the adventures that will at 
all represent the material, and constitute a whole, 
without using the scarlet thread of guilty passion, 
or substituting for it something “nice” but wishy- 
washy. We have only to compare the grim 
justice of Malory’s Modred with Tennyson’s 
sentimental and unconvincing handling of his 
character and function. 
When Malory wove into the Arthur cycle the
-P-A-G-E-155
  Hero-Tales and Romances 147 
legend of the Holy Grail, he introduced an ele- 
ment very hard to handle for children—that 
religious mysticism, not to say fanaticism, which 
Tennyson chose to set as the pivotal motive of the 
downfall of the Table Round. Tennyson, writ- 
ing for mature modern readers a deeply symbol- 
istic poem, and presenting a whole cycle, could, 
stroke by stroke, build up the impression of this 
burning zeal, this hypnotic trance of enthusiasm, 
that led men away after wandering fires, for- 
getting labor and duty. But simplified to fit the 
comprehension of the wholesome twelve-year-old 
it is likely to appear a vague and mistaken piety, 
producing a practical effect quite out of propor- 
tion to its importance. 
To the modern teacher, with the witchery of 
the Tennysonian music in his blood, it is all but 
impossible to keep out of prominence that sym- 
bolism which lay obvious upon the surface, even 
in the Morte d’Arthur, but which Tennyson 
heightened into an almost oppressive system of 
sophisticated and parochial doctrine. An occa- 
sional symbolistic nut to crack is not a bad thing 
for the older children of the grades. But would 
it not be a mistake to immerse them in a great 
system of symbolism? To the younger children 
the sacred outside appearance, the entrancing 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  148 Literature in the Elementary School 
Schein, of things is best, and symbolistic art only 
baffles them or unduly forces their powers. 
The spirit of dilettante adventure which per- 
vades the mediaeval romances gives them a tone 
entirely different from that of the epics. In these 
latter the activities attach themselves to deeds that 
have to be done, to misfortunes that. the hero 
would willingly have avoided. Some of these 
sought-out adventures have crept insidiously into 
Howard Pyle’s Robin Hood; but they are 
entirely foreign to the spirit of the original epos. 
The idea of “worshipfully winning worship,” 
of seeking adventure for mere adventure’s sake, 
or for the mere display of one’s own powers, or 
for the sake of getting trained, is a corrupting one 
in our society, and should not be implanted in 
our children’s consciousness. Like the old epic 
heroes, what we have to do we will do—often 
boldly; but, like the old epic heroes, we will do 
it because it needs to be done. 
We can get together a series of stories from 
the Arthur romance that will touch but lightly the 
exaggerated, false devotion to ladies; that will 
leave out of sight the guilty passion which lies at 
the center of Malory’s poem and of most of the 
other literary versions; that will put into a minor 
place the mystical religious element that lingers 
about the Holy Grail side of the romance; that
-P-A-G-E-157
  Hero-Tales and Romances 149 
will make little of the symbolism, ignore the dil- 
ettante and merely amateur adventure, handling 
the heroic rather than the romantic deeds—that 
will do all these things and still be a romance of 
King Arthur. He who would make such a version 
must choose out from Malory or The Mabino- 
gion, material that belongs in such a series. Or 
he may find his material more sifted for him in 
Lanier’s The Boy’s King Arthur, and Knightly 
Legends of Wales. Let him make much of 
Arthur, simple of nature, guileless and strong, 
looking to conquest and the good of his people 
rather than to his own “worship” or to his own 
love-affairs; let him by no means neglect Merlin, 
the most permanently interesting figure; he is 
Odysseus among the Greeks, the sacred bard 
_ among the warriors, Tusitala in Samoa, the subtle 
one, always so appealing and so satisfying to a 
child’s imagination—the embodiment of that intel- 
lectual dominance which, be it wisdom or magic, 
always stands beside epic achievement in the 
child’s estimation. And having got it together, 
he may reassure himself, as regards his epos of 
King Arthur, that there is no one Arthur; that 
the whole legend is a mine out of which every 
student may draw a treasure; or, to change the 
figure, a great, beautiful field in which many peo- 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  
  150 Literature in the Elementary School 
ple may gather grain according to their need and 
their taste. 
Much later when, as growing youth, they are 
waking up to certain mature social problems, the 
children will be ready for the style and matter of 
Tennyson’s Idylls. But they will not get the 
characteristic value of the legend till, as mature 
and experienced readers of books and livers of 
life, they come back to Malory and Chrétien de 
Troyes. 
Many wise teachers will dissent wholly from 
this view of the Arthur stories, and in many 
schools they are presented in some form in the 
fourth or fifth grade, and read in the Idylls of the 
King in the seventh and eighth. Suggestions for 
literature to accompany them will be found in a 
later chapter. 
Anybody who has read thus far can easily 
foretell what will be said about the Siegfried 
legend. In the huge accummulation of sagas, 
romances, and operas that now go to make up 
the legend, there are all sorts of material—much 
of it totally unsuited for children. So far as I 
have been able to find, there has not yet been made 
*—certainly not in English—a collection of the 
stories good in itself and good for children. The 
teacher must do his own sifting and arranging, if 
it seems well to study the Siegfried stories within
-P-A-G-E-159
  Hero-Tales and Romances I51 
the grades. The collection of the stories that 
makes up the Niebelungen Lied is particularly 
poor in fitting material, being sordid and coarse in 
the domestic parts, and tediously bloody in the 
heroic parts. Among the mass of stories given by 
Morris and Magnussen in the Vélsunga Saga, 
and in Morris’ Sigurd the Volsung, one may find 
material for making his own epos of Siegfried, 
simple, heroic, triumphant—the Siegfried who 
killed Fafnir, escaped the snares of Regin, got 
the Nibelung treasure, rode through the magic 
fire and freed Brunhild. You may he sure some 
old saga-singer closed the story here, and so may 
we. This leaves for a much later day in the 
child’s life the tragic Siegfried, whose domestic 
experience, with its sordid motives, its bitter quar- 
rels and ugly subterfuges, is surely not beautiful 
or fitting for the children; and whose treacherous 
taking-off is followed by a vengeance too grim 
and too merely fatalistic to be planted in a child’s 
consciousness. 
As we find a sort of canon of fairy-tales, so we 
find a somewhat accredited list of hero-tales, and 
the five we have discussed comprise it. Occasion- 
ally a teacher may enrich his material by an epi- 
sode from The Cid, from the Song of Roland, 
from the heroic sagas of Iceland, from some other 
mediaeval romance; but they will not detain him 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  152 Literature in the Elementary School 
long, nor will any one of them constitute a really 
good center for a prolonged study. 
In the later years of this period certain classes 
and certain schools may find it well to read some 
of the literary stories of adventure, such as Ivan- 
hoe, or Treasure Island, or The Last of the 
Mohicans. In the really great stories of adven- 
ture we find many of the things we know to be 
good for the children—the “large room,” the open 
atmosphere, forest, sea, prairie, all the most dis- 
astrous chances of war and of travel, noble 
deeds and generous character. Every parent and 
teacher recognizes the danger which lies in the 
child’s having too much even of good story of 
adventure. And this sort of story is the peculiar 
field of the cheap story-teller, in whose work the 
weaknesses and dangers of the species especially 
abound. Since the “out-put” of such stories is 
enormous, and since the children’s access to them, 
in communities where they can buy books, or 
have the use of a public library, is practically 
unlimited, all teachers and parents should know 
the marks of the undesirable story of adventure, 
and be able to guard against it. The weakness 
and dangers of such a story are these: 
1. The details are exaggerated until the 
event is too striking and too highly flavored, so
-P-A-G-E-161
  Hero-Tales and Romances 153 
as to corrupt the taste and create an appetite that 
continues to demand gross satisfaction. 
2. There are likely to be too many sensations. 
The inartistic story of adventure does not work 
up its incidents with an accumulation of details 
and an effect of the passage of time that gives it 
verisimilitude, but rushes forward with a crude 
and ill-digested happening on every five pages. It 
is hard to believe that any artistic impression is 
made upon children whose minds are excited and 
jaded by such books. They are a mere indul- 
gence. 
3. In all but the best adventure the strain of 
suspense and surprise is more than the children 
should be asked to endure. Too many experiences 
of long tension and final hair-breadth escape 
weaken a child’s credence and harden his emo- 
tions so as to ruin his power of responding to such 
appeals. The devices of suspense and surprise 
are employed, to be sure, by the masters, but gen- 
erally in due amount; while they are invariably 
overworked by the cheap writer of adventure. 
4. The facts of life and history are distorted 
and discolored. This is the condemnation of such 
books as the Henty books. They profess to attach 
themselves to historical events or periods, while 
as a matter of fact, they have nothing of the event 
or the period in them, except a few names and 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  154 Literature in the Elementary School 
reflections of the most obvious aspects of the mere 
surface facts. As reflection of a period, or as 
illumination of an event in it, they are worse than 
useless—they are absurdly misleading. Only a 
genius, or a student who has immersed himself in 
the matter, can produce a story whose psychology, 
sociology, and archaeology will throw real light 
upon a bygone age or event. There are such 
stories, but they are not for elementary children; 
or, if they are, only as adventure, not as history. 
No one who chooses books for children should be 
misled by these cheap manufactured stories which 
claim as their reason for being that they have a 
historical background. After all, it is Scott who 
has given us the best big stories of adventure. 
Ivanhoe, Quentin Durward, Anne of Geierstein, 
Guy Mannering, with the proper condensations 
and adaptations, are of the best. Cooper, in cer- 
tain of the Leatherstocking novels, creates the 
atmosphere of really great adventure. Steven- 
son knew the art of writing a “rattling good 
story,” which yet keeps that balance of judgment 
and sense of proportion, that faithfulness to the 
truth (not the fact) of experience, which prevent 
its ever degenerating into sensationalism. Quiller- 
Couch and Joseph Conrad are two more modern 
writers who have achieved in many cases the level 
of great stories of adventure.
-P-A-G-E-163
  
Hero-Tales and Romances 155 
It is not probable that children who are given 
the older epics and romances in school will have 
time for these more modern romances of adven- 
ture in the class. But whoever guides their out- 
of-school reading, be it parent or teacher, should 
have in mind these few simple grounds of choice. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
    CHAPTER IX 
REALISTIC STORIES 
In the material we use for children, while it 
is not profitable to draw any close distinctions 
between romantic and realistic stories, we can 
not fail to distinguish in general between the 
hero-tale or the folk Mdarchen, where we must 
expect preternatural powers and marvelous 
events, and the story which purports to deal 
with real people, and with experiences which, 
however rare, are still possible or probable. 
And these stories of real people and actual 
experiences have their value for the children— 
their own value, first of all, as making a distinct 
contribution to the child’s education, and another 
value as tending to counteract and balance the 
effects of the thoroughgoing romances. No one 
questions the fact that there are ill effects from 
too much romance and too many marvels. A 
child’s vision of the world does become dis- 
torted if it is too often or too long organized 
upon a plan dominated by the wonderful or the 
fantastic; his sense of fact dulled, if his imagi- 
nation is called upon to appreciate and to pro- 
duce prevailingly the unusual combinations; his 
156 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  Realistic Stories 157 
taste vitiated, if he is supplied too abundantly with 
those striking and super-emotional incidents 
which fill the romances. All these dangers are 
counteracted in part by the child’s fact-studies, 
and by his experiences in actual life. But this 
is not sufficient; it is artistically due him that 
the antidote should have the same kind of charm » 
as the original poison. It is well, too, to bear in 
mind that even the small children should be 
appealed to on several sides, and that their taste 
should be made as catholic as possible. One is 
sorry to find a child of eight or ten who likes 
only fairy-tales, or war-stories, or detective 
stories ; he should like all stories. 
But we are more interested, naturally, in the 
positive services performed by the stories of real 
life; or to be more explicit, those stories told with 
the effect of actuality, and with the atmosphere of 
verisimilitude. Of course, we should require of 
these stories good form and good writing, so that 
we may expect from them on that side what 
we expect from any good literature. In addition, 
we may expect them to perform for the children 
and for all of us certain distinctive artistic ser- 
vices. First, they operate to throw back upon 
actual life the glow of art. Those stories which 
use people and circumstances that we can match 
in our own actual surroundings and experiences
-P-A-G-E-166
158 Literature in the Elementary School 
impress upon us most vividly the fact, so im- 
portant for our real culture both in art and in 
life, that literature is in a very real sense a pres- 
entation of life; that these charming people and 
things are but images taken up from the real 
world, chosen and raised to this level, by which 
very process they are invested with a halo of 
beauty and distinction. This nimbus of art casts 
back upon life some of its own radiance, digni- 
fying and enriching it, and to many minds 
revealing for the first time beauty and meaning 
which they would otherwise never have seen; so 
that we truly see and rightly interpret many of 
the people and things in our own lives only after 
we have seen the mates of them in a story or a 
poem. A group of children who had been helped 
to make a verse about rosy radishes, and had 
then done a water-color picture of a plate of the 
same vegetable, found for many days new and 
artistic joy in a grocer’s window. The same 
children, having learned Lowell’s phrase of the 
dandelion’s “dusty gold,” were not satisfied till 
they had made a beautiful phrase to render the 
burnished gold of the butter-cups. The same 
class on a picnic labored with ardor to make 
a beautiful verse about Uneeda biscuits and 
ginger-ale, to match the Persian’s “A Jug of 
Wine, a Loaf of Bread.” They were much baffled 
   
-P-A-G-E-167
Realistic Stories 159 
when they finally concluded that it would not go 
—that these modern and specific articles refused 
to wear a halo. 
The obverse and counterpart of this glow 
caught by the actual world from art is the vital 
interest that surrounds a person, or an object, 
or a sentiment which we come upon in a poem 
or a story, and which we recognize as correspond- 
ing to something in our own experience—a recog- 
nition all the more satisfying if the correspond- 
ence be that of actual identity. Every teacher 
of younger children recalls at once the tingling 
interest they feel in practically every story they 
are told, as some incident or detail parallels or 
suggests something they have known—“My 
father has seen a bear;” “Once I found an eagle’s 
feather ;” “There are daffodils in my grand- 
mother’s garden.” A little girl of ten had been 
given a very simple arrangement of a melody 
from Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony to play on 
the piano. Soon after she had learned it, she 
was taken to hear the symphony. When her 
melody came dropping in from the flutes and 
violins—birds and brooks and whispering leaves 
—she threw up at her friend a flash of radiant 
surprise and delight. Her whole soul stirred to 
see here—in this stately place, with the great 
orchestra, in the noble assemblage of glorious 
   
-P-A-G-E-168
  160 Literature in the Elementary School 
concords—her friend, her little song. For days 
she played it over many times every day, with 
the greatest tenderness of expression. 
The wise teacher sees in this eager recogni- 
tion and identification one of the most desirable 
results of literary experience, and utilizes it as 
the most precious of educational opportunities, 
since this mood of delighted recognition is with 
the younger children also the mood of creation, 
and with the older children the most useful and 
practical clue to the finding of their own literary 
material. 
It is in this kind of story—those that reflect 
the events of actual life and are concerned with 
ordinary people—that we are able to introduce 
our children in art to their contemporaries and 
coevals. It means much for a child’s conscious- 
ness that he should develop a quick and dramatic 
sympathy with lives other than his own, and 
yet like his own—with the experiences. and 
characters of other children, other folks’ ways of 
living. This sympathy is among the literary 
products, since it is best developed and fostered by 
literature; this because it is literature only, that 
handles its material in that concrete and emo- 
tional way which produces the impression of 
actual reality and serves as a substitute for it.
-P-A-G-E-169
  Realistic Stories 161 
Teach the little children Stevenson’s 
Little Indian, Sioux or Crow, 
Little frosty Eskimo, 
Little Turk or Japanee, 
and teach it with the natural implications that 
will occur to any teacher of expedients, and you 
will have taught them a certain attitude of con- 
fidential understanding toward their brown 
brothers (in spite of the decidedly chauvinistic 
character of this masterpiece) that they would 
not have got out of a year of social history. 
The difficulties of choosing stories of modern 
child-life for teaching in school are serious. 
They are most likely to be thin in material, 
flimsy in structure, trivial in style, sentimental in 
atmosphere, so that they fall to pieces under the 
test of study in a class of acute and questioning 
children. It is best not to choose any long book 
of this sort. For the younger children use the 
shorter bits of story, such as may be found in 
Laura Richards’ Five Minute Stories, or such as 
any teacher may collect for herself from many 
sources; occasionally one may find a perfect 
specimen in one of the children’s periodicals, and 
there is now a wealth of such things in verse. 
We must be wary of those books about children, 
interpretative of children, of which our own day 
has produced so many charming specimens, 
   
-P-A-G-E-170
  
  162 Literature in the Elementary School 
whose appeal is entirely to adults. Such are 
Pater’s The Child in the House, and Kenneth 
Graham’s The Golden Age. Part of A Child’s 
Garden of Verses is of this kind. Of this sort, too, 
is the pretty little Emmy Lou, an interpretation 
of a child’s consciousness, not a children’s story. 
The general question of the reading of juve- 
niles will be left for a chapter of miscellanies 
farther on. It is not possible to make any long 
book about children the center of a class’s work. 
Such material is best used as a sort of reserve, a 
recreation from time to time, and is best given 
in short stories that can be read at intervals; or 
if it be a long story, one that can be distributed 
among the other reading. It is true of this kind 
of story too, that the best results come of using 
material not made especially for children, but 
which appeals to children, however, because it 
appeals to universal and elemental human nature. 
Among the folk-tales are many of the real- 
istic type that are most serviceable. Like the 
folk fairy-tales they have that mysteriously but 
truly universal appeal, which makes them child- 
like, though originally they were not made for 
children. They are those comic and realistic 
tales which may originally have been coarse, but 
which have been refined by years and winnowed 
by use until they have taken on a form and value
-P-A-G-E-171
  Realistic Stories 163 
like those of some piece of ancient peasant hand- 
work—they are simple, genuine, homely art. 
Such are Kluge Else, Hans in Luck, Great 
Claus and Little Claus, The Three Sillies and all 
the delightful company of noodles, and the great 
family of plain folks with their homely affairs. 
Of course, the great classic of the realistic 
method suited for children is Robinson Crusoe. 
From the days of Rousseau who designated it as 
the one book to be given to his ideally educated 
child, teachers have appreciated its value. In- 
deed, a very curious, but not unnatural, thing 
has happened, in the fact that this book has 
been so long and closely associated with chil- 
dren that it has come to be considered a sort 
of nursery classic, a wonder-tale composed for 
infants, by hosts of people who have no idea 
that it is in reality a masterly realistic novel and a 
profoundly philosophical culture-document—an 
epoch-making piece of art. Fortunately, it is easy 
to prepare it for the children; it is largely a 
matter of leaving out the reflective passages, and 
of translating into modern English the very few 
phrases and turns of expression now obsolete. 
One would deplore the reduction of the story for 
any purpose to mere babble—to words of one 
syllable, or any other form that destroys the 
flavor of Defoe’s convincing style. It is easy 
   
-P-A-G-E-172
  164 Literature in the Elementary School 
to arrange the experiences so that the story serves 
the purposes of a cycle—a single experience con- 
stituting a portion which may be treated as a 
complete thing; for example, the making of the 
baskets, the construction of the pots, the saving 
of the seed. 
Robinson Crusoe is a treasure to many a grade 
teacher, because it really “correlates” beautifully 
with work that the children are doing, or might 
well be doing, in the third and fourth grades; 
whether in their history study, where they are 
devising food and shelter, or have advanced to 
the study of trades and crafts; or, under an 
entirely different scheme, have started on the 
study of voyagers and colonists. The art and the 
charm of Robinson Crusoe, and the secret of 
its literary value for the child, lie in the power 
of the sheer realism—a realism not so much of 
material as of method—to hold and convince us. 
A part of this realism is the richness and homeli- 
ness of detail; the painstaking record of failures 
and tentative achievements; the calm, judicial 
view of experiments; the colorless flow of long 
periods of time; the homely, and as it were domes- 
tic, worth of Crusoe’s successes. Oh, it is a great 
and convincing book! How great and how con- 
vincing one may realize when he reads the only 
one of the innumerable “Robinsons,” taking their
-P-A-G-E-173
    Realistic Stories 165 
inspiration from Defoe’s bwok, that really sur- 
vives—the Swiss Family Robinson, with its 
facile and too often fatuous ease of accomplish- 
ment, its total lack of reality, its stupid and blun- 
dering didacticism, its impossible jumble of detail, 
its commonplace romance; yet, we must reluc- 
tantly add, its unfailing charm for the children. 
That a book with all these faults keeps its hold 
upon the successive generations of children is 
testimony to the fact that its basis of interest, 
which is also for children the essential interest of 
Robinson Crusoe—the old foundation process of 
getting fire and roof and coat and bread—is the 
romance that is forever fresh and thrilling. 
The exceedingly thoroughgoing realism of the 
method (notice, not the large frame-work, which 
is sufficiently romantic) of Robinson Crusoe 
would suggest at once that it might profitably be 
accompanied by some bits of literature that would 
throw a more romantic and idealistic coloring 
upon the primitive craftsman and his craft, and 
upon the experiences of voyager and colonist. 
Such would be Bret Harte’s Columbus, Mrs. 
Hemans’ The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, 
Marvell’s Bermudas (with a few difficult lines 
omitted). Longfellow’s Jasper Becerra, the 
twenty-third Psalm, and several chapters from 
Treasure Island. Every teacher could add other 
titles.
-P-A-G-E-174
    166 Literature in the Elementary School 
The older children—those of the seventh and 
eighth grades—may profitably read in school, for 
the sake of the intellectual experience, a classic 
detective story or a story whose plot and evolu- 
tion present an almost purely intellectual prob- 
lem. It is true that the air of intellectual acumen 
that pervades most of these stories is specious, 
and that they are in reality, and as a rule, shallow 
and unlogical pieces of reasoning. But it takes an 
older and more expert person to see this for him- 
self. The teacher should try to qualify his chil- 
dren for judging a good story of this kind, and 
save them, if possible, from the detective-story 
habit, which wastes much good time and fills a 
child’s mind with very cheap problems. But if he 
choose a good story of this kind for reading with 
his class, he may help to set their minds going in 
that region where the imagination must ally itself 
with logic and with a reasoned and inevitable 
progress of events. Properly channeled, this is 
a most valuable experience, both from the purely 
mental and from the literary points of. view. 
. After all, the best detective story in English is 
Poe’s The Gold Bug. There is, of course, that 
element in Treasure Island, but, being there so 
interwoven with the romantic and adventurous 
details of that delectable tale, it is not likely to 
yield for the children that peculiar bit of training
-P-A-G-E-175
Realistic Stories 167 
which they might get from the more unmixed 
intellectuality and more obvious realism of The 
Gold Bug. 
It is difficult to know what to say, and where 
to say it, concerning Don Quixote. That trium- 
phant book is assuredly a masterpiece of the 
realistic method. It came as an antidote and 
tonic, helping to restore health and sanity to a 
romance-sick world, and it ought to have a place 
in the discipline of certain kinds of young people. 
But it cannot be said that this place is always with- 
in the elementary period, unless a certain grade or 
certain children have had a peculiar experience 
and can be said to need it. If the grade has had 
the King Arthur stories of Malory or Tennyson 
in large amounts with a very earnest teacher, 
they can very certainly be said to need Don 
Quixote—always, of course, shortened and ex- 
purgated, and in carefully chosen episodes; from 
which process—such is its essential greatness, and 
such the character of its unity—it suffers less 
than any other story in the world. We should 
be quite aware of the danger of giving the chil- 
dren any large amount of this peculiar kind of 
realism—that which constitutes itself a satire and 
a sort of parody on some over-serious bit of 
romance. Nothing is more deadening and more 
commonplace than this peculiar form of wit, 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  
168 Literature in the Elementary School 
when it becomes a habit or offers itself in a mass. 
But the peculiar vitality and richness of Don 
Quixote lifts it far above the level of parody, 
constituting it a magnificent original piece of art 
in itself. However, the whole question must be 
left open. It may be that not until he is far 
along in the secondary school or in college is the 
scholar suffering for Don Quixote, or capable of 
appreciating it. 
Among the older children the note of realism 
and wit may be sounded in a wisely chosen essay. 
Of course, they are not ready for the indirect 
and allusive manner, nor for the lyric egoism, of 
the pure literary essay. But there are essays of 
Lamb’s, a very few of Steele’s, some of Sidney 
Smith’s, some of the more literary of Burroughs’ 
nature-studies, bits of Oliver Wendell Holmes 
and Charles Dudley Warner, that are ideal for 
them. 
Shall we sum up by saying that, on the whole, 
we find the romantic and fanciful stories best 
suited in form and spirit to the elementary chil- 
dren; since realistic stories that are really good 
art, are, as a rule, too mature and too difficult for 
the children, and realistic stories of the juvenile 
type are not good enough either in form or in 
content to justify long class study? However, 
certain distinctive and desirable results may be 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  Realistic Stories 169 
expected from specimens interwoven here and 
there of that kind of story which represents real 
life, which uses events both possible and prob- 
able, and which handles its material by the method 
of realistic detail. In the earliest years these may 
be secured by the reading of well-chosen little 
stories of modern children—indeed, of any 
modern material, provided it be simple enough— 
and by the teaching of verses which reflect aspects 
of actual life—human life or nature. In the 
third or fourth grade Robinson Crusoe forms a 
desirable basis for the year’s work. It should 
always be accompanied by shorter bits of a more 
romantic and heroic type. Later in the elemen- 
tary period—say in the sixth or seventh grade— 
the reasonable and practical element may be intro- 
duced in the form of a story of the detective kind 
—a story whose plot presents an intellectual 
problem, whose atmosphere and method make the 
impression of actual fact. And in the seventh and 
eighth grade these same purposes—that of ex- 
hibiting to the children actual human life as art 
sees it, that of bringing them into educational 
contact with the realistic method, that of counter- 
acting any possible mental danger from too much 
romance and adventure—may be served by essays 
chosen on principles already many times sug- 
gested.

    CHAPTER X 
NATURE AND ANIMAL STORIES 
In a discussion of these stories we should again 
take to ourselves the warning that we must guard 
constantly and carefully against too narrow a 
view of literature. The reckless lack of knowl- 
edge and experience that sweeps into the cate- 
gory of literature everything expressed in words 
is so irritating to a careful student that he is 
always in danger of allowing his irritation to help 
carry him to the other extreme—that of an 
uncatholic exclusiveness. We must, however, be 
aware of the fact that other kinds of writing, 
entirely technical and special in their simpler 
varieties, are constantly approaching the borders 
of literature, as they become more and more 
humanized, draw about them more and more 
of emotional association, and take on more of 
the graces of the arts of writing. We must be 
aware of this, and we must be, as it were, con- 
stantly on the lookout for a possible new arrival 
among the kinds of literature, and be prepared to 
give it hospitality; and we must acknowledge 
that some of the results which we desire to 
accomplish through genuine literature are accom- 
179
-P-A-G-E-179
  
Nature and Animal Stories 171 
plished through those things that have only some 
of the characteristics of literature. But still, for 
the sake of the good pedagogical and critical con- 
science, and for the sake of keeping the funda- 
mental distinctions as clear as possible, the teacher 
needs to know precisely what he is doing when 
he is using this material. He must decide, in the 
very earliest years of a child’s education, whether 
he is teaching facts and theories, or presenting art, 
in his story. 
The custom of using animals and plants to 
represent human beings and to express human 
meanings is as old as folk-art itself. Quite as 
old, too, is the revelation that the creatures have 
individualities and personalities of their own to 
be dramatically and sympathetically set forth in 
terms of human psychology, in default of a truer 
one. The mind of man goeth not back to the 
time when the fox, the cock, and the ass—Rey- 
nard, Chanticleer, and Brunel—the rabbit, the 
eagle, the oak, and the vine, were not well-defined 
characters, well provided with affairs. But this 
early folk treatment of the creatures was dis- 
tinctly art, occasionally morals, but not science. 
It did not aim to teach the facts as to the struc- 
ture and habits of the creatures as life-forms. It 
interpreted human life through them or them 
by means of human terms. 
   
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 Literature in the Elementary School 
Precisely here we must begin our discrimina- 
tion between real literature and ‘“‘nature-stories ;” 
The longing to pass down to the infant mind the 
results of scientific discovery has produced in our 
generation (perhaps it was really produced in the 
generation preceding ours) an enormous crop of 
most anomalous growths in this field of nature- 
stories. A favorite method of teaching a child the 
facts about any object or process in nature 
has been to translate it into a story of human 
affairs, or draw it up as a picture of a human 
situation, involving naturally and inevitably, a 
multitude of extraneous or misleading details. 
For example, we would teach a child about the 
distribution of the dandelion plant. So we con- 
struct the “Story of the Dandelion Seed.” Now, 
there undoubtedly is a story of the dandelion 
seed. Incident follows incident, stage follows 
stage, from bloom to bloom again—every step 
beautiful and interesting in itself, and to be com- 
pletely trusted to make its own appeal, just dis- 
played for itself. But some people doubt this. 
They have lost, or have never acquired, that faith 
in nature and her processes which trusts to this 
appeal; and then they long—and this is quite 
natural—to enlist in aid of their fact-studies the 
charm and the emotion that lie in literature. So 
they endow the Dandelion Seed with a papa and
-P-A-G-E-181
  Nature and Animal Stories 173 
a mama—a jovial suburbanite of a papa, and a 
fussy, sentimentalizing mama—with a cradle, 
with a vocabulary, with a system of morals (there 
are even “naughty” Dandelion Seeds), and with 
many feelings. They tell about his “home,” his 
infancy, his training, his departure, his settling 
in a new home—all the while with the intention 
of teaching their infants the facts, but all the 
while covering them up under a trivial and un- 
necessary myth. In the end the product is scorned 
by science for its overlay of misleading detail, 
and rejected by art for the obnoxious intrusion 
of work-a-day and professional fact. Now, let 
who will believe that such stories and verses are 
a legitimate way of conveying or of illuminating 
scientific fact; but let him not suppose that they 
are literature. The case is different when the 
teacher of fact happens to find in art, in real 
literature, some picture or detail with which to 
emotionalize and beautify his fact. It does some- 
times happen that the poem, the folk-tale, the 
fable, has set in some charming human light 
certain aspects of the object which the children 
are studying. They are entitled to these to help 
them to see their object or event in the round. 
It is true, of course, that no piece of literature 
that handles for its purposes natural objects can 
afford to be flagrantly inaccurate. We all know
-P-A-G-E-182
    174 Literature in the Elementary School 
how neatly John Burroughs punctured Long- 
fellow’s bit of pathos, “There are no birds in last 
year’s nests,” by proving that many species of 
birds devote themselves to securing and occupy- 
ing last year’s nests. But in the main it is truth 
rather than fact that literature gives us—truth, 
or fact colored and interpreted by personal asso- 
ciation and emotion; we must not ask colorless 
fact of her, and it is the most unprofitable quib- 
bling to demand of her scientific exactness, which 
is always prosaic. On the other hand, there is no 
place in nature-study for the imagination of in- 
vention, nor for any of those striking and dra- 
matic effects arranged and calculated, secured by 
manipulation and choice of material—effects 
which are the very native method of literature. 
But writing about animals and objects in 
nature may become literature when, losing sight 
of the need of teaching fact, of giving profes- 
sional instruction, it presents them as personali- 
ties, when it humanizes them, either by attributing 
to them human qualities and feelings, or by sur- 
rounding them: with an atmosphere of human 
emotion and experience; it may become good 
literature when it does these things well; the 
chances are all against its becoming great litera- 
ture at all. 
If the nature-story making use of literary
-P-A-G-E-183
  Nature and Animal Stories 175 
devices, but designed to teach scientific fact, is 
anomalous, the case is no better,- artistically or 
educationally, when the story of an animal is 
made the propaganda of the Humane Society, or 
of the anti-vivisectionists, or of any other believ- 
ers, no matter how just and important may be 
their belief or doctrine. I have known a child 
whose outlook was prejudiced, and whose men- 
tal repose most seriously disturbed, by an over- 
earnest and over-colored story of the sufferings 
of a deserving and phenomenally sensitive cab- 
horse; and this morbid sense of suffering was the 
result of reading a book whose style was com- 
monplace, whose structure was chaotic, whose 
sentiment was melodramatic, and whose psy- 
chology was guesswork—which did not yield, in 
a word, a single one of the desirable fruits of 
literature. We must devise some way to preserve 
and to deepen in our little people that humorous, 
loving sympathy with our furry and _ hairy 
brothers, more wholesome and natural than 
stories of suicidal ponies, revolutionary stallions, 
persecuted partridges, and heart-broken mastiffs. 
Better than any library of books about them is the 
friendship of one dog or horse, or the care of 
any, the humblest, pet. And at least we may 
remind ourselves that we do not have to accom- 
plish the awakening of that or any other sym-  
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 Literature in the Elementary School 
pathy at the cost of teaching as literature stories 
undesirable and inartistic. 
The oldest of beast-tales available for occiden- 
tal children is the story of Reynard the Fox. We 
all know how there grew up about the original 
core of the story a vast accretion of material, 
which became ever more and more satirical and 
abstract, until finally the original folk-cycle was 
buried under it. Of course, in the later forms 
the tales are most unchildlike. But it is not so 
difficult to extract from the cycle the original 
simpler one—or at least to get together a cycle 
which has the simplicity, the sincerity, and the 
objectivity of genuine folk-art. The children 
love the tales, and get so much out of them that 
it is a pity for any child to miss them completely ; 
though I should never advise that many of the 
tales be read to them continuously. To do this 
would be to immerse them in an atmosphere of 
trickery. It is better to keep the story lying by, 
and to read them an episode now and then in the 
intervals of something more serious. Many peo- 
ple will question the moral effect of stories in 
which the rascal uniformly triumphs, as in Rey- 
nard. But I have observed, among the children 
with whom I have read it, that they are never in 
sympathy with Reynard, and are never pleased 
with his triumphs. This is in striking, and in
-P-A-G-E-185
  Nature and Animal Stories 177 
some respects puzzling, contrast with the fact that 
the triumphs and successes of Bre’r Rabbit in 
Uncle Remus always delight the children. The 
tales that Joel Chandler Harris has assembled in 
this collection constitute a most charming and 
usable beast-epic. The universal sympathy with 
this hero may be encouraged and enjoyed with- 
out misgiving, because Bre’r Rabbit succeeds by 
subtlety, where Reynard succeeds by knavery. 
Bre’r Rabbit’s triumphs are those of sheer intel- 
lect, as truely as are those of Odysseus, while 
Reynard’s are those of low and cruel cunning. 
It is impossible to exaggerate the access of charm 
and interest that invest the Uncle Remus stories 
because of Uncle Remus himself. He is the 
genuine folk story-teller, full of faith and sincer- 
ity, yet steeped in humor, and gifted with the 
sense of essential reality; add to this that he is a 
gentle soul, a devoted lover of childhood, with 
a never-failing sense of the reverence due the 
child. While to those who know the negro dialect 
the stories lose much by translation, still they are 
good enough to bear even this test, and such 
translation is necessary for some groups of chil- 
dren. Like the Reynard tales, those of Bre’r 
Rabbit are best inserted here and there through- 
out the year and not read in a mass. 
The fables—all those oriental and classic ones  
-P-A-G-E-186
  178 Literature in the Elementary School 
that are called Aesop’s, as well as many of La 
Fontaine’s—are, from the literary point of view 
the best of the animal stories. Leave quite out 
of view their moralistic and figurative meanings, 
and most of them are sympathetic and dramatic 
presentations of the animals themselves, with 
those wider human implications that make an 
anecdote about an animal literature rather than 
science. The family or the schoolroom that, can 
possess a copy of Boutet de Monvel’s La Fon- 
taine has in the pictures the most charming and 
penetrating criticism and interpretation of the 
fables themselves, of the animals who appear in 
them, and of the motives and experiences that 
lie behind them. 
Scattered throughout the folk-tales and among 
the fairy-stories that we know best are some 
fascinating animal stories. The folk-mind is 
always impressed in an imaginative way with the 
relation between man and the animals—not al- 
ways a loving or sympathetic relation. They feel, 
what the modern writing humanitarian seems to 
have determined to ignore, that deep, psychic, 
inscrutable animosity, be it instinct or race- 
memory or whatever it may be, that has always 
existed between man and the beasts; though there 
are among practically all the folk whose tales 
we have collected, stories of “grateful beasts,”
-P-A-G-E-187
  
Nature and Animal Stories 179 
of friendly and serviceable animals. Then there 
are such classics as The Little Red Hen, 
Henny-Penny, The Three Billy-Goats, and The 
Musicians of Bremen, whose perfection of art as 
stories and as presentations of life is beyond 
criticism. 
The native stories of many of the North 
American Indian tribes have a charming way of 
presenting the animals. Unfortunately, most of 
our Indian folk-lore was collected and reduced 
to literary form in what one may call the blaue 
Blume period of folk-lore collecting, and is spoiled 
everywhere by the oversentimental strain of the 
period. We could well spare an occasional 
account of what one might infer to be a common 
habit of love-lorn Indian maidens—that of cast- 
ing themselves headlong from inaccessible cliffs at 
sunset,—to make room for some of the humorous 
and fanciful tales of the animals that the Indians 
knew so well and to which they lived so near. 
The Zufii folk-tales collected by Frank Cushing 
have much of this element in them, and it con- 
stitutes one of their many charms. 
East Indian folk-lore is peculiarly rich in tales 
of animals—fables, bits of beast-wisdom and 
beast-adventure. It may be that this fact co- 
operated with his own gift to make Rudyard 
Kipling the greatest of all modern makers of 
   
-P-A-G-E-188
  180 Literature in the Elementary School 
animal-stories. The Jungle Books stand unique 
and imperishable as one of the perfect art- 
products of the nineteenth century. Like every- 
thing else that is true art, these stories never be- 
come stale. This gives them a peculiar value. For 
the children who have had them at home are 
always willing to hear them again with the class. 
We can read them fo the third grade for the 
story, and with the sixth grade for the style, and 
the eighth grade is not above hearing Toomai of 
the Elephants at any time. The teacher himself 
will find unfailing satisfaction in them because, 
in addition to all their charms as interpretations 
of the beasts and presentation of human nature, 
they show all the marks of expert workmanship. 
This appears in the masterly structure of the 
story, the organization of the material, the 
economy of incident, the successful style which 
combines in a most unusual way, a reserve and 
finish that would become a literary essayist, with 
a power of vivid and striking phrase that charac- 
terizes the most successful journalist. So that 
teacher and children are both interested and 
disciplined by every reading of the Jungle Books. 
Among all their verse literature, from the 
Mother Goose melodies to Wordsworth in the 
eighth grade, the children will find poems about 
animals. A catalogue of the nursery and
-P-A-G-E-189
Nature and Animal Stories 181 
fairy-book animals is a very instructive document 
—indeed, a catalogue of poetical beasts in gen- 
eral, is very illuminating. All the verses about 
animals that have come down to us in the tradi- 
tionary jingles are good as art and on the whole, 
fair to the animals. ‘Baa, Black Sheep,” “The 
Mouse Ran Up the Clock,” “Johnny Shuter’s 
Mare,” and all the others, yield the fruits of 
literature, but only after much torturing, the 
fruits of science. Gradually to these we add such 
as Cowper’s tame but touching pictures of his 
pets; Wordsworth’s tender and far-seeing poems 
about the shepherds and their flocks, the doe and 
the hart, the pet lamb, the faithful dogs; Blake’s 
wonderful pair of poems, “The Tiger” and “The 
Lamb;” Mary Lamb’s exquisite picture of the 
boy and the snake ; Emerson’s “The Bumble Bee;” 
those splendid imaginative characterizations of the 
beasts from the thirty-eighth to the forty-first 
chapters of Job; “The Jackdaw of Rheims;” 
“How They Brought the Good News.” Why 
extend the actual list? They are all things that 
place the animals which appear in them in their 
romantic or tender relations to human beings, or 
interpret in a dramatic and literary way the 
imaginary consciousness of the animal. 
There is little danger of making poetry that 
is good enough to be given as poetry, do the work
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 Literature in the Elementary School 
of information-teaching. It seems easy to see in 
the case of the poem, with its more imaginative 
method and its more artificial form, that you 
spoil it as art when you teach it as science. This 
fact is equally true of a good literary story. 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  CHAPTER XI 
SYMBOLISTIC STORIES, FABLES, AND OTHER 
APOLOGUES 
It is not possible, in the plan adopted for this 
little book, to keep the topics always strictly 
apart. It is not possible, for example, to relegate 
to one section all one has to say about folk- and 
fairy-stories, and to another all about fables, 
because each type has so many aspects and radia- 
tions. Fables are stories; most of them are ani- 
mal-stories; they are symbolistic or figurative or 
allegorical—so that one must approach them 
from many points of view, and take them into 
consideration in many connections. There need 
be, therefore, no apology for taking up in this 
new section topics partially discussed elsewhere. 
It seems quite consonant with our best conclu- 
sions about younger children to say that, on the 
whole, in the earlier years of their school life 
their literature should be of that objective kind 
here no more is meant than meets the eye. 
hey may have tales of adventure, of plain experi- 
nce, of highly imaginative experience, of animal 
ife, of fairyland; but as far as possible let them 
such as contain no occult and secondary mean- 
183     
      
    
   
    
   
   
   
   
-P-A-G-E-192
  184 Literature in the Elementary School 
ings. There are many things desirable for all 
children, and under certain school conditions com- 
pulsory or indispensable for some children, 
which do have this secondary meaning. Such, if 
one uses them, are the stories from the great 
myths; such are practically all of Andersen’s Mar- 
chen; such are the legendary stories of the Hebrew 
patriarchs. Of course, the parent or teacher who 
presents these things to his children may say that 
the children never perceive or even suspect an 
inner meaning. And it is true that, with great 
care and skill, the objective upper surface may be 
kept before some children. But, on the whole, it 
is good morality and good pedagogy to give to 
the children nothing that you are not willing, even 
desirous, that they should probe to the bottom. 
It is always a misfortune when one must say to a 
child, “I can’t explain that to you now;” “You 
can’t understand that yet;” so much a misfortune 
that no teacher should ever invite it. If you have 
ever looked into the faces of the fifth grade when 
they were searching you with questions to get at 
the meaning of Andersen’s pessimistic story of 
The Little White Hen; if you have seen the sixth 
grade grow melancholy, with a vague augury of 
trouble they could not fathom, when you have 
read to them the brilliant but tragic little apologue 
of Mr. Seguin’s Goat; if you have been obliged
-P-A-G-E-193
  
  Symbolistic Stories, Fables, etc. 185 
to explain to some puzzled and suspicious eight- 
year-old the raison d’étre of the clock-ticking 
alligator in Peter Pan, you have resolved here- 
after to give them no symbolism, or to give them 
symbolism whose presence they could not possibly 
suspect (a most difficult thing to do in the case 
of that many-minded, hundred-eyed child, the 
class), or to give such symbolism as would invite 
them into paths where you would gladly have 
them walk, whose most ultimate implication you 
are at least willing to explain to them. Of course, 
this principle cannot be pushed to its logical 
extreme; merely logical extremes are always 
absurd. One does not go into the philosophical 
depths of the special historical epoch he chooses 
for his children, nor does he instruct them in the 
remote scientific principles behind their window- 
garden or their aquarium of polywogs and sala- 
manders. But, if he is wise, he hopes to choose 
such work, and present such aspects of it, as con- 
tain no insoluble mystery, and do not tempt the 
children into paths for which their feet are not 
ready. 
So, when one is choosing literature it is very 
easy to fill all the time the children have for it 
in the first four or five years of school with 
things that are largely objective, and that, so far 
as their large framework goes, mean just what
-P-A-G-E-194
  186 Literature in the Elementary School 
they say. Indeed, will not most modern teachers 
concede that throughout the period and in all his 
subjects it is for the mental good of the child not 
to be called upon too frequently to formulate prin- 
ciples, or habitually to look below the surface of 
his facts for interpretations and secondary mean- 
ings? Of course, he must be led by the natural 
stages to see through figures of speech, and to 
understand and apply proverbs, and the proverbial 
manner of speech. 
Proverbs, indeed, exemplify and epitomize the 
essentially literary type of thinking and speaking. 
They are concrete and picturesque rather than 
abstract, specific rather than general, though we 
are to understand by them also the abstract and 
the general; this is the fact that gives them 
their unique value as literary training. The 
teacher must call upon his wisdom in choosing 
proverbs suitable for the children. Many proverbs 
are pessimistic, even cynical: “It never rains but it 
pours ;” many embody a merely commonplace or 
unmoral code: “Honesty is the best policy; some 
are ambiguous: “There’s honor among thieves ;” 
some the modern world has outgrown; many are 
too mature, too occult, or too worldly for a child. 
But a great store remains—vivid, practical bits of 
experience and tested wisdom which will develop 
a child’s mental quickness, will do something
-P-A-G-E-195
  Symbolistic Stories, Fables, etc. 187 
toward equipping him with the common wisdom 
of his race, and will accustom him to one of the 
most characteristic methods of literature. This 
is a good place to say that good results never 
seem to come of asking the children for an expo- 
sition of the proverb. Indeed, it is extremely 
difficult to get from children an exposition or 
definition of any kind. The better way of mak- 
ing sure that they have appropriated a proverb is 
to ask them to invent or re-call an incident or a 
situation to which the proverb will apply. Natu- 
rally this is not an exercise for the youngest chil- 
dren. 
In the earlier years a great many of the simple 
old fables may be taught. One is tempted to say 
that the traditionary or given moral should never 
be told to the children; but that is a little too 
sweeping. As a rule, however, it is better to lead 
them to make their own interpretation or general- 
ization, in those cases where such a thing is de- 
sired. For, as a matter of fact, many of the 
fables are so good as stories that they may often 
be left to stand merely as pleasant tales. 
But as the children grow more penetrating, 
the fable is the best possible form of symbolistic 
literature to set them at first. These, with the 
minor exercise in the apprehension and interpre- 
tation of figures of speech, will be their share of 
   
-P-A-G-E-196
  188 Literature in the Elementary School 
the symbolistic kind of writing for several years. 
Then we may introduce more specimens, and 
more complex specimens, until in the sixth- and 
seventh-grade periods they may be able to inter- 
pret the universal and symbolic side of much that 
they read, and to handle with ease and delight 
such parables as The Great Stone Face or The 
Bee-Man of Orn. Their experience in litera- 
ture will then harmonize with their experi- 
ence in other directions; for they should then, 
or immediately afterward, be beginning to look 
for generalizations, to carry abstract symbols, and 
to substitute them at will for concrete matter. 
At the same time, then, they will study these 
fables as apologues, making in all cases their own 
moral and application. 
Perhaps this is the place to insert a caution 
against the practice of extracting a “deeper 
meaning” out of a child when he does not easily 
see it, or of so instructing him that he comes to 
regard every story that he reads as a sort of pic- 
ture puzzle in which he is to find a “concealed 
robber” in the shape of a moral or a general les- 
son. It is a trivial habit of mind, a pernicious 
critical obsession, of which many over-earnest 
adult readers are victims—that of wringing from 
every and any bit of writing an abstract or moral- 
istic meaning. Another practical caution may be
-P-A-G-E-197
  
Symbolistic Stories, Fables, etc. 189 
needed as to these interpretations: Do not leave 
the discussion until the class has worked out from 
the fable a moral or application that practically 
the whole class accepts and the teacher indorses. 
Do not accept numerous guesswork explanations 
and let them pass. Even the little children, if 
they are allowed to interpret at all, should be 
pushed on and guided to a sound and essential 
exegesis—to use a term more formidable than 
the thing it names. Do not let them linger even 
tentatively in that lamentable state of making 
their explanation rest upon some minor detail, 
some feature on the outskirts of the story. Help 
them always to go to the center, and to make the 
essential interpretation. Make a point of this 
whenever they have a story that calls for inter- 
pretation at all. To the end that they may be 
sincere and thorough, choose those things whose 
secondary meanings they may as children feel and 
understand. The sixth-grade children could, in 
most schools, interpret The Ugly Ducking. They 
may easily be led into the inner significance of 
The Bee-Man of Orn or Old Pipes and the Dryad. 
They may go on in seventh grade to certain of 
Hawthorne’s—perhaps “The Great Stone Face” 
and others of the Twice Told Tales; though 
Hawthorne is so sombre and so moralistic that it is 
not good for some children to read his tales, stil! 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 Literature in the Elementary School 
less to linger over them and interpret them. A 
mature and experienced eighth grade could study 
“The Snow Image’’; but it is too delicate and re- 
mote for all eighth-grade classes. “The Minister’s 
Black Veil” is an example of the peculiar Haw- 
thornesque gloom, which the children would not 
understand or by ill luck would understand, and 
suffer the consequent dangerous depression. Ad- 
dison’s “The Vision of Mirza” is an example of a 
standard little allegory, simple and easy, and at 
the same time full of meaning and fruitful of 
reflection for the children. The parables of the 
gospels are quite unique in their beauty and 
ethical significance, and afford an opportunity for 
a most valuable kind of training in literary exe- 
gesis. Certain tales from the Gesta Romanorum 
might be read in these older grades, adding the 
interpretations of the ecclesiastics for the gaiety 
of the class, and as a terrible warning against 
wresting an allegory out of a story by sheer 
violence. 
There are several reasons why the extended 
allegories do not yield good results with a class. 
In the first place, it takes too long to get through 
them, so that the process keeps the children too 
long in an atmosphere of allegorical and sym- 
bolistic meanings, which will confuse and baffle 
them. In the second place, all the extended liter- 
   
-P-A-G-E-199
  Symbolistic Stories, Fables, etc. 191 
ary allegories have each behind it a complex sys- 
tem of abstract theology or morals, or some other 
philosophy, which cannot be conveyed to children, 
but which cannot be hidden from the class. 
Then in any long allegory, such as The Pilgrim’s 
Progress or The Fairie Queene, the multiplied 
detail all loaded with secondary significance is 
extremely misleading to all but expert readers. 
As Ruskin says of myth, we may say of all other 
allegory: the more it means, the more numerous 
and the more grotesque do the details become. 
And we would not choose in a child’s literary 
training any large mass of material in which 
grotesqueness is a prevailing note. Nearly all 
children are interested in The Pilgrim’s Progress, 
and will listen with eagerness to the romantic 
and adventurous side of Christian’s experience, 
but not, of course, to the didactic and theological 
passages. And as a matter of fact, modern reli- 
gious teaching and the new race-consciousness of 
our generation have taken all sense of reality out 
of Bunyan’s theology and religious psychology ; 
and of course, it can be read to the modern child 
only cursorily, as in the home—never in detail 
and with the privilege of questioning as in the 
class. 
One would expect a really good eighth-grade 
child to be able to detect and express the lesson
-P-A-G-E-200
  192 Literature in the Elementary School 
in Lowell’s The Vision of Sir Launfal, or Tenny- 
son’s Sir Galahad, or Longfellow’s King Robert 
of Sicily. It need hardly be said that the exercises 
in the symbolistic kinds of literature are to be 
inserted here and there among the other lessons. 
It would be a serious mistake to give any class 
a whole year—or a whole month, indeed—of this 
experience in reading. |
-P-A-G-E-201
  CHAPTER XII 
POETRY 
There are certain results in literary training 
that can be secured with children only by the 
teaching of poetry. In story we and they are 
intent upon subject-matter, and on the larger 
matters of the imaginative creation. And, while 
we older students know that the choice and 
arrangement of material involved in the making 
of a story are extremely important and most 
truly educative, we also know that they belong 
in the larger framework of the story and do not 
lend themselves to close inspection or detailed 
study when our scholars are elementary children. 
Again, most of the stories best suited to the 
children must be used in translated and adapted 
versions, and all of them should be told in a way 
that varies more or less from telling to telling, 
in vocabulary, in figure, and occasionally in 
material detail. As a result, the stories, until 
we come down to the very last year of the 
period, make on the children no impression 
of the inevitableness of form, or of any of the 
smaller devices of style and finish. These 
may be brought to bear in verse. It should not 
193 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  194 Literature in the Elementary School 
be necessary to say again that the children will 
know nothing of “larger effects” and “smaller 
details ;” but the teacher should know them, and 
should have some plan that will include both in 
his teaching. Neither is it necessary to say that 
these minor matters of style and finish that we 
will pause over with our elementary class will 
prove to be very simple matters from the point 
of view of the expert and adult critic. 
\ dtis-verse that gives the child most experi- 
ence in the musical side of literature. The 
rhythm and cadence of prose have their own 
music—perhaps more delicate and pleasing to 
the trained adult ear than the rhythm of verse. 
But the elementary children need the simple strik- 
ing rhythm of verse, of verse whose rhythm is 
quite unmistakable. Indeed, it is profitable in 
the first verses that children learn to have an 
\ emphatic meter, so that the musical intention may 
not be missed, and that it may be possible easily 
to accompany the recitation of the verses with 
_ movement, even concerted movement as of clap- 
* ping or marching. One who is trying to write a 
sober treatise in a matter-of-fact way dares not, 
lest he be set down as the veriest mystic, say all the 
things that might be said about the function of 
rhythm, especially in its more pronounced form 
of meter, among a community of children, no
-P-A-G-E-203
  Poetry 195 
matter what the size of the group—how rhythmic 
motion, or the flow of measured and beautiful 
sounds, harmonizes their differences, tunes them 
up to their tasks, disciplines their conduct, com- 
forts their hurts, quiets their nerves; all this apart 
from the facts more or less important from the 
point of view of literature, that it cultivates their 
ear, improves their taste, and provides them a 
genuinely artistic pleasure. If it happens that the 
sounds they are chanting be a bit of real poetry. 
it further gives them perhaps more than one 
charming image, and many pleasant or useful 
words. 
Most children are pleased with the additional 
\ music of rhyme. This is true of all kinds of 
rhyme, but of course it is the regular terminal 
rhyme that most children notice and enjoy and 
remember.

all the children will rejoice in rye—pie. But 
there will be some to whom sing—song—six- 
pence—pocket, full—four, blackbirds—baked, 
are so many delights, and there may be some to 
whom the wonderful chime of the vowels will 
make music. Anyone who knows children will  
-P-A-G-E-204
  196 Literature in the Elementary School 
have noticed the pleasure that the merest plies 
will take in beautiful or especially pat collocations 
of syllables. A child whom I knew, just begin- 
ning to talk, would say to himself many times a 
day, and always with a smile of amused pleasure, 
the phrases “apple-batter pudding,” “picallilli 
pickles,” “up into the cherry tree.’ “piping down 
the valleys wild.” It is probably true that some 
of his apparent pleasure was that species of hys- 
teria produced in most babies by any mild explo- 
sion, and the little fusillade of p’s in the examples 
he liked best would acount for a part of his 
enjoyment. But we must think that there was 
pleasure there, and, whether it were physical or 
mental, it arose from the pleasing combination 
of verbal sounds. Most children have this 
r for the music of words; and some attempt 
ould be made to evoke it in those that have 
not. ] 
This quality, then, is the first thing we ask of 
the verse we choose for the youngest children. 
The mere jingles, provided they are really 
musical, are useful to emphasize this side of verse, 
because, being free from content, they can give 0? 46 
themselves entirely to sound. It is also most 
  ~{é desirable that some of these earliest verses be set 
© to music that the children can sing; that the class 
march to the rhythm of recited verses; that they 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  Poetry 197 
be taught, if possible, to dance to some of them. 
Some such form of accompaniment of the verses, 
deepens the impression of the music, records in 
the child’s consciousness an impression of the 
poem as an image of motion, and opens a channel 
for the expression of the mood produced in the 
children by the verses—a more acceptable channel 
of expression, certainly, for all the lyrics and for 
most of the narrative verses, than mere recitation, 
and a more artistic one than what we commonly 
know and dread as elocution. 
The teaching of verse gives a chance and an 
invitation to linger over and enjoy many fine and 
delicate aspects of the art that we are likely to 
miss in the story. Something in the nature of 
verse—the condensation, the careful arrange- 
ment, the chosen words—seems to call upon us 
to go slowly with it. It may be that we linger 
to apprehend one by one the details of an image 
or picture, like— 
Daffy-down dilly has come up to town 
In a yellow petticoat and a green gown, 
The captain was a duck, with a packet on his back; 
The cattle are grazing, 
Their heads never raising, 
There are forty feeding like one; 
In the pool drowse the cattle up to their knees, 
The crows fly over by twos and threes;
-P-A-G-E-206
  198 Literature in the Elementary School 
some apt or beautiful phrase— 
Snowy summits old in story; 
some bit of simple wisdom that deserves ponder- 
ing; some flash of wit or epigram, or enticing 
touch of nonsense. 
These are really about all that we would pause 
over in teaching verses to the younger children. 
Indeed, are not/ these elements about all of what 
we call the smaller matters of literary art that ele- 
mentary children may be expected to concern 
themselves with—the music of the spoken verse, 
appreciation of the beauty or adequacy of striking 
pictures and images, recognition of some specially 
fit epithet, interpretation of an-aphorism or a par- 
adox or a bit of nonsense? We will discuss later 
some possible ways of getting these things done. 
When we say that a poem gives us our best 
chance to study these finer details, we should not 
by any means understand that in teaching a poem 
we are to, ignore the other matter of plan and 
structure. The very condensation and beautiful 
organization of a poem are likely to result in a 
charming plan, which both adds to the children’s 
sense of its beauty and helps to fix it in their 
memory. Every teacher will notice—merely to 
mention examples—the perfect structure, what 
we have called the “pattern,” of Stevenson’s
-P-A-G-E-207
Poetry 199 
“Dark brown is the river,” of Allingham’s “I 
wish I were a primrose,’ of Wordsworth’s, “I 
heard a thousand blended notes;” and every 
teacher will realize the greater class utility of a 
poem with such a structure. 
The kinds of poetry suitable by virtue of their 
content for the children throughout the whole ele- 
mentary period ar¢ first, lyrics of the simpler 
varieties, beginning with those which are practi- 
cally only jingles, and going on to those that are 
more complex in form and more mature in 
thought, but which still record, as it were, the 
first reaction of the mind, the primary mood, not 
the complex and remote moods of developed lyric 
poetry; and second, poetry of the epic kind, 
beginning with the Mother Goose ballads, and 
advancing to the objective heroic ballads in which 
English literature is so rich, and perhaps (un- 
doubtedly in certain schools) including some of 
the longer narrative poems of the type of idyls. 
It is clear to most teachers that the less 
the earlier lyrics say, the better. The simplicity 
of the content makes it possible to empha- 
size all the more the music and the motion. As 
the lyrics increase in content, and as we begin to 
expect the children to enter into the mood which 
their poem reflects, it becomes important to select 
such as record a mood or an experience which 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  200 Literature in the Elementary School 
they can apprehend or might legitimately we 
hend. Luckily, in our day it is no longer neces- 
sary to remonstrate against what one may almost 
call the crime of requiring children to study and 
to return “The Barefoot Boy,” “Still sits the 
schoolhouse by the road,” “I remember, I remem- 
ber the house where I was born”—adult reminis- 
cence of childhood, which is undoubtedly the 
most alien of moods and processes to the child. 
But we are likely to be caught by the apparent 
simplicity of certain verses which, written after 
the pattern of A Child’s Garden—indeed, the 
class includes some of these very poems—record 
feelings about children and childhood. These 
verses, like some of the delightful stories and 
studies mentioned in a previous chapter are 
studies and realizations of the child’s con- 
sciousness calculated to delight and illuminate 
the adult reader. If children read and under- 
stood them, the result would be that ghastly 
spectacle—a child conscious of his own child- 
hood. 
No poetry given to children should be too 
‘imaginative, too figurative, or too emotional. 
Here, to be sure, one must judge afresh for each 
class. It is obvious that children of the eighth 
grade can apprehend a poem that would bewilder 
the sixth; that children in one community, even  
-P-A-G-E-209
Poetry 201 
mm one neighborhood, will understand a poem 
which children of a different community and up- 
bringing could not fathom. But the standard is, 
after all, not infinitely variable. A good average 
seventh grade almost anywhere would appreciate 
without difficulty, including the spiritual applica- 
tion, Tennyson’s “Bugle Song;” they could not 
find their way among the many figures and the 
alien imaginative mood, the poignant unknown 
emotion, of “Tears, idle tears.” 
It is not easy to go wrong in choosing the bal- 
lads. And by “ballads” we are to understand 
the short narrative poem, traditionary or artistic. 
The folk-ballads need translation here and there, 
and are scarcely available at all for the youngest 
children. But those who are old enough to hear 
the Robin Hood tales will enjoy the folk-ballads, 
if the teacher take pains to prepare them and read 
them aright. As in the case of some of the heroic 
epics, some editing is necessary for most of the 
ballads. They should be given in the “say and 
sing,” manner, turning the duller or the link por- 
tions into prose narrative, and reading the excit- 
ing and beautiful passages in the original form. 
Even this accommodated form of the folk-ballads 
may prove impossible in some classes. There are 
ballads ideal for the grades in nearly all the 
modern poets—Cowper, Scott, Wordsworth, 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  202 Literature in the Elementary School 
Campbell, Browning, Longfellow, Whittier, ye 
ling. 
It is not so easy to choose for elementary chil. 
dren among the longer narrative poems. As a 
matter of fact, a great number of them are of the 
idyllic kind, and there is in this class of poems 
something soft and meditative, or over-emotional 
and, if one must say it—sentimental or super- 
romantic, that fits them for the comprehension of 
older readers, and spoils them for the children. 
Others, such as Scott’s narrative poems, are too 
long and a bit too difficult for children younger 
than the high-school age. Here and there one 
finds a poem, like ‘Paul Revere’s Ride,” really 
more ballad than tale; a tender simple tale like 
“King Robert of Sicily,” for a mature eighth 
grade. “The Vision of Sir Launfal;” not for- 
getting Morris’ The Man Born to Be King, 
“The Fostering of Auslag,” and perhaps other: 
things from The Earthly Paradise. The simple 
but lofty style and feeling of “Sohrab and 
Rustum” makes it possible for the older children. 
Any teacher who knows both literature and 
children will see at once what it is that constitutes 
the fitness of these poems, and what the unfitness 
of “Enoch Arden,” “The Courtship of Miles 
Standish,” or “Lancelot and Elaine.” 
Perhaps the only library of literature that is  
-P-A-G-E-211
  Poetry 203 
perfectly suited to its purpose and its public, and 
the only collection of masterpieces to be put into 
the hands of its readers without misgiving, is the 
nursery rhymes that we call Mother Goose's 
Melodies. It needs no more general praise, and 
there is no room for specifications. But it is 
always in order to urge teachers in this case, as 
in that of the fairy-tales, to increase their knowl- 
edge of those traditionary bits of art. When one 
knows their origin and something of their social 
and literary history, they take on new dignity 
and importance. One ceases to look upon them 
as mere nonsense to be rattled off for the amuse- 
ment of the baby, and learns to see them as little 
treasures of primitive art, miraculously preserved 
and passed down from baby to baby through these 
many generations: bits of old song and ballad, 
games and charms, riddles and incantations, tales 
of charming incidents and episodes—a gallery of 
unmatchable portraits, sallies of wit just witty 
enough for the four-year-old, mild but adequate 
nonsense; all freed by the lapse of years and the 
innocence of its devotees from every taint of 
utilitarianism and occasionalism, winnowed and 
tested by the generations of mothers and babies 
that have criticized them, they yield a new charm 
at every fresh reading to the most experienced 
reader. They should constitute the first literary
-P-A-G-E-212
  204 Literature in the Elementary School 
material of every English-speaking child. Bheny 
well-nurtured child will come to school already 
in possession of many of them. But he will be 
glad to go over them for the sake of those less 
fortunate, as well as for the sake of enjoying 
them with the whole community, and in consid- 
eration of the new pictures, games, and songs 
that will be joined with them. 
Stevenson’s A Child’s Garden of Verses is in 
some sense a quite unique poetic production; and 
this remains true in spite of the many things pro- 
duced in imitation of it and inspired by it. It is 
a wonderful example of the recovery by a grown 
person of the thread of continuity leading him 
back to actual childhood; the recovery, too, in 
many instances of the child’s consciousness. It 
is the gate for us all to the lost garden of our own 
childhood, pathetic in every line with the evanes- 
cence of childhood, “whose hand is ever at his 
lips, bidding adieu.” 
Yet in spite of this most poignant appeal to 
the grown-up person, many of the verses are 
ideally suited to children. They do not induce in 
them our mood of pathos and regret, nor do they 
set their child-readers imaginatively in another 
experience. They do very really constitute, as 
Stevenson suggests, a window through which the 
child sees 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  Poetry 205 
Another child far, far away, 
And in another garden, play; 
a child with whom he tenderly sympathizes, at 
whom he lovingly smiles, at whose games he 
looks on, whose toys and books he knows and 
loves. 
The Child in the Garden is an only child, a 
lonely child, and a very individualistic child; 
there is no comradeship in the verses; they can- 
not be becomingly recited in concert; there is not 
a chorus or a refrain in the whole book, in which 
all the children may join; there is nothing 
communal about them. In spite of all the efforts, 
they cannot be set to music, except as solos; and 
if the music matches the mood, it is likely to be 
difficult for a child to sing. Several of them are 
too imaginative—“Windy Nights,” “Shadow 
March;” some are a bit ironic—“Good and Bad 
Children,” “System,” “A Happy Thought;” 
some too poignantly pathetic—‘‘The Land of 
Nod;” some look at childhood too obviously with 
the man’s eyes—“Keepsake Mill; but all these 
exceptions leave many altogether suitable for chil- 
dren; and their perfect structure, their musical 
verse-form, their childlike objectivity, and the 
divine simplicity of their style render them an 
unceasing delight. 
Though the Child of the Garden was a soli-
-P-A-G-E-214
  206 Literature in the Elementary School 
tary child, he had a constantly haunting sense of 
the world beyond—other children in other lands, 
the foreign countries he might see by climbing 
higher, the children who would bring his boats 
ashore far down the river, the children singing 
in far Japan, the long-ago Egyptian boys, hints 
at the wider experience and bigger world to which 
the six- and seven-year-old children are so eagerly 
reaching out. At the same time nobody but 
Stevenson—nobody at least, that has written a 
book—has ever taken adequately the point of view 
of the human being three feet high—his tiny hori- 
zon, the small exquisite objects to which he comes 
close, the fairy-dells he sees, the rain-pool sea, 
the clover tree; nowhere else in art is the little 
world of the little people adequately pictured—- 
the little world, and its obverse, the colossal 
grown-ups, with their elephantine furniture 
amidst which the little men and women must 
ordinarily move. 
Many of these poems should be read with the 
single child at home. For the class at school we 
may use “Foreign Lands,” “Singing,” “Where 
Go the Boats,” “My Shadow,” “The Swing,” 
“My Ship and I’—the more objective and uni- 
versal of them. 
There are many pretty bits for the youngest 
children in Christina Rossetti’s Sing-Song—a
-P-A-G-E-215
  Poetry 207 
book of nursery rhymes not sufficiently known. 
Certain of Blake’s Songs of Innocence the chil- 
dren should know, though they are always found 
too delicate and contemplative for the whole class. 
Every teacher of children should know for his 
own enlightenment the poems of Jane and Ann 
Taylor, and Dr. Watts’s Poems for Infant 
Minds. Psychologically speaking, they are in a 
world completely alien to the modern student of 
children and of education; but there is a stray 
verse or two like “The Violet” or “How doth 
the little busy bee,” that may some day fit the 
needs of the class. Every friend of children, 
teacher or parent, should know Keble’s Lyra 
Innocentium; he cannot afford to miss the tone 
and atmosphere of Wordsworth’s poems about 
children and childhood. As a matter of fact, it is 
only a few of Wordsworth’s poems that will go 
well for class study, though a really enthusiastic 
teacher may carry even a large class through 
“The Idle Shepherd Boys” or “The Blind High- 
land Boy;”’ the older children should know 
“Heartleap Well” and “Peter Bell.” The true 
Wordsworthian is born, only occasionally made; 
if he declares himself in a class in elementary 
school, the teacher should guide him. 
But we should soon learn, and aways remem- 
ber, that the contemplative and idyllic lyric, how-   
-P-A-G-E-216
  208 Literature in the Elementary School 
ever it may delight the chosen child and the adult, 
will, as a rule, neither please nor train the class, 
andthat poems written for children and about chil- 
dren are not at all likely to be the things children 
love best and most profit by; the poetry should 
not linger long in the nursery stage. The class 
should be pushed on as early as possible into 
simple but heroic ballads, into lyrics, musical and 
noble, but simple and easy as to content—all 
chosen from the great poets. 
Even if one desired it, it would probably be 
impossible to dislodge Hiawatha from its shrine 
in American elementary schools; and no one 
ought to covet the task, for the iconoclast is likely 
to be set down as a vulgar and egotistic person. 
Hiawatha has become entrenched in the schools 
by some such reasoning as this: Here is a poem 
written by an American on aspects of life among 
the American aborigines; American children 
should study it as literature. Children ought to 
be instructed in primitive life and in myth; there- 
fore they should study Hiawatha as literature. 
Children should learn much about nature and 
should learn nature-poetry ; therefore they should 
study Hiawatha as literature. 
Of course, there are pretty things in Hiawatha. 
Some of the passages about the forest and the 
waters, the making of the canoe, the conquest of  
-P-A-G-E-217
  Poetry 209 
Mondanim, the picture-writing, may most profit- 
ably be interwoven with other things. It is 
instructive both as to literature and as to fact to 
put the making of Robinson Crusoe’s boat beside 
the building of Hiawatha’s canoe. But there are 
objections to a long and exclusive course in this 
poem. The mythical side of it is baffling and dis- 
couraging. Once more let me say that a class is 
an extremely acute and inquiring personality; 
after a few days it “wants to know.” And it is 
puzzled and dismayed, and finally frightened off, 
by the fact that everything means something else. 
Furthermore, the details both of Indian life and 
of Indian belief are so chosen and sifted and 
beautified as to be most misleading, if we are 
emphasizing that side of the poem. Lastly, 
it is not good for the young children to have a 
long-continued and constantly renewed experi- 
ence in the alien and, wearing meter, and the 
unmusical rhythm of Hiawatha; and the verse- 
form dictates certain trying peculiarities of style, 
in especial the slightly varied iteration of detail : 
Ah, my brother from the North land, 
From the kingdom of Wabasso, 
From the land of the White Rabbit, 
You have stolen the maiden from me, 
You have laid your hand upon her, 
You have wooed and won my maiden.
-P-A-G-E-218
  210 Literature in the Elementary School 
This redundancy and repetition do not constitute 
the direct, forward-moving style we should like 
to impress on the children. All these considera- 
tions are offered to justify the judgment, held 
in great modesty, that Hiawatha should not be 
given in its entirety nor should the children be 
kept at it for any long drill, but, if at all, in 
chosen episodes and from time to time. 
Of course, any teacher may see fit to draw out 
from Hiawatha the story of any episode and treat 
it as a story, for dramatization, or as illuminat- 
ing some phase of the children’s interest and 
activity. And students old enough to interpret 
the mythical meaning of the poem may profitably 
read it. 
Occasionally, and as something apart from 
their regular lessons, the children should hear 
beautifully read passages of the incomparable 
music of some of the great masters, regardless of 
their understanding of the content—the first six- 
teen lines of Paradise Lost; some especially 
musical sonnet of Shakespeare’s, or some passage 
of lofty eloquence from the plays; some vague 
and haunting bit of music from Shelley, or Poe, 
or Keats; some fanfare of trumpets from Byron, 
or Macaulay, or Kipling. 
Every teacher will realize that all the titles and 
authors and kinds mentioned in this study oe 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  Poetry 211 
not be put into the children’s lessons. It is to be 
hoped that he will realize that they are men- 
tioned as concrete examples, or suggestive in- 
stances of things that are good, and to support 
the principles under discussion. 
The distinctive service of poetry will be the 
cultivation of the children’s sense of the musical 
side of literature; the opportunity for appreciat- 
ing some of the minor beauties of the literary art; 
and among the older children, acquaintance with 
the more highly imaginative method, and the 
more intensely emotional moods.
-P-A-G-E-220
CHAPTER XIII 
DRAMA 
There are many of the elements of drama that 
are eminently serviceable in the child’s literary 
and artistic training. One cannot use the word 
“elements” in this connection without explaining 
that the word as used here does not designate 
absolutely simple and primitive things. They are 
elements only with respect to the complex whole 
which we call a drama. The elements of drama 
are story, plot, character, impersonation, dialogue, 
gesture, stage requirements ; add to these the mat- 
ter of literary expression, a pronounced structure 
which divides the production into clearly dis- 
tinguished parts or acts; and add the further 
fact that in all its developed and typical speci- 
mens drama is the expression and presentation 
of a complex social situation, or the vehicle of a 
mature philosophy. It is quite evident, then, that 
the fully constituted literary drama will be both 
too complex and two difficult for children under > 
twelve, and in most communities for any ele- 
mentary children. 
But the elements of drama are not of necessity 
always in the difficult and elaborate combination 
212
-P-A-G-E-221
  Drama 213 
which constitutes a literary drama. They appear 
singly and in simpler combinations here and 
there in many of the experiences and occupations 
of the child. They may be selected and combined 
for him in such products as will secure for him 
the distinctive joys and discipline of the drama. 
For example, there is the element of gesture, 
which in its elaborated form becomes techni- . 
cal acting. In its primitive and fundamental form 
it is instinctive with children—well-nigh purpose- 
less at first, uncontrolled and fantastic like the 
early activities of their imagination, but easily 
organized and directed toward a purpose. The 
first step in this direction is the game. Some of 
the charming group-games the children learn 
even in the kindergarten are genuine dra- 
matic art. Such games are, at any rate, the first 
opportunity to channel and to turn into something 
like artistic expression the children’s ceaseless 
activity. 
We have all learned to appreciate the social 
and physical value of play. We may well add 
now a respectful estimate of games as art. The 
group-game may seem at first glance far from 
the child’s literary training; but, as a matter of 
fact, a good game which has in it, as a good game 
always has, an orderly process and a climax, is 
just such an artistic whole as a story. Besides,
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 Literature in the Elementary School 
many of our best group-games are accompanied 
by a rhythmic chant, often by pretty or quaint 
verses, such as “Itisket, itasket, a green and 
yellow basket ;” or, “How many miles to Baby- 
lon?” or “London bridge is falling down.” Act- 
ing upon this hint, we may substitute for these 
verses more artistic lines, or we can furnish more 
artistic lines with the fitting game. And these 
activities, channeled and disciplined by the group- 
game, are receiving the best possible training for 
dramatic acting by and by. 
We must consider dancing as a form of dra- 
matic gesture, and as a training for it. We may 
Il rejoice in the current change of attitude 
toward dancing, which bids fair to replace it in 
education and among the arts. We are learning 
again to regard it as such a controlling and 
refining of motion as makes an appeal to one’s 
sense of beauty, not as the vulgar, one might 
almost say sordid, accomplishment it has been 
in average society for many generations. The 
rediscovery of the charming and simple folk- 
dances has given us a new art for the chil- 
dren, which we may substitute for the un- 
natural waltz, and the mongrel two-step we have 
been teaching them for years. A dance is a 
medium for expressing a mood, and a means of 
communicating it; like the games, it is a method
-P-A-G-E-223
  Drama 215 
of channeling and training activity. From this 
point of view one may see its two-fold relation: 
on the one hand, to the child’s natural activities, 
taking them up, selecting among them, and com- 
bining them into a beautiful whole; on the other 
hand to dramatic acting, training and controlling 
the physical movements of gesture and pose and 
poise. Ideally it may have a closer connection 
with literature. Not only may dancing reflect a 
mood; it may tell a story or present a situation; 
many primitive dances were of this kind. Ina 
previous chapter I have spoken of dancing as a 
method of motion to accompany spoken verse, as 
a means of deepening the sense of rhythm. It is 
possible to represent in this way, not only the 
movement of the words, but the mood of the lyric, 
and, mutatis mutandis, the events of the ballad. 
I have seen the fourth-year class present a little 
dance of “Hickory dickory dock” invented for 
them by their teacher, and another class a little 
older do a humorous dance of “There was a man 
in our town,” than which two performances 
nothing could be more charming. Of course, these 
were not in any sense reproductions of the actions 
suggested by the jingles; there was no gesture 
that told of running up the clock, or scratching 
out his eyes; that would be the business of the old 
gesticulating elocution so deplorable in the arti-
-P-A-G-E-224
  
216 Literature in the Elementary School 
ficiality of its would-be realism. The dances were 
felt to be merely the active response to the rhythm 
and the mood of the recited words—bits of dra- 
matic tone-color, as it were. rf 
One wonders why all teachers do not make a 
game of “Charades” a frequent class recreation 
and discipline, since it has in it so many elements 
of educational value—the contributions to the 
children’s vocabulary, the sugar-coated persuasion 
to attend to spelling, the frequent need for the 
invention of dialogue, the sharpening of every- 
body’s wits, and, best of all, the call for signifi- 
cant pantomime, genuine dramatic gesture, and 
the fun, which is always educative. 
When we come to the element of impersona- 
tion, we are nearer the heart of dramatic art, and 
perhaps deeper into the circle of the child’s inter- 
ests and instincts as well. Imitation is one of the 
absolute and fundamental aspects of a child’s 
activities. It is impossible to escape calling it an 
instinct, when one sees that it is deeper and more 
universal than any impulse or tendency. The in- 
terpretation put by more recent psychologists upon 
the term and the fact of imitation throws a new 
and grateful light upon it as a principle in drama. 
In the light of this interpretation, we can not 
longer think of imitation as a servile, and more or 
less formal, copying of the thing seen. We are  
-P-A-G-E-225
  Drama 217 
now saying that in these activities of the children, 
when they are playing house, or playing hunter, 
or playing soldier, they are not copying some- 
thing they have seen or heard of ; they are keeping 
house, they are hunting, they are marching and 
fighting. Not even bodily activity is a more 
incessant and absolute aspect of play than this of 
make-believe. Imaginative children, and those 
that have some variety of experience, are rarely 
at leisure to appear in their own characters—so 
constant is the dramatic and imitative impulse in 
exercise. Indeed, two little girls I knew, after a 
forenoon of unceasing and strenuous impersona- 
tion of a repertoiré ranging from a door-mat and 
a cake of ice in the Delaware on through the ghost 
of the murdered Banquo, were finally obliged to 
sit down in utter weariness, when one of them 
suggested : “Now let’s play we’re just plain little 
girls.” In the same nursery of four children the 
child who returned to the room after any absence 
always cautiously inquired of each of the 
others, before taking up affairs: “What are you 
being now?” 
In certain hours of his study of literature and 
literary appreciation one is ready to believe that 
this impulse toward impersonation is the very 
fundamental fact in that appreciation. It is the 
door through which one enters into the situations
-P-A-G-E-226
  218 Literature in the Elementary School 
and feelings which make up the life represented 
_in the story, poem, or drama. This it is that gives 
that strange grip of reality to literature; it is 
this that turns the appreciation of literature into 
personal culture, so that in a very real sense one 
may substitute literature for experience. It is 
easy to utilize this passion very early, turning it in 
the direction of art. In the kindergarten they 
have long known how to adapt it in the play 
which they so wisely interchange and amalga- 
mate with their games; and the little pantomimes 
of “Bo-peep” and “Little Boy Blue,” of flocks 
of birds, of butterflies on the wing, and what not, 
are on the road to true dramatic art. But, alas! 
this is cut all too short in the school—the average 
school, where the scholars are converted immedi- 
ately into the veriest little pitchers—all ears; and, 
instead of being twenty selves in a day, they are 
denied the privilege of being even one whole one. 
This gift for impersonation should, like all their 
imaginative experiences, be conserved by exercise 
and guidance; otherwise it remains merely chaotic 
and accidental, and very soon the child himself is 
ashamed of it and regards its exercise as a “baby” 
performance to be left behind in the kindergarten. 
This exercise and guidance may be given by train- 
ing the children in little plays, which, to begin 
with, are not much more than pantomime, but
-P-A-G-E-227
Drama 219 
which add, as they go on, other elements of the 
real drama—an organized action and dialogue. 
Of course, there is the dramatic monologue— 
the recitation. But this does not meet the needs 
of the class. It is impossible that all the children 
should sympathetically impersonate the same 
character and realize the same experience. Neither 
does this sort of exercise—the recitation—give a 
chance for co-operation in the production of a bit 
of social art; it does not give them the discipline 
f apprehending and producing a large whole, and 
it tends to develop and foster an tinendurable kind 
and degree of egoism. 
Where are we to get these plays, since there 
are practically none of respectable literary quality 
ready to our hand? One must say “practically 
none,” because there are a few in print which can 
be used, chiefly dramatizations of folk- and fairy- 
tales. But, for the most part, and just as it should 
be, the teacher and the class will have to make 
their own plays, until in the eighth grade or there- 
abouts they are ready for some literary drama. 
As will be pointed out later, these co-operatively 
produced dramas constitute the best possible 
return which the children can make of their liter- 
ary training, and at the same time the best pos- 
sible means of securing their apprehension of the 
story they use; since in recasting a story as a play
-P-A-G-E-228
  
  
  220 Literature in the Elementary School 
they will come to know it as plot, as activity of 
persons, and as a structure made up of essential 
parts. 
Almost the first thing the child sees is the fact 
that there is something organic and necessary 
about these divisions and subdivisions. He sees 
them separate themselves out from the narrative 
as things in themselves, and then reunite to forma 
complete whole again. It matters not whether 
the story be one that he has been taught, a his- 
torical episode, or a story invented by himself, 
the emphasis upon structure, upon organization, 
which is one of the elements of drama, will be 
helpful, as a matter of literary training. 
As tothe dialogue—the actual literature of this 
communal drama—we must be most indulgent, 
and on the whole uncritical. A marked peculiar- 
ity of the dramatizations of the little people, as 
indeed of those of their elders, is that they for- 
get to be literature at all, so that what is not 
dumb-show must be set down as noise. It is a 
troublesome and delicate task for the teacher who 
is guiding them to manage to give the dialogue a 
tone better than mere commonplace and different 
from mere bombast. It is wisest, on the whole, 
to get them to choose stories and events that will 
sway their dialogue toward the bombastic and 
away from the commonplace; they will certainly
-P-A-G-E-229
  Drama 221 
be more spontaneous, and probably more artistic. 
And it is easy to set into every play some genuine 
gem of literature—a lyric to be sung, a little story 
to be told. It is desirable to introduce as much 
music as possible—really artistic little songs that 
fit into the atmosphere of the play and help to 
create it; it makes better “team-work.” A dance 
too, always provided it harmonizes with the tone 
and spirit of the play, helps the feeling of co- 
operative production. The children’s acting, in 
the sense of gesture and stage-business, is very 
likely to be stiff and artificial. Marches and 
dances that belong in the play make an imperative 
call for movement, and accustom them to action 
without self-consciousness and formality. 
The story, then, is generally given—it is some- 
thing the children have read, it is a historical 
event, though of course it may be furnished by 
some inventive member of the class, or evolved 
by them together. Whatever it is, it will in all 
probability not differ in any way from the story 
of any narrative. The plot will be the plot of the 
narrative story; it will be either an accident or a 
very noteworthy fact, if the material furnished 
displays a true dramatic plot. There will proba- 
bly be no true dramatic characterization. The 
teacher cannot aim at it, and must not expect it; 
though occasionally the born actor declares him- 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  
  222 Literature in the Elementary School 
self and presents us “a man in his humor” in 
true dramatic fashion. But, on the whole, we 
are contented if up to the time we are twelve or 
thirteen we move about the stage, as the per- 
sons move through the story, delivering ourselves 
of such dialogue as is needed to put the action 
forward—and nothing more. It goes without 
saying that place must be made for a large num- 
ber of “supis.” An army is a great device, for in 
the marching and manceuvering most of the class 
can manage to appear upon the stage first or 
last. Briar-Rose makes a great play for the 
third or fourth grade, for every man in the 
grade can appear as a thorn-bush in the hedge. 
There may easily be two different casts for every 
play. Occasionally there is the opportunity for 
the whole class to appear in character as audi- 
ence. 
It is almost impossible to say anything concern- 
ing the staging, the theatrical side, of these plays 
that will be helpful everywhere because the facili- 
ties vary so widely in different schools and differ- 
ent communities. In general, it is best to have 
what answers for a stage. There is some mystic 
influence in the raised platform, the curtain, the 
proscenium arch that cuts off this performance 
from the rest of the world and gives it at once 
the distinction of art. Every dramatic guide of  
-P-A-G-E-231
  Drama 223 
young people should help forward as much as 
possible the movement to free drama from the 
tyranny of the stage carpenter, the scene-painter, 
and the costumer. And with children as with the 
early folk-players it takes very little to create the 
illusion. A feather in his head makes the six- 
year-old ‘a noble red man without more ado. A 
sash over her shoulder converts a little maiden 
of the third grade into a haughty princess. But 
the feather and the sash are good pedagogy as# 
well as good art. An arm-chair makes a parlor; a 
half-dozen arm-loads of boughs makes a forest. 
I witnessed a stirring performance of Siegfried, 
the Child of the Forest, where the illusion of the 
deep-forest glades was created by three rubber 
plants, a potted palm, and a sword-fern in a 
jardiniére! A golden-haired Siegfried with an 
angora rug thrown over one shoulder, a black- 
ened Mimi with a mantle of burlap fastened about 
him with a trunk-strap—the whole atmosphero 
of art was there. 
As the children grow older, and alas! in most 
cases less imaginative, they will require more 
properties. If possible, they should work together 
to make the scenery and provide the properties, 
and should be prevailed upon to make their own 
costumes. The wise teacher will keep the costum-
-P-A-G-E-232
224 Literature in the Elementary School 
ing out of the hands of the “tender mamas” all he 
7 can; for in most cases the participation of the 
mothers in this side of the preparations, unless 
they are given specific directions and compelled to 
follow them, means the introduction of the fatal 
spirit of competitive finery. The children should 
be taught to see that the costuming is a part of 
the art, and that everybody’s costume must be 
brought “within the picture.” 
Now, up through the sixth or seventh grades 
(this will depend upon the average maturity of 
the children, upon the kind of culture in the 
homes from which they come, upon the character 
and knowledge of the teachers in the grades 
through which they have come) the plays that the 
children have should be of the kind we have been 
considering—epic material, mere direct story put 
together under the simplest of dramatic princi- 
ples—those of analysis into movements, of dia- 
logue and of action in its simpler forms. But in 
the eighth school year (merely to set a limit), and 
bridging the children over into their ninth 
or first year of high school, there may be a 
change. The child has gradually become con- 
scious of the complexity of life and human inter- 
ests; he begins to make his adolescent readjust- 
ment to the world, to realize in a conscious way 
its history and its institutions; his own studies 
   
-P-A-G-E-233
  Drama 225 
in history have become studies in the interweaving 
of complex factors; the great social institutions 
begin to press their claims and offer their attrac- 
tions; college looms ahead, conditioning all his 
undertakings; the church makes its appeal or 
asserts its rights; upon all too many children the 
institutions of business and industry make their 
call; in most children their own moral and reli- 
gious problems, and those of their mates, rise to 
consciousness. Epic directness and singleness 
now no longer seem an adequate picture of human 
affairs. It is now that the child has his first mo- 
ment of ripeness for the characteristic inner things 
of the literary drama: the clash and combination 
of institutions ; the revolt of the individual against 
the institution, with his final destruction or adjust- 
ment ; the plot which is an interweaving of ethical 
and complex social forces—the characters gener- 
ally intricate to begin with, and undergoing pro- 
found modification in the process of the action, 
different from the static epic characters he has 
known hitherto. In short, we may find that the 
eighth grade is ready for some specimens of that 
literary type which is the truest artistic presenta- 
tion of the social and moral complex, the literary 
drama. Luckily, there are grades and shades of 
complexity, and a wide range of choice as to the 
nature and difficulty of the problems involved. 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  226 Literature in the Elementary School 
One would scarcely encourage the eighth- or 
ninth-year school children to attack the intricate 
adjustment and interplay of Hamlet; he would 
not like them to follow the baffling complexities 
of social, personal, and economic considerations 
through The Pillars of Society. But The Mer- 
chant of Venice offers problems and situations 
which he can understand; in Julius Caesar and 
in Macbeth, in Wilhelm Tell, and in the Wallen- 
stein plays, noble and finished dramas as they are, 
» he encounters nothing that he cannot grasp. On 
the contrary, the ideas and the situations are such 
as he readily understands, and such as legitimately 
enlarge his horizon. The Shakespeare, at any 
rate, will probably be studied as poetry, and the 
children should be encouraged to act, in whole or 
in part, any play that they can study as literature. 
It may be that the facilities of the school will 
prohibit any attempt to stage one of these larger 
plays. In that event chosen bits may be given as 
dialogue or monologue fitted into a recital of the 
story, and a description of the situation. The 
teacher should always remember that the drama 
is oral literature, and the literature of it makes 
its legitimate appeal first to the ear. Children 
memorize so easily, that they will know the play 
by heart practically as soon as they have finished 
such a consideration of it as enables them to read
-P-A-G-E-235
  Drama 227 
it intelligently. If not, the striking and beauti- 
ful passages should be deliberately memorized. 
Should these dramatic performances be pro- 
duced before a public? Most certainly yes. Let 
it be however small a public—two neighboring 
grades, invited parents and friends; but let the 
study and effort bear its legitimate fruit in the 
public presentation. Only when we lead them to 
turn back what they have gained into a com- 
munity asset, have we done anything to train our 
children in social art. And this is so natural and 
easy in the case of an acted drama that it is a pity 
to miss the opportunity. Of course, they must 
love the thing they do. It must be made good 
enough to give, and be therefore offered. We 
shall gradually recover from the fright we have 
been in now for some time as to the children’s 
desire to “show off.” How can we be sure we 
should have had any art, if this motive had not 
mingled with the others in the production and 
publication of the art-product? Let us cease to 
give it an invidious name; instead of calling it 
the desire to “show off,” let us call it the artist’s 
passion—be he poet, painter, actor, what not—to 
communicate, to turn back into the common life 
this thing he has but drawn out of the common 
life to elaborate and beautify. 
The child and the theater makes a difficult
-P-A-G-E-236
228 Literature in the Elementary School 
problem. One need not say that a habitual 
theater-going child is a social, and most likely a 
moral, monster. But children should occasionally 
see a play with the pomp and circumstance of the 
stage. In the large cities it is not difficult to find 
a play or two each year that it is good for a child 
to see—something of Shakespeare, or some other 
heroic spectacle; some innocent programme of 
horse-play and frolic; some pretty pantomime, 
and occasionally a melodrama neither banal nor 
over-sentimental. If we but realized the theater 
as an educational and aesthetic force, we might 
secure many more such things by an intelligent 
appeal for them and an intelligent reception of 
them. 
After the children have had these few heroic 
plays we have discussd for the eighth or ninth 
grade, they mature so rapidly that their contact 
with the literary drama ceases to be a child’s 
problem at all; it passes into the field of second- 
ary training, where it must, as things now are in 
our schools, be approached from a somewhat 
different point of view.

  CHAPTER XIV 
THE PRESENTATION OF THE LITERATURE 
In this day of reaction, not to say revulsion, 
against “methods” in teaching, it is with much 
misgiving that one brings one’s self to speak of 
the practical details of teaching a subject, lest he 
be suspected of having a method or even a sys- 
tem, or lest those suggestions which he tries to 
give out as genetic and stimulating merely, be 
taken as a formalized plan. However, each body 
of material that has any degree of separateness 
has a handle by which it ought to be taken; dis- 
regarding the poor figure—paths by which one 
most easily comes to the center of it; certain 
points of view from which it looks most attractive 
and manageable. Some such handles, or paths, 
or points of view it will be the business of this 
chapter to indicate; and the suggestions to be 
offered are, it is to be hoped, so simple and so 
reasonable as to have occurred to many observing 
and growing teachers. 
The somewhat small body of literature to be 
used in the classes should practically throughout 
the elementary period be read to the children in 
class, not read by them. The relation of the litera- 
229
-P-A-G-E-238
    
230 Literature in the Elementary School 
ture to reading-lessons will be discussed elsewhere. 
It may well be that in the last years of the period 
many of the members of the class will have 
reached the stage of reading needful for the inter- 
pretative and apprehensive reading of literature; 
but the majority of the class will not. They will 
master the difficulties of mechanical reading; they 
may achieve the plane of intelligent reading. But 
here the large majority of them linger. Vast 
numbers of people never push on to the next plane 
—that of appreciative reading. And it is small 
wonder ; for the combination of mechanical, intel- 
lectual, and emotional processes that’ it involves 
constitutes it well-nigh the most difficult of 
achievements. Hosts of estimable and intelligent 
persons, respectable citizens, live out long years of 
greater or less usefulness, and never have a 
glimpse of this kind of reading. It is by no means 
true that even every good and useful citizen who 
teaches literature, can do this kind of reading; 
many times he cannot. But he can read better 
than the children. They, involved in the difficul- 
ties of their inexpert reading, cannot see the 
. woods for the trees; they are obliged to go so 
slowly, and to absorb so much energy in what one 
may call the manual work of reading, that they 
miss the essentially literary things—the move- 
ment, the picture, the music. 
   
-P-A-G-E-239
  Presentation of the Literature 231 
Of course, when we say “read,” we use the 
word in the broad sense of rendering the matter 
viva voce, whether it be actual reading from the 
text or reciting. While the person who is reading 
a story to children must be most concerned with 
spirit and meaning, he must not, if he suppose 
himself to be teaching literature, neglect the mat- 
ter of style. If the story is a translated one, he 
must make or choose some beautiful translation. 
Everything that he reads to them he must work 
over beforehand, so that he can give it with 
effective certainty. He more than defeats his 
purpose who transmits to his children no matter 
how good a story in slip-shod sentences, common- 
place phrasing, go-easy enunciation; or, worse 
than that, in the ostentatiously childlike language 
and manner that constitute official kinder- 
gartenese, or in the hilariously cheerful manner 
which marks traditional Sunday-schoolese; or, 
worst of all, in that tone of cheap irony that so 
many people see fit to adopt for all their com- 
munications with children. It is the tone of the 
average adult whenever he enters into conversa- 
tion with any acquaintance under twelve—an 
underbred or quite uncalled-for tone of badinage, 
of quizzing, of insincerity. It is an unpardonable 
misunderstanding of the dignity and seriousness 
of children to offer them babble when they ask
-P-A-G-E-240
  232 Literature in the Elementary School 
only simplicity, or to treat with flippancy what to 
them are the serious things of art. It should be 
quite possible to be serious without being solemn, 
and cheerful without being hilarious. This matter 
of a good style and form is so important that a 
teacher should achieve it at any cost of trouble 
and study. I like to use every opportunity to say 
that he should so thoroughly know his story or 
poem, be it the simplest old fairy-tale, or the 
veriest nursery-jingle, that he loves and respects 
it as art; and should so know and respect his 
audience and his purpose that a good and suitable 
literary form flows from him inevitably; or, if 
he is reading an actual text, that every sentence 
is both appreciative and interpretative. But, if 
he cannot achieve this, let him in the first instance 
write out a good form of his story, or find one 
and memorize it. There is no denying that in the 
hands of a cold and mechanical person this pro- 
duction will display some priggishness and false 
propriety. But the failure as literary training 
would be less disastrous in this case than if the 
same person gave a haphazard and commonplace 
impromptu version. 
There is such a thing as literary reading as 
distinguished from the reading of matter techni- 
cal in content and merely intellectual in appeal. 
Teachers, accustomed as they are to read for facts
-P-A-G-E-241
  Presentation of the Literature 233 
and intent upon the logical emphasis, are peculi- 
arly prone to read literature poorly—missing the 
music and the emotion, rendering it all in the hard 
intellectual manner that is acceptable only as the 
vehicle of the colorless matter of a technical 
treatise. There is also such a thing as the telling 
of a literary story, as distinguished from the tell- 
ing of any other story. A narrative of events in 
history, an account of some occurrence in nature 
or ordinary affairs, may be expected to proceed 
from point to point without arrangement or suc- 
cession other than the order of incidents as they 
occur. The interest is the interest of fact; the 
thread is that of cause and effect, or any other 
plain sequence. 
But in the literary story the incidents are sifted 
and arranged. Certain details are prophecies— 
foreshadowings of things to come; certain inci- 
dents are vital turning-points in the action; cer- 
tain phrases are the key and counter-sign of the 
whole story ; some paragraphs are plain narration; 
some are calm description; some are poetic inter- 
pretation ; some roar with action; some glow with 
emotion; some sparkle with fun; some lie in 
shadow, others stand forth in the brilliant light; 
there are movements in the story, marked by a 
change of scene, a change of situation, a pause 
in the action—parts which would be marked 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
    234 Literature in the Elementary School 
in the drama as scenes or acts; there is the 
gradual approach to the center, the pivotal 
occurrence, the readjustment of affairs to ordi- 
nary life. Ideally, all these things will be indi- 
cated in the presentation that an accomplished 
story-teller makes of a literary story. This 
seems to set the standard very high—too 
high for the discouraged attempt of the over- 
worked grade teacher. If so, she may reflect 
that it is triumphantly true that such is the affinity 
between the child and the story that he will get 
much delight and nourishment out of any telling 
of it. Who has not hesitated between a smile and 
a tear at the spectacle of a child or a class 
hanging enthralled and hungry upon a story ren- 
dered by a mother or a teacher whose every pro- 
nunciation was a jar, whose every cadence a dis- 
location, and whose every emphasis a misinterpre- 
tation? 
And remember, the art of story-telling is not 
the art of the theater, not the art of the actress, 
but the art of the mother, the nurse; the art of 
the “spinsters and the knitters in the sun;” the art 
of the wandering minstrel, of the journeyman 
tailor, of the exiled younger brother; art de- 
signed to reach, not an audience beyond the foot- 
lights, but one gathered on the sunny bench of 
the market-place, on the hearth-stone, under the  
-P-A-G-E-243
Presentation of the Literature 235 
nursery lamp, in the shady garden, and in their 
own teacher’s schoolroom. 
As a practical matter, the teacher, in pre- 
senting a story or a narrative poem, should take 
advantage of the natural pauses, the end of one 
incident or movement and the beginning of the 
next, in dividing his material for the actual 
lessons, so that in a long story or in a drama, 
the end of the lesson coincides with the close 
of a series of incidents or the close of one of 
the larger movements. Nothing spoils a bit of 
literature more effectually than taking it in acci- 
dental or fragmentary bits. At any cost of time 
and pains, let there be a sense of completeness 
in each lesson, a feeling of repose, if only tem- 
porary, at the end of each instalment. And 
whether he closes his lesson or not, the teacher 
should at the close of every such movement in a 
class of older children pause to discuss, to review, 
or to summarize. When he makes this recog- 
nition of the close of a series of incidents, or of a 
movement, he accomplishes two things: he secures 
a certain amount of completeness, and he helps 
on in the children the desirable sense of organiza- 
tion, of composition, in their story or play. 
The nature of the bit of literature chosen must 
guide the teacher in his first presentation of it. 
When it is a thing in which the movement is 
   
-P-A-G-E-244
    236 Literature in the Elementary School 
rapid, or the interest in the action or the plot 
intense, it will doubtless be best to go rapidly 
through the whole, not pausing for any details. 
Then go over it slowly again, pausing for appre- 
ciation and comment. It seems well to repeat 
here that if the story is long and the plot involves 
any intensity of suspense, it may be well to let the 
children know the issue early in the story; the 
wisdom of this step will depend largely upon the - 
average nerves of the class. There may well be 
several readings of a thing worth reading once. 
Every teacher knows how well content the 
younger children, especially, are to go over a 
thing many times. The interest of the class of 
older children may be kept up through the many 
readings of a story or poem, by shifting each 
time the ground of comment or discussion, open- 
ing up a new question or revealing a new point 
of interest at each reading. In other pieces, the 
slower moving stories and lyrics, the children are 
willing to linger over the details at the first 
reading. 
It is all but impossible to indicate what such 
details are, or what we mean by lingering over 
them. I have pointed out in some detail, in the 
chapter on poetry, the kind of thing that one 
would linger over for comment and question. 
If it is a new, rare, or especially picturesque
-P-A-G-E-245
  Presentation of the Literature 237 
word, we may ask questions and receive com- 
ments, or according to, the situation, give quick 
and direct information about it: “The golden 
orange glows;” “He strung the bow deftly,” 
“The butter-cup catches the sun in its chalice.” 
These three words call for attention for different 
reasons, in addition to the fact that any or all of 
them might be new and unknown words to the 
class. In the case of a figure or image we would 
pause and discuss the various terms and details of 
it, until most members of the class have at least 
intellectually apprehended it. Such a complex 
little figure and image as “footsteps of the fall- 
ing drops down the ladder of the leaves” calls for 
leisurely appreciation and assimilation. A 
peculiar musical onomatopoeic line will interest 
them; “Burly dozing bumble-bee,” is such a line. 
They will be delighted to discover why this 
peculiar assemblage of sounds was chosen in con- 
nection with this insect. “The long day wanes, 
the slow moon climbs,” indicating and imitating 
by its slow movement and long vowels the pas- 
sage of the lingering hours, is an effect they 
should be led to realize. We should pause to 
point out, or to inquire into, the implications 
of some pregnant or pivotal sentence, such 
as: “Now, Cinderella’s godmother was fay;” 
or, “Cyclops, you asked my noble name, and I
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 Literature in the Elementary School 
will tell it: My name is Noman.” The bit 
selected for detailed study may be larger, amount- 
ing to a complete incident—for example, Nausicaa 
with her maids washing her beautiful clothes by 
the river ; some scene or incident full of character 
and symbolical meaning, as the scene with the hen 
and the cat in The Ugly Duckling; some ethical 
or moral question that calls for judgment, such 
as Robin Hood’s treatment of the unjust abbot, or 
Portia’s decision as to Shylock’s bond. 
These examples, chosen at random, are in- 
tended simply to suggest the kind of thing to be 
stopped over. It would be a grave mistake to 
pause over every such detail, or to try to make 
sure that the children apprehend even intellect- 
ually every item as it appears. Leave many of 
them for subsequent readings; let many of them 
lie permanently, depending rather on the effects 
of the general tone and spirit of the production 
for your results. One of the first lessons to learn 
about the teaching of literature is that it will not 
do to teach the whole art on the basis of one 
specimen—that it will not do to teach in any case 
all that one could. One must rather try to teach 
the characteristic, the inevitable lesson—the lesson 
demanded by the genius of his piece. Let the

talk” and lecture. Keep the literature as near

Presentation of the Literature 239 
play as possible—the play that cultivates and dis- 
ciplines through the avenues of refined pleasure. 
It will often be necessary for the teacher to 
shorten and otherwise edit the thing he chooses. 
There will come from time to time dull passages, 
descriptive passages, passages whose  subject- 
matter is too mature, or in some other way unde- 
sirable for his class. He will often be able to 
economize effort and to secure a better unity of 
impression, by omitting what is mere enrichment 
of the picture or reinforcement of the teaching; 
such incidents may be removed without altering 
the meaning or the movement. The teacher must 
be experienced enough to recognize such unneces- 
sary or superfluous incidents; otherwise he only 
mutilates his story in condensing it. 
When the children have advanced to some pro- 
ficiency in reading, they will, of course, begin to 
read some of their own literature, reading aloud 
in the class and often having the text before them 
as the teacher reads. All the children that can 
read at all should, as a rule, have a printed copy 
of anything they are asked to memorize; and as 
a matter of social duty, the teacher of literature, 
or the teacher in the literature class, will from 
time to time have a careful exercise in reading 
for the younger readers; while he will have much 
reading aloud from the older grades; remember- 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
    240 Literature in the Elementary School 
ing that the inevitable obverse of receiving litera- 
ture through the ear is the rendering it with the 
voice. But, on the whole, they will fare best if 
up to and probably through the sixth grade they 
receive what is distinctively literature through the 
ear. And even after that they should often 
hear their material rendered by a good reader in 
class, even though they may be required to read 
the same material over beforehand, or subsequent 
to the class reading. 
Every teacher should have in reserve a store of 
stories and poems, and beautiful passages from 
great masterpieces which he produces from time 
to time as a surprise to his class. This is many a 
time the most effective lesson possible—adding to 
the children’s pleasure the delight of surprise, 
creating in them the impression of the inexhaust- 
ible supply of beautiful things, and testifying to 
their teacher’s own joy in the things he wants 
them to love. 
Other minor and practical matters, more 
closely connected with the return from the chil- 
dren than the presentation to them, will be dis- 
cussed in the next chapter. 
Finally, the whole matter is conditioned and 
colored by the fact that in any case the literature 
is transmitted to the children through the person- 
ality of the teacher. This is partially true of all
-P-A-G-E-249
  Presentation of the Literature 241 
a child’s subjects and his whole experience in 
school; but the fact that literature is so inwoven 
with feeling, and so bound up with matters of per- 
sonal taste, that it concerns itself so much with 
matters of ethics and conduct, makes it peculiarly 
liable to take on color, to narrow or to widen 
with the personality of him who chooses and ren- 
ders it. A teacher must accept this fact, and 
profit by the obvious warnings that arise out of 
it; but better than that, build his work upon the 
many beneficent aspects of the fact. The teacher 
before his class is the sacred bard at the feast; 
he is an exhaustless spring of joy, a tireless play- 
fellow, a preacher who never proses, a school- 
master who never scolds.
-P-A-G-E-250
  CHAPTER XV 
THE RETURN FROM THE CHILDREN 
The discussion must naturally limit itself 
largely to the immediate return that we may ask 
of the children from their lessons in literature; 
since it is not possible to do more than hint at 
their ultimate effects. It is, of course, a matter of 
pedagogical morality to ask from them some 
immediate and practical return, or some actual 
literary contributions to the lessons. There are 
certain modifications of the modern doctrine that 
every stimulation of the mind or the emotions 
should eventuate in activity—modifications that 
apply to all the fine arts. The aesthetic experi- 
ence is a complete experience in itself; the 
apprehension, the enjoyment, and the final appre- 
ciation which one passes through in his contact 
with a beautiful piece of art—a picture, a 
symphony, an ode—constitute a complete psychic 
experience; they eventuate in a better taste, a 
higher ideal, the record of a pure and noble joy. 
They do not demand further activity. We need 
not feel, therefore, that it is a matter of necessity 
to ask that in every case the class make some 
tangible response to every literary impression. 
242 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
  Return from the Children 243 
But the teacher of literature must feel that 
he shares with all their other teachers the re- 
sponsibility and the duty of making social beings 
of the children, of equipping them with the means 
of expression and communication, so that they 
may turn back into the sum-total a product in 
exchange for the material they draw out. He 
must, therefore, associate with the lessons a 
legitimate amount of exercise for his class in 
imparting what they have learned and in creating 
literary products for themselves. 
The first and simplest return we ask is the oral 
comment, the immediate discussion that accom- 
panies the presentation of the work. When a 
story has been read, there should always be op- 
portunity for question and comment. This the 
teacher must guide and restrain. Of course, he 
should be hospitable to suggestions and contri- 
butioxs, patient, and generous to questions. But 
he must be cautious never to let the talk even on 
the part of the smallest children remain mere 
prattle, or degenerate into an aimless scamper 
around the paddock; he will see that there is a 
point or a line to cling to, and he will manage 
that this shall be done. Every teacher knows 
lhow one petty or commonplace child, one would- 
be wit or skeptic, can drag the discussion into the 
dust and keep it there, unless he is promptly and
-P-A-G-E-252
  244 Literature in the Elementary School 
perhaps vigorously suppressed. Of course, in 
these discussions there is very small opportunity 
for training the voice and criticizing the language. 
Let there be, if possible, a free flow of comment 
and contribution, uninterrupted by any corrections 
except those of the most egregious errors. The 
teacher who guides it should study his questions, 
and even with the little ones should bring into the 
light of discussion the vital and salient things, 
and by means of a question from time to time, 
keep the conference away from triviality and 
gossip. He will begin to train his children from 
the beginning to make legitimate inductions from 
their material, and will require them to give 
reasons based upon the actual story or poem. He 
will be able to lead them to find the precise point 
of departure in the story for the introduction of 
their personal experience or their new incident, 
and he will help them in every case to make clear 
the application of their own material to the dis- 
cussion. 
It is in this spontaneous and free, but guided, 
conference that the children get most good out 
of the literature lessons. Of course, as they grow 
older the discussion of persons and their conduct, 
and the ethical and social bearing of events and 
opinions, may be broadened and deepened. As 
they grow older, too, more correctness and style
-P-A-G-E-253
  Return from the Children 245 
and fulness may be demanded in their impromptu 
contributions to the discussion. A child may, 
without suspecting it, and consequently without 
self-consciousness, acquire some considerable 
skill in extemporaneous speaking and some genu- 
ine intellectual ease in conversation from these 
class discussions. 
Another natural return to be asked from the 
children is the repetition of the story, in whole or 
in part, by members of the class in their own 
words; though of course, after many hearings of 
it well told the children will have incorporated 
into their own vocabulary the most useful and 
characteristic words. This exercise should never 
be allowed to pass into a careless and slipshod 
performance; the children should be alive and 
responding alertly to the call made upon them. 
Their grammar, their sentences, their emphases 
and intonations may appropriately be corrected 
more vigorously in this exercise than in the spon- 
taneous discussion. 
The best literary effect is not secured by having 
the story retold immediately after the children 
have heard it, nor by having them understand 
beforehand that it is to be retold as a formal exer- 
cise. It may be brought out of them on some later 
loccasion so as to give it the air of an independent 
contribution to the pleasure of the class. Nothing
-P-A-G-E-254
246 Literature in te Elementary School 
is more deadly to silaseconlel of a story than 
the certainty on the part of the children that they 
are going to be called upon to retell it. This 
should never become a habitual exercise. It helps 
in a literary as well as a social way to divide the 
story in the retelling among the children ac- 
cording to movements, or even according to inci- 
dents, since this calls attention to its parts and 
organization. | 
We may reasonably expect all the poems 
taught as literature to be memorized, since it does 
not take many repetitions of a poem to fix it ina 
child’s memory. The vocal production of this 
poem gives the best opportunity for cultivating 
the child in voice, in enunciation and pronuncia- 
tion. The teacher should not, of course, seem 
querulous and exacting in small matters, and it 
is better to leave a few careless spots in any one 
poem than to spoil the children’s pleasure in it by 
too close criticism; but he can do much to help 
all the children toward a distinguished manner 
of expression. These memorized poems, like 
the stories they learn, should not be regarded 
as formal exercises to be recited once and be done 
with. They should be called for from time to 
time as contributions to the pleasure of the whole 
class. Time is profitably given now and then toa 
story or verse tournament, a sang-fest, when the 
|
-P-A-G-E-255
  Return from the Children 247 
whole store of things acquired is brought out 
and enjoyed. In the two older classes each child 
may be required to choose, prepare, and present 
to the class a bit of literature. The choice and 
preparation must be done in consultation with 
the teacher; the presentation to the class regarded 
as a contribution to their artistic experience and 
accepted without criticism. 
Paraphrasing is a process of doubtful value. 
It is never possible to express the precise mean- 
ing or mood in other words, and in the case of 
verse it serves to destroy the sense of inviolability 
of form that one would desire to develop and 
deepen. The direction, “State the same thought 
in other words,” should never be given. To one 
delicately alive to the value of words and the 
shades of thought, it is a mere contradiction in 
terms. The same may be said of the practice of 
getting the children to substitute synonyms; in 
iterature, especially in poetry, there can be no 
rue synonyms, and no precisely synonymous ex- 
ressions. 
Many pleasant experiments are to be made in 
onnecting some of the handwork of the young- 
st children with their literature. The attempt 
o realize some of their images in actual stuff 
mstitutes an artistic experiment that has its 
iterary reverberations, and helps to deepen. the

association, Let them make a cloak for Little 
Red Riding-Hood, a fairies’ coach of a nut shell, 
a boat, a tent—or whatever little object or 
property is imbedded in the story. Out of 
practically every story, and out of many of 
the poems, they get an inspiration for a picture 
or a bit of modeling. Such associations with 
literature are legitimate and natural. This appears 
very clear when we reflect that we are hoping to 
cultivate the taste and imagination of the chil- 
dren, and to teach them to love human life, with 
all that this implies, as well as to drill them in 
language, grammar, and writing. 
It seems necessary to handle aspects of the 
problem of language and writing in connection 
with literature in several different places, as we 
come upon the topic from different points of view. 
As has been said before, it is the duty of the 
teacher of literature, and of the lessons in litera- 
ture, to help along the work in the language arts. 
It is even fair to assume that the children will 
take more interest in their composition lessons, 
and will get more profit out of them, when they 
are attached to something they have done in liter-| 
ature; but this is because they get out of litera- 
ture more impulse toward creation, and mor 
inspiration toward a beautiful and striking man 
ner of expression. But composition is not merel     
    
                 
   
-P-A-G-E-257
Return from the Children 249 
a medium of creative expression; it is a means of 
plain communication, and should be developed 
in both directions and from both sources. This 
means that the children should write in con- 
nection with all their subjects, so that they do 
not, on the one hand, associate “English” and 
writing with literature only, and do not, on the 
other hand, run the risk of forming no style but 
a literary style. 
It is certainly true that we disquiet ourselves 
and persecute the children unnecessarily concern- 
ing the whole matter of writing during the ele- 
mentary period. The children scarcely acquire 
the process of writing as a manual thing in the 
first four years. During the next four by good 
luck and much toil, most of them manage to 
reduce it to the stage of a tool. Their conscious- 
ness of the process added to their consciousness of 
their spelling and grammar, leaves them little 
freedom in using the written composition as an 
avenue of spontaneous expression. Add to this 
the fact that a large part of this period—the 
period of ten to fourteen—is the beginning of the 
great reticence. They are not telling what they 
know or feel; they have narrowed their vocabu- 
lary down to the absolutely necessary terms; 
they have seen through every device by which the 
teacher seeks to get them to express themselves. 
  eee
-P-A-G-E-258
  250 Literature in the Elementary School 
Their written compositions will be, therefore, 
dogged exercises, and should be connected, as 
far as possible, with colorless information sub- 
jects. There are exceptional children and excep- 
tional classes, indeed, to whom these generaliza- 
tions do not apply. We have all heard of classes 
in distant elementary schools which “loved” to 
write. 
But there will of necessity be a certain amount 
of composition that will fall in with the work in 
literature, and will constitute one of the logical 
returns we ask of the children. This the teacher 
would like to have as spontaneous and as literary 
as possible. In general, we should like it to be crea- | 
tive, and not critical or reproductive. We would 
encourage them to devise new adventures of 
Odysseus, or of Robin Hood, to give an experi- 
ence of their own organized into a genuine story, 
an interpretation and effective description of some 
incident or event that has interested them or been 
invented by them. It is necessary, if you expect 
to get anything literary or creative out of them, 
to help to put them in the creative and literary 
mood. Talk over with them the thing they mean 
to do; see that they have the vocabulary they will 
obviously need; enlarge their range of compari- 
son and allusion by discussion ; lead them to divide 
their material into suitable parts with some 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  Return from the Children 251 
acceptable sequence ; enrich their topics by kindred 
material; guide them into the observation and 
interpretation of material in the imaginative and 
literary way. 
Some aspects of this process are illustrated in 
the following experience: A teacher had been 
reading Howard Pyle’s Robin Hood, with occa- 
sionally one of the original ballads interspersed 
(but not the traditional “Robin Hood and the 
| Potter”), for three months; the children had 
also memorized during the same time three short 
lyrics; and in every lesson there had been dis- 
cussions ; the time had come when they must make 
something. They decided to follow the plan of 
their book and tell how Robin Hood added a new 
member to his band. These children were making 
pottery by way of handwork, and had lately had 
an interesting visit to see a potter working with 
his wheel. So the suggestion naturally made by 
some member of the class, that the new member 
of Robin Hood’s band be a potter, was received 
with instant favor. The teacher read them “Peter 
Bell,” and their hero promptly became a peddler- 
potter—the very same, suggested an agile child, 
whom Tom, the Piper’s son, found beating his 
ass, and upon whom he played the merry trick. 
By this time the class could be restrained no 
longer. They climbed over one another’s shoul- 
ee
-P-A-G-E-260
  252 Literature in the Elementary School 
ders, literally and figuratively, with eager sug- 
gestions and copious details. After discussing the 
plan long enough to suggest an organization of 
the material into three natural parts, the children 
were set to work. The orderly and patient chil- 
dren produced satisfactory stories, abundant in 
material and beautiful in detail. All the others 
produced stories which, however disorderly and 
careless, were breathless with feeling and over- 
flowing with stuff. Some of them adopted Tom, 
the Piper’s son, as the new member of the band, 
not being able*to forgive the potter for beating 
the ass ; some adopted them both; others, only the 
Potter, duly lessoned and converted; all provided 
for the donkey. When they were aroused and 
provided, there was a spontaneous outflow of 
what was in every case, allowing for the varying 
temperaments and acquirements of the children, a 
really literary production. 
As long as the children are seriously hampered 
with the mechanics of writing, they should be 
allowed to dictate their work, when any practical 
plan can be devised for this. When the class is 
not too large, they should be taught to make a 
co-operative product, the teacher taking down 
what they agree upon, revising it to suit them. 
In the case of the older children these spontaneous 
and “literary” productions should not be too  
-P-A-G-E-261
  Return from the Children 253 
minutely criticized, and the revising and rewriting 
of them should not become a matter of drudgery. 
They should have other and more colorless writ- 
ten work upon which they may be drilled, lest 
the drill should kill their creative impulse or spoil 
their pleasure in the created product. Their more 
important productions may be filed and given 
back to them six months later for their own cor- 
rection. This critical review of their own work 
is generally an occasion of much pride, and the 
acquisition of some wholesome self-knowledge. 
It is possible that this attempt to distinguish 
literary writing from other composition may con- 
vey the impression that literature and literary pro- 
duction are set off, quite apart from life, and the 
children’s other experiences and interests. This 
would be a misfortune. Whenever any aspect 
of their lives, their work, or their play appeals to 
their emotions and their imaginations, when they 
are provided with a large vocabulary and have 
opened for them avenues of comparison, they will 
turn back a literary product. But it is seldom 
desirable to create this atmosphere in connection 
with their other studies, and the literary style 
and method is not a desirable one for all subjects. 
For the sake of the practice in writing and 
composing, and for the sake of acquiring ease in 
telling in writing what they know or desire to
-P-A-G-E-262
    
254 Literature in the Elementary School 
communicate, the children may write something 
every day. But not oftener than once in six 
weeks can we build up in a class the atmosphere, 
furnish the material, and bring up the enthusiasm 
for the production of something worth while in a 
literary way—story, essay, play, or poem. 
To set the elementary child, or even the high- 
school scholar, tasks of investigating in litera- 
ture, as if he were a little college student is a 
serious mistake; or to set for him themes which 
call for such opinions and judgments as could 
be safely given only by a mature person. For 
instance, to ask the eighth grade in the aver- 
age school to write a character-sketch of Shylock 
is to make a bid for insincerity and unfounded 
judgment. But satisfactory results may be ob- 
tained by giving the children a simple syllabus of 
questions and suggestions, indicating quite suit- 
able problems for them to work at in their out-of- 
school reading; this little syllabus is then made 
the basis of class discussion, and parts of it 
finally, of written work. It requires some skill 
to make such a syllabus, since it must not be 
made up of leading questions nor of tediously 
detailed suggestions, neither must it attempt to 
exhaust the material; but must be calculated to 
stimulate the children to observe and to think, 
and must be designed to guide them into those
-P-A-G-E-263
  Return from the Children 255 
aspects of the story, play or poem that they may 
suitably and profitably consider. Such a guide 
should be placed in the hands of young students 
including secondary children, whenever they are 
studying a mature and complex masterpiece. 
The dramatization and acting of any bit of 
literature that yields to this process is in many 
ways the most satisfactory return we can ask. In 
a previous chapter much has been said about the 
various dramatic settings and accompaniments of 
literature. From the treatment of rhymes and 
jingles as suggestions for games and plays, on 
through the genuine dramatization of a story, to 
the presentation of The Merchant of Venice or 
some other developed literary drama, the teacher 
should forward as much as possible this mode of 
calling out the children. They must, of course, 
be guided by the teacher in the choice of a story 
for dramatization, seeking one that has clearly 
marked movements, some distinct events, a pretty 
well-rounded plot, occasion for dialogue, and 
other dramatic possibilities. The class may early 
be guided to the division of the story into its 
natural acts and scenes, which implies the omis- 
sion of superfluous incidents and details. The 
difficulty comes in the supplying of the actual 
dialogue. The resourceful teacher will secure 
this dialogue by various means; for some of the
-P-A-G-E-264
  256 Literature in the Elementary School 
scenes it will flow off without effort from the 
class in lesson assembled, one child suggesting a 
remark, another the reply, these being recorded 
and criticized by the class. For certain other 
scenes the dialogue may be prepared by groups 
of two or more children working apart from the 
class. For certain crucial and lofty scenes the 
teacher should make the “book.” The whole 
must be submitted for discussion in the class, and 
may in the end call for considerable revision from 
the teacher; for the younger children cannot be 
expected to know and to meet the demands of 
dramatic dialogue—it must not only be speech, 
and fairly good as conversation, but it must for- 
ward the play with every sentence. Of course, 
this revision must never be so sweeping as radi- 
cally to remake the play, or even to alter the 
essential character that the children have given it, 
no matter how crude it may seem to the teacher 
and to other mature persons who hear it. Let it 
stand as a bit of child-art, just as we rejoice to let 
crude productions stand as folk-art. 
Of course, when the older children present a 
literary play or any part of it, they must mem- 
orize and give it conscientiously as it is written. 
Indeed, the rendering with understanding and 
appreciation, of whatever they have learned of 
good and beautiful literature is, after all, the
-P-A-G-E-265
  Return from the Children 257 
most satisfactory and natural return. If even in 
high school we asked this of the children, instead 
of those themes of crude or stale literary criticism 
which we all too often get, great would be the 
gain in freshness, in sincerity, in appreciation, 
and in ultimate taste. 
If we accustom the children to it from the 
beginning, and never intimate to them that it is 
difficult, it is about as easy to get verse out of 
them as prose. This is particularly true if the 
exercise is a social or co-operative one, in which 
the whole class unites to produce the ballad or the 
song. What the single child could not accom- 
plish, the group does with perfect ease. And 
when the poem is done, nobody can tell who sug- 
gested this rhyme, this word, this whole line; but 
the whole is a product of which each child is 
proud, though he alone could never have com- 
passed it. The communal story, ballad, song, or 
play is a unique and interesting performance, and 
any teacher who has ever assisted in making it 
feels sure that he has seen far into the social 
possibilities of art and the philosophy of litera- 
ture. Every teacher must devise his own plan of 
getting this co-operative, communal, social bit of 
literature made, but every teacher of literature 
should try it. 
All this, of course, has to do with the immedi-
-P-A-G-E-266
  258 Literature in the Elementary School 
ate practical return from the studies in literature. 
Concerning the ultimate, distant return we can- 
not speak in terms of teaching and learning. Art 
is long; like the human child, being destined to a 
long and vicissitudinous life, it had a long child- 
hood; and this is true of its growth in each indi- 
vidual as of its growth in the race. So far as 
regards many of the most desired results of litera- 
ture, we can but sow the seed, and wait years for 
the bloom—a lifetime, maybe, for the fruit. But 
though we may not reach a hand through all the 
years to grasp the far-off interest of our toil, we 
have every reason to believe that the harvest will 
be fair.

CHAPTER XVI 
THE CORRELATIONS OF LITERATURE 
The term “correlation” is not to be used in 
this chapter in the specialized and technical sense 
that it has taken on in pedagogical discussion. It 
will be used, with apologies, to designate all con- 
nections of literature with any other subject or 
discipline in the elementary curriculum. 
No one interested in education can have failed 
to notice the fact that the doctrines of concentra- 
tion, correlation, condensation, by whatever name 
called or under whatever aspect approached, have 
undergone many modifications and shifts of em- 
phasis. Like every other educational doctrine that 
has much of the truth in it, it was welcomed in the 
early days of its promulgation as the final solu- 
tion, and seemed for a time to sweep out of exist- 
ence, or into its own radius, every other theory or 
practice. 
One is obliged to wonder if educational people 
are peculiarly liable to be caught by a formula 
or an’apparently axiomatic statement, build every- 
thing upon it, and silence every question by a 
reverential appeal to it. Such seemed to be the 
attitude toward the doctrine of correlation when 
259
-P-A-G-E-268
  260 Literature in the Elementary School 
it first sifted down from the savants to the actual 
teachers in the actual schools; and many and 
monumental were the follies committed in the 
name of this pedagogical religion. Modified 
and adapted under actual practical conditions, 
and criticized by the present generation of edu- 
cational philosophers, it has come down to 
the school of today—that is to say, the school 
that is sensitive enough and free enough to 
respond quickly to new thinking—as, on the 
one hand, a protest against isolation and abstrac- 
tion, and on the other hand, an appeal for 
such a conservation of the unity and naturalness 
of the child’s consciousness as is consistent with 
the natural and legitimate use of material. In 
its present form the doctrine no longer justifies 
the violent wresting of subjects and topics from 
their natural settings, to be fitted together in some 
merely logical and theoretical system of instruc- 
tion. 
In the days of determined and thoroughgoing 
correlation no department of discipline suffered 
more than the arts; and none of the other arts 
suffered as did literature. This is not difficult 
to account for. Music and painting are quite 
professedly and obviously unconcerned with sub- 
ject-matter—are, as a rule, entirely empty of 
definite intellectual content. But literature has
-P-A-G-E-269
  Correlations of Literature 261 
ideas, it embodies concrete images, mentions 
specific objects, reflects experience, and some- 
times even uses actual persons and _ historical 
| events; above all, it employs the same medium 
of expression as the other subjects. All these 
matters made literature the peculiar prey of the 
ardent correlationists; to each or any, perhaps 
to all, of these phenomena in literature they could 
attach bodies of teaching in technical subjects, 
and systems of discipline in formal training. 
The case was equally bad when literature was 
constituted the center of the scheme, and when it 
was attached to a scheme having some other 
center—geography, for example, or history. For 
in the first case it was altogether likely that some 
detail or aspect of the piece of literature, merely 
subsidiary in the literature, would be selected for 
emphasis and elevated into the correlating detail ; 
the background or setting would be taken out for 
study and elaboration, crowding the action, the 
human and really literary elements, out of sight. 
As, for example—and it is an authentic example 
of a scheme of correlation—the first-grade chil- 
dren are given as the center of their work The 
Old Woman Who Found the Sixpence; from this 
story we take out the dog, which we study as the 
type of digitigrade carnivora. Or—again an au- 
thentic example—having read to the first grade

  262 Literature in the Elementary School 
The Musicians of Bremen, as one of them hap- 
pens to be a donkey, we seize the opportunity to 
teach in detail and over several weeks of time, the 
physical peculiarities of the donkey and his kins- 
man the horse, among many exercises drawing 
out of the children some speculation or informa- 
tion as to how much water or hay the horse con- 
sumes; to which hook we attach instruction as to 
weights and measures; and so on into the remote | 
fringes of information about objects and persons 
used in the story only in the literary way. 
In the second case, that in which literature is 
attached to some other center, in feeling about 
for some bit of literature to fit into a geographi- 
cal fact, a meteorological condition, or a histori- 
cal event, the teacher was quite likely to hit 
upon a third- or fourth-rate specimen, unsuitable 
for his children in other respects, and in teaching 
it he was likely to force from it a meaning and 
an emphasis that as literature it would not bear; 
as, when the children were studying the migration 
of birds, he taught them Bryant’s “To a Water- 
fowl,” emphasizing the migration and ignoring 
the true emphasis of the poem—the lesson of a 
guiding providence; or as, apropos of December 
weather, he set the fifth grade to reading Whit- 
tier’s slow-moving, meditative, and much too 
mature “Snow-Bound.”
-P-A-G-E-271
Correlations of Literature 263 
As a matter of fact, no art yields kindly to any 
method of adjustment to other subjects that em- 
phasizes the subject-matter or information 
material that may perchance be involved in the 
art. Information-giving is not the method nor 
the mission of art; the four, or five arts if we in- 
clude acting, with which we may have to do in ele- 
mentary discipline combine and play into one 
another without difficulty. It is not necessary to 
speak again of the close and easy association of 
literature with all the forms of acting that the 
children have, from marching, dancing, and sim- 
ple gesture, on to the acting required in an organ- 
ized drama. On the musical side, particularly the 
verse-form of literature, it combines most accept- 
ably with music. A great many of the lyrics 
that are simple enough for the children to learn, 
and many of the verses that they write, are also 
adaptable as songs to be sung. And even when 
they cannot be set to melodies they share, in 
their spoken form, with the actual musical notes, 
in the training of the ear. The exercises in draw- 
ing, painting, and modeling co-operate to fine 
advantage for the objectifying of the visual 
images, of which the children get so large a store 
from literature. As a matter of fact, when the 
children are set the task of objectifying an inner 
image, it is most likely to be some figure or scene  
-P-A-G-E-272
    264 Literature in the Elementary Schoot 
from literature that comes up for expression— 
Nausicaa throwing the ball, Robin Hood string- 
ing his bow, Siegfried tempering his sword, Paul 
Revere mounting his horse, the lodge of old 
Nokomis. This is because the images and pic- 
tures they find in literature retain in the minds 
of the children the glow of imagination, the 
warmth of emotion, the vitality of a remembered 
joy. And it is true, as every teacher knows who 
has taught it aright, that a bit of literature arouses 
in the children a mood of imaginative creation 
such as no other subject ever can awaken. This 
mood of imaginative creation instinctively ex- 
presses itself in literary composition, in drawing, 
painting, designing, modeling, acting, or music. 
On the very surface of the problem of the 
correlations of literature lies the somewhat diffi- 
cult question of the relation of the children’s liter- 
ature to their lessons in reading—as regards both 
their beginning to read and their later practice in 
reading. It remains true that with all our experi- 
menting and in spite of all the enthusiasm we can 
muster, to the majority of children and in the 
hands of most teachers the mechanics of learning 
to read is drudgery. This drudgery literature 
should share with the other subjects in its due 
proportion. One would not ignore the fact that 
this “due proportion” may be very large—larger
-P-A-G-E-273
  Correlations of Literature 265 
than that of any other subject. It is quite legiti- 
mate to employ the charm and interest of litera- 
ture in the service of reading; and it would be a 
serious misfortune for the children to learn their 
reading entirely through the medium of color- 
less fact. We have agreed that there is such 
a thing as literary reading, different in many 
ways from the reading of history or science. 
Even the younger children can feel this, and can 
produce it if correctly guided. But they should 
not always be doing literary reading; they 
should acquire the colorless but good style of 
merely intellectual reading. This they will not 
do if in their early reading exercises they are 
given more than their due proportion of literature. 
It is undoubtedly wise to make upon the 
teacher and the children the impression that read- 
ing is a tool, a key—perhaps we would better call 
it a gate through which one gets at many 
things—the joys and rewards of literature, to be 
sure, but also the images of history, the facts of 
nature, the details of handicraft. A reading- 
book, or any system of reading-lessons that con- 
tains nothing but literature is therefore a 
mistake. 
From another point of view it is a misfortune 
to identify the reading-lessons with literature. As 
has been said more than once in these chapters,
-P-A-G-E-274
  266 Literature in the Elementary School 
the alert teacher of our day is eager to emanci- 
pate literature again from its bondage to the 
printed page, and to set free once more its func- 
tion as a truly social art ; making it also once more 
a matter of the listening ear and the living voice. 
To identify the reading-lessons of the younger 
children with their literature lessons is to keep 
them at things much too immature, and to retard 
their mental and artistic growth. They can appre- 
hend and appreciate many things that they can- 
not read. It is a commonplace that a child’s 
listening vocabulary is far in advance of his read- 
ing vocabulary, no matter how or how early he 
learns to read. Of course, this is the secret of the 
revolt against book-reading of the children who 
learn to read late—the simplicity of the thought 
and expression in the matter they are mechan- 
ically able to read, makes it unacceptable to them 
intellectually. It is in the literature received by 
his ear that a child grows and exercises his 
maturer powers. The older children should be 
taught and exercised in literary reading, the 
simple interpretative reading of their literature. 
The best results in this most profitable aspect of 
the teaching of literature can be obtained in the 
secondary period, when the children are expert 
enough as readers to think while they read, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  
Correlations of Literature 267 
when their voices are, as mere mechanical organs, 
more completely under control. 
The objections to the association of drill in 
writing, in spelling, in grammar, and in compo- 
sitions are of like kind. It may be granted that 
there is something in the fact that literature repre- 
sents the most effective use of language, and is, all 
things considered, the most interesting kind of 
writing. Still this does not constitute a sufficient 
reason why the burden, and in all too many cases 
the odium, of teaching these things should attach 
to literature. It is a perfidious breaking of the 
promise of literature, or of any art, which should 
keep as much as possible of the atmosphere of 
play. Of course, drill in language and in written 
expression should be attached to every subject in 
the elementary curriculum; and this not only for 
the sake of relieving the literature from a burden 
of unattractive tasks, but because of the fact that 
the literary style and vocabulary are not good for 
all subjects and purposes, and the children should 
not be trained exclusively in these. On the large 
scale of things, it is a pity at any stage of the 
child’s education to identify “English” with liter- 
ature, since there is and should be so much 
English that is not literature, and so much litera- 
ture that is not English. 
One of the pleasantest and most profitable co-
-P-A-G-E-276
268 Literature in the Elementary School 
operations of literature is with the training in 
languages other than the vernacular. In those 
elementary classes where the children have in- 
struction in either German or French—or, for 
the matter of that, in Spanish or Italian—every 
effort should be made in their use of story and 
verse to secure the characteristic and universal 
literary effect. The German lyric has all the 
beauty of music and of image that the English 
has; the French fairy-play has most of elements 
of dramatic art that the children could use in 
English translation. 
A few of the fallacies of correlation, or mere 
co-relation, of literature with other aspects of the 
children’s school experience are these: 
The fallacy of setting out to teach children the 
love of home, or country, or nature, or animals, 
by teaching them literature that expresses or 
reflects those emotions. 
The love of one’s own country must be in our 
day a thing of slow and gradual growth. Our 
feelings about our country should arise out of 
our knowledge of the heroic things in her history, 
out of the noble plans for her growth, out of the 
generous things she provides for her children and 
the children of other lands. Out of this or some 
such basis arises the emotion of patriotism, a 
poem or a story which reflects this emotion has
-P-A-G-E-277
  Correlations of Literature 269 
some such back-ground by implication. To hunt 
about for a poem or story which teaches patriot- 
ism is a putting of the cart before the horse. 
First arouse in your children the emotion—an 
original personal emotion of their own, growing 
out of the legitimate background; then, if per- 
chance you are so fortunate as to find a poem or a 
story which also reflects this emotion, and which 
is at the same time good as art, you are so much 
the richer. The children will find their own feel- 
ing reinforced and nobly expressed, and conse- 
quently deepened and dignified. 
The same thing is true as to the love of ani- 
mals. If the children have the literature first, 
or only the literature, they may have only a 
second-hand and perfunctory love of the beasts. 
But first give your grade a dog, or a cat, or a 
canary; or give your child in the country a pony, 
or a lamb, or a pig; that they may feel at first 
hand the throb of dramatic brotherhood, of 
humorous kinship, that constitutes love of ani- 
mals. Then, when, judging by the proper canons 
that test good literature, you find a piece that 
reflects and deepens this, it is so much pure gain. 
The same thing is true of nature. The chil- 
dren should have many things that reflect feelings 
about nature and natural phenomena, and that 
give the interpretations which great and gifted
-P-A-G-E-278
  270 ©6Literature in the Elementary School 
artists have made of these things. But one should 
no more go to literature for creating first-hand 
love of nature than he would go to the same 
source for facts about any specific phenomenon 
in nature. Of course, this is not saying that we 
demand that a child shall have had a previous 
experience of every image and phenomenon of 
nature that is presented to him in literature. In- 
deed, we expect literature to complement and sup- 
plement life in the matter of imagery; to deepen 
and to arouse experience in the matter of emo- 
tion. But the fallacy lies in choosing literature 
on this ground, and in depending upon literature 
to create at first hand what is, and should be, an 
extra-literary feeling. Now, from time to time 
there comes the teacher’s way one of those rare 
chances when he finds the time, the place, and the 
poem all together, as when on some March day 
of thaw he can teach “The cock is crowing,” of 
Wordsworth; on the first morning of hoar-frost 
he can read “The Frost;” on another day, “The 
Wind’’—the things that harmonize with the spirit 
of an experience. 
Another of the fallacies of correlation is the 
determined, if not violent, association of the work 
in literature with the festivals. As a matter of 
fact, there is not much more than time in certain 
schools to teach the younger children the things
-P-A-G-E-279
Correlations of Literature 271 
they are expected to know about Thanksgiving, 
Christmas, Washington’s birthday, Easter, June. 
The work for the next celebration begins just as 
soon as the foregoing one is past. The partition- 
ing of the year into these very emphatic sections, 
and the carrying of the children through the same 
round year after year, are-questions too general 
to be treated here. But we are interested in the 
fact that in most cases the specimens of literature 
that can be considered applicable to the festivals 
would never be chosen from out the world of 
things for their absolute value as literature, nor 
for their peculiar suitability for the children. So 
it comes about that the children—the younger 
classes, at least—spend as much as two-thirds of 
their time at second- or third-rate specimens of 
literature. 
There is not much reason for protesting in our 
day against that species of correlating literature 
with something else which consists in teaching 
in connection with this literature things that the 
children ought to know later, regardless of their 
immediate fitness or acceptability ; as for example 
the facts of Greek mythology, the characters and 
plots of Shakespeare’s plays; we can never be 
too grateful for that interpretation of childhood 
and of education which has made this hereafter 
impossible. At the same time, if we choose wisely  
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 Literature in the Elementary School 
now, choose in the light of our best knowledge, 
the children will be glad all their lives to know 
the things we choose for them. 
The connection of literature with history is 
a many-sided question, and is not easily disposed 
of. Asa matter of fact, the partnership between 
history and literature, so vaguely asserted and so 
complaisantly accepted in many quarters, is a 
combination in which the literature has usually 
gone to the wall. Indeed, the practical adjust- 
ment of history and literature wavers about be- 
tween two equally fallacious schemes. One of 
these is to give the children the literature pro- 
duced by the nation whose history they are study- 
ing; as for example, the Homeric poems when 
they study the history of Greece, that they may 
imbibe the true Greek spirit from the poems. 
Now, children of elementary age cannot distin- 
guish, or even unconsciously feel, a national spirit 
in a poem. It is the broadly human, the univer- 
sally true, elements and spirit that they feel. Be- 
sides, the Greek national spirit, the spirit of the 
characteristic Greek period, was not Homeric, and 
the literature of the characteristic Greek period 
would never do for the elementary children. In 
the case of Greek literature one cannot unre- 
servedly demur because the Homeric poems are 
never bad for the children. But the same prin-
-P-A-G-E-281
  Correlations of Literature 273 
ciple applied to other nations and their literature 
may bring disaster. 
The other scheme for ort history and liter- 
ature is to choose the literature on the basis of 
the fact that it deals with some person or event 
or period with which the history is concerned; 
as, when we have a class in the history of the 
Plymouth colony, we give them Longfellow’s 
“The Courtship of Miles Standish” for litera- 
ture, which, except for one or two picturesque 
scenes, one would never choose as literature for 
young. children; and as, when we study the 
American Revolution, we give them as literature 
some mature and sentimental modern novel, or 
some sensational and untrustworthy juvenile, 
choosing these merely because they profess to in- 
corporate events connected with the historical 
period. 
The whole matter of the historical romance is 
important and complicated—too complicated and 
involving too many critical principles to be 
handled here. It must be sufficient to say in this 
connection what is sufficiently obvious to any 
thoughtful critic—that he who takes up and 
handles legitimately and justly an epoch, an 
event, or a group of historical persons, and at the 
same time produces good literature, is a master 
and produces a masterpiece—much too mature
-P-A-G-E-282
  274 Literature in the Elementary School 
and developed for elementary children. Only 
Scott possessed the faculty of keeping generally 
in sight of his history, or of segregating it in an 
occasional longeur, and adding to it a rattling 
good story. But Scott is too mature and complex 
for elementary children up to the very oldest, and 
they are not likely to be studying the periods in 
history that interested him. 
No, the kinship between history and litera- 
ture, and the co-operations between them in the 
children’s experience, are not of this external and 
artificial kind. It is for the mature and philo- 
sophical student to study literature as a culture 
product—its relation to the country and the times 
that produced it. It is for much older students 
to read the great romances, like Tolstoy’s War 
and Peace, that adequately mirror an epoch or an 
epoch-making event. 
For the children there is a deeper spiritual 
kinship between history and literature. It has to 
do with the personal and dramatic side, the biog- 
raphy and adventure of history. It lies in the 
spirit and atmosphere of human achievement, in 
the identity of the motives that express them- 
selves in literature and in actual accomplishment. 
When we study the pioneer and the colonist—the 
born and doomed colonist—we find his kinsman 
and prototype in Robinson Crusoe. When we |
-P-A-G-E-283
Correlations of Literature 275 
study the Revolution, the revolt against unjust 
laws, the protest of democracy against class- 
oppression, we find the spirit of Robin Hood. 
I hasten to disclaim any intention of advising 
these particular combinations. The examples 
should merely serve to make clear certain aspects 
of the kinship of spirit between literature and 
history. Of course one does now and again, and 
as it were, by special grace, find a story or a 
poem—like the “Concord Hymn,” or “Marion’s 
Men,” or “The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers” 
—precisely apropos of his event and beautifully 
adapted to his literary needs. And one often 
comes upon a historical document—like The 
Oregon Trail or The Autobiography of Benja- 
min Franklin—so picturesque and concrete, so 
observant of effects of unity and harmony, so 
full of appeals to the imagination, and so effective 
in verbal expression, as to yield many of the 
effects of literature. 
In spite of all protests against forced and mis- 
taken associations of literature with other subjects 
in school, we must constantly insist that it is no 
isolated thing, detached from life. On the con- 
trary, literature arises out of life, and is always 
arising out of it and reacting upon it. It is effect- 
ive and practically operative in a child’s life 
precisely because it, too, is life. It is closer,
-P-A-G-E-284
  276 Literature in the Elementary School 
therefore, to his business and bosom than any item 
or system of knowledge could be. It is not to 
disturb its trustworthiness and value to say that 
it does not primarily convey information and can- 
not be called upon to deliver facts. It does render 
truth and wisdom, the summary and essence of 
fact and knowledge. It does not destroy its edu- 
cational value to say that we shall search it in 
vain for a body or a system of organized disci- 
pline; for, since it is art, it disciplines while it 
charms and teaches us while it sets us free. 
The natural correlations of literature are with 
the other arts, but, above all, with the spirit of 
childhood, and with the consciousness of chil- 
dren; with the tone and spirit of their other work, 
rather than with its actual subject-matter.

CHAPTER XVII 
LITERATURE OUT OF SCHOOL AND READING OTHER 
THAN LITERATURE 
Were it not for appearing captious or extrava- 
gant, one would like to say that in these days of 
cheap and easy books, and amidst the temptations 
of the free libraries, the problem is that of keep- 
ing the children from reading too much, rather 
than of inducing them to read enough. This is 
particularly true of children in our large Ameri- 
can cities, whom we must, in our first generation 
of city-dwelling, guard against eye-strain, and 
nerve-strain, and library-air, and physical inac- 
tivity of all sorts. Luckily, our generation has 
learned some things about the educational pro- 
cesses that have tended to lessen materially the 
danger of over-reading. In many homes, and to 
many children out of school, books and maga- 
zines have hitherto been a sort of opiate, from the 
point of view of the child deadening the hungry 
sensibilities and lulling the stifled activities; and 
from the point of view of the parent securing 
silence and providing an apparently innocuous 
occupation. This is all too little changed now, 
though more and more homes are providing op- 
277 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  278 Literature in the Elementary School 
portunity and encouragement for other occupa- 
tions: shop and studio, and more abundant 
material and opportunity for play. In the cities 
the public playgrounds and gymnasiums—and all 
too rarely the public workshop and studio for 
children—begin to share with the public library 
the task of safely taking care of the children out 
of school. 
But there will always be time for reading, 
and by all means the legitimate share of the chil- 
dren’s time should be given to it. The so-called 
supplementary reading given them by the school 
is largely, I take it, a question of the much read- 
ing that will make the process easier, and not a 
matter of accumulating facts, or of acquiring a 
wider knowledge of literature. In many schools 
that I have observed it is often unwisely and 
carelessly chosen, so far as the literary share of it 
is concerned. It should be selected partly for its 
bearing upon the fact-studies, and not wholly 
made up of things of the literary kind. The 
bearings of the question of the school’s supple- 
mentary reading are not literary, or, so far as 
they are, they have been discussed in other con- 
nections. 
Every child should ideally have free access to 
a collection of books got together with reference 
to his needs and tastes. It may be serviceable to
-P-A-G-E-287
  
Literature Out of School 279 
indicate the kind and number of books that might 
be included in such a library of a child up to his 
fourteenth year. 
There should be in such a collection several 
biographies. On the whole, let them be of the 
older, idealizing type, not of the modern young 
university instructor’s virtuously iconoclastic type. 
Children get at their history first through heroic 
and dramatic figures and events. In their earlier 
years it is the imagination that appropriates the 
images and events of history. It is therefore only 
good pedagogy to present the figures on their 
heroic and ideal side. Let these biographies in- 
clude the record of different sorts of men—a 
statesman, a pioneer, a preacher, a soldier, an 
explorer, an inventor, a missionary, a business 
man, a man of letters—so that many types of 
character and kinds of experience may be 
reflected. 
As the children grow older, they will dip into 
history for the images—the persons and de- 
tachable events. The search for facts and 
philosophy will come many years later. Some 
tempting books of history should appear on their 
shelves; The Dutch Republic, The Conquest of 
Mexico, Parkman’s romantic narratives, and John 
Fiske’s; if possible the illustrated edition of 
Green’s History of the English People. Most of
-P-A-G-E-288
  280 Literature in the Elementary School 
the history they get from their own reading, how- 
ever, should be what they get from the biogra- 
phies of the central figures in the events— 
Columbus, William of Orange, Francis Drake, 
and all the other picturesque and heroic persons. 
Other historical reading would best be done under 
guidance and in connection with the work in 
school. 
There should be a few books of travel and 
exploration. Among these there should be some 
of the original sources, if possible the Bradford 
Journal, the Jesuit Relations, the Lewis and Clark 
Journals. Froissart and Marco Polo should be 
included; the fable-making travelers perform a 
very useful function. To these may be added a 
few most recent explorations—African, Arctic, 
Andean, Thibetan. 
Children, barring the exceptional child, will 
not read formal science; but it may develop or 
help on a desirable taste and interest to have some 
of the many pretty out-door books in their col- 
lection—not romances of the wild, but simpler 
treatises about the things to be found in the door- 
yard and the home woodland. And when a child 
develops a taste or a gift in any scientific direc- 
tion, he should have access, as easy as possible, 
to some good reference books suited to his needs. 
All children should have access to some of the
-P-A-G-E-289
Literature Out of School 281 
more popular technical and scientific journals 
which give interesting accounts of current dis- 
coveries and inventions. 
By way of nature and animal books we will 
include the Jungle Books, an expurgated edition 
of Reynard the Fox, Aesop's Fables, and, of 
course, Uncle Remus. Other  semi-scientific 
nature-writers will doubtless appear in most col- 
lections of children’s books—and may do no 
harm. 
A book of Greek myth seriously and beauti- 
fully told should be accessible. No other myth is 
so beautiful or so imaginative, or so artistically 
put together. The children do not need to have 
to do with many myths until they know something 
about interpreting them. Of course, they should 
have access to the Bible in some attractive form. 
A large illustrated edition—Doré’s or Tissot’s— 
will please and instruct them from their earliest 
days. This is one of the cases in which pictures— 
good and imaginative pictures—form a desirable 
gateway into a realm where the children are not 
naturally at home, and where they need the help of 
a great and serious artist in finding their way. Of 
course, poor and materialistic pictures are a mis- 
fortune, especially those that attempt to body forth 
preternatural events and supernatural beings. 
Doré’s pictures are not undesirable, because they
-P-A-G-E-290
  282 Literature in the Elementary School 
often help a child to a noble and imaginative con- 
ception of a thing he is himself powerless to con- 
struct; while Tissot’s are good because they set 
forth with beauty and richness of detail the many 
phases of life which the child must try to image 
in reading the Hebrew stories—from the nomadic 
simplicity of the saga of pastoral Abraham to 
the luxurious refinements of the Romanized and 
cosmopolitan Jerusalem. 
The little scholar should find on his shelves 
Lanier’s King Arthur, Pyle’s Robin Hood, Palm- 
er’s Odyssey, some translation of the Iliad; in 
short, some form of each of the great hero-tales; 
a selected few of Scott’s romances—Ivanhoe, 
Quentin Durward, Guy Mannering, Anne of 
Geierstein; a few of Cooper’s; Robinson Crusoe, 
Don Quixote, William Morris’ prose tales, a pair 
of Quiller-Couch’s, and as many of Joseph Con- 
rad’s; these might constitute his romances. But 
unless he is a very unusual child, he will never 
read in these masters, if he is given masses of 
cheap and easy reading, such as the Henty books 
and the Alger series; or if he finds in his mother’s 
sitting-room a stack of “the season’s best sellers” 
and the ten-cent magazines. The cheap and easy 
style and the commonplace material of this sort 
of books offer the line of least resistance to the 
young reader. They flow into his mind without
-P-A-G-E-291
  Literature Out of School 283 
effort on his part, while, if he would apprehend 
the masters, he must actively co-operate with 
them at every step, arousing his best powers to 
comprehend their expressions and to grasp their 
ideas. One would hesitate to say that there is 
absolutely no use for books of the Henty and 
Alger type. One can imagine a child whose every 
bent was against reading, being enticed to begin 
by some such easy and commonplace experience. 
And one can imagine their being useful to wean 
children away from really vicious books. In a 
certain boys’ club I know, organized in a social 
settlement, which was really a reorganization of a 
gang, these particular books were for a year or 
so an acceptable substitute for the bloody 
romances they had been reading. Many of those 
boys have never passed beyond them; but to 
many others they were, as was hoped, stepping- 
stones to better things. There is no place for 
them in the ideal collection of children’s books. 
Certain books, harmless and as recreation even 
desirable, will inevitably make their appearance 
on the children’s shelves—Miss Alcott’s, Mrs. 
Richards’, and others of the many series of girls’ 
books and boys’ books; they are doubtless inno- 
cent enough, and to be discouraged only when 
they keep the children from something better 
worth while; to be encouraged, on the other hand,
-P-A-G-E-292
  284 Literature in the Elementary School 
only for those children who must be tempted by 
easy reading into any habit of using books. To 
be sure, you will probably find that your child has 
found one of them, perhaps a whole series, to 
which for a certain period she seems to have 
given her whole heart; but if treated with wis- 
dom this symptom will disappear, and you will 
find her at some surprisingly early day re-reading 
the tournament at Ashby, and patronizingly 
alluding to the time when she was enslaved to 
“The Little General” series, or the “Under the 
Roses” or the “Eight Half-Sisters” series, or any 
other particular juveniles, as “when I was a 
child.” 
In the matter of fairy-tales one must discrimi- 
nate and renounce quite resolutely. It is not good 
for a child who has early mastered that edged 
tool of reading to have access to all fairy-tales 
and all kinds of fairy-tales. Eschew all the 
modern ones. Of course, if you have a personal 
friend who has written a book of them, for 
reasons other than literary your children will 
read them. But as to those you choose freely for 
them let them have Grimm and Perrault, and the 
Arabian Nights, and after a while Andersen; 
which, together with what they will pick up here 
and there in magazines and in their friends’ 
houses, will be enough.
-P-A-G-E-293
  Literature Out of School 285 
For poetry, the child should have on his own 
shelves some pretty edition of the Nursery 
Rhymes, The Child’s Garden, some really good 
collection of little things—The Posy Ring, for 
example, Henley’s Lyra Heroica, Lang’s The Blue 
Poetry Book, Allingham’s Book of Ballads. For 
the rest he should be read to from the poets them- 
selves, and as soon as he is old enough, sent to 
the volumes of the poets for his reading. As in 
school so at home the children should hear their 
poetry read until they acquire some real degree of 
expertness as readers. Children who can not 
understand at all, poetry which they read silently, 
will delight in it read aloud. 
This little collection should contain the classic 
nonsense, but not all kinds of inartistic fooling 
and rude fun. There should be Alice in Wonder- 
land and Through the Looking-Glass (always the 
one with Tenniel’s pictures). We must re- 
member that Alice is very delicate art, and that 
its final and deepest appeal is to the mature per- 
son. Certain very imaginative children take to 
it as a fanciful tale at the moment of ripeness; 
others miss it then, and must wait until the won- 
derful dream-psychology of it, and the delicate 
satire of its parodies can make their appeal to 
them as older persons. Lear’s Nonsense Rhymes 
in judicious doses every child should have; “John
-P-A-G-E-294
  286 Literature in the Elementary School 
Gilpin’s Ride;” certain of the Bab Ballads; a 
little of Oliver Heresford’s delightful foolishness. 
Among the folk- and fairy-tales he will find many 
comic bits whose kind or degree of humor will 
suit him admirably in his younger years. In 
Clouston’s Book of Noodles may be found a 
mine of such funny tales. The Peterkin Papers 
is the best of modern noodle-tales. No family 
can be brought up without the help of Strewel 
Peter, nor should they miss Little Black Sambo. 
Most American children are enchanted with the 
fun of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn though one 
must sadly acknowledge that it is woven into 
back-grounds of a sensational kind not at all im- 
proving to an unformed taste. 
One cannot feel that parodies are in general 
good for children; though, after they have had 
a good share of serious enjoyment out of their 
fairy-tales, and especially if they seem too much 
or too long absorbed in them, they ought to have 
The Rose and the Ring and Prince Prigio. 
Picture-books and illustrated books are an- 
other independent little problem. It is a curious 
fact that it is not the beautiful lithographs of 
birds and animals, flocks and landscapes, children 
in irreproachable Russian dresses and short socks, 
seated in the corner of ancestral mahogany sofas, 
refreshing themselves from antique silver por-
-P-A-G-E-295
Literature Out of School 287 
ringers, that the little living heads hang over by 
the hour on the nursery floor. It is much more 
likely to be the thunderous landscapes of the old 
Dutch woodcuts in Great-grandmama’s Bible, the 
queer, chaotic, symbolistic plates of the Mother- 
Play; the wonderful prints of Comenius’ Orbis 
Pictus; the casualties of John Leech’s hunting 
fields. True, they delight in the charming details of 
all Kate Greenaway’s books; and Walter Crane’s 
pictures so rich in color and beautiful detail give 
ceaseless joy; but one must confess that they are 
a bit inclined to “shy” at pictures they know to be 
intended for them. Every nursery that can com- 
pass it should have as many as possible of the 
books illustrated in color by Boutet de Monvel. 
The children should never see comic illustrations 
of their nursery rhymes and stories. They are 
all banal as wit and trashy as art, substituting an 
ugly and distorted image for the possibly beauti- 
ful one the child might have made for himself. 
After they have passed out of infancy, they do 
not need pictures in their stories. The black- 
and-white print is inadequate when color and 
movement should be a part of the image, and 
children should have the discipline of relying en- 
tirely on themselves in visualizing the images of 
the text. There should also be in the “little 
library,” or accessible to the little readers in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  288 Literature in the Elementary School 
big one, beside the illustrated Bible, the one big 
volume of Shakespeare with Gilbert’s pictures— 
an inexhaustible mine of life and art; Engelmann 
and Anderson’s Atlas of the Homeric Poems, a 
Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, and an ency- 
clopedia that the older children can use, should 
have a place on these shelves. 
It is so often said as to amount to a mere con- 
vention that the best possible literary experience 
for a child is to be turned loose to browse (they 
always say “browse”) in a grown-up library. 
One always finds a malicious pleasure in detect- 
ing in these people (and they are always to be 
found in great plenty) those baby impressions, 
still uncorrected that they got of many books 
in the course of their browsing. Of course, in 
a house where there are many books the chil- 
dren will experiment, will taste of many dishes, 
and possibly devour many things not intended 
for them. From some of these they will 
take no serious harm, while in many other cases 
they will get a permanent warp of judgment or of 
feeling. It would seem to me wise to guide the 
child in his explorations, giving him plenty of 
those grown-up things that you believe to be good 
for him, and heading him off as long as possible 
from the others. For all your caution, however, 
children will be found buried in Tom Jones,
-P-A-G-E-297
  Literature Out of School 289 
mousing about in Montaigne, chuckling over 
Tristram Shandy, and befuddling themselves with 
Ghosts and Anna Karénina. In these cases we 
can only hope that nature has mercifully ordained 
that, not having the necessary apperception ex- 
perience, they will not get at the real truth of 
these books, and that they will have the luck— 
rare, to be sure—to remove and correct their mis- 
taken impressions in some subsequent reading. 
The ideal co-operation between home, school, 
Sunday school, and library is yet to be brought 
about; teacher and parents can do much to pro- 
mote it. As a step toward this co-operation they 
should provide every child who reads in a library 
with a list of books. The imaginative books in 
the list given out by the public libraries are practi- 
cally all juveniles, apparently chosen mainly for 
the purpose of amusing children who have no 
books in their homes. These things are un- 
doubtedly amusing; they are superficially appe- 
tizing ; and they have the same effect that the soda 
fountain at the corner drug-shop has upon the 
children’s appetite for true nourishment—they 
take the edge off his hunger so that he has no 
relish for his bread and butter, though he has had 
nothing to eat but a hint of cheap flavor, a dash 
of formaldehyde, a spoonful of poor milk, and a 
giassful of effervescence. The lists given by
-P-A-G-E-298
  290 Laterature in the Elementary School 
parents and teachers may change all this, but only 
if they include good things, beautiful and inter- 
esting enough to make these wasteful juveniles 
seem unattractive. 
Every schoolroom in which the children are 
old enough to be interested, and every family 
should devise a method of digesting the news of 
the world every day or every week, so that the 
children may have some knowledge of current 
events. Of course, there are children who can- 
not be kept from reading the morning paper— 
crimes, sports, and all. Such a child’s family 
should choose its newspaper with all possible care. 
Every self-respecting family where there are chil- 
dren should be willing to submit to the very 
small sacrifice of foregoing the Sunday paper, 
to save the little people from the flood of com- 
monplace, of triviality, and of ribaldry that over- 
whelms them from these monstrous productions. 
Perhaps no well-brought-up child would be 
quite well equipped if he has not had The Youth’s 
Companion and St. Nicholas in his childhood; 
but it is a mistake to let them linger too long in 
these periodicals, whose contents are somewhat 
fragmentary as literature, and not quite large 
enough or full enough as to current events and 
interests. It is wise to turn the children as soon 
as possible to the mature and more thorough |
-P-A-G-E-299
  Literature Out of School 291 
magazines, among which should be included 
a technical and scientific journal. By all means 
do not subject them to the temptation of the 
various story-magazines—those cheap and easy 
chronicles of the questionable affairs of under- 
graduates and chorus girls, of Nietzschean super- 
humanity gone to seed, of imitations of the 
imitated psychology of the wild, all rendered in 
the English of third-year college themes. If the 
adult members of the family must have these 
things, let them be kept, along with “the season’s 
best sellers,” out of easy reach of the children. 
It should not need to be said that there has 
been no attempt in the foregoing discussion to 
recommend every good thing, or to give an ex- 
haustive list of such things in any one line; no 
more has there been an effort to give warning 
of all things undesirable, but merely, as in the 
whole book, to state the underlying principles of 
choice, with just enough specific examples to 
make clear their application.
-P-A-G-E-300
  CHAPTER XVIII 
A COURSE IN LITERATURE FOR THE ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL 
The list of titles in literature given below must 
be taken as free suggestion, not at all as dogmatic 
requirement; least of all should it be regarded 
as an exhaustive and definitive programme. 
Throughout this little book there has been a 
deliberate effort to mention no more examples 
and specimens than would serve to support and 
illustrate the principles stated or the theories 
advanced, so as to keep out of it the wearing 
atmosphere of interminable lists, and to leave 
those who might accept the doctrines quite free to 
apply them in the selection of their own speci- 
mens. So now in the plan appended the titles 
have been carefully sifted and resolutely limited. 
It should not be necessary to say that it is not 
intended that all the specimens mentioned in any 
one year should be given within that year in every 
school—perhaps in any school; or that they 
should necessarily be given in the year to which 
they are here assigned. They are rather designed 
to indicate the kind of thing one would choose for 
the average classes in the average school, and to 
292
-P-A-G-E-301
  Elementary School Course 293 
suggest things that go well together. I have even 
ventured to hope that those who read the book 
will also take the pains to read all the specimens 
mentioned in the programme, so as to catch their 
spirit and atmosphere, and after that choose quite 
freely for themselves these or other titles. The 
field of choice is especially wide among the folk- 
tales; all those mentioned are good, and suitable 
for the places in which they are put. But there 
are others good and suitable, which may, indeed, 
better satisfy the needs of some special teacher 
or class. In some schools, no doubt, it will be 
well to give a third year of folk-tales and simple 
lyrics before beginning the hero-tales. In that 
case the whole course would be pushed along a 
year, making for the last or eighth year a combi- 
nation of bits taken from the seventh and eighth 
years suggested here. The course is planned for 
a school whose children go on into high school; 
though one can see little reason for a different 
course in literature for those children who stop 
with a grammar-school education. What we 
covet for such children is not knowledge of much 
literature, nor knowledge of any literature in par- 
ticular, but a taste for wholesome books and 
some trustworthy habits of reading. These 
results are best secured when a few suitable and 
beautiful things have been lovingly taught 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
294 Literature in the Elementary School 
and joyfully apprehended. Children thus pro- 
vided will keep on reading ; if they have been really 
fed on Julius Caesar or The Tempest they will 
hunger for more Shakespeare; if they have taken 
delight in Treasure Island they will pursue 
Stevenson and find Scott and Cooper. The 
chances for implanting in them some living and 
abiding love of books are much better if we teach 
them in school the things they may easily master 
and completely contain, than if we try to supply 
them with what only an adult reader can expect 
to appropriate, which therefore takes on the 
character of a task, or remains in their minds a 
mere chaotic mass. 
The plan of the course is simple and obvious 
enough. Indeed, the main idea is first of all 
merely that of putting into each year such things 
as will delight and train a child of that age in liter- 
ary ways. With this is joined the equally simple 
and reasonable purpose of giving in each year an 
acceptable variety looking toward the develop- 
ment of a generous taste—a story, a heroic poem, 
a musical lyric or two, a bit of fun, a group of 
fables. Throughout the programme there has 
been a conscious attempt to use things every 
teacher knows or may very easily find, and of 
associating things that harmonize in spirit. 
For the first two years the folk-tales form the 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  Elementary School Course 205 
core of the course. To the folk-tales is joined 
a group of simple lyrics, many of them the more 
formal and expressive of the traditionary rhymes. 
As a matter of course, in a school where these 
first- and second-year children have not already 
had in kindergarten or in the home nursery the 
simpler rhymes and jingles—“Little Boy Blue,” 
“Jack Horner,” “There Was a Man in Our 
Town’—they should be taught. 
In the third year Robinson Crusoe constitutes 
the large core. As suggested in another chapter 
it is well to treat this story as if it were a cycle, 
taking it in episodes, and interweaving with it 
other bits of literature which harmonize with it, 
either reinforcing it or counteracting it. It may 
easily happen that a teacher would select a quite 
different group of poems for study along with 
Robinson Crusoe, according as he emphasized 
some other aspect of the story and according to 
the maturity of his children. This programme 
assumes a pretty mature third-year group. It 
may be in many schools well to transfer, as I have 
suggested, this whole arrangment to the fourth 
year. 
The fifth- and sixth-year work is arranged 
upon a similar plan—that of constituting a story 
or a story-cycle the center of the work, and asso- 
ciating with it shorter and supplementary bits.
-P-A-G-E-304
  296 Literature in the Elementary School 
While the poems in both cases are such as 
harmonize in subject or idea with aspects of the 
two stories that will inevitably appear in the 
teaching, they have not been chosen solely from 
that point of view; they are also in every case 
beautiful as detached poems, and ideally, at 
least, suitable for the children. Every experi- 
enced teacher will have other verses and stories 
in mind which may be added to those given or 
substituted for them. Some of them will be use- 
ful, not as class studies necessarily, but as a part 
of that “reserve stock” that every teacher has, 
from which he draws from time to time some- 
thing to read to his class which they are not 
expecting. 
In the programme for the sixth year an alterna- 
tive is suggested. Many teachers will find enough 
in the Arthur stories to form the core of the 
literature for the year. Others will find material 
for the whole year’s stories in the Norwegian and 
Icelandic sagas. Many will not like the sugges- 
tion of giving the antidote of the chivalric 
romances—Don Quixote. Many will prefer to 
drop hero-tales and romances in favor of more 
modern stories. Such a group of stories is sug- 
gested introducing the stories that call for 
interpretation, and the apprehending of a second- 
ary meaning. This paves the way for the stories
-P-A-G-E-305
Se wee Ss aE Te mT ys, oe ene ae 
Elementary School Course 297 
of the seventh year which call for some genuine 
literary interpretation. In the seventh year pro- 
gramme the two dramatic bits of Yeats’s are 
suggested, not only because they are charming 
in themselves, and are in charming artistic con- 
trast, but because they can easily be staged and 
acted, and are full-of suggestion of the kind of 
thing the children can do themselves. The Pot 
of Broth is the dramatization of a well-known 
folk-droll, and The Hour-Glass is a morality 
calling for no complexity of dialogue, of staging, 
or of dramatic motive—the kind of play the chil- 
dren can most easily produce both as literature 
and as acting. 
As suggested in a previous chapter, during 
this and the following year each child should be 
encouraged or required to learn a poem or a story 
of his own choosing, which he presents to the 
class. This will greatly enrich the class pro- 
gramme. Only one fable is suggested—one of 
Fontaine’s, the interpretation or moral of which 
should now be given by the class; many other 
fables may be used in the same way, if this exer- 
cise seems to be profitable. 
As very gbserver of schools knows, it is the 
eighth-year children who need most accommoda- 
tion and understanding. The programme offered 
is designed for the normal class in the average 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  298 Literature in the Elementary School 
school—when the children are really passing into 
the secondary stage and should be preparing to go 
into high school without crossing a chasm. But 
it may need much modification for those eighth- 
year classes in which there are belated children 
and unevenly developed children. It is quite 
possible that Julius Caesar, The Tempest, and 
Sohrab and Rustum may prove impracticable 
for such a class, and that something easier would 
have to be substituted. In no case can we hope 
to teach the two plays exhaustively, either as 
regards their form or their content. But both 
these plays are of that kind of great art that tas 
many levels to which one may climb in turn, with 
his growing maturity. And the beauty of both 
these plays is that in case the class is precocious 
and does inquire deeply into them, there is nothing 
in the political philosophy of Julius Caesar 
or in the spiritual and social philosophy of The 
Tempest that may not be safely explained to 
them. This programme makes no mention, as 
may be seen, of the many minor lyrics and bits 
of drama and story that will be added from many 
sources and in many connections: from their 
home reading; from the teacher’s reserve stock; 
from their reading lessons; from their work in 
other languages; from their preparation for festi- 
vals and celebrations; from suggestions of —
-P-A-G-E-307
  Elementary School Course 299 
weather and season; from occasional current 
periodicals, and possibly from other sources. 
And when all is said, one must say again that 
there cannot be a strictly normalized and fixed 
curriculum in literature since in this subject more 
than in any other the personnel of the class must 
be considered ; their typical inheritance, their tra- 
dition, their social grade, their community, their 
other interests, their passing preoccupation and 
almost their daily mood, are factors in the prob- 
lem. The teacher who is sensitive to these mat- 
ters in his class will soon emancipate himself 
from the fixed curriculum. Let him at the same 
time be sensitive to the emphasis and appeal of 
each bit of art he chooses for them, and he can- 
not fail. Whatever his results they will be good.

Anyone who has read these eighteen chapters 
should find himself provided with a set of max- 
ims and injunctions among which will be the 
following: 
1. Choose the literature for the children under 
the guidance of those principles by which you 
test any literature. 
2. Remember that literature is art; it must 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
  Elementary School Course 305 
be taught as art, and the result should be an 
artistic one. 
3. Never teach a thing you do not love and 
admire. But learn to suspect that when you do 
not love it the fault is in you, and is curable. 
4. According to the best light you have, choose 
those things that are fitted for the children— 
corresponding to their experience, or awakening 
in them experiences you would like them to have. 
5. Teach your chosen bit of literature accord- 
ing to its nature and genius. Study it so sympa- 
thetically that you can follow its hints, and make 
its emphases. Teach each piece for its character- 
istic effect, and do not try to teach everything in 
any one piece. 
6. Be contented to read with the children a 
limited number of things. You cannot read every 
delightful and helpful thing. You can only intro- 
duce them to literature and teach them to love it. 
7. When you have led your class, or half your 
class, into a vital and personal love of literature 
and set their feet on the long path of the reader’s 
joy, you have done them the best service 
you can perform as a teacher of literature.

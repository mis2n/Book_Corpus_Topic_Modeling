This book, as its title indicates, is a discussion of prin- 
ciples and methods of teaching arithmetic. A complete 
study of methods of teaching any subject involves two 
things (a) A study of guiding principles, and (b) A 
study of the details of method—of possible methods of 
presenting the various parts of the subject. 
The best place to study the details of method is in con- 
nection with a review of subject matter, but such a study 
should be preceded or accompanied by a study of general 
principles. It is the purpose of this book to do three 
things (a) To give a clear conception of the ends to be 
accomplished through the work in arithmetic (b) To 
analyze the teaching of arithmetic into the different kinds 
or types of teaching that occur in the subject and to give 
an understanding of guiding principles and a knowledge 
of possible methods of procedure, tools and devices to be 
used in each of these types; and (c) To make clear, by 
means of numerous illustrations and lesson plans, how 
these general principles and methods of procedure apply 
to the teaching of the particular subject of arithmetic. 
The material of this book has all been developed and 
used in the author’s classes during the last six years, and 
is presented here in book form in the hope that it may 
contribute something toward improving and standardizing 
the teaching of arithmetic. It is believed that this book 
will be found suitable for use as a text for normal schools 
and teachers’ reading circles. 
The author wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to 
the books referred to in the text and bibliographies, to

CHAPTER I 
THE ENDS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH 
THE TEACHING OF ARITHMETIC 
THE Importance or A DeFiniTe AND Correct CONCEPTION 
oF THE ENDS 
Successful teaching of arithmetic is impossible unless 
the teacher and supervisor have a correct and clearly 
formulated conception of the ends they are trying to 
realize through their teaching of the subject. This truth 
is so self-evident as to be axiomatic, but in spite of 
this fact many teachers of the subject have only a vague 
idea of what they are trying to do. Perhaps the majority 
of teachers have no object in view except to so teach that 
their pupils will be able to work the problems in the text 
from day to day and to pass examinations. Indefinite and 
mistaken ideas of the purpose of the work in arithmetic 
are responsible for more poor teaching of the subject than 
any other one thing. 
Waste. In the first place, without a definite conception 
of the ends to be attained, a teacher is not apt to accom- 
plish much of anything, certainly not what she should 
accomplish. _Purposeless teaching, or purposeless work of... 
any kind, is always exceedingly wasteful. In order to   oo an ret

obtain the maximum of results with a minimum of effort, 
the teacher must know exactly what results are wanted. 
What and How to Teach. In the second place, every 
thoughtful teacher of arithmetic is constantly confronted 
with two types of questions—what to teach and how to 
teach it. It is impossible to decide upon the relative 
importance of different topics and problems, or upon the 
relative merits of different methods, in any way except 
in terms of the ends to be accomplished. No one topic is. 
any more important than any other topic, in and of itself; 
no one method is intrinsically better than any other 
method. The most important topics and the best methods 
are those that will most nearly accomplish the ends sought. 
Measurement of Results. Finally, a clear conception of 
the ends that should be accomplished is necessary to enable 
the teacher to judge intelligently of the success of her 
work. The degree of approximation of the results actually 
obtained to the ends desired is the measure of teaching 
efficiency. The teacher who has only a vague idea of 
the aim of her instruction can form no adequate judgment 
as to its success, while the teacher who has a wrong con- 
ception of aims is very apt to form a wrong estimate of 
her work—to regard as entirely successful, work that is 
seen to be almost a total failure when judged in the light 
_y%f the proper aims. 
To summarize, it is essential that every teacher have a 
definite, correct, and usable idea of the ends sought through 
the instruction in arithmetic in -order to d) avoid waste, 
(b) intelligently select subject matter and method, and (¢) 
have a standard by which to judge results.

The Arithmetic of the Middle Ages. In order to see how 
the ends determine both the content and method of instruc- 
tion, one needs to study the history of the teaching of
-P-A-G-E-9

arithmetic. During the middle ages in Europe, the learn- 
ing was entirely in the hands of the priests. There were 
few schools except those conducted by the priests in mon- 
asteries. 
The course of study in these schools was usually confined 
to the trivium and quadrivium. The former comprised 
the three arts of grammar, logic, and rhetoric, but prac- 
tically meant the art of reading and writing Latin; the 
latter included arithmetic, geometry, music and astron- 
omy. The trivium and the quadrivium together consti- 
tuted the seven liberal arts. Any student who studied 
beyond the trivium was looked upon as a man of great 
erudition. Two things are of importance in this connec- 
tion, first, arithmetic was taught only to adults, and second, 
it was taught only to advanced scholars and men of learn- 
ing. These facts have had a great influence upon the 
teaching of the subject down to the present time. The 
men who taught and studied arithmetic in these schools 
were not interested in practical affairs and, as a result, 
they did not study the practical side of the subject but 
studied it simply as a science—the science of numbers. 
The arithmetic taught in the monastic schools was taken 
from the Greeks, the text.used beimtg.Boethius’ Latin trans- 
lation of the arithmetic of Nichomachus, a Jew who wrote 
under Greek influence. This book, besides discussing frac- 
tions, ratio, proportion and progressions, devoted much 
space to a consideration of different kinds of numbers. 
In addition to the classes that we know today, such as 
odd, even, prime and composite, there were many others. 
Among these were perfect, redundant, defective, triangular, 
square, pentagonal, pyramidal and cubical numbers.* 
  
*A perfect number is one that equals the sum of all its divisors 
except itself: thus, 6=1+-2+38, 28=1+2+4+7+14. A redundant num- 
ber is one the sum of whose divisors exceeds the number itself; thus 
the sum of the divisors of 18, 1+2+3+6+9, is greater than 18, and

4 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
When arithmetic was handed down to the elementary 
schools, it was dominated by the scientific, scholastic atti- 
tude of the middle ages. The chief aim was to teach the 
pupils the science of numbers. The subject matter was 
not practical and the methods and organization were those 
suited to mature scholars. The influence and results of 
this point of view are felt to the present day. 
Effect on Topics Taught. As the sole object was to im- 
part to the students-as much information as possible about 
the science of numbers, anything and everything that had 
to do with numbers was taught. As a result we find in 
early American arithmetics many topics that never were 
practical and many others that had long ceased to have 
any practical significance. Our early arithmetics con- 
tained such topics as G.C.D. by the Euclidean method, 
L.C.M., progressions, complex fractions, longitude and 
time, annual interest, exchange, chain rule, position, repeat- 
ing and circulating decimals, compound, distributive, and 
conjoined proportion, permutations and combinations, 
duodecimals, powers and roots, medial and alternate alli- 
gation, barter, rule of false position, single and double 
rule of three, partnership, partial payments, tonnage of 
vessels, general average, equation of payments, bankruptcy, 
present worth, true discount, practice and gauging. In 
short, they were compendiums of everything that had to 
do with numbers—their theory and application The prac- 
  
the sum of the divisors of 12, 1+2+3+4-+6, is greater than 12. A 
defective number is one the sum of whose divisors is less than the 
number; thus the sum of the divisors of 8, 1+2+4, is less than 8, and 
the sum of the divisors of 16, 1+2+4+8, is less than 16. Triangular 
pitt, a ° bi oO. 
numbers are 3= 9% , 8= 29,, 10= eno , etc. Square num- 
bers are 4= 88 , = 3 3 8 , ete. Four is the smallest pyramidal num- 
ber because four shot can be piled in the form of a pyramid, three on 
the bottom to form a triangular base and one on top. Five and ten 
are other pyramidal numbers. ;

tical value of a topic was never considered, if it concerned 
numbers it belonged in arithmetie, Many of the above 
topics have disappeared from our ‘arithmetics and even 
their names are unknown to the present generation, but 
others, unfortunately, are still present—in our arithmetics 
today simply because they were put in when arithmetic 
was everything pertaining to number and have been there 
ever since. 
Effect on Problems. As long as arithmetic was regarded 
as the science of numbers, the only requisite of a good 
problem was that it involve the desired number relations. 
So under the dominance of the scientific aim, the problems 
in the arithmetics were largely of the puzzle type. The 
following are typical examples taken from an old American 
arithmetic published in 1859. 
1. A man driving his geese to market, was met by 
another who said, “Good-morning with your hundred 
geese.” He replied, “I have not a hundred; but.if I had 
half as many more than I have, and two geese and a half, 
I should have a hundred.” How many had he? 
2. The head of a fish was 9 inches long; its tail was as 
long as‘its head and half its body, and its body was as 
long as its head and tail both. What was the whole length 
of the fish? 
Effect on Methods. The methods used in early American 
schools were largely those handed down from the middle 
ages when the subject was taught to adults and advanced 
scholars. No attempt was made to adapt the subject mat- 
ter or methods to the needs and abilities of the children, 
or to appeal to their interests and make the subject inter- 
esting. Arithmetic was taught simply as a body of facts 
and rules about numbers. These facts and rules were not 
usually proved or justified in any way but were given 
arbitrarily. The pupils first learned the rule and then 
solved a list of problems based on that rulé. 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
    6 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Effect on Organization. We have seen the effect of the 
scientific end on the methods of teaching and on the con- 
tent of arithmetic—the topics taught and the type of 
problems. It had just as marked an effect in another way 
in that it led to a logical organization of the subject 
matter—an organization according to the subject matter 
itself rather than according to the needs and abilities of 
the learner. This was but natural as it was worked out 
by mature minds for mature minds and the center of 
interest was the subject itself and not the learner. As a 
result the organization was topical. Texts usually started 
with a chapter on Notation and Numeration, in which the 
reading and writing of numbers was rather fully treated. 
This was followed, in order, by chapters on Addition, 
Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Properties of Num- 
bers (L.C.M., G.C.D., Tests of Divisibility, ete.), Common 
Fractions, Decimals, Denominate Numbers, Ratio and Pro- 
portion, Percentage, Application of Percentage, and Men- 
suration—each topic being fully treated before taking up 
the next. 
Tue Discrptinary END 
Definition. Since the scientific end led to the teaching of 
many topics in arithmetic that had no practical value, it 
was but natural, as the general public became better edu- 
cated and better acquainted with the work of our schools, 
that complaints should arise. This is exactly what hap- 
pened, and in order to defend the teaching of so much 
useless and obsolete material, educators called to their 
aid the psychological doctrine of formal discipline. This 
doctrine held that a (general power or ability may be 
acquired through the study of one subject and that once 
acquired, it will operate in full in any other subject or 
situation no matter how different the new situation may 
be from that in which the power was originally developed. , 
v
-P-A-G-E-13
  ENDS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED % 
The analogy was made to physical development. One may 
develop the muscles of the arm ,by swinging dumb bells, 
but after the muscles have been thus strengthened the 
increased strength can be used in driving nails or any 
other act in which the muscles of the arm are used. 
Under such a doctrine, it would make very little difference 
what is taught just so it is not too easy. Educators found 
in this doctrine their defense of the useless material that 
had accumulated in our arithmetics under the influence 
of the scientific end. Such material might not be of any 
practical use, they admitted, but it served to develop and 
train the mind. 
Effect on Topics. The aim of formal discipline did not 
change either the topics or the character of the problems 
from what they had been under the scientific end. Its 
effect was simply to defend and perpetuate all of the use- 
less and obsolete material that was then in our arithmetics. 
Some of this material, such as G.C.D. by division (Eu- 
clidean method), cube root, ete., never had any practical 
value for our students; other topics, such as Partnership 
and Partial Payments, had once been practical but had 
ceased to be so because of changes in business procedure. 
Effect on Problems. Since the aim was simply to de- 
velop the mind, the intricate puzzle type of problem was 
still regarded as better than the type of problem that really 
occurs in life, which is usually comparatively simple. This 
attitude is still quite common. The author recently heard 
a teacher of many years’ experience defend the use of 
puzzle problems on the ground that life problems are too 
easy. 
Effect on Methods. Another result of the disciplinary 
end in our schools was to place greater emphasis upon 
analysis and explanation than upon ability to do. As 
much stress was laid on the ability to explain carrying 
in addition and borrowing in subtraction as upon a
-P-A-G-E-14
8 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
mechanical mastery of these processes; the ability to give 
long, formal analyses of puzzle problems was considered 
to be as important as the ability to solve life problems. 
The effects of the scientific and disciplinary ends are 
still felt today in the organization of our work and still 
more in our methods of teaching. The author recently 
visited a fourth grade in one of our large cities, and found 
the pupils analyzing examples in long division. The pupils 
were slow arid inaccurate in carrying out the process but 
they could give beautiful analyses—all alike.

Origin. It has been shown how the scientific end origi- 
nated with the Greeks and. was handed down to us by the 
monastic schools of the middle ages, and how the doctrine 
of formal discipline was later brought to its defense. 
Although the influence of these ends has been very marked 
and has persisted to the present time, another end or point 
of view has existed parallel to these for several centuries 
and at the present time is gradually superceding them. 
This point of view had its beginnings, as far as Europe 
is concerned, at the time of the Rennaissance. The Ren- 
naissance in arithmetic was brought about by the gradual 
introduction of the Hindu notation, knowledge of which 
came to Europe from the Arabs of Spain and northern 
Africa. This gave the people of Europe a practical system 
of notation and of calculation and enabled them to develop 
the practical side of arithmetic. The Greeks had already 
done something along this line but were handicapped by 
the lack of a usable system of notation. The people of 
Europe, particularly the Italians, now took what little 
they had received from the Greeks of a practical nature, 
combined it with the arithmetic of the Hindus and with 
this as a basis, developed the practical side of the subject 
as we know it today.
-P-A-G-E-15
ENDS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED 9 
Our early American arithmetics drew their subject mat- 
ter from both these sources and as a result were a mixture 
of the science of numbers inherited from the Greeks and 
Romans, and the art of calculation and its practical appli- 
cations inherited from the Hindus and Europeans. Thus 
we find in these books both the Greek proportion and the 
Hindu rule of three, which was simply proportion in a 
different guise and under a different name. We also find 
both duodecimal fractions, which originated among the 
Romans, and decimal fractions which probably originated 
in Germany during the sixteenth century. 
Definition. The doctrine of formal discipline or mental 
training, set up by educators as a defense for all the useless 
material included in our early American arithmetics, satis- 
fied the people for a while, but gradually the protests of 
the business man and the practical man in all lines of work 
became too strong to be met with this doctrine. Educators 
today have come to realize that it fis the business of the 
schools not to teach the science of arithmetic as such to the 
pupils, but rather through the teaching of arithmetic to 
prepare the pupils for life! This change has been hastened 
by the overthrow of the doctrine of formal discipline on 
psychological grounds. This new aim of preparation for 
life may be called the Social Aim. It is so important that 
it will be discussed in detail in the next chapter.

  CHAPTER II 
THE SOCIAL ENDS IN ARITHMETIC 
It is very well to say that today the dim in teaching 
arithmetic is to prepare the pupils for life, develop socially 
efficient individuals) ete.;, but to stop with such general 
statements is to havé nothing but high-sounding, meaning- 
less words. } Such a statement of ends is too general, too 
indefinite to be of much assistance as a guide in teaching. 
To be of the greatest service, the formulation of ends must 
state in definite terms what can and must be done in 
teaching arithmetic in order to prepare the pupils for 
life. 
I; To Equre tHe Pupins wiTH THE IpEAs, Facts AND 
Processes NEEDED IN Everypay Lirs 
There are certain arithmetical ideas, facts and processes 
that are of such frequent occurrence in so many different 
walks of life that everyone should have a knowledge of 
them as part of his general, elementary education. 
Many studies have been made to determine the exact 
nature and extent of the knowledge needed. These studies 
have shown that the arithmetical equipment used by the 
average individual in life is not nearly as extensive or 
complex as we formerly supposed, but they have also 
shown that a certain informational, and computational 
knowledge of the subject is absolutely essential. ( ‘We may, 
therefore, state the first of the social aims, or objectives, 
of arithmetical instruction in the elementary school, as 
follows: 
_/ To equip the pupils with a knowledge of those arith: 
méetical ideas, facts and processes that are frequently used 
in the everyday life of the average individual@ j

-P-A-G-E-17
  
SOCIAL ENDS IN ARITHMETIC , i 
II. To Prove an Automatic CONTROL OF THE 
FUNDAMENTALS: 
Sometimes a mere informational knowledge of a subject 
is all that is needed, but in the case of the fundamental 
facts and processes of arithmetic this is not sufficient. 
Merely to be able to add is not enough; to meet the de- 
mands of modern life one must be able to add accurately 
and with a reasonable degree of speed. In order to do 
this one must be able to handle all of the facts and steps 
involved in the process instantly and without having to 
take the time to reason them out logically. / In short, to 
meet the needs of life an automatic control of the funda- 
mental facts and processes is necessary. These fundamer- 
tal facts and processes are: 
(a) The four processes of addition, subtraction, multi- 
plication and division of integers, common fractions, mixed 
numbers, decimals, and compound numbers of not more 
than two or three denominations. 
(b) Common units of measure and their relations. 
(Tables of denominate numbers.) 
(c) The fundamentals of percentage. There are seven 
of these: changing per cents to common and decimal frac- 
tions; changing common and decimal fractions to per 
cents; finding per cents of numbers;"finding what per cent 
one number is of another; and finding a number when 
any per cent of it is known. 
(d) The rules of simple mensuration. 
(e) Ratio and proportion. Pupils should have a knowl- 
edge of the meaning of these terms and enough practice 
to enable them to find the ratio of any two numbers, and 
to form and solve a proportion. 
(f) The use of simple mathematical formulas and tables. 
The above constitute the ‘‘tools’’ of arithmetic. All else 
is but application of one or more of these. Without a
-P-A-G-E-18
  
12 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
thorough mastery of the tools, no successful work in arith- 
metic is possible. Therefore the second objective of arith- 
metical instruction as a preparation for life is: 
“Lo give the pupils an automatic control of the funda- 
mental facts and processes, so they can handle them with 
a high degree of accuracy and a fair degree of speedS~ 
III~TLo DeveLop THE Power To APPLY THE FUNDAMENTALS 
To ConcrETE SITUATIONS 
A mere mastery of the tools of arithmetic, however, is 
not sufficient. One must know when and under what 
circumstances to use these tools. It is not enough that our 
pupils know how to add and divide, they must also know 
when to use these operations; in other words, they must 
be able to ‘‘size up’’ an arithmetical situation and select 
the tools necessary to meet the situation successfully. 
Further, it is not sufficient that pupils be able to use their 
arithmetical tools in meeting arithmetical situations in a 
book—they must be able to use them in meeting situations 
outside of books. So the third objective is: 
To develop in the pupils the ability to understand and 
interpret simple arithmetical situations such as commonly 
occur in life, and the power to apply successfully the 
ideas, facts and processes of arithmetic to their solution. 
IV. To Devetor tHE Asmity To THINK AND THE Hasir 
or THINKING 
If the pupils are to be adequately prepared for life, the 
schools must giye them something more than the mere 
mastery of the subjects taught. They must prepare them 
to meet new and unforeseen situations; knowledge and 
habit, alone, will not enable the pupils to do this. Knowl- 
edge is necessary but not ik itself sufficient. New situa- 
tions can be successfully met only by exercise of the higher 
powers of thinking and reasoning. Can the schools do 
‘
-P-A-G-E-19
SOCIAL ENDS IN ARITHMETIC 13 
anything to develop these powers? Undoubtedly, yes. 
They can and they do. Pupils get more or less ‘‘mental 
discipline’’ from every subject studied. Arithmetic is no 
exception, in fact it affords unusual opportunities for such 
discipline, better than afforded by any other elementary 
school subject except history and geography. 
Admitting the possibility of mental training is an en- 
tirely different thing, however, fiom justifying the teach- 
ing of any subject on disciplinary grounds alone. Since 
this discipline can be obtained from any subject, properly 
taught, disciplinary value is not in itself enough to justify 
the inclusion of any subject or topic in the curriculum. If 
disciplinary value exists, whether it be great or small, it 
is a by-product to be gained more through the method of 
teaching than through the particular subject taught. 
Arithmetic is justified in the elementary school curriculum 
solely because of the practical Tale of Tis Bab ject matter) 
This does not mean, however, that we should not do all 
in our power so to utilize this practical material as to 
develop the child in every possible way. 
(The disciplinary value of arithmetic is largely the train- 
ing in logical thinking fhat can be given by the subject if 
properly taught.) Therefore, if the schools are to do all 
possible through arithmetic to prepare for life, we must 
set up as our fourth objective: e 
<To so teach as to give the pupils the opportunity to 
develop their inborn power to think, fo form the habit of 
thinking things out for themselves a to form a just 
estimate of the social worth of piste 
Errects or THE Soctan Enps 
Effect on Topics. We have inherited much material 
concerning numbers from the Greeks and Hindus. But to 
realize the social aims of arithmetic, we must select only 
that which will help us accomplish our ends.  
-P-A-G-E-20
  14 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
To accomplish the social ends we do not need to teach 
anything except those topics that will help prepare the 
pupils for successful and useful participation in life. The 
sole test of what to teach must be—Is this fact or process 
one that the pupils may be called upon to use in life, 
one that may help some of them to succeed ? 
Eliminations. If we set up such a standard as the 
above, it will mean that many topics now in our arith- 
metics must be eliminated. The following are examples: 
1. Greatest common divisor. 
2. Least common multiple as a separate topic. 
8. Fractions with large denominators. The common 
fractions taught should be those actually used in business 
and in practical life. 
4. Obsolete tables and units in denominate numbers and 
those used only’ by specialists, as, Troy and Apothecaries’ 
Weight, Surveyors’ Measure, long ton, hand, rood, furlong, 
etc. 
. 5. All work with compound numbers of more than two 
or three denominations. 
6. All problems in Longitude and Time. 
7. Compound Proportion. 
8. The long process of extracting cube root. Even 
square root is doubtful. It would be better to substitute 
tables of square and cube root and teach the pupils how 
to use them._ 
9. Complex Fractions. 
10. All applications of percentage that do not conform 
with present day business practice. Among these are: true 
discount, partnership, partial payments, equation of pay- 
ments, foreign exchange and annual interest. 
Additions. It has been seen that some topics in the older 
arithmetics are being eliminated because they are not 
socially important. At the same time, the course is being
-P-A-G-E-21
  
SOCIAL ENDS IN ARITHMETIC 15 
enriched by the addition of other topics that are socially 
important and that were not in the older books. Among 
the most important of these are the following: 
1. Algebra. At one time it was the custom in many of 
our schools to give a short course in algebra in the seventh 
or eighth grade. This work was usually of the most 
formal, uninteresting and useless kind, and as a result 
prejudiced many people against algebra below the high 
school. At present an entirely different sort of algebra is 
being taught in many of our schools. It is not presented 
as a separate subject but grows naturally out of the work 
in arithmetic, particularly in mensuration and percentage. 
Literal notation, the equation and the formula are taught 
as tools to be used in the solution of arithmetical situations. 
2. Geometry. In addition to the usual work in simple 
mensuration, many schools at the present time give some 
time to simple surveying (based on the right triangle, and 
on similar triangles), and to the applications of some of 
the more important facts of geometry to practical situa- 
tions such as carpentry and shop work.! The geometric facts 
used are not proved but are discovered by experiment. 
3. Mathematical tables such as square root, cube root, 
simple and compound interest tables._ 
4. Statistical Graphs. The use of graphs to present sta- 
tistical data is so common in newspapers, magazines and 
books that it is the duty of the schools to teach their pupils 
how to make and interpret such graphs. | In many schools 
the pupils are given practice in constructing graphs show- 
ing the variations in the temperature of the school room 
for one school day, the absences for one month, their 
scholarship records in the various subjects, ete. Practice 
is also given in interpreting graphs in current newspapers 
and magazines. 
5A more careful and detailed study is being made in

  Ge TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
the upper grades of the social situations underlying the 
more important and fundamental business applications of 
arithmetic, such as Banking, Taxation, Insurance, Methods 
of Investing Money, ete. 
Effect on Problems. The accomplishment of the social 
ends demands life rather than puzzle problems. If we 
are to prepare our pupils to solve the arithmetical situa- 
tions that they will meet in life, we must give them life 
problems in school. So we find our newer arithmetics 
giving problems that actually occur in business, farming, 
cooking, sewing, carpentry, shop work, manufacturing, 
building a house, furnishing a home, ete. (The traditional 
text book problem is disappearing and Ne problems are 
taking their place.) 
Effect on Organization. Under the influence of the social 
aim, the center of attention is shifted from the subject 
itself to the learner.’ The modern school is no longer 
content with teaching the subject to the child but rather 
is attempting to teach the child through the subject. » This 
changed point of view has led to a radical change in the 
organization of the subject matter. (The subject itself has 
given place to the learner as the basis of the organization. 
The material, instead of being grouped under the large 
subdivisions of arithmetic is presented in the order that 
seems to be best adapted to the abilities and interests of 
the pupils. Those topics or co of topics that are most 
needed at the time, and whiclare within the grasp of the 
child, are given first, and as the needs and abilities of the 
children develop other topics and parts of topics are added. 
Such an organization is called psychological, and it differs 
radically from the old logical order. \ Instead of completing 
each topic before going on to the next, the easiest parts 
of each and those most needed at the. time are taken up 
first and the more difficult phases are postponed until 
later. ) This leads to a spiral arrangement in which each
-P-A-G-E-23
  SOCIAL ENDS IN ARITHMETIC 17 
topic recurs several times in the course, but with some- 
thing new added each time. As an example, under the old 
logical organization, the four operations with integers were 
completed before taking up the work in common fractions. 
The pupils, however, need to know something about such 
simple fractions as 14, % and % before they need to know 
anything about carrying in addition and borrowing in 
subtraction.¥\So, under a psychological organization, the 
work with fractions is started long before the work with 
integers is completed and recurs at intervals throughout 
the course—the work already done being reviewed and 
more added at each recurrence. ) 
Effect on Methods. Under the influence of the scientific 
and disciplinary aims, it has been seen that much emphasis 
was placed on explanations and analyses of processes and 
of problems. ‘Under the social aim it does not matter 
whether the pupils can explain a process or not, providing 
they can perform it with accuracy and speed.) Social 
efficiency does not demand the ability to explain “bor- 
rowing” in subtraction or the process of long division, but 
it does demand a mechanical mastery of these processes. 
This should not be taken to mean, however, that these 
processes should not be justified to the pupils when first 
presented. \)In the case of problems, the social emphasis 
is on the ability to solve rather than on the ability to 
give long formal analyses or explanations. ‘Whatever 
analysis of problems is done in the schools should be solely 
for the purpose of helping the pupils to solve other prob- 
lems. ) " _ } 
Many other changes of method have come from the 
shifting of the center of attention from the subject to the 
child. These will be treated in detail throughout the book. 
Among the most important of these changes are the 
changed attitude toward objective work, the use of games, 
stories, and dramatization, the change in the character of
-P-A-G-E-24
  18 ‘ TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
the drill,!the attempt to motivate the work, the utilization 
of the pupil’s own interests and activities, the setting of 
concrete standards, and the measuring of results. 
Present Status 
It would be a mistake to suppose that all these changes, 
due to change of aim, have already occurred and are finally 
accomplished. ) This is not the case, the present is a time 
of transition. Although in theory, educators have aban- 
doned the scientific and disciplinary aims, in practice they 
still dominate much of our work. Many of the text books 
now in use were written under the influence of these aims, 
and even the best of our books show their influence to 
some extent.¥ At the present time, however, American arith- 
metics are making rapid strides towards complete socializa- 
tion. The author recently asked a teacher of many years’ 
experience to examine a set of arithmetics just published. 
She returned them with the comment, “Why, these are not 
arithmetics, they are books on sociology.” , 
The case is not so hopeful with teachers and methods 
as it is with text books. Many of the methods of teaching, 
in common use in our schools today, go back to the old 
ends and are poorly adapted to the work of socializing 
the pupils. ‘The greatest obstacle in the way of bettering 
the teaching of arithmetic is the teacher. )Too often she 
is entirely lacking in knowledge of or sympathy with the 
social point of view. Her sole object is to “teach the book.” 
Teachers and supervisors must be thoroughly imbued with 
the social point of view before better teaching of arith- 
metic is an accomplished fact in our schools.

  CHAPTER ITI 
THE COURSE OF STUDY 
SHovutp ArirHMEtic Be TaueuT IN THE First Year? 
Present Practices. Formerly in this country the formal 
study of arithmetic was started in the first grade. More 
recently the tendency has been to postpone the formal 
teaching of the subject until the second, or in some eases, 
even the third school year. y Where this is done, sometimes ~ 
no arithmetic at all is taught in the first grade; but usually 
the subject is taught incidentally in connection with the 
other work of the grade. 
There are, then, three different practices among our 
schools. Some still give a formal treatment of the subject 
in the first year and attempt, through formal drill, to 
memorize and habituate some of the combinations or facts 
in the fundamental processes, such as a part of the addi- 
tion combinations. Other schools give no formal drill 
and make no attempt to memorize and mechanize any of 
the fundamental facts, but take advantage of the oppor- 
tunities that arise in connection with the work and play 
ofthe pupils, both in and out of school, in order to develop 
number ideas and to acquaint the pupils with number 
names and symbols. Still other schools entirely eliminate 
the work in number in the first year. 
The question naturally arises as to which of these plans 
is best. Although we have as yet very little experimental 
evidence bearing directly on this question, we can, neve 
theless, in the light of modern psychology, give a rather 
definite answer. ; 
Formal Arithmetic vs. No Arithmetic. In an experi- 
ment conducted in a public school in New York City in 
1913.* The entering pupils were divided into two equal

20 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
groups as nearly alike in all respects as possible. During 
the first year one group did no work in arithmetic except 
counting, the time thus saved being devoted to reading. 
The other group was given formal work in arithmetic. 
At the middle and end of the second year both groups were 
tested by the use of standard tests, with the following 
results: 
2B Tests: Oral Written 
Group taking formal arithmetic in first year 87.2 | 69.5 
Group without arithmetic in first year..... 90.7 61.0 
2A Tests: 
Group taking formal arithmetic in first year 81.0 12.6 
Group without arithmetic in first year..... 87.1 89.4 
That is, at the middle of the second year, the group that 
had no arithmetic in the first year did somewhat better in 
the oral work in arithmetic, but not quite so well in the 
written work. By the end of the second year the group 
without arithmetic in the first year excelled in both the 
oral and the written work in that subject. 
The results of this experiment, while not conclusive, 
would seem to indicate that no arithmetic in the first year 
is better than a formal drill course.’ The teachings of 
modern psychology also lead us to the same conclusion. 
No Arithmetic vs. Incidental Arithmetic. The experi- 
ment discussed in the previous section indicates that for- 
mal arithmetic has no place in the first year, but throws 
no light on the question as to which of the two remaining 
practices is the better. In fact, we have no experimental 
data bearing on this question. \ The best we can do, there- 
fore, is to examine some of the arguments on both sides. 
In determining when any given topic or subject is to 
be taught, three questions should be considered. (1) Do 
the pupils need this topic or subject at this time? (2) 
\
-P-A-G-E-27
  
THE COURSE OF STUDY 21 
Are they capable of mastering and using it? (3) Is it 
naturally interesting to them? Let us examine these three 
questions in detail with respect to arithmetic in the first 
year. 
Is Arithmetic Needed? It would be entirely possible for 
pupils to get along without any study of arithmetic in 
school during the first year. But, while the need is not 
pressing, it nevertheless exists. The pupils make as much 
use of their number work as of their reading or anything 
else that they study in this year. Their games involve 
counting in choosing sides and in keeping score: they are 
constantly encountering number ideas and facts in their 
other school subjects and in their simple purchases and 
other activities outside of school. That this need exists 
is shown by the fact that almost all pupils have some 
knowledge of numbers before entering school and it is 
the duty of the school to satisfy and expand this need as 
rapidly as possible. 
Is Arithmetic too Difficult? The belief that arithmetic 
is too difficult for the average first grade pupil originated 
at a time when the subject matter of arithmetic was com- 
plex and entirely unconnected with the needs and activities 
of the child, and the methods of teaching were abstract 
and formal. Such a treatment of the subject was un- 
doubtedly too difficult and if it were the only kind pos- 
sible, schools would be justified in postponing arithmetic 
until at least the third grade. But with material care- 
fully chosen according to the needs, comprehension, and 
interests of primary children, and with concrete, interest- 
ing methods of instruction, the situation is entirely dif- 
ferent. 
The statement is sometimes made that arithmetic calls 
for a type of logical reasoning of which the children in 
this year are incapable. All the evidence available indi- 
eates that first grade pupils can think and reason logically,
-P-A-G-E-28
  
  22 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
providing always that the situations in which they are 
asked to reason are suited to their degree of maturity and 
come within the range of their experience. What first 
grade teacher and what parent has not been frequently 
astounded by the power of children of this age to reason 
and draw logical conclusions?, Their conclusions are not 
always correct, as the premises on which they are based 
are often wrong or incomplete, owing ,to the limited 
experience and knowledge of the children, but the logic is 
nevertheless usually thoroughly sound. 
Beyond question, the average beginner in school is ma- 
ture enough for any informal work in arithmetic that a 
modern course of study would assign to the first grade. 
The experience of schools giving a modern treatment of 
the subject in this grade substantiates this statement. 
Is Arithmetic Interesting? The belief that arithmetic is 
uninteresting to the child in the first school year is, again, 
due to the wrong kind of arithmetic. / With material and 
methods suited to the children, the subject becomes one 
of the most interesting in the curriculum.) All children 
naturally like to count, the rhythm makes an instinctive 
appeal; and with a proper use of objective work, construc- 
tion work, games and the other activities of the pupil, the 
whole subject is far removed from the dudgery that it 
often was in the past, and becomes a real pleasure. ; 
Are Arithmetic and Reading too Much? The argument 
that the pupils should not be required to start the study 
of two such difficult subjects as reading and arithmetic 
at the same time, is probably one of the strongest offered 
against starting the number work in the first year. The 
experience of many schools, however, would seem to indi- 
cate that the average class is capable of beginning both 
subjects at the same time, and that if the first school year 
is devoted to reading alone it is apt to become rather
-P-A-G-E-29
  
THE COURSE OF STUDY 23 
monotonous and uninteresting. If both can not be well 
done, however, the arithmetic should be postponed, as there 
can be no dispute as to the relative importance of the two 
at this time. With an exceptionally weak class or in 
communities where the pupils come from the homes of 
foreigners, the difficulties of mastering the mechanics of 
reading may be sufficient to justify postponing the number 
work to the second year. 
Six Years Needed for Arithmetic. If it is possible to 
start the arithmetic. in the first-year it should be done for 
several reasons. In the first place, many pupils drop out 
of school at the end of the sixth year owing to the fact that 
in most states they are not compelled to attend school 
after reaching fourteen years of age. For this reason 
not only the fundamentals of arithmetic but its most im- 
portant applications as well should be completed as early 
as possible, by the end of the sixth year at the latest: 
This is also desirable because of the present growing ten- , 
dency to make the break between the elementary and the ¢ 7 5 
high school at the end of the sixth instead of the eighth i 
school year as formerly. ; i 
In order to be meaningful and useful the facts and 
processes of arithmetic must first be met with in a con>—— 
erete setting. By far the most important objective of the 
beginning work in number, whether given in the first or 
second year, is to help the pupils to obtain clear number 
ideas and number images by giving them plenty of experi- 
ence with concrete situations involving these ideas, 
To postpone this objective work in arithmetic to the 
second year leaves insufficient time for the more formal 
work. The curriculum becomes so crowded that there is 
not enough time to separate difficulties sufficiently. The 
result, is that before the pupils master one difficulty they 
must take up another and soon become hopelessly involved. 
Furthermore, in order to assure the retention and mechan-
-P-A-G-E-30
24 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
ization of the number facts and processes, it is essential 
that the pupil’s experience with them be as prolonged as 
possible. One may memorize a poem in an hour, but most 
people will soon forget it. If, however, the poem is re- 
learned several times over an interval of months or years, 
it will eventually be fixed permanently in mind. In order 
to insure a permanent mastery of the fundamental facts 
and processes, the drill on them must be spread over as 
long a period of time as possible. This makes it desirable 
that the informal, concrete work in arithmetic be included 
in the first year so that the more formal work can start 
in the second. Even then the pupils who withdraw from 
school at or before the end of the sixth year have not, in 
many cases, had a long enough experience in the subject to 
insure permanent retention. The drill work should be 
continued in the junior high school, or the seventh, eighth, 
and ninth years, for the benefit of those pupils who remain 
in school. ; 
Conclusions. In spite of the scarcity of experimental 
data there seems to be little doubt that the best plan is 
to teach some number work incidentally and informally 
in the first grade. This conclusion is also in line with the 
practice of most of the better schools.fhe number work 
should be made to grow naturally out of the work and 
play of the child in school, on the playground, and at 
home% This does not mean, however, that there should 
be no definite allotment of work to the first year. Ex- 
perience everywhere has shown that incidental number 
work means no number work, unless the teacher is held 
responsible for accomplishing a certain definite amount of 
work. Because of the difficulty that most teachers have 
in getting definite results from incidental number work, 
in the outline that follows, the work of the first year is 
given in much greater detail than that of the remaining 
years.

Number as a Sequence. The pupils should become 
familiar with the number names and their sequence from 
1 to 10 by 1’s, and from 10 to 100 by 10’s and then by 1’s. 
Activities. This can be accomplished through the use 
of activities such as the following: 
1. Rote or rythmie counting for its own sake and in 
connection with rhythmic games, dances, ete. 
2. Rhymes such as: 
One, two, buckle my shoe; 
Three, four, shut the door; 
Five, six, pick up sticks; 
Seven, eight, lay them straight; 
Nine, ten, a big fat hen. 
Many such rhymes can be dramatized or acted out 
rhythmically with or without music. 
Number as a Measure of Quantity. By the end of the 
year the pupils should have a clear ‘idea of each of the 
numbers from 1 to 10 as answers to the question ‘‘How 
many?’’ These ideas are developed by the counting of 
objects, or rational counting. 
Activities. Counting the number of children in a row, 
number of crayons needed to supply the row, number of 
times ball is bounced or rope skipped, number of petals 
on a flower, number of lines down from top of page (in 
locating a certain line), number of words from beginning 
of line (in locating a certain word), number on a side in 
a game, ete. Lv 
Numbers in Their Relations to Other Numbers. The 
pupils should know ‘‘What number is one more than 
five?’’, ‘‘Two more than seven?’’, ‘‘One less than eight?’’, 
ete. This knowledge is obtained through counting and
-P-A-G-E-32
  26 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
through comparisons. Through this work the pupils should 
become familiar with the words more, most, less, and 
least, and the corresponding ideas. 
Activities. 1. Rote counting by ones and by twos. 
2. Rational counting by twos as counting by two, hands, 
feet, eyes, ears, the number of children as they march 
past in pairs, the number of pieces of paper needed to 
supply a row if each pupil needs two, ete. 
3. Comparisons. ‘‘How many pennies (real or toy 
money) does Harry have?’’, ‘‘How many does Mary 
have?’’ ‘‘Which has the most?’’, ‘‘How many more?’’ 
Similar comparisons can be made of the number of 
marbles, the number of eggs gathered, the number of times 
a ball is bounced, a rope skipped, ete. 
Reading Numbers. As the pupils become acquainted 
with the number names they should be given the corres- 
ponding symbols. In this year they should learn to read 
numbers written in the Hindu-Arabic symbols from 1 to 
100. In words from 1 to 10. Roman numerals to XII. 
Activities. 1. Finding page in primer. 
2. Games, matching word, symbol and number group, as

4. Telling time. 
Writing Numbers. In Hindu-Arabie symbols to 100 
and in words to 10. 
Activities. 1. Keeping attendance records, ete. 
2. Recording scores in games. 
8. Keeping store records in the play store, etc. 
The Concept of Magnitude, or Size. The idea of ‘‘mag-
-P-A-G-E-33
THE COURSE OF STUDY 27 
nitude’’, ‘‘size’’, or ‘‘bigness’’, is gained through the mak- 
ing of indefinite comparisons. The pupils should become 
familiar with the following words and the ideas for which 
they stand; taller, tallest, shorter, shortest, larger, largest, 
smaller, smallest, higher, highest, longer, longest, heavier, 
heaviest, wider and widest. 
Activities. Comparison of heights, weights, sizes, etc., 
as, ‘‘Which is taller, Alice or Mary?’’ 
The Concept of Measurement. The work in indefinite 
comparisons leads naturally to questions such as ‘‘How 
big?’’, ‘‘How tall is Alice?’’, ete. This leads to the proc- 
ess of measuring. The first measurements made should 
be with non-standardized units such as the length of the 
foot, the pace, the length of the arm, cupfuls, ete. From 
this work the pupils get the concept that to measure any 
magnitude means to compare it to another magnitude of 
the same kind used as a unit. As this work progresses the 
need for standardized units arises naturally. The pupils 
in this grade should become familiar with the following 
standard units; inch, foot, yard, cent, nickel, dime, pint, 
quart, hour, day, week, and month. They should also 
become familiar with the simple relationships between 
these units, such as 1 quart — 2 pints, ete. 
Activities. 1. Measurement of the school room, heights 
of pupils, desks, amount of water in bucket, goods sold 
in play store, materials used in construction work, ete. 
2. Estimates verified by measurement. ‘‘How long is 
this line?’’, ‘‘Measure it and see if you are right.’’, ‘“How 
much water do you think there is in the pail?’’, ‘‘Measure 
it.’’, ete. ‘‘Without using your ruler, draw a line a foot 
long.’’, ‘‘ Another three feet long.’’, ‘‘Measure them.’’, ete. 
Addition. The meaning of addition is developed ob- 
jectively through such situations as the following: A 
pupil buys two articles at the play store, one marked 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
28 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
three cents, the other five cents. To find the cost of both 
the pupil counts out three cents of real or toy money to 
pay for the first article and five cents to pay for the second. 
He then puts them together and finds how many cents it 
will take to pay for both by counting the total. He is 
told that this process of ‘‘putting together’’ or ‘‘com- 
bining’’ numbers is called addition. The terms addition, 
and add are used. No attempt is made to memorize the 
results. 
Activities. Buying and selling at the play store, scores 
in games, number of eggs collected at noon and at night 
and both times together, ete. 
Subtraction. The work in subtraction grows naturally 
out of the work in counting and making comparisons. 
From this work the pupils should know ‘‘ What number is 
one more than five?’’, ‘‘Two more than seven?’’, ‘‘One 
less than eight?’’, etc. "The work in comparisons should 
include comparisons of the number of objects in two 
groups, such as, ‘‘How many marbles has John?’’, ‘How 
many has Harry?’’, ‘‘Which has the most?’’, ‘‘How many 
more?’’ The answer to this last question can be found 
objectively. If John has seven marbles and Harry five, 
the pupil can count out one group of seven and another 
of five. He can then take five (which equals the number 
in the second group) from the first group and by counting 
find that there are two left. He thus finds that seven is 
two more than five. He is then told that this process of 
taking a smaller number from a larger, or of finding how 
much larger one number is than another, is called sub- 
traction. 
Activities. 1. Comparison of possessions such as marbles, 
and pennies, comparison of scores~in games, ages, prices 
of articles in the play store, number of times a ball is 
bounced or a rope skipped, etc. 
2. Making change in play store.

Geometrical Concepts. The pupils should become 
familiar with the concepts rectangle (oblong) circle and 
sphere -(ball). 
Activities. Discussion of shapes of materials used in 
construction work, of desk, pictures, money, circle formed 
by pupils, balls used in games, ete. 
Method and Aims. All of the work of this grade, 
except the rote counting, should be objective, and all, 
except the writing of numbers, should be oral. The pur- 
pose of the work is to help the pupils become familiar with 
simple arithmetical concepts, symbols and words. 
Grade 2. 
Rote Counting. To 1000 first by 100’s and then by 
10’s. Counting by 1’s from any even hundred to the next 
even hundred not greater than 1000. Counting by 2’s to 
100 starting with 0 and with 1. Counting by 3’s to 100 
starting with 0, 1 and 2. Counting by 4’s and 5’s in the 
same way. This work gives drill on addition combinations 
and addition by endings and prepares for multiplication. 
Counting in the reverse order gives drill on subtraction 
combinations. 
Reading and Writing Numbers. 1. In Hindu-Arabic 
symbols to 1000. 
2. In words to 10. Also by tens to 100, as ten, twenty, 
thirty’. <].-one hundred. 
3. In Roman symbols to XII. 
Place Value. As preparation for addition and subtrac- 
tion of two place numbers and for carrying and borrow- 
ing, the pupils, through the grouping of sticks, become 
thoroughly familiar with the fact that a number such as 
27 consists of a certain number of tens and a certain num- 
ber of ones. The names and meanings of the first two 
places are learned. The pupils should be able to represent
-P-A-G-E-36
  30 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
any two-place number with the sticks and also to tell 
what number is represented by a given combination of 
sticks. 
Addition. 1. Continued emphasis upon the meaning of 
addition. Enough of the facts should be developed ob- 
jectively to make sure the meaning is clear. 
2. The 100 addition facts or combinations. As a prep- 
aration for subtraction each is drilled on in four ways: 
5 5 4 4

The combinations are also drilled upon in the horizontal 
form as5 + 4 = 9. :

6. Check by adding in the reverse order. 
Subtraction: 1. Continued emphasis on the meaning of 
subtraction. Enough of the facts should be developed 
objectively to insure a clear grasp of the meaning. Ques- 
tions such as the following should be asked frequently: - 
“Five from eight leaves how many?’’, ‘‘Hight is how 
many more than five.’’, ‘‘How many must be added to 
five to make eight?’’
-P-A-G-E-37

are developed and drilled upon at the same time as the cor- 
responding addition facts as:

The horizontal form 9 — 4 = 5 is also used.

5. Check by addition. 
Multiplication: The concepts ‘‘two times’’, ‘‘three 
times’’, ete., are developed and used in the comparison of 
two magnitudes and two groups. Thus the pupils know 
that 4 is composed of two 2’s, 6 is composed of two 3’s 
or three 2’s, ete. They know that 6 is three times as many 
as 2 and that the firstlige given below is three times as 
long as the second. 4%

They also meet situations such as the following: ‘‘ What 
will you have to pay for three apples if one apple costs 
5e?’’ By working this out objectively they see that it will

are told that this is written 3X5 or 8 and read ‘‘three 
fives’’ or ‘‘three times five’’ in either case. They are also 
told that this process of finding the total number of objects 
if
-P-A-G-E-38
  32 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
in a number of equal groups is called multiplication. 
Enough of the facts or combinations are developed objec- 
tively to make this meaning clear. 
2. Facts through the table of 5’s, or, if preferred, all 
whose product is less than 25. As a preparation for the 
work in division and fractions each fact is drilled upon 
in four ways, as: ‘‘2 X 3 = ?’’, ‘‘How many 8’s in 6?’’, 
“*3 is what part of 6?’’, and ‘‘14 of 6 = ?” 
Fractions. 1. The concepts %, 1%, %4 and ¥% are 
developed and used. Both the ‘‘part’’ and the ‘‘com- 
parison’’ ideas are developed. The part idea is based on 
the equal sharing of possessions with others. The compari- 
son idea comes from the work in comparisons, as ‘‘John 
has twice as many apples as Harry’’, ‘‘Harry has half as 
many as John’’. (See page 94.) 
2. Through objective development and the work in mul- 
tiplication the pupils learn 4, 1%, 4 and ¥% of the num- 
bers within the range of the multiplication facts learned, 
in the cases where the results are integers. 
Division. 1. Division is first taught as the process of 
finding how many times one number is contained in 
another. This idea of division is developed objectively 
and from the corresponding multiplication facts. 
. 2. The division facts are developed and memorized 
within the limits of the multiplication facts learned. 
Each fact is drilled upon in two forms, 2)6 and 6+2. 
Measurement. 1. The concept of measurement is re- 
viewed and emphasized throughout the year. 
2. The following new uhits are used; pound, gallon, 
quarter, half-dollar, dollar, dozen, minute, and year. 
Geometric Concepts. The pupils continue the use of 
the concepts introduced in the first year and become 
familiar with the square, cube and triangle.

Applications. The arithmetic of this year grows out 
of and is applied to the various activities of the school, 
playground, and home, and to simple one-step problems 
based on these activities. Many problems are made by 
the pupils (a) to fit given abstract statements, and (b) to 
be solved by a given process.

they can do so by dividing the number by 38, etc. From 
this time on the two uses of division are emphasized, i. e., 
“To find how many times one number is contained in 
another,’’ (this is the pupil’s fundamental idea of division) 
and ‘‘To find a part of a number.’’

the facts a pupil must know in division are included in the 
following table:

Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Years 
The mathematical curriculum of the seventh, eighth and 
ninth school years is at present undergoing a complete 
reorganization in connection with the junior high school 
movement. For that reason no attempt will be made here 
to outline the work by years. 
In order to understand the character of the work in 
mathematics that is being proposed for these years it is 
necessary to know something of the nature and purposes 
of the junior high school itself. In the first place the
-P-A-G-E-49
  
THE COURSE OF STUDY 43 
junior high school completes the school education of the 
majority of boys and girls, as only a comparatively small 
percentage continue into the senior high school. (One of 
the most important functions of the junior high school, 
therefore, is to complete the task of equipping the pupils 
with the knowledge, habits, attitudes and appreciations 
which possess sufficiently high practical value to a large 
enough number of individuals to make it advisable that 
they be included in the general education of everyone: 
To accomplish this end the mathematics of these years 
must be something more than, and different from, the 
traditional arithmetic of the seventh and eighth years and 
formal] algebra of the ninth. Some of the arithmetic and 
alg taught in these years can hardly be justified 
on ds of ‘‘high practical value to a large number 
of i als’? and should, therefore, be eliminated. On 
the ogper hand some portions of geometry and trigonometry 
do possess sufficient practical value to make it advisable 
that they be included in the education of everyone. 
(A second important function of the junior high school 
is to give the pupils a sufficiently wide and varied 
knowledge and appreciation of the different lines of human 
activity and learning to enable them to ‘‘find themselves’’. / 
The mathematics of the senior high school is usually 
entirely elective. This makes it necessary to give the 
pupils of the junior high school at least a slight foretaste 
of algebra, geometry and trigonometry in order that they 
may have some intelligent basis for deciding whether or 
not they want to elect these subjects in the senior high 
school. 
So, both because of their high practical value and as a 
basis for determining the election or non-election of further 
mathematics in the senior high school, the curriculum of 
the junior high school must include arithmetic and some 
portions of algebra, geometry and trigonometry.
-P-A-G-E-50
  Aa TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Arithmetic. The arithmetic of these years should con- 
sist largely of two types of work, first a further drill upon 
the fundamentals, and second, a more extensive and in- 
tensive study of the important applications of the subject. 
Among the applications studied should be the following: 
1. The arithmetic of the home, including such topics 
as family budgets, household accounts, dealing with a 
bank, interest, and economy of purchase. 
2. The arithmetic of savings and investment, in- 
cluding savings banks, compound interest, treasury 
savings certificates, real estate, mortgages, stocks, 
bonds, life and fire insurance. 
3. The arithmetic of civic life, including state, 
and income taxes. 
4. The arithmetic of business, includi 
goods, trade and cash discounts, figuring é 
determining the selling price and profit, metho 
collecting money, and bank discount. 
All of these topics should be studied from the informa- 
tional and social rather than the mathematical point of 
view.    
    
  Geometry. Applied geometry considers three questions 
concerning the objects studied; namely Form, Position, 
and Size. All three of these phases of applied geometry 
should be included in the curriculum of the junior high 
school. 
1. The geometry of form should include such topics 
as simple geometric drawing involving the elementary 
constructions, a consideration of the use of geometric 
forms and designs in industry and art, similarity of 
shape, and the making of scale drawings. 
2. The geometry of position should include a study 
of the various methods of locating points and the 
making of plans and maps.

8. The geometry of size should include Jinan at measurement of lines and angles, the finding of areas, 
volumes and surfaces of the simple geometric figures, 
and the indirect measurement of heights, distances and 
angles by means of scale drawings and similar tri- 
angles. ) ¥ 
Algebra. The work in algebra should include the teach- 
ing of the algebraic language, or the use of letters to of xy 
represent numbers or quantities and mathematical symbols 1g 
to express relationships between them, the formula, the _~.———_- 
equation, positive and negative numbers, and the use of Bk 
all these in the solution of problems. It should also include 
as much of the technique of algebra such as addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, factoring, ete., as is 
necessary in connection with the above. Considerable time 
should also be devoted to the construction and interpreta- 
tion of bar, circular, and line or algebraic graphs. 
Trigonometry. In many schools enough trigonometry is 
included in these years to enable the pupils to solve right 
triangles. This work comes up in connection with prac- 
tical measurements of heights and distances. 
Organization. Several arrangements of the material out- 
lined above are being tried out in our schools today. The 
National Committee on Mathematical Requirements in its 
report* suggests five plans. (See Appendix page 332.)

  CHAPTER IV 
TYPES OF TEACHING IN ARITHMETIC 
No book can solve for the teacher all of the problems 
that will arise in the teaching of arithmetic. The best it 
can hope to do is to help the teacher solve her own prob- 
lems. Good teaching can never come from the mechanical 
and slavish following’ of any set method. The teacher 
must always be an intelligent, thinking being, who, trained 
in the technique of her profession, and guided by a work- 
ing, functioning knowledge of general principles, thought- 
fully and intelligently, meets each difficulty as it arises. 
Definition of Method. Most teachers and many books 
on methods have too narrow a conception of the meaning 
of method. A method is simply a means to an end. With 
the end in view, the method is the tool used to realize this 
end. There is no one best method of teaching any part of 
the subject of arithmetic. The value of methods is purely 
relative and, as previously stated, can be measured only 
in terms of the particular ends to be accomplished. The 
method that is best for one class or one teacher is not 
necessarily best for another class or teacher. For any 
given teacher, that method is best which, for that par- 
ticular teacher, with her particular class and with all the 
special conditions surrounding that class, will most nearly 
accomplish the end that should be accomplished by the 
teaching of that particular piece of subject matter. 
Purpose of This Book. This book, therefore, will make 
no attempt to consider in detail the best method of teaching 
this, that, and the other topic, throughout the whole sub- 
ject. Its purpose is rather to describe the different kinds, 
or types, of work to be done in the teaching of arithmetic, 
46 
lea 6%}
-P-A-G-E-53
  TYPES OF TEACHING 47 
to give an understanding of the underlying psychology, 
and to aid the teacher in gaining a mastery of the tech- 
nique of each of these types. 
Several excellent books have been written on the types 
of teaching that arise in teaching in general. It is the 
purpose of this book to apply the general discussion of 
such’books to the particular subject of arithmetic. 
Types of Teaching. In general, the teacher of arithmetic 
has three things to do. (1) Present new knowledge. 
(2) Fix in mind and make habitual and automatic knowl- 
edge already presented, and (3) develop in the pupils the 
ability to apply this knowledge to concrete, life situations. 
It must not be supposed that these types of teaching neces- 
sarily occur separately, and that they are mutually ex- 
clusive—that in one recitation the teacher is always con- 
cerned with one type only and in another recitation with 
another type. All of these types may occur in a single 
recitation, but it will simplify the discussion and also make 
it easier for the teacher to understand each type if we first 
consider them separately. 
- PRESENTATION OF NEw KNOWLEDGE 
Kinds of Knowledge to be Presented. The new material 
to be presented in arithmetic is of several kinds. It may 
be a new general idea or concept such as, the notion of 
what is meant by “7,” “4,” “square,” or “addition.” It 
may be a new fact such as, “2+38=5,” “3X7=21,” or 
“C==7d.” It may be a principle, that is, a truth of a more 
fundamental and basic kind such as, “Multiplying both 
the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same 
number does not change its value,” or “The product of 
two or more factors is the same no matter in what order 
the multiplications are performed.” It may be a process 
such as column addition, long division or square root. 
Finally it may be a rule, such as “To divide by a fraction, 
<< \ Ni
-P-A-G-E-54
    
48 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
invert the divisor and multiply,” or “To multiply decimals 
multiply as with whole numbers and point off in the 
product as many decimal places as in the multiplier and 
multiplicand together.” 
Fixing AND MECHANIZING 
In arithmetic every recitation does not add to the pupils’ 
knowledge. The purpose of many recitations is not to 
teach something new but to fix in mind and mechanize 
knowledge that the pupils already have in their possession. 
This type of work is usually called drill work, or drill. 
DEVELOPING THE ABILITY TO APPLY 
It is not enough that the pupils know how to add, sub- 
tract, multiply and divide; they must also naw when to 
use these processes and facts. The purpose of much of 
the work in arithmetic is to develop in the pupils the 
ability to apply their knowledge of arithmetic to concrete 
situations. 
Problems and Examples. The conerete situation or 
its description is brought into the school gpom as a 
problem. The term problem will. used? in this “book 
in the above sense, namely, to mean‘ conerete life situation 
having a numerical side. For the abstract drill situation 
389 
such as, 47)3978 or 756 the term example will be used.

Possible Methods. In presenting new material to pupils 
four methods are possible™“The teacher may (a) give arbi- 
trarily BP. = werner or explanation, (b) give and 
then explain—that is, by a line of logical reasoning attempt 
to convince the pupils of the correctness of the fact, rule, 
or process already presented, (c) give and then have the 
pupils verify the truth of the fact or the correctness of 
the result obtained by the rule or process, or (d) lead 
the pupils to discover the new for themselves. 
These four methods may be illustrated by the presen- 
tation of the rule for multiplying an integer by 10, namely, 
“To multiply an integer by 10, annex a cipher to the 
right.” According to the first method, the teacher tells 
the pupils, arbitrarily, how to multiply an integer by 10 
and proceeds at once to drill them on the process. 
In using the second method the teacher first presents 
the rule arbitrarily, as before, but then tries to convince 
the pupils of the correctness of the rule by explaining it 
in terms of place value, namely, “In the system of writing 
numbers which we use, the value of each place, as we go 
from right to left, is ten times that of the preceding place, 
thus, the first place is units, the next tens, the next hun- 
dreds, ete. So annexing a cipher at the right pushes each 
digit one place to the left, that is into a place, the value

50 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
of which is ten times as great as the value of the place 
the digit originally occupied. Therefore the value repre- 
sented by each digit and the whole number is multiplied 
by 10.” Such a method of presentation attempts not only 
to convince the pupil of the correctness of the rule but 
also tries to make clear why the rule is correct. 
The third method aims only at convincing the pupils 
that the rule is correct by having them verify the answer 
obtained by using the rule; it does not attempt to show 
why the rule gives the correct result. The teacher presents 
the rule arbitrarily as before and then requires the pupils 
to verify the result, in this case probably by addition. 
Using the rule the pupils get 10 23—230, then by adding 
ten 23’s verify the correctness of the result and of the rule. 
» The fourth method is radically different from the other 
three. In using it the rule comes last instead of first and 
is stated by the pupils instead of by the book or by the 
teacher. From their knowledge of the multiplication facts, 
the pupils already know that 10X7=70, 10x3=320, 
10x9=90, etc. If their attention is called to these facts 
they can easily be led to compare and generalize for 
themselves, concluding that if they want to multiply any 
number by 10, all they need to do is to annex a cipher. 
Then they can verify the results obtained by using their 
rule as in the preceding method. This is the method of 
inductive development or the method by which the pupils 
are led to discover general truths by examining and com- 
paring special cases. Or, the new knowledge may be 
obtained by using general knowledge that the pupils 
already have in their possession. This is the method of 
deductive development. Inductive and deductive develop-_ 
ment are alike in that they both start with a problem 
or difficulty; they differ only in the means taken to meet 
this difficulty. In both, the new rule, principle, process 
or fact comes last as a result of the thinking and not first.
-P-A-G-E-57
  PRESENTING NEW MATERIAL Bt 
These methods of discovery will be treated in detail in 
the succeeding chapters. 
The “Give” Method. This method has two decided ad- 
vantages—it is the quickest and easiest way of presenting 
new material. The chief objections to the use of this 
method are, (1) telling does not insure understanding 
and (2) it tends to form in the pupils the habit of 
depending on others for their knowledge rather than the 
habit of thinking things out for themselves) There can 
be no question as to which habit is the more useful in 
life and consequently which the schools should encourage. 
Probably the greatest defects of much teaching in the past 
have arisen from regarding teaching as a giving process 
and learning as a receiving process. Modern education 
is no longer a process in which the teacher pours infor- 
mation into the pupils but rather one in which the pupils 
learn and grow by discovery and by doing things for 
themselves. 
(The “give” method is utterly opposed to the spirit of 
modern education and should seldom be used. It is the 
resort of the lazy or poorly trained teacher who knows 
no other way, i 
The “Give/and Explain” Method. This method is the 
result of the old scientific and disciplinary teaching of 
arithmetic. There are several objections to its use. (Pupils 
in the elementary school, particularly in the lower grades, 
are very much interested in knowing what_is true but 
not usually in why it is true. Further, a logical explana- 
tion is often beyond their comprehension. Such explana; 
tions should be given only when demanded by the pupil 
After the pupils are convinced that annexing a cipher 
multiplies by ten, if they raise any question as to why 
it does so, the teacher should explain, otherwise no explana- 
tion should be attempted. This method also makes the 
pupils passive participators in the learning process as
-P-A-G-E-58
52 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
the explanation must usually come from the book or 
teacher and at best all the pupils do, is to follow. Usually 
they do not do even this, for if they are already convinced 
of the correctness of the rule, they do not see the need 
of any explanation and therefore are not interested. If 
they are not convinced, the explanation will not usually 
convince them. The too frequent use of this method is 
the mistake often made by the young teacher just out of 
college who attempts to use in the elementary school meth- 
ods suitable for the university. 
The ‘‘Give and Verify’’ Method. The third method is 
open to the objection that after they have been given the 
fact, rule, or process by the book or teacher, most pupils 
are perfectly willing to accept it, and do not see the need 
for any verification. If, however, the new fact is discov- 
ered by the pupils, the need of verification immediately 
arises and the pupils are very much interested in testing 
the correctness of their own conclusion. 
The Method of Discovery. This method has many ad- 
vantages over the other three. In the first place, it secures 
thinking on the part of the pupils, because it presents 
the proper situation to cause thinking—that is, a problem 
situation. None of the other methods do this as they all 
start by giving the information. In this method, the pupils 
are confronted with a problem. In the illustration used 
before, the problem is to discover an easy way to mul- 
tiply by ten. \n order to solve this problem, the pupils 
must review what they already know about multiplying 
by ten, compare, draw their conclusion and verify. This 
method has the further advantage thath it encourages the 
‘pupils to use what they already know to meet new situa- 
tions, it trains them to acquire knowledge for themselves, 
to verify their first conclusions, and not to depend entirely 
on their teacher and text-boo Hinally it is more inter- 
esting, simply because of the~greater activity it demands  
-P-A-G-E-59
  PRESENTING NEW MATERIAL 53 
of the pupils and because of the natural pleasure of dis- 
covery and of doing things. 
Conclusions. Whenever possible, pupils should be led 
to discover new knowledge for themselves and should then 
be required to verify their discovery. Then if any explana- 
tion of why things are as they are is demanded, it should 
be given by the teacher for the benefit of those pupils who 
see the need for and are interested in it. If for any 
reason such as lack of time or too great difficulty, the 
pupils can not discover new information and must get it 
from the teacher or book, they should be asked to verify 
so they will not form the pernicious habit of believing 
everything they read or hear.
-P-A-G-E-60
  -* CHAPTER II 
THE INDUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 
The process by which the mind discovers new general 
truths by studying and comparing individual objects or 
eases is called induction. It is the method usually used 
in discovering new knowledge in arithmetic. The discov- 
ery of the rule for multiplying by 10 from the multipli- 
cation facts, 10<3=30, 10X9=90, ete., given in the pre- 
ceding chapter, is an example. New ideas, facts, principles 
and processes may be discovered in the same way. For 
example, by counting, the pupils find that 4 apples and 
5 apples are 9 apples and that 4 boys and 5 boys are 9 
boys and so on, and come to the conclusion that 4 and 5 
are always 9. Or, by measuring the circumference and 
diameter of a circular object and comparing, the pupils 
find that the circumference is a little more than three 
times the diameter. If it is then suggested to them that 
they measure other circles of different sizes, they will find 
that the same relation still holds and finally come to the. 
general conclusion that no matter what the size of the 
circle the circumference is always a little more than three 
times the diameter. 
It must be remembered that induction is a means of 
discovering apparent truth and not a means of proof or 
explanation. The fact that a certain thing is true ninety- 
nine times is no proof that it will be true the hundredth 
time. To get a rigorous, logical proof or explanation, 
another type of thinking must be employed. But, as 
has already been pointed out, the pupils in the lower 
grades do not feel the necessity for, nor are they inter- 
ested in logical proofs and explanations. They are in the 
stage of mental exploration and discovery.

INDUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 55 
The Steps in the Inductive Development Lesson. In 
arriving at a general conclusion by conscious induc- 
tion, the mind goes through certain steps or phases of 
thinking which are roughly as follows: (1) The realiza- 
tion and definition of the problem, (2) The selection of 
individual cases coming under the general problem, (3) 
The study and comparison of the individual cases, picking 
out the essential elements or those bearing on the problem 
to be solved, and eliminating the non-essential, (4) The 
forming of an hypothesis or tentative generalization and 
the verification of this hypothesis, (5) The final acceptance 
and formulation of the generalization, (6) The applica- 
tion of the generalization to be sure everything is thor- 
oughly understood. The phases of the inductive lesson 
corresponding to these phases of inductive thinking will 
be spoken of hereafter, for convenience, as, (1) The Prob- 
lem, (2) Selection of Cases, (3) Comparison and Abstrac- 
tion, (4) Hypothesis and Verification, (5) Final Gen- 
eralization, (6) Application. 
Tue ProBLEM 
The purpose of this phase of the recitation is twofold, 
(a) to show the pupils that their present store of knowl- 
edge is insufficient to enable them to meet successfully 
some new situation or situations and to cdnvince them 
of the importance and necessity of being able to master 
such situations, and (b) to make clear to them just what 
new knowledge they will need in order to do so. Thesé 
might be called Motivation and Definition of the Problem. 
Motivation. To motivate the presentation of new 
knowledge means to convince the pupils that they need 
new knowledge in order to accomplish some end in which 
they are interested, to show them that their further 
advancement in the subject depends upon acquiring the 
new information.
-P-A-G-E-62
  
56 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
The teacher has the power to give the pupils the infor- 
mation whether they want it or not but she hasn’t the 
power to make them take it. One is reminded in this con- 
nection of the old saying, “You can lead a horse to water 
but you can’t make him drink.” Pupils will be much 
more interested in acquiring new information and it will 
mean much more to them if they feel a need for the new 
knowledge. A little time spent in establishing a need or 
providing a motive will later be saved many times. 
The psychological time to present any new topic is when 
the pupils feel a need for it and, with a properly organized 
course of study and text, a skilful teacher can usually 
make the need arise naturally out of the work the pupils 
are doing. When this can be done better results are 
obtained in less time. 
The ultimate motive for all of the work in arithmetic 
must be sought in its practical applications which are 
brought into the school-room in the form of interesting 
and real, life problems. If the pupils can be interested 
in some practical application of arithmetic, in some prob- 
lem, and find that they can not solve this problem because 
they do not know how to multiply decimals, the need of 
gaining this new knowledge is brought strongly home to 
them. 
As an illustration, take the following development of 
the rule for multiplying a fraction by a whole number, 
which came under the observation of the author recently. 
A group of girls in their work in cooking had encountered 
the following situation. A recipe called for % eup of 
flour and made enough for three people. Their problem 
was to enlarge the recipe so as to make enough for six 
people. The cooking instructor had referred the difficulty 
to their regular teacher. The girls realized that their 
stock of arithmetical knowledge was insufficient and were 
very anxious to add to it so they could meet this situation.
-P-A-G-E-63
  INDUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 57 
Although the problem motive is the best and most uni- 
versal, there are others that can also be used effectively. 
In the lower grades, particularly, the game motive is 
often very effective. The pupils can be interested in some 
game, the playing of which involves something that they 
do not know, and in order to play the game they are 
interested in acquiring the new knowledge. 
A short review can often be used to show pupils that 
they need to know something new. The teacher can ask 
the pupils to make a summary of the arithmetical knowl- 
edge that they possess along some particular line and 
have them examine it to see if there is anything lacking. 
As an illustration, suppose a class is ready for the new 
process of dividing a decimal by a decimal. The teacher 
might motivate the new work by having the pupils sum- 
marize what they already know about division of decimals, 
namely, (a) how to divide a decimal by an integer, and 
(b) how to divide a decimal by powers of ten. If the 
teacher then asks the pupils what they do not yet know 
in division of decimals, the need of the new knowledge, i. e., 
how to divide a decimal by a decimal, will be clearly seen. 
It has just been seen how work can be motivated by 
review or by looking back. It can also often be motivated 
by looking ahead to what is coming. As an illustration, 
suppose pupils have just started the work in addition of 
fractions with unlike denominations. The first cases met 
are simple ones such as, 4%+% and 4+%. In these simple 
eases the pupils depend on memory to tell them what the 
common denominator will be. Thus they know in 4%+% 
that the common denominator is 4. But later they are 
going to meet cases like #%+-%2, in which they will not know 
the common denominators. By looking ahead and con- 
sidering such cases with the pupils the need for a method 
of finding the common denominator becomes evident. 
The pupils can also be shown the need of an easier
-P-A-G-E-64
  58 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
way of doing something. For example, they may know 
how to multiply 224% 3% as common fractions and they 
can be shown that the process is a laborious one and told 
that it is often easier to write mixed number as decimals 
and then multiply. This could be made the motive for 
finding out how to multiply decimals. 
Finally, new work may sometimes be motivated by mak- 
ing an appeal to the pupils’ pride. The desire to be able 
to work with larger numbers or to make larger scores in 
the games is often sufficient motive. Suppose third grade 
pupils have been playing the bean bag game* and instead 
of taking the number hit as their score have been multiply- 
ing the number hit by 3. The desire to make larger scores 
in this game would then be sufficient motive for learning 
the multiplication table of 4’s.° In a rural school or in a 
room in which two grades or two sections of the same 
grade are seated, pupils in the lower grade or section 
often want to learn something new simply because they 
have seen the older pupils using it. The author once knew 
a third grade pupil who demanded that his teacher teach 
him long division. He had become interested in it through 
watching the fourth grade pupils in the same room. 
Definition. In the situation described above the girls 
felt the need of increasing their arithmetical knowledge 
in order to solve the problems that arose in their cooking 
class. Thus the motive was provided for the arithmetic 
teacher. She still had to make sure, however, that the 
girls knew exactly what the difficulty was, namely, that 
they could not solve the problem because they did not 
know how to multiply a fraction by a whole number. 
Teachers often make the mistake of trying to lead the 
pupils to discover something when the pupils have only a 
vague idea of what it is they are to discover. Before 
_ *See page 180.
-P-A-G-E-65
INDUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 59 
trying to find a method of overcoming the difficulty, the 
teacher must be sure that the pupils know exactly the 
nature of the difficulty to be overcome. The problem must 
always be definitely stated, preferably by the pupils. 
SELECTION OF CASES 
Simplicity. Having defined the difficulty and aroused 
the pupils’ interest in overcoming it, the next step is the 
selection of individual cases from which the pupils are 
to discover their solution of this difficulty. Thus in devel- 
oping the rule for multiplying a fraction by an integer 
the cases 2% and 3*%o might be used. The individual 
eases should be carefully chosen. In the first place, they 
should be just as simple as possible. In developing the 
rule mentioned above, to use cases such as 8X% would 
simply serve to increase the difficulty and distract the 
pupils’ attention. In presenting the rule for multiplying 
decimals, .2.3 will bring out the essential points better 
than 3.7537.9, for it is easy to see at a glance that 6 
is the product of 2 and 3, but it is not so easy to see that 
142125 is the product of 375 and 379. 
Variety. In the second place, the cases used must have 
sufficient variety to bring out clearly the essential points 
and to make the conclusion correct and general. If in 
developing the rule for multiplying a fraction by a whole 
number, the cases 2X% and 3% are used, the pupils 
might draw the incorrect conclusion that the numerator 
of the answer is always the same as the multiplier. 
Typical. Further the cases used must be such that the 
essentials stand out prominently. If, in developing the 
rule for multiplying a fraction by a fraction, the case 
%<% were used, the pupils might think it through and 
get the result % which is certainly correct, but does not 
bring out the essential relations sought, namely, that in 
multiplying fractions the numerator of the result is the
-P-A-G-E-66
60 ‘TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
product of the numerators, and the denominator of the 
result the product of the denominators. 
Number of Cases. No arbitrary statement can be made 
as to the number of individual cases that should be used 
in this step. Enough must be used to bring out the essen- 
tials sought; more than that is a waste of time. Sometimes 
a single case is sufficient but if a tentative generalization 
is drawn from a single case, the verification becomes 
doubly important and several cases should be used in that 
step. 
COMPARISON AND ABSTRACTION 
In this step the pupils must be led by the teacher to 
see the essentials in each of the individual cases presented 
and, by comparison, to pick out the relations that are 
common to all. Teachers sometimes perform this step for 
the pupils, thus largely destroying the value of the 
whole lesson. The pupils can abstract the essentials for 
themselves if they have a skillful guide. If, in develop- 
‘ng the rule for multiplying a fraction by an integer, 
having used the two cases, 2<#%—=-+%—% and 3x%o—= 
Ho+%o+%o—%o, the teacher should ask a general ques- 
tion such as “What do you see that is alike in both these 
cases?” the pupils would not see anything. But by pro- 
posing the definite problems, “Let us see if we can find 
a short way of getting the answer without having to add,” 
“Who sees how we could get the numerator of the answer 
in each problem?” “How could we get the denominator ?” 
and “Who can tell me how to multiply a fraction?” the 
pupils will have no difficulty in picking out the essential 
relations for themselves and forming their own rule. 
The comparison and abstraction may often be aided by 
the elimination of non-essentials and by the arrangement 
of the work. Thus instead of comparing the two cases 
mentioned above as they were first worked out, namely, 
   
-P-A-G-E-67
INDUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 61 
2x %=—%+%—% and 3X %o—o+%o-+Ho=Mo, the teacher 
might eliminate the intermediate step by which the answers 
were obtained and rewrite the problems and answers only 
(2x%=% and 3x%o0-—=%0) placing one under the other 
to facilitate the comparison. 
HYPOTHESIS AND VERIFICATION 
The first generalization made by the pupils should not 
be final, but tentative, rather in the nature of an hypothesis 
than a fixed, final conclusion. It seems to be human nature 
to generalize from too few data and the schools should 
do all in their power to counteract this tendency instead 
of encouraging it as they sometimes do. It is impossible 
in the schools to have pupils examine hundreds of different 
cases before drawing any conclusion, but the teacher can 
prevent their forming the habit of jumping to a fixed, 
final, general conclusion as soon as they see that a certain 
relationship exists in one or two cases. When they see, 
for example, that if they take the fraction % and multiply 
both terms by 2, the resulting fraction % has the same 
value as the original fraction %, they should not be led 
or permitted to come to a final conclusion as none is justified 
as yet. They should simply be led to think “Why, that 
is odd. I wonder if that is always true?” and should then 
proceed to find out by examining other cases. If they 
find that the same relationship holds in several other cases, 
they are then justified in forming the conclusion that 
“Multiplying both the numerator and denominator of a 
fraction by the same number does not change the value 
of the fraction.” If any doubt remains the teacher and 
the book can assure the pupils that the relation that they 
have discovered is universally true. The habit of inductive 
thinking, to be formed in school and used in life should 
not be (a) Notice relationship in one or two instances, 
(b) Conclude that this relationship always exists, but
-P-A-G-E-68
  62 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
(a) Notice relationship in one or two instances, (b) Won- 
der if the same relationship always holds, (c) Proceed to 
verify the supposed discovery and (d) Draw conclusion. 
In life this conclusion should not even then be final but 
subject to change in case instances are met that do not 
conform. 
Methods of Verifying. Two methods of verification are 
useful in arithmetic, (a) by examining more cases, and 
(b) by checking in some way the results obtained by using 
the tentative conclusion. Suppose pupils have taken the 
fraction %4 and multiplied both terms by 2 and, by repre- 
senting both graphically, found that the resulting fraction 
% is the same as the original fraction 4% and have formed 
7a as 
Se) 
the hypothesis that, “Multiplying both the numerator and 
denominator by the same number does not change the value 
of the fraction.” Then they could verify this hypothesis 
by taking the fraction %, multiplying both terms by 3, 
getting %, and representing both fractions graphically. 
haters 
Wg eee 
Other similar cases might also be taken. 
Or, having, from the facts 10X7=70, 10X5—50, 
10X3=30, drawn the tentative conclusion “To multiply 
-a number by 10 annex a cipher” the pupils could verify
-P-A-G-E-69
  
INDUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 63 
this conclusion by applying it to 1017 and checking the 
result obtained by addition.

Finau GENERALIZATION 
Made by Pupils. In this step, the general fact, prin- 
ciple, rule or process discovered from the individual cases 
studied and compared in the previous steps, is formulated 
and stated in clear, concise form. The generalization 
should be made by the pupils, not by the teacher. The 
pupils’ first statements will be crude and incomplete, but 
by comparing and criticizing the statements of one another, 
they can, with some help from the teacher, formulate their 
conclusion in simple, brief form. 
The author recently observed a recitation in which the 
class discovered the rule for multiplying by ten. After 
taking several cases, the teacher asked, “Who can tell us 
the shortest and easiest way to multiply by 10?” The 
first statement of the rule given by a pupil was, “The 
easiest and shortest way to multiply by 10 is to add a 
nought.” Another statement was, “To multiply any num- 
ber by 10 you just put a nought after it.” The pupils then 
decided that the “you” was unnecessary and finally stated 
the rule in the form, “To multiply any number by 10 add 
a nought.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
    
64 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
In Words and Symbols. In many cases the generaliza- 
tion'should be made not only in words but also in mathe- 
matical symbols. Thus, by counting, the pupils find that 
three boys and four boys make seven boys, three apples 
and four apples make seven apples, and draw the con- 
clusion that three and four are seven, expressing the con- 
clusion in words and then in symbols 3+4=7. Similarly, 
by measuring, the pupils discover that the circumference 
of a circle is a little more than three times the diameter 
and state the conclusion in words and symbols, as C=7d. 
APPLICATION 
To Problems—Purpose. The step of application has a 
double purpose. Having acquired new information, the 
test of whether the pupils really understand and appre- 
ciate its full significance is their ability to use it. In 
arithmetic it is not sufficient to possess certain knowledge 
but one must know how to use this knowledge as a tool 
in solving concrete, arithmetical situations. Thus, appli- 
eation is the final step in acquiring new information. It 
is not enough for the pupils to know that 3-+-4=7 or that. 
C=7d; they must also know when to use these facts. The 
new fact or other information must be connected from the 
beginning with the kind of concrete situations in which it 
is used. Therefore it is not sufficient to use abstract drill 
examples in the step in application. In order that the 
pupils may understand the importance and meaning of 
the new information and know in what kinds of situations 
to use it, application must be made to concrete, applied 
problems. 
To Examples—Purpose. Besides being the final step in 
the acquisition of new knowledge, the application is also 
the first step in making this information a permanent 
possession of the mind. The pupils, having discovered 
how to multiply decimals would forget before the next
-P-A-G-E-71
INDUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 65 
day if they did not at once proceed to use the rule, at 
least a few times. The application to applied problems 
helps fix the information in mind but usually this is 
not sufficient and, therefore, abstract drill examples must 
also be used for this purpose. 
In the step of application, the pupil is applying the 
general knowledge, that he has just discovered, to partic- 
ular cases—that is, the thinking involved is deductive. 
In spite of this, however, this step is an integral and 
necessary part of the inductive development lesson and 
should not be separated from the other steps. Since the 
last step of the inductive lesson is really deductive, such 
a lesson is often called inductive-deductive. 
Supervision. The first applications made by the pupils 
must be made in class and closely supervised by the teacher 
so that she can correct any mistaken ideas the pupils may 
have before they become fixed in mind. 
To assign seat or home work for the pupils at the close 
of the step of verification and before the pupils have had 
a chance to use the newly acquired knowledge under the 
supervision of the teacher is to invite trouble. The teacher 
should be sure that every individual pupil can not only 
state the generalization but also use it before it is safe 
to ask the class to use it for themselves. 
Tue Steps ArE Not SEPARATE 
It should not be thought that the steps discussed above 
are absolutely separate and distinct. “Their arrangement 
in a definite order is more or less formal, useful for the 
purpose of description. They overlap and inter-penetrate 
one another in the actual thinking process. ... While the 
idea of inductive method as a series of steps, each one 
complete in itself before the next is entered upon, breaks 
down; it still remains true that there are certain char- 
acteristic phases or movements of thought, in the inductive
-P-A-G-E-72
    
66 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
process each one of which is necessary in some degree of 
its fulfillment to the next.”* 
Time REQUIRED 
Teachers often feel that they have not time for inductive 
teaching but must resort to telling. This attitude usually 
arises from the fact that the subject matter is more. im- 
portant in the teacher’s mind than the effect the method 
of presentation will have on the pupils. This is largely 
the result of the old scientific attitude. Inductive work is 
so important that the teacher must find time for it even 
if she finds it necessary to sacrifice such topics as cube root, 
and Longitude and Time. As a matter of fact, the induc- 
tive presentation of new material does not take nearly 
as much time as many teachers think. Often the first five 
steps can be covered in a few minutes and the rest of 
the recitation spent on application. Sometimes, however, 
such a recitation will require more time. The problem 
may arise and be defined one day and the other steps 
taken the next. Often this is the better way. In the 
work of today, the pupils encounter a new difficulty and 
become interested in overcoming it, but if they have not 
sufficient time they can postpone the solution of the prob- 
lem until the next day. Sometimes it may even be neces- 
sary to postpone the final step of application until a third 
recitation ; whenever possible, however, at least a little time 
should be given to the application in the same recitation 
that the discovery of the new knowledge is first made. 
Thus the time taken for the inductive presentation of 
new knowledge varies from just a few minutes to two or 
three recitations, but in any case the time is well spent as 
the pupils get at least as much real benefit from mastering 
the technique of discovering new knowledge for themselves 
as they do from the particular fact or rule discovered.

  CHAPTER III 
THE INDUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 
—OBJECTIVE WORK 
Much of the inductive work of the grades is also objec- 
tive, that is, the individual cases from which the pupils 
get the new general knowledge are concrete, objective 
situations. Thus the pupils get the fact 3x4—12 by tak- 
ing 3 groups of 4 objects each, using various kinds of 
objects, until they discover that 3 fours always make 12; 
they find that the circumference of a circle is always a 
little more than 3 times the diameter by measuring circular 
objects; and they learn that multiplying the denominator 
of a fraction divides the value of the fraction, by taking 
some fraction as %, multiplying the denominator by 2 and 
picturing both the original and resulting fraction graph- 
ically or objectively as:

Purpose oF OBJECTIVE WorK 
To Develop Ideas. The use of objective situations is 
particularly important in the acquisition of new ideas and 
facts. The teacher can not give the pupils the idea “one- 
half,” for example, by telling them what it means. The 
only way the pupils can really get the idea is through their . 
own experience by taking objects and groups of objects 
and dividing them into two equal parts and then being 
given the name of these equal parts.

-P-A-G-E-74
68 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
To Develop Facts. It is also impossible to convey a new 
kind of fact abstractly so that it will really mean anything 
to the pupils. The teacher can tell the pupils that 2 and 3 
make 5 but unless they actually work out this or similar 
facts objectively, it will mean nothing to them. “The story 
is told of the little boy who came home from school one 
afternoon and was asked by his mother what he had 
learned that day. He replied that he had learned a poem 
about the Tootums Family. When his mother asked him 
to repeat it he did so as follows: 
Tootums one is two, 
: Tootums two is four, 
Tootums three is six, 
Tootums four is eight. 
He had been learning multiplication facts but had ne 
idea of their meaning and regarded them simply as a poem. 
This story may or may not be true, but it illustrates a 
situation that often oceurs—pupils memorizing a set of 
abstract facts that have absolutely no meaning to them 
because they have never been met objectively. 
It is essential that ideas and facts that are entirely new 
be first met in objective situations in order that the abstract 
words and symbols stand for real ideas and eall forth the 
proper imagery in the pupils’ minds. This is the purpose 
of all objective work in arithmetic. 
WHEN To Use OsgEcts 
The tendency in the past, where objects have been used, 
has been to use them extensively in the lower grades and 
not at all in the intermediate and upper, on the supposition 
that the older pupils do not need such objective treatment 
but can grasp the idea or fact abstractly. Such an assump- 
tion is false. The mature mind is no better able to get an 
entirely new idea abstractly than is the immature mind. 
Objective presentation is just as essential in the mee
-P-A-G-E-75
  OBJECTIVE WORK 69 
as in the primary grades. The only reason objects are used 
more extensively in the primary grades is that the pupils 
at that stage are acquiring more new ideas and facts, than 
at any other time. 
Wuen to Stop Usine Opszcts 
It is just as essential to know when to stop using objec- 
tive situations as it is to know when to use them. The 
pupils must eventually know that 2+3—5 and that 
3X5=15 without having to use objects or even think in 
terms of objects. It is not necessary to present all the 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, fraction and division 
facts concretely; indeed it would be a waste of time and 
would defeat the desired ends, as the pupils might form 
the habit of thinking objectively and be unable to handle 
the abstract number facts. It is, however, essential that 
the first addition, sup¥yaction, multiplication, fraction and 
division facts be in concrete setting in order that - 
these types of facts may have meaning to the pupils. 
The objective situations should be used only until the 
pupils have grasped the meaning of these facts. It is just 
as bad to keep the pupils in the objective stage of develop- 
ment too long as it is to neglect it entirely. 
CHARACTERISTICS OF Goop @ssEctIVE MaTERTAL 
Variety. The material used should be carefully chosen. 
There are several requisites for good material. In the 
first place, it must be varied. If the pupils work out all 
the number facts with sticks, there is danger that they 
will associate them with sticks only and be unable to apply 
them to situations involving other objects. The author 
recently observed a recitation in which the teacher was 
trying to develop the idea of a square. The pupils were 
shown several squares made of cardbeard and of different 
sizes and colors. ‘They found that the figures had four
-P-A-G-E-76
  70 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
sides and four corners and by measuring found that the 
four sides of each figure were equal. The teacher then 
gave the name square and asked the pupils to find all 
the square objects in the room. They readily picked out a 
square blotter on the teacher’s desk and a square picture 
mounted on a square piece of cardboard, but failed to 
recognize the square window panes, the squares on a large 
calendar on the wall or the squares in the iron ventilating 
register. They had the idea square associated with card- 
board and could not apply it to other things. 
Further, in seeking variety, the teacher should not con- 
fine herself to three dimensional objects. Pictures, repeti- 
tion of acts, dramatization, games, measuring, marks, num- 
ber pictures, diagrams and models are objective situa- 
tions as well as sticks, pencils, cubes, books and desks. The 
pupils can get the idea of 7 from clapping their hands 
seven times or measuring a line that is seven feet long 
just as well as from counting seven three dimensional 
objects. Indeed, they will get a much better and broader 
idea if they do all three things. 
Reality. Besides being as varied as possible, the objec- 
tive material used must be real to the pupils. It is much 
better, particularly in the beginning, to use books, pencils, 
desks, the pupils themselves, hair-ribbons, buttons on 
dresses, toy money and standard units of measure than 
sticks, cubes, beans and lentils. The real objects are more’ 
interesting and possess the additional advantage that the 
pupils acquire the ideas and facts from the kind of mate- 
rial to which they are going to apply them and not from 
highly artificial and abstract material. 
Unity. Although a variety of material must be used in 
presenting any new idea or fact, it is better, when possible, 
to have all the material used in a given recitation con- 
nected and unified in some way. For example, in a given 
recitation toy money, scales and weights, yard sticks, boxes
-P-A-G-E-77
OBJECTIVE WORK 7a 
of crackers, and other merchandise might all be used and 
still all be grouped around the central situation of Playing 
Store. The material might also be unified by being used 
in the dramatization of some story, problem or picture; 
in constructing something in Industrial Arts; or in playing 
some game. Such unification of material is desirable, as 
it makes the work both more interesting and more real. 
Tue Kinps or Opsective Siruations THat SHoutp BE 
UsED 
The following kinds of objective material have been sug- 
gested in this chapter: 
1. Three dimensional objects that are real and interest- 
ing to the pupils, such as toy money, the merchandise in 
the play-store; the standard units of measure, the pupils 
themselves, bean bags and other objects used in their games, 
and the common objects of the school-room such as books, 
pencils, erasers, desks, ete. 
2. Pictures in the reading primers and other books, pic- 
tures on the wall and picture cards or charts illustrating 
the primary number facts. These can be bought or made 
by cutting out pictures and pasting them on cardboard. 
For example, to illustrate the number fact 3+5=8, the 
picture of eight apples could be cut from a fruit catalog 
and pasted on a card in two groups of three and five, 
respectively. 
3. Repetition of simple acts such as clapping hands, 
taking steps and knocking on the door. 
In addition there are several types of material that might 
be called semi-objective : 
1. Conventional, artificial objects, such as cubes, sticks, 
beans, ete. These possess one decided advantage, namely, 
convenience. It is possible to have an unlimited supply 
of them always on hand; they are easy to handle and 
economical of time. In the beginning, these objects can
-P-A-G-E-78
ERE TREE RP SOE UNE TENET Ts eR, 2 Po ICRL MLO TTI 
72 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
be made more real and interesting by imagining that 
they represent real things. Thus in dramatizing the prob- 
lem—“If Johnny had three apples in his lunch basket this 
morning and ate one at recess, how many has he left?’— 
the pupils could use sticks and imagine they were apples. 
This make believe appeals to the instinctive tendency of 
the child to pretend and imagine, and often makes the 
situation just as real and interesting as if the real objects 
(in this case apples) were used. Later, to save time, these 
objects can be used simply as objects without thinking that 
they represent anything in particular. ; 
2. Number Pictures and Marks. Even the conventional 
objects are not always at hand when needed but the teacher 
and pupils can always picture the number situation, objec- 
tively, by means of marks or number pictures. Thus if 
the teacher in the third grade in the course of a recitation 
has reason to believe that one of the pupils does not know 
what 383X412 means, she would need to objectify the 
situation to make its meaning clear. She might not have 
any objects convenient but could have the pupil represent 
it by marks on the blackboard as, 
sooo, oo Of JI TM IM 
_ 8. Diagrams and Models such as the well known fraction 
diagrams as, 
Ta\™ @ 
the diagrams and models used in teaching mensuration, 
square and cube root blocks, ete. 
Conventional objects used simply as abstract objects, 
number pictures, diagrams, and models all have the advan- 
tage of being always available and very economical of 
time but they have the disadvantage of being less objective
-P-A-G-E-79
  OBJECTIVE WORK 73 
—more abstract than the other types. For this reason 
their use should be avoided at first but as the child develops 
they may be used to save time and they further serve as 
a transition from the concrete stage to the abstract sym- 
bolic stage. 
The objective work can be made meaningful and real 
if it is unified around some life situation and if the various 
types of objects used grow naturally out of that situation. 
The three types of situations most useful for this purpose 
are: 
1. Dramatization of stories, pictures and problems; and 
the playing of store, postman, bank, stock exchange, etc. 
These are not only objective situations themselves but also 
unify and make real the large variety of objects used in 
the dramatization of the complex situation. 
2. Games also present a real, concrete situation and serve 
to unify the various objects used. For discussion of games, 
see Chapter VI, Part IIT. 
3. Measuring and Construction Work. Much of the 
arithmetic of the primary grades should be correlated with 
and grow out of the work in Industrial Arts or the con- 
struction work. This work constantly presents new num- 
ber ideas and facts in a concrete way and unifies and 
renders meaningful the various types of objective material 
used,

  CHAPTER IV 
THE DEDUCTIVE LESSON IN ARITHMETIC 
Definition. We have already considered the type of 
thinking through which the pupils discover general truths 
by the observation and examination of particular cases. 
As soon as they have acquired even a limited stock of gen- 
eral knowledge, another kind of thinking becomes possible, - 
namely,jthe type of thinking in which they overcome a 
difficult¥ by the use of general truths that they 7, 
already accepted as valid Such thinking is called deduc- 
tive thinking, or deduction. It may arise in arithmetic in 
three different ways according to the nature of the diffi- 
culty to be overcome, but it is always the same in that the 
difficulty is met not by the study of individual cases as in 
induction but by the direct application of general prin- 
ciples. 
THREE TYPES OF DEDUCTION IN ARITHMETIC 
The Solution of Problems. The difficulty, or. problem, 
may be some concrete, arithmetical situation which is met 
by applying general knowledge. Thus when the pupils 
meet the situation of determining how much three articles 
will cost at five cents each, they solve it by using their 
knowledge that 3X5 is always 15 and do not have to 
resort to counting. The solution of every applied problem 
in arithmetic involves this type of deductive thinking and 
it will be considered in Part IV in connection with the 
discussion of problem solving. 
Deductive Discovery. Again the problem may be to dis- 
cover some new. truth. General truths are not always 
discovered by examining individual cases but may also 
74
-P-A-G-E-81
DEDUCTIVE LESSON 75 
be discovered by putting together and rearranging known 
truths in new ways. This type of deductive thinking is 
often used in geometry. For example, the student, by 
making use of old knowledge (axioms, definitions, previous 
propositions, ete.), arrives at the new knowledge that the 
‘angles opposite the two equal sides of an isosceles triangle 
are equal, without having to examine and measure the 
angles of a large number of such triangles. 
Deductive Explanation. Finally the problem may be to 
verify or explain some general truth previously discovered 
“and accepted. Some doubt may have arisen as to the gen- 
eral validity of the truth or the pupils may have raised 
the question as to why it is true. In order to prove that 
a truth is universal, or to explain why it is true, it 
is necessary to show that it is the result of other truths 
already accepted as valid. The thinking involved is thus 
deductive. 
Depuctive Discovery—THeE DepuctivE DEVELOPMENT 
Lesson 
As soon as the pupils have a fund of general knowledge, 
it is possible for them to arrive at new truths by combin- 
ing and rearranging old without having to resort to the 
observation and study of individual cases. The type of 
recitation in which the pupils are thus led to formulate 
new truths from old is usually called the Deductive Devel- 
opment Lesson although, as will be seen later, it usually 
involves induction as well as deduction. 
Steps in the Deductive Development Lesson. The steps 
or phases of the deductive development lesson are: 
(a) The problem—to discover some rule, principle, 
process or fact. 
(b) The recall and combination, under the guidance of 
the teacher, of the general truth or truths of which the 
new truth is the consequence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  76 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
(c) The formation of a tentative conclusion or hypothe- 
sis, and the verification of the supposed truth through 
induction, that is, by the examination of particular cases 
to see if the supposed truth holds. 
(d) ‘The final generalization. 
(e) The application of the truth. 
The inductive and deductive types of discovery both 
begin with a problem, form an hypothesis, and verify it, 
formulate a general conclusion and then apply it. These 
steps are identical in the two types of development and 
all that has already been said about them in the discussion 
of the inductive type of development, applies equally as 
well to the deductive type and need not be repeated here. 
Verification. The step of verification is necessary as a 
check on the reasoning process by means of which the 
new truth was obtained. The ultimate test of the validity 
of any supposed truth is to see if it tallies with observed 
facts, to see if it works out in experience. An hypothesis 
arrived at by a line of deductive thought without refer- 
ence to concrete situations should always be verified by 
applying it to concrete situations in order to see if it 
really works. 
Difference Between Inductive and Deductive Develop- 
ment. The only difference between the inductive and de- 
ductive types of development is in the method used in 
forming the hypothesis. In the deductive development, 
instead of examining and comparing individual cases to 
discover the new truth, the teacher and pupils review 
their stock of general knowledge to see if they already 
have any knowledge that may help them to solve the new 
difficulty. No general directions can be given for this 
step but its nature should be clear from the following 
illustrations.

DEDUCTIVE LESSON 17 
A DepuctivE DEVELOPMENT OF RULE FoR MULTIPLYING AN 
IntEGER By 100 
Problem. To discover a short way of multiplying an in- / 
teger by 100. 
Recall and Combination of @1d Knowledge. The teacher 
first reviews with the pupils the short way of multiplying 
by 10, namely, by annexing one cipher at the right. The. 
fact that 100 is equal to 1010 is next considered and 
therefore that multiplying by 10 and that result by 10 is 
the same as multiplying by 100. 
Hypothesis and Verification. From this the pupils form 
the hypothesis that in order to multiply by 100 they must 
annex two ciphers. This concluson is then verified by 
applying it to cases such as 10027 and checking the 
result obtained by adding twenty-seven 100’s, or by multi- 
plying 100 by 27.

Generalization. Having verified their hypothesis, the 
pupils state a rule, as: “To multiply an integer by 100, 
annex two ciphers at’/the right.” 
Application. The rule is then applied to abstract drill 
examples to make sure that the pupils understand and can 
use it and to start fixing it in their minds. Application 
might also be made to concrete problems. 
A DepuctiveE DeveLopMENT oF RuLE For AREA OF 
RECTANGLE 
Problem. To find a short way of determining the area 
of a rectangle.
-P-A-G-E-84
  718 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Recall and Combination of Old Knowledge. Each pupil 
is supplied with several rectangular pieces of cardboard 
whose dimensions are all an integral number of inches, 
with a supply of square inches cut from cardboard, and with 
a foot rule. The teacher reviews the meaning of measur- 
ing and sees that the pupils know that to measure is to 
find how many times some standard unit is contained in 
the magnitude to be measured. The pupils already have 
had some experience in finding areas of rectangles by fold- 
ing into square inches, or by fitting on square inches and 
counting, and this is reviewed at this time. The pupils 
take rectangles, 3 inches by 4 inches, and find the area by 
covering with square inches and counting. Their rectan- 
gles then look as follows: 
Next, the teacher points out that this method of finding 
the area is long and inconvenient, and interests the pupils 
in finding a shorter method. The pupils already know 
how to find the number of desks in the room, or the num- 
ber of postage stamps in a sheet without counting them 
one by one. This knowledge is reviewed and applied to 
the problem in hand, leading the pupils to see that “The 
number of square inches in the rectangle equals the num- 
ber of rows times the number of square inches in one row.” 
Next, the possibility of finding how many rows there 
will be and how many square inches in each row without 
fitting on the square inches is considered and the pupils 
are led to see that, since each square inch is one inch 
wide, there will always be as many square inches in one 
row as there are inches in the base; and, since each row 
is one inch high there will always be as many rows as 
there are inches in the altitude.
-P-A-G-E-85
DEDUCTIVE LESSON 719 
Hypothesis and Verification. From the above the pupils 
form the hypothesis that the area of a rectangle may be 
found by multiplying the number of inches in the base 
by the number of inches in the altitude. This hypothesis 
is verified by taking the other rectangles, measuring the 
base and altitude of each with the foot rule and multi- 
plying. The result thus obtained is then checked by fitting 
on square inches and counting. 
Generalization. Having verified their hypothesis the 
pupils formulate the rule, “The area of a rectangle is equal 
to the product of the base and the altitude.” This rule 
should also be stated in abbreviated form as A~a Xb. 
Application. The application should be to actual rect- 
angles such as the tops of the pupils’ and teacher’s desks, 
the room itself, ete. In each case the pupils should first 
make the proper measurements for themselves and then 
determine the area. 
The following inductive developments of the same rules, 
if carefully compared with the deductive developments 
given above, will make clear the difference between dis- 
covery by induction and discovery by deduction, partic- 
ularly if the student will remember that the fundamental 
difference between the two methods is that in the first 
the new truth is arrived at by the study and comparison 
of individual, concrete cases, while in the second, it is 
reasoned out from general truths already accepted as valid.

The results in these examples might be found by any 
one of several different methods. The pupils might get

adding seven 100’s, or by multiplying 100 by 7.

Having obtained the results by any of these methods 
the teacher gets the pupils interested in finding a short 
way of obtaining the results. To do this they compare 
the result with the original number in each case and find 
that the result is always the original number followed by 
two ciphers. 
Hypothesis and Verification. Same as in the deductive 
development given above.

him two or more rectangles as follows: 
E- [efel 4” 5”   
  
           
-P-A-G-E-87
DEDUCTIVE LESSON 81 
Again the question of finding an easy method for deter- 
mining the area is raised. In order to do this the teacher 
ealls the pupils’ attention to the altitude, base and area 
of each rectangle and they see that the altitude of the 
first is 3 inches, its base 4 inches and its area 12 square 
inches. In the second rectangle they see that the altitude 
is 4 inches, the base 5 inches and the area 20 square inches. 
Hypothesis and Verification. By noting the relation be- 
tween the altitude, base, and area in the two rectangles, 
the pupils form the same hypothesis as in the deductive 
development and verify it in the same way. 
Generalization. Same as in deductive development. 
Application. Same as in deductive development. 
CoMBINATION OF INDUCTIVE AND DepuctTivE MrrHops 
The Two Methods Not Distinct. For convenience of de- 
scription the inductive and deductive methods of develop- 
ment have been considered separately. In actual teaching 
the two methods are often combined so that a given devel. 
opment lesson may be of neither type but a combination 
of both. In discovering a new truth the teacher need not 
confine herself to the examination of individual cases 
nor to the use of general principles already known, but 
can make use of both as they best serve her purpose. 
Illustrations. In developing the rule for finding the 
volume of a cone, the pupils may, by using hollow models 
and filling with sand, establish inductively the fact that 
the volume of a cone is always just one-third the volume 
of a cylinder having the same base and altitude. Using 
this fact and the rule that the volume of a cylinder is 
equal to the product of its base and altitude, they arrive 
deductively at the conclusion that the volume of a cone 
is one-third the product of its base and its altitude. 
If, in the deductive development of the rule for finding 
the area of a rectangle, which was given above, the pupils 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  82 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
have difficulty in seeing that the number of square inches 
in a row is always the same as the number of inches in 
the base, they could take several rectangles with different 
bases and by fitting on the square inches and counting, 
find that if the rectangle is 4 inches long there are 4 
square inches in each row; if the rectangle is 6 inches 
long there are 6 square inches in each row, ete. If this 
is done the development of this particular point is induc- 
tive but the whole lesson might still be called deductive 
as the main trend of thought is deductive. 
In the inductive development of the rule for multiplying 
an integer by 100, given above, the results of the indi- 
vidual cases 1007, 1009, and 10023 were found by 
using the pupils’ previous knowledge of multiplication. 
This part of the development was therefore deductive. 
The final hypothesis (the rule for multiplying an integer 
by 100) was discovered by comparing the individual cases, 
that is, by induction. Such a development, although partly 
deductive, is usually called inductive because the hypothe- 
sis is obtained by induction. 
Objective Development May Be Purely Inductive. The 
only purely inductive developments in arithmetic are those 
in the very beginning in which objective situations are 
studied and compared and in which the hypothesis is 
formed from the objective situations themselves, without 
the aid of general knowledge already in the pupils’ pos- 
session. 
Not Necessary to Distinguish Between Two Methods. In 
actual teaching the two methods are usually so interwoven 
that it is often impossible to say whether a given devel- 
opment is more inductive or deductive, and it is not at 
all necessary to do so as the teacher in discovering new 
knowledge has at her disposal both the method of exam- 
ining and comparing individual cases and the method of 
applying general truths already accepted, and can use
-P-A-G-E-89
  DEDUCTIVE LESSON 83 
either or both as best serves her purpose. In other 
respects, as has been shown, the two methods of develop- 
ment are identical so no distinction need be made. 
Tue ADVANTAGES AND Limirations or Each Meruop 
The teacher should keep in mind, however, the follow- 
ing with respect to the two methods: 
I. In general the inductive method of development is 
the easier for the pupils because it is more concrete. The 
deductive method is more difficult because it is more ab- 
stract. For this reason the purely deductive method is 
seldom used in the grades except in developing the simplest 
facts. ; 
II. Inductive discovery is possible from the first grade, 
while the deductive method is not possible until the pupils 
have accumulated a store of general knowledge in arith- 
metic. 
III. The deductive method is usually shorter and there- 
fore more economical of time. For this reason it should 
be used whenever it is not too difficult for the pupils. 
IV. Inductive development is. incomplete in itself; as 
has already been pointed out, it serves only to discover 
what seems to be true. It does not prove that the apparent 
truth holds in all cases. <A certain relationship might hold 
in ninety-nine cases and fail in the hundredth. Further, 
pure induction shows what is apparently true but does 
not show why it is true. It discovers isolated bits of 
knowledge but does not show the relation of the new 
knowledge to other knowledge that the pupils already have 
in their possession. 
DeEpucTIVE EXPLANATION 
Definition. A truth known only as a separate, isolated 
truth is only half known. To be fully known it must be 
fitted into its proper place in connection with other truths 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  84 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
so as to form an organized body of knowledge. By induc- 
tion one can discover that multiplying both the numerator 
and denominator of a fraction by the same number does 
not change the value of the fraction; by deduction one 
can see that this truth is not just a happen-so but the 
necessary and direct consequence of our previously accepted 
definitions and principles. The new truth is explained 
when it is fitted in with and seen to be the consequence 
of known truths, and it is in this sense that the term 
explanation is used throughout this book. 
When to Explain. Truths discovered by induction must 
later be explained by deduction. In some cases the ex- 
planation follows immediately upon the discovery, in other 
cases it is postponed for several years. The ideal time 
to give an explanation is when the pupils see the need 
for it and become interested in the why of the rule 
or process. In the beginning, the pupils are chiefly inter- 
ested in finding out what is true but later they also become’ 
interested in seeing why things are true. Just when this 
interest in the why of things begins, no one can say, as 
it varies in different individuals. Certainly no deductive 
explanation should be attempted in the primary and lower 
intermediate grades; the problem there is to lead the 
pupils to discover truth. 
Even in the lower grades, it is true, the pupils are con- 
stantly asking “Why?”, and we often mistake this for an 
interest in reasons and causes whereas it is usually only 
an interest in discovering what is true. The following 
incident illustrates the point. A child and his father were 
standing on the platform in front of a railroad station 
watching some sparrows. The boy asked his father for 
one of the sparrows to play with and the father told him 
he could not have it. The child immediately asked “Why?” 
and the following dialogue ensued: 
“Because I can’t catch it.”
-P-A-G-E-91
DEDUCTIVE LESSON 85 
“Why?” 
“Because I can’t fly?” 
“Why?” 
“Because I haven’t any wings.” 
“Why?” 
“Because God did not give me any.” 
“Why?” 
This was too much for the father, so he threatened to 
punish the boy if he did not stop asking so many questions. 
How much better it would have been if the father, when 
his son asked him for a sparrow, had suggested that they 
try to catch one. How long would it have taken to thor- 
oughly convince the boy that he could not have a sparrow 
with which to play? The boy’s “Why?” was not a demand 
for a reason but simply meant that he was not yet con- 
vineed. 
In the intermediate and in the grammar grades, some 
of the brighter pupils become interested in the why and 
are perfectly capable of following the deductive thinking 
involved in the explanation’ of some of the more simple 
truths of arithmetic which they have previously discovered 
by induction. Thus in reviewing fractions in the eighth 
grade the pupils, although they have known for years that 
multiplying both terms of a fraction by the same number 
does not change the value of the fraction, are interested 
in considering why this is true. 
The Teacher’s Function. The teacher should not thrust 
explanations on the pupils, but should do all in her power 
to arouse and stimulate the pupils’ interest in knowing the 
why of things and when the question arises should be 
ready to give the explanation or help the pupils find it 
for themselves. This should not be taken to mean that 
long formal explanations should be demanded of the pupils. 
Even in the upper grades, the pupils may not be able 
to reason out and give formal explanations for themselves
-P-A-G-E-92
86 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
but they are entirely capable of seeing relationships when 
they are pointed out by the teacher. | 
Illustration. As an illustration of this type of deductive 
work, let us consider the rule for multiplying an integer 
by ten. Suppose this rule has been worked out inductively 
in the fourth grade and it is being reviewed in the sixth 
grade as a preparation for extending to the case of multi- 
plying a decimal by 10. The pupils have stated the rule, 
“To multiply a number by ten annex a cipher to the 
right,” and the question has arisen “Why does annexing 
a cipher multiply a number by 10?” To help the pupils 
discover the answer to this question, the teacher writes 
on the board the number 384 and, by questioning the 
pupils about the place value of each digit both before and 
after annexing the cipher, brings out the explanation, 
namely, that annexing a cipher multiplies a number by 
ten because it pushes each digit one place to the left and 
into a place whose value is ten times as great as that of 
the place previously occupied by the digit. 
Steps in Deductive Explanation. This illustration shows 
the stages or phases of this kind of deductive thinking: 
(a) The problem, some general truth to be verified or 
explained, (b) The recall and selection, under the guidance 
of the teacher, of the general truth or truths that explain 
or prove the given truth, and (c) The formulation of the 
explanation. These stages do not represent separate and 
distinct steps that must be taken in that particular order 
but rather different phases of the thinking that must be 
done in order to arrive at the explanation. 
Illustrations. As another illustration of this sort of 
work suppose the question has arisen, “Why does multi- 
plying the denominator of a fraction divide the value of 
the fraction?” The teacher might help the pupils form 
their own explanation by questions such as, “In the frac- 
tion % what does the denominator, 4, tell?” (The number 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
ee ee ee RET ee 
DEDUCTIVE LESSON 87 
of equal parts into which the whole has been divided.) 
“What does the numerator, 3, tell?” (The number of 
equal parts that we have in our fraction.) ‘Picture the 
fraction %.” 
WI) 
  LMA 
_—— 7 
“Tf you multiply the denominator by 2, how many parts 
will there be in the whole?” (8.) ‘Picture the resulting 
fraction, %.” 
WT 
  sce 
“Are there more or fewer parts in the whole than 
before?” (More, just twice as many.) “Are they larger 
or smaller?” (Just half as large.) “So multiplying the 
denominator by 2 did what to the fraction?” (Made it 
just half as large, or divided it by 2.) “Why?” (Because 
it made twice as many parts in the whole and so they 
were just half as large.) 
As a final illustration suppose the pupils have just 
discovered the rule for finding the area of a rectangle, 
and have discovered it by the inductive method given above. 
The question might arise as to why the rule works. 
The teacher could then show the pupils that the number 
of inches in the altitude is the same as the number of rows 
of square inches and that the number of inches in the 
base is the same as the number of square inches in one
-P-A-G-E-94
88 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Ah 
row, so that when they multiply the number of inches in 
the base by the number of inches in the altitude they are 
really multiplying the number of square inches in one 
row by the number of rows and so the result obtainea 
represents the number of -square inches in the rectangle, 
that is, the area of the rectangle.

  CHAPTER V 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IDEAS 
The Basic Ideas of Arithmetic. One of the most import- 
tant tasks of the teacher, particularly. in the primary 
grades, is to see that the pupils get certain ideas that are 
fundamental to the work in arithmetic. The most impor- 
tant of these are (a) Number Ideas, (b) Fraction Ideas, 
(c) Operation Ideas, (d) Geometric Ideas, and (e) Meas- 
uring Ideas. This side of the teaching of arithmetic has 
been badly neglected in the past. Formerly, the symbol 
as 3 or % was given first and it was thought that the pupils 
would get the idea from the symbol. Today the teacher 
first sees that the pupils get the idea through concrete 
experience and then gives the symbol. Too often in the 
past the pupils have been dealing with meaningless symbols 
instead of with ideas. The author was once asked to help 
a boy in the fifth grade who had become completely lost 
and bewildered in the work with fractions. It only took 
a few minutes to locate the difficulty, the boy did not 
know the meaning of fraction; two-thirds called to his 
mind nothing but the symbol %. After a few days spent 
on concrete, objective representation of fractions, the boy 
had acquired clear fraction ideas and in a few more days 
caught up with his class and had no further difficulty. 
Numeer Ippas 
The pupils when they enter school usually have certain 
number concepts. These, however, are apt to be rather ‘ 
vague and uncertain and there is usually great variation 
between individual pupils. It is the duty of the teacher 
in the primary grades to take this knowledge of the pupils 
89
-P-A-G-E-96
  90 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
and extend and clarify it so as to form a firm and depend- 
able basis for the future work in numbers. f 
Number Idea Complex. The number idea is very com- 
plex and is not acquired all at one time but gradually and 
as the result of wide and varied experience. The pupils’ 
first ideas are of necessity incomplete and vague and must 
be added to and clarified by further experience. Thus 
the complete concept of six involves the notion of posi- 
tion in a series, as the sixth pupil in a row, or the sixth 
house from the corner; the idea of the number in a group, 
as six pencils or six boys; the idea of magnitude, as a 
line six inches long or an object that weighs six pounds; 
the knowledge that six is one more than five and one less 
than seven, two more than four and two less than eight, 
ete.; and the knowledge that six is made up of two threes 
or three twos. 
Order and Method of Developing. The best order and 
the best means of developing these various number ideas 
has long been a matter of dispute. This question will 
not be entered into here, as we have no convincing evidence 
on either side and the whole question is probably much 
less important than it has usually been considered. The 
important thing is that the pupils gradually develop a 
comprehensive understanding of six and of each of the 
other numbers and as long as they do this the means used 
and the particular order in which the elements of the 
complex idea are grasped are matters of comparatively 
little importance. The following scheme for developing 
‘the number ideas is not presented as the only method 
but simply as one possible method. 
Number as a Sequence. ,The pupils first get the idea of 
number as meaning position in a series.“ This is obtained 
through rote counting. This cae to fix in the 
pupils’ minds the sequence of the numbers. Much practice 
should be given in counting objects of various sorts with-
-P-A-G-E-97
  DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IDEAS 91 
out any attempt at first to have the pupils recognize any 
of these numbers of things. Number rhymes such as the 
following can be used to advantage in this connection: 
“One, two, buckle my shoe, 
Three, four, bolt the door, 
Five, six, pick up sticks, 
Seven, eight, lay them straight, 
Nine, ten, a good fat hen.” 
“One, two, three, four, five, 
I caught a hare alive, 
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 
I let him go again.” 
Fortunately children like to count for the sake of count- 
ing and this natural liking should be taken advantage of 
in teaching numbers. This kind of counting is called rote - 
counting and should go considerably beyond the pupils’ 
present number needs. 
Number as a Measure. Having become acquainted with 
the sequence of the numbers from rote counting the pupils 
must get the idea of number as answering the questions 
“How many?” and “How much?” They can do this by 
counting groups of objects and by measuring. Thus the 
“how many” idea of six is obtained by counting various 
groups of six objects each, as six apples, six boys, six 
girls, six hair-ribbons, ete.; and by doing things six times, 
as tapping a bell, clapping the hands, knocking on the door, 
taking steps, etc. Counting of this kind is called rational 
counting. 
Through their experience in the rational counting of 
objects the pupils should get such a definite idea of two, 
three, and four that they can recognize groups of two, 
three, and four objects at sight without stopping to
-P-A-G-E-98
    
92 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
count, and can recognize larger groups by breaking them 
up into groups of twos, threes, and fours. Thus a group 
of seven objects should be recognized without counting, 
by mentally grouping into three and four. Some pupils 
ean recognize five or, in some instances, even a larger 
number of objects without counting, but four seems to be 
the maximum for most pupils. 
The “how much” idea is developed through measuring 
and the pupils should be given much practice in this kind 
of work, using all of the common standard units of meas- 
ure. Thus the pupils get the “how much” idea of six by 
measuring lines six inches long, measuring out six pints 
of water, ete. 
Rational counting and measuring are both necessary to 
the development of complete number ideas and should be 
carried on together, starting as soon as the sequence of 
the first ten numbers has been memorized through rote 
counting. Through these two activities the number names 
and symbols for the smaller numbers become something 
more than mere words and symbols to the pupils and grad- 
ually come to stand for definite ideas. ji 
Just how far the pupils can get clear ideas of the 
numbers represented by the words and symbols is a ques- 
tion difficult to answer. Before they leave school 100 
should undoubtedly stand for a distinct conception and 
possibly the same is true of 1000. Most adults probably 
have no definite conception of numbers above a thousand. 
Learning Each Number in Its Relation to Other Numbers. 
A number is not completely known when it is known as 
standing for a definite place in the sequence and as answer- 
ing the questions “how many?” and “how much?” The 
pupils may be able to count up to and beyond six, and 
may also be able to recognize and form groups of six 
objects, and to repeat simple acts six times, but they do 
not have the complete idea “six” until they know six
-P-A-G-E-99
  
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IDEAS 93 
in all of its relations to the other numbers. They already 
know from rote counting that six comes after five and 
before seven, and they probably know from rational count- 
ing and measuring that six is one more than five and 
one less than seven. They must also know that six is 
two more than four, three more than three, two less than 
eight, three less than nine, etc.; and that six is made up 
of two 3’s or three 2’s. These relations can be obtained 
partially through rote counting by 1’s, 2’s, 3’s, ete., but 
to make them stand for concrete ideas they must also be 
worked out by making comparisons of objects and groups 
of objects. Thus, the pupils find that there are three more 
objects in a group of nine than in a group of six, and that 
a line nine inches long is three inches longer than one 
that is just six inches long. The comparisons at first 
should be indefinite, as “Which group is the larger?” 
“Which line the longer?” ete. This should be followed by 
work in which the comparisons are made definitely with 
the aid of counting and measuring, in order to tell “how 
much larger?” or “how much longer?” Indefinite com- 
parisons should start before the work in rational counting 
and measuring, and the making of definite comparisons 
should grow out of the indefinite comparisons and should 
provide the motive for much of the rational counting and 
measuring. The ideas and many of the facts of subtrac- 
tion, and multiplication grow directly out of the work in 
making comparisons. ‘ 
Fraction Ipzas 
Fraction Idea Complex. ~{he fraction idea, like the num- 
ber idea, is a complex one and is a gradual growth as 
a result of the pupils’ experience.7 The following outline 
shows approximately the stages iw the development of the 
complete fraction idea.  
-P-A-G-E-100
  94 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
I. Unit Fractions. %, %, %, ete. ‘Wy Me 
(a) Part of a single object, as 
(b) Part of a group of objects, as ON OW0N O20 0   ya iain 
(c) Comparison of two single objects, as: pint—'% of 
a quart; foot—% of a yard; one object % as large as 
another, as esl seis] 
(d) Comparison of two groups, 0 0 0 is % as many as 
000 000. 
All four of these ideas of the simple unit fractions should 
be started as early as possible—in the first grade if any 
number work is done there. The order in which the pupils 
obtain these four ideas of % is of no importance. Some 
teachers start with the comparison idea, using the pint 
and the quart as the first introduction to the fraction 
idea. Most teachers prefer to start with the part idea, 
regarding it as more simple. When this is done the pupils’ 
experience in sharing single objects and groups of objects 
with others can be made the introduction to fractions. 
The important thing is that the pupils in their concrete 
experiences with % meet all four of the ideas; % of an 
object, 4 of a group, one object % as large as another, and 
one group containing % as many objects as another group.

III. Improper Fractions. %, %, ete. Improper frac- 
tions are first met late in the third or early in the fourth 
grade and arise from the work in addition of fractions, 
as %-+%—%. When encountered in this way their mean- 
ing should be made clear by picturing them objectively, 
using both single objects and groups as the unit.

Later the idea of one object being % or 1% times as 
large as another object, and one group or number being 
48 or 1% times as large as another group or number must 
be introduced. If necessary, these ideas may also be 
objectified.

IV. Indicated Division. The idea of a fraction as an 
indicated division, as 14%—12--3. This idea is first met 
in connection with reducing an improper fraction to a 
mixed number. The pupils already know that %—4, or 
if they do not they can picture 1% as Eight is 
foes sa ea) 
They also know that 12+3—4. Therefore it is evident 
that 14%—12~3. From this and similar cases the pupils 
see that a fraction is an indicated division.
-P-A-G-E-102
  96 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
OPERATION IDEAS 
One of the most important purposes of the work in the 
primary grades is to give the pupils clear, usable ideas 
of the four fundamental operations of addition, subtrac- 
tion, multiplication, and division. These ideas are obtained 
through the work with objective situations, already dis- 
cussed, and through the solution of concrete problems 
involving these operations. The test of whether the pupils 
have clear ideas of these operations is their ability to 
recognize addition, subtraction, multiplication and division 
problems. 
The Addition Idea. The addition idea is comparatively 
simple. Through the work with objects and problems the 
pupils come to think of addition as a putting together or 
combining process. No formal definition of any of the 
processes should be attempted in the grades. 
The Subtraction Idea. Mathematically, subtraction is 
simply the inverse of addition. It is the process by which 
the second addend is found when the sum of two addends 
and one of the addends is known. This idea of subtrac- 
tion is too abstract for pupils in the grades. The impor- 
tant thing for them is that they be able to recognize the 
various types of problems that are solved by means of 
subtraction. There are three of these types. 
(a) The Remainder or Take Away type. 
“Tf Johnny has seven pieces of candy and eats two, how 
many does he have left?” 
(b) The Difference or Comparison idea. 
“Mary has 7 apples and Julia has 2. How many more 
apples does Mary have than Julia?” 
(c) The Additive idea. 
“Johnny sees a toy in a shop window marked 10¢. If 
he has 7¢, how many more must he have to buy the toy?” 
If the pupils are taught to subtract by the take-away 
method their fundamental idea of subtraction will be the
-P-A-G-E-103
  
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IDEAS 97 
take-away idea, but they must know that subtraction 
is also used to find how-much larger one number is than 
another, and to find how much must be added to a smaller 
number to make a larger, as well as to find what is left 
when part is taken away. They get this knowledge from 
meeting plenty of subtraction problems of all three types. 
On the other hand, if the pupils are taught to subtract 
by the additive or Austrian method they look upon 
subtraction as the process of adding to a smaller number 
to get a larger, but again they must learn from experience 
with problems of all three types that subtraction is used 
in the two other types of problems. To avoid confusion 
the objective work should be carried out according to the 
particular plan to be used in subtraction. That is, in work- 
ing out the subtraction fact ee the pupils should start 
with seven objects, take away three and count the re- 
mainder if they are to subtract by the take-away method. 
But if they are to subtract by the additive method they 
should start with three objects and add enough to make 
seven, counting the number added. As soon as the pupils 
have passed the objective stage they must meet problems 
of all three types. 
The Multiplication Idea. ~Pupils gain their idea of mul- 
tiplication from working with objects and from concrete 
problems. They regard multiplication as the “times proc- 
ess” or the process of finding what three 2’s or seven 8’s 
equals without adding. Again no formal abstract defini- 
tion should be attempted. The test of the pupils’ grasp 
of the multiplication idea is their ability to recognize con- 
erete multiplication problems and to distinguish them from 
addition, subtraction, and division problems. 
The Division Idea. Mathematically, division is the in- 
verse of multiplication. It is the process in which the 
product of two factors and one of the factors is known,
-P-A-G-E-104
  98 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
to find the other factor. Thus two cases arise depending 
on whether the known factor is the multiplier or the multi- 
plicand. In the example 3X$4—$12, 3 tells the number 
of parts, $4 the number of dollars in each part, and $12 
the number of dollars in the whole. Corresponding to 
this multiplication situation there are two inverse division 
situations, namely, $12+$4—?, and $12+3=—? In the 
first of these the number of dollars in the whole and the 
number of dollars in each part are known to find the 
number of parts. Briefly, the question is “How many $4’s 
are there in $12?” In the second the number of dollars 
in the whole and the number of equal parts are known to 
find the number of dollars in each part. Briefly, the 
question is “If $12 is divided into 3 equal parts, how many 
dollars are there in each part?” Evidently another way 
of stating this question is “% of $12—?” 
The pupils’ first and fundamental idea of division is 
based on the first situation given above, that is, the pupils 
think of division primarily as “finding how many times 
one number is contained in another.” The objective work 
in division is all based on this idea. At the same time, 
however, that the pupils are finding objectively how many 
2’s there are in 8, ete., and calling the process division, 
they are also dividing 8 into 4 equal parts and finding 
1% of 8. Later the pupils learn that the short way to find 
% of a number is to divide the number by 4. So the 
pupils not only think of division as “finding how many 
times one number is contained in another” but also know 
that division is used to find parts of numbers. Plenty 
of conerete division problems of both kinds must be met 
and solved by the pupils. 
Geometric IpEas 
The pupils before leaving the grades should know the 
names of and be able to recognize the common geometric
-P-A-G-E-105
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IDEAS vy) 
forms, such as the square, rectangle (oblong), triangle, 
circle, cube, and sphere. The important thing is that the 
pupils be able to recognize these figures, not that they learn 
formal definitions. 
Measurine IpEas 
Another group of ideas fundamental to the arithmetic 
work in the grades is the group connected with measuring. 
These are (a) the idea of measuring and (b) the ideas of 
the standard units of measure. 
The Idea of Measuring. the measuring idea is the nat- 
ural outgrowth of the work in making comparisons. As 
previously stated the first comparisons should be indefinite, 
simply “this is larger than that,” “this is shorter than 
that,” ete. Later the desire to make more accurate com- 
parisons, to tell “how much larger” and “how much 
shorter,” makes it necessary to introduce the idea of meas- 
uring a magnitude by comparing it to another known 
magnitude of the same kind that is used as a unit of 
measure. At first the units used in measuring should be 
indefinite units such as the pace, the length of the finger, 
ete. Later the standard units should be introduced. 
The Ideas of the Standard Units. It is not enough that 
the pupils know the names of the standard units and the 
relations between them (Tables); the important thing is 
that they have a clear idea of the more common units such 
as the inch, the foot, the pound, ete. These can only be 
obtained by much practice in measuring, using these units, 
and in estimating quantities and then verifying the esti- 
mate by measuring. The test of whether the pupils know 
what an inch is or not, is their ability to estimate lengths. 
If they guess that a three-inch line is five inches long 
they evidently have no very accurate idea of an inch, but 
by continued estimating and verifying by measuring they 
will gradually get a correct idea.

Illustration. As has already been stated the teacher can 
not convey a new idea such as the idea “square,” “one- 
half,” or “7” to the pupils through words; the pupils can 
only grasp the idea through their own experithee. To 
make clear the process by which a new general idea or 
concept is acquired let us consider how a baby gets the 
concept “dog.” In the first place the child must see not 
one dog but several dogs and these dogs must not be all 
alike in any way except in that they are all dogs. If the 
dogs seen are all white the child will think that whiteness 
is a necessary attribute of dogs and will fail to recognize 
a black dog. Seeing a variety of dogs is not enough how- 
ever. Each time some adult must be present to give the 
name dog. The formation of a general idea is a process 
of abstraction. At first the child connects the mime dog 
with an individual dog, say a small, white, curly dog; 
then a large, black, short-haired animal is pointed out to 
him and called dog and so by seeing dogs of all kinds and 
having the name dog given him each time, the child grad- 
ually comes to associate the word dog not with any par- 
ticular dog but with those attributes that are conimon to 
all dogs. 
As soon as the baby gets an imperfect concept dog 
he will probably try to use it. He will point to a small 
four-legged animal and say “Dog.” The animal happens, 
however, to be a cat and the baby is corrected by some 
adult. In this way, through use, the vague, imperfect idea 
is gradually clarified and perfected and becomes a perma- 
nent possession of the baby’s mind. From this illustration 
it is seen that the acquisition of a new idea is essentially 
an inductive process and goes through the same phases as 
all other inductive thinking. 
The Steps Can Not be Separated. The different phases
-P-A-G-E-107
  DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IDEAS 101 
of inductive thinking are never separate and distinct and 
this is particularly true in the development of an idea. 
The phases are usually so merged together that no line 
can be drawn between them. Indeed they are usually 
carried on practically at the same time. As each case is 
studied, attention is directed towards the essential elements 
and a name or other symbol is connected with it; and as 
soon as the idea is partially grasped, the pupil commences 
to use it and through use verifies and fixes the idea. Hach 
phase of thought is, however, present, and to be unaware 
of, or neglect any of these phases, is to invite failure. 
The inductive development of an idea often differs from 
the development of facts or processes in still another way. 
In the latter the induction is conscious, in the former it is 
often wnconscious. 
Selection of Cases. The teacher must remember two 
things in this connection. (1) A general idea can not be 
obtained from a single instance. Several situations having 
one element in common must be presented. (2) These 
situations must be different in all ways except in respect 
to the one common element. 
Comparison and Abstraction. As the pupils meet each 
situation their attention must be directed toward the essen- 
tial element, or elements, common to all the situations. 
The pupils can not get the idea square by looking at 
square objects if they are thinking about their size or 
color; they must be made to think about their shape. 
The most important ways of directing the attention toward 
the required element are by using situations in which the 
element is just as prominent as possible, and by using a 
variety of situations having only the one element that is 
common to all of them. This one element will stand out 
from the others because it is the one thing present in all. 
Sometimes attention can be directed towards the common 
elements by leading the pupils to compare the different
-P-A-G-E-108
102 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
situations, eliminate the varying elements and pick out 
those that are common. Thus in the case of the square 
the pupils might be shown several squares of different 
sizes, colors and materials. They might compare and find 
these differences and then look for likenesses, finding that 
they all have four corners, and four sides and that the sides 
are all equal. Finally, the pupils’ attention can sometimes 
be directed towards the desired elements by reviewing 
other similar ideas that they already have. In developing 
the idea of 7 the pupils can be made to think about 
number and not size, shape, color, or something else by 
reviewing briefly the numbers that they already know. 
Generalization. In the case of an idea, the step of gen- 
eralization can not be separated from the other steps. 
The generalization is made more or less unconsciously as 
the various individual cases are met. To aid the pupils 
in unconsciously generalizing, a word or other symbol must 
be given with each of the individuals or situations as it is 
presented, so that eventually it will come to be connected 
in the pupils’ minds not with any one of the different 
situations but only with the elements common to all. 
Further, the generalization can not always be formally 
made in words. It would be extremely difficult, for in- 
stance, to state clearly in words the common elements that 
go to make up a dog and distinguish dogs from cats and 
other animals of the same general size and shape. In the 
ease of arithmetical ideas the pupils can generalize in 
words their idea of square or of % but cannot very easily 
put in words their idea of 9. 
Verification and Application. _The test of the correctness 
of an idea is the ability to use and apply it successfully. 
The best test of whether the pupils have correct ideale 
measuring and of square is not their ability to define 
these in words but their ability to measure successfully and 
to recognize squares. Thus the Verification is part of the  
-P-A-G-E-109
  
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IDEAS 103 
Application, in the case of ideas, and the latter step is 
therefore doubly important. As soon as the pupils have 
partially grasped the new idea they must be given many 
and varied opportunities to apply it and by so doing to 
correct their idea and to make it their permanent pos- 
session.

CHAPTER VI 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF FACTS AND PRINCIPLES 
Facts. There are a large number of facts to be pre- 
sented in arithmetic. The simplest of these are the funda- 
mental facts of addition, subtraction, multiplication and 
division—the so-called combinations and tables. Besides 
these, there are other facts or relations such as the fact 
that the circumference of a circle is always a little more 
than three times the diameter, the fact that the volume of 
a cone is just one-third the volume of a cylinder having 
the same base and altitude, the fact that a number is 
divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9 and 
not otherwise, ete. 
Principles. Besides these facts, there are truths of a 
more general and fundamental character, called principles, 
such as the principle that a series of factors may be multi- 
plied in any order without changing the result, and the 
principle that multiplying both terms of a fraction by 
the same number does not change its value. No hard and 
fast distinction can be made between facts and principles 
and it is not necessary to do so. 
Sometimes a general principle is best presented in the 
grades as a rule or set of directions for accomplishing a 
particular task. Thus the general principle that multi- 
plying the denominator of a fraction by any number, 
divides the fraction by that number, instead of being 
presented asa general principle, might be presented as a 
rule for dividing a fraction by an integer,—namely “To 
divide a fraction by an integer multiply the denominator 
by that integer.” This has the advantage of closely con- 
necting the principle and its most important application.

DEVELOPMENT OF FACTS AND PRINCIPLES 105 
AppitTion Facts 
Number of Addition Facts. In addition the pupils 
must know the sum of any two numbers from 0 to 9. In 
all, there are one hundred of these sums. Thirty-six of 
these are reverses such as 83-+-4—7, the reverse of 4+3=7; 
and nineteen more have zero as one of the two addends, 
as 0+0—0, and 0+3=—3. Eliminating these, there are 
forty-five different addition facts remaining, that are 
usually spoken of as the forty-five addition combinations. 
The thirty-six reverses can not, however, be eliminated 
entirely. If the pupils first learn that 3+5=—8 and that 
2+4—6 and later learn that 5+3—8 and 4+2—6, they 
should be led to generalize from these and similar facts 
to the effect that the two addends may be interchanged 
without changing the result. This generalization will save 
them much time in learning new facts for if they know 
that 7+9—16 they also know that 9+-7—16. They will 
then need some drill on the latter fact so that they will 
know the sum instantly without having to stop and men- 
tally interchange the two numbers. The zero combinations 
should also be taught, as they are needed in examples 
such as Ay The idea of adding zero, or nothing, is more 
difficult than the idea of adding one or two, as it involves 
a more general and abstract conception of the addition 
process. The addition facts involving zero, however, once 
understood, are easily remembered so less time need be 
spent drilling on them than on the other facts. It follows 
from the above discussion that there are not forty-five 
but one hundred addition facts to be taught and memor- 
ized. Some of these are much easier than others, and some 
are connected with others in such a way that knowing one 
fact the other fact can easily be obtained and memorized, 
but all of the hundred must be taught and committed to 
memory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
    
106 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Order of Teaching. The order in which the addition 
facts are first presented differs in different schools. Some 
courses of study organize these facts in tables and present 
the tables in order, as follows:

Mee doh @6): Stet $182 HOM ie Ouhs Mi) pL 
These are known as the tables of 1’s, 2’s and 3’s, re- 
spectively. There are similar tables of 4’s, 5’s, 6’s, 7’s, 8’s 
and 9’s. In many schools the combinations having sums 
of 10 or less are taught first, and those having sums greater 
than 10 are postponed until later. If this is done and the 
above organization is followed, the combinations having 
9 8 9 
sums greater than 10, such as 2, 3 and _3 are omitted 
1 12 
from the tables when first presented and taught later when 
the table is being reviewed. 
If the addition facts are taught in tables, as above, each 
table after the first will contain some facts that are the re- 
verses of facts already known. Thus, in the table of 2’s the 
ak 2 
fact 2 occurs, which is the reverse of 1 which occurs in 
3 3
-P-A-G-E-113
  DEVELOPMENT OF FACTS AND PRINCIPLES 107 
as 2 
the table of 1’s; and in the table of 3’s are the facts 3 and 3 
4 5 
3 3 
which are the reverses of the facts 1 and 2 in the tables 
4 5 
of 1’s and 2’s, respectively. The pupils should be led to 
discover and make use of these relations as soon as possible 
so that when they take up a new table they will already 
know part of it but in a different form and will need only 
enough drill to enable them to recognize these facts in 
their new form. 
If this organization is followed, the zero combinations, 
which would logically come first, should be postponed until 
later. One of the most important things that the pupils 
should get from their work with the first addition facts 
is a clear idea of addition. This idea can not be obtained 
as well from a as it can from ; or f , as the last two can 
be worked out objectively and the zero combinations can 
not. Further, as already stated, the addition of zero is a 
more difficult idea to grasp than the addition of one or * 
two. For these reasons the zero combinations should not 
be presented until after the pupils have met enough other “ 
combinations to give them a clear idea of addition. 
Other schools make the sum the basis of the organization, 
teaching, in order, the combinations having sums 2, 3, 4, 5, 
etc., as follows: 
1 ort Chaise 41-4208

In this organization the fact and its reverse are presented 
3 
at the same time, when the pupils learn that 1 they also 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  108 TEACHING ARITHMETIC

learn that 3 . Again the zero combinations should not be 
4 
taught first but introduced later. The idea of adding zero 
once grasped, the zero combination can then be worked out 
5 4-273 6. 0 
with the others, as 1 5 2 4 3 0 6. 
More recently the attempt has been made in some schools 
to teach the facts in the order of their comparative diffi- 
culty. The following table contains all of the hundred 
facts, those in the first row being the easiest, and those in 
the last the most difficult :

This organization is based upon “the difficulty of memor- 
izing” rather than “the difficulty of understanding.” The 
zero combinations are easy to memorize but difficult to 
understand. For this reason, they should not be taught 
first, but should be postponed until after some. of the 
seemingly more difficult facts have been learned.
-P-A-G-E-115
DEVELOPMENT OF FACTS AND PRINCIPLES 109 
As previously stated, all of the hundred facts must be 
taught and memorized and the particular order in which 
they are presented is immaterial unless it is found that 
they can be taught in a certain order in less time and with 
less effort than in any other order. At the present time 
we have no conclusive experimental proof as to which 
is the most economical order and until we do have such 
proof, any discussion of the relative merits of the different 
organizations given above is mere theorizing. 
Miscellaneous Order in Drill. The above discussion has 
to do only with the order in which the facts are first pre- 
sented. As soon as the pupils have met a few facts, the 
order of these facts must be constantly changed in the 
drill work so that each may be learned as a separate fact 
and not as part of a table. No matter what organization 
is used in presenting the facts, it must not be adhered to 
in the drill on these facts. 
Derived Facts. Besides the hundred addition facts dis- 
cussed above, there are other facts derived from these, that 
the pupils must know in order to add columns. In adding 
the column in the margin, starting at the bottom, the 
pupils must know the sum of 7 and 9, of 16/and 5, 
of 21 and 8, and of 29 and 7. The first of these is 
one of the fundamental facts, but in the others the 
pupils must be able to mentally add a two-place 
number (carried in the head) to a one-place number. 
This is known as addition by endings, or carrying 
the fundamental addition facts to higher decades. The 
usual practice, in the past, has been to postpone the teach- 
_ing of these facts until after the hundred fundamental 
combinations have been mastered and until they are needed 
in column addition. At present there is a tendency to 
teach them at the same time as the fundamental facts, 
teaching and drilling on q a , ete., at the same time Jacaor
-P-A-G-E-116
  110 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
as . The claim is made that this procedure results in a 
saving of time. 
Suprraction Facts 
Number of Subtraction Facts. Every addition fact has 
as its inverse a corresponding subtraction fact, so there 
are the same number of fundamental facts in subtraction 
as in addition, namely, one hundred. This number in- 
cludes the nine combinations in which the answer is zero, as 
12 12 
1 2, ete.; the nine in which the subtrahend is zero, as 0 0 
00 a2 
0 
ete.; and also 0 . These nineteen facts are easier than the 
0 
other eighty-one and consequently need not be drilled on 
nearly as much, but can not be neglected entirely. 
Order of Teaching. The usual practice today is to teach 
the inverse subtraction facts at the same time as the cor- 
responding addition facts, teaching together the four facts, 
i on a and a . It is claimed that this results in 
an economy of time, and while we have no exact experi- 
mental proof of this, experience would seem to indicate 
that this claim is true. The order of presenting the sub- 
traction facts, therefore, depends on the order used in 
presenting the addition facts. 
Muutierication Facts 
Number of Multiplication Facts. If the multiplication 
facts are taught to 10X10 there are altogether one hundred 
twenty-one facts. This number includes twenty-one zero com- 
binations, as : : M : , ete.; nineteen other combi-
-P-A-G-E-117
  DEVELOPMENT OF FACTS AND PRINCIPLES 111 
Toil 
nations in which one factor is unity, as 1 1 2, ete.; seven- 
2 
10 2103 teen others in which one factor is ten, as 210 3 10: ete 
and twenty-eight others that are réverses, as 8X7—56, the 
reverse of 7X8—56, ete. This leaves thirty-six combina- 
tions on which to spend most of the time, but the easier 
combinations should not be neglected entirely. If the 
pupils know 7X8=56, they also know 8X7=56, but they 
should be drilled on both facts so that they can give 
either without hesitation. The zero facts must also receive 
some attention; it is a common mistake for high school 
or even college students to say that 0X5=5 or 5X0=5, 
not because they do not know better if they stop to think, 
but simply because these facts have never been memorized 
and made mechanical as have the other facts, such as 
5X 7=85. 
Some schools teach the facts to 1212. The only advan- 
tage in doing this is that it enables the pupils to multiply 
by 11 and 12 in a single multiplication without breaking 
the multiplier into two parts, and to divide by 11 and 
12, using short division instead of long. It is doubtful 
if the time thus saved counterbalances the extra time 
necessary to learn the additional facts, particularly as 
12 and 11 are easy multipliers and divisors anyway, and 
do not occur very frequently. On the other hand, it is 
true that the extra time taken to learn the additional 
combinations is not very great. The present tendency 
seems to be to teach the facts only to 10X10. 
Order of Teaching. The custom has prevailed in the 
past of teaching the multiplication facts in the form of 
tables and teaching the tables in the order of the digits. 
The table of 1’s is first taught, then the 2’s, the 3’s, etc., 
as follows:
-P-A-G-E-118
  
112 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
1X 1=1 2X 1= 2 10X: 1/10 
1X 2— 2 2X 2— 4 10x 2= 20 
1X 3= 3 2X 3= 6 10x 3= 30

1x 9= 9 2X 9=18 10x 9= 90 
1x<10=10 2x<10=20 1010100 
Some schools prefer organizing the tables in this form: 
1x1l=1 1x2= 2 
2x1— 2 2x2— 4 
3x1= 3 3xX2— 6 
* * * * * * ete. 
9x1= 9 9xX2=18 
10X1=10 © 10X2—20 
Most schools teach the table of 2’s first, postponing the 
1's until later, as they do not bring out the multiplication 
idea as well as the 2’s and therefore do not make as good 
an introduction to the multiplication facts. After the 
idea of multiplication is grasped the 1’s will be very easy 
and but little drill need be given on them. As in addition 
and subtraction, the zero combinations should be postponed 
until after the pupils have a clear idea of the meaning of 
multiplication. 
More recently many schools have broken away from these 
traditional orders. Such schools have usually followed 
one of two plans; they have either presented the tables 
in some order other than the regular or 1, 2, 3 order, or 
else have presented the facts as individual facts, not organ- 
ized in tables at all. Where the tables are not presented 
in regular order the attempt has been made to teach 
them in the order of their comparative difficulty. It seems 
to be pretty well agreed that the four easiest tables are 
the 2’s, 4’s, 5’s and 10’s; as to the other tables there is 
a wide difference of opinion. 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  
DEVELOPMENT OF FACTS AND PRINCIPLES 113: 
We have no conclusive experimental proof as to what 
is the most economical order in which to teach the facts 
or as to the comparative difficulty of the different tables 
and facts. Jessup and Coffman* secured the opinions of 
507 superintendents on this question. Their replies are 
presented in the following table: I

That is, of 507 superintendents giving opinions, 37.5% 
believe that the tables should be taught in regular order ; 
25.4% believe they should be taught in the 2, 4, 5, 10 
order; 6.4% believe that the combinations should be 
taught without any reference to order; 7.3% believe that 
the order is of no importance whatever; and 23.4% 
believe that any miscellaneous order will be satisfactory. 
Jessup and Coffman state: “The only conclusion to which 
we can come is that the old order is still the prevailing 
order, and that the prevailing tendency is to try to find 
some other.” : 
Miscellaneous Order in Drill. As stated in discussing 
the order of presenting the addition facts, the order in 
which the facts are first presented is only’a question of 
economy of time, and no matter what organization is fol- 
lowed, as soon as the pupils have acquired a few facts 
they must be drilled upon them in a miscellaneous and 
constantly changing order. If this is not done there is 
danger that the facts will not be learned as individual 
facts but as part of a table. or of some particular organi- 
zation.

  114 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Division Facts 
Number of Division Facts. Since for every multiplica- 
tion fact there is an inverse division fact, one would expect 
to find the same number of division as multiplication facts, 
that is, one hundred twenty-one. This would be true were 
it not for the fact that the inverses of eleven of the multi- 
plication facts take the form 0)0, 0)1, which is indeterminate, 
and eleven others have unity for the divisor, leaving only 
ninety-nine facts to be taught. Of these, nine have zero 
for the dividend, as 2)0, 3)0, ete.; nine have unity for 
the quotient, as 2)2, 3)3, ete.; nine are of the form 2)20, 
3)30, ete.; and nine of the form 10)20, 10)30, ete. 
These thirty-six facts are easier to memorize than the 
remaining sixty-three and so less time need be spent on 
them. 
Derived Facts. Besides the fundamental division facts 
the pupils must know other facts derived from them. In 
the division example 4)276 the pupils must know how 
many 4’s in 27 and what remainder is left. To distinguish 
these derived facts from the fundamental facts the first 
are called the wneven division facts and the last the even 
division facts. All of the facts that the pupils must know 
in division both even and uneven are summarized in the 
following: 
How many 2’s in each number from 2 to 19 and what 
remainder? 
How many 3’s in each number from 3 to 29 and what 
remainder? 
How many 4’s in each number from 4 to 39 and what 
remainder? 
How many 5’s in each number from 5 to 49 and what 
remainder? 
How many 6’s in each number from 6 to 59 and what 
remainder?
-P-A-G-E-121
  
DEVELOPMENT OF FACTS AND PRINCIPLES 115 
How many 7’s in each number from 7 to 69 and what 
remainder? 
How many 8’s in each number from 8 to 79 and what 
remainder? 
How many 9’s in each number from 9 to 89 and what 
remainder? 
Order of Teaching. The present tendency is to teach 
the division facts at the same time as, or shortly after, 
the corresponding multiplication facts, the order of pre- 
senting the division facts being governed by the order used 
in presenting the multiplication facts. When the pupils 
learn 6X8=48, or that six 8’s make 48, they learn the 
answer to the division fact 8)48 which asks “How many 
8’s in 48?” and time is probably saved by teaching and 
drilling on the two facts together. 
Meruops or PresentinG New Facts AND PRINCIPLES 
Inductive Development of Facts. New facts and prin- 
ciples may be presented either inductively or deductively. 
As pointed out in the discussion of Objective Work, the 
first addition, subtraction, multiplication and division facts 
must be presented inductively and objectively. It is not 
necessary or desirable, however, that all the facts in each 
of these series be worked out in this way. To present 
all these facts inductively would take too much time. 
Deductive Development of Facts. After enough facts 
in the series have been worked out inductively so that the 
pupil understands what they mean and can image the 
situation involved, the remaining facts are best obtained 
from those already known, that is by deduction. The 
deductions involved are so easy that the pupils have no 
difficulty in making them. Thus, in addition, the com- 
binations having sums of ten or less might be obtained 
inductively by counting objects. The remaining facts can 
be obtained deductively in a variety of ways. For ex-
-P-A-G-E-122
116 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
ample, the pupils can get 4 from +h , Which is already 
known by adding one to the answer. In subtraction, after 
the first facts have been obtained by counting, the remain- 
ing facts can be obtained from the corresponding addition 
9 
facts. Knowing that -+-7, or that 16 is made up of seven 
16 
16 16 
_ and nine, the pupils can readily reason out —9 and —7. 
7 S 
The later multiplication facts can also be obtained in several 
ways without resorting to the counting of objects. For 
example, 78 can be obtained by adding seven 8’s, or by 
counting by 8’s, or from 68 by adding another 8. Again, 
the pupils should get their first division facts by counting 
objects but after enough division facts have been worked 
out in this way to give them the idea of what division 
facts mean, the remaining facts can be gotten from the 
multiplication facts. Thus from the fact 7<8—56 or 
“Seven 8’s are fifty-six” the pupil can answer the question 
asked by 8)56, namely, “How many 8’s are there in fifty- 
RY 
Tue INpucTIVE DEVELOPMENT oF Facts AND PRINCIPLES 
The inductive development of facts and principles pre. 
sents the same phases as all other inductive thinking. 
The Problem. This preparatory phase of the presenta- 
tion of new material is the same for all kinds of material 
and for both types of thinking so, in what follows, further 
discussion of it will be omitted. 
The Selection of Cases. In this step the teacher should 
present or help the pupils to choose a few very simple cases 
in which the general fact or principle to be discovered 
is as prominent an element as possible. Usually two or  
-P-A-G-E-123
DEVELOPMENT OF FACTS AND PRINCIPLES 117 
three cases are sufficient to enable the pupil to discover 
the relationship. 
Comparison and Abstraction. In examining the cases 
chosen, the question is “What is true in this case?” “In 
this?” “What is true in all of these cases?” The truth or 
fact should be emphasized by having the pupil state it 
each time in terms of the particular situation. Thus the 
pupil works out with the objects themselves and states 
“2 books and 4 books are 6 books” and “2 girls and 4 girls 
are 6 girls,” or, by measuring, discovers and states “The 
square of the hypotenuse of this triangle is equal to the 
sum of the squares of the other two sides.” It is essential 
that the supposed relationship discovered be definitely 
stated by the pupil each time. 
Hypothesis and Verification. The tentative generaliza- 
tion should be made as soon as the pupils see the relation- 
ship involved. After the pupils have counted and found 
that 2 books and 4 books are 6 books and 2 girls and 4 
girls are 6 girls, they are usually ready to conclude that 
2 and 4 are always 6 and they should be permitted to 
do so. To make them go ahead and work out the fact 
with books, girls, boys, erasers, pieces of chalk and so on, 
is a waste of time and may do positive harm. The purpose 
of studying the objective situations is to let the pupils 
discover for themselves that 2 and 4 are always 6, so that 
they will not only be convinced of the truth of the fact 
but also understand the meaning of the words and symbols 
in which the fact is expressed. These purposes are served 
just as soon as the pupils are ready to generalize that. 2 
and 4 are always 6. Once the discovery of the new fact 
is made it is both unnecessary and a waste of time to use 
additional cases before forming a tentative conclusion. To 
multiply situations after that is to cripple the pupils by 
keeping them in the concrete stage of development when 
they are ready to pass to the general, abstract stage.  
-P-A-G-E-124
118 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
In the case of the fundamental facts of addition, sub- 
traction, multiplication and division, the generalization 
made here may well be final, as the facts are so obvious 
that verification is unnecessary. Less obvious facts and 
principles should be verified by examining other cases. 
Thus, after the pupils have found, by filling a hollow cone 
with sand and emptying it into a hollow cylinder having 
the same base and altitude, that this particular cone is 
just one-third of the cylinder, they should verify this rela- 
tionship by using other sets of models of different sizes 
and proportions, the cone always having the same base and 
altitude as the cylinder. 
Final Generalization. The generalization should be 
stated first in words and then, if possible, in mathematical 
symbols. In the illustration previously used, the pupils 
should first state their generalization in words “Two and 
four make six” and then in mathematical symbols 2+4—6. 
Application. As soon as the general fact or principle is 
obtained opportunities should be given the pupils to use 
it in a variety of situations in order to show its signifi- 
cance and to fix it in mind for the time. Whenever pos- 
sible, the application should be to concrete applied problems 
rather than to abstract drill examples. Such concrete 
application not only helps fix the fact or principle in mind 
but also shows its importance; it connects, from the begin- 
ning, the fact or principle with the situation in which it 
is used, which is of the utmost importance if the pupils 
are to be able to use their arithmetic. 
In the case of the fundamental number facts, several 
of which are usually developed in the same recitation, the 
attempt to use the facts in problems will soon convince 
the pupils that they do not know them well enough and 
that they need to memorize them. The need for abstract 
drill being thus established, a little can be given at the 
end of the recitation or it can be postponed until the next
-P-A-G-E-125
  DEVELOPMENT OF FACTS AND PRINCIPLES 119 
day. As an illustration, suppose a class has just devel- 
oped the first part of the multiplication table of 3’s. As 
the results are discovered, they are written down, so that 
at the beginning of the step of application the following 
is on the board: 
2x3=— 6 
3x3= 9 
4x3=12 
5xX38=15 
6xX38=18 
As an application of these facts the pupils might have 
a “Three Cent Store” in which the various articles are all 
marked 3 cents. Each pupil goes to the store and buys 
two or more articles. Thus a pupil might go to the store 
and buy 4 pieces of candy at 3 cents each, paying the 
storekeeper with toy money. To do this the pupil and 
storekeeper must know what 4X<3¢ amounts to and would 
get the answer by looking at the board. After enough 
of this work to make sure that the pupils understand the 
meaning of the facts the advantage of saving time by 
memorizing them should be pointed out. 
Tue DepuctivE DEVELOPMENT OF Facts AND PRINCIPLES 
The deductive development of facts and principles differs 
from the inductive only in the method used for discovering 
the new fact or principle. Instead of leading the pupils to 
discover the new knowledge by studying and comparing 
individual cases, the teacher, by skilful questioning, leads 
them to recall and use old knowledge in such a way as to 
bring out the new. Thus, if the problem is to work out 
7X6, the teacher by questions such as, “Six 6’s are how 
many?” “How many more are seven 6’s?” “What will we 
have to do then to get seven 6's?” and “How many are 
seven 6’s?” will lead the pupil to the conclusion that 
7X6=42.
-P-A-G-E-126

The Problem, Hypothesis and Verification, Final Gen-

as in the inductive methods of development and all that

method applies to the deductive method as well and need

CHAPTER VII 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RULES AND PROCESSES 
Definitions. For some of the simpler processes of arith- 
metic it is possible to formulate brief rules of procedure. 
Such are the rules for multiplying fractions, dividing by 
a fraction, multiplying decimals, ete. Other processes such 
as long division, column addition, etc., are so complicated 
that no simple rule can be stated. To distinguish between 
these the first are called rules and the second processes. 
The Processes Are Complex. The four fundamental 
processes of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divi- 
sion are not simple processes that the pupils can learn all 
at one time, but are very complex and must be presented 
gradually, one step at a time. A mastery of any one of 
them involves the ability to do many different things, 
demands not a single ability but many different abilities 
and habits. It is very important that all of these abilities 
and habits be systematically developed one by one and 
that none be neglected. In order to do this the various 
difficulties and habits involved in the complete process 
must be carefully separated and each must be mastered 
and mechanized before the next is introduced. 
The following analyses show some of the difficulties to 
be mastered, and habits to be formed, in each of the four 
processes. These are arranged approximately in the order 
in which they are met by the pupils, but the exact order 
varies in different texts and schools.

This is the next step after the combinations. The new 
difficulty presented is that of retaining the sum of the first 
two numbers in mind and mentally adding it to the third 
number. This work should start as soon as enough combi- 
nations have been learned and much of the drill on the 
combinations should be obtained from adding columns such 
as these. Some schools prefer to learn the combinations 
entirely through work of this kind, claiming that time is 
saved in this way. Most schools still prefer, however, to 
give some preliminary drill on the combinations. 
III. Addition of two-place numbers without “carrying.” 
34 23 
12) 12

To add these the pupils must learn to break the numbers 
into their parts and to add the units and then the tens. 
This is the first place in which the pupils encounter this 
method of procedure, which is the basis of all of our 
methods of calculating with numbers larger than nine. 
IV. Addition of two-place and one-place numbers with- 
out carrying.

32 20 10 Even if the zero combinations have been drilled upon, 
zeros occurring in column addition usually give some 
trouble and enough examples must be met by the pupils 
to overcome this. Many schools do not give any drill on 
the zero combinations as such but postpone these until 
they are met in column addition. Some schools teach 
20 2 tens : 2 2 units 30 8 tens the same time as 3 OF 3 ynits-

261 2 The only new difficulty involved is learning what to do 
with the two figures obtained in the answer. The habit 
of placing the units figure of the answer immediately below 
the units column should be established from the beginning. 
VII. “Addition by endings,” or “carrying the combina- 
tions to higher decades.” In column addition the pupils 
must be able to add mentally a two-place to a one-place 
number. Counting by 2’s, 3’s, 4’s, ete., beginning with 
1, 2, ete., up to the number by which they are counting, 
is excellent preparation for this work. Much drill must

Most of this drill should be oral and mental. Some schools 
prefer to extend the combinations to higher decades at the 
time they are first learned.

XI. Column addition with more than six addends. 
The new difficulty here arises from the increased at- 
tention span. Experiment shows that most pupils 
can keep their attention fixed on column addition 
for from six to eight additions. Then the attention 
wanders and the pupils if left to their own resources, 
often get completely lost. As a result pupils who 
can add columns of four or six addends successfully 
often fail utterly on longer columns. They must be 
taught to recognize this difficulty, to keep the proper 
place in the column with their pencil, and to remem- 
ber the partial sum, while they let their attention 
wander momentarily and rest for an instant. 
XII. Addition of addends having different number of 
digits. This difficulty is the same as met in adding two- 
place and one-place numbers. The habit of keeping the 
right hand column straight must be thoroughly established.

123 Problems of this type give difficulty particularly if the 
borrowing plan is used, in which the pupils think “Three 
from twelve is 9, two from nine is 7, one from two is 1.” 
The new difficulty comes from the fact that there is a 
cipher in tens place in the minuend so there is nothing to 
borrow from, until ten is borrowed from hundreds place. 
This type of example will give less trouble if the pupils 
use the equal addition plan in which they think “Three 
from twelve is 9, three from ten is 7, two from three is 1.”

If the second figure of the divisor is large (7, 8 or 9), the

more than the first figure of the divisor as the trial divisor 
than when the first figure is used as it stands.

which it is to be subtracted, the pupils must learn to locate

order to see if the partial product is too large.

made one more if the third figure is 7, 8 or 9.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF RULES AND PROCESSES 
Discovery of Tentative Rule or Process. In developing 
a new rule or a new step in some process, the teacher 
should select a simple typical case coming under the rule 
or process to be developed, and lead the pupils to think out 
the result, making use of the knowledge they already have.
-P-A-G-E-138
  132 \ TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
If the course of study is properly organized, the pupils 
will always have sufficient knowledge to enable them to 
think out this example. Thus in working out the rule for 
multiplying decimals, the pupils can make use of their 
knowledge of multiplication of common fractions, or in 
developing the process of long division the pupils can use 
their knowledge of short division to get the results. 
If the method used in getting the result in this one case 
is the same as the method that is to be finally used, or 
makes this method evident, then the next step is to reduce 
the work of getting the answer to its mere essentials. 
Thus, in developing the process of carrying in division, the 
teacher might start with the example 3)75. The pupils 
first think this out as “7 tens divided by 3 gives 2 tens 
and 1 ten over. One ten and 5 units make 15 units. Fif- 
teen units divided by 3 gives 5 units.” From this one 
example the pupils will usually discover what to do with 
the 1 that remains when they divide 7 by 3. If necessary, 
other similar examples may be taken to make the process 
clear. Then the pupils should reduce the process to its 
mere essentials and come to the tentative conclusion that 
all they need to think in solving the above example is 
“3 in 7, 2 and 1 over; 3 in 15, 5.” 
The method used in getting the result in the first 
example is not always the short “working method” but is 
often long and cumbersome. When this is the case, the 
pupils, having obtained the result by the long, thought 
process, should next try to find a short method of getting 
the correct answer. If this short method is not evident 
from the one example the teacher should take others and 
think them through with the pupils in the same way as 
the first. Then the pupils should examine and compare 
the several examples in order to find the short method. 
In developing the rule for multiplying decimals the teacher 
might start with the example .2X.3. This might be worked
-P-A-G-E-139
  
DEVELOPMENT OF RULES AND PROCESSES 133 
out by the pupils by changing the decimals to common 
fractions. Thus .3.4—%0x%0=™oo—.12. The method 
used in this case is too long, so the pupils try to find a 
shorter way of getting the answer. To aid them in this, 
the teacher takes other examples, such as .2X.03 and 
.05X.07, and the pupils work these as before by changing 
to common fractions. The teacher than writes the three 
examples and the answers on the board as follows: 
3X4 =12 
2 X.03=.006 
05 X .07==.0035 
By comparing these the pupils discover that 12 is just 
3x4, 6 is 2X3, and 35 is 5X7, and that the number of 
decimal places in the answer is equal to the number in 
the multiplier and multiplicand together, and formulate 
the tentative rule: “To multiply decimals, multiply as 
whole numbers and point off as many decimal places in 
the product as there are in the multiplier and multipli- 
cand together.” 
Verification. The tentative method of procedure thus 
discovered, whether by thinking through one example or 
comparing: several, should then be verified. This can be 
done by applying the short method to more examples and 
checking the results obtained, or by thinking through 
more examples in the same way as the first and also solving 
them by the short method to see if the results correspond. 
Thus the validity of the tentative process of carrying in 
division might be verified by taking other examples, such 
as 2)34, 4)92, ete., working them by the short process and 
checking the results obtained by multiplication. The tenta- 
tive rule for multiplying decimals could be verified by 
working other examples in the same way as the first, namely, 
by changing to common fractions, and then working them 
by the short method to see if it gives the correct result.  
-P-A-G-E-140
  134 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Final Generalization. If the generalization is a rule, 
having once been made, it must be memorized for future 
use. It is better to have the pupils and teacher first agree 
on a form of statement and then have it memorized in- 
that exact form. If the pupils are permitted to state 
the generalization each time in their own way it will lead 
to inaccurate statements and mistakes, besides wasting 
time. The exact form of the statement memorized is im- 
portant, as it is to be used many times in the future and 
so must be stated in a convenient form. A rule is a set 
of working directions for performing a particular kind 
of task. As such, it must be brief, intelligible and spe- 
cific. Thus, in stating the rule for multiplying a number 
by 12% it is better to state it in the form, “To multiply 
a number by 12% annex two ciphers and divide by 8,” than 
in the form, “To multiply a number by 12%, first multi- 
ply it by 100 and then divide by 8.” Further, the 
statement of the rule should always embody a descrip- 
tion of the task to be accomplished, as well as direc- 
tions for accomplishing it, in order to connect or asso- 
ciate in the pupils’ minds the task on the one hand 
with the method of performing it on the other. Having 
worked out the rule for multiplying decimals it is not 
sufficient to formulate and memorize it in the form, “Point 
off as many decimal places in the product as in the multi- 
plier and multiplicand together,” as some text books do; 
but rather it should be stated and memorized in the form, 
“To multiply decimals multiply as whole numbers and 
point off in the product as many decimal places as there 
are in the multiplier and multiplicand together.” Every 
rule should be stated and learned in the form, “To perform 
such and such a task, proceed as follows.” 
In developing a process the generalization is a brief 
summary of the essential steps to be taken in performing 
the process. Before leaving this phase of the develop-  
-P-A-G-E-141
  
aes. ~DEVELOPMENT OF RULES AND PROCESSES 135 rae 
ment and starting the application, the teacher should help 
the pupils to standardize the method of procedure and the 
words used in thinking through the process, and both of 
these should be reduced to an absolute minimum. 
Application. The pupils should be practised according 
to the short, final method only and should never be prac- 
_ticed or drilled on the long thought forms. The sole pur- 
2,,,/pose of thinking through a few examples is to discover the 
| Ron method, and once discovered it should be used from 
  that time on. To permit the pupils to use the long thought / 
hk C] | form after the short form has been discovered, is to estab- 
\“\C | lish a habit that is very difficult to break and which, if 
~~~ not broken, will be a serious handicap to the pupils’ future 
success in arithmetic. 
It is particularly important in developing rules and 
processes that the first applications be closely supervised 
by the teacher so as to prevent the pupils practicing on 
an incorrect method of procedure. A little care in the 
beginning may prevent mistakes which, if permitted to 
become habitual, will be very difficult to correct. 
In the case of rules and processes it is usually neces- 
sary to make the first application to abstract drill examples 
rather than to applied problems. The pupils need to 
concentrate their whole attention on the carrying out of 
the rule or process and not have it distracted by the added 
difficulty of thinking out an applied problem. Thus, hav- 
ing formulated the rule for dividing by a fraction, the 
first application should be to abstract drill examples, such 
as 21+%4, %+%, ete. The only thing the pupils have to 
think about here is how to apply the new rule. Having 
mastered the mechanics of the rule or process, it should 
then be used. in concrete, applied problems in order to 
show the pupils its practical intggrtance and to associate 
the rule with the kind of life situationgin which it is to 
be used. ~

CHAPTER I 
METHODS OF FIXING—LAWS OF HABIT 
FORMATION 
In the previous section the problem of how best to 
present new knowledge to the pupils has been discussed. 
In arithmetic this type of teaching occupies a compara- 
tively small portion of the time devoted to the subject. 
The fact, principle, rule, or process once presented must 
be retained and made a part of the pUpils’ permanent 
mental equipment. It is not enough that the pupils under- 
stand and can use the process of long division the day 
it is first presented; they must in some way be made to 
retain this knowledge.permanently so that they can use the 
process next year or any time in the future that the need 
for it may arise. Further, the process must be made 
automatic, mechanical; it is not enough that the pupils 
can perform the process of long division if they have 
time to think it through step by step, they must be able 
to perform it mechanically without stopping to think, 
Arithmetic has been called a habit-forming subject and 
habit formation is one of its most prominent and impor-

of teaching by which this is done is one of the most promi- 
nent and important types that occurs in the teaching of 
arithmetic. 
Two Meruops or Frxing AnD MECHANIZING 
Fixing by Formal Repetition. After a new bit of arith- 
metical knowledge has been gained it may be fixed in 
mind in either of two ways, by formal repetition or by 
use. The first method, that of formal repetition, was 
formerly employed almost exclusively. The pupils were 
given the new knowledge, say a multiplication table, and 
then they were required to repeat it over and over again 
in a formal, abstract way until it was memorized and mech- 
anized. Only then were they permitted to meet and use 
these facts in a concrete setting. 
Fixing by Use. In recent years there has been a reac- 
tion against this mechanical, formal, abstract type of drill. 
It is usually attacked on the ground that it is uninteresting 
and deadening in its effects on the pupils, and bea 
unnecessary and therefore wasteful of time. Those who 
take this point of view argue that as soon as the pupils 
acquire new information, such as a new set of facts, they 
should at once meet and use these facts in concrete situa- 
tions or problems and that through frequent use they will 
eventually be memorized and mechanized. As an illus- 
tration of these two methods, suppose a class has just 
worked out a new set of multiplication facts. The teacher 
might then have them study and repeat the facts abstractly 
until memorized, and then use them in concrete problems. 
Or, as each fact is worked out, it might be written on the 
board (as 7X8=56) and then the pupils could work 
concrete problems involving these facts, getting the answers 
from the board. If the pupils work enough such prob- 
lems the supposition is that the facts will ultimately be 
nomen and mechanized without any abstmact repetition. 
a

  138 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Comparison of the Two Methods. Each of these ex- 
treme methods has certain advantages and disadvantages. 
Formal repetition affords the maximum number of repeti- 
tions per pupil per minute and centers the attention on 
the abstract fact or process being repeated, and so it will 
undoubtedly fix and mechanize in the shortest possible 
time. There is the disadvantage, however, that the new 
fact or process is memorized abstractly and entirely un- 
connected with the concrete situation in which it is to 
be used later. The result, very often, is that the pupils 
know how to add but do not know when to add, that the 
pupils know how to divide but can not recognize a concrete 
division situation or problem. 
On the other hand fixing by use alone has the dis- 
advantage that it provides comparatively few repetitions 
per pupil per minute and centers the attention on the 
concrete situation rather than on the number relation 
or process being repeated, consequently it takes a long 
time to fix and mechanize anything by this method alone. 
Indeed, when one stops to consider the large number of 
facts, principles, rules and processes that must be mechan- 
ized, it becomes extremely doubtful if the pupils could 
possibly solve enough concrete problems to fix and mechan- 
ize all of them. It must be recognized, however, that fixing 
through use has the advantage that the facts, processes, 
ete., are learned and memorized in direct connection with 
the concrete situations in which they are used. As a 
result the pupils not only learn the fact or process, but 
at the same time form a mental connection between the 
fact or process and the corresponding concrete situation; 
the pupils not only learn how to subtract but at the same 
time unconsciously become familiar with the kind of prob- 
lems that are to be solved by this process of subtraction. 
Combination of Two Methods. Since success in life de- 
mands both an automatic control of the fundamentals and
-P-A-G-E-145
  
LAWS OF HABIT 139 
the ability to use them in concrete situations, it follows 
that neither repetition nor use alone is sufficient. -One 
extreme is as bad as the other. Much use is necessary 
from the very beginning, and this use not only develops 
the ability to apply arithmetic but also, to a larger extent 
than one is apt to think, serves to fix and mechanize the 
fundamentals. To insure this mechanization in the time 
at our disposal, use must be supplemented by a certain 
amount of abstract repetition. This repetition, although 
abstract, need not be monotonous and uninteresting in the 
hands of a skilful teacher. In fact, by the use of games, 
contests, time limit, standards, ete., it can be made intensely 
interesting. The term drill will be used in the rest of this 
book to mean the abstract repetition of a fact, rule or 
process in order to fix and mechanize, but repetition made 
interesting by the use of games, contests, ete. 
Time Spent on Drill. A few ultra-modern schools have 
made the mistake of giving too little time to drill, but 
the majority of schools at the present time are probably 
spending too large a proportion of time on drill and too 
small a proportion on the applications of arithmetic. 
Teachers and superintendents lose sight of the fact that 
less abstract repetition will be needed if more concrete 
problem solving is done. : 
We have no experimental data to indicate what part of 
* the time in each grade should be devoted to drill. Jessup 
and Coffman* obtained the opinions of 564 school super- 
intendents on this question. The mediant per cent of 
recitation time favored for strictly drill work by these 
superintendents was as follows:

140 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Until we have positive experimental proof as to what 
constitutes the most advantageous distribution of time be- 
tween drill and application, these figures probably afford 
the best available guide. The author is inclined to believe, 
however, that with proper methods of drill the time sug- 
gested for purely drill work by these superintendents, 
ean be materially reduced. 
Laws or Hasir Formation 
To say that the fundamental facts and processes of arith- 
metic must be fixed and mechanized is only another way 
of stating that the reactions involved in these facts and 
processes must be made habitual, that a set of specific 
habits must be formed. The laws of habit formation have 
been quite definitely established, and although different 
authors have stated them in different ways, in their essen- 
tials they are the same. 
Repetition. It has already been stated that the chief 
method of habituating the facts and processes of arith- 
metic is repetition either in abstract form or in connection 
with concrete problems. Without repetition no habit is 
possible and it is the duty of the teacher to provide the 
pupils with enough opportunities for repeating the funda- 
mental facts and processes of arithmetic to reduce them 
to habits. 
Attention. A second factor in habit formation is atten- 
tion. It is possible to form habits by repetition without 
attention, but it is a very long and wasteful process. The 
number of repetitions necessary to fix a habit can be greatly 
reduced if the repetitions are accompanied by a high degree 
of attention. The securing and keeping of the pupils’ 
attention is one of the chief duties of the teacher in drill 
work. It is not repetition alone that counts, but repetition 
with attention. 
Permit No Exceptions. In forming a habit it is very
-P-A-G-E-147
  
LAWS OF HABIT 141 
important to permit no exceptions to occur. If one is try- 
ing to form the habit of getting up early in the morning 
and does so for five mornings but on the sixth remains in 
bed until 10 o’clock, the desired habit is no nearer formed 
than before he began. It is not safe to permit exceptions 
to a habit while it is being formed. In arithmetic, if the 
teacher wants to establish the habit of responding 8 to 
the situation 6-+2, she must see to it that the pupils never 
respond to this situation by 7 or 9 or anything else except 
8. If she wants to thoroughly establish the desired correct 
habit of procedure in “borrowing” in subtraction she must 
never permit the pupils to proceed in any other than the 
desired way. 
Summary. The two most important duties of the 
teacher in drill work are: (1) To provide for repetition 
with attention; and (2) to prevent the occurrence of 
exceptions to the desired habits. These will be discussed 
in detail in the next two chapters.
-P-A-G-E-148
CHAPTER II 
METHODS OF SECURING AND KEEPING ATTEN- 
TION IN DRILL 
The Attention Naturally Wanders. The mind is so con- 
stituted that the attention can be kept fixed on any given 
thing for only a comparatively short period of time. The 
natural tendency is for the attention to wander and fluctu- 
ate. At a given instant a thousand and one different 
sense stimuli, ideas, and thoughts are clamoring for pos- 
session of the pupils’ minds and constantly tending to 
divert attention from the thoughts already there. The 
pupils can not prevent this and can not help being inat- 
tentive. In fact, there is no such thing as inattention; 
the mind is always focused on something, and what we 
call inattention is really attention to the wrong thing, to 
thoughts of going fishing instead of to 3xX4=—12, or to 
thoughts of a new dress instead of to 7X4—28. The 
teacher must expect the pupils’ attention to fluctuate and 
must provide means of recalling it as soon as it wanders 
away. 
The most important methods of securing and retaining 
the pupils’ attention to drill work are: (1) The proper 
attitude and example of the teacher; (2) Proper motiva- 
tion of the work; (3) Variation of procedure; (4) Use of 
a time limit; (5) Appeal to emulation, and (6) Short drill 
periods. 
THE ATTITUDE AND EXAMPLE OF THE TEACHER 
Dr. Strayer* says, “The greatest single reason for lack 
of interest and attention on the part of the class is found 
  
*Strayer, G. D—A Brief Course in the Teaching Process. 
142
-P-A-G-E-149
  
ATTENTION IN DRILL 143 
in the indifference and lack of energy of the teacher.” 
This statement is not too strong. All of the devices ever 
used or thought of will not succeed in arousing the pupils’ 
interest unless the teacher herself is interested and shows 
it, and without the pupils’ interest the teacher can not 
get a very high degree of attention. If a teacher wants 
her class to be interested, to pay attention, and to put 
all of their energy in the work, she must be interested 
herself and give the work all her attention and energy. 
Tue Mortvation or Dritu 
Definition. It has already been stated that abstract 
drill should be given only when needed. It is not enough, 
however, for the teacher to realize the need; she must make 
the pupils realize it also. Results obtained from drill 
depend not only upon repetition but also upon the degree 
of attention and the amount of energy given to the repeti- 
tions. If the pupils are convinced that they need drill on 
certain fundamentals they will give better attention and 
more energy to the repetitions, and as a consequence get 
the same results in less time or better results in the same 
time than they would if they simply drilled because they 
were told to drill. The teacher’s first task in drill is to 
convince the pupils, if possible, that they need the drill. 
If the teacher drills only when she is convinced that drill 
is necessary, this should not usually be a very difficult task ; 
it is simply a case of taking the pupils into her confidence 
and letting them see why she thinks they should drill. 
Ways of Motivating Drill, There are several ways in 
which the need for drill may appear, and consequently 
several ways of motivating drill: The drill may be needed 
to enable the pupils to (a) solve applied problems, (b) 
master some fundamental process, (c) play some game, or 
(d) improve score, or reach the standard. 
It is not sufficient to tell the pupils that they need drill 
Vey 
Nha \v oN    
-P-A-G-E-150
  144 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
to solve problems or to play a game; they must be shown. 
The work must be so organized that the need for drill 
arises naturally from the pupils’ daily work. Having 
obtained new knowledge, the pupils should immediately 
use it in problems and in games, and this attempt to use 
the fundamentals soon makes the need of practice on 
them evident to both the teacher and pupils. 
Drill Needed to Solve Problems. As already stated, the 
fundamental, basic motive for all of the work in arithmetic 
is to be found in its practical applications. These practical 
applications, brought into the school as problems, form the 
connecting link between the arithmetic of the school room 
and the arithmetic of life and should constitute the back- 
bone of the course. When new arithmetical knowledge 
is acquired it should immediately be used in problems, 
and whenever the pupils see that they are handicapped 
in the problem work by not knowing the fundamentals 
well enough, time should be taken from the applied work 
for abstract drill, returning to problem solving as soon 
as the drill has served its purpose. 
In some cases the cycle from use through drill and 
back to use may be completed in a single recitation. 
More often, perhaps, it will cover several recitations; in 
solving problems one day the need for drill becomes evi- 
dent, so the next day, or perhaps for several days, the time 
is devoted to drill, returning finally to the applied work. 
The teacher should never lose sight of the fact that the 
concrete applications of arithmetic are the reason for 
its being and consequently should be made the unifying 
element of the course, the drill coming only as it is needed 
to facilitate the application of the fundamentals to con- 
crete situations. The problem motive should be emphasized 
from the first grade on. Thus, in the first grade, having 
discovered certain addition facts, the pupils “play store.” 
Each pupil goes to the store and buys two articles, and
-P-A-G-E-151
  
ATTENTION IN DRILL 145 
to find the total cost looks up the fact where it was written 
on the board when first discovered. The pupils are soon 
convinced that they need to memorize these facts because 
if they went to a real store the facts would not be writ- 
ten on the board. After the facts are partially mem- 
orized, if the pupils have trouble in finding the cost of 
two articles, they again see the need for more drill. In 
the eighth grade, high school, college or university, if 
the student gets into trouble in solving problems because 
he makes mistakes in division he should be helped to locate 
the difficulty and encouraged to overcome it by practice. 
The pupils are never too young or too old for the problem 
motive. It is the fundamental motive for all of the work 
in arithmetic. 
Drill Needed on Details in Order to Master Some 
Process. The need for drill does not always arise directly 
from problem solving. For example, the pupils need drill 
on adding one-place numbers to two-place so that they can 
perform such additions mentally and mechanically with- 
out having to stop and think. The situation os must bring 
the reaction 35 just as the situation , brings the reaction 
15. This need does not grow directly out of problem work. 
If the situation 27-+8 arose in a concrete problem the 
pupils would not need to know the result instantly, but 
would have plenty of time to think 8+7=—15, 
1+2=3. But in adding a column such as the one 
in the margin, the pupils must know instantly 
6+7=13, 13+5=—18, 18+9=—27, and 27+8=35. 
The first addition involves only a knowledge of one 
of the primary addition facts, but in eack of the 
others the pupils must know instantly the sum of 
a two-place and a one-place number. So the best way to 
motivate such drill is to show the pupils that this ability Jaa aoa  
-P-A-G-E-152
  146 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
is necessary to the mastery of the fundamental process of 
column addition. 
Even here the ultimate motive is the problem, as drill 
on the mental addition of two-place and one-place numbers 
is necessary in order to master column addition, and a 
mastery of column addition is necessary in solving prob- 
lems. The immediate need and consequently the most effee- 
tive motive lies, however, in the process of column addition. 
This type of motive is very useful in the intermediate 
and upper grades. If the pupils can not. add, subtract, 
multiply or divide successfully it means that they have 
failed to master the facts or some one of the many abilities 
and habits necessary to the successful performance of these 
processes. The teacher must help them to locate the 
difficulty and encourage them to overcome it by practice.* 
Drill Needed to Play Games. The game motive is par- 
ticularly useful in the lower grades, although it should 
not be used to the exclusion of the problem motive. Even 
first grade pupils should know that they need to know 
2+-2 in real life as well as in games. In the intermediate 
and upper grades this motive can be used effectively in 
connection with the races and contests described in Chap- 
ter VI, Part III. If the pupils are interested in a game 
and find that they can not succeed at that game because 
they do not know the fundamental facts and processes 
well enough, they will willingly take the necessary drill. 
In the lower grades the game motive is really funda- 
mentally the same as the problem motive, as the games are 
real life situations to the pupils and situations of the 
greatest and most compelling interest. 
Drill Needed to Improve Score or Reach Standard. If 
the drill work is carried out in such a way that the pupils 
can keep their scores on a given kind of work from day   
*For a list of the abilities and habits necessary to a mastery of the 
fundamental processes see Chapter 7, Part II.
-P-A-G-E-153
  
ATTENTION IN DRILL 147 
to day they can be interested in trying to improve their 
scores. For example, third grade pupils in drilling on 
the addition combinations might be supplied with a sheet 
containing the combinations and be given one minute to 
write answers. At the end of the time the pupils correct 
their papers and record their scores. The teacher then tells 
them that they will try the same test again in a few days 
and that in the meantime they will drill on the combina- 
tions so they can make higher scores. 
If the teacher can tell the pupils how much they should 
be able to do in the given time the motive is still more 
effective. Thus third grade pupils should, by the end of 
the year, be able to write the answers to 26 addition 
combinations in one minute. The setting up of a defi- 
nite standard to be reached is one of the most effective 
motives with the average pupil. On the other hand, weak 
pupils who can never hope to reach the standard should 
not be discouraged by emphasizing the standard score too 
much. In their case the emphasis should be on improving 
their score, and this is an effective motive, as even the 
weakest pupil can improve. Standard tests are described 
and standard scores given in Chapter VII, Part III. 
‘VARIATION IN MernHop or Driniine 
One of the strongest inborn tendencies in attention is 
to attend to the moving, the changing, rather than to the 
fixed and unchanging. The skilful teacher takes advan- 
tage of this inborn tendency to recall the pupils’ attention 
when it starts to wander. She may not want to change 
the subject matter drilled upon, but she can change the 
method of drill. It should be remembered that the change 
of method is not made for the sake of the change, as 
long as a given method serves to hold the pupils’ attention 
there is nothing gained by changing, but as soon as it 
fails to hold attention it should be dropped and another 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  148 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
method substituted. The wise teacher will never start a 
drill period without several drill devices prepared to use 
if needed. Fortunately there is no lack of variety in the 
methods of drill available. The work may be individual 
or group, written or oral, at blackboard or seat, and many 
variations and combinations of these types are possible. 
Further variety may be introduced by the use of games, 
contests, time limit, standard drill cards, ete. 
Use oF A Time Liutr 
One of the most effective methods of holding attention 
in drill is the imposing of a time limit. The drill may 
be either oral or written, but in either case the pupils are 
given a definite time and try to see how much they can 
do in that time. Limiting the time in drill has many 
advantages, one of the most important being that it forces 
the pupils to center their attention on the work in order 
to accomplish as much as possible in the given time. It 
thus provides brief periods of highly concentrated effort 
and attention, and that is what counts in drill. 
EMULATION—GAMES AND CONTESTS | 
Any drill device that appeals to the pupil’s inborn desire 
to do better today than yesterday, to do as well as the 
other pupils in the class, or to have his class do as well 
as other classes, will be useful in holding attention and 
calling forth the pupil’s best efforts. For a full discus- 
sion of the use of games in arithmetic, see Chapter VI, 
part 0: 
SHort, Snappy Dritt Periops 
The best of motives, the most enthusiastic and skilful of 
teachers, and the most interesting of drill devices will all 
fail to hold attention if the drill period is too long. Al- 
though the most effective length of drill period is not
-P-A-G-E-155
  
ATTENTION IN DRILL 149 
known, it has been shown* that a brief period produces 
better results than a long one. Probably drill periods of 
from one to ten or fifteen minutes are best, the exact time 
depending upon the grade, the subject matter, the class, 
the teacher, ete. A drill period is not too long as long 
as the teacher can keep up the attention, interest, and zeal 
of the pupils. When these are lost, further drill is a waste 
of effort at the best and may do positive harm.

HOW TO PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE. OF EX- 
CEPTIONS TO THE DESIRED HABITS 
Be Sure the Pupils Understand the Exact Character 
of: the Desired Habit Before Beginning Repetitions. 
Much depends on getting a correct start in drill work. 
The old saying “First impressions are the strongest” is 
psychologically sound. Pefore asking the pupils to repeat 
a fact or process it is essential that the teacher make clear 
to the pupils exactly what it is that they are to repeat) 
in order to insure the correctness of the first repetitions. 
In presenting the process of carrying in addition the 
first example, as a might be worked out by the pupils 
by representing the two numbers on the top of the teacher’s 
desk by means of sticks. Thus they would represent 28 by 
two bundles of ten each and eight single sticks and under 
it 17 by one bundle of ten sticks and seven single sticks. 
The seven sticks and the eight sticks make fifteen, which 
they would represent by fifteen sticks below the other two 
numbers. Then one ten and two tens make three tens, 
which they would represent by 3 bundles of ten under the 
other tens. They would then have on the desk the fol-

aun 
BB tu wnt  
-P-A-G-E-157
EXCEPTIONS TO DESIRED HABITS’ 15. 
The question would then arise as to what they might 
do with the 15 single sticks, namely, make a bundle of 
ten and put it with the other tens, giving the result 
fi (Ut 
or 4 tens and 5 units, or 45. The teacher would then ask 
the pupils if they could add these numbers on the black- 
board without using the sticks, and they would do so 
under her guidance thinking “7 units and 8 units make 
15 units, but 15 units is 1 ten and 5 units, so we have 5 
in units place. One ten and 1 ten are 2 tens and 2 more 
tens make 4 tens.” The teacher next asks what they really 
need to think in adding the two numbers, bringing out that 
all that is necessary is to think “7 and 8 are 15 (writing 
the 5 and remembering the 1) ; 1 and 1 are 2; 2 and 2 are 
4, (writing the 4).” Several examples should then be 
worked in this way, the teacher doing the work at the 
board until the pupils understand perfectly the exact form 
of procedure that they are to repeat. 
Supervise All Drill Closely Until Habit Is Estab- 
lished. Even after the pupils understand what they 
are to repeat, mistakes are sure to occur which if not 
detected and corrected at once may persist and become 
so fixed as to make the establishment of the correct habit 
very difficult or even impossible. (Until the habit is firmly 
established all drill must be done under the close super- 
vision of the —— in such a way that mistakes can 
be detected as soon/as they are made. Only then is it 
safe to let the pupils drill alone or by methods that can 
not be closely supervised. In the development of carry- 
ing in addition described above, after the teacher is sure 
the pupils understand exactly what they are to repeat, 
the first drill should be individual and oral so that the

:_—~ teacher can tell just what the pupil is thinking as well as 
what he is writing. The author recently saw a recitation 
on the development of carrying in division. Under the 
guidance of the teacher the pupils thought out several 
examples such as 2)38 and 3)72, and at the end of the 
recitation seemed to understand the process, but had not 
determined just what they should think and write, and 
had had no opportunity to work examples for themselves. 
The teacher assigned a list of ten examples in the text to 
be worked for the next day, and then wondered why the 
pupils made so many mistakes. The author saw one paper 
on which the pupil had added the one to be carried to 
the next figure in all ten examples. The teacher’s mis- 
take here was two-fold. She not only started drilling 
before the pupils knew the form to be repeated, but in a 
way that made it impossible for her to detect mistakes until 
after they had been repeated over and over again. She 
not only had not started forming the correct habit but 
had permitted a wrong habit to start which had to be 
broken before the correct habit could be established. By 
having the pupils work individually at their seats or at 
the blackboard under her close supervision the teacher 
should have made sure that each and every pupil not only 
understood the process but could carry it out successfully 
and had worked enough examples to fix the process in 
mind temporarily, and then for several days the drill 
should have been entirely in class under the close super- 
vision of the teacher. Then and then only would it have 
yeen safe to assign examples for independent drill. 
<1. Make Sure by Review and Study that the Pupils Have 
the Desired Facts or Process in Mind TODAY Before 
Starting Repetitions. Teachers too often forget that what 
the pupils knew and could do yesterday and what they 
know and can do today may be two entirely different 
things. At the time of the last drill recitation the pupils 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  
EXCEPTIONS TO DESIRED HABITS 153 
may have had the facts or the process clearly in mind, 
but unless sufficient drill has already been given to estab- 
lish the habit temporarily they may not have them in 
mind today. Nothing is gained by taking chances, the 
teacher should make sure that the pupils know the facts 
and that they understand and can perform the process 
today before asking them to drill. To do otherwise is to 
invite exceptions to the response that one is trying to 
habituate—to lay the basis for future trouble and mistakes. 
The author recently saw a recitation in which the teacher 
got into trouble by starting drill too soon. It was a drill 
recitation in the third grade on the multiplication table 
of .7’s. This table had been developed and drilled upon 
the day before and at the end of the recitation the pupils 
knew the new facts as well as could be expected. Nothing 
had been done with these facts since the previous day. 
The teacher started the new recitation by calling on a pupil 
to repeat the table from memory. Several pupils were 
called on before the table was finally given correctly and 
in the meantime by actual count seven different mistakes 
had been made and one mistake had been repeated three 
times. Such errors are far more serious than we are apt 
to think, as they blaze the way, as it were, for future 
mistakes. This teacher had no one to blame but herself 
for this situation. The fact that the pupils could repeat 
the table at the end of the previous recitation is no evi- 
dence that they can do so today. It is far better to pre- 
vent incorrect responses than to try to correct them after 
they have been made. This teacher could have done this 
by having the pupils study the table for a few minuteés 
at the beginning of the recitation, or before the recitation 
period began. Then she could have called for the facts 
from memory with reasonable certaimty that they would 
be given correctly. No matter how careful a teacher may 
be the pupils will occasionally make incorrect responses, 
;
-P-A-G-E-160
154 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
but this is no excuse for teaching in a way that invites 
such errors. 
‘ Be Sure the Pupils Understand What They Are Doing. 
Although the pupils should always perform the funda- 
mental processes mechanically, they should understand 
what they are doing. In the example 3)84 they should 
always think 3 in 8, 2 and 2 over; 3 in 24, 8; but at the 
same time they should understand what they are really 
doing when they “carry” the 2. The understanding of 
the process prevents many mistakes while the habit is in 
its formative stage. In the above example, if the pupil 
understands what he is really doing he is not apt to make 
the common mistake of adding the figure carried to the 
next place and thinking 3 into 8 goes 2 times and 2 over; 
3 into 6 goes 2 times. (Understanding of the process is 
one of the most valuable means of preventing the forma- 
tion of incorrect habits of response in the fundamental 
processes.} To teach a fact or process without letting the 
_ pupils.sée what they are really doing is just as bad as to 
let the pupil think it through every time. Both lead to 
future mistakes. 
< Be Sure Old Habits Are Well Established Before 
Introducing New. Many exceptions to the desired habits 
result from trying to go too fast, crowding one thing too 
closely on the heels of another, and introducing new facts 
or processes before the old ones are sufficiently mastered. 
As a result, the pupils become confused and make many 
mistakes. No better advice can be given to a teacher of 
arithmetic than “Make haste slowly.” 
\ Do Not Try to Form too Many Habits at One Time. 
‘The secret of success in habit formation is concentration 
on a few specific habits at a time. To try to habituate too 
much at one time leads to confusion, distraction of atten- 
tion and dissipation of energy. In drilling on the funda- 
mental facts only a few should be drilled upon at a time 
é 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
EXCEPTIONS TO DESIRED HABITS 155 
until they are well established, then, when the object of 
further drill is simply to make the responses permanent 
and more rapid, it is safe to drill on a larger number of 
facts together. In formimg habits in the fundamental 
processes attention and drill should be concentrated on 
a few points at a time and other difficulties left out until 
these are mastered and habituated. Thus the process of 
short division without carrying should be drilled on and 
mechanized before carrying is introduced. 
< Do Not Try for Speed Too Soon. While there is no ° 
conflict between accuracy and a reasonable degree of 
speed and one does not necessarily sacrifice accuracy to 
attain speed, yet the fact remains that if the teacher tries 
to speed up the pupils too soon accuracy is bound to 
suffer. Eventually a reasonable degree of speed is just as 
important as a high degree of accuracy, but in drilling 
upon a new set of facts or on a new step in some process 
absolute accuracy is for the time not only the most impor- 
tant but the only end sought. After the new habit is fairly 
_Well established the reaction can be gradually speeded up 
~ without loss of accuracy, but€o strive for speed too soon or 
to try to increase the speed t6o rapidly is sure to result in 
a_loss of accurac; 
Be Sure Work Is Not Too Difficult for Pupils. Very 
similar to the mistake of confusing the pupils by going 
too fast is that of failing to grade the work carefully. 
if the work is properly graded there should be a gradual 
if increase in difficulty) Poor gradation often results in big 
‘\ jumps and the increase in difficulty is so sudden and 
great as to confuse_the weaker or perhaps all of the pupils 
Many mistakes result from giving work that is too difficult 
either for the class as a whole or for individual pupils. 
Not only should the work be carefully graded for the class 
as a whole, but it should also be suited in point of difficulty 
to the individual pupils. We no longer think that the only
-P-A-G-E-162
  156 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
fair way is to treat all alike, but rather that thy only 
fair way is to treat each according to his capabilities and 
needs. Some pupils will need more drill on a given bit 
of subject matter than others and must get it in some 
way. To give all the same amount is to give the better 
pupils too much, and the poorer ones too little. The effect 
on one is just as bad as on the others. The better pupils 
ean be excused from part of the drill and devote the time 
to problem solving, while the weaker pupils must be given 
extra drill. One of the greatest advantages of devices 
such as the Courtis and Studebaker Practice Tests de- 
scribed in Chapter VII, Part III, is that they provide for 
individual differences and give each pupil the amount of 
drill on a given topic that he needs. 
Do Not Form Habits that Must be Broken Later. Do 
Not Attempt to Change a Habit Already Established Un- 
less it is Positively Harmful. A habit once formed should 
never be changed unless it is failing to accomplish its pur- 
pose. If a pupil has formed the habit of subtracting by 
the take away method he should not be forced to change 
to the addition method. / To attempt to break one habit 
of procedure and substitute another habit for it, is always 
to run the risk that neither habit will become fully estab- 
lished. \The teacher is justified in trying to substitute a 
new method for an old, only when the old method is not 
working satisfactorily. This is evidence, usually, either 
that the habits involved have not been fully established, or 
that pernicious habits have been formed that render suc- 
cess with that method impossible. Then, often the best 
thing to do is to drop the old method and start over again 
at the beginning with the new, being careful to establish 
the proper habits and prevent harmful ones. Suppose in 
the seventh grade pupils are dividing decimals, using the 
method by which the decimal point in the quotient is placed 
over the point in the dividend. If a new pupil joins the
-P-A-G-E-163
EXCEPTIONS TO DESIRED HABITS 157 
class and uses the method of counting the number of deci- 
mal places in the dividend and divisor and subtracting 
to get the number in the quotient, he should be permitted 
to continue using this method, providing it works. If he 
can not locate the decimal point in the quotient correctly, 
then the teacher would be justified in teaching him the 
other method. 
If it is harmful to try to break old habits and establish 
new ones in their places it follows that we should avoid 
forming habits that will have to be broken later. Many 
teachers unconsciously permit pupils in the primary grades 
to form the habit of counting on their fingers instead of 
depending on their memory for the number facts. The 
pupils should discover some of the facts by counting, but 
after having discovered them the teacher must convince 
the pupils that it would be worth their while to memorize 
these facts and must insist that they give the facts from 
memory after that and not count them out each time. 
Perhaps it would be better never to permit the pupils to 
count on their fingers but to use other objects that the 
pupils will not always have with them. The fingers are 
the natural counting machine, but counting on them should 
be discouraged, as it is so easy for the pupils to form the 
habit of relying on them. 
Teachers in developing a new rule or process sometimes 
have the pupils “think it out” for several days before 
reducing it to a habit. Thus, in long division, the pupils 
handle it as a thought process for several days and after- 
wards mechanize it. The pupils’ practice on the funda- 
mentals should be mechanical from the very beginning. 
This does not mean that new facts and processes should 
be given to the pupils arbitrarily. It is all right for the 
pupil to discover a new fact by counting or by thinking it 
out from some known fact, or to discover a new process, 
by thinking it out in detail, but once arrived at, it should
-P-A-G-E-164
158 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
be used and drilled on mechanically. To permit a pupil 
to think out a fact or process each time he uses it is tu 
run the risk of his forming the habit of thinking it out 
each time, and as a result he will not only waste time but 
will make more mistakes than if he does it mechanically. 
In a third grade drill recitation, recently observed by the 
author, the teacher called on a pupil for 6X8. He did not 
know, so the teacher asked 5X8? He remembered this 
and from it got that 6848. The teacher was trying to 
teach the pupils to help themselves, but in so doing was 
running the risk of letting the pupils form the habit of 
thinking out the facts instead of depending on their mem- 
ory for them. It would have been better if this teacher had 
called on another pupil to tell the first one what 6X8 is, 
had the first pupil repeat it, and returned to him fre- 
quently during the recitation to see whether he remem- 
bered the fact. 
<. Another(mistake frequently made is to teach one method 
first becausé it is easier for the pupil to understand (this 
usually means “easier for the teacher to teach”) and later 
teach the more usable method. An instance of this 
occurs in the division of fractions. Some books first teach 
the pupils to divide fractions by changing to a common 
denominator as %—”@—Y42+%2—-8+9—%. After drilling 
on this method for awhile they teach the shorter method 
of inverting the divisor as 4--4—% x %—=%. The shortest 
and consequently the best method of dividing fractions is 
the method of inversion and consequently this is the 
method that should be taught in the schools and made 
habitual with the pupils. the habit of inverting is to 
be fully established it must be formed from the very 
‘beginning. To form one habit and then try to break it 
and later form a better habit, almost invariably results in 
one of two things almost equally bad, either neither habit 
is fully established and as a result the pupils can not
-P-A-G-E-165
EXCEPTIONS TO DESIRED HABITS 159 
successfully divide fractions, or else the earlier habit per- 
sists and the pupils go through life handicapped by using 
a long, roundabout method. 
Avoid Use of Crutches. Pupils are often permitted 
to use auxiliary figures when a process is first introduced 
because the teacher thinks the use of such figures makes 
the process easier. Any device used temporarily while the 
pupils are weak, to make the work easier but later dropped, 
is a crutch. The trouble with such aids is that they 
are often not temporary but persist and become habitual. 
As all such aids take time they necessarily stand in the 
way of rapid work. Probably the safest course is never 
to permit the pupils to use such aids. It may make the 
process a little harder at first, but it is easier to get along 
without the crutch than it is to make the pupils stop 
using it when its use is no longer necessary. The most 
common examples of such crutches are (1) Writing down 
the figure to be carried in addition, multiplication and 
division, and (2) Crossing out and changing the figure 
in borrowing in subtraction. The author recently saw 
the following example in multiplication on the paper of a 
college freshman:

Never Drill Without the Attention of the Pupils. In 
discussing attention the statement was made that (to con- 
tinue drill after the attention of the class is lost is not 
only a waste of effort but may do positive harm. Lack of 
attention will result in many mistakes being made and to 
eéntinue the drill under these conditions will not only

do nothing towards establishing the desired habits but 
will tend to cancel the effect of the previous drill ,and 
may even start false habits that will make the forrfation 
of the correct habits very difficult. If for any reason 
whatsoever the teacher can not get or keep the pupils’ 
attention she should stop the drill—to continue will do 
more harm than good.

TB ACCURACY AND SPEED IN THE FUNDA- 
MENTALS eter Vi 
Relation of Accuracy to Speed. Popular opinion is not 
at all agreed on the relation between accuracy and speed. 
One belief is embodied in the old saying, “Slow but sure.” 
That is, many people believe that the two traits are more 
or less opposed to each other and that the slow calculator 
is apt to be more accurate than the fast, and vice versa. 
If this is true it would mean that we would have to sac- 
rifice one trait for the other or else strike a happy medium 
in both. While many teachers hold this view and believe 
that an increase in speed is necessarily gained at the 
expense of accuracy, the majority of teachers probably 
hold the directly opposite view, 7.e., that the two traits 
necessarily go together, that the most rapid calculators 
are the most accurate; that any increase in accuracy brings 
about a corresponding increase in speed. If this were 
true, all that the teacher would néed to do would be to 
strive in every way to increase accuracy and let speed 
take care of itself. There is the third possibility that the 
two traits are neither necessarily opposed to each other 
nor do they necessarily go together, but are independent 
and either may occur without the other, or both may occur 
together. The author has not found this belief nearly as 
common among teachers as the other two. 
Fortunately, we have experimental evidence which 
proves conclusively which of these views is the correct 
one. Stone* showed that there 4s no necessary relation- 
He

Them. )   
161 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
162 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
ship between the two traits. In his investigation the 
school system that ranked first in accuracy was twelfth in 
rapidity, and the system that was second in accuracy was 
seventeenth in rapidity. On the other hand the system 
that was first in speed was also third in accuracy, and the 
system fourth in accuracy was also fifth in speed. These 
results show that while it is possible to get a high degree 
of speed without a corresponding high degree of accuracy 
and vice versa, it is also possible to get a high degree of 
both accuracy and speed. In short, accuracy and speed 
are independent qualities. This means that in teaching, it 
jis not necessary to sacrifice accuracy to speed or speed to 
accuracy, as one can get both) It also means, however, 
that if the teacher is to get both she must try for both; 
speed does not come as a by-product. of accuracy or accu- 
racy as a by-product of speed. 
Importance of Accuracy. A frequent criticism of our 
schools today is that the boys and girls coming from these 
schools are inaccurate; they can not add, subtract, multi- 
ply or divide with reasonable assurance of getting the 
correct result the first or even the second time they try. 
Anyone who has had any experience with school children 
in the grades or even in the high school must admit the 
truth of this criticism. Such a situation is a serious 
indictment of the arithmetic work being doné in our schools 
today. Success in any work in life that demands any 
considerable use of arithmetic is impossible to one who is 
inaccurate in the fundamentals. The teacher of arith- 
metic has no more important task than to do all in her 
power to develop a high degree of accuracy in the funda- 
mental facts and processes. Mere practice does not insure 
accuracy ; constant and intelligent effort on the part of the 
teacher is absolutely necessary. 
Importance of Speed. Poplar opinion seems to regard 
speed as less important than ay\suracy. It is certainly true
-P-A-G-E-169
Lm ACCURACY AND SPEED 163 
that life demands a very high degree of accuracy and that 
one can never become too accurate, i.e., more accurate than 
necessary to meet practical demands. It is also true that 
the situation is somewhat different with respect to speed. 
Zit is possible, by systematic practice, to gain a degree of 
speed that is useless in life simply because it is greater 
than is necessary to meet practical needs. It is equally 
true, however, that it is possible for one to be badly handi- 
capped by the fact that his rate of speed in the funda- 
mentals is less than life situations demand. In short, 
success in life demands at least a reasonable minimum of 
speed; to exceed this very greatly is unnecessary, but to 
fall very far below it is just as disastrous as to be inac- 
curate. Just what this minimum of speed is we do not 
know exactly ; indeed, it may vary considerably in different 
vocations. We do, however, have certain standards of 
reasonable speed in the case of the four fundamental oper- 
‘ations with integers. The Courtis Standard Research 
Tests, Series A and Series B, give standards of speed for 
the elementary facts and the complete processes respec- 
tively. While these standards are largely based on results 
actually obtained in the schools and not on what the world 
demands, they are much better than no standards at all. 
Indeed the speed given by the eighth grade standards is 
probably somewhat higher than required in practical work, 
so these standards at least set an upper limit on what con- 
stitutes reasonable and desirable speed. These Tests and 
other Standard Tests are described in detail in Chapter 
Vil, Part III. 
How to Develop Accuracy and Speed in the Funda- 
mentals. In striving to develop accuracy and speed the 
teacher needs to know two things: (1) Neither accuracy 
nor speed is possible unless certain habits on which they 
depend are thoroughly established. (2) Accuracy and 
speed are themselves partly a matter of habit and the 
   
-P-A-G-E-170
  164 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
teacher must go about forming these habits just as sys- 
tematically as she does the habits involved in the funda- 
mental facts and processes. 
Hasirs NECESSARY TO ACCURACY AND SPEED 
Among the more important habits that must be formed 
if the pupils are to attain reasonable accuracy and speed 
in the fundamentals are: (1) The habits involved in the 
fundamental facts and processes, (2) The habit of using 
a good form, (3) The habit of making legible figures, 
(4) Habits of brief thinking in the fundamental processes, 
(5) The habit of using short methods wherever applicable, 
(6) The habit of checking all calculations as soon as per- 
formed. 
Fundamentals Must be Habituated. The most import- 
tant habits conditioning accuracy and speed are the habits 
involved in the fundamental facts and processes. If these 
habits are not thoroughly established neither accuracy nor 
speed is possible. Many mistakes occur and much time: 
is lost simply because the necessary habits are not fully 
formed, the necessary responses have not been made 
entirely habitual. ae is impossible if the fundamentals 
have to be thought out each timey The roundabout 
thought methods sometimes taught as aids to memory 
are thoroughly pernicious. Some teachers, for example, 
teach their pupils in adding : to add 10 and subtract 1 
instead of adding 9. It takes no longer to remember the 
sum of 8 and 9 than it does to think 18 and every extra 
thought takes time. 
Such devices inevitably slow up the work and are also 
apt to cause mistakes, as habitual responses are more accu- 
rate and rapid than those that depend on thought. The 
fundamental facts and processes must be thoroughly 
mechanized and habituated to insure speed and accuracy.
-P-A-G-E-171
ACCURACY AND SPEED 165 
The formation of these habits has already been discussed 
in detail. 
The remaining habits are formed in the same way as 
the other habits already discussed. The two most impor- 
tant things for the teacher to remember are: (1) That she 
must first convince the pupils of the desirability and neces- 
sity of the habit (provide a motive), and (2) That she 
must do all in her power to prevent any exceptions to 
the desired habit until it is fully established. 
Correct Form. Many mistakes occur in the processes 
because of the incorrect or careless form used. The 
teacher must insist on an accurate and Correct form in all 
written work from the very beginning and without excep- 
tion, until the use of such a form becomes habitual. ( Per- 
haps the most important detail of correct form is the 
keeping of straight columns,) This is not only important 
in addition but equally as important in subtraction, multi- 
plication and division. The habit of putting figures in 
the proper column and exactly in the column must be 
thoroughly established. 
Legible Figures. Another class of mistakes similar to 
the last arises from carelessness in forming the numerical 
figures or number symbols. Pupils write a 7 carelessly 
and later call it 1, or write 4 and eall it 9, ete. Again 
it is the (eacher’s duty to insist that the pupils make legible 
figures from the beginning and to permit no exceptions 
until the habit of writing figures legibly is thoroughly 
established. Poor form and illegible figures also stand in 
the way of attaining reasonable speed. Even if no mistakes 
are made it is a waste of valuable time t> have to stop and 
puzzle over a figure to determine whether it is a 2 or a 3, 
or whether it is in tens or hundreds column. 
Besides permitting no exceptions the teacher must do all 
in her power to convince the pupils that proper form and 
legible figures pay. Every time a mistake o¢éurs due to 
ey j 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  Ce 166 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
either poor form or illegible figures, the attention of the 
whole class should be called to it, and if, as is often the 
ease, there are pupils who can not hold their own in drill- 
ing with a time limit because they make illegible figures 
or are careless about form, or both, they and the class 
should be made to realize the cause of their being slow, 
and interested in trying to remove the handicap. 
Brief Thinking in the Fundamental Processes. Many 
pupils are badly handicapped by having to think too many 
words in performing the fundamental processes. 
For example, in adding such as the one in the 
margin some pupils think “8 and 5 are 13, 13 and 
9 are 22, 22 and 3 are 25,” thinking each combina- 
tion separately instead of thinking results only, 
namely, 13, 22, 25. In additive subtraction some 
pupils think “what added to 7 will give 9?” and then 
answer “2,” instead of thinking “7 and 2.” In practice 
the pupils should see the 9 and 7 but consciously think only 
the result “2.” In division in an example such as 2)86 
some teachers have the pupils think “How many 2’s in 8?” 
and answer “4,” or “2 goes into 8 four times” instead of 
the briefer form “2 in 8, 4.” Again the pupils should see 
the 2 and 8, but consciously think only the result 4. 
In all four of the processes the teacher should see to 
it that the pupils form the habit of thinking results only 
and not the entire combination. From the very beginning 
she should standardize the terminology used in performing 
the fundamental processes and reduce it to an absolute 
minimum. uch of the early work on any new phase*of 
a process must be oral so that the teacher can tell how the 
pupils are thinking And can make sure that they are form- 
ing the proper habits. 
Again it is important that no exceptions be permitted 
and if the pupils have already formed the habit of thinking 
in too many words they must be convinced that they are [ao on © w
-P-A-G-E-173
- ACCURACY AND SPEED 167 
handicapped by this and interested in overcoming this 
handicap. One of the best ways of doing this is to give 
the class drill with a time limit. If a pupil is seriously 
handicapped he will soon discover the fact, as he will not 
be able to do as much as the other pupils in the given time. 
The Habit of Using Short Methods. Many so called 
short methods should not be taught in the grades. Some 
of these are not really much shorter than the ordinary 
long method; others, although short when once mastered, 
apply to such special cases that the pupils will not have 
enough occasions to use them to justify taking the time 
necessary for their mastery. There are, however, some 
short methods that are so much shorter than the corre- 
sponding long methods and that can be used so frequently 
that every boy and girl should know them before leaving 
the grades. 
The pupils should be shown these short methods, but to 
stop here is to accomplish nothing. The best of short 
methods is often not short until the pupils have practiced 
on it until it has become mechanical and they can use it 
as readily as the long method. Even then very often the 
pupils will not use the short method, simply because they 
have not formed the habit of using it. Any short method 
that is worth teaching is worth drilling on until it is mech- 
anized, and the pupils must be forced to use it in their 
everyday calculations until its use has become habitual. 
The author recently saw a high school sophomore divide 
3.1416 by 10 and use long division! Upon inquiry it 
developed that she knew the short method but had never 
formed the habit of using it. If the short method is really 
short the teacher can easily convince the pupils that the 
habit of using it is worth forming, and then it is simply a 
question of permitting no exceptions. 
The Habit of Checking All Work. The habit of check- 
ing all work in the fundamentals is one of the most impor-  
-P-A-G-E-174
  
168 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
tant aids in attaining accuracy. Methods of checking 
should be taught early in the grades and the pupils should 
be required to use them until their use has become a habit. 
It should become second nature with the pupils to check 
all calculations as soon as performed; in fact, the caleula- 
tion is not finished until they have determined that it is 
correct. 
The pupils can easily be convinced of the importance of 
checking, both in school and in life. In school it makes 
them independent of the book and the teacher. By check- 
ing they are able to discover their mistakes before coming 
to class and so have the opportunity of correcting them. 
Checking makes answers in the back of the book unneces- 
sary. Much might be said about the importance of check- 
ing calculations in life. The practical man who uses his 
mathematics in practical affairs must be able to rely on 
the accuracy of his results, and no matter how accurate 
he may be he will occasionally make mistakes, so in all 
practical work mathematical calculations must always be 
checked in some way. 
Hasirs oF ACCURATE AND Rapiy Work 
Accuracy and speed, to a certain extent at least, are 
themselves habits and may be' formed in the same way as 
other habits. Pupils are often slow and inaccurate for no 
other reason except that they have been permitted and 
have permitted themselves to fall into the habit of working ~ 
slowly and carelessly. In trying to form in her pupils 
the habits of working accurately and as rapidly as possible, 
the two most important tasks of the teacher, again, are 
(1) To convince the pupils that accuracy and speed pay, 
that it will be worth their while to cultivate these habits; 
and (2) To permit no exceptions to the desired habits. 
Convince the Pupils That Accuracy and Speed Pay. 
Not only do many pupils get through the grades without
-P-A-G-E-175
ACCURACY AND SPEED 169 
being able to add a column of figures with any assurance 
of getting the correct result, but in many cases they are 
not at all concerned about their inability to do so. Indeed 
many pupils in the upper grades seem to feel that accuracy 
in computation is of no importance and that it is below 
their dignity to concern themselves with such elementary 
things. Such an attitude is the direct result of the kind 
of teaching these pupils have had. If the teacher expects 
accuracy in computation from her pupils she must do 
everything in her power to impress them with its impor- 
tance both in and out of school. 
As previously stated, popular opinion regards speed as 
less important than accuracy. e tedcher must overcome 
this attitude and eénvince the pupils that reasonable speed 
and accuracy are both essential to success in school and 
in life. Among the\zhol important methods of doing this 
are the following: (1) Attitude of teacher, (2) Example 
of teacher, (3) Games, (4) Standards, and (5) Show the 
importance of accuracy and speed in life. 
Attitude of Teacher. Many teachers apparently do not 
themselves realize the importance of accuracy, and seem 
fairly well satisfied with inaccurate work. Some teachers 
even do things that positively encourage inac- 
3785 curacy. Among these may be mentioned the prac- 
4862 tice of some teachers in grading drill examples. 
8647 An example such as the one in the margin, having 
four places in the answer is sometimes graded 
75 per cent correct if three of the four figures are correct, 
50 per cent if two of the four are right, ete. 
Still more common is the practice of allowing practically 
full credit in the solution of applied problems for the 
correct method of solution even if the result is wrong. 
Such practices as these inevitably result in the pupils 
unconsciously coming to believe that accuracy in computa- 
tion is not very important. The result obtained in adding
-P-A-G-E-176
  170 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
the numbers in the example given above is either right or 
wrong; it can not be 50 per cent right. A mistake in one 
of the four figures makes the whole answer wrong. In 
working an applied problem the result is the only thing 
that counts, socially speaking, and the pupils must be made 
to realize this. If our problem is to find the number of 
acres in a tract of land the accuracy of our result is what 
counts; the process by which that result was obtained is 
of no importance. If in buying a tract of land the sur- 
veyor made a mistake in figuring the number of acres 
and one paid for more land than he got, the fact that the 
surveyor had used the correct method in computing the 
acreage would be poor consolation. 
We can not expect the pupils to attach very much impor- 
tance to accuracy of computation if the teacher shows that 
she does not, by giving a high grade on any example or 
problem in which a mistake has been made in calculation. 
If the pupils are to be made to realize the importance of 
accuracy the teacher must demand absolute, 100 per cent 
accuracy all of the time, and must be satisfied with nothing 
else. If the teacher does not realize the importance of 
speed the pupils are not apt to do so. The teacher should 
constantly demand reasonable speed as well as absolute 
accuracy and should not be satisfied, or permit the pupil

slow. The author once saw a drill recitation in a sixth 
grade in which the pupils were having a review drill on 
the multiplication facts. The teacher held up before the 
class a pack of cards, each card having two numbers 
printed upon it. The first pupil to recite made several 
mistakes and sat down realizing that he had made a poor 
showing. The next pupil went through the entire pack 
of cards without making a single mistake, but was very 
slow and had to stop an appreciable instant to think before 
giving each answer. The teacher praised this pupil, and

  ACCURACY AND SPEED uzal 
she sat down beaming and evidently thought that she had 
done all that could be expected of a sixth grade pupil. 
Such teaching is bound to result disastrously as far as 
speed is concerned. 
Example of the Teacher. An inaccurate teacher will 
never make accurate pupils. In the first place, such a 
teacher may fail to detect. mistakes made by the pupils 
More serious than this, however, is the unconscious effect 
of the teacher’s example. The teacher may do all in her 
power to impress the importance of accuracy on the pupils, 
but her efforts will constantly be thwarted, as the pupils 
have before them daily a person whom they probably 
regard as fairly successful in life who has attained to 
that success in spite of inaccuracy. Such a teacher should 
overcome her disability or, if that is impossible, should get 
into some work where it will handicap no one but herself. 
The teacher must be able to work rapidly herself and set 
the pupils an example. If the teacher is slow the pupils 
will also be slow. Not only does the example of the teacher 
have its bad effect but the speed of much of the drill work 
is limited by the speed of the teacher. 
Checks. One of the best ways to convince pupils that 
accuracy pays is to teach methods of checking calcula- 
tions and to require the pupils to use them until their use 
has become habitual. Checks not only enable the pupils 
to detect and correct their own mistakes but also auto- 
matically punish inaccuracy. If the pupils are drilling on 
column addition, instead of assigning ten examples to be 
worked without checking, the teacher could give the class 
five columns to be added and checked. If no mistakes 
are made the pupils have to add ten columns (re-adding 
each a second time as a check), but every time a mistake is 
made the pupils are punished by having to add a column a 
third time in order to detect the mistake. If required to 
check and correct all calculations, the pupils soon learn that
-P-A-G-E-178
172 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
it is easier in the long run to be more careful and “get 
it right” the first time. They soon find that accuracy 
pays. 
Games. No game should be used in arithmetic that does 
not demand absolute accuracy. The pupils soon find that 
they can not win or even make a creditable showing in 
these games if they are inaccurate. Success in many of 
the games depends upon being able to work rapidly as 
well as accurately, this being particularly true of number 
races of all sorts. Such games do much to convince pupils 
that it pays to be able to work both accurately and rapidly. 
For a discussion of the use of games, see Chapter VI, 
Part III. 
Standards. Nothing will do more to increase the speed 
and accuracy of the pupils than to set up definite stand- 
dards. Pupils often do not realize how slow and inaccurate 
they are until they are tested by standard tests and given 
the opportunity to compare their scores with those of 
other schools and with the standard scores. Drill devices 
such as the Studebaker Economy Practice Tests and the 
Courtis Standard Practice Tests, and standard tests of all 
kinds keep a definite standard constantly before the pupils, 
and as a result do much to develop speed and accuracy. 
For a discussion of these tests see Chapter VII, Part III. 
Importance of Accuracy and Speed in Life. Unfortu- 
nately, pupils sometimes get the impression that success 
in life does not depend upon the same qualities as success 
in school. In every possible way the teacher must drive 
home the importance of accuracy and speed in the funda- 
mentals to success in life. This can be best done, perhaps, 
in connection with the applied problems in arithmetic. 
The problem should provide the connecting link between 
the school and life; indeed, it should be an actual life 
situation, or the description of such a situation, brought 
into the school-room. In dealing with such a problem 
   
-P-A-G-E-179
  
ACCURACY AND SPEED 173 
the pupils and teacher should consider not only its arith- 
metical relations but also its social setting and significance. 
The pupils must understand the social situation that gave 
rise to the problem and must put themselves in the place 
of the person who would have to solve such a problem. 
In solving a problem about making change the pupil 
should imagine himself a clerk in a store who actually 
has to make change and if he makes a mistake he must 
consider the possible results, such as having the amount 
of the mistake deducted from his wages, possible loss of 
his position, ete. In solving problems arising in the con- 
struction of a house, let the pupils put themselves in the 
place of the contractor and bid on the job of excavating 
the cellar. A mistake in calculation may wipe out the 
supposed profit and substitute a loss. 
It does little or no good for the teacher to tell the pupils 
that they will be handicapped in life by inaccuracy and 
slowness; they must be shown the results in concrete cases 
brought within their own experience. 
Permit No Exceptions. In order to establish a habit of 
accurate work the teacher must demand absolute, 100 per 
cent accuracy all of the time and must not let her sense of 
justice or anything else make her deviate from this course. 
Practices such as those previously mentioned of giving 
eredit for the process in the solution of concrete problems 
when the answer is wrong, and giving part credit when 
part of the figures of the answer are wrong, are disastrous. 
No exceptions must be permitted wntil the habit of accu- 
racy is established. Then if the teacher’s sense of justice 
leads her to give a pupil credit for thinking through a 
difficult applied problem correctly, although his answer is 
wrong because of some slight mistake in his calculations, 
no harm will be done; but until the habit of accurate 
work is established the teacher should permit no exceptions 
whatsoever.

174 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Avoid Methods of Drill that Demand Less than the 
Pupil’s Maximum Rate of Speed: Time Limit. Many 
teachers make the mistake of using methods of drill that 
develop the habit of working at less than the maximum 
rate of speed. The teacher must be sure that the methods 
of drill she is using are suited to her grade and to her 
pupils and that they force the pupils to work at their 
maximum rate of speed. 
Most of the drill after the facts or processes are fairly 
well established.must be done with a time limit. That is, 
the pupils should be given a certain definite period of time 
to see how much they can do. Whenever possible, a definite 
standard should be set up for the pupils to strive to reach. 
At first this standard should be comparatively low, but 
it should be gradually increased as the pupils’ speed 
increases. It is only by forcing the pupils to always work 
at their maximum possible rate of speed and gradually 
increasing this rate that we can establish the habit of 
speedy work. To permit exceptions by using methods o: 
drill that do not demand the pupils’ utmost speed wil 
render the task of forming the habit extremely difficul 
if not impossible.

MISCELLANEOUS POINTS ON DRILL 
ORGANIZATION OF Facts Drittep Upon 
The number of individual facts to be drilled upon in 
arithmetic is quite large,.there being one hundred in addi- 
tion alone and as many in each of the other processes. 
In drilling upon a series of facts, such as the addition 
combinations, the teacher should keep several things in 
mind. 
Include All the Facts. In drilling upon the primary 
facts in the four fundamental processes it is very impor- 
tant that none be omitted. It would be perfectly possible 
to drill day after day on addition facts and miss some 
entirely. The work must be systematized and organized 
in such a way as to make this impossible. 
Emphasize the More Difficult Facts. These facts are all 
equally important but not all equally difficult for the 
pupils to memorize. For example, 57 is usually much 
more easily remembered than 8X7. It is not always 
possible for the teacher to predict which facts are the 
most difficult, indeed it will vary somewhat with different 
classes and pupils. The teacher should encourage the 
pupils to find out which facts are most difficult for them 
and pick out these facts for extra drill. 
Drill on the Facts in All Forms that May be Met. The 
primary facts in the four operations may be met by the 
pupils in a variety of forms. Two forms, often called the 
horizontal and vertical, are quite common. In the fol- 
lowing the horizontal form is given first and is followed 
by the corresponding vertical form.

In life the pupils may meet both of these forms and so 
should meet both in school. 
Emphasize Form that Occurs Most Frequently. Al- 
though the pupils may meet both forms, they are not 
of equal importance. Only enough drill should be given 
on 9+3=12, 7—2—5, 3X7=21 and 12+3—4 to enable 
the pupils to understand these forms when they meet 
them. The pupils should receive most of their drill on 
the facts in the form in which they will meet these facts in

the processes, and that is +3, —2, 3 and 312" 
12 5 21 
Vary the Order of the Facts in Drilling. There has been 
much discussion as to the best order of teaching the funda- 
mental facts. This question was considered in Chapter VI, 
Part II. No matter what order is used in presenting the 
facts for the first time, in drilling upon them the order 
must be constantly changed. Formerly the multiplication 
facts were learned in the form of tables and each table 
was learned as a whole. The result was that the pupils 
knew the table as a whole instead of knowing each fact. 
individually, and as a result if they wanted to know 7X8 
they would sometimes have to start at the beginning of 
the table and “run it down.” If 7856 is to be learned 
as a separate fact, 78 and 56 must always be presented 
together, and they must be presented in varying surround- 
ings. If the facts 6<8—48 and 7X8=—56 are always kept 
together there is danger that the connection will be made 
between 56 and 48 instead of between 56 and 7X8, so that 
the pupils will have to go back to 6848 in order to 
get 7X8—56.

  POINTS ON DRILL 11? 
DistriBuTION 
The results obtained from drill depend not only upon 
the number of repetitions but also upon the distribution of 
the repetitions. Dr. Ebbinghaus in his experimental inves- 
tigation of memory (1885) showed that “with any con- 
siderable number of repetitions a suitable distribution of 
them over a space of time is decidedly more advantageous 
than the massing of them at a single time.” More recent 
investigations have confirmed this conclusion. The pur- 
pose of the drill work in arithmetic is to fix certain facts, 
rules and processes and make them permanent possessions 
of the mind. Suppose one wants to memorize a poem so 
that he will never forget it. He studies it until he can 
repeat it perfectly at the time, but after an interval of 
time, long or short, as the case may be, he finds that he 
can no longer repeat it. Apparently he has forgotten the 
poem completely, but in reality he has not; it has simply 
slipped the threshold of his memory and when he mem- 
orizes it again he finds that it takes fewer repetitions. 
After learning it the second time he forgets it again, but 
the rate of forgetting is less rapid. Thus, by learning and 
forgetting, then after an interval relearning and forget- 
ting, after another interval relearning and forgetting again, 
ete., the rate of forgetting eventually becomes so slow that 
for all practical purposes the poem has become a perma- 
nent possession of his mind. 
If we are to insure permanent retention of the funda- 
mental facts and processes of arithmetic we must provide 
for drill on them at recurring intervals throughout the 
school course. For this reason the fundamentals should 
be introduced as early as possible and drilled upon through- 
out the grades. Indeed, many high schools are finding it 
advantageous to provide systematic drill in the funda- 
mentals of arithmetic in the first two years. It is not

known exactly what length of drill period is most advan- 
tageous or exactly what length interval should elapse 
between successive drill periods. Kirby* found that a 
brief period produces better results than a longer period. 
It has also been found that the intervals between drill 
periods should be gradually increased and the length of 
the drill periods themselves gradually decreased. 
The author once heard a third grade teacher declare 
that she was going to give her pupils so much drill on — 
the multiplication tables that they would never forget 
them. This teacher wasted much time in trying to realize 
this ambition and then the pupils needed more drill in the 
fourth grade. One can not establish these habits all at 
once and should not expect to. Teachers frequently com- 
plain that the pupils they get from the preceding grade 
have forgotten certain things called for in the course of 
study. This should not be surprising, indeed it is the 
regular and natural order of things. The teacher should 
expect to have to teach over much that has been taught 
before, but at the same time should remember that the 
fact that it has to be taught over is not necessarily any 
reflection on the previous teacher, nor does it mean that 
the time spent on the topic the year before was wasted. 
The teacher has to bring it above the threshold of mem- 
ory again, but that will take much less time than it would 
to teach it if it were entirely new, and besides things 
usually have to be taught several times if they are to be 
retained. The author recalls that he first learned the - 
process of extracting square root in the eighth grade, used 
it a few days and promptly forgot it. The process was 
learned again in algebra in the freshman year of high 
school, forgotten, learned again in plane geometry, for- 
‘gotten, learned again in solid geometry and physics, for-   *Kirby, T. J—Practice in the Case of School Children.

retained until this day, although practically never used. 
One of the excellent features of the Courtis and Stude- 
baker Practice Tests described in Chapter VII, Part III, 
is the provision they make for recurring drill with short- 
ened periods.

GAMES 
Types of Games. Perhaps one of the most striking in- 
novations in the teaching of arithmetic in recent years 
has been the introduction of games. Like everything else 
that is new, their use has been overdone and they hav 
not always been wisely chosen or used. A knowledge o 
the various types of games and of the purposes for ot 
they may be used to advantage is necessary for thei 
intelligent choice and use. There are four types of games 
in common use: (1) Games proper, (2) Imaginative or 
“make-believe”’ games, (3) Races and contests, and (4 
Mathematical recreations, curiosities and puzzles. 
GamEs PROPER 
This type includes all parlor and outdoor games that 
involve numbers. They are games such as the childre 
play outside of school and not merely drill in an "inter 
esting way. The following are examples: 
  Bean Bag. There are many forms of this game. In 
one, the accompanying diagram is drawn on the floor with 
chalk. Several feet away a line is drawn, behind which 
the pupils stand and throw a bean bag at the center square 
marked 9. Each pupil in turn is given two throws, and 
180 
   
-P-A-G-E-187
GAMES 181 
his score is the sum of the two numbers hit. In order to 
get this score the pupil must state the sum correctly. 
Hither individual or team scores may be kept. 
“TI Am Thinking of Two Numbers.” The teacher says 
“T am thinking of two numbers whose sum is 7. What 
are they?” A pupil guesses, “Are you thinking of 6 and 
1 are 7?” and the teacher replies, “No, I am not thinking 
of 6 and 1 are 7,” etc., until some pupil guesses the com- 
bination correctly, when he takes the teacher’s place and 
proposes a problem. 
Pussy Wants a Corner. The pupils are arranged in a 
large ring with one in the center. The pupils in the ring 
are given numbers, each number being given to two differ. 
ent pupils. The one in the center calls “2 and 3” and 
the two pupils having the number 5 try to change places, 
the one in the center trying to get one of the vacant places 
while they are exchanging. 
‘The well-known games of hop-scotch, dominoes, ring- 
toss, lotto, parchesi, tenpins, and the spinning game in 
which balls are knocked into numbered holes by a spinning 
top all belong to this type. Such games are particularly 
suitable for use in the lower grades and may be played 
in school, at recess, or taught to the pupils and played 
outside of school hours. 
ImacinaTIVE on “Maks-BELIEvE” GAMES 
In this type the drill itself is the game, but it is put 
into an attractive form by the pupils imagining or pre- 
tending that they are doing something else. The added 
interest arising from rivalry may or may not enter into- 
such games. The following games belong to this type: 
Climb the Ladder. The combinations to be drilled upon 
are placed on the rungs of a ladder drawn on the black- 
board. As they give the combinations the pupils play they 
are climbing, first up the ladder and then down again. ~  
-P-A-G-E-188
  182 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Stepping Stones. The teacher draws on the board the 
picture of a river with a row of stepping stones from 
one bank to the other. On each stone is written a com 
bination. The pupils play they are crossing the river a 
they give the combinations. 
Other games of a similar character are “Walking th 
Ties to Boston,” “Nimble Squirrel Climbing a Tree,” “Fis 
Pond,” ete. Games of this type can be made intensely 
interesting to pupils in the lower grades, as they appeal 
to the child’s instinctive love of pretending. In order 
to be interesting, however, the teacher and pupils must 
enter into the imagined situation with their whole souls 
and must think and talk in terms of this situation. Giv- 
ing addition combinations written on a ladder or on ston 8 
is no more interesting than giving the same combinations 
written in a simple list on the blackboard unless one really 
pretends that he is climbing a ladder or crossing a 
stream. As an illustration, suppose a ladder leaning 
against an apple tree is drawn on the blackboard. On 
the tree are apples, and on each apple a combination. 
The pupils pretend they are climbing the ladder to get 
an apple. If a pupil hesitates too long in giving a com- 
bination on the ladder he is “stuck” and another pupil 
must give him a “boost.” If he gives a combination incor- 
rectly he “falls off the ladder.” When he gets to the 
top rung of the ladder he is to pick an apple by giving 
the combination. If he chooses an easy combination it 
is a small apple, while a difficult combination is a large 
one. Then he has to climb down again, which is often 
harder than going up. In the stepping-stone game 
the pupils may imagine they are crossing a stream. 
If they make a mistake they slip and fall into the 
water and someone must volunteer to rescue them by 
going out over the stones and giving the combinations 
correctly. |

GAMES 183 
Races anp ConrTeESTS 
Three Types of Emulation. In this type of game the 
drill itself is again the game, but is made interesting by 
being put into the form of a race or contest. The interest 
arises wholly from the appeal made to the spirit of emula- 
tion or rivalry. The rivalry may be (a) between indi- 
viduals, (b) between groups or teams, or (c) with self. 4 
Rivalry Between Individuals. There are several objec- 
tions to the use of rivalry between individuals. One type 
of race involving this kind of rivalry is as follows. The 
teacher places on the board two sets of examples of equal 
length and difficulty. Two pupils go to the board to 
race and at a given signal start solving the examples. 
The first one through is the winner, providing all of his 
examples are correct. Such a race is open to the objection 
that it is very wasteful of time, as only two pupils out 
of the class are getting the drill, while the others are merely, 
watching. To correct this difficulty all of the pupils might 
be sent to the board; or, if board space is too limited to 
permit of this, each pupil might be given a sheet or card 
containing examples to be worked-at their seats. In this 
way all of the pupils are participating in the race, but 
the rivalry is still individual, as each pupil is trying to 
finish first. As a result the slower pupils are forced to 
compete with the faster, which is bad for both, as the 
slow ones become discouraged and the others lose interest. 
Any method of procedure that forces or encourages the 
comparison of pupils of unequal ability is fundamentally 
bad. Further, rivalry between individuals tends to foster 
habits and ideals of individualism and selfishness, and 
often leads to ill feeling among the pupils. Individual 
rivalry, if used - all, must be"used sparingly and with a 
full knowledge of its weaknesses and possible dangers. 
Group Rivalry. Rivalry between groups or teams, if 
properly handled, possesses none of the weaknesses of indi-
-P-A-G-E-190
184 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
vidual rivalry. Enough teams can be formed so as to 
include every member of the class so all the pupils can 
participate in the contest, and by carefully selecting the 
teams they can be made of approximately equal ability, 
the slow pupils being balanced by quicker ones. In this 
way, as each team has a chance to win, there is an incentive 
for each pupil to do his best. Such rivalry fosters the 
social spirit among the pupils, encourages them to work 
for the general good of a group rather than for their 
own individual good. Further, it brings to the teacher’s 
aid a very powerful foree—social pressure—that can be 
used very effectively in dealing with the lazy and indif- 
ferent pupil. 
A superintendent recently told the author the following 
incident: Three fourth grade boys were brought before 
him for fighting. The case looked rather serious, as appar- 
ently two of the boys had attacked the third. Upon 
inquiry the following explanation was obtained from the 
boys: The fourth grade teacher had her arithmetic class 
divided into two permanent teams, the “Reds” and the 
“Blues.” Score was kept on all drill work and at the 
end of each week the team having the highest score was 
declared the winner. The three boys were all members 
of the “Reds” and their team had been losing consistently 
for several weeks, due to the fact that one of the boys 
was not trying. To use the boys’ own words, what they 
had done to this boy was only a sample of what they 
would do if he didn’t “get busy.” The superintendent 
decided not to interfere, but kept in touch with the situa- 
tion through the boys’ teacher, who reported that the lazy 
boy'‘immediately “got busy,” with the result that the 
“Reds” won their full share of the weekly contests. 
Self Emulation. Self emulation has in the past been 
somewhat neglected in our schools, but in recent years its 
use has become more general. The following is an illus-  
-P-A-G-E-191
GAMES 185 
tration of this kind of work. The pupils of a sixth grade 
have been drilling on long division, and as a test of their 
ability their teacher prepares a list of examples of approxi- 
mately equal difficulty and gives the pupils a certain time, 
say ten minutes, to see how many of the examples they 
ean solve correctly. The number of examples given is 
more than any of the pupils can solve in the given time. 
At the end of the ten minutes the papers are corrected 
and each pupil makes a record of the number attempted 
and the number correct, which constitutes his score. This 
score is kept and later, having drilled on long division 
in the meantime, a similar list of examples is given and 
each pupil tries to improve his previous score by solving 
more correctly in the same time. 
This kind of work is particularly good in that it empha- 
sizes self-improvement, which is one of the most useful 
motives and ideals that the school can inculcate. The 
pupils can not all hope to “beat the other fellow,” perhaps 
at his own game, and if they try they are foredoomed to 
failure. Most of the pupils must learn to be satisfied 
and content with doing their best, but it should be a con- 
stantly growing best. Self emulation is just as effective 
with the slow pupils as it is with the quicker ones; there 
is always the possibility of improvement, no matter how 
slow the pupil may be. 
This type of rivalry, if skillfully used, can be made 
just as interesting to the pupils as either of the others. 
The author recently saw a drill lesson of this type in a 
fourth grade. At the end, each pupil reported his score 
for that day together with his best previous score. The 
girl who had made the poorest score was the happiest; 
she had five examples correct, whereas before she had never 
been able to get more than three. By emphasizing self- 
improvement this girl was spurred on to redoubled efforts, 
whereas she would have been very badly discouraged if  
-P-A-G-E-192
  
186 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
she had been led or permitted to compare her work with 
that of the other members of the class. 
Two Kinds of Races. Aside from the kind of rivalry 
involved, races may be of two kinds: (a) All of the con- 
testants do the same amount of work and the winner is 
judged according to the time taken; (6) all of the con- 
testants work for the same length of time and the winner 
is judged by the amount done. ‘The first type of race 
has been most common in arithmetic, probably due to the 
fact that it is the type with which we are most familiar in 
running, horse, bicycle and automobile racing. The second 
type of race is not unknown even here, however, as witness 
the one-hour walking, the six-day bicycle, and the one-hour 
automobile races. 
Comparison of Two Types. The second type of race 
possesses many advantages over the first for school use. 
In the first place it is more economical of time. If the 
pupils are all given the same amount of work, as in the 
first type, the quicker pupils will get done first and have 
nothing to do, while they wait for the slowest pupil to 
finish. On the other hand, in the second type of race all 
of the pupils are busy for the entire period, all start and 
stop together at a given signal. 
In the second place, it is much easier to determine the 
relative standing of the pupils in the race with a time limit. 
The pupil having the largest number of examples correct 
at the end of the given time is first, the one having the 
second largest number correct is second, ete. In order to 
emphasize the importance of absolute accuracy some teach- 
ers give a score, say of five, for each correct example, and 
penalize by deducting one from the total score for each 
one that is incorrect. Thus a pupil who worked eight 
examples in the given time and had six correct would get 
a score of thirty less a penalty of two for inaccuracy, 
giving a net score of twenty-eight.
-P-A-G-E-193
GAMES 187 
Finally, this type of race lends itself more readily to 
keeping scores by teams. If the first type is used and 
there are five members on each side it is difficult to deter- 
mine which team is the winner if the members finish in 
the following order: 
Team A—1 3 5 810 
Team B—2 4 6 7 9 
Sometimes the “order numbers” are added for the two 
teams and the team having the smaller sum is called the 
winner. In this case Team A would win, having a sum 
of 27 to B’s 28. Or else, the winner is declared to be 
the team all of whose members finish first. Under these 
conditions Team B would be the winner, as the last mem- 
ber of this team finished before the last member of Team A. 
Neither of these methods of determining team scores is 
entirely satisfactory, and the second is positively harmful. 
It throws the entire burden of losing on the shoulders of 
the slowest pupil. Imagine how anxious each team would 
be to have this slowest pupil and imagine the effect on 
such a pupil. Other difficulties arise when some of the 
examples are solved incorrectly. These are not insur- 
mountable but are, to say the least, very troublesome. 
None of these difficulties occur in determining team 
scores in the second type of race. The team scores are 
simply the sums of the scores made by the individual 
members of the team, only those examples being counted 
that are solved correctly. Further, the two teams need 
not be equal in number, as the average team score can 
easily be found. Suppose two teams one of four and the 
other of five members, have scores ¥ examples correct as

tice in figuring averages and shows the necessity for obtain- 
ing such averages. The use of averages is so important 
in life that everything possible should be done to empha- 
size them in school. 
MarHemMaticaL PuzzuEs, CURIOSITIES AND RECREATIONS 
Mathematical puzzles, curiosities and recreations of all 
kinds have been very much neglected in our schools, per- 
haps because they are suitable for the intermediate and 
upper grades, and the teachers in these grades are just 
commencing to realize that they can use games of the 
proper sort to just as great advantage as the teacher in the 
primary grades. The following will serve to illustrate 
this type of game or recreational material. 
Guessing Game. This is a well known game and can be 
played in many different ways. One simple form is as 
follows: Pupil A tells pupil B to think of some number 
and remember it, add’‘8, add the original number, divide 
by 2, subtract the original number and the answer will 
always be 4. For example, start with 9, adding 8 gives 17, 
adding the original number (9) gives 26, dividing by 2 
gives 13 and subtracting the original number (9) gives 4. 
The operations used and the answer obtained may be varied, 
but the operations must always be so chosen as to eliminate 
the original number. This becomes clear if we represent 
the operations algebraically. Let n stand for the number, 
then the results in the successive steps are n, n+8, 2n+8, 
n-+4, 4. 2 
Mysterious Additi@s. Have some one write a number 
and under it a second ‘xgmber having the same number of 
digits. Then, write a third number such that the sum of 
its digits and the corresp€nding digits of the number above 
will always be 9. Have sme one else write a fourth num- 
ber and then write a fifth in the same way as before. The
-P-A-G-E-195
GAMES 189 
sum of the five numbers will always be the first 
8789 number written with the digit 2 written in front 
2495 of the other digits and with two subtracted from 
7504 + the last digit. The numbers in heavy black and 
8726 the answer are written by the person perform- 
1273 ing the trick, the others by anyone else. The 
23787 explanation is simple. The second and third 
numbers taken together make 9999 and the 
fourth and fifth make the same. The sum of 9999 and 
9999 is 19,998 to be added to the original number. But 
19,998 is just 2 less than 20,000, so adding 19,998 is the 
same as adding 20,000 and subtracting 2. This is done 
readily by placing a 2 in front of the other digits and 
subtracting 2 from the last digit. The numbers used may 
have any number of digits but no one of them can have 
any more than the first number written. Instead of five 
numbers, seven or nine may be added in the same way, 
in which case 3 and 4, respectively, must be prefixed and 
subtracted instead of 2. 
Russian Multiplication. The following method of mul- 
tiplication, said to be in use among the Russian peasants, 
requires only the ability to add and to multiply and divide 
by 2. To multiply 85 by 94 write the two 
85 94 numbers at the head of two columns. Each 
42 188 number in the first column is divided 
21 376 by 2; if the quotient is not an integer 
10 752 only the integral part is written. This is 
5 1504 continued until the quotient is 1. In the 
2 .3008 second column each number is multipled 
1 6016 by 2 until as many numbers are obtained 
7990 as in the first column. Then the numbers 
in the second column that stand opposite 
odd numbers in the first colmun are added, which gives the 
required product. In this case the numbers in heavy black 
type are added, giving 7990 as the product of 85 by 94.  
-P-A-G-E-196
  
190 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
The explanation is simple and depends on the principle 
that if in the product of two numbers one of the factors is 
multiplied by any number and the other factor divided 
by the same number the product remains the same. The 
following should make the explanation clear: 
85X94—84<94-4+94—42 X 188-4 94-—21 X376-+94=20 
376-+376-+94—10752-+376+94—5 X 1504-4 376-+94—4 
X1504-+1504-+376-+94—=2 x 3008-1 1504-+376 + 94—=1X 
6016-+1504+-376-+94—6016-+1504-+376-194. 
Puzzle Problems. Puzzle problems such as the follow- 
ing and the two given in the first chapter of this book 
rightfully belong to this class of games. 
1. Three travelers met at an inn, and two of them 
brought their provisions along with them; but the third, 
not having provided any, proposed to the,other two that 
they should all eat together, and he would pay them for 
his proportion. This being agreed to, A produced 5 loaves, 
and B 3 loaves, which the travelers ate together and C 
paid eight equal pieces of money as the value of his share, 
with which the other two were satisfied but quarreled 
about the division of them. Upon this, the affair was 
referred to an umpire, who decided the dispute justly. 
What was his decision? 
2. A hare starts 50 leaps before a greyhound, and takes 
4 leaps to the hound’s 3; but 2 of the hound’s leaps are 
equal to 3 of the hare’s. How many leaps must the hound 
make to overtake the hare? 
Used occasionally as puzzles such problems are a valu- 
able means of increasing the pupils’ interest in the subject; 
used constantly under the pretense of being practical or 
life problems they cannot be condemned too strongly. 
Old Methods of Calculating. In the upper grades pupils 
are interested in abacus reckoning and old methods of 
calculating with the Hindu-Arabic numerals. The follow.

Europe, will serve as an illustration:

Purposes ror WuicH Games ARE UsEp 
Games are ordinarily used to serve one or more of four 
purposes, (1) as drill, (2) as a motive for drill, (3) to 
encourage accuracy and speed, or (4) to create an interest 
in mathematics in general and arithmetic in particular. 
Drill Games. A game that is used for drill must be 
above all things economical of time; it must provide for 
a maximum number of repetitions per pupil per minute. 
Besides this, it must be interesting or it will fail of its 
purpose, namely, to lend variety and interest to the drill 
work. Games of the second and third type are usually 
suitable for drill work, as the game is really nothing but 
the drill put into an interesting form. 
Motivating Games. On the other hand games of the 
first type are apt to be too slow and wasteful of time to 
be of much use for drill. They may, however, serve another 
purpose, namely, provide a reason or motive for drill to 
be done in some other way. The first requisite of a game 
to use for this purpose is interest. Even if it is somewhat 
wasteful of time and even if the pupils get little or no 
drill from the game itself, if the game is very interesting 
and the pupils like to play it the teacher is justified in  
-P-A-G-E-198
192 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
taking the time occasionally. The pupils will gladly drill 
for a week in order to play a favorite game. 
Games used for drill may be used frequently in order 
to lend variety and interest, but games used solely as a 
motive for drill should only be used occasionally. Games 
of the first type are usually too wasteful of time to use 
except as a motive for drill work. The pupils get very 
little drill from Bean Bag, Tenpins, ete., but if they 
enjoy these games an occasional period devoted to them 
is time well spent, as it will provide a reason for drilling 
for at least a week before. 
Races, skillfully planned, usually give enough repeti- 
tions per pupil per minute to be used for drill, but one 
of the most interesting races, namely, the relay race, is an 
exception. 
Relay Race. The pupils are divided into two teams. 
Drill examples of equal difficulty are written on separate 
slips of paper or cards and placed face down on the teach- 
er’s desk in two piles, one for each team. At a given signal 
the first member of each team takes the top card and, 
going to the board, solves the example it contains and 
returns to his seat. As soon as he is seated, the second 
member of the team takes the second card and goes to the 
board, ete. Before solving his own example each con- 
testant has the privilege of correcting mistakes made by 
any previous member of his team. The first team to finish 
all of its examples correctly is the winner. If the team 
that finishes first does not have all the examples correctly 
solved the second team is declared winner, providing they 
have made no mistakes. If both teams have made uncor- 
rected mistakes it is no race. Such a race is intensely 
interesting, and if planned several weeks ahead gives life 
and spirit to drill that might otherwise be deadly dull. 
The holding of an old-fashioned “Ciphering Match” is 
another excellent method of motivating drill. Such a
-P-A-G-E-199
GAMES 193: 
match can take many forms, of which the following is only 
one. 
“Qiphering Match.” The contest may be on just one 
kind of “ciphering,” as addition, or it may involve every- 
thing the pupils have had, including applied problems as 
well as abstract examples. The teacher, or whoever con- 
ducts the match, should have a list of problems and 
examples on separate cards. The first member of Team A 
is given a problem and goes to the board and solves it. 
If he solves it correctly in a given time, say two minutes, 
he takes his seat and another problem is given to the first 
member of Team B; if not, the same problem is given to 
the representative of Team B, and so on until it is solved 
correctly in the given time. Whenever a team member 
fails to solve his problem he is “ciphered out” and with- 
draws from the contest. Problems are giveri alternately 
to the members of the two teams until one team is entirely 
“Ciphered Out.” 
Relay races and “Ciphering Matches” between different 
rooms or different schools or between two chosen teams 
from the same room are both interesting and profitable. 
If the contest is to be between different rooms or schools 
preliminary contests or try-outs should be held in each 
room to choose its representatives. 
Accuracy and Speed. In choosing a game for a given 
purpose one other thing must be considered. No game 
.Should ever be used unless it demands absolute accuracy, 
but some games also put a premium on the speed of the 
response while others demand accuracy only. Each is good 
if used in the proper place, but bad if used in the wrong 
place. When a pupil is first learning a set of facts such 
as the multiplication facts or mastering a new process, as 
carrying in addition, it is disastrous to try to hurry him 
too much, as it will lead to “guessing” and establish incor- 
rect connections and habits that will stand in the way of
-P-A-G-E-200
  194 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
the mastery of the facts or process and lead to mistakes 
and inaccuracies in the future. Games such as “I am 
thinking of two numbers,” “Bean Bag,” “Climb the Lad- 
der,” ete., can be used at this time, but games that demand 
speedy responses, such as “Pussy Wants a Corner,” or a 
race of any kind, are entirely out of place. 
On the other hand, when the facts or process have once 
been fairly mastered, the games used must demand quick- 
ness of response. To use a game at this stage that gives 
the pupil all the time he wants to stop and think before 
he makes a response tends not only to develop habits of 
slow response but also to prevent the mechanization of the 
fact or process by giving the pupil time to think it out. 
Using Games to Create an Interest in Mathematics. 
All of the different types of games help to create an 
interest in arithmetic and mathematics, but mathematical 
puzzles, curiosities and recreations of all kinds are par- 
ticularly good for this purpose. These recreations do not 
usually afford much drill themselves or demand drill in 
order that they may be enjoyed, but they are very valuable 
and should not be neglected. Many a pupil has had his 
first interest in mathematics awakened and stimulated by 
these recreations and through them has discovered a hith- 
erto unsuspected interest in and aptitude for the subject. 
Among the author’s most vivid recollections of his early 
education are the Friday afternoons that his eighth grade 
teacher sometimes devoted to puzzle problems. Many of. 
these recreations are suitable for the intermediate grades 
and many more for the upper grades or the junior high 
school. 
No attempt has been made in this chapter to give an 
extensive list of games. The purpose has been rather to 
make clear the ways in which games can be used to advan- 
tage and the different types of games that are suitable for 
various purposes. For the benefit of teachers who are

  MEASURING THE MASTERY OF THE FUNDA- 
~ MENTAL FACTS AND PROCESSES GAINED 
THROUGH DRILL 
The Problem Is Complex. The measurement of the 
results obtained through drill on the fundamental facts 
and processes of arithmetic is a rather complex problem. 
In 1908 Dr. C. W. Stone* showed that there is no such 
thing as “ability in arithmetic.” Proficiency in the sub- 
ject depends not on any simple ability but rather upon 
a number of specific abilities. His conclusions have been 
corroborated by a number of more recent investigations. 
Even a mastery of one of the fundamental processes 
with integers involves many different abilities. In Chapter 
VI, Part II, the four fundamental processes were ana- 
lyzed, and according to the analyses given there the process 
of addition involves twelve different abilities and habits, 
subtraction eight, multiplication thirteen, and division 
eleven; making in all forty-four abilities and habits neces- 
sary to a mastery of the fundamental processes with inte- 
gers alone. Successful work with fractions and compound 
numbers demands many more, so it is evident that the 
problem of measuring abilities in the fundamental proc- 
esses of arithmetic is a complex one. 
Purpose of Standard Tests. In general, Standard Tests 
are used in two ways: (a) By superintendents and super- 
visors at stated intervals (usually at the beginning, middle 
and end of the year) as a means of judging the effi- 
- eiency of the teaching of arithmetic in a system as a whole

ing Them. aN

ea YH cu, z,

and by the individual teachers. (b) By the class-room 
teacher, at frequent intervals throughout the year, as a 
means of setting a definite standard before the pupils and 
of locating individual and class weaknesses. In this book, 
which is intended for the teacher, only the second of these 
two uses is considered and the Standard Tests are treated 
throughout as a teaching device to be used by the class- 
room teacher. 
The teacher of arithmetic needs to know two things about 
her pupils’ “abilities” in the fundamentals: (1) What 
types of examples they can handle successfully, and (2) 
how well they can handle them; that is, how accurately 
and how rapidly. The teacher needs to know both of these 
things if she is to make her teaching effective. All of 
the following standard tests are designed to enable the 
teacher to find out one or both of these things. 
Courtis Stanparp ResearcH Txsts, Serres A* 
Description. The Courtis Standard Research Tests, 
Series A, consist of eight tests. Only five of these will 
be considered here. Tests Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 are merely 
tests of the pupils’ knowledge of the fundamental facts 
in the four operations of addition, subtraction, multiplica- 
tion, and division, respectively. On each of these tests 
the pupils are given one minute to write answers to as 
many of the combinations as they can. Test No. 7 is 
intended as a test of the pupils’ abilities in the four funda- 
mental processes with integers. The time for this test is 
twelve minutes. The tests follow.

Limitations. By themselves the first four tests measure 
only one of the many abilities involved in the mastery of 
the fundamental processes. A pupil may know his facts 
perfectly and still not be able to solve more complex 
examples, he may know his addition facts and not be able 
to add columns, he may know his multiplication facts and 
not be able to multiply 384 by 6, ete. Because of these 
limitations Test No. 7 and later the four tests of Series B 
were devised to test ability to perform the complete proc- 
esses. The four tests of Series B, described below, are 
more satisfactory for this purpose than Test No. 7 and 
should be used whenever time permits. 
Courtis Stanparp ResEarcuH Tests, Serms B* 
Description. There are four tests in this series, one each 
on addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
Since these tests are intended to measure the pupils’ accur- 
acy and speed in the processes with integers, all of the 
examples in a given test are of the same type and of equal 
difficulty. Thus the number attempted in the given time 
gives the measure of speed and the number correct divided 
by the number attempted gives the per cent of accuracy. 
The tests follow.

Limitations. (a) These tests deal with integers only 
and give no measure of ability with common and decimal 
fractions and with compound ‘numbers. (b) They do not 
give a complete measure of the four processes with integers. 
They determine whether or not a pupil or class is up to 
the standard in solving examples involving all of the dif- 
ferent difficulties occurring in the completed process but 
if the pupil or class is not. up to standard these tests do 
not locate the difficulty. If the pupil has not all of the 
abilities necessary to the successful performance of the 
complete process of addition of integers these tests will not 
determine which he has and which he has not. Even when 
supplemented with Series A these tests are incomplete. 
A pupil might be up to standard on Test 1, Series A (Ad- 
dition combinations), and fail utterly on Test 1, Series B, 
because knowledge of the combinations is only one of the 
many abilities involved in column addition. 
Tue Woopy ARITHMETIC ScALEst 
Description. These scales were recently devised to indi- 
cate “the type of problems and the difficulty of the prob- 
lems that a class can solve correctly.”* There are two 
series of four scales each; Series B is made up of examples 
taken from Series A but contains only half as many 
examples. These scales are fundamentally different from 
the Courtis Tests. Since they are intended to measure 
the type and difficulty of the examples that a class can 
solve correctly, the examples, instead of being of equal 
difficulty, start with the easiest possible example and grad- 
ually increase in difficulty to the last, and instead of all 
being of the same type they are of different types, includ- 
ing integers, common and decimal fractions and compound 
numbers. Twenty minutes is allowed for each of the tests

in Series A. This time is so long that “Most of the chil- 
dren will have finished before that time. Those who do 
not have done, in all probability, all they can; at least 
they have taken as much time as it takes the average class 
to complete the test.”* Thus the element of speed does 
not enter. The score of an individual pupil is a state- 
ment of the particular examples which he has solved 
correctly. The score of a class is the degree of difficulty 
of an example in the scale that is solved correctly by just 
fifty per cent of the class. The relative degree of difficulty 
of the examples has been determined and a value assigned 
to each. The tests of Series A follow.

Limitations. (a) Although the scale is intended to 
determine what types of examples a pupil or class can 
solve it does not include all of the types that occur. Thus 
in addition the only example involving the addition of a 
one and a two-place number is i no examples of the 
more difficult type te being given. (b) There are not 
enough examples of any one type to give a fair test of 
the pupils’ ability to solve examples of that type. Thus 
in the addition scale the pupils’ knowledge of the com- 
binations is tested only by : and 3+1. (c) The scales 
give no test of the pupils’ speed and accuracy in solving 
the different types that they are able to solve correctly. 
The Courtis Standard Research Tests, Series A and 
Series B, together with the Woody Seale, give a fairly 
complete test of ability in the fundamentals. The Woody 
Scale determines what types the pupils can solve, or, what 
is more important, what types they can not solve, while 
the Courtis Tests measure their speed and accuracy in the 
facts and complete processes with integers. Even this 
combination is incomplete, however, as it gives no measure 
of speed in performing the four operations with fractions, 
common and decimal, and with compound numbers.

Limitations. (a) The test does not include sets of ex- 
amples in decimal fractions or compound numbers, there- 
fore gives no measure of the pupils’ mastery of the funda- 
mental processes with these. (b) The number of tests in 
common fractions (two) is entirely inadequate. 
The Monroe Diagnostic Tests 
There are twenty-one tests in this series which “furnish 
a reasonably complete diagnosis of the abilities of pupils 
to do the operations of arithmetic with the exception of 
the types of examples involving mixed numbers and inte- 
gers with fractions.”* The tests are too long to be re- 
printed here. 
Summary 
From the preceding discussion it is seen that either a 
combination of the Courtis Tests with the Woody Scale, 
the Cleveland Survey Tests, or the Monroe Diagnostic 
Tests will enable the teacher to make a fairly complete 
diagnosis of the pupils’ abilities in the four fundamental 
processes. 
Sranparp Practice or Dritt Tests 
The standard tests so far described are not drill devices 
to be used daily but are intended to be used only occa- 
sionally to measure the results of drill work done in other 
ways. Recently there have been published several devices 
for daily drill that in themselves provide definite standards 
of achievement and methods of measuring results and   
*Monroe, W. S—Measuring the Results of Teaching.
-P-A-G-E-229
MEASURING RESULTS 223 
diagnosing difficulties. Among the best of these are the 
Courtis Standard Practice Tests. There are forty-eight 
different cards in the complete set designed to cover all 
types of examples in the four fundamental processes with 
integers. The examples on any one card are all of the 
same type, thus Lesson No. 1 is on addition examples of 
63508 
the type 3, 4; Lesson No. 2 on subtraction of the type 
oh : sa pele 
5 cr ; Lesson No. 3 on multiplication of the type a = 
and Lesson No. 4 on division of the type 1)76, 3)129. 
Each process recurs at intervals, a new difficulty being 
introduced each time until the pupil has mastered all of 
the difficulties involved in the process. The number of 
examples on each card is such that the time for all of the 
cards is the same in a given grade. In the low fourth the 
time allowance is 614 minutes. The first time the tests are’ 
used each pupil is supplied with a copy of Lesson 13, which 
is a test card on addition, subtraction, multiplication and 
division, and covering all of the points involved in the first 
twelve cards. The card is placed under a transparent sheet 
of paper and the pupil writes his results on this paper. 
As a result of this device the cards can be used over and 
over again until worn out. The pupils start at a given 
signal and stop at a signal at the end of the given time. 
Those having perfect papers are excused from the drill 
work on the first twelve lessons and spend their time on 
other work assigned by the teacher. The other pupils, the 
next day, start on Lesson No. 1, and repeat it each day 
until they get all of the examples correct in the given time, 
when théy go on to No. 2, ete. 
A drill device such as this, possesses many advantages. 
(1) Provides for individual differences; each pupil gets 
the amount of drill necessary on each card to bring him 
> 
we y ~
-P-A-G-E-230
224 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
to the standard and no more. As the time allowance is 
the same for all cards different pupils can be working on 
different cards at the same time. (2) Prevents waste of 
time by unnecessary drill. When a pupil completes all of 
the cards for his grade he devotes his time to something 
else. (3) Diagnoses difficulties of class and individuals. 
Because of the careful analysis and separation of diffi- 
culties the teacher is enabled to locate and overcome weak- 
nesses exposed by the tests. 
The Studebaker Economy Practice Exercises in Arith- 
metic are similar to the Courtis Practice Tests and so will 
not be described here. 
Stranparp ScorEs 
The Median. In most cases the standard scores here 
given are median scores. The median is a measure of a 
class or group somewhat similar to but differing from the 
average. It is the middle score, the score that just as many 
pupils exceed as fall below. If in a class of seven pupils 
the individual scores on the Courtis Test in Addition, 
Series B, were 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, and 20, respectively, the 
median score would be 7, as three pupils solve more and 
three less than this number of examples. The median is 
usually taken as the measure of the class rather than the 
average, because it is easier to figure and is more typical 
of the group as a whole, as it is less affected by extremely 
good or bad scores. Thus in the class given above the 
median is 7, while the average is 8%. The median is more 
typical of the class than the average, which is unduly 
influenced by the one exceptionally good score of 20. 
The median scores here given do not necessarily indicate 
what a pupil should be able to do, or what he néeds to be 
able to do in order to get along in this world. Being 
derived from results actually obtained in our schools they 
simply indicate the results of our present teaching. It is 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
MEASURING RESULTS 225 
possible that these results might be improved by better 
teaching: Ultimately we should have standards based upon 
what the world demands, but until we get such, the stand- 
ards we have, based upon present results, are much better 
than none at all.

*Speed. **Per cent accuracy. 
Speed is the number of examples done in a given time. 
Accuracy is obtained by dividing the number correct by 
the number attempted. The upper figure in each case is 
the median score based upon “many thousands of indi- 
vidual scores in tests given May or June, 1915-16.” The 
lower figure is the standard proposed by Courtis after 
three years’ use of these tests. 
Woopy ScaLe 
The Woody Scale is too recent for any standards to be 
available. 
The following tentative standards are proposed by Mr. 
Woody, based on actual achievements of the children tested 
with the preliminary tests that were used in deriving the 
scale as it now stands. As already indicated, the examples
-P-A-G-E-233
  
MEASURING RESULTS 227 
in each scale are of unequal difficulty and the relative 
difficulty or “value” of each example was determined by 
Mr. Woody and is given in the following table:

The score of the class is taken as the degree of difficulty 
which an example must possess to be correctly solved by 
just 50 per cent of the class. The following table gives the 
tentative standards proposed by Mr. Woody.

These standards give the degree of difficulty that an 
example must possess in order that just 50 per cent of the 
class can solve it correctly. Thus, if a problem in addition
-P-A-G-E-235
  MEASURING RESULTS 229 
has 3.12 units of difficulty it should be solved by 50 per 
cent of the second grade; if it has 4.99 units of difficulty 
it should be solved by 50 per cent of the third grade, ete. 
CLEVELAND-SuRVEY TESTS 
There are no standards available as yet for these tests. 
They have been given, however, in Cleveland, Grand Rap- 
ids and St. Louis and the median scores from these cities, 
although they should not be regarded as standards, give 
some idea of the results we can expect to obtain. 
Cleveland-Survey Tests. Cleveland and Grand Rapids 
Scores (Median Number of Examples Correct) 
The upper number in each case is the median score 
obtained in Cleveland, the lower number the median ob- 
tained in Grand Rapids. In all cases the medians are for 
the lower half of the grades.

urpose. Important as it is, the mechanical mastery of 
the fundamental facts and processes is not the ultimate 
end of arithmetical instruction but only a means to that 
/ end. The ultimate aim is to prepare the boys and girls 
/ for life, and life demands not only a perfect mastery of 
the fundamentals of arithmetic but also the ability to 
apply these fundamentals successfully to actual life situ- 
ations. No matter what the pupil’s life work may be, 
farming, business, home-making, teaching, a mechanical 
trade, engineering, the law, or medicine, it will present 
situations having a numerical side, and + is the duty of 
the school to prepare its pupils to meet such situations 
successfully. In order to do this these life situations, or 
their descriptions, are brought into the school and consti- 
tute the applied problems of arithmetic. The chief purpose 
of these problems is to prepare the pupils to solve the 
problems they may meet in life. There are two ways in 
which we might try to do this. (1) Give direct preparation 
for the kinds of problems the pupils will meet in life, 
3 pad (2) Give general preparation for all ne of problems.

PURPOSE OF PROBLEM WORK is) 
Direct PREPARATION FOR THE Kinps oF PROBLEMS THE 
Pourits Witt Meer 
In order to give direct preparation for the kinds of 
problems that the pupils will meet in life it would be 
necessary to look ahead and to make a collection of all of 
the different types of these problems. Having done this 
the pupils could be given a rule or a type solution for 
each of these types and drilled in using it until they could 
solve all such problems mechanically without having to 
stop and think them out. This would be the surest method 
of preparing the pupils to solve the problems they will 
meet in life if it were possible. The only trouble with it 
is that it is not possible for several reasons: 
In the first place no one can foresee what types of 
problems the pupils of a given class are going to meet in 
their lives. This will depend largely on the character of 
their life work and no one can predict what that will be. 
Even in a rural, agricultural community it is not safe to 
presume that the boys are all going to be farmers and 
the girls farmers’ wives. Even if the teacher knows the 
lines of work in which her pupils will engage it is not 
always possible to predict the kind of problems they will 
have to solve. Conditions in-any given field of work are 
constantly changing and these changes often take place in a 
short time and are revolutionary in character. The arith- 
metic of business ten years from today may be quite dif- 
ferent from what it is today. 
In the second place it is not possible to classify all of 
the problems that occur in life according to a few types 
and to formulate rules or type solutions for each. In- 
deed, it may almost be said that in order to have enough 
types to “go around” there would have to be as many types 
as there are indiyirimal problems. It is not possible to 
prepare the pupils directly for ali of the types of proh- 
{ \ 
: } 
{  
-P-A-G-E-240
  | 
234 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
lems they may meet in life. Even if the schools could teach 
enough types they would not have sufficient time to drill 
on them and fix them permanently in the pupils’ minds, 
and as a result they would certainly be forgotten in a few 
days, months or years. } 
Another difficulty arises in recognizing the rule or type 
solution to be applied to a given problem. Confronted by 
an arithmetical situation in life the pupil might fail utterly, 
not because he had never been taught the proper solution, 
not because he had forgotten it, but simply because he 
could not tell which of his various rules or type solutions 
to apply to this particular problem. 
Conclusions. The teacher who relies on rules and type 
solutions to enable her pupils to solve the arithmetical 
problems of life is pre-doomed to failure, she can not pos- 
sibly teach enough types to cover all of the problems her 
pupils will meet, she has not sufficient time to make certain 
that the pupils will retain the types she does teach, and 
there is always the danger that the pupils will apply the 
wrong type to a given problem. In spite of the utter 
futility and hopelessness of solving problems by rule or 
type solution many teachers consciously or unconsciously 
use the method. As a result many, if not the majority, 
of the pupils graduated from the grades, when they meet 
an arithmetical problem, try to remember how they worked 
problems of that kind in school. If they forget or never 
worked a problem similar to the given ties are utterly 
lost. Such pupils have no mastery over problems in gen- 
eral and are very poorly prepared for their life work, 
whatever it may be. 
GerNERAL PREPARATION FoR ALL Kinps or PropLEMs 
Although many high school and college students can 
solve only those types of~applied ~_‘olem’ in arithmetic 
that they have been taught to solve in the grades, there are 
La ys
-P-A-G-E-241
PURPOSE OF PROBLEM WORK 235 
many others who can solve almost any problem of a 
reasonable degree of complexity. Upon investigation it 
will usually be found that these students attack a problem 
in an entirely different way; instead of trying to remember 
how the teacher or the book solved a problem like the 
given one yesterday or the day before, or how they them- 
selves worked similar problems at some previous time, 
they size up the given problem on its own merits, get 
clearly in mind the relations that exist between the various 
quantities involved and think out the solution in terms 
of these relations. These students have developed the 
power to successfully cope with any kind of an arithmetical 
situation they may encounter in life and the school can 
develop this same. power in all or at least the majority of 
the pupils in the same way that it was developed in these 
students. 
2 ath of problems involves the ability to plan the solu- 
tioh as well as the ability to execute the plan successfully. 
This ability to plan the solution does not come through the 
blind following of rules or directions; it can only come 
from meeting many different kinds of problems and reason- 
ing each through in terms of the relationships involved. ) 
Probably everyone has had experience with some work- 
man who could do fairly good work as long as some one 
told him what to do, but was totally unable to go ahead for 
himself—who had never formed the habit of thinking and 
planning for himself but relied on others for directions. 
The pupil who relies on type solutions and rules in arith- 
metic is in the same condition as this workman and will - 
never get a real mastery over problems until he forms the 
‘habit of thinking and planning them out for himself. 
By thoughtfully solving. a variety of problems beginning 
with the easiest the power to think out other and more 
difficult problems is gradually developed. If the teacher 
has her pupils think out each problem as it occurs the 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
  236 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
majority of them will eventually develop power over prob- 
lems in general and will be well equipped for the problems 
they will meet in life. When the pupil solves a problem 
by mechanically following some set of directions or type 
solution he gets nothing but the answer to that particular 
problem; but every time he reasons out a problem he not 
only gets the result to that particular problem but adds 
to his power to reason out other problems. In order to 
realize the social aim of arithmetic the fundamental facts 
and processes must be mechanized from the first but the 
solution of problems must always be thoughtful and not 
mechanical. To let the solution of problems become me- 
chanical and to let the work with the fundamentals become 
thoughtful are equally bad; either will defeat the ends 
sought. 
Only one exception need be made to this general propo- 
sition. If a certain type of problem is of such common 
and frequent occurrence in life that all of the pupils are 
sure to meet it frequently then the teacher is justified in 
formulating a rule and mechanizing its solution. If this 
is done, however, she must provide sufficient drill, spread 
over a sufficient interval of time to insure permanent reten- 
tion. An example of this kind is found in simple interest. 
This particular application of arithmetic occurs so fre- 
quently in the lives of most people that the schools should 
reduce the figuring of simple interest to a mechanical basis 
and drill on it for several years (at least from the sixth 
to the eighth grade) to insure its retention. 
It may be thought by some that teachers no longer teach 
their pupils to solve problems by rule. A little observation 
in almost any school system is sufficient, however, to con- 
vince the most skeptical that there are still many teachers 
who do so, consciously or unconsciously. ne teachers 
apparently have no aim in problem work beyond teaching 
in such a way as to enable their pupils to solve the prob-
-P-A-G-E-243
  
PURPOSE OF PROBLEM WORK 237 
lems in the a and the easiest way to accomplish this 
end is to give a rule or type solution. The author has seen 
many examples of this sort of problem work within the 
last five years. The worst was a recitation given in a 
seventh grade. The pupils had been assigned a list of 
ten applied problems in proportion as home work and at 
the beginning of the period the teacher had the solutions 
of those problems written on the board. The first problem 
was, “If A has $1200 invested in a certain business and 
receives a profit of $130 at the end of the year, what profit 
should B receive if he has $750 invested in the same busi- 
ness?” The pupil’s solution of this problem as written on 
the board was as follows: 
$1200 : $750 :: $130: a. 
25 
$730x$130 325 = === =$76.75 B’ fit. 
gi Pe 4 
After the solutions had all been written on the board 
the pupils proceeded to explain them. The first problem 
was explained as follows, partly by the pupil himself and 
partly in response to the teacher’s questions, “The quan- 
tity to be found is the number of dollars of B’s profit, the 
quantity having the same name is $130 the number of 
dollars of A’s profit, so we place $130 in the third term of 
our proportion. B’s profit will be smaller than A’s because 
he has less money invested so we place the smaller of the 
other two quantities, $750, in the second term of our pro- 
portion and the larger, $1200, in the first term. Then x 
is the second term multiplied by the third and divided by 
the first. So # equals $750 times $130 over $1200 or $76.75 
B’s profit. All of the other problems were explained in 
the same way. It was evident before the recitation was 
half over that the pupils were solving the problems by 
applying the following rule which they had evidently
-P-A-G-E-244
    
238 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
memorized. Rule: Place the quantity having the same 
name as the quantity to be found in the third term and 
the quantity to be found or x in the fourth. Then, if the 
quantity to be found is to be larger than the quantity in 
the third term, place the larger of the other two quantities 
in the second term and the smaller in the first; but, if the 
quantity to be found is smaller than the quantity in the 
third term, place the smaller of the other two quantities 
in the second term and the larger in the first. Then 2, or 
the quantity to be found, will be equal to the product of 
the second and third terms divided by the first.* 
Other problems were then solved in class. The first te 
was always to put down the dots as follows 
Then, if the pupils had difficulty, the teacher Helped them | 
by asking “What do we always put in the fourth term?” 
(Ans. x),-“What do we put in the third term?” (Ans. 
The quantity that has the same name as the quantity we 
want to find), ete. In this way they proceeded to fill in 
the holes between the dots until they had built up the 
proportion. ; 
If the sole purpose of this recitation was to enable the 
pupils to solve the problems in proportion in their text it 
was entirely successful. They solved all of the problems 
without any serious difficulty. But if the purpose of the 
recitation was to enable the pupils to use proportion as a 
tool in solving problems in after life it was an absolute 
failure. 
Not a single pupil in the class had any idea of what 
a proportion is, not one of them had any understanding 
of the relationship existing between the four quantities 
involved, and as a result not one of them would recognize 
a situation in life that could be solved by means of pro- 
portion. They only knew that these problems were to be 
*A similar rule is found in all of our old arithmetics and is known 
as the “Rule of Three.” It is an earlier form of proportion.

PURPOSE OF PROBLEM WORK 239 
solved by this particular rule because the book or eaters 
said so. If proportion is worth teaching at all the impor- 
tant thing that the pupils must get is a grasp of the 
relationships involved. If they get this they will recognize 
a situation in which they can use proportion when they 
meet it and will not need a rule to enable them to build up 
the proportion. In the problem given above, if it is solved 
by proportion, the important thing is for the pupils to see 
that B’s profit will bear the same relation to his investment, 
as A’s profit bears to A’s investment; or that B’s profit 
will bear the same relation to A’s profit as B’s investment 
bears to A’s investment. Seeing these relations the pupils 
ean form the proportion without the aid of a rule.

  CHAPTER II 
THE NATURE AND SOURCES OF PROBLEMS 
Essentials of Good Problems. The three most import- 
tant requirements to be satisfied by problems are (1) They 
must be conerete to the pupils; (2) They must be typical 
of real life, and (3) They must be varied. 
Prostems Must Bre ConcreTe To THE PUPILS 
The first requirement for any problem is that it be con- 
erete to the pupils who try to solve it, that is, it must be 
about things and situations that come within the pupils’ 
own experience and consequently mean something to and 
are understood by them. Unless this is true the pupils can 
not think through the situation and are driven to some 
mechanical method of solution. Even an adult can not suc- 
cessfully think through a situation foreign to his expe- 
rience. This is illustrated by the following account by a 
normal school teacher: “I was trying to explain to a 
teacher of several years’ experience that the quotient of 
the length of a row, divided by the distance between plants, 
did not give the number of plants in the row. * * * 
After I had exhausted my stock of word pictures, I took 
a pencil and began a diagram, when the teacher to whom 
I was explaining the problem, exclaimed: ‘Oh, I see it. 
It is just like hanging handkerchiefs on a clothesline; it 
takes one more clothespin than there are handkerchiefs.’ ”* 
The two situations were geometrically identical, but the 
teacher could not visualize the situation “plants in a row” 
and could visualize “handkerchiefs on a clothesline” be- 
  
*Quoted by Dr. J. F. Millis in “The Solution of Problems in 
Arithmetic.” (Pamphlet.) 
240
-P-A-G-E-247
  
NATURE AND SOURCES OF ‘PROBLEMS 241 
cause she had had experience with the one situation and 
had not with the other. Several years ago in a class in 
solid geometry the author assigned a list of applied prob- 
lems on the volume of the cone. Several members of the 
class failed to solve one of the problems, although it was 
no more difficult than the rest, simply because the dimen- 
sions were given in centimeters’ whereas in the other prob- 
lems they were given in feet and inches. In this school 
solid geometry was taught in the third year and physics 
in the fourth and‘some of the pupils did not know what 
centimeter meant and this unfamiliar element was suffi- 
cient to prevent them solving the problem. Jf the pupils 
are to think through a problem the situation involved must 
be concrete to them so that they can image the relationships 
between the quantities. It must be remembered that a 
problem is not necessarily concrete just because it has to 
do with concrete things. Indeed “concreteness” is not an 
intrinsic quality, a quality inherent in the problem itself. 
A given problem may be concrete to one pupil and not to 
another according to the pupils’ individual experience. 
A problem has been defined as (1) an actual life situ- 
ation having an arithmetical side; or (2) the description 
of such a situation. There are thus two types of problems. 
To illustrate these take the situation or problem of finding 
the number of board feet in a pile of lumber. This might 
be presented to the pupils by taking them to the manual 
training department or to a lumber yard, showing them a 
pile of lumber and telling them to find the number of board 
feet in the pile. Or it might be presented to them in words 
as follows: “A pile of lumber contains ten pieces 2”4” 
X10’; five pieces 2”><6” X10’; and twenty pieces 1” 
5”><10’. Find the number of board feet in the pile.” 
Actual Life Situations. The problem met as an actual 
life situation is both harder and easier than the problem 
met in words. It is easier because it is more concrete  
-P-A-G-E-248
  242 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
and so it is easier for the pupils to see the relation of the 
various quantities involved. It is harder because the suc- 
cessful meeting of the life situation involves an element 
not encountered in the situation described in words. In 
the one case the required data is given and all the pupils 
have to do is to determine how to make use of this infor- 
mation, in the other case the data is not given and the 
pupils must first decide what information or data they 
will need and must then get that data for themselves. LIt 
follows, therefore, that the pupils can not develop the 
ability to apply their arithmetic to actual life situations 
by applying it to the descriptions of such situations. 
Ideally all of the problems of arithmetic should be met by 
the pupils as actual life situations.\ In actual practice we 
may never reach this ideal but at least we can see to it 
that the pupils meet many problems in this way and 
when for any reason the teacher must use the description 
of an actual life situation she should realize that it is only 
at best a very poor substitute for the real situation istelf. 
Several illustrations of problems met as actual life situa- 
tions follow: (1) Keeping a personal account of all re- 
ceipts and expenditures. Each pupil keeps an account of 
all of the money he receives, giving date and source, and 
of all he spends, giving date and what it was spent for. 
Every week he balances his accounts. (2) Keeping books 
for a paper route. If any of the boys carry papers they 
can be shown how to keep a simple set of books. (3) 
Painting a room. Each pupil imagines that he is a painter 
and bids for the job of painting the school room. To do 
this the pupils must first take their own measurements, 
find out how much surface a gallon of the desired paint 
will cover and the cost per gallon, and figure out the total 
cost of the paint required. They must also find out about 
how long it would take a painter to do the job and the 
cost per hour for his labor, figuring the total cost of labor.
-P-A-G-E-249
  NATURE AND SOURCES OF PROGBLEMS 243 
Descriptions of Life Situations. In the past most of the 
problems we have used have been taken from books or 
have been made up by the teacher and presented to the 
pupils i words. At best such problems are but the de- 
seriptions of actual life situations and at their worst they 
are the descriptions of hypothetical situations such as never 
did and never could occur in life. 
(Many of the graduates of our elementary and high 
schools today can solve book problems but are utterly 
unable to solve the problems they meet in life, largely 
because book problems are the only kind they have ever 
met in their school work) As an illustration of this the 
author in his work with normal college students finds that 
a large per cent of them can not find the area of a triangle. 
To be sure, if they are given the problem, “The base of a 
triangle is 3’ 6” and the altitude 2’ 8”. Find the area,” 
they can solve it, but if they are given a triangular piece 
of cardboard or taken to a triangular field and asked to 
find the area many of them are at a total loss how to pro- 
ceed. 
Perhaps one of the weakest points in much of our school 
work is its artificiality, its abstractness. Every one has 
heard of the teacher in a Mississippi River town whose 
pupils studied about the Mississippi River in their geogra- 
phies and never once connected it with the river they saw 
every day. This teacher was no worse than the arithmetic 
teacher who teaches the text book problems on Papering 
and never has the pupils measure a\room and estimate the 
paper required, who teaches Stocks and Bonds without 
the pupils ever getting a clear idea of either or of the 
difference between the two, who teaches Taxes from the 
book and never considers the local situation, or the teacher 
who teaches Commercial Discount without considering the 
discount sales held in the local stores and advertised in the 
local papers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  
244 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Probably the time will never come when the pupils will 
meet all of their problems in the form of actual, concrete, 
life situations. The teacher will always have to present 
many of the problems in words but should realize the weak- 
nesses of such problems. Too often the words of the prob- 
lem are mere words and convey no idea to the pupils, call 
up no concrete images in their minds. Teachers too often 
permit pupils to deal with mere words without making 
sure that the correct idea is behind the words. They are 
apt to have too great faith in words, forgetting that they 
often convey no idea, or entirely the wrong idea to the 
pupils. The successful teacher must learn to be exceedingly 
suspicious of words and use every possible means to make 
sure that the words convey the proper idea to the pupils. 
Problems Made by the Pupils and Teacher. Many of 
the problems used in arithmetic should be made up by the 
pupils themselves and others should be made up by the 
teacher. » Such problems can be made concrete by basing 
them ow (1) Things the pupils are doing in school, (2) 
Things the pupils are doing outside of school, and (3) 
Community activities which either are familiar or can 
easily be made familiar to the_pupils. 
oblems Based on Wied eerie: Are Doing in 
School. In every school, from the first grade to the eighth, 
the pupils are constantly having experiences and meeting 
situations that should be made the basis of problems for 
arithmetic. Many teachers are utterly blind to these op- 
portunities and teach arithmetic in the arithmetic period 
and forget all about it at other times. The author once 
visited a first grade and saw the teacher direct the pupils 
to a certain page in their primers by holding the open 
book before them, pointing to a picture on the opposite 
page and having the pupils leaf through the book until 
they found the picture. It afterwards developed that this
-P-A-G-E-251

NATURE AND SOURCES OF PROBLEMS 245 
teacher was teaching the pupils their numbers, but she had 
a separate number period for this. 
The opportunities for problems may arise in connection 
with (1) the other subjects studied, (2) the routine of the 
school, (3) the games and other activities at recess, or 
(4) some of the special activities of the school. Reading, 
Language, Spelling, Nature Study, Industrial Arts, Home 
Economics, Agriculture, History and Geography all pre- 
sent situations having a numerical or quantitative side 
that can be made the basis of many interesting problems 
by a wide awake teacher and class. The routine of the 
school affords many more opportunities such as passing, 
collecting and taking care of material used, the keeping of 
a temperature chart of the room and the keeping of absence 
and tardy records. The keeping of scores in games and the 
laying out of a playground, or a baseball diamond are 
examples of problems arising in connection with the play 
activities of the school. The planning and financing of 
school entertainments, corn clubs, pig-growing contests and 
home credit work of all kinds also lead to many problems. 
Problems Based on What the Pupils Are Doing Outside 
Faw. Besides knowing what the pupils are doing in 
connection with their school work the teacher should have 
some knowledge of what they are doing outside. The city 
boy may have a paper route, or be selling the Saturday 
Evening Post; the country boy may be farming an acre 
+ on his owx account or raising a pig. With only a little 
encouragement the pupils will bring problems arising from 
these and other outside activities to the arithmetic class. 
Problems Based on Community Activities. In making 
problems the teacher does not need to confine herself to 
what the pupils are actually doing themselves. In any 
community at any time there are many things going on 
that can easily be brought within the pupils’ experience 
and understanding and that make good problem material.

In the country there are such things as agriculture (the 
chief occupation of the community), good roads, local 
finances and taxes, school finances, size of crops, per cent 
of increase and decrease in acreage devoted to various crops, 
per cent of increase and decrease in amount of various 
crops, market quotations on farm crops and produce, ete. 
In the city the field is also limitless, including study of 
important local industries, local finances and taxes, school 
finances, improvement of streets, civic improvements of 
all kinds, sales held at local stores, ete. 
Text Book Problems May be Localized. In making up 
problems the teacher will often find the problems in some 
modern text very suggestive. Thus, one of our recent 
arithmetics has a list of problems on “Planning Journeys.” 
The author happened to see recently two different recita- 
tions based on this list of problems. The first teacher had 
assigned the problems just as they were in the book. The 
second teacher had taken the idea and made up other 
problems similar to those in the book but based on local 
conditions. For example, the second problem in the book 
was, “A single ticket between two places 79 miles apart 
costs $1.80; the round-trip ticket $3.00. How much is 
saved on the round trip by buying the round-trip ticket 
instead of two single tickets?” The second teacher had in 
making the assignment the previous day proposed a similar 
problem to her class, namely how much would they save on 
a trip to Toledo (the nearest large city) by buying a round- 
trip ticket. The pupils first obtained the required infor- 
mation from the local ticket office and then solved the 
problem. Both of these recitations were very good, but of 
the two the second was much more interesting to the pupils 
and undoubtedly meant much more to them. 
Text Book Problems. Although many of the problems 
should/ be met by the pupils in the form of actual life 
situations and many others should be made up by the
-P-A-G-E-253
NATURE AND SOURCES OF PROBLEMS 247° 
pupils themselves and the teacher, yet in most schools the 
chief source of problems must always be the text book. 
The chief objection to the text book problem as such is 
that it is apt to lack concreteness. A text book is not 
written for any particular class, for any one town or even 
for any one state. On the contrary it is written for the 
whole country and usually for the city school as well as 
the country school. The result is that any text book con: 
tains some problems that are concrete to a particular 
class of pupils, others that can easily be made concrete and 
still others that can not possibly be made concrete to that 
class. The first will give no trouble and the last must be 
omitted entirely; the teacher’s chief problem is with the 
second group, namely, those that are not concrete to the 
pupils but can be made so. 
Preliminary Discussion and Explanation. The teacher’s 
first duty in using text book problems is to see that each 
problem is concrete to her pupils, that the words of the 
problem call up in the pupils’ minds the correct ideas and 
images. Sometimes all that is necessary is a brief discus- 
sion of the situations involved in the problems when making 
the assignment. The author recently visited a ‘sixth grade 
class that was working with a list of problems in their 
text based on school athletics. One of the problems intro- 
duced the term “High School Athletic Association,” and as 
many of the pupils did not know the meaning of this they 
were not able to solve the problem. The teacher had one 
of the pupils who did know what was meant by a High 
School Athletic Association explain to the others, who then 
had no further difficulty. 
Dramatization. Sometimés the best way to make a 
problem or group of problems concrete is to dramatize the 
situation involved. Many of the simple problems of the 
primary grades are based on buying things because this 
is at the same time one of the“earliest, most common and  
-P-A-G-E-254
  
; i ; 
248 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
most important applications of arithmetic. Many of the 
pupils, particularly in the villages and towns, will have 
had actual experience in buying things at stores or will at 
least have accompanied their parents. To amplify this 
experience and make sure that it is a common possession 
of all the pupils is the purpose of Playing Store in school. 
It is not necessary to play store every day, but by devoting- 
one period a week, or every two weeks, to the store the 
teacher can make sure that the pupils are provided with a 
concrete basis for problem work on the other days. 
Many problems and lists of problems in our newer 
arithmetics lend themselves readily to dramatization. 
Thus, in one arithmetic intended for the third grade there 
are lists of problems on “Going to Grocery for Mother,” 
“The Three Bears,” “Ned and His Rabbits,” “Little Bo- 
Peep, » “The Doll Party,” ete., and in another book in- 
tended for the same grade are problems on “Playing 
School,” “Playing Postman,” “Buying Toys,” “Playing 
Clerk,” ete., all of which can be made concrete by dramati- 
zation. 
Although it will probably be necessary to resort to 
dramatization more frequently in the lower grades than in 
the upper, this is not because it is less effective in the 
upper grades but simply because the pupils in these grades 
have a larger body of knowledge and experience. Dram- 
atization should be used even in the upper grades when 
dealing with problems based on situations foreign to the 
children’s experience. Ideally, perhaps, it might be better 
to wait until the pupils get the experience before giving 
them the problems; but there are some of the most im- 
portant applications of arithmetic particularly to business 
that the pupils must get in the upper grades or they will 
not get them at all. The ideal place to teach the business 
applications of arithmetic such as interest, bank discount, 
commercial discount, figuring profits in a business, stocks
-P-A-G-E-255
  
NATURE AND SOURCES OF PROBLEMS 249 
and. bonds, taxes, insurance, etc., would be the senior year 
of the high school or college, as the students would then 
have greater business experience as a basis for the work 
and would also have occasion to use the knowledge gained 
at’ once. Most of our pupils, however, never get beyond 
the elementary school and must get this knowledge there 
or not at all. This makes it necessary for the teacher 
to first supply the concrete experience necessary to an 
understanding of these business applications of arithmetic 
and the best way to do this in many cases is by dramatizing 
the situations. As an illustration, in many schools the 
pupils form a school bank, open accounts, make deposits, 
write checks, borrow money, make out notes, figure inter- 
est and discount notes. This is not only the most effective 
but also the easiest and quickest way of giving the pupils 
an insight into these topics. 
Unified Lists of Problems. In our older text books the 
problems were usually organized according to the arith- 
metic involved. Thus, there is a list of problems on 
addition, another on subtraction, still another on com- 
mon fractions, ete. Most of the newer books have many 
of their problems organized in a different way, the unity 
in a given list of problems instead of being arithmetical is 
social, that is, in a list of problems the arithmetic may 
be varied but the problems are all based on the same social 
or life situation. Thus, we find lists of problems on “EKarn- 
ing Money,” “Sending Money by Mail,” “Paying House- 
hold expenses,” ‘Household Supplies,” “Cooking” and 
“Sewing.” 
Such an organization has two decided advantages. In 
the first place it is true to life. The problems met by a 
grocer in his work are not all addition problems one day, 
and subtraction the next, instead on any one day they 
may be quite varied as to the arithmetic involved but are 
all connected in that they all arise from the business of
-P-A-G-E-256
250 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
managing a grocery store. In the second place it is much 
easier to make problems that are grouped around a single 
social situation concrete to the pupils. If a list of ten 
problems involves ten entirely different situations, none 
of them concrete to the pupils, it would take too much 
time to explain each of the ten situations, but if the ten 
problems all have the same social setting, time can be 
taken to study this social situation with the pupils pa 
even to dramatize it if necessary. 
Life Problems. Since the whole purpose of solving 
arithmetical problems in school is to develop the ability to 
solve the arithmetical problems of life it follows that the 
problems in school must be of the same kind as the pol 
lems of life. Under the domination of the old disciplinar 
conception of arithmetical instruction the problems of ow 
arithmetics were largely of the puzzle type and any prob- 
lem was considered satisfactory if it involved the require 
number relations regardless of whether or not it eve 
occurred in life. In the past in writing a text book on 
arithmetic the author got his problems not from a study of 
life but from other arithmeties. As a result our arith- 
metices of ten years ago were full of problems inherite 
from past ages, many of which never did occur in actual 
life and many others that were once life problems but 
had long been obsolete. 
Within recent years several series of arithmetics have 
appeared that have been written in an entirely different 
way. The authors instead of going to other books for 
their problems enlisted the co-operation of men engaged 
in many different lines of work and with their assistan 
collected problems that actually occur in life work. as 
already pointed out, it is impossible to bring all of t 
different types of problems that occur in life into the 
school, but we can at least bring in the most important 
types, those frequently met by the ordinary man; and 
   
-P-A-G-E-257
  
  NATURE AND SOURCES OF PROBLEMS 251 
we are certainly not justified in using problems that never 
occur in life or that are met only by the specialist in some 
particular line of work. 
The term “practical problem” has been so much abused 
that it is meaningless. Many texts boast of their practical 
problems because they have lists of problems on “Farm- 
ing,” “Cooking,” and “Profit and Loss,” but a careful study 
of these problems will often show that the farming prob- 
lems were never met by any farmer, the cooking problems 
by any cook, or the profit and loss problem by any business 
man. To be practical in the true sense of the word a 
problem must not only be about some practical line of 
work, but must be the kind of problem that actually occurs 
and must be solved by those engaged in that work. 
The following problems taken from text books in com- 
mon use today have to do with practical situations but 
are not the kind of problems that actually occur in life. 
1. A dealer bought 50 gross of buttons for 25%, 10%, 
5% off and sold them for $35.91 making a profit of 12%. 
What was the list price of the buttons per gross? 
2. Mr. Day’s city tax, at the rate of 13 mills on the 
dollar, is $84.50. What is the estimated value of his prop- 
erty, if it is assessed at % of its value? 
3. A merchant sold silk at 45 cents a yard above cost, 
and gained 20%. What was selling price per yard? 
4. A man rented a field to a tenant in return for 334% 
of the grain to be raised. The owner of the field sold his 
share of the grain for 80¢ a bushel, receiving $240. How 
many bushels did he have, and how many bushels did the 
tenant have? 
Data. Not only should the problems be of types that 
actually occur but the data involved in the problems should 
be true to actual conditions. A problem about butter at 
25¢ a pound or shoes at $2.50 a pair is ridiculous and mis- 
leading when butter is selling on the local market at 68) 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  252 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
and shoes at not less than $5. In using text book problems 
of this kind the teacher and pupils should change the data 
given to conform to local market conditions. 
Problems With Extraneous Data. As has been pre- 
viously stated, one way in which the school problem differs 
from the actual life situation is in the fact that the schoo. 
problem gives the pupils all of the necessary data, wheres 
in the actual life situation they must first obtain their own 
data. Further, the text-book problem usually gives only 
the data necessary for its solution, whereas in the life 
situation the pupils must often choose from a lot of things 
that they know or can find out about the situation, those 
facts or items of data that are necessary for their particular 
purpose. The school-room problem can be made more 
nearly like the actual life situation by introducing data 
not necessary for its solution. For this reason, problems 
with unnecessary or extraneous data should occasionally 
be given. Such problems make it necessary for the pupils 
to exercise their own judgment in selecting, from-all of the 
data given, that necessary to the solution of the problem. 
Statement. If the problem is to be interesting and to 
seem worth while to the pupils it must be stated in such 
way as to show how it arises, who has to solve it, and 
why it needs to be solved. Many of the problems in our 
texts are absolutely pointless. The following problems are 
examples. 
1. If you have 7¢ how many cents must you get to have 
10¢? 
2. If you have 8 pieces of candy and divide them into 
two equal piles how many pieces will there be in each pile? 
3. Find the marked price of a chair if the net price is 
$17 and there is a discount of 5% of the marked price. 
These problems as stated are dead and uninteresting 
and apparently have no reason for existing. Properly 
stated, however, they become real problems. 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  
NATURE AND SOURCES OF PROBLEMS 253 
1. If you have 7¢ in your bank and want to buy a ball 
that costs 10¢, how many more cents must you save? 
2. If you have 8 pieces of candy and share them equally 
with your sister, how many pieces will each of you have? 
3. If a retail dealer allows a 5% discount from the 
marked price for cash, what will he have to mark a chair 
in order to receive a cash price of $17? 
Method of Solution. Finally the problems in arithmetic 
should be solved in the way they are solved in life. If 
business men figure profits as a per cent of the sales, the 
school should not figure them as a per cent of the cost; if 
the paper hanger uses one method of determining the 
amount of paper needed for a room the pupils in school 
should not use another method. 
Mental Training. Some people argue that the pupils get 
just as much training from solving artificial problems in 
artificial ways as they do from solving life problems as they 
are solved in life. The argument should be turned around: 
they get just as much training from solving life prob- 
lems, and besides are having experience with the kind of 
problems that they are going to meet in life, and are not 
only developing power to work such problems but are 
at the same time getting an insight into actual life condi- 
tions. The boy who solves problems in school of the type 
“a merchant bought an article for $10 and sold it for $15. 
Find the per cent of profit” gets just as much training 
perhaps as the boy who solves problems of the type (a 
furniture dealer’s cost of doing business is 20% of his sales. 
At what must he sell a table that costs him $20 in order to 
make a net profit of 10% of the selling price?} but the first 
boy is apt to leave: school with the impression that a 
merchant first buys an article, sells it, and then stops to 
figure profits; while the second boy learns that a merchant 
must do his figuring before he sells the article and often 
before he buys it. Preparation for life demands that we
-P-A-G-E-260
  254 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
give our pupils experience with and insight into the most 
important and common life situations involving simple 
arithmetic. If we do this we will have no time to spend 
on types of problems that exist nowhere except in our 
text books. 
The Teacher. Proper teaching of problems is impossible 
unless the teacher looks upon knowledge of the common 
activities of life as just as important as knowledge of subject 
matter, methods and books.) Sociology—real sociology, not 
book sociology—is a moré important part of a teacher’s 
equipment than psychology. Until the teacher has al 
least an elementary knowledge of the life situations upon 
which the school situations are based, she can not do good 
work and may do positive harm. The best way to get this 
knowledge is directly from the men who are actively en- 
gaged, in the various activities of life. The best way to 
fifid out what kinds of problems the farmer meets and 
how he solves them is to go to the leading farmer of the 
community, and the same applies to the banker, the busi- 
ness man, the carpenter, the plasterer, the paper-hanger. 
ete. 
Prostems Must Be Variep 
Pupils solve problems in school in order to be able t 
solve other and similar problems that they may meet in 
life. The ability to successfully meet any kind of a simple 
arithmetical situation can not be developed by meeting a 
few types of situations but only by meeting many hic 
kinds. A boy who enters a large automobile factory an 
does one thing day after day learns to do that one thing 
remarkably well, but after several years of such experienc 
he is no nearer being a skilled automobile mechanic tha 
he was in the beginning. On the other hand a boy wh 
enters a garage that does. a large general repair edo 
meets a new problem every day, and, while he will neve 
|    
-P-A-G-E-261
  
NATURE AND SOURCES OF PROBLEMS 255 
attain the mechanical precision of the first boy at any one 
thing, he will eventually become a skilled automobile me- 
chanie and be able to successfully cope with almost any 
repair job that he may encounter. So, in arithmetic, the 
pupil who meets only a few types of problems may develop 
a mechanical skill in solving those types but it is the pupil 
who meets many and varied types, thinking each through 
as it occurs, that develops real power to apply his arith- 
metic to all kinds of situations. 
Most of our pupils will probably have to solve problems 
in simple interest some time in their lives, but most of 
them will never have to solve problems in lumber measure, 
plastering and paper hanging. It is necessary that the 
pupils solve problems in interest, but it is not at all neces- 
sary that they solve problems in lumber measure, plaster- 
ing and paper hanging. It is necessary, however, that 
they be given opportunities to use their knowledge of 
mensuration in as great a variety of situations as possible, 
and lumber measure, plastering and paper hanging are at 
least real, typical applications of mensuration, possessing 
the further advantage that they can easily be made con- 
erete to the pupils; and, as such, they should be used, 
unless a sufficient number of more important applications 
ean be found. Thus, in order to have a sufficient variety 
of real applications that can be made concrete to the pupils 
it may sometimes be necessary to use situations a knowl- 
edge of which is not absolutely essential to success in life. 
The teacher is never justified, however, in using situations 
that are not real life situations or that can not be made 
concrete. reat

The Steps. In order that the teacher may be able t 
properly guide and assist her pupils it is necessary that 
she clearly understand the thought steps involved in came 
ing a problem in arithmetic. The complete solution of an 
problem involves four steps: | 
‘1. Getting a clear understanding of the conditions of the 
problem. The first step in meeting any problematic sit: 
ation is to get a clear understanding of the elements o: 
that situation. In the case of arithmetical problems th 
pupils must have two things clearly in mind: (1) Th 
Problem; what they want to find, and (2) The Data; the 
various items of information given in the problem; or that 
are known or can be found out about the given situation. 
2. Planning the solution. Having the conditions of the 
problem clearly in mind, the next step is to plan the 
method of solution, 7.¢., the steps that must be taken to 
get the desired information from the known. 
8. Executing the Plan, and 
4. Checking the result obtained. The solution of an 
. arithmetical problem is not complete until the pupils have 
| determined whether or not their answers are correct. 
<o| \. The teacher’s duty with respect to these steps is two- 
| fold. In the first place she must see that the pupils form   oS 
‘\ must make these thought steps habitual. In the second 
place she must systematically develop in the pupils the 
ability to perform these steps for themselves. 
256 
  il  
-P-A-G-E-263
SOLVING PROBLEMS 257 
Maxine THE THOUGHT Sreps HABITUAL 
If left to their own devices the ‘pupils’ tendency is to 
start doing something before they really know what the 
problem is or have any definite plan for its solution) They 
jump blindly into the middle, trusting to luck that they 
will come out safely at the other end. They often use a 
“eut and try” or “trial and error” method) first trying 
one thing and then another until they get the proper re- 
sult. This is particularly true if answers are given in the 
book. The author recently watched a sixth grade pupil 
prepare her arithmetic lesson. She first read the problem 
hastily, then turned to the back of the book and looked 
at the answer and by comparing the answer with the 
numbers given in the problem decided what to do with 
these numbers in order to get the desired answer. She 
was quite skilful at this and usually “got the answer” 
after one,,or at the most two or three trials. This girl 
had not formed proper habits of thought in problem solving 
but instead had established habits that were extremely 
harmful and that made success in problem work impossible. 
From the primary grades up, the teacher should make it 
just as much her business to establish proper habits in 
problem solving as in addition, subtraction or any of the 
fundamentals. In trying to establish habits of proper 
thinking in solving problems the teacher must remember 
that the two most important factors in forming any habit 
are (1) Repetition of the desired method of procedure, 
and (2) Permitting no exceptions to the desired procedure 
to occur until the habit is well established. 
Repetition. Until the proper habits of thought are well 
established all problem solving should be done in class 
under the direct supervision of the teacher and should 
follow these steps.. Suppose the following problem is one 
of several beine solved in class. “If oranges cost 5¢ 
— 
1g Cd 
y 3  
-P-A-G-E-264
258 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
apiece, how much will you have to pay for 3?” The 
solution should always start with definite statements 
of The Problem and The Data. In stating the data 
each item of information known should be stated sepa 
rately and the statements should be first in words pagal 
than in numbers. After reading the problem the firs’ 
question should be “What are we to find?” When this is 
stated it should be written on the blackboard, as: 
o Problem—To find how much we must pay for th 
oranges. 
The next question raised should be “What does the 
problem tell you?” At first the pupils will probably 
answer in numbers, as 5¢ and 38. They must be made to 
see, however, that in thinking through the problem and 
planning the method of solution, the actual numbers are 
not important, the essential thing is what these numbers 
represent, so the important thing to know is that the prob- 
lem tells us two things, (1) the cost of one orange, and 
(2) the number of oranges bought. In order to eee 
these two items of information different pupils may be 
asked to each state one thing that the problem tells, and 
as each is stated it should be written on the board belo 
the statement of the problem, first in words and then L 
numbers, as: | 
Data—Cost of 1 orange =5¢. 
Number of oranges bought=3. 
Then, and not until then, the question of the method to 
be used in solving the problem should be raised. In this 
problem all the pupils need to decide is whether to add, 
subtract, multiply or divide. In more difficult problen 
later on, they should plan out the whole solution hed 
carrying out any of the calculations. 
Having decided that they must multiply in the above 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  
  SOLVING PROBLEMS 259 
problem the pupils would get the answer mentally. In 
more ‘difficult problems, having determined upon the 
method of solution, the pupils would next carry out the 
calculations and finally consider how they could Se 
whether the answer obtained is correct. 
Permit No Exceptions. Until the proper habits are 
established all of the problem work should be done in 
class and should follow these steps. Later, in solving 
simple problems the pupils will grasp the essentials of 
the problem and plan the solution at sight and almost 
unconsciously, and after the proper habits of thinking 
are firmly established they should be encouraged to do 
this whenever possible, but until that time the teacher 
should permit no exceptions and should insist that the 
pupils follow these steps consciously and in the proper 
order whenever they solve a problem. Even after the 
proper habits have apparently been established and the 
pupils start working independently, exercises similar to 
the above, in which the pupils solve problems in class, must 
be held frequently in order that the teacher may make 
sure that the correct method of procedure is being used 
and can detect and break any bad habits before they 
become fixed. 
Besides making the proper method of procedure habit- 
ual, the teacher has to develop the ability to perform these 
steps successfully. If the teacher goes about this sys- 
tematically and intelligently from the third grade on, the 
majority of the pupils by the time they reach the eighth 
grade will have formed proper habits and have developed 
the ability to solve any simple arithmetical problem. 
, DEvELOPING THE ABILITY TO GrasP THE ESSENTIAL 
ConDITIONS OF THE PROBLEM 
Language Difficulties. If the problem is met in words ~ 
the pupils may have difficulty in determining what the
-P-A-G-E-266
  260 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Problem is and what Data is given simply because they 
do not understand the language of the statement. The 
statement may be involved or ambiguous, or may involve 
words that are not in the pupils’ vocabulary. In making 
problems herself the teacher should be very careful that 
the statement is concise and direct, can be interpreted in 
only one way, and is in the pupils’ own vocabulary. In 
the case of text book problems, the teacher must clear up 
all difficulties arising from the language of the problem 
before the pupils are asked to solve it. | 
Problems Must be Concrete. Again the pupils may be 
unable to pick out the essentials of the problem if the 
situation on which it is based is not clearly understood 
As already stated the pupils should never try to solve a 
problem that is not concrete to them and it is the business 
of the teacher to see that the problems are concrete or are 
made so in some way. 
Practice. Granting that no language difficulties exist 
and that the pupils understand the life situation on which 
the problem is based, they may still have trouble in taking 
the connected, detailed statement of the problem and 
abstracting from it its essential elements. There are sev- 
eral things the teacher can do to help develop this ability. 
The most important of these is plenty of practice. O 
course the pupils get practice on this step every time the: 
solve a problem, but this alone is not enough. As long a: 
the pupils are having trouble with this step, frequent drill 
should be given on this step alone. One of the best meth- 
ods of doing this is to take a list of problems, have a pupil 
read the first one, then call on another pupil to state The 
Problem, and on other pupils to state the various items of . 
Data. When the Problem and the Data have been -   pletely stated in this way for the first problem, go on t 
the others and handle them in the same way. Concentrat- 
ing on the first step only without planning the solutio
-P-A-G-E-267
  SOLVING PROBLEMS 261 
or solving the problem has several advantages. In the 
first place it saves time and provides more practice on this 
step in a given time. In the second place it concentrates 
the pupils’ interest and attention on this one step. If 
permitted to go ahead and solve the problem the pupils’ 
chief interest will be centered on “getting the answer” and 
they will neglect the important preliminary steps. 
Stating Problems to Fit Given Conditions. In solving 
problems the pupils must be able to read a problem that 
is stated in detailed, connected language and pick out the 
essential elements, namely, the Problem and the Data. It 
will help them to do this if they are practiced on the reverse 
process, if they are given the Problem and Data, and 
required to build up around these the detailed statement. | 
For example, the pupils might be asked to state a problem 
based on the following: 
Problem—To find the Net Price. 
Data— Marked Price = 
% of Discount= 
The first problems the pupils state will probably not be 
real problems at*all but only a statement of the given 
data in connected form such as, “The Marked Price of a 
certain article is $25 with a discount of 10%. Find the 
Net Price.” With a little practice and direction, however, 
they will soon be able to state real, live, interesting prob- 
lems, as “A. B. Smith and Co. is holding a clearance sale 
and is giving a 20% discount on all boys’ suits. What 
would I have to pay for a suit if it is marked $12?” 
Sometimes actual figures may be given in stating the 
Problem and Data to the pupils but usually the pupils 
should supply the figures for themselves as this serves 
to make them realize that the important thing is not the 
figures themselves but what they stand for. The pupils 
should criticize each others’ problems, considering
-P-A-G-E-268
262 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
whether they are well stated, whether they are real life 
problems, and whether the data given is in accordance 
with actual life conditions. Plenty of practice of this 
kind in making problems to fit given sets of conditions 
will not only help the pupils greatly in determining the 
essential conditions in a given problem but will also help 
to develop an insight into actual life conditions. 
DEVELOPING THE ABILITY TO PLAN THE SOLUTION 
Practice. Although pupils sometimes have difficulty 
with the first step it is the second, or the planning of the 
solution that is the most difficult and gives the greatest 
trouble. Plenty of practice must be given on this step. 
Much of this practice will be obtained in connection with 
the regular work in solving problems, but this needs to 
be supplemented by extra drill on this step, which is not 
only the most difficult but also the crucial step in solving 
any problem. Again, a good way to do this is for the 
teacher to take a list of problems and have the problem 
read, call on different pupils to state the Problem and 
the various items of the Data and then have the pupils 
plan the solution, without carrying out the solution after 
it is planned. A class exercise of this kind concentrates 
the pupils’ attention on this important step and does not 
permit it to be distracted by “getting the answer.” Oral 
exercises in planning the method of solution should be 
given almost daily. The problems used should involve 
the different processes and usually the numbers involved 
should be simple so that the pupils’ minds may be left 
free for the thought work. The statement of the method 
of solution should be in terms of words rather than in 
terms of figures and the pupils must be led to form the 
habit of clear, concise, and definite expression. This work 
should be started as early as the third grade with simple 
one-step problems and continued systematically and regu-*
-P-A-G-E-269
  
SOLVING PROBLEMS 263 
larly through the elementary schools with problems of 
gradually increasing difficulty. 
Careful Gradation of Difficulty. In developing the abil- 
ity to plan the solution careful gradation of the problems 
is of the greatest importance. In the second and third 
grades the pupils must develop the ability to solve one-step 
problems. This means that in such a problem they must 
be able to determine whether to add, subtract, multiply 
or divide. In the fourth grade they must develop the 
ability to plan the solution of two-step and in the upper 
grades of still more complicated and difficult’ problems. 
If the degree of difficulty of the problems is carefully 
graded and gradually increased, and if the pupils develop 
the ability to plan problems of a given degree of difficulty 
before trying more difficult ones the complex problems 
of the eighth grade should be no more difficult for the 
eighth grade pupils than the two-step problems of the 
fourth grade for the fourth grade pupils, and these in 
turn should be no more difficult than the one-step prob- 
lems of the second and third grades are to the pupils of 
those grades. If the increase in the degree of difficulty 
comes by big steps instead of gradually, or if the increase 
comes too rapidly the pupils become discouraged and are 
driven to mechanical methods of solution. 
Teach Arithmetic as a Tool. Pupils will always have 
trouble in planning the solution of problems unless arith- 
metic is from the very beginning taught as a tool and the 
arithmetical fact or process connected in the pupils’ minds 
with the kind of concrete situation in which it is used. 
Teachers realize that it is their duty to teach their pupils 
to add, subtract, multiply and divide, but many teachers 
do not seem to realize that it is just as much their duty 
to see to it that the pupils become familiar with the various 
types of concrete situations that may arise involving these 
processes so that they will recognize these situations.   
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  
264 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
If the connection is to be formed in the pupils’ minds 
between the facts and processes on the one hand and the 
conerete situations calling for the facts and processes on 
the other the two must be presented together and always 
kept together. This means that as soon as a new fact, 
series of facts, or process is presented, concrete problems 
must be given involving the facts or process and that from 
that time on the abstract drill on the facts or process and 
the applied problems must be kept side by side, usually 
in the same recitation. If possible, the need for the new 
information should come first, but where this is not pos- 
sible at least the use of the information should follow its 
acquisition immediately. In the work on the measurement 
of a circle the pupils might encounter the problem of 
determining the circumference of a circular plot of ground. 
They might find it rather difficult to measure the cireum- 
ference directly, but comparatively easy to measure the 
diameter. This might lead to the question, “Is there any 
relation between the circumference and diameter of a 
circle so that we can find the cireumference by measuring 
the diameter?” Then by measuring the circumferences and 
diameters of various circular objects the pupils could dis- 
cover the relation C=7d and apply it to the original prob- 
lem and to other similar problems and to problems where 
the diameter is found by measuring the circumference. 
If the discovery of the new relationship does not arise 
from the needs of a concrete problem, as soon as the new 
fact is discovered its uses should be immediately consid- 
ered. As soon as the pupils discover that C—7d, they 
should consider how this fact can be used, namely, that 
it will enable them to find the circumference when the 
diameter is known or can be found; and to find the diam- 
eter when the circumference is known or can be found. 
The pupils should then at once use this fact in problems 
of these types. A new fact or process should never be
-P-A-G-E-271
    
SOLVING PROBLEMS 265 
taught merely as a fact or process but always as a tool 
to be used in solving certain types of concrete situations. 
It has already been stated that less abstract drill is neces- 
sary where more time is given to applied problems and 
where the abstract and applied phases are kept as closely 
connected as possible. Not only is this true but this close 
correlation of the abstract and applied is absolutely neces- 
sary if the pupils are ever to attain any facility in apply- 
ing the tools of arithmetic to concrete situations. The old 
type of organization under which the pupils spent the first 
three years in acquiring the tools of arithmetic, the abstract 
facts and processes, and in the fourth year started to apply 
these to concrete situations, is foredoomed to failure. The 
only way that the pupils will ever learn to apply their 
arithmetic is to apply it from the very beginning. 
The teacher must make certain that the pupils meet all 
of the different types of problems that are solved by use 
of the given facts or process. Thus, there are three types 
of problems in subtraction with which the pupils must 
become familiar as illustrated by the following problems: 
(a) If Mary has to walk 5 blocks to school and Johnny 
has to walk 8, how many more blocks does Johnny walk 
than Mary? 
(b) If you had 10¢ this morning and spent 4¢ for candy, 
how many cents would you have left? 
(c) If you have 3¢ and you want to buy a ball that 
costs 5¢, how many more cents must you save? 
These might be called the Comparison or Difference, 
the Take Away or Remainder, and the Additive Types, 
respectively. The pupils will not meet problems of all 
of these types at once, but by the time they complete the 
third grade they should have had sufficient experience with 
all three types to recognize them as subtraction problems. 
There are two types of problems in division which the 
pupils must learn to recognize.  
-P-A-G-E-272
  266 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
(a) Measuring Type: If Mary has 8¢ to spend for 
candy, how many all-day suckers can she buy if they cost 
2¢ apiece? 
(b) Partitive Type: If you have 9 apples and share 
them equally with Helen and Mary, how many apples will 
each of you have? 
Problems Without Numbers. At first the pupils get an 
idea of the uses of the facts and processes unconsciously 
by using them frequently in concrete situations. Thus, 
having learned some subtraction facts the pupils at once 
start to use them in concrete problems, and by so doing 
gradually come to recognize subtraction situations as such 
and to distinguish them from addition, multiplication and 
division situations. Later, the pupils should be helped to 
generalize their ideas of addition, subtraction, multiplica- 
tion and division situations. One of the best ways of doing 
this is by means of generalized problems or problems with- 
out numbers. The pupils first meet individual problems 
such as (a) If you go to the store and pay 5¢ for a tablet 
and 3¢ for a pencil, how much must you give the clerk? 
and (b) If oranges cost 5¢ apiece, how much must you 
pay for 4? Later, they should meet these same types of 
problems in a generalized form, as: 
(a) If you buy two articles and know the cost of each, 
how do you find the cost of both? and 
(b) If you know the cost of one article and want to find 
the cost of several of the same kind, what do you do? 
All of the important types of problems in arithmetic, 
after having first been frequently met as individual prob- 
lems, should be generalized in this way. This is one of 
the best ways that has ever been discovered to bridge the 
gap between the ability to solve certain problems of a given 
type and the ability to solve all problems of that type. 
Used occasionally, such problems will do little good, but 
used systematically from the third grade up, they will do
-P-A-G-E-273
  
SOLVING PROBLEMS 267 
much to overcome the pupils’ difficulty in determining 
“what to do” in a given problem. 
The pupils find the work with these problems intensely 
interesting. A third grade teacher once described to the 
author her experience in using such problems. The first 
day the pupils found them rather difficult and, finally, 
one boy after struggling with one for several minutes gave 
it up in disgust saying, “Aw, I could do it if it had some 
numbers in it.” A few weeks later, however, the same 
class thought these problems great fun, so much so that 
one girl broke out at the end of the recitation with, “Oh, 
Miss A; , let’s have these every day, they are just 
like conundrums.” 
To make clear the exact nature of these generalized 
problems or problems without numbers, a miscellaneous 
list follows: 
1. If you know how many eggs you found this morning 
and how many this evening, how would you find out how 
many you found altogether? 
2. If you know how much money you handed the clerk 
and how much you spent, what would you do to find how 
much change you should get? 
3. If you know the amount of goods needed to make 
one doll’s dress, how could you find the amount needed to 
make three? 
4. If you know the cost of one dozen, how would you find 
the cost of six oranges? 
5. If you know the weight of each member of your class, 
how do you find the average weight? 
6. What measurements must you take and what must 
you do to find the area of a rectangle? 
7. What measurements must you take and what must 
you do to find the number of square feet of plastering 
needed to cover the walls and ceiling of this room? 
8. If you know the circumference of a wheel, how do.   
 
-P-A-G-E-274
    268 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
you find how many times the wheel will turn in going a 
mile? ; 
9. If you know the amount paid for a certain property 
and the rate of commission, how do you find the commis- 
sion? 
10. If you know the time that a sum of money is on 
interest, the rate, and the sum of money, how do you find 
the interest? ‘ 
11. If you know what a dealer paid for some goods, and 
his selling price, how do you find the per cent. of profit 
or loss? 
12. If you know the present population of your town 
and the population ten years ago, how would you find the 
per cent. of increase or decrease? 
13. What would you have to know and what would you 
do to find the per cent. of attendance in your room for the 
last month? 
14. If a merchant knows the list price of a certain article 
and the per cent of discount, how does he find the net price 
or what he must pay for the article? 
15. What measurements would you take and what would 
you do to find the number of gallons of water a cistern will 
hold? 
Have Pupils Make Problems to be Solved in a Given 
Way. Another effective method of developing the ability 
to plan the solution of problems is to have the pupils make 
up problems to be solved in a certain way. Thus, in the 
second and third grades the pupils should be asked to 
make up problems to be solved by addition, or by subtrac- 
tion, or multiplication, or division. Making up problems 
to be solved by addition forces the pupils to keep their eyes 
open and to notice carefully in what kind of problems 
addition is used and will help them to recognize addition 
problems when they meet them. In the fourth grade the 
pupils should make up problems to be worked by two
-P-A-G-E-275
SOLVING PROBLEMS : 269 
processes, say addition and then subtraction. In the same 
way, pupils can make problems to be worked by finding a 
fractional part of a number, by finding what per cent. one 
number is of another, ete. 
Clear Grasp of Relations Involved. Planning the 
method of solution involves bridging the gap from the 
known to the unknown. The pupils must first have clearly 
in mind what they want to find out (the unknown) and 
the data they have at their disposal (the known). They 
must then plan how to use the known in order to get the 
unknown. To do this they must have a clear grasp of 
the relationships between the various quantities in the 
problem—between the unknown and the known. Anything 
the teacher can do, or make the pupils form the habit 
of doing, that will make these relations clear will help the 
pupils in planning the solution. In the first place if the 
pupils are to grasp the relations the ‘problem must be 
conerete to them. The teacher should encourage the pupils 
to dramatize the situation, to imagine themselves in the 
place and circumstances of the person who must solve 
the problem and try to visualize and image the whole 
situation in all its relations. Most pupils in thinking 
through problems think in abstract terms and phrases. 
It is the duty of the teacher to go beyond the words in 
which the pupils clothe their thoughts and to discover if 
there are any ideas and images behind these words. If 
the pupils ‘are to develop the ability to solve problems they 
must form the hahit of thinking in terms of the actual, 
concrete situations on which the problems are based. 
Diagrams and Graphs. Often a diagram or graph will 
help make clear the conditions of the problem and the rela- 
tions involved. Thus, in problems in figuring profits and 
determining selling prices where everything is figured as 
a per cent. of the selling price, the solution of all of the 
problems depends upon a clear grasp of the relations
-P-A-G-E-276
270 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
between the Selling Price, Cost Price, Expenses, Net Profit 
and Gross Profit. These relations can be made clear by 
means of a diagram such as the one below, where the whole 
circle represents the selling price of an article. 
In working the following prob- 
lem if the pupils draw the dia- 
Gross gram and place directly on it the 
‘ Profits given data it helps them to see 
Weed the relation between the known 
and the unknown. 
Problem—If a retail carpet 
dealer pays $40 for a rug, and 
his expenses are 20% of his sales, what must he sell the 
rug for in order to make a net profit of 15% of the selling 
price? 
From the diagram the pupils see that 
the expenses and net profit amount to 
35% of the selling price, so that 65% of 
the selling price must pay for the article 
or equal the cost price of $40. 
Substitute Easy Numbers for Those 
Given in Problem. Another method of 
bringing out clearly the relations involved in a problem is 
to think the problem through, substituting easy numbers 
for the more complicated ones given. This enables the 
pupils to think in specific figures instead of general terms 
and at the same time by using easy numbers avoids dis- 
’ tracting their minds with difficult and long calculations. ~ 
  MerHops OF CHECKING THE SOLUTION or PROBLEMS 
1. Check by solving another problem made from the 
original problem by interchanging the quantity found and 
one item of the given data. Suppose the original prob- 
lem is, “A publisher wishes to receive a net price of $1.20
-P-A-G-E-277
  
SOLVING PROBLEMS 271 
for a book. At what must he list it if he allows a 20% 
discount from the list price?” 
Problem—To find the List Price. 
Data— Net Price=$1.20. 
Discount—20% List Price. 
Solution—80% List Price—$1.20, 
30 5 
List Price—$7.20 X oo 
This result could be checked by taking the list price 
found and deducting the 20% discount to see if it gives the 
proper net price of $1.20. 
Check— $1.50

“A man bought a house and lot for $9500. The insur- 
ance, taxes, repairs and other expenses average $246 a year. 
At what price per month must he rent it to make a profit 
at 6% each year on his original investment?” 
Problem—To find the monthy rent: 
Data— Amount of investment—$9500. 
Desired return—6% of investment. 
Expenses=$246. 
Solution— $9500 
.06 
$570.00 yearly return 
$246.00 expenses 
12)$816.00 yearly rent 
$68.00 monthly rent 
This result could be checked by taking the monthly rent 
found (68.00) and figuring the rate or return it will 
' give to see if it really will give the desired return of 6%.

2. Check by solving the problem by another method. 
Often a problem may be solved by several different meth- 
ods. Where this is the case an effective method of checking 
is to solve it in two different ways and compare the results. 
The following problem illustrates this method of checking. 
A rectangular grass plot 10 ft. by 30 ft. is to be sur- 
rounded by a cement walk 6 ft. wide. Find the number 
of square feet of cement in the walk.

SOLVING PROBLEMS 273 
3. Check by going over the work a second time. Tf no 
better method of checking the result can be found the 
work should be reviewed carefully in order to detect errors. 
This is not a very satisfactory method of checking, as the 
mind in going over the same work in the same way tends 
to repeat itself, so any error made the first time is apt 
to be repeated. This method should be used only as a 
last resort when no more effective way of checking can 
be found. It should be remembered that errors in the 
solution of concrete problems may be of two kinds: (1) 
errors in planning the solution, or in thinking through the 
problem; and (2) errors in carrying out the solution, or 
in the mechanical calculations. These calculations should 
be checked as soon as performed, so in checking the final 
result the reasoning involved in planning the solution 
should be gone over carefully to make sure that no error 
has been made. 
Approximate Methods of Checking. Sometimes ap- 
proximate methods of checking are sufficiently accurate to 
detect large mistakes. The two most useful approximate 
methods are: (1) Before carrying out the complete solu- 
tion, form an approximate estimate of the answer by sub- 
stituting the nearest easy numbers for the numbers of the 
problem and use this estimate as a check on the solution 
when obtained; (2) Put the answer obtained back in its 
concrete setting to see if it is reasonable. 
Estimating Result. The first method may be illustrated 
by means of the following problem. “A contractor agreed 
to build a circular basin for a fountain at the rate of 65¢ 
for each square foot in the bottom of the basin. Find the 
cost of a basin 38 ft. in diameter.” The result can be 
approximated by calling the radius 20 ft., using 73, and 
calling sixty-five cents % of a dollar. Then: 20°—400. 
34001200. % of 1200800. This can be used as a 
rough check on the exact result (which is $737.18) when
-P-A-G-E-280
  24 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
oc 
obtafned, and is sufficiently accurate to detect any large 
error, particularly the common error of placing the decimal 
point in the wrong place and getting answers such as 
$73.72 or $7371.80 instead of $737.18. 
Place Result Back in Its Concrete Setting. The second 
method of checking approximately may be illustrated by 
the following problems. “The President of the United 
States receives a yearly salary of $75,000. Counting 300- 
working days in the year, find his daily salary.” This 
problem was recently given to several eighth grade classes 
and they obtained answers ranging all the way from $2.50 
through $25 and $2500 to $25,000. Many of these errors 
would have been detected if the pupils after getting the 
result had stopped to think what the result stood for, had 
put it back in its concrete setting to see if it was reason- 
able. If they had done this it would have been obvious 
that $2.50 was entirely too small for the President’s daily 
pay and that $25,000 was entirely too large, as his yearly 
salary is only $75,000. 
Another illustration of the same thing occurred recently 
in one of the author’s normal college classes. On a written 
test a problem in commercial discount was given in which 
the students had to figure the list price. One student 
obtained a result smaller than the net price and never 
noticed anything wrong. Nothing will serve to detect 
large errors more effectively than thé habit of considering 
the result in its conerete setting to see if it is reasonable, 
or entirely out of reason.

CHAPTER IV 
FORM OF WRITTEN SOLUTIONS—ANALYSIS 
Reduce Written Calculation to a Minimum. In life the v2 
important thing in solving problems is to get the correct 
result with a minimum of figuring. In school, too often, 
instead of developing this ability and habit we insist on 
long, complicated forms of solution. In most of the work 
with problems in the grades the pupils should be required 
to get their results with a minimum of figuring, doing as 
much of the work as possible mentally and putting down 
the written calculations in the most economical form. The 
calculations should be carried out with abstract numbers 
and only the final result “labeled” unless the pupils find 
it necessary to label other numbers to aid them in their 
thinking. The pupils should be encouraged to see which X 
can get the shortest solution and should be led to take \ 
as much interest and pride in this as in getting the correct 
result. ; 
As an illustration, take the following problem. “One 
year a field produced 56,800 pounds of wheat. The next 
year with better preparation of the soil and greater care 
in selecting seed, the same field produced 62,500 pounds. 93 
How much was the increase worth at 85¢ a bushel?” a

-P-A-G-E-282
  276 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Full Written Solutions. The preceding should not be 
taken to,mean that pupils should never be required to use 
a complete form of solution. On the other hand, a com- 
plete form of solution will often aid the pupils in solving 
difficult problems, so the pupils should be made familiar 
with good complete forms to use when necessary. and 
should have considerable practice in writing such complete 
solutions. But as stated before, most of the time the 
emphasis should be on getting the result with a minimum 
of written work rather than on the complete solution. 
There are three essentials to any good, complete solu- 
tion. (1) The form of the written solution must follow 
and emphasize the thought steps taken in solving the 
problem. (2) The solution must be intelligible. Anyone 
who sees the solution should be able to get from it, without 
any further source of information, the conditions of the 
problem and the method used in solving it as well as the 
result obtained. (3) The solution must be as brief as the 
other two requirements will permit. Any form that satis- 
fies these conditions is good, and any form that fails to 
satisfy all three of these conditions is bad. 
Tue Wrirren Sotution Must Foutow AND EMPHASIZE 
THE THOUGHT STEPS 
The thought steps in solving any problem as already 
stated are: (1) Getting a clear understanding of the 
Problem and the Data, (2) Planning the solution, (3) 
Executing the plan, and (4) Checking the result obtained. — 
The complete written solution should emphasize and follow 
these steps if it is to aid the pupils in solving difficult 
problems. It follows that the large subdivisions of the 
solution will be Problem, Data, Plan, Solution, and Check. 
These or similar headings should be used to-set off the 
different parts of the complete solution.
-P-A-G-E-283
ANALYSIS 277 
Problem and Data. In stating the Problem and Data, 
the statements used should be as brief and as simple and 
direct as possible. The various items of the Data should 
be stated separately, and in order to aid the pupils in 
their thinking they should be stated first in words. In 
the problem used above as an illustration the solution 
would start with some such statements as: 
Problem—To find the value of the increase. 
Data— No. lbs. wheat produced first year—56,800. 
No. lbs. wheat produced second year=62,500. 
Value per bushel—85¢. 
Some teachers prefer to write the Data first and the 
Problem second. There are arguments in favor of each 
order. In life when we meet an actual situation the prob- 
lem usually arises first and the data necessary to solve it 
is then obtained. Thus, if for some reason we need to 
know the number of acres in a field, the need for this 
knowledge, the Problem, first arises, and in order to solve 
this problem we then obtain the Data by measuring the 
length and width of the field. Another argument for plac- 
ing the Problem first is that this conforms to the method 
of procedure in other subjects where the problem method 
of teaching is used. About the only arguments for the 
other order are that it is the traditional order and it is 
the order usually used in higher mathematics. 
The Plan. Some teachers have the pupils include this 
step in the written solution. Thus, in the problem above 
the plan might be written as follows: 
Plan—1. Find number of lbs. of increase by subtracting. 
2. Change the increase from Ibs. to bushels by 
dividing by 60, the number of pounds in a 
bushel. 
8. Find the value of the increase by multiplying 
by $0.85, the value of one bushel.
-P-A-G-E-284
  278 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
Sometimes it is possible to indicate the processes to be 
performed in a single statement before performing any of 
the calculations. This may be done in the above problem. 
Plan— 
Value of srireeue eco ee ena OOD, 60 x .85. 
In building up and explaining this statement the pupils 
should be able to state in words what the result of each 
step will be. The first step, 62,500—56,800, will give the 
number of pounds increase, this result divided by 60 will 
give the number of bushels increase, and this result multi- 
pled by .85 will give the value of the increase in dollars 
and cents. 
Many teachers object to writing out the plan of the 
solution on the grounds that it takes too much time. It 
is not necessary to make this step a written one, providing 
the teacher makes sure that the pupils formulate a definite 
plan before attempting the solution. The formulation of 
the plan may be oral instead of written if the teacher pre- 
fers. It must be remembered, however, that full written 
solutions ought not to be demanded all of the time but 
only when needed to help the pupils in their solution. The 
time taken to write out the plan, then, is not a serious 
objection, and many teachers find a written plan one of 
the most effective methods of making certain that the 
pupils have a definite plan in mind before they start add- 
ing, subtracting, ete. 
The Solution. To be intelligible, the solution must indi- 
cate, in order, all of the steps taken in solving the problem. 
For the sake of brevity, however, it is usually better simply 
to indicate the calculations and the results, performing 
the actual calculation on scratch paper. This is partic- 
ularly true in the case of long multiplications and divisions. 
In indicating the solution two forms are in common use,
-P-A-G-E-285
    ANALYSIS 279 
the horizontal and the vertical. Sometimes one of these 
is the shorter and sometimes the other. In many cases the 
two forms can be combined to advantage. The solution 
of the problem used above is given below first in the hori- 
zontal and then in the vertical form. 
Solution—No. lbs. increase=62,500—56,800—5700. 
5700 60 = 95. 
Value of increase=95 X$.85=$80.75. 
Solution— 62500 
56800 
60) 5700 
95 
_85 475

$80.75 value of the increase. 
In the horizontal solution the result of each step is 
labeled and the label is put first instead of last. This, 
again, forces the pupils to plan ahead, to think first instead 
of last. Thus, in the first step the pupils must think “I 
must first: find the number of pounds increase by sub- 
tracting” and then subtract. If the label is written last 
it encourages them in their natural tendency to do some- 
thing first and then try to find out what the result obtained 
means. 
Check. Every problem solved should be checked in 
some way. The check may be either written or oral. If 
the second of the two approximate methods of checking 
suggested, or the method of reviewing the reasoning is used, 
the check must be oral. If either of the other methods 
is used, the check would be written and should be made 
part of the complete written solution. The easiest way 
to check the result obtained in the above problem would No. bushels increase=  
-P-A-G-E-286
  280 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
be to estimate the result, using approximate figures. The 
increase is roughly 6000 lbs. or 100 bushels, which at 85¢ 
a bushel would be worth $85.00. This result, it should be 
remembered, is evidently slightly too large, as the increase 
is somewhat less than 6000 pounds. This rough estimate 
of the result should be made when the solution was planned 
and before it was carried out, and used as a rough check 
on the result finally obtained, namely, $80.75. 
A satisfactory complete solution of the above problem, 
gathering together the various parts already worked out, 
would be as follows: 
Problem—To find the value of the increase. 
Data— No. lbs. wheat produced first year=56,800.

Tue ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 
Definition and Purpose. An analysis of a problem in 
arithmetic is an orderly, concise statement of the thought 
steps that lead to the discovery of the solution. Every time 
the pupils solve a problem they must analyze it. Usually 
they do this thinking to themselves, and the teacher sees 
only the result of the thinking—the solution of the prob- 
lem. Sometimes, however, the pupils must be required 
to state the thought steps by which they discovered their
-P-A-G-E-287
  ANALYSIS : 281 
solutions. Such statements given by the pupils give the 
teacher valuable information, as they expose the pupils’ 
thinking and enable the teacher to locate and overcome 
difficulties and to make certain that the pupils are forming 
habits of thought that will aid them in solving more diffi- 
cult problems. 
In the case of problems solved outside of class the teacher 
obtains this information by means of the complete written 
solution discussed above. Often, however, the pupils 
should do their thinking in class and aloud. This is par- 
ticularly important when problems of a new type or of 
increased difficulty are first met. These should be analyzed 
orally in class by the pupils before they try to solve them. 
This makes it possible for the teacher to locate and over- 
come difficulties and helps to establish proper habits of 
thought. Preliminary class analysis is necessary at this 
time but must be dropped as soon as possible; if continued 
too long it will cripple the pupils. Eventually they must 
be able to analyze and solve the problems without assist- 
ance, but the best way to bring this about is to anticipate 
difficulties and form proper habits, in the beginning. 
If the pupils have solved a list of assigned problems 
_ suecessfully there is nothing gained by having them explain 
or analyze their solutions. If, however, a pupil has tried 
to solve a problem by himself and has failed the teacher 
should not be satisfied with merely ‘knowing that he has 
failed, but should try to find out the eause of his failure. 
The best way to locate the difficulty is to have the pupil try 
to think through the problem out loud. Often in this way 
the teacher can locate and help the pupil overcome the 
trouble. If the pupil can not overcome his own difficulty 
with the aid of the other pupils and the teacher, then the 
next best thing is to have another pupil explain or analyze 
the problem for his benefit. 
The traditional problem recitation, in which the pupils
-P-A-G-E-288
  282 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
write the solutions of the problems assigned on the black- 
board and then analyze or explain them, is a very effective 
way of killing time—it serves no other purpose. Such 
a recitation always reminds the author of a science teacher 
in a high school who was once forced to take a class in 
English for a few weeks. The recitation period was forty 
minutes long but seemed forty years to this teacher, as he 
could think of nothing to do to occupy the time. The class 
was reading Ivanhoe, and finally having exhausted all his 
resources, in sheer desperation he sent the class to the 
board and kept them there the whole forty minutes copying 
Ivanhoe word for word from their books on to the board. 
There is nothing gained by having a pupil analyze or 
explain a problem that he has successfully solved unless 
he does it for the benefit of some other pupil. If a list of 
problems has been assigned for home work, a few minutes 
at the beginning of the hour should usually be sufficient 
for the teacher to check up on the work and to clear up 
difficulties. The rest of the hour should then be spent on 
working more problems in class rather than on explaining 
problems already worked. 
Character of the Analysis. Since the purpose of the 
analysis is to expose the pupils’ thinking, it follows that it 
should be in the pupils’ own words and should not be for- 
malized. A pupil may recite very glibly a formal analysis 
such as the following: “If one pencil costs 4¢, three pen- 
cils will cost three times as much as one pencil, or 3 times 
4¢ which is 12¢,” but the chances are that the thinking 
back of the analysis is no more his own than is the phrase- 
ology in which it is expressed. Pupils should be permitted 
to explain or analyze a problem in their own way and in 
their own words. It should be remembered, however, that 
the analysis is simply a statement of the thinking necessary 
in solving the problem and should therefore make clear 
the steps involved. It should start with a statement of the
-P-A-G-E-289
  ANALYSIS aay 
Problem, and the Data, and this should be followed by” 
statement of the various steps in the solution and the 
results of each step. 
Although the analysis of problems is very important, it 
ean easily be overdone. An explanation or analysis as 
such is worthless; it is only worth while when it is used 
to assist the pupils in solving problems. It should always 
be used with a definite purpose in mind. The only way 
that pupils will ever develop the ability to solve problems 
is by solving problems. Much of the time often spent in 
explaining and talking about the solution of problems had 
much better be spent in solving more problems. dy

    CHAPTER V 
MEASURING THE ABILITY TO USE ARITH- 
METIC 
Tests for measuring the pupils’ mastery of the funda- 
mentals of arithmetic have been discussed in a previous 
chapter. These by themselves give only a partial measure 
of arithmetical ability. As has been seen, the ability to 
use the fundanientals in life situations is just as important 
as a mastery of the fundamentals themselves. The tests 
already considered, therefore, need to be supplemented by 
others to measure the ability to apply arithmetic to con- 
crete situations. 
Several tests have been devised for this purpose. They 
are not as satisfactory as the tests already described, but 
properly used they give the teacher much valuable infor- 
mation. The chief defect of all the following tests is the 
fact that they measure ability to solve a certain type of 
more or less artificial text book problem, rather than the 
ability to apply arithmetic to actual life situations. No 
one has as yet attempted to devise tests to measure the 
latter ability. 
One of the first tests devised to measure the ability to 
solve problems was the Stone Reasoning Test,* which is 
given below.

day papers at 2 cents each. How many did he buy? 
3. If James had 4 times as much money as George, he 
would have $16. How much money has George? : 
4. How many pencils can you buy for 50 cents at the 
rate of 2 for 5 cents? 
5. The uniforms for a baseball nine cost $2.50 each. 
The shoes cost $2 a pair. What was the total cost of uni- 
forms and shoes for the nine? 
6. In the schools of a certain city there are 2,200 pupils; 
¥% are in the primary grades, 4 in the grammar grades, % 
in the High School and the rest in the night school. How 
many pupils are there in the night school? 
7. If 3% tons of coal cost $21, what will 5% tons cost? 
8. A newsdealer bought some magazines for $1. He sold 
them for $1.20, gaining 5 cents on each magazine. How 
many magazines were there? 
9. A girl spent % of her money for car fare, and three 
times as much for clothes. Half of what she had left was 
80 cents. How much money did she have at first? 
10. Two girls receive $2.10 for making button-holes. One 
makes 42, the other 28. How shall they divide the money? 
11. Mr. Brown paid % of the cost of a building; Mr. 
Johnson paid % the cost. Mr. Johnson received $500 more 
annual rent than Mr. Brown. How much did each receive? 
12. A freight train left Albany for New York at 6 
o’clock. An express left on the same track at 8 o’clock. 
It went at the rate of 40 miles an hour. At what time of 
day will it overtake the freight train if the freight train 
stops after it has gone 56 miles? 
The twelve examples included in the test are not of 
equal difficulty. Their relative difficulty was determined
-P-A-G-E-292
  286 TEACHING ARITHMETIC 
by giving them in chance order to one hundred sixth grade 
pupils. The comparative difficulty or value so deter- 
mined is:

Method of Giving and of Scoring. The pupils are given 
fifteen minutes in which to solve as many problems as pos- 
sible. This time was chosen because it was found to be 
“the time in which a majority of the pupils worked through 
the first six or seven problems and in which practically no 
pupil completed the test.” In scoring, the problems are 
marked right or wrong, according as the reasoning is right 
or wrong, regardless of whether the answer is correct or 
not. If the problem contains more than one reasoning step 
eredit is given for each step reasoned correctly. Thus, if 
there are three reasoning steps and only one is reasoned 
correctly, % credit is given. If a problem is unfinished, 
credit is given for the reasoning steps correctly performed. 
' The individual scores are found by adding the values of 
the problems reasoned correctly. Thus, if a pupil has the 
first four correct, the fifth two-thirds correct, and in the 
sixth has correctly performed two of the five reasoning 
steps, his individual score would be 1+1+1+1+%+ 
(% of 14)—5.23. Class scores are obtained by adding the 
individual scores and changing to the basis of 100 pupils. 
Thus, if the sum of the individual scores of a class of 27 
pupils is 157.3, the class score on the basis of 100 pupils 
would be %7<157.8—582.59. 
Accuracy. The scores so obtained measure only the
-P-A-G-E-293
/ 
MEASURING RESULTS 287 
speed of the pupils’ reasoning. The accuracy of the reason- 
ing or the per cent of problems reasoned correctly may also 
be figured. It is found by dividing the number of prob- 
lems reasoned correctly by the total number attempted. 
In figuring the accuracy of an individual pupil, fractions 
should be used, if necessary, in counting both the number 
correct and the number attempted. In figuring the ac- 
euracy of a group of fifty or more pupils, however, it is 
sufficiently accurate to count only the number of problems 
entirely correct and to neglect problems started but not 
completed in counting the number attempted. 
Standards. Stone has recently proposed the following 
tentative standards:

series, the first being intended for grades 4 and 5, the 
second for grades 6 and 7, and the third for grade 8. The 
papers are graded both for correct principle and correct 
answer and separate scores are kept. The problems on a 
given test are not of equal difficulty but are assigned dif- 
ferent values. Thus in Test I in the third problem, 3 
points are given for correct principle and 2 for correct 
answer (P=3, C=—2). The time for each test is 25 min- 
utes. The tests follow: 
Test I. For Grades 4 and 5 
1. Mr. Black received $2 a yd. for broadcloth. He sold 
78 yds. How much did he receive? (P=2, C=2.)

5X9=45 8X9=72 
6X9=54 
Add 9 to 72. 
9X9=81. 
10X9=90. Method of Procedure 
How many like to play baseball? 
We have on the board a game called 
“Making a Home Run.” Look at the 
figure in the center of the diamond. 
To play this game and make a home 
run, we have to multiply 9 by the 
numbers at each corner. 
What shall we need to know in 
order to make a score? 
Who can give the first combination? 
Give the next one. 
Does it make any difference in the 
product whether we say 3X9 or 9X3? 
How many are 9X3? Then how 
many are 3X9? 
Using what we have learned in our 
other tables, how far do we really 
know the table of 9’s? I will write 
the combinations and you give the 
product. 
If eight 9’s are 72, how could you 
find nine 9’s? 
Mary, tell us the product of 9x9. 
How many are 109? 
(11X9 and 129 are developed in 
the same way.)

need to put the most study? 
Study 9X9 and 109; look away 
from the board and say them. I will 
erase the answers. Write the com- 
binations on your papers. Study the 
last two combinations. I will erase 
the answers and you may write them 
on your papers. Study. 
Are you ready to play the game? 
Who can make first base? 
Who can get from first base to 
second?

to make the necessary corrections and 
suggestions. Such things, for exam-

duction of the answer, may call for 
criticism.)

Very well, let us subtract the frac- 
tions. What difficulty do you find? 
Can anyone suggest something to do? 
When we subtracted a mixed number 
from an integer, as in this example, 
(referring to one previously worked at. 
the board; 20—8%.) and found we 
had nothing to subtract the fraction 
from, what did we have to do? Don’t 
you think it might help us to do that 
here? 
To what whole number and fraction 
would you change 14? 
What have we now, instead of 
14842? 
That makes 13 and how many 
12ths? 
Now can we subtract the fractions? 
You may finish the example, and I’ll 
write your answer. 
Read the answer. What was the 
only new thing we did in this exam- 
ple? (Changing the minuend.) 
Do you think you can work one 
now? Let us work one more together. 
T'll write it on the board. See if you 
can tell me just what to do, without 
my helping you. (Call on various in- 
dividuals for the different steps.) 
The class may pass to the board, 
and we'll see if each of you can do 
this kind of subtraction example now.

whole book is one long story and the 
story is divided into chapters.

start for school, have recess, and go 
home at noon are handled in the

Drill: Changing Fractions to Higher Terms 
Fifth Grade* 
Subject Matter 
To change a fraction to 
higher terms multiply both 
the numerator and the de- 
nominator by the same 
number. 
Multiplying or dividing 
both terms of a fraction by 
the same number does not 
change the value of the 
fraction.

at a time.) Procedure 
Yesterday we learned how to change 
fractions to higher terms. We all 
understand how to do the work, but 
we haven’t had practice enough to do 
it quickly and easily. We shall have 
to use this process very often as we 
go on with our work in fractions, and 
if we can’t do it readily, we'll be 
hampered in our new work. You 
have been anxious to learn how to 
add fractions. Just as soon as you 
can change fractions to higher terms, 
you'll be ready for the addition. So 
let’s see if we can’t get enough prac- 
tice today to help each one to do the 
work quickly and correctly. 
How many can tell how to change 
a fraction to higher terms? 
What principle did we discover a 
few days ago, that gives us the right 
to do this? 
We'll take a few very easy ones 
first, in order to be sure that every- 
one remembers just how to do them. 
You may tell us by what number you 
will multiply the numerator and de- 
nominator, and then read your ex- 
ample with its answer.

    APPENDIX 325 
Read these statements, supplying 
the missing numbers. 
Those who made mistakes in any 
of these, stand. Have you any ques- 
tion on them now? Take the ones 
you had trouble with, once more. 
Change the fractions outside of the 
circle to 12ths. We'll begin with Rob- 
ert and go right around the class. 
If anyone makes a mistake, the next 
person be sure to correct it. Change 
the fraction to which I point. (Point 
to the fractions first in rotation, then 
out of order.) : 
Now I'd like several people to be- 
gin and go entirely around the circle 
without making a mistake. Who is 
ready to try? (Call on several.) 
(Change ?/12 in center of circle to 
?/24.) Robert, you may take the 
pointer and call on whomever you 
wish to recite. You may ask the 
class to work in any way you wish. 
Change the fraction in the center 
to as many of the denominators on 
the outside, as possible. Beginning 
with 4ths, go around the circle toward 
the right. (Change % to %, %, etc.) 
In your books is a list of fractions 
to be changed to higher terms. You 
may write the answers only, and we'll 
see how many can write every answer 
correctly in one minute. Open books 
to page 44. The list is at the top of 
the page. Ready. Begin— (Time 
the class.) Time. You may check 
mistakes as I read answers. How 
many had them all right? Those who 
made mistakes, stand. Read the ones 
you missed, correcting the mistakes. 
Tomorrow we shall learn how to 
add fractions.

consecutively. Method of Procedure 
How did your scores in the Courtis 
Test compare with the class median 
given you? 
The last time the Studebaker Test 
was taken, only a few finished the 
cards. What does this indicate? 
Before taking the tests today, let 
us spend some time drilling. 
Give answers quickly and quietly 
to the addition combinations as they 
are held up. Class correct mistakes. 
1st. In concert. 
2nd. By rows. 
3rd. Individuals. 
4th. Boys. 
5th. Girls. 
6th. One pupil who needs extra 
drill. 
Give answers to the column of fig- 
ures placed upon board and then 
quickly erased. 
Let us drill upon subtraction. 
J—— may subtract first. |

Pupils have cut from local 
newspapers advertisements 
of sales, especially those 
mentioning per cent. 
Pupils suggest— 
Merchants want to dispose 
of odd pieces, and goods that 
are going out of style or 
season, to encourage buying 
in dull seasons, to bring new 
customers to the store, etc. 
Advertisement. 25% dis- 
count on any chair in this 
special display.

(b) Rate of discount. 
(c) Marked price. 
(d) Net price. 
Other similar problems 
based on advertisements. Procedure 
Read one of your advertisements. 
Why are these put in the papers? 
If you should go to that store and 
find a chair marked $20, for how much 
less than the marked priced would 
you get it? 
What would you have to pay for 
the chair? 
Same procedure. The terms “dis- 
count,” “net price,” etc., are used. 
For tomorrow make up and solve 
five problems from data given in

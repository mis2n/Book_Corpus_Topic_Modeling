  Preface 
In the pages that follow there has been no at- 
tempt at comprehensive accounts of the educational 
institutions named therein. Even had the requi- 
site space for such treatment been available it would 
have been foreign to the purpose of the book it- 
self. That purpose, briefly stated, was to supply a 
readable, though necessarily superficial description 
of nine American preparatory schools, touching but 
lightly on their scholastic side, yet giving within 
certain prescribed limits such impressions as the aver- 
age observer would obtain in the course of a visit 
to each, together with some little account of their 
history in each case. The most of readers will prob- 
ably find themselves more or less familiar with the 
history and customs of at least one school among the 
nine, but few persons, it is probable, are equally well 
acquainted with them all. To convey such informa-

tion in as unaggressive, non-professional a manner 
as is consistent with furnishing it at all has, there- 
fore, been the aim of the author. The book is not 
intended to take the place of separate volumes de- 
voted to the schools in question, but rather to stimu- 
late a desire for such monographs, while at the 
same time answering the more important of the 
queries likely to arise in the minds of many regarding 
these particular schools. 
In the course of his work the author has experi- 
enced the greatest courtesy from the heads of the 
schools here discussed, and while he may not thank - 
by name all who have thus materially contributed to 
his assistance he cannot, without seeming ungrateful, 
omit mention of the Reverend Simon J. Blum, the 
principal of Nazareth Hall; Doctor J. Milnor Coit, 
acting rector of Saint Paul’s; Alfred E. Stearns, 
B. A., vice-principal of Phillips Andover; George D. 
Jefferson, Esq., secretary of Groton School; Harlan 
Page Amen, A.M., principal of Phillips Exeter; 
Reverend Simon John MacPherson, head master of 
Lawrenceville; and T. Dean Swift, the secretary of

the last-named school, as having by their cordial co- 
operation with him, and ready sacrifice of time in 
his behalf, placed him under especial obligations. 
To them, as to the others whom he has not named, 
he desires in this place to express his sincerest 
thanks, as well as to acknowledge his further in- 
debtedness to Mr. Elmer Ellsworth Brown’s excel- 
lent recent volume, ‘The Making of Our Middle 
Schools.”

Some Famous American 
Schools 
  Introduction 
OTWITHSTANDING their common lan- 
N guage and literature, educated English- 
men and Americans occasionally find 
themselves at a loss as to the other’s meaning 
in what appear like very simple matters indeed, 
and perhaps this occurs as often as anywhere 
with regard to the school systems of the two coun- 
tries of England and the United States. The aver- 
age untravelled American speaks glibly of public and 
private schools, of grammar and high schools, of 
Latin schools, and perhaps of English high schools 
also. Nor does he imagine that any meaning can be 
rT
-P-A-G-E-14
  2 Some Famous American Schools 
attached to these terms other than what he under- 
  stands them to mean. The Englishman in his turn 
talks of grammar schools, of public schools, and, but 
less often, of high schools, nor does it readily enter 
his head that there can be more than one interpreta- 
tion of the terms. 
But let these worthy persons meet, and it pres- 
ently becomes apparent to both that their com- 
mon language is either less or more than they had 
fancied it was, for they have hecome involved in a 
tangle of misunderstandings while employing only 
the very plainest words, as it seemed to each. In 
time they may arrive at a mutual understanding by 
themselves, but the intervention of a third person 
rather better versed than either in the differences 
between “Englishman’s English,” and “ United 
States English” may become necessary to set them 
again upon their conversational feet. 
Through his friendly offices the American learns 
for the first time that an English public school is 
what he himself would style a private school; that 
an English high school, while occasionally in the
-P-A-G-E-15
Introduction 8 
midland towns corresponding to what he knows by 
that name, is more often a small private educational 
establishment of no especial significance; and that 
what in America is called a public school, English- 
men denominate a “board school,” with just that 
amount of superiority in the tone that fixes their 
distance relatively from the class which depends 
upon the board school for the education of its youth. 
The Englishman now learns that when the Ameri- 
can speaks of a grammar school he does not mean 
to refer to an institution corresponding to those an- 
cient foundations in English towns and villages 
where the grammar taught is that of Greece and 
Rome, and which may or may not be free (which is 
what the American supposes a public school must of 
necessity be), but to a certain grade of institution, 
corresponding to the “board school,” where the 
grammar is of the English tongue. The “ Latin 
school ” of American speech he finds to be a classical 
school corresponding in some particulars, though by 
no means in all, to the grammar schools of Great 
Britain, but the exact scope of an “ English high
-P-A-G-E-16
  4 Some Famous American Schools 
school” perhaps never makes itself quite clear to 
him. 
Well is it for their mutual comprehension if the 
Englishman refrain from mention of National or 
British schools, and the American remain reticent 
as to academies and normal schools. Still, when 
the American has taken in the idea that such famous 
institutions as Rugby, Harrow, Eton, and Win- 
chester, which the Englishman will persist in styling 
public, are in their intent, at least, paralleled here 
by the academies of Exeter and Andover, and the 
schools of Saint Paul’s, Saint Mark’s, and others of 
their type, he will not find much difficulty in translat- 
ing his own phrase of “normal school or college” 
into “Training School for Schoolmasters,” or 
“ Schoolmistresses,” as the case may be. And by the 
time the Englishman has perceived the points of 
likeness between certain American academies and 
Harrow or Eton, the American is prepared to re- 
ceive with meekness the information that a National 
school is one supported by the national or Established 
Church, and a British school, which one might fancy
-P-A-G-E-17
  Introduction 5 
- 
to be even more “ national,” is one sustained by two 
or more bodies of nonconformists, in distinction 
from one supported by a single body, such as a 
Unitarian or Wesleyan school. 
Speaking broadly, then, by the term “ public 
school,” the Englishman means to indicate an insti- 
tution preparatory to the university, having Eton, 
Rugby, or some other famous name in mind. 
Schools parallel in their intent, and to some extent 
in their plan, have existed in the United States for 
considerably more than a century under the general 
term of academies in some instances, or private 
schools in others, but it is since the close of the 
American Civil War, in 1865, that they have become 
a more influential factor in American education. 
Where one such institution existed prior to that year, 
twenty may be counted now. The necessity for their 
presence, by no means generally recognized scarce 
a generation ago, is willingly enough conceded at 
present. 
But the grammar school, as the Englishman 
knows it, was not unknown to the American of the
-P-A-G-E-18
    6 Some Famous American Schools 
Colonial period. The General Court of Massachu- 
setts granted in 1659 one thousand acres each to the 
towns of Charlestown, Cambridge, and Dorchester 
for the support of grammar schools. In 1671, the 
former fine of five pounds levied on towns of one 
hundred families for neglecting to provide grammar 
schools was increased to ten, and in 1683 to twenty 
pounds in the case of towns of two hundred families. 
It was provided, moreover, in the latter year that 
every town of more than five hundred families should 
provide two grammar schools. 
So ran the law, but it must be said that it was only 
with the utmost difficulty that the towns of the Com- 
monwealth were made to live up to its provisions. 
Connecticut and New Hampshire followed the lead 
of Massachusetts in the matter of grammar schools, 
and no doubt their citizens had to be as frequently 
reminded of their neglect of duty. Maryland also 
established secondary schools of the same character, 
but here, again, legislation was invoked to hold the 
people to their obligations. 
As the seventeenth century advanced the grammar
-P-A-G-E-19
Introduction g 
schools showed evidences of declining. The frontier 
was being slowly but constantly pushed westward, 
and the newer towns, struggling for the bare necessi- 
ties of existence, were opposed to compulsory legis- 
Tation for the purposes of education, as the older 
ones became negligent in respect to it in many in- 
stances. The early Puritan settlers had been an 
educated, and, in the case of the clergy, a very 
learned body, even, while the generation immediately 
succeeding had been imbued with much of the same 
spirit, but, with increase of population, education 
ceased to hold the preéminence it had maintained in 
the first days of the Puritan colonies. 
But, though dormant, the old love of learning was 
far from being dead, and it made itself evident in 
many directions. When William Dummer, who had 
been lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts, died in 
1761, he bequeathed his house and three-hundred- 
acre farm in Byfield parish, in the town of Newbury, 
to establish a grammar school. It was a noteworthy 
gift and noteworthy results were to ensue from it. 
The first master of the school which the Dummer  
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 Some Famous American Schools 
bequest made possible was Samuel Moody, who not 
only constituted a grammar school of the original 
type, principally concerned with fitting lads for 
college, but devoted much attention to the matter of 
physical exercise and was himself the leader and 
director of his boys in the matter of swimming. He 
was probably not the earliest New England school- 
master to encourage athletics, and although Benja- 
min Franklin in his plan for an academy set forth 
in 1743 had strongly recommended the practice of 
sports, yet Master Moody furnishes perhaps the most 
eminent example of their encouragement from such 
a source in the colonies in the eighteenth century. 
Dummer Academy, as Master Moody’s grammar 
school came to be called later, sent many lads to 
Harvard College in those early years of its existence 
under his fostering care inthe classics as in athletics, 
and of one of his pupils prepared by him for Har- 
vard, Samuel Phillips by name, we shall hear more 
in a subsequent chapter. 
However unfamiliar the term academy may now 
be to English ears in general, it was otherwise in
-P-A-G-E-21
      Introduction 9 
the eighteenth century, when academies might be 
found in many a locality, both urban and rural. In 
the larger number of instances these were under non- 
conformist influence and aimed at giving to the 
sons of nonconformists, excluded from the uni- 
versities, such instruction as should parallel that 
offered at the great public schools. The academy 
movement in England, then, was an outgrowth of 
nonconformity. In America the movement had a 
somewhat different genesis. 
The grammar schools of the preceding century 
had not answered to all the expectations formed for 
them, partly through the growing indifference to 
classical education in the newer communities among 
the classes below the professional, and the small 
number of the leisure class then existing in Colonial 
life. A similar indifference appeared to be spreading 
in the older towns as well, evidenced by the lack of 
support the grammar schools were receiving. It was 
very apparent then, that if the wealthier colonists de- 
sired to have their sons trained for college or to 
pursue their education farther than the ordinary 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
    
10 Some Famous American Schools 
schools afforded the opportunity for doing it, schools 
must be established by private initiative. The school 
that presently became known as Dummer Academy 
was one of the very earliest examples of such initia- 
tive. So were Lower Marlborough Academy and 
one or two others which came into being in Mary- 
land during the period of the Revolution. 
The founding of the two Phillips Academies fol- 
lowed very soon, and to these succeeded Leicester 
Academy in Massachusetts, in 1784, with others soon 
after, till, ere the century’s end, there were academies 
dotted all along the Atlantic seaboard, founded by 
private enterprise, each endeavouring to give an edu- 
cation in advance of the purely elementary, and in 
very many cases performing their task of preparing 
lads for college in very commendable fashion. 
“ The academy age,” says a recent writer, “ was, 
in fact, the age of transition from the partially strati- 
fied Colonial society to modern democracy. The rise 
of the academies was closely connected with the rise 
of the middle class. The academies were by no 
means exclusively middle-class schools at the start,
-P-A-G-E-23
Introduction Il 
and they became something very different from that 
at a later period.” But from the dawn of the nine- 
teenth century till its fiftieth milestone was passed, 
the academy was the dominant educational institution 
in America. 
The academy as it was then has had its day and 
ceased to be, and the institutions that yet preserve 
the name are in most cases quite different from the 
average academy of two generations ago, with differ- 
ent aims and more comprehensive methods. The 
few great modern academies whose names come 
readily to the mind have approached year by year 
more nearly to the model furnished by the great 
public schools of England, and with them are classed 
such similar institutions in scope and general plan, as 
Saint Paul’s, Saint Mark’s, Lawrenceville, and some 
others that might be named in this connection. 
These various institutions agreeing in their central 
aim, that of providing a broad base for the university 
education that is to follow, have yet preserved a dis- 
tinctive individuality, and, with many points of 
resemblance, present as many, and perhaps as inter-
-P-A-G-E-24

esting and instructive, points of unlikeness, also. Of 
a few of these great middle schools it falls within 
the province of this volume to speak in more or 
less discursive fashion.

Nazareth Hall 
ILLIAM PENN and Zinzendorf: these 
\ \) are verily names to conjure with in Penn- 
sylvania history, and one comes upon 
them both in the annals of Nazareth Hall. In the 
midst of a rolling agricultural region midway be- 
tween the Blue and South Mountains in Northamp- 
ton County lies what could till recently have been 
very accurately termed “the retired” village of 
Nazareth. But from its retirement of one hundred 
and fifty years it has emerged within the last four, 
for it is now the goal of two electric-car lines from 
Easton and one from Bethlehem, and the erection 
of several cement works has not only added to the 
number of its industries, but very materially to its 
dwellings and population. The Moravians of an 
older generation, surveying the changes from their 
ancient stone houses, are most probably led to the 
15 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 Some Famous American Schools 
reflection that, while seclusion may have some pains, 
publicity, so far as they are concerned, can have few 
pleasures. 
There was seclusion enough and to spare, one 
would have imagined, when in 1682 William Penn 
granted to his daughter Letitia some five thousand 
acres in the Forks of the Delaware, on the condition 
as unexacting as it was romantic, that service should 
be rendered to him and his heirs forever, if de- 
manded, by paying a red rose in June of each year. 
This was the only estate in the colony invested with 
the right of court baron, and it was known, on this 
account, as the Barony Nazareth. 
How tenaciously the proprietaries insisted upon 
their yearly red roses, or how long the fragrant 
tribute continued to be paid, history does not say, 
but the Barony Nazareth was bought from William 
Allen of Philadelphia, in 1740, by the famous White- 
field, who intended to build here a school for negroes 
and a home for his followers compelled to leave 
England for conscience’ sake. The school building, 
which he partially completed, still stands in Nazareth,
-P-A-G-E-29
  NAZARETH HALL, BUILT IN 1755.
-P-A-G-E-30

-P-A-G-E-31
Nazareth Hall 19 
and is known as Whitefield House, but his plans were 
hindered of their fulfilment, and in 1741 he was 
obliged to sell the estate, which was then purchased 
by Bishop Spangenberg of the Moravian body. 
It seems to have then become the property of the 
Countess Zinzendorf, and in 1755 a manor-house 
was begun, and completed the next year as a resi- 
dence for the Count Zinzendorf when he should 
next revisit America. His death prevented the 
carrying out of this arrangement, but the great struc- 
ture was of much service to the Moravian Brethren, 
who occupied it in 1757 for the purposes of a Synod, 
whose members were escorted to and from the meet- 
ing by armed men as a protection from the hostile 
Indians of the neighbourhood. The Moravians 
were men of peace, but, like other non-militant 
Christians, were sometimes forced to depend upon 
the good offices of those of more martial mould. 
In 1759 a new chapter in the history of the Barony 
Nazareth and of the Zinzendorf manor-house was 
begun, for in that year a boarding-school was opened 
in the building for Moravian youth. A communistic  
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 Some Famous American Schools 
system prevailed among the Unitas Fratrum, to use 
the official title of the church, and the boys attending 
the school were educated at the expense of the 
Moravian body. In 1762 this system came to an 
end, and as an immediate result the Nazareth school 
was reduced in numbers and in 1779 was closed. 
But not for long did the stately structure, which 
had been built after the plan of a Silesian manor- 
house, the better to please the good Count who was 
destined never to see it, cease to echo the sound of 
boyish feet. The Moravians had obtained new light 
in the meantime, and when the Revolution was over 
it was decided to admit other than sons of Moravians 
to the school, and accordingly, in 1785, Nazareth 
Hall began its second career of usefulness, this time 
as a “ Pedagogium, or Boarding-school.” In this 
twentieth century an institution which announced 
itself as a “ Pedagogium ” would be doomed to fail- 
ure from the start, but either people cared less about 
names and more about things in the closing years of 
the eighteenth century than do their descendants, or 
else the name may have struck popular fancy as
-P-A-G-E-33
  Nazareth Hall 21 
musical, or peculiarly fitting, or what not, for the 
fame of the “ Pedagogium” soon spread abroad 
in the land, and from Europe and various parts of 
the United States, as well as from the isles of the 
sea, boys came to the Barony Nazareth as the faithful 
to the birthplace of the Prophet. By 1810 two 
hundred and ninety boys had been entered on the 
school rolls, surely a very creditable showing for the 
time and place. 
It was not precisely a cloistered existence that 
was led by the “ Brethren,” as the instructors in 
those far-off days were called, but their naive, child- 
like simplicity and unfamiliarity with the customs 
and thought of the world outside of the Barony 
Nazareth finds its only counterpart in the cloister of 
some secluded convent. It was the custom at Naza- 
reth to hold monthly meetings of the Brethren 
teachers, of which written records were kept and 
which seem to have commonly closed with a series 
of recommendations as to school management and 
discipline. These ‘‘ Minutes of the Monthly Meet- 
ings in Nazareth School for Exercises in Reading
-P-A-G-E-34
  22 Some Famous American Schools 
and Speaking ” have all been preserved in manuscript 
volumes in which the handwriting is as clear and 
sharp as if penned but yesterday, though the earliest 
is dated 1785. 
The minutes for July 3, 1794, for instance, begin 
with an enumeration of the names of “ scholars who 
learn Latin,” followed by those of “ scholars who do 
not learn Latin.” And after these comes the signifi- 
cant entry : “ the scholar who learns nothing: Nathan 
Ray Green.” Whether it was pure obstinacy on 
the part of young Nathan that is here taken note of, 
or simple inability to acquire knowledge, we are not 
told, nor shall we ever know. For aught we learn to 
the contrary, Nathan may have been in most things 
an attractive, engaging child enough, or a sullen 
youth the key to whose nature was never found by 
the Brethren. In either case his has been the hard 
fate of being pilloried for over a century as “the 
scholar who learns nothing.” 
One might linger long over these unique records 
of school life overpast. “It is recommended,” 
say the Brethren more than once, that “ the scholars
-P-A-G-E-35
     
Nazareth Hall 23 
shall not approach the cyder mill,” perhaps a wise 
recommendation, and undoubtedly so is a further 
recommendation found a few pages subsequently, to 
the effect that “the scholars should not eat unripe 
apples.” The suggestions cover a wide range, and 
recommendations against cursing are interspersed 
with others relating to the weekly bath (more fre- 
quent ablutions were distinctly discouraged by the 
Brethren) and moral conduct. Nor were the recom- 
mendations suffered to remain as recommendations 
solely. They were enforced by a system of fines: “ A 
farthing for talking at meals, a ha’penny for falling 
on the floor, 1d for tearing a leaf out of a book, 2d 
for telling a lie, 3d for an oath.” The way of 
transgressors was expensive, from the schoolboy 
point of view, in the Barony Nazareth a century 
ago. 
The first principal of Nazareth Hall after its 
reopening was the Reverend Charles Reichel, who 
held sway from 1785 to 1803, and he has been suc- 
ceeded by fifteen others, all Moravian clergymen, the 
present incumbent, the Reverend Simon J. Blum, 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
    24 Some Famous American Schools 
having been in charge from 1897. The assistants 
have usually been, till recent years at any rate, gradu- 
ates from the Moravian Theological Seminary and 
candidates for the ministry. A different policy has 
prevailed of late, for it has been recognized that 
persons who use the profession of teaching but as a 
stepping-stone to another profession may not be the 
best possible instructors of ingenuous youth. 
In other ways, moreover, the management of the 
institution has been affected by changing sentiment. 
The revenues of the institution, after the necessary 
expenses were paid, were formerly devoted to the 
general work of the Moravian Church, a system by 
which the church at large was benefited at the ex- 
pense of the school. Had the surplus earnings been 
devoted to endowment purposes, Nazareth Hall 
might now rank in equipment and efficiency with the 
foremost schools of its class. At present they are 
expended for equipment and kindred uses, but the 
assistance of loyal alumni is very much needed to 
place Nazareth Hall where it is, by right of long and 
honourable service, certainly entitled to be.

The business centre of Nazareth is in South Main 
Street, in the vicinity of the Nazareth Inn. Here 
are the shops, the banks, and an unusually large 
number of ice-cream establishments, the goal of 
Nazareth Hall lads on half-holidays, possibly. A 
very little to the north of this quarter is the tiny 
town square, facing which, on the west side, is a very 
large brick Moravian church with tall steeple and a 
town clock. Beside it a street leads southward, and 
a stone’s throw in this direction brings one in front 
of a green surrounded on three sides by a group of 
pale yellow structures constituting Nazareth Hall. 
The land rises to the rear, and there are clumps of 
woodland visible in this direction, and well-tilled 
farming lands. In front the view to southward takes 
in a wide extent of rolling countryside, with the 
Lehigh Hills bounding the horizon, and the smoke 
from Bethlehem factories, ten miles distant, blurring 
their outlines. 
An Old World aspect the famous school presents 
as one sees it from the roadway. In the centre, and 
forming the north side of the quadrangle, is the
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 Some Famous American Schools 
original manor-house, after the Silesian model fol- 
lowed by the early Moravians in America, of lime- 
stone covered with rough cast, like the other struc- 
tures near it. It is of three stories, with a gambrel 
roof, the latter adorned with a balustrade and ‘a 
spired cupola. The walls are two feet thick, for it 
was needful in the middle of the eighteenth century 
to be prepared to sustain an Indian attack in this 
quarter of Pennsylvania, but in this matter it is quite 
probable that its conservative Moravian builders were 
but copying their Silesian model. Its admirable pro- 
portions were seriously marred by the three-storied 
addition on the east made a generation ago, but in 
the accompanying view this is fortunately hidden by 
the clump of firs to the right. 
There is little here to offend the architectural 
sense. While none of the buildings can be properly 
styled beautiful, entire absence of pretence is in itself 
a virtue, and their dignified, substantial aspect is 
very grateful to the eye. The ancient Zinzendorf 
manor-house conveys at once the impression of sta- 
bility, and this is borne out by the appearance of its

  DINING HALL AT NAZARETH. 
Built in the Seventeenth Century and formerly the “ Sister House” of 
the Moravian Community. 
 
-P-A-G-E-40

neighbours. On the east of the quadrangle is a tall 
stone structure, considerably over a century old, 
originally the sister house of the community, when 
communistic life was practised by the church. Its 
lower floor is now the dining-hall of the institution, 
the upper stories serving other uses of the school. 
The west side of the quadrangle is formed by the 
principal’s residence, also a building of age and 
substance, with a superb winding staircase in its 
wide hall worth going a long way to see, and next 
south of this a building occupied by the boys of the 
senior class, and next to this, in turn, a disused 
church whose upper floor is devoted to the uses of 
a historical society, while its spacious lower story 
serves as a gymnasium. This structure is not at 
present owned by the school, but it is hoped that 
the alumni may one day feel moved to present it 
to the institution, when its present capabilities will 
very probably be extended by the addition of a 
swimming-pool, for which a brawling brook close at 
hand offers tempting possibilities in the way of 
water-supply. 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  
30 Some Famous American Schools 
More completely than any other school hereinafter 
described Nazareth exemplifies the loco parentis 
principle in school government, in which matter it 
is merely following out the intentions of its early 
founders. It is a principle that has been continu- 
ously tested in Moravian institutions in Europe and 
in America for a century and more, and there are 
no present evidences of change in this particular. 
Perhaps the contrast is greater between Nazareth 
and Exeter, in regard to governing principles, than 
between any other two institutions we shall consider, 
and probably each school would look askance at the 
system pursued at the other. But while each might 
claim that its method had worked well it might be 
exceedingly difficult to prove that it would not 
have prospered even more under the opposite sys- 
tem. 
The ninety or a hundred pupils at Nazareth are 
divided, mainly according to age, into five room 
companies, each having its apartment for study and 
dwelling purposes and one or more dormitories. 
Each company is placed under the charge of one or

-P-A-G-E-44

-P-A-G-E-45
  
Nazareth Hall 33 
more masters, alternately on duty for a day at a 
time, from their downsitting to their uprising in a 
very literal sense. Not only are the assistant masters 
with their charges during the hours of study and 
recitation, but they accompany the boys to church 
and chapel, as well as to meals, are expected to be 
with them on the playgrounds, as well as on their 
excursions and walks, and at night they sleep in the 
same dormitory with the members of their especial 
room company. Precisely how pillow fights can be 
successfully conducted under the wakeful eyes of 
two masters whose beds are on opposite sides of the 
large dormitory or sleeping-hall, it is not easy to 
understand. And yet the temptations to this par- 
ticular form of athletic exercise must be very great. 
In the opinion of many parents the strictly pa- 
rental system pursued at Nazareth minimizes the dis- 
advantages of boarding-school life, and in the case 
of the younger pupils much may be said in its 
favour. When the older lads are considered there 
may be honest differences of opinion on the point. 
But however desirable the system may be for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  34 Some Famous American Schools 
boys themselves, it cannot be said that it materially 
increases the joys of living for the masters. One 
may admire boyish character never so much and yet 
not particularly desire its uninterrupted contempla- 
tion for all of the hours of the twenty-four. More- 
over such constant, unrelieved association with juve- 
nile life has its narrowing effect upon the mind of 
the master. After a time he loses his sense of per- 
spective, attaches undue importance to trifles, and 
is disposed to judge of the world at large by the 
ethical and other standards of the schoolroom. And 
this narrowness must inevitably react upon his 
teaching. The head master, whose field is wider, 
who by the exigencies of his position is compelled 
to mingle daily with other men, experiences little 
or nothing of this; it is the master whose duties 
require his presence with his charges day and night, 
who undergoes the dwarfing process. 
In certain details the system at Nazareth makes 
strong appeal to careful mothers. For instance the 
clothing of the lads is kept in a large apartment 
called the Clothes Room, in charge of an attendant
-P-A-G-E-47
Nazareth Hall 35 
who at stated times supplies each lad with what 
he may require, and attends to the proper care of 
the clothing in addition. 
On Sundays the pupils attend worship in the 
Moravian church of the town, and on week-days 
there are morning and evening devotions in the 
school chapel; neither of them irksome exercises as 
regards length. Nearly the entire lower floor of the 
manor-house is occupied as a chapel and general 
assembly room, a spacious, dignified apartment not 
wholly unchurchly in appearance, and with several 
marble tablets upon its walls. The schoolrooms 
are situated on the floor above, and above this, in 
turn, are the rooms occupied as dormitories for all 
but the seniors. 
It may chance that when the visitor takes his first 
look at Nazareth the echoes of this ordinarily quiet 
neighbourhood are vociferous with the roll of drums, 
the scream of the fife, or the shrill call of the bugle, 
sounds well calculated to upset one’s preconceived 
opinions as to the peace-loving proclivities of the 
Unitas Fratrum, when supplemented by the sight of 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 Some Famous American Schools 
uniformed cadets marching and countermarching 
with murderous-looking muskets across the turf of 
the quadrangle. Moravians and muskets! What 
an unexpected combination! One would as soon 
associate in one’s mind Dunkers and dumdum 
bullets, Mennonites and Maxim guns, Quakers and 
lyddite shells. 
The staunchest peace principles nevertheless find 
it sometimes impossible to withstand a particular 
strain imposed upon them, and in the early months 
of the American Civil War, in accordance with the 
prevailing sentiment, military discipline was estab- 
lished at Nazareth as a means of physical exercise, 
as in many another school at that period, and has 
ever since been continued. There are three com- 
panies forming the Hall battalion, a remarkably full 
complement of officers enabling rather more than 
one-third of the cadets to occupy positions of author- 
ity dear to boyish hearts. A fairly strict military 
discipline is also maintained, guard duty and extra 
drill being imposed as punishments, with Reveille
-P-A-G-E-49
          Nazareth Hall a7 
beginning the day at 6.15 a.m. and Taps ending it 
at 9.15 at night. 
That the military part of the school’s history is 
not altogether a matter of uniforms and peaceful 
marching upon green turf is evidenced by the pres- 
ence in the midst of the lawn of a monumental shaft 
to the memory of “‘ the Sons of Nazareth Hall who 
died that their Country might be Healed and Live” 
during the Civil War. There are twenty-eight 
whose names are thus commemorated, and the 
records of the institution further reveal that, in 
addition to these twenty-eight, two hundred and six 
Nazareth Hall graduates entered the army and navy 
of the United States at this period; twenty-eight 
served in the Confederate army and navy, five of 
whom died in that service; three became generals 
in the Confederate service, and five in that of the 
Federal army, with one who became a fleet engi- 
neer. The sons of a professedly militant institution 
could scarcely have hearkened more readily to 
the call of country than these heroes who had
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 Some Famous American Schools 
been trained under the care of the peaceful Unitas 
Fratrum. 
The age of admission to Nazareth is from nine to 
sixteen, and besides the preparation for ordinary 
business life the college preparatory course is de- 
signed to fit pupils for entrance to college or techni- 
cal schools, the college haven of the largest number 
appearing to be Lafayette at Easton, at which, as 
well as at Lehigh University and the Moravian Col- 
lege at Bethlehem, Nazareth graduates are admitted 
without examination. 
In an upper room of the seniors’ house is a print- 
ing-office managed by the cadets, where the school 
periodical, a monthly, entitled The Hail Boy, is 
printed. The presswork is done entirely by the 
students, and a very creditable piece of work it is. 
In its one hundred and eighteen years of con- 
tinuous life, counting from 1785, nearly four thou- 
sand boys have been graduated from the school, 
and not a few of the number have risen to eminence. 
Among graduates of recent years one comes upon 
the name of the new cabinet Secretary of Commerce 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  Nazareth Hall 39 
and labour, George B. Cortelyou, the private sec- 
retary of Presidents McKinley and Roosevelt, who 
entered Nazareth Hall at the age of eleven. 
Of the nine schools of which some description is 
attempted in this volume, Nazareth is the only one 
whose rates for board and tuition make it possible 
for persons of limited income to consider it with 
relation to the education of their sons. Other 
schools there are of excellence whose charges are 
moderate, but they are not very numerous, and 
among those selected for comment here Nazareth 
alone offers preparation for college at rates adapted 
to slender purses, as has just been said. But like 
many other schools of its class, it stands sorely in 
need of both scholarships and endowment. With 
its forty acres of farm and other land surrounding 
its buildings, it has ample room to grow, and when, 
either by the changed policy of the Moravian Church 
or by the generosity of alumni, its equipment and 
resources are increased, we may look to see the 
ancient institution of the Barony Nazareth take its 
place beside the great American schools of its type,
-P-A-G-E-52
    
40 Some Famous American Schools 
differing from them, as they in turn differ from each 
other, but in no sense their inferior. 
Although under the control of the Moravian 
Church, the school is not sectarian, and under its 
present head-mastership anything approaching to 
sectarianism is unlikely to flourish. The chapel exer- 
cises are of such a character as to be acceptable to 
persons of very diverse faiths, and the Sunday at- 
tendance at the Moravian church in the town is not 
devised with any intention of making young Mora- 
vians of the cadets. 
Regarding the advisability of the loco parentis 
system, which is followed to a very considerable 
degree at Saint Paul’s and Saint Mark’s, and to a 
lesser extent at one or two more of the schools 
here discussed, but which finds its completest ex- 
emplification at Nazareth, opinions will long con- 
tinue to differ. As a system it has its undoubted 
advantages from several points of view. Whether 
these advantages are or not overbalanced by the 
disadvantages is for parents to determine, and the 
degree of success attained at Nazareth under its
-P-A-G-E-53
  Nazareth Hall 41 
pursuance entitles its management to respectful 
consideration. 
And when all is said, and the dust of argument 
has finally cleared away, it will be found that youth 
have thriven under the operation of theories the 
most diverse, and that the real end of education has 
usually been attained after all, whether the plan has 
been that of Nazareth or Exeter.

-P-A-G-E-57
Phillips Andover Academy 
N the class which went forth from Harvard 
I College in 1771, sixty-three in number, was one 
Samuel Phillips, the son of a former master of 
the grammar school at Andover. His name will be 
found seventh on the class roll, but originally it 
was the eighth, the change being made at the request 
of the father, who explained, no doubt with the 
seriousness demanded on such an occasion, that his 
social position entitled the lad to the better place. 
His request provoked discussion, however, the out- 
come of which was the discontinuance at the college 
of the custom of placing students according to the 
social standing of their fathers. 
But Samuel Phillips soon proved that he need be 
indebted to no one for his position; that he could 
not only make a place of his own, but could keep it 
also, which was even more important. Soon we 
45 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  46 Some Famous American Schools 
find him a member of the Provincial Congress, then, 
as a manufacturer of gunpowder, coming into inti- 
mate relations with Washington. He sat in the con- 
vention which prepared the first State constitution of 
Massachusetts, was successively judge and State 
senator, and at the time of his death was lieutenant- 
governor of his native Commonwealth. 
A man of his stamp well knew how to value the 
worth of higher education, and even when under 
Master Moody’s care at Byfield the young Samuel 
may have had some dim notion of what he would 
like to accomplish toward extending that education 
to others in future years. Be that as it may, how- 
ever, it was not so many years before he was able 
to carry out a carefully arranged plan for the edu- 
cation of the boys of Andover, for on the twenty- 
first of April, 1778, Phillips Academy at Andover 
was founded. 
The founding was made possible by the gifts of 
the Honourable Samuel Phillips, and his brother, 
the Honourable John Phillips, of one hundred and 
forty-one acres of land in Andover, and some two
-P-A-G-E-59
        Phillips Andover Academy 47 
hundred acres in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, with the 
large sum, for those days, of £1,614. 
Very little time was wasted in getting ready after 
the deed of gift had been drawn up, for on the 
thirtieth of April the school was opened, under the 
care of Eliphalet Pearson, a classmate, at Byfield and 
Harvard, of Samuel Phillips. On the fourth of 
October, 1780, the institution was incorporated as 
Phillips Academy, the earliest chartered academy in 
New England. 
The deed of gift, a document of somewhat for- 
midable length, and commonly styled “The Con- 
stitution of Phillips Academy,” sets forth with 
careful precision the purposes of the givers. Ac- 
cording to this instrument it was proposed “ to lay 
the foundation of a public free SCHOOL or 
ACADEMY for the purpose of instructing Youth, 
not only in English and Latin Grammar, Writing, 
Arithmetic, and those Sciences wherein they are 
commonly taught; but more especially to learn them 
the GREAT END AND REAL BUSINESS OF 
LIVING.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
48 Some Famous American Schools 
Farther on the Phillipses assert that “ the first 
and principal business of this Institution is the pro- 
motion of true PIETY and VIRTUE; the second, 
instruction in the English, Latin, and Greek Lan- 
guages, together with Writing, Arithmetic, Music, 
and the Art of Speaking; the third, practical 
Geometry, Logic, and Geography; and the fourth, 
such other of the liberal Arts and Sciences or Lan- 
guages, as opportunity and ability may hereafter 
admit, and as the TRUSTEES shall direct.” 
Very much in earnest were the Phillipses in re- _ 
gard to the institution they had founded, and in the 
century and a quarter that has elapsed since they 
penned their deed of gift, the academy has abun- 
dantly justified their anticipations and hopes con- 
cerning it. 
Thirteen boys awaited Master Eliphalet Pearson, 
or, as irreverent youngsters came in time to style — 
him, “‘ Elephant Pearson,” on that thirtieth morn- © P 
ing of April, 1778, where in these days over four 
hundred boys assemble. We are assured that the 
first master of the institution was of commanding 
   
-P-A-G-E-61
  Phillips Andover Academy 49 
presence, a decided advantage in the head of a 
school in any century, and that he held his pupils 
well in hand is abundantly certain. 
“. . . Great Eliphalet (I can see him now), — 
Big name, big frame, big voice, and beetling brow.” 
School was school in the days of “ Great Eliph- 
alet”; there was no trifling with frivolous 
matters such as the sciences, history, modern lan- 
guages and the like. Education was felt to be a 
most solid, serious matter, and we find the master 
in 1780 thus assuring the trustees in regard to his 
method. 
“School begins at eight o’clock with devotional 
exercises; a psalm is read and sung. Then a class 
consisting of four scholars repeats memoriter two 
pages in Greek Grammar, after which a class of 
thirty persons repeats a page and a half of Latin 
Grammar; then follows the ‘ Accidence tribe,’ who 
repeat two, three, four, five, and ten pages each. To 
this may be added three who are studying arithmetic; 
one is in the Rule of Three, another in Fellowship, 
and the third in Practice. School is closed at night 
 
-P-A-G-E-62

by reading Dr. Doddridge’s Family Expositor, ac- 
companied by rehearsals, questions, remarks, and 
reflections, and by the singing of a hymn and a 
prayer. On Monday the scholars recite what they 
can remember of the sermons heard on the Lord’s 
Day previous; on Saturday the bills are presented 
and punishments administered.” 
No doubt a forceful person like Master Eliphalet, 
with his commanding presence, found much to do 
on those doleful Saturdays when “ punishments ” 
” were “administered,” and doubtless, too, the “ ser- 
mons heard on the Lord’s Day” were listened to 
with rapt attention if not pleasure, lest some hapless 
slip in the Monday rehearsal should entail the 
Saturday punishment. 
In 1810 the master’s throne was filled by Dr. John 
Adams, who retained possession till 1833, in which 
time some two thousand boys had been under his 
instruction. It is of the building erected some years 
after his coming to Andover that Holmes has writ- 
ten in his poem for the centennial anniversary of the 
academy, “ The Schoolboy ”: 
   
-P-A-G-E-63
  Phillips Andover Academy 51 
“ How all comes back! The upward slanting floor, — 
The masters’ thrones that flank the central door, — 
The long, outstretching alleys that divide 
The rows of desks that stand on either side, — 
The staring boys, a face to every desk, 
Bright, dull, pale, blooming, common, picturesque. 
Grave is the Master’s look; his forehead wears 
Thick rows of wrinkles, prints of worrying cares — 
Supreme he sits ; before the awful frown 
That bends his brows the boldest eye goes down; 
Not more submissive Israel heard and saw 
At Sinai’s foot the Giver of the Law.” 
Perhaps the school relaxed a little the sternness 
of its curriculum in Master Adams’s day, but in 
the earlier years of his rule, at least, such relaxation 
is not markedly apparent. One of the students in 
1814, William Person, assures a friend in a letter 
that students are liable to be called on Monday “ to 
give an abstract of the sermons.” And it will be 
noted that he says sermons, not sermon, for two 
and not infrequently three sermons of goodly length 
formed the Sunday diet of old and young alike 
when the nineteenth century was still in its teens. 
Person goes on to inform his friend that for “ morn-
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 Some Famous American Schools 
ing recitations on Monday we are allotted ten pages 
of Vincent’s explanations of the Westminster As- 
sembly’s Shorter Catechism. This must be com- 
mitted on Sunday or Monday morning, as we have 
no other time. For morning recitations on Sat- 
urday about as many pages of an inestimable tract 
by Mason on Self-knowledge.” 
If young Person’s letter was destined to pass 
beneath the eye of the master we are at no loss to 
understand the characterization of Mason’s immor- 
tal work as “inestimable,” but no doubt his private 
opinion of its merits varied somewhat from his 
written expression of them. 
“For absence, tardiness, and for every detected 
foible our names are entered on the monitor’s bill, 
with the charges respectively annexed, which is 
shown to the Preceptor at the end of the term, and 
we are obliged to give satisfactory reasons for re- 
missness in these particulars, etc. This relation 
will at once convince you that I have but little 
leisure.” 
No, indeed! Leisure was not a thing that Phillips   
 
-P-A-G-E-65
Phillips Andover Academy 53 
Andover boys were expected to know anything about 
from any personal acquaintance with it. Masters 
of the type of Pearson, Adams, and their contem- 
poraries, were earnest, conscientious persons but 
unable to understand that schoolboys differed from 
men except in size. Any such harmonious balance 
of work and relaxation as schools now aim to estab- 
lish would not have been comprehended by them. 
And to say this is only to declare that they were 
not ahead of their age. 
In the years from 1833 to 1837, in which Mr. 
Osgood Johnson was at the head of the acad- 
emy, there was less of sermons and the Assembly’s 
Catechism mingled with the wine of the students’ 
existence than formerly, and more of the classics, 
while under the long régime of Samuel H. Taylor, 
from 1837 to 1871, the institution gradually took 
on much of its present character. The principalship 
of the late Doctor Cecil Bancroft, only so recently 
at an end, is too freshly in the minds of Andover 
men scattered all over the United States to need re- 
calling here. 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
    
54 Some Famous American Schools 
The two Phillips academies of Andover and Ex- 
eter differ very materially in their immediate sur- 
roundings from the other schools described in these 
pages. Both institutions are situated in the midst 
of small towns, while Lawrenceville as completely 
overshadows its tributary hamlet as some medizval 
cathedral dominates the humble village that clusters 
around its base; Saint Paul’s, though within the 
compass of a half-hour’s walk from a small city, 
is yet in a distinctly rural neighbourhood; Groton 
is neighbour only to a few scattered farms; Saint 
Mark’s appears to draw away its exclusive skirts 
from too close contact with the farming village near 
at hand, and Shattuck, though within the small city 
of Faribault, is hardly of it. 
Of the two schools Phillips Exeter is the more 
closely hemmed in by neighbouring buildings and 
estates, and Phillips Andover, though at first sight 
seeming to form an integral part of the town of 
Andover, is presently discovered on wider acquaint- 
ance to be more or less dissociated from it and to be 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  
Phillips Andover Academy 55 
capable of indefinite extension in at least one direc- 
tion. i 
Perhaps one obtains the impression of abundance 
of space more fully at Andover than at any of the 
other institutions we are considering, for all of its 
situation in a fair-sized town. The principal build- 
ings at Shattuck stand in neighbourly proximity, 
and the same may be said of those at Lawrenceville, 
and Groton, while those at Exeter may be said to 
stand almost cheek-by-jowl. Belmont and Saint 
Paul’s resemble it the most nearly in this respect. 
Although the buildings of the last-named institu- 
tion are scattered over a wide territory, yet they 
may be said to be arranged in clusters or groups, the 
members of which are by no means widely severed. 
But Andover, on the contrary, is a school of mag- 
nificent distances, or so the visitor may fancy who 
first beholds it on a winter’s day when a keen blast 
is sweeping over the hill on which the academy 
and its equally famous neighbour, the Theological 
Seminary, are situated. At such times the gym- 
nasium, the dining hall, the new archzeological build- 
 
-P-A-G-E-68

ing, and the recitation hall, will be apt to seem to 
him as widely sundered as the ends of the earth, and 
the athletic house, by the running track, to belong 
to another planet. But Andover youth most proba- 
bly make light of these intervening spaces and skip 
over the icy hilltop fields with all the agility of the 
wild goat upon the mountains. 
Andover, in the opinion of many, at least, repre- 
sents, more nearly than any other of the schools here 
considered, the typical American school spirit, with 
Exeter a close second in this respect. The two 
institutions, it must be acknowledged, are sharply 
differentiated from the others. Lawrenceville and 
Saint Paul’s certainly do not foster anything like the 
democratic spirit dominant at Andover, and to a 
slightly lesser extent, at Exeter, while Groton, at 
least, makes no attempt in that direction. Saint’ 
Paul’s, Saint Mark’s, Groton, and Shattuck, are 
“ church ” schools, and to that extent removed from 
the typical American type, which is not adequately 
represented by any institution definitely under the 
control of any one religious body. Belmont, like

Phillips Andover Academy 59 
Lawrenceville, cannot be pronounced a typical 
school, and Nazareth, as a Moravian institution, 
stands in the same category as the “church” 
schools. 
All this is not to say that the democratic Ameri- 
can ideal is not sought for in the most of these, 
but that from the nature of the case it does not have 
as free play elsewhere as at Andover and Exeter. 
Boys are democratic by nature, and although shades 
of the social prison-house begin very soon, in some 
instances, to close upon the growing boy, he fortu- 
nately retains until his first year in the university a 
good deal of the spirit of indifference to lines of 
social cleavage. This healthy indifference seems, 
if one may judge from present indications, more 
easily preserved at Andover than elsewhere among 
the great preparatory schools. At all of them in 
theory precedence is awarded, among the lads them- 
selves, to character, excellence in athletics, and, to 
some extent, in scholarship, but in practice often- 
times the workings of an opposite theory may be 
detected by close observers. This opposite theory  
-P-A-G-E-72
een ee 60 Some Famous American Schools 
may be acted on to some degree at Andover, but the 
field for its action is there more limited. 
The very newest of Andover’s structures is the 
spacious Archeological Building, formally opened in 
March, 1903, a gift to the academy from an alum- 
nus, representing an expenditure of fifty thousand 
dollars, and its collections, a gift also, are valued at 
nearly as much more. No other great preparatory 
  school in America possesses such an educational 
adjunct, and the course in American archeology 
which the building and its collections make possible 
aids materially in securing the all-round nature of 
instruction which Andover prides itself upon offer-   ing. Its director, Mr. Warren Moorehead, has long 
been known as an authority in this department. 
The collections are exhibited on the main floor; on 
the upper floor are a lecture-room, and a spacious 
and attractive school reading-room; while in the 
basement are rooms for the use of the managers of 
the different athletic organizations, for the use of the 
Camera Club, and for that of the editors of the 
various school papers, so that from its very nature

the structure must necessarily fulfil the hope of its 
giver that it will become a centre of school life. 
It should be added that both interior and exterior 
of this building are well worthy of notice architec- 
turally. 
Almost as new as the Archeological Building, and 
even more impressive from an architectural stand- 
point, is the great Borden Gymnasium, another gift 
to the Academy, and perhaps more generally appre- 
ciated than the one just described. It presents a 
most dignified exterior, and all the comforts, and 
even the majority of the luxuries demanded by the 
modern athlete are contained within it, with one 
important exception, a swimming-pool. As _ that 
adjunct, however, is contemplated in a structure at 
a lower level to be erected ere long in connection 
with the gymnasium, its absence need not therefore 
be remarked. From the rear windows of the gym- 
nasium one obtains a good view of the Brothers’ 
Field, likewise a gift to the academy, constituting 
the athletic ground of the institution. It comprises 
two football and two baseball fields in the most 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
      
  64 Some Famous American Schools 
   excellent condition, thanks to the labours of the | 
Athletic Association. The grounds around the gym- 
  nasium have been laid out under the direction of the 
most competent American landscape architects, and 
their beneficent operations will in time be extended | 
over other portions of the academy property. 
In certain respects the dining-hall will prove to 
many persons, as it did to the writer, the most 
interesting of the many buildings connected with the 
institution. It is the old brick academy, to which 
Doctor Holmes refers in his poem, “The School- 
boy,” already quoted from, and for whose excellent 
proportions the famous American architect Bulfinch 
was originally responsible. It was for a long period 
occupied as a gymnasium, but having been partially 
destroyed by fire was very lately remodelled, and 
rebuilt, and an extension added in the rear. The 
lower floor is now occupied as a dining-hall, and 
the upper one can very readily be put to the same 
use. Two rows of white columns extend lengthwise 
through the spacious, high-ceilinged apartment, 
which, with its small tables and chairs of black oak,

  Phillips Andover Academy 67 
forms, with the white walls and many columns, one 
of the most cheerful, altractive dining-halls it is 
possible to conceive of. The hall is managed by a 
committee made up of the academy treasurer, a 
member of the faculty, and three of the students, 
the general oversight being left almost entirely to 
the students on the committee. As a factor in the 
promotion of proper school spirit the dining-hall has 
proved of great value and the arrangement of small 
tables, each seating four persons, does much to foster 
social feeling. One cannot imagine anything like 
the same social spirit being aroused at the long 
tables in the dining-hall at the Groton Hundred 
House. 
Had either Andover or Exeter desired to carry 
out the loco parentis principle preferred at Saint 
Paul’s, one important obstacle would have blocked 
the way, as it has to a very considerable extent inter- 
fered with school discipline in the past — the sys- 
tem of placing boys in private houses for their board 
and lodging. This custom originated in the days 
of simpler living, when academies were unprovided
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 Some Famous American Schools 
with facilities for boarding and lodging more than 
a very few pupils, and the majority were therefore 
boarded in private families. In theory the boy was 
merely transferred from the home of his parents to 
another home in the academy town, and in very 
many cases he did so find another home. But as 
academies increased in size the commercial aspect 
of providing food and accommodations for the stu- 
dents came more and more into prominence, and the 
more unscrupulous of lodging-house keepers, desir- 
ous of retaining their lodgers, sometimes connived 
with the students under their charge in attempts to 
set school discipline and regulations at nought. 
Both at Andover and Exeter the evils of the 
lodging-house system have proved so burdensome 
that in recent years dormitories have been erected at 
each institution, and at Andover fully one-half of 
the pupils are thus housed, and as time goes on a 
still greater proportion will be so lodged, as addi- 
tional structures for this purpose are already con- 
templated by the academy. Of course such a radical 
departure from the old system met with much oppo- 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  BANCROFT COTTAGE, PHILLIPS, ANDOVER.
-P-A-G-E-82

-P-A-G-E-83
  Phillips Andover Academy 71 
sition from persons in the towns whose living de- 
pended upon sums received from their lodgers, and 
this was especially the case in Andover, but as the 
academy was not supposed to exist merely as a 
source of revenue to Andover townspeople, the 
school authorities have resolutely persevered in their 
efforts to establish the dormitory system. 
The dormitory plan is, therefore, a new feature at 
Andover, and the buildings in which it is carried 
out are very new and, if not beautiful, at least sub- 
stantial. The largest of them is the Bancroft, a 
severely plain modern rendering of the simple type 
exhibited at Harvard University in ancient Hol- 
worthy Hall, so far as its exterior is concerned, 
albeit with three entrances instead of two. As a 
protest against the ornate style for which the sixties 
and seventies were responsible, and which is shown 
forth in the two recitation-halls at Andover and 
Exeter, the severity has its value, but architectural 
asceticism of the Trappist variety might have been 
avoided. However, once the Bancroft is entered, 
the students’ apartments are found to be as attractive
-P-A-G-E-84
72 Some Famous American Schools 
as one could desire, and there appears to be no 
evidence that the objections prevalent at Shattuck 
to “draperies and other hangings” as “ littering 
up” the rooms, are shared by the Andover authori- 
ties. 
The writer cannot help the feeling that much is 
gained in arousing a spirit of decorum, at least, if 
not of reverence, by devoting a school chapel 
strictly to devotional purposes. Lawrenceville, 
Saint Mark’s, Saint Paul’s, Shattuck, and Groton 
certainly secure, in the existence of their separate 
chapels sacred to religious uses, something of impor- 
tance that is lacking where the chapel has no archi- 
tectural significance and is merely an apartment 
employed for secular purposes as well. Belmont, we 
believe, contemplates the erection of a school chapel 
in the future, and it is greatly to be hoped that 
Exeter will do the same. At Andover until the 
present year (1903) the morning chapel exercises 
have been held in the large assembly-hall of the 
main academy building, but pending repairs to this

structure they have been held in the large stone 
chapel belonging to the Theological Seminary. 
The loyalty of Andover men to their academy has 
been shown in many ways in recent years. In addi- 
tion to the gymnasium and the Archzological 
Building, already named as gifts to the institution 
from alumni, the Bancroft, Taylor, and Eaton Cot- 
tages, erected for dormitory purposes, are gifts from 
a similar source, nor do these complete the tale of the 
generosity of Andover graduates, while the class of 
1892 are already moving in the matter of securing a 
much needed infirmary for the school use. 
The prevailing building material is red brick, and 
generally of a hue that deepens and grows richer 
with time. The administration office, the great sci- 
ence building, built in 1891, the recitation-hall, now 
(May, 1903) undergoing extensive reconstruction, 
as well as other structures are all of this material, 
and the effect of such masses of warm colour either 
in the midst of expanses of snow and seen through 
bare, ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang, 
or rising from out green turf and with outlines half
-P-A-G-E-88
  76 Some Famous American Schools 
obscured by foliage, is equally grateful to the eye. 
The colour varies in depth somewhat, but no such 
discordant note has been struck in this respect as 
may be noted at Harvard in the presence of the 
pale sandstone of the Fogg Museum in the midst 
of the red brick structures of the college yard. 
Even to the casual visitor and observer, Andover 
would appear to be upon the threshold of, if not 
precisely a great change, at least of a great extension 
of influence. The adoption of the dormitory sys- 
tem, the opening of the new dining-hall, both mean 
the rapid spread of social student life, the develop- 
ment of a more decided attachment to the school on 
the part of its pupils. The immense gymnasium 
makes possible a degree of physical culture not be- 
fore attainable, and to this end the new athletic 
fields and the extensive golf links contribute. The 
scientific department adds to its capabilities with 
each year; the new archeological department 
renders Andover unique in this respect at present; 
while no undue spirit of conservatism prevails re- 
garding the adoption of new methods and customs 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
        
    
       
      
  Phillips Andover Academy 77 
in the system of general management, if they appear 
likely to work for the good of the institution. 
The plant of the school, to adopt the unpleasing 
but comprehensive phrase of the moment, is already 
so extensive as to experience the absolute necessity 
of spreading still further. The impetus of rapid 
growth has been acquired, and with such growth will 
come the greater efficiency induced by quickened 
enthusiasm and fuller opportunities. 
And both Andover and Exeter desire to grow, 
and in this they differ once more from several of 
    the schools here discussed. Saint Mark’s and Groton 
    are quite satisfied with their present numbers, one 
hundred and twenty-five in the one case, and one 
    hundred and fifty in the other. Nazareth is probably 
    not seeking any great augmentation of its numbers, 
    and Belmont and Shattuck are looking, we may 
    suppose, for only a moderate increase. Lawrence- 
    ville and Saint Paul’s, though they may go on 
    increasing their efficiency by the erection of new 
    buildings from time to time, have nearly reached the 
    limit they have set for themselves; at least this is   
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 Some Famous American Schools 
true in the case of the former school, and if Saint 
Paul’s is to increase very much in size its theory 
of government must necessarily undergo serious 
modifications. 
But, as was just said, Andover and Exeter desire 
to increase, and there is no good reason why they 
should not do so. And of the two schools, Andover, 
from its capabilities as to space, is possibly more 
likely than its sister academy to expand and develop 
new spheres of influence. 
There is no need here to dilate upon the attract- 
iveness of the old Massachusetts town, venerable 
with its two hundred and fifty years of continued 
existence. But in the future even more than in the 
past, the academy is destined to become its distinct- 
ive, secular feature, and should the seminary which 
has made the name of Andover theology so famous 
ever be removed, as has more than once been sug- 
gested, the Phillips Academy will then stand for 
Andover in the minds of most persons who may 
recall but vaguely the fact that Andover had once 
a literary atmosphere all its own, when the affairs

of the academy boys were not uppermost in the 
public mind if Andover was mentioned, nor their 
doings heralded in the sporting columns of the news- 
papers. 
Andover has changed marvellously in many 
things from the time when the pupils of the “ great 
Eliphalet ” closed the “ duties of each day” (they 
seldom spoke then of the pleasures of the day, but 
only of its duties) by reading at night from the 
good Doctor Doddridge’s “ Family Expositor,” and 
Sunday sermons are not now harkened to to the 
end ‘that they shall furnish a theme for Monday 
catechizing. They have changed all that at Andover, 
as Andover theology has suffered an equally 
remarkable transformation, but what has not been 
altered at the school is the steady purpose to excel, 
to get the best that life offers, that the founder 
hoped to inspire in the youth of his day, as apparent, 
now, in the study-hall, if signs do not deceive, as 
on the athletic field. If indeed Andover boys have 
not yet fully learned the “Great End and Real 
Business of Living” when they go forth from out

these red brick walls on Andover Hill, they have 
nevertheless made real and definite approaches 
toward that desired end, and the way thereafter has 
at least been made plain to their youthful feet.

HE founding of Exeter Academy followed 
oe hard upon that of the sister institution at 
Andover. When the success of the latter 
seemed to be assured, or, at least, when the school 
had withstood the practical test of a three years’ 
trial, Phillips Exeter Academy was incorporated on 
the third of April, 1781. Its purpose, in substance, 
as set forth in its charter, differed slightly, if at all, 
from that of the school at Andover, aiming at “ pro- 
moting Piety and Virtue, and for the education of 
youth in the English, Latin, and Greek languages, 
in Writing, Arithmetic, Music, and the Art of 
Speaking, Practical Geometry, Logic, and Geogra- 
phy, and such other of the Liberal Arts and Sciences 
or Languages as opportunity may hereinafter per- 
mit.” 
A charter having been obtained, Doctor John

-P-A-G-E-98
   
   86 Some Famous American Schools 
Phillips, of Exeter, on the ninth day of January, 
1782, conveyed formally to the academy trustees 
all his interest in many tracts of land in various 
New Hampshire townships. His deed of gift was 
styled a Constitution, like that of the deed to 
Andover, and included a series of regulations which 
he directed to be read at each and every annual 
meeting of the trustees. Good, common-sense regu- 
lations they were, and Doctor John did not mean 
that they should ever fall into what in these days is 
“innocuous desuetude.” sometimes characterized as 
In the earlier part of his career, when fresh from 
Harvard College, John Phillips had preached for 
a time, and then, after listening to the impassioned 
discourses of Whitefield, felt himself to be unfit for 
the sacred calling upon which he had entered, and 
relinquished it. For a little he was a master in a 
classical school, then went into business, and in 
later life was a justice in a New Hampshire court. 
The total value of his gifts to the academy of his 
founding was about $65,000. 
The Phillips family have not been without hon- 
 
-P-A-G-E-99

our in their descendants: Josiah Quincy, president 
of Harvard College, was connected with it on the 
maternal side; Wendell Phillips was descended 
from a cousin of the founders of Andover and 
Exeter Academies; and Bishop Phillips Brooks was 
a great-grandson of Judge Samuel Phillips. 
On the first of May, 1783, the academy was cere- 
moniously opened under the charge of Master Will- 
iam Woodbridge, who, at the end of five years, 
resigned on account of ill health, to be immediately. 
succeeded by Benjamin Abbot, who continued at the 
head of the school for a full half-century. Daniel 
Webster came to him at fourteen, Edward Everett 
at thirteen, Lewis Cass at ten, and many another boy 
famous in after life came under his influence. 
Doctor Abbot had been at Andover Academy 
under Master Pearson, and went immediately to 
Exeter after his graduation from Harvard in 1788, 
receiving a yearly salary at first of “‘ one hundred and 
thirty-three pounds, six shillings, and eight pence, 
, lawful money,” increased in 1799 to seven hundred 
dollars, with the use of a dwelling-house. He is 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 Some Famous American Schools 
reported to have been tall and graceful, with not 
a little sweetness softening the dignity of his ex- 
pression. Was he a believer in corporal punish- 
ments? Most certainly; what schoolmaster was not, 
a century ago? And his punishments were no light 
afflictions of the moment, either, but substantial, 
thorough-going affairs, admirably well calculated 
to impress youth with a sense of their reality. The 
sternness of his manner disappeared, it is true, when 
the punishment was over, but the uncomfortable 
period immediately preceding its disappearance was 
not readily forgotten. 
His pupils retained the most affectionate remem- 
brance of him in after life, however, and the Abbot 
Scholarship at Harvard University commemorates 
both the master and their thought of him. 
Doctor Abbot was succeeded in 1838 by Principal 
Soule, who had already taught for seventeen years 
in the academy, and the fiftieth year of his continu- 
ous service was celebrated in 1872. In June, 1883, 
the institution observed its centennial anniversary, 
an event Quite within what may be called modern
-P-A-G-E-101
Phillips Exeter Academy 89 
times, when the history of a school is being consid- 
ered, and very naturally, on that occasion, mention 
was made, more or less detailed, of the academical 
roll of honour. 
It is too long for full recital here, but it may be 
said that on the list of the alumni, up to that period, 
there had been seven Cabinet ministers, twelve gov- 
ernors of States, four justices of the National 
Supreme Court, nine college presidents, fifty-two 
college professors, four eminent historians, three 
major-generals, and two rear-admirals. 
It is harder to differentiate Exeter from Andover 
than from any other of the great schools of its 
class, and yet from Andover it differs in certain 
respects discoverable after extended acquaintance 
with both. The Exeter graduate would probably 
instance with most enthusiasm the fact that at Exe- 
ter boys are placed on their honour from the time 
of entrance till that of leaving. In all schools this 
principle has more or less extended application, but 
at Exeter it appears to find completest exemplifica- 
tion both as regards work and conduct.» Presum- 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
rrr ee mee ee cee ere ree 
go Some Famous American Schools 
ably the system wotlis well in this case, or it would 
not be followed from one year to another. It is 
in accordance with its workings, therefore, that at 
Exeter the visitor discovers no common study-hall, 
as at other institutions, for the use of the school in 
whole or in part. Even the youngest Exeter lads 
prepare their lessons in their own rooms, whether 
these are situated in the school dormitories or in 
private houses approved by the school authorities. 
From the foundation of the school in 1781 the 
honour system has been characteristic of its life, and 
in the view of many this interprets the strong hold 
on the affection of its graduates which the school 
  undeniably possesses. The very entrance to it has 
proved in many cases the beginning of the senti- 
ment of mingled confidence and respect existing 
between the taught and their teachers. 
The Exeter student will be found on the whole 
rather more mature than are the pupils at many 
other schools, the average age being from seventeen 
to eighteen. In this year of 1903 the extremes 
are twelve and twenty-five, and as it chances the

boy of twelve and the young man of twenty-five are 
in the same class, the one having had unusual advan- 
tages prior to entrance, the other almost none. The 
two classmates are also chums, for close friendships 
between boys in the same class but differing much 
in age are by no means unusual occurrences at 
Exeter. 
“Disce aut discede.” So runs the motto on the 
wall of the building known as “ School,” at Win- 
chester College, England, a legend which perhaps 
in these days would be heroically rendered “ Work 
or Walk.” More or less consciously this appears to 
be the motto at Exeter, where self-reliance and 
independence are especially characteristic features 
to be noted. The school has never adopted the 
loco parentis theory, save to the limited extent really 
necessary, and in giving large freedom gradually to 
its students ere the university is reached, it has 
hoped to prepare them for the still more independent 
life there. Lawrenceville, as will be seen, in its 
treatment of its upper forms, has acted upon the 
same principle.  
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 Some Famous American Schools 
In those early days of Exeter’s history, when no 
tuition was charged, self-government was a domi- 
nant principle, as it is now. Perhaps the circum- 
stance that no one especial class, socially speaking, 
has been represented here is largely responsible for 
its existence. Representatives of distinguished 
families have studied here, as have members of 
humble ones, and wealth or social distinction has 
counted for very little in popular school estimates. 
That they have not counted at all, it would probably 
be too much to assert, for boys are not wholly dis- 
tinct from their elders in this respect, but the insti- 
tution has been essentially and healthily democratic, 
and therefore, in the minds of some persons, the 
more “ American.” As a matter of fact, however, 
democracy finds much fuller play in the English 
school than many Americans imagine, and often 
rather more than in some American ones. 
Democracy of the right kind is a very desirable 
attribute of any institution, and it seems to have been 
generally recognized at any rate as characteristic 
of Exeter, and the late Sherman Hoar is said to 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
    Phillips Exeter Academy 93 
have declared that he never realized what democracy 
in its best sense meant, or the rights and claims of 
other boys, until after his experiences as an under- 
graduate at Phillips Exeter, and that whatever 
ability he had in perceiving the innate worth of 
other men he owed to his life here. Surely when 
lessons of this character have been taken to heart the 
school where they have been conned has certainly 
made great advance in its purpose of teaching its 
pupils what the Phillipian phraseology styles no 
less accurately than quaintly, “the great end and 
real business of living.” 
The founder’s constitution is in no danger of 
being forgotten in the school whose existence is due 
to his munificence, for on a bronze tablet which a 
graduating class has given to it this sentence stands 
prominently forth: “It shall ever be equally open 
to youth of requisite qualifications from every 
quarter.” 
Whether the benevolent Doctor John ever con- 
templated the coming of a time when youth of 
colour should knock for admission at the doors of 
    
-P-A-G-E-106
    
    94 Some Famous American Schools 
his academy is doubtful, to say the least of it, but 
if he had done so it is fairly probable from the 
temper of his time in such regards, that this con- 
tingency would have made no difference in his 
expressed desires. At all events the clause just 
quoted renders it impossible for the authorities to 
draw the colour-line in the matter of admission to 
the school, even did they wish to do so, which in 
view of the prevailing democratic spirit is at least 
unlikely. 
  Coloured youth there are, therefore, at Exeter, 
and no serious trouble has ever arisen from this 
circumstance. They have been manly, self-respect- 
ing fellows, attending strictly to business, as one 
may say, and showing little or no desire to push 
themselves forward. A notable example in this 
particular was the son of the late coloured Senator 
from Mississippi, the Honourable B. K. Bruce. 
Young Bruce, who was chosen orator of his class 
at Harvard University, in 1902, and whose univer- 
sity record was a brilliant one, prepared for the 
university at Exeter, and during his stay at the
-P-A-G-E-107
        Phillips Exeter Academy 95 
academy took active part in the various interests 
of the school, but never pushed himself to the front. 
In addition to great natural ability he possessed the 
instincts of the true gentleman, and it was the gen- 
eral observation both at Exeter and Harvard, that 
he never sought the society of the other men, but 
that they sought him. His case may be instanced 
as that of one entering Exeter under a serious 
handicap, but nevertheless winning his way to the 
front rank under the existing favourable conditions 
by sheer force of ability and character. 
At almost any preparatory school some one col- 
lege in particular seems to be the goal of a large 
number, if not of a majority of its undergraduates. 
At Lawrenceville the goal is Princeton, as is perhaps 
natural from its situation; at Groton, Exeter, and 
Saint Paul’s, it is Harvard; at Andover it is Yale; 
at Shattuck it appears to have been Trinity at first, 
but in later years the University of Michigan; while 
at Belmont the university haven of nearly one-half 
has been the University of California, with Leland 
Stanford Junior University and Harvard, next in 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
      
    96 Some Famous American Schools 
favour. Causes for the preference are not always 
apparent on the surface. Juxtaposition naturally 
counts for much, as in the cases of Lawrenceville 
and Princeton; Belmont and the University of Cali- 
fornia; but precisely why at Andover “ the stream 
of tendency” should be toward Yale, while that 
at Exeter should be toward Harvard, is not so easy 
to discover. In the days when Andover theology 
and Yale College were equally and uncompromis- 
ingly orthodox, while Harvard College was pre- 
sumed to be as uncompromisingly unorthodox, a 
preference for Yale over Harvard manifested at 
Andover may have been explainable, but the ortho- 
doxy at Exeter being not perceptibly milder than 
that at the sister academy, the choice in this case 
is plainly not referable to any such considerations. 
Although distinctively a New England institu- 
tion, the patronage of Exeter is certainly national, 
thirty-five States and the District of Columbia being 
represented in the list of students of 1903, as well 
as one from Nova Scotia and one from distant New 
Zealand, though why one should come from the
-P-A-G-E-109
  Phillips Exeter Academy 97 
Antipodes to slake his thirst for knowledge at the 
Pierian springs of New Hampshire is something 
of a mystery, unless accounted for by the presump- 
tion of missionary labours performed in behalf of 
the academy by some enthusiastic alumnus in that 
particular portion of the dominions of his Majesty 
King Edward, of that name the Seventh. 
A feature of school life formerly more common 
than now, but in which a revival of interest has 
taken place in recent years, is the training in debate. 
At Saint Paul’s this has always been encouraged, 
but at Exeter it has always been prominent. To 
stimulate this interest still further a fund of three 
thousand dollars was established by Doctor Abner 
Merrill in 1896 for prizes in the English department, 
or, in the words of the giver, “ to encourage earnest 
and intelligent attention to the art of writing Eng- 
lish, and the art of public speaking.” By the terms 
of gift the principal remains intact, the yearly 
income, one hundred and fifty dollars, being 
equally divided between the composition and dec- 
lamation contests. 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 Some Famous American Schools 
The earliest of the two Exeter debating societies, 
the Golden Branch, was founded in 1818, and the 
younger, the G. L. Soule Debating Society, in 1881. 
Each has its library and society room, in which 
meetings are held on alternate Saturday evenings 
and various knotty as well as weighty questions of 
national and universal import oratorically ‘settled 
for all time by these enthusiastic Exonians. Each 
society numbers about thirty members who not 
only contest with each other, but hold combined 
contests with other institutions. For three years 
past the academy societies have held debates most 
vigorously contested, one may well believe, with 
the classes in Harvard University, winning one 
each against the Harvard freshman and sophomore 
debaters. Ordinary printer’s ink is far too pale to 
record fitly the celebrations of effervescent Exonians 
on the receipt of the news of these respective vic- 
tories. 
Of yet greater prominence than declamation in 
the ordinary existence of the Exonian, youthful 
nature being what it always has been, is athletics,

for even the most phlegmatic boy enjoys beholding 
the athletic diversions of others though disinclined 
to such exertion for himself. The athletic temple 
at Exeter does not stand forth to view so promi- 
nently as at some other schools, for at the period of 
its erection, some twenty years ago, the gymnasium 
did not hold relatively so high a place as now in the 
estimation of school authorities, whatever may have 
been the case with the schoolboys of that remote era. 
The Exeter gymnasium, therefore, occupies almost 
an apologetic site in the rear of the academy itself, 
typical, it may be, of the earlier conception of its 
relations to that respected department of the insti- 
tution as a whole. 
It is of goodly size, one hundred feet by sixty, 
providing for the most if not all of the requirements 
the young athlete is accustomed to make. Dressing- 
rooms with lockers, boxing-room, baths, ball prac- 
tice room — all these are found in the basement, 
while in the great hall above what may be called 
the main business is carried on, the running-track 
with twenty-four laps to the mile sweetening the
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 Some Famous American Schools 
hardships of scholastic existence for some persons, 
while on the main floor large casts of “ The Wres- 
tlers” and “ A Boxer Resting,” form as appropriate 
as they are novel adornments for such an apart- 
ment. 
The visitor to the gymnasium is very sure to have 
pointed out to him for notice what is known as the 
Faculty Shield, a prize established by the Faculty 
in 1897 to promote a proper class rivalry, as well 
as an improvement in track athletics, the fact of 
the gift being thus made testifying strongly, if any 
such testimony were needful, as to the position of 
that body regarding the place of athletics in Exonian 
economy. Upon the class winning the greatest 
number of points, the points in question being 
awarded on a basis of competition afforded by ath- 
letic conquests, gymnasium decoration, and class 
attendance, is conferred the honour of having its 
numerals engraved on the shield. Since 1897 the 
two hundred and twenty yard board track has seen 
an annual contest on Washington’s birthday, while 
that illustrious patriot has been still further hon-
-P-A-G-E-115
Phillips Exeter Academy 103 
oured from an Exonian point of view, by a series of 
indoor events celebrated in the gymnasium on that 
same national holiday. 
Important as track athletics are, they are over- 
shadowed to a considerable extent by the baseball 
and football interests, and many and fierce have been 
the contests in both sports with Andover, in 
especial, as well as with other institutions. It is a 
matter of history that when in 1900 the Exeter 
football eleven won a victory of ten to nothing over 
the eleven of the sister institution, the church bells 
of Exeter pealed joyously forth — 
“ As ’twere some king returning from his wars,” 
and brass bands and bonfires but inadequately ex- 
pressed the feelings of Exonians, both town and 
gown. Everybody praised everybody else, students 
and faculty fell, metaphorically speaking, on each 
others’ necks, and a New England rendering of a 
Roman triumph was accorded the victorious eleven. 
History becomes nebulous regarding the observ- 
ances at Andover on the same occasion, but pre- 
sumably the heavens were hung with black, bells 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  104 Some Famous American Schools 
were rung backward, and the mourners went about 
the streets. 
It cannot be said with entire truth that the build- 
ings at Exeter are beautiful, but they appear sub- 
stantial and eminently serviceable, and utilitarians 
would have us believe that the beautiful is not to 
be named in the same day as the useful. And with 
occasional exceptions it cannot be so named — at 
Exeter, so far as exteriors are concerned. 
And still it is evident that when the present 
academy building was erected it was fondly imag- 
ined to be beautiful. It is of red brick of a good 
_ Tich colour, but it was built in 1871, and what beau- 
tiful structure could possibly have been reared at 
that time in America, the very middle of the archi- 
tectural dark ages in these United States? The first 
academy served the needs of the school for eleven 
years, a new one being built in 1794. This was 
enlarged in 1821, but destroyed by fire in 1870. 
Its successor of 1871 stands very near its site. 
But whatever opinions may be entertained of the 
academy exterior, there can be but one of its internal

adornments. Here, indeed, a distinctive feature of 
Exeter makes itself at once apparent. One might 
easily imagine oneself in a department of some 
museum of fine arts, for turn where one may, busts 
and plaster casts meet the eye in every direction, 
engravings and photographs of rare excellence cover 
the walls. Ais one wanders from room to room it 
becomes evident that no haphazard principle of 
selection has been exercised here, but the most 
restrained, discriminating taste instead. The work 
has not been overdone, but the happy medium be- 
tween enough and too much has been precisely 
struck. In the classical rooms will be seen the busts 
of Greek philosophers and Roman emperors; cathe- 
dral photographs, carbon prints, engravings, etc., 
will be discovered in the English and other class- 
rooms, while the long corridors display fine plaster 
casts and statuary. 
All these treasures have been the recent gifts of 
loyal alumni, but their presence here is due to the 
initiative efforts of one alumnus, William Edward 
Merrill, Esquire, who by his own enthusiasm 
   
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 Some Famous American Schools 
aroused the interest of alumni regarding the interior 
adornment of the academy, and as a result of in- 
numerable visits paid by him to Exonians in vari- 
ous places, secured promises to contribute for this 
end, promises which have been redeemed, as one 
sees, in most liberal fashion. Nor does the tale 
of his efforts end at this point, for as a result of 
his personal solicitations important bequests of rare 
books and engravings, and literary bric-d-brac have 
been pledged to the academy. In one case an entire 
library of this exceptional character has been prom- 
ised to the institution through the efforts of this 
same alumnus. 
In the early days of Phillips Exeter, its pupils 
were lodged, as were those of Phillips Andover, 
in the houses of the townspeople, and not 
until nearly a century and a quarter had elapsed 
were certain timid, tentative steps taken by the 
trustees toward the adoption of the dormitory sys- 
tem. A building which had formerly been occupied 
as a printing establishment was then fitted up as a 
dormitory with semi-Spartan accommodations, and

-P-A-G-E-122

-P-A-G-E-123
  Phillips Exeter Academy III 
this proving a success, Abbot Hall was erected in 
1855, the trustees being now assured that it was 
no longer advisable to have all the students received 
into the houses of the townspeople as members of 
their families. In this matter Exeter considerably 
preceded Andover. 
Seventeen years later the Squamscott House, with- 
out the limits of the academy grounds, was pur- 
chased, renamed Gorham Hall, and occupied as a 
dormitory until 1889, when it was sold and Soule 
Hall erected in its stead, in the academy yard, in 
1893. The academy catalogue, which describes this 
later structure as ‘ “severely plain,” is certainly in 
the right of it. Equally austere in appearance is 
Peabody Hall, erected in 1896, and Hoyt Hall, a 
neighbouring dormitory, built in 1903, makes the 
third of a group of buildings as rigidly free from 
anything approaching architectural effect as can 
well be imagined. As examples of careful, scien- 
tific construction and ingenious interior design they 
are admirable, but one cannot honestly say more in 
their praise. They might perhaps serve as whole-
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 Some Famous American Schools 
some examples of restraint in art were there any- 
where evidences that their designer was under the 
necessity of exercising “architectural restraint.” 
Far more pleasing in every way is Dunbar Hall, 
added to the dormitory system in 1894 as Lawrence 
House, but enlarged and entirely remodelled in 1901. 
Here, and here only, Exeter makes an approach 
to the house system which we shall discover in its 
most complete development at Lawrenceville, and 
it may be that in this particular there is a following 
out to some extent at Exeter of the model furnished 
at Winchester, England. The hall stands on the op- 
posite side of the elm-shaded street that divides the 
academy grounds, and has a spacious green before 
it. It is of wood, the older portion counting more 
than its century of existence; the newer happily 
adapted to it in general exterior appearance. Here 
are lodged some thirty boys of the junior and lower 
middle classes, under the care of a master and his 
wife, and of an assistant master in addition. The 
boys’ rooms are on the second and third floors, while 
on the lower one are a large dining-hall, the recep-

tion-room and private apartments of the master, an 
apartment for games and recreations, and a most 
ogee attractive students’ ‘common room.” Even here, 
however, there is the same liberty as to study as 
elsewhere at the academy, and the pupils are per- 
mitted to study in their own rooms. 
To the left of the academy stands the building in 
which, regarded architecturally, Exeter men will in 
future take the most pride, for it forms the principal 
exception to the absence of noteworthy architecture 
at the school, and in which for still another reason 
they will have cause to feel a pride also. This is 
the Alumni Hall, built by the contributions of Exe- 
ter alumni, and completed in June, 1903. It is of 
brick, one hundred feet by forty-four, and is to serve 
as a dining-hall for three hundred students. The 
huge windows which light it will one day, without 
much doubt, be filled with stained glass contributed 
by successive graduating classes, and portraits will 
line the walls, as at the Memorial Hall at Harvard. 
At the time of the writer’s visit a dense forest of 
scaffolding materially interfered with the general 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  116 Some Famous American Schools 
view of the interior, but its lofty height and fine 
proportions were manifest in spite of these obstruc- 
tions. Its existence furnishes additional proof of 
the intense loyalty to his school which characterizes 
the Exonian. 
Another instance of it is shown in Merrill Hall, 
a three-story structure of brick given to the academy 
in January, 1903, by Doctor Abner Merrill, an 
alumnus of 1838, and the giver, some years earlier, 
of the Merrill Prizes already mentioned. Its lower 
floor accommodates the administrative offices of 
the school; on the second are the rooms of the two 
debating societies; and on the third a pool and 
billiard room at one end, and at the other a reading- 
room where students may smoke if they choose. 
This apartment, with its memorial fireplace given by 
the class of 1902, its easy chairs, books and peri- 
odicals, makes as pleasant a lounging-place for 
students as can well be imagined. Timid mothers 
and conservative pedagogues may shudder at the 
notion of tobacco and billiards being thus publicly 
countenanced by the faculty of a school, but the en- 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
        Phillips Exeter Academy 117 
trance to the broad path that leadeth to destruction is 
not from these cheerful, well-ordered rooms in Mer- 
rill Hall, nevertheless. 
The other buildings at Exeter are the chem- 
ical and physical laboratories, of the ascetic arch- 
itectural type which seems to be accepted as the cor- 
rect thing in such buildings, and the Athletic House, 
situated in the seven-acre athletic field on Linden 
Street, a one-story structure furnished with all the 
modern conveniences such an educational adjunct 
is expected to contain. 
It will be noted that this tale of Exeter buildings 
makes no mention of either a, library or a chapel. 
The institution has a library, it is true, but no build- 
ing devoted solely to its use, and the want of one 
is severely felt. If Exeter’s future copy fair its 
past we may look to see an alumnus appear some 
day, Carnegie-wise, with a library building in his 
hand which the academy may have for the taking. 
A chapel building, however, is less likely to be 
numbered among the academy structures in the near 
future, for the reason that the plan of the institution 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 Some Famous American Schools 
does not contemplate such frequent use of a chapel 
as does that of several other schools here described. 
On Sundays the students are obliged to attend 
service at whichever of the seven Protestant and 
Roman Catholic churches in the town are indicated 
by the parents in each case, but the academy, as 
such, makes no provision for public worship. On 
week-days there are daily devotional exercises in 
the large hall, termed the chapel, in the academy 
building. This is a spacious, lofty-ceilinged apart- 
ment, its walls hung with portraits of notables con- 
nected at one time or another with the school, but 
possessing much greater interest as a portrait-gallery 
than for any other reason. It is a handsome hall 
for secular purposes, but wholly unimpressive as 
a chapel. 
A recent feature of Shattuck School, elsewhere 
noted, will shortly be made a detail of the Exeter 
institution, likewise: a preparatory school for the 
academy, based on the model furnished for such 
schools in England. This will make it possible for 
yery young boys to be prepared for the discipline 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  
 
-P-A-G-E-132

-P-A-G-E-133

they will find awaiting them in the academy itself 
when they reach it. Whether it is wise to send 
boys froma home at so early an age as are those for 
whom the Shattuck School for Little Boys, and the 
forthcoming Exeter small boys’ school are intended, 
is another matter, which need not be threshed out 
here, but regarding which divergent views are likely 
to find expression. 
It is unlikely that Exeter will remain content with 
~ its list of three hundred pupils. It is frankly hope- 
ful for increased numbers in the future, and in 
the nature of things there appears no. good reason 
why, under its present energetic management, and 
with its steadily growing facilities for its work, it 
should not experience a very material increase. 
The timidity of half a century ago, evinced in its 
slow adoption of the dormitory system, has long 
since given place to a progressive spirit which ac- 
cepts nothing as necessarily final in educational 
work, but is yet as many degrees removed from un- 
considered change as from moss-grown conserva- 
tism. A long and honourable past entitles her to  
-P-A-G-E-134
  122 Some Famous American Schools 
the respectful regard which such a background 
necessarily inspires, and creates a well-founded con- 
fidence in her future. Her face is set westward and 
one can ask for her no better gift from destiny than 
that it should — 
“ Give her the glory of going on and still to be.”

Lawrenceville School 
N the midst of the floor-like countryside which 
l stretches northeastward from Trenton, New 
Jersey, is the hamlet of Lawrenceville, five 
miles from the State capital. Originally known as 
Maidenhead, after the English locality of that name, 
it became Lawrenceville in 1815 in honour of Cap- 
tain Lawrence, the famous American naval hero. 
This burst of patriotism was protested against in 
town meeting, but the enthusiasts had their way. 
The territory was traversed by an Indian trail from 
the Raritan to the falls of the Delaware, a trail 
which later became the “ King’s Highway,” but since 
such an appellation could not be suffered to shock 
patriotic echoes after kings had ceased to have any 
part and title in the American colonies, the high- 
way was thenceforward known as “ The Great 
Road.” In our own prosaic days it is not infre- 
125 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 Some Famous American Schools 
quently styled the “pike,” a word very dear to 
Jerseymen. 
The hamlet is cut in two by the highway as com- 
pletely as the earth appears on the map to be divided 
by the equator. On the left hand, as one goes 
northward from Trenton, are several of the lesser 
structures pertaining to the school which has given 
the village such wide fame, the post-office, and 
several dwellings of the villagers, on the right: 
“A garden here, May breath and bloom of spring.” 
At least so it impressed the writer on the occasion 
of his first visit to Lawrenceville. Acres of the 
softest green turf stretch away from the road on 
this side, and the careful disposition of shade and 
ornamental trees and shrubbery, of walks and drives, 
and of the buildings dotted about the grounds, 
shows the careful planning of the landscape archi- 
tect. A soft May breeze was blowing when the 
writer first turned aside from the roadway into 
the school grounds and the perfume of hawthorn 
and lilacs drifted toward him. Picturesque, irregu-
-P-A-G-E-139
  Lawrenceville School 127 
larly shaped structures of red brick, but softened 
in hue, showed themselves in whole or in part 
here and there among the trees. A warm sunlight 
suffused the whole, and made it seem like a spot 
wherein to dream throughout a long summer’s day. 
But only for a moment did this impression remain. 
An unseen bell rang sharply, and like bees when 
their hive is touched, an innumerable army of boys 
swarmed out of the huge archway of a reddish brown 
building at one side of the long oval lawn or campus, 
and their appearance made it quickly evident that 
very little dreaming went on in this particular 
locality. 
Andover, Exeter, Shattuck, and several other 
noted schools, have come to their present estate 
through years of slow and more or less intermittent 
growth, new buildings being erected as funds avail- 
able permitted and necessities demanded ; Lawrence- 
ville, on the contrary, on its present foundation, 
came into being in plan, substantially as it is at pres- 
ent, its latest structures, for the most part, having 
been contemplated in the original scheme and erected
-P-A-G-E-140
128 Some Famous American Schools 
in accordance with it. To a lesser extent the same 
is true of Belmont, while the one comprehensive 
building of Saint Mark’s was in effect contemplated 
from an early period in the history of the institu- 
tion. 
So long ago as 1810 the Reverend Isaac Brown, 
a Presbyterian clergyman, opened a boys’ school in 
Lawrenceville with nine pupils. Of one of these 
nine, John Cleve Green, we shall hear later, while 
another early pupil, if not one of the scholastic 
nine, was John Maclean, a well-known president 
of Princeton College. In 1839 the school became 
the property of the Reverend Samuel Hamill and 
his brother, the Reverend Hugh Hamill, and under 
their management it increased in numbers and 
became much more fully equipped for its purposes. 
Until 1878 the institution was known as the Law- 
renceville Classical High School, and from its 
modest beginnings in 1810 till the year 1878 some 
2,500 boys had been enrolled upon its list of pupils, 
the larger number of them entering college, and very 
many of them becoming distinguished in the legal, 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
Lawrenceville School 129 
medical, and clerical professions, as well as in the 
army and navy. If one may judge from the reminis- 
cences of various pupils during the Hamill period, 
the régime of the Reverend Samuel appears to have 
been one in which leniency and justice were blended 
in about equal proportions. Very possibly it might 
be best described as a benevolent despotism. 
Up to 1878 Lawrenceville was not strongly differ- 
entiated from numbers of other American boarding- 
schools. It was an excellent institution, but so were 
very many others whose rank to-day is much what 
its place then was. But a radical change was in 
store for Lawrenceville—a change due in all 
human probability to the circumstance of John Cleve 
Green having been one of the original boys who at- 
tended the school in 1810, a lifetime earlier. He was 
but a boy of fourteen when he quitted his Lawrence- 
ville home for New York, where his innate business 
faculties developed so rapidly that his employers sent 
him to China to represent the firm. In its main lines 
the tale is familiar, and has been told of many 
beside the Lawrenceville lad. He prospered, as
-P-A-G-E-142
  130 Some Famous American Schools 
merchants had a way of doing in China, married 
the daughter of the head of the firm, and returned 
to America after twenty-five years, prepared to 
enjoy the fortune he had amassed. Charitable insti- 
tutions ere long became acquainted with his name, 
and Princeton College knew him as a benefactor, its 
scientific school resulting from his generous gifts, 
the Chancellor Green Library and the academic 
department being likewise enriched by him. Then, 
in 1876, he died. 
In those years while he was accumulating a for- 
tune among the slant-eyed sages of Cathay his three 
brothers had been graduated from Princeton and 
had risen to prominence in the affairs of New 
Jersey. Henry W. Green had become chief justice 
of the Superior Court and afterward chancellor; 
Caleb A. Green was judge of the Court of Errors 
and Appeals, while George Green was now a 
wealthy lumber merchant; a very fair showing for 
one family. 
John’s surviving brother, Caleb, his nephew, 
Charles E. Green, his friend, John Nixon, and his
-P-A-G-E-143
  Lawrenceville School 131 
widow were named as residuary legatees of the 
larger part of the Green estate, and in 1878 these 
four purchased from the Hamills all the property 
of the Lawrenceville school. They had become 
convinced that an endowed preparatory school for 
boys was much needed in the Middle Atlantic 
States, and particularly in New Jersey, but this 
might have remained in their minds as a theory 
only, had the China merchant not died childless. 
  Each of the legatees possessed a fortune which did 
not need augmenting, and by a happy chance it oc- 
curred to them to employ the fortune left to their 
disposition, in establishing an institution that 
should perpetuate the name of the Lawrenceville 
schoolboy of so long ago, as well as that of the 
school where his mastery of the three R’s had been 
obtained. That Mr. John Green had ever contem- 
plated such a disposition of his property is ex- 
tremely doubtful, but that it was quite in harmony 
with the general trend of his desires is most prob- 
able. 
In 1881 the legatees obtained a charter for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
132 Some Famous American Schools 
school, and the next year appointed James Cameron 
Mackenzie, Ph. D., head master, requesting him to 
prepare an outline of the domestic and educational 
policies of the institution to be henceforth known as 
the “ Lawrenceville School on the John C. Green 
’ Foundation,” a formidable title, which fortunately 
admits of considerable abbreviation. A board of 
seven trustees was then elected, and the school has 
ever since been controlled by them. 
Everything was now ready for what might be 
termed a fresh start, and very speedily was the 
start made. The grounds were enlarged by the 
purchase of neighbouring farm lands, landscape 
architects appeared on the scene, red brick structures 
began to rise in this or that quarter, while the thin 
sound of the trowel clinking against the bricks was 
heard on all sides. When labourers, architects, gar- 
deners, and engineers of various sorts had done their 
work and gone their several ways, the school began 
its life in the new buildings in September, 1884, 
having continued the earlier school system since 
1882 under the new administration.
-P-A-G-E-145
Lawrenceville School 133 
The new system was not only entirely different 
from the one it supplanted, but it differed essentially 
from that of other American preparatory schools. 
In it were incorporated the English “ house” plan 
for sheltering and providing a home for the boys, 
and the New England academy educational model. 
As an experiment it was sufficiently novel to satisfy 
more radical minds, while on the educational side it 
appeared conservative enough to attract the patron- 
age of parents disposed to stand by an established 
order of things. Success is generally held to justify 
the wisdom of an experiment, and Lawrenceville, 
on its new basis, was a success from the beginning. 
Its house system, so novel a feature in American 
preparatory schools, offered an amount of home 
life unattainable in the large dormitories so common 
elsewhere, and appeared to give equal satisfaction to 
parents and pupils. 
At tke time of the establishment of the new 
régime in 1884, the equipment of the institution was 
composed of a large recitation-hall, with study- 
rooms, library, and auditorium attached; six 
   
-P-A-G-E-146
  134 Some Famous American Schools 
houses for the masters and the boys under their 
especial charge; a private residence for the head 
master; bath-house; power-house; and laundry; 
an array of structures constituting almost a small 
village in themselves. If this were the case nearly 
twenty years ago it is even more so at present, for 
with increasing numbers other buildings have been 
added to the large original group — the long and 
spacious Upper House in 1892, the Edith Memorial 
Chapel in 1895, the Lodge, and several lesser build- 
ings at a somewhat later date, and the great gymna- 
sium in 1902. Nearly all the principal buildings are 
ranged about the long oval lawn already mentioned ; 
the gymnasium, and others to be erected at some 
time in the future, will occupy similar topographical 
relations to a second oval, the two then somewhat 
resembling in outline a figure eight. 
In an institution containing some four hundred 
boys it might seem as if the individuality of each 
would be lost in the mass, but at Lawrenceville this 
appears far from being the case. Indeed, the system 
of separate households directly fosters individuality.

Loyalty to the school as a whole abounds, but class 
feeling is weak, while house feeling is strong, and 
this state of things is encouraged by the governing 
authorities. There will be time enough for the 
development of a class spirit in the university, it is 
urged, but in the school the more restricted range of 
feeling is desirable. There is consequently no play- 
ing of games nor athletic contests between forms or 
classes, but much rivalry between teams belonging 
to separate houses. 
Except the members of the fourth form, all the 
boys are required to live in the masters’ houses, five 
of which are within the main grounds looking out 
upon the campus, and six are in the immediate 
vicinity. The number of boys in any house varies 
from seven to thirty-two, and when it exceeds 
sixteen the labours of the resident master and his 
wife are lightened by the presence of an assistant 
master. Probably if the annals of each house were 
minutely written there would occur records of minor 
rebellions and insubordinations, and no sensible 
person would give a copper for any assemblage of 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 Some Famous American Schools 
boys of which this would not be true, but in the long 
run the life in each house is just such a healthy, 
spirited, juvenile existence as it ought to be, not 
perhaps offering a perfect substitute for the life of 
an ideal home, but preferable in many respects to 
that of the average household. 
It was the writer’s privilege on one Sunday even- 
ing to visit one of the Lawrenceville “ houses ” just 
as the boys living there had gathered for their cus- 
tomary Sunday night “sing.” A piano stood in the 
spacious hall, and around it were grouped several 
of the boys, while many more were sitting on the 
stairs and the landings. The resident master stood 
beside the musician at the piano, and the master’s 
wife had seated herself with one or two of the 
smaller lads on a sofa near the stair foot. It was 
a homelike scene, and unless appearances on that 
occasion were more than usually deceptive, the boys 
were enjoying the half-hour of song with just the 
same keenness that they would have done at home. 
If this particular school house were not home, it 
was certainly an extremely good substitute for it,

an unprejudiced person would have said. Glimpses 
of the life in the other houses afforded evidence that 
this particular one was not exceptional in its home 
atmosphere. 
Far back in the writer’s memory linger recollec- 
tions of certain religious school services to which 
he went very much in the spirit of the quarry slave 
scourged to his-dungeon, but as he watched the 
Lawrenceville lads trooping into their school chapel 
through various doorways it seemed to him as if 
they came because they liked to come, astonishing 
as such an assertion in regard to boys may seem. It 
is very true that their attendance was not a matter 
left to their decision, but there was no indication 
in manner or behaviour that attendance was looked 
upon as a hardship. ; 
Nor need it have been, by any boy in his senses. 
There was a short service, including the singing of 
two spirited hymns, and this was followed by a 
brief discourse of a practical nature, from the head 
master, perfectly well adapted to the comprehension 
of his hearers. The organ was superbly played, and  
-P-A-G-E-154
  142 Some Famous American Schools 
| 
the choir of forty boys seated in the apse showed 
the results of careful training. Whatever chapel 
attendance may have been at Lawrenceville in 
remoter periods of its history, it is hard to believe 
that any one regards it as irksome in the twentieth 
century. 
The household system as exemplified at Lawrence- 
ville is so interesting in itself that one is tempted to 
dwell upon it at length, to the exclusion of other 
matters, but it should be said in this connection that 
nowhere else in the United States can it be observed 
to so full advantage, since at no other school is it 
carried out on so large a scale. Whether or not it 
is an ideal one is not within the province of the 
writer to declare, but it has certainly produced the 
most admirable results at Lawrenceville. 
When the building known as the Upper House 
was erected in 1892, the original intention of the 
founders was brought to fulfilment, which was to 
allow the members of the fourth or highest form 
to live in one building by themselves, and with more 
personal freedom than in the masters’ houses. It
-P-A-G-E-155
  
Lawrenceville School 143 
does not follow from this that the general school 
laws become inoperative here, but the government 
of this house differs from that of the others in 
being somewhat of the nature of a republic, and 
in its tendency preparing the boys for the larger 
freedom of college life. 
Two masters and seventy-six boys have their 
home here, the domestic life being controlled by 
a matron, while the government is vested in a board 
of seven directors elected semiannually from among 
the residents of the house. The same arrangement 
holds true of Hamill House, accommodating thirty 
fourth form boys for whom there was no room in 
the Upper House. More than one American school 
has copied this feature of the Upper House, a very 
practical recognition of the excellence of the Law- 
renceville plan. 
While My Lady Nicotine is worshipped in more 
or less secret session in many a school and college, 
her worship, though not precisely encouraged at 
Lawrenceville, is nevertheless recognized to a certain 
extent. The authorities, convinced that gracious  
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 Some Famous American Schools 
concession in part oftentimes accomplishes much 
more than Spartan prohibition, reversed their former 
policy in 1900 and provided smoking-rooms in the 
Upper House in which members of the senior form 
who had received a written permission from home 
to this effect, might smoke cigars and pipes, but not 
cigarettes. Smoking is, however, prohibited else- 
where in the building, and within the grounds, and 
each boy who smokes pledges himself to smoke in 
moderation, as well as to exert his influence to pre- 
vent the younger members of the school from smok- 
ing. One cannot help feeling that the Lawrenceville 
authorities have been wise in forbearing to attempt 
the impossible in the matter of tobacco, and that 
the wisdom of the serpent appears, to a judicious 
extent, of course, in their having thus tactfully 
secured the support of the older members of the 
school in controlling the younger ones in this regard. 
From an architectural standpoint the Lawrence- 
ville structures have in several instances not a little 
to recommend them. The masters’ houses are 
irregularly shaped but effective masses of red brick; 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
 
-P-A-G-E-158

-P-A-G-E-159
  Lawrenceville School 147 
the Upper House, of the same material, with its long 
facade, its assemblage of roofs, and its clustering 
chimneys, is distinctly a building upon which the 
eye may rest with pleasure. Memorial Hall, a 
Romanesque structure of red sandstone in the Rich- 
ardsonian manner, but with less of exaggeration 
than Richardson himself was wont to display, con- 
tains the recitation-rooms and study-halls, and rises 
from out the greensward between the Upper House 
and the Edith Chapel with all the massiveness of a 
Norman fortress. 
The chapel, just beyond it, is a less happy creation 
of the architect, so far as its exterior is concerned. 
It is in memory of John Cleve Green’s daughter 
Edith, who died in infancy, and is a cruciform 
structure of red sandstone with a spired tower in 
the angle formed by the nave and south transept. 
But the width is too great for the height, a common 
fault in modern American churches, and the short, 
octagonal spire, with its broaches, is a chronological 
impertinence upon a Romanesque edifice, since Ro- 
manesque builders employed pyramidal rather than 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
148 Some Famous American Schools 
octagonal cappings for their towers. The western 
doorway is ineffective, and the buttresses are of a 
character which would not be immediately recog- 
nized by Norman builders. But the interior is both 
beautiful and impressive. The majestic sweep of the 
many-windowed apse is a feature that immediately 
takes the eye, while the nave aisles, which serve as 
ambulatories merely, have a character about them 
reminding the observer of similar details in the 
Norman art of Sicily. 
Differing very widely from any other structure 
upon the grounds is the gymnasium, completed in 
1902, and standing on the upper side of what will 
eventually be the second circle or oval. This ath- 
letic temple, as it may be called, is of yellow brick 
and white terra cotta, the latter material employed 
much too profusely for decorative purposes, a temp- 
tation seemingly inseparable from its use at all. It 
consists of a long central portion with a high base- 
ment, and wings set well back at the sides. Among 
its attractions are a swimming-pool seventy-five feet 
long, bowling-alleys, running-track, and innumerable

individual lockers separately heated and ventilated. 
To the uninitiated one modern gymnasium, if not as 
much like another as is my fingers to my fingers, is 
yet in effect a replica of it, but since the Lawrence- 
ville people confidently declare that their gymnasium 
has apparently no equal in any American school, one 
must believe them, since it would be well-nigh impos- 
sible for the non-professional person to undertake to 
establish the contrary. One thing, at least, is cer- 
tain, it would be a most exacting athlete who could 
desire more for his physical development than is to 
be found here. 
The gymnasium holds a conspicuous place in the 
life of the school, every pupil being required to 
exercise a certain number of hours a week within 
it, and swimming, boxing, bowling, wrestling, are 
encouraged, while individual championship contests 
are held weekly. 
It is when one beholds such a school adjunct as 
the Lawrenceville, Groton, or Andover gymnasium 
that one realizes how far we have travelled from the 
days when boys were counselled against wasting 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
    
152 Some Famous American Schools 
any of their valuable hours which should be devoted 
to study, and not dissipated in play. At the earliest 
Methodist college in the world, Cokesbury College, 
at Abingdon, Maryland, the students were pro- 
hibited from playing and were exercised in garden- 
ing instead, in connection with the reading of the 
Georgics. How fully these unfortunates approved 
of this utilitarian disposition of their time history 
fails to record, but one’s sympathies go out warmly 
to these early Methodists. It might have been writ- 
ten of this same institution : 
“ They read botanic treatises 
And works on gardening through there; 
And methods of transplanting trees 
To look as if they grew there.” 
No such Gradgrind system prevails at Lawrence- 
ville. The nearly three hundred acres belonging to 
the institution give ample space for out-of-door 
games in their season. Ten graded playing-fields 
for football and baseball, twenty clay tennis courts, 
and two nine-hole golf courses are some of the re- 
sources that help to mitigate the rigours of scholastic
-P-A-G-E-165
Lawrenceville School 153 
life in this particular spot, and it is fair to presume 
that they are duly made use of. Indeed, every boy 
is obliged to select some description of sport and 
play regularly at it throughout the season. No 
great hardship in the most of instances it may be 
imagined. Five silver cups have been given by the 
alumni for the house championships in baseball, 
football, and track athletics, and the final games 
played by the houses settle the question as to which 
is the best team for the year. 
Lacrosse was a favourite sport at the school till 
1890, and hockey is played in the winter on the 
school pond. Since 1892 representatives of Law- 
renceville have won nine of the interscholastic tennis 
tournaments at Princeton, and have carried off three 
cups. The school teams in football and baseball 
won three out of six football games, and two out 
of seven baseball games in contests with Phillips 
Andover from 1893 to 1899. Since the last-named 
year the Hill School at Pottstown, Pennsylvania, 
has been the principal competitor of the school in 
athletic contests. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  154 Some Famous American Schools 
On the purely scholastic side of life at Lawrence- 
ville, one need touch but lightly here, for the reason 
that detailed descriptions of educational methods 
does not come within the scope of this book. Until 
1902 the two courses of instruction, classical and 
scientific, each covering four years of study, was the 
order, when a five-year course was substituted, a 
change that not only enables some younger lads to 
enter, but provides a fuller and more satisfactory 
schedule of study. The members of the three lower 
forms prepare their lessons in the study-rooms in 
the Memorial Hall, but those of the two upper 
forms are permitted to study in their own rooms, a 
privilege no doubt fully appreciated by those who 
enjoy it, and ardently anticipated by those who view 
it through the vista of one or more years. Each 
master’s house has its own reading-room, stocked 
with periodicals and papers, while the school library 
of five thousand volumes finds harbourage in one 
of the rooms of Memorial Hall. . The two literary 
societies meet for debate on Wednesday evenings, 
and once a year there is a joint debate between them.

A hall for their common use, and a library building 
are among the structures that Lawrenceville hopes 
ere long to see facing the second circle in its 
grounds. On successive Saturday evenings the 
whole school assembles in the auditorium of Memo- 
rial Hall to listen to a lecture, concert, or other en- 
tertainment, and as both Wednesdays and Saturdays 
are half-holidays, it will be seen that the burden of 
study is not suffered to rest too long at a time on the 
shoulders of these young seekers after knowledge. 
There are two Sunday services in the school 
chapel, at both of which the singing is furnished by 
a well-trained choir of forty boys, and with the pres- 
ent trend toward the common-sense details of ritual 
one may anticipate a day not so far distant when 
these boys will be vested for chapel services as are 
choirs of distinctively “ church” schools at present. 
Music at Lawrenceville does not end with the train- 
ing for the choir, for there are more secular musical 
organizations, such as banjo, mandolin, and glee 
clubs, and the school orchestra, and at stated seasons 
concerts are given by these various associations, 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
    158 Some Famous American Schools 
The school has never lacked for either song writers 
or composers, and of all the various songs in the 
school song-book, the following is accepted as the 
distinctive school song. 
IN OLDEN DAYS 
“In olden days, bards sang the praise 
Of maidens, war, or wine, 
But we to-day present our bay 
Before another shrine ; 
We catch the song from voices gone, 
That future hearts shall ever thrill, 
And sing the lays and chant the praise 
Of dear old Lawrenceville. 
And sing the lays and chant the praise 
Of dear old Lawrenceville. 
«“ We sing the campus green and fair, 
We sing the ’lev’n and nine, 
Who battle for the old school there 
And guard the base and line; 
The old school halls, and the old roll-calls, 
And the friendly voices echoing still 
When with the throng, for the cheer or the song, 
In Lawrence, Lawrenceville,” etc. 
«“ Then here’s a cheer for every peer 
Who wears the Black and Red! 
And here’s one more for schoolboy lore, 
And the heart that rules with the head!
-P-A-G-E-171
  
Lawrenceville School 159 
For the old school’s name here’s lasting fame! 
To the end of days may she flourish still! 
And round her stand a loyal band 
To cheer for Lawrenceville !” 
It is not a faultless literary composition, and some 
of the lines have in them more feet than the verses 
will bear, but it has the note of sincerity, and when 
this is present, grammar and rhetoric are, if not 
things of naught, at least matters of lesser impor- 
tance. And if one is still disposed to be critical, it 
is well to remember how few popular songs com- 
mend themselves to the lovers of style in literature. 
Our young barbarians all at play are responsible 
in these later decades for the invention of certain 
heathenish combinations of words and syllables by 
means of which to express in unison the intensity of 
their feelings in moments of great excitement, which 
it pleases them to call cheers, but which maturer per- 
sons denominate Indian yells. Lawrenceville in this 
respect is no whit behind other educational institu- 
tions, as the accompanying “school cheer” bears 
witness.  
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 Some Famous American Schools 
SCHOOL CHEER OF LAWRENCEVILLE 
«“ Halléé genoo genack genack. 
Halléé genoo genack genack. 
Whoo rah, whoo rah. 
Lawrence! Ldwrence! Lawrence!” 
Like the small boy in one of Miss Alcott’s tales 
who had manufactured the interesting expletive 
“Thunder turtles,’ and was very proud of the 
achievement, the Lawrenceville boys appear equally 
enamoured of their success in the manufacture of 
“cheers ” and have evolved various class cheers that 
do equal credit to their ingenuity if to nothing else, 
but the reader is mercifully spared their recital here. 
As is very well known, certain English public 
schools have developed in the lapse of time a local 
vocabulary, familiarity with which betrays the place 
of their training as unerringly as the speech of the 
Cockney bewrayeth him, though far from the sound 
of Bow Bells. Lawrenceville, modern as it is com- 
pared with Winchester or Eton, has yet a few words 
of its own, as well as a few which it shares with 
some other schools. “Jigger” is one of these

terms, and denotes a certain quantity of ice-cream 
served out at the local “ jigger shop,” while a 
“ double-jigger ” is a double quantity of this entic- 
ing viand. “ Shag” is a term employed to signify 
the going around the school circle to work off house 
marks for tardiness, etc. The non-scholastic mind 
would probably be at a loss to unravel the meaning 
of the elegant expression “ hot dog,” but Lawrence- 
ville usage applies it to the boy who, while doing 
something out of the ordinary way, however excel- 
lently, conveys the impression at the same time that 
‘ there is something of the nature of the “ swelled 
head ” about it. 
Under its present foundation Lawrenceville has 
had but two head masters. The first one, the Rever- 
end James Cameron Mackenzie, was in charge of 
the school from 1882 until 1899, and to him is due 
the educational and domestic policy of the institution. 
An able teacher, and a masterly disciplinarian, the 
school prospered under him, but he seems never to 
have gained the hearty affection of either masters or 
pupils. He was succeeded by the Reverend Simon
-P-A-G-E-176
  164 Some Famous American Schools 
John McPherson, D. D., who from 1882 had been 
pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church in Chi- 
cago. He is still in the prime ‘of life, having been 
born in 1850, and under his open-minded, optimistic 
sway Lawrenceville is unlikely to go backward. 
As these great middle schools of America become 
more generally recognized as holding a legitimate 
place in the national life, we may expect that literary 
associations will cluster about them asaround Rugby, 
Harrow, or Winchester. Lawrenceville has not yet 
appeared in what may be called serious fiction, but in 
“Tommy Remington’s Battle,” a story published 
in the Saint Nicholas Magazine for November, 1901, 
several chapters are devoted to the account of a boy’s 
life at Lawrenceville School, chapters, by the way, 
that are full of life and spirit. Something of the 
atmosphere of the place makes itself quickly apparent 
in them to one who knows the life they touch upon. 
But if as yet the literary world knows little of 
Lawrenceville, the school has what may be called a 
literary life of its own, for in addition to the two 
literary societies, the Calliopean, founded in 1818,
-P-A-G-E-177
  Lawrenceville School 165 
and the Philomathean, dating from 1855, there are 
the school’s four publications, — the Olla-Podrida, 
an annual whose contents strictly carry out the impli- 
cation of its name; The Lawrenceville Literary ; 
Magazine, a monthly established in 1895; the Y. M. 
C. A. Handbook; and The Lawrence, a weekly 
newspaper appearing on Wednesdays. It is edited by 
a board of members chosen from the fourth form. 
Unwritten laws there are at Lawrenceville, as at 
other schools, but none the less binding on that 
account, for unformulated tradition often holds 
when constitutions part. It is nowhere nominated in 
the bond that the new boy, however he may excel 
in this or that, shall be reticent in regard to his excel- 
lencies, letting them appear as if they had silently 
stolen upon him without his knowledge, but such is 
the custom, nevertheless, and the sooner the new 
boy perceives it the better for his happiness. Nor is 
he expected to don the school colours of black and 
red until he has completed one full term, at the end 
of which period his worthiness to do so is no doubt 
demonstrated more or less clearly, The school initial
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 Some Famous American Schools 
“L” is awarded to all those who play in the final 
championship games of school sports, and the house 
initial to any boy who makes the house team in any 
sport. 
The Lawrenceville boy who should fail to lift 
his hat to any master who had recognized him would 
be speedily sent to Coventry by his comrades, and the 
same spirit of courtesy keeps him perfectly quiet 
during the dullest of lectures or entertainments, as 
well as prompts him to give the school cheer to those 
who have afforded him pleasure on any occasion 
when the school is gathered in the main hall, or 
auditorium, as it is called, of the school. Athletic 
victories are emphasized by bonfires on the follow- 
ing evening, and by visits to the various houses to 
listen to speeches by the masters. Officers and cap- 
tains of teams are chosen because of their proven 
ability, and not because of their popularity. 
Still other customs there are that may be touched 
upon, which cannot fail to commend themselves. In 
the Mercer Hospital at Trenton is a Lawrenceville 
Room, and to its support the members of the school
-P-A-G-E-179
  Lawrenceville School 167 
contribute liberally. Some seven hundred dollars 
are annually raised for the support of the school 
summer camp near Huntington, Long Island, where 
during the summer season thirty or more poor boys 
from New York City are given a two weeks’ outing. 
The city lads are taken thither in companies of ten 
or twelve at a time, and several of the Lawrenceville 
students volunteer their services in helping the leader 
or supervisor in managing the camp and directing 
the amusements and exercises of its members. This 
wholesome charity is carried on wholly by the free- 
will offerings of the students, and its beneficent ef- 
fects are not experienced by its immediate objects 
alone. 
Almost two decades have slipped away since the 
present system was established at Lawrenceville, and 
within that period its efficiency has been amply tested. 
For a smaller school, where the number does not 
greatly exceed one hundred, it may very well be that 
the Saint Mark’s plan of gathering its entire number 
beneath one roof for all its exercises may be the 
wisest, and where the numbers are greater local con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
| 
168 Some Famous American Schools 
siderations may still determine decision in favour of 
the more usual American dormitory plan. All that 
Lawrenceville would probably claim is that its sepa- 
rate house system had worked admirably in its own 
case, and that possibly it might be equally effective, 
with the necessary local modifications, elsewhere. 
In any case, the Lawrenceville plan offers much of 
interest to the observer and its workngs deserve the 
careful attention of all who are interested in the 
  educational problem which our great middle schools 
are doing their best to solve in their various ways.

Saint Paul’s 
HE famous school at Concord, New Hamp- 
a: shire, which for nearly fifty years has borne 
the name of the apostle Paul, was not the 
earliest American school to bear it. The Flushing 
Institute on Long Island, starting as a boys’ board- 
ing-school in 1828, had become in ten years’ time 
Saint Paul’s College, for eighteen years owned and 
controlled by Reverend William Augustus Muhlen- 
berg, of happy memory. 
Doctor Muhlenberg’s theory of a school was that 
of a family, and he managed Saint Paul’s College on 
this principle. Whether or not the head of a school 
should stand in loco parentis to his pupils may, per- 
haps, be open to debate, but it is not a question to 
concern us here. In what it attempted, Saint Paul’s 
College was a success, and many an American school 
was modelled upon its example, the college of Saint

James, at Hagerstown, Maryland, being one of the 
most important of these earlier copies. 
But the chief existing American school upon the 
Muhlenberg plan, in substance, at least, is Saint 
Paul’s School, at Concord, New Hampshire, incor- 
porated by act of Legislature on the twenty-ninth 
of June, 1855, and first opened on Thursday, the 
third of April, in the following year. Its founder 
was Doctor George Cheyne Shattuck, in whose hon- 
our the Shattuck School at Faribault, Minnesota, 
was named a decade later. The change which the 
lapse of three-quarters of a century had brought 
about in the public mind regarding the functional 
scope of a college preparatory school, may be traced 
when comparing the language of the founder’s deed 
of gift in this case with that of the “ constitutions ” 
of the two Phillips Academies. In the Shattuck 
deed of gift we read that: 
“The founder is desirous of endowing a school 
of the highest class for boys, in which they may 
obtain an education which shall fit them either for 
college or business, including thorough intellectual
-P-A-G-E-185
    Saint Paul’s 173 
training in the various branches of learning; gym- 
nastics and manly exercises adapted to preserve 
health and strengthen the physical condition; such 
zesthetic culture and accomplishments as shall tend 
to refine the manners and elevate the taste, together 
with careful moral and religious instruction.” 
It may be urged that the details of this design are 
‘ , anticipated in the Andover “ constitution,” wherein 
the especial purpose of that institution is “to learn 
them THE GREAT END AND REAL BUSI- 
NESS OF LIVING,” and in the Exeter “ constitu- 
’ ‘ tion” in the clause relating to “such other of the 
Liberal Arts and Sciences or Languages as oppor- 
tunity may hereafter permit,” but neither of these 
documents, unless interpreted in a spirit calculated 
to reduce the original founders to a state of speech- 
less dismay, precisely parallels the provisions of the 
founder’s deed to Saint Paul’s. Certainly to the 
equal emphasis upon physical culture and study in 
the later instrument, the eighteenth-century docu- 
ments not only afford no parallel, but those who
-P-A-G-E-186
174. Some Famous American Schools 
prepared them could not have conceived the possi- 
bility of such equality ever being contemplated. 
The earliest rector of Saint Paul’s School was the 
Reverend Henry Augustus Coit, who had been 
trained for his life-work under Doctor Muhlenberg, 
and had been an instructor in the Hagerstown Col- 
lege. Whatever Saint Paul’s is to-day, in organiza- 
tion, spirit, and ideals, is due to Doctor Coit, who 
was its head from 1856 until his death in 1895. 
Americans of that unreasonably conservative type 
(now fortunately becoming rare, and destined to 
become, let us hope, as extinct as the dodo), to whom 
the unusual is a deadly offence, have now and then 
objected to Saint Paul’s and sister institutions, that 
their nomenclature and some of their customs were 
English rather than American. Saint Paul’s people 
spoke of “ forms” where patriotic Americans were 
’ contented to say “class;” they had “ removes,” 
whatever those mysteries might be; they played at 
cricket, and they attended matins and evensong. 
Wiser persons saw in these details only evidences 
of a wholesome individuality, and were very far
-P-A-G-E-187
  
Saint Paul’s F 175 
from trying to discover in them a slavish imitation 
of English models. When all was said, “ form ” was 
at least quite as good a descriptive term as “ class,” 
and had the merit of long-established usage in its 
favour in this connection, and if it pleased the Saint 
Paul’s people to adopt it and to play at cricket if 
they wished, why let them, to be sure. There was no 
reason in the nature of things why all American 
schools should resemble each other in organizations, 
speech, and customs as much as peas in a pod. 
Moreover, schools of the Saint Paul’s type, being 
distinctively “church” schools, not unnaturally re- 
flected to some small extent certain externals of the 
great English schools controlled by the Established 
Church. That they should not have done so would 
have been indeed a matter for surprise. Incidental 
reproduction of English usages was to be looked for, 
and if these usages chanced to be excellent in them- 
selves, there was no occasion for mental excitement 
on the part of over-patriotic Americans. 
But Saint Paul’s has successfully lived down the 
opposition, both active and passive, to which its 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
176 Some Famous American Schools 
establishment gave rise, and has proved its excellence 
in its especial field by nearly a half-century record 
of honourable achievement. But misconceptions re- 
garding the work of any important school or other 
institution are apt to spring up, affecting more or 
less the attitude of outsiders in respect to it, and 
compelling its friends to devote much time to dispell- 
ing them. One may frequently hear, for example, 
that the Lawrenceville School has an endowment 
of five or ten million, the amount varies according 
to the imagination of the speaker, and it may very 
well be that a slight feeling of envy has been un- 
consciously aroused in the bosoms of the authorities 
of other schools who find themselves hampered in 
many ways by insufficient endowment. As a matter 
of fact this tale of Lawrenceville’s exceeding afflu- 
ence may be given as much credence, and no more, 
as the legend of the founding of Rome. It was 
generously endowed by its founders, but its income 
does not permit of any expenditure but the most well 
considered, and like many schools less well equipped,

it is obliged to await the accumulation of funds when 
new enterprises are desired. 
Whatever prejudices there may once have been in 
certain quarters against Saint Paul’s on the score of 
its being a “church” school, have long since van- 
ished, but one cannot escape hearing the assertion 
made that Saint Paul’s boys are kept so continuously 
in an atmosphere of church-going that when once 
emancipated from it, they determine to go to church 
thereafter as little as possible. No doubt that just 
this same declaration of ecclesiastical independence 
has been made now and then by Saint Paul’s gradu- 
ates, as it has been made by those from other 
schools, but it may be seriously questioned if it indi- 
cates the existence of any such general spirit. It is 
at least a supposable case that these ecclesiastical 
insurgents would have acted on the principle of 
abstention from church attendance if they had never 
heard of Saint Paul’s. One thing, at least, is very 
clear to the writer, which is that whatever may have 
been the case in the earlier decades of the school’s 
history, at present the flame of devotion in the juve- 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 Some Famous American Schools 
nile bosom runs no risk of being extinguished by 
multiplicity of church services or weight of ritual. 
The boy who would seriously cavil at the present 
requirements at Saint Paul’s in this regard would 
most probably object to any restraint at all upon his 
freedom of movement. It is quite conceivable that a 
boy might not like to attend church; it is much less 
likely that he would regard the amount of attend- 
ance required of him at Saint Paul’s in the light of 
a hardship. 
It is not so very long ago that the writer passed 
a Sunday at Saint Paul’s. At half-past eleven in the 
morning there was a service in the school chapel 
lasting not much over an hour, and at half-past three 
came the service of evensong, measurably shorter. 
No doubt the far-off Puritan ancestors of these 
lads, who shivered in fireless meeting-houses while 
they hearkened to sermons of interminable length, 
and incomprehensible substance, would have been 
decorously thankful in their childhood to have been 
able to exchange their Sabbatarian experiences for

the abbreviated services in the chapel of Saint 
Paul’s. 
Two miles west of the Main Street of the city 
of Concord, New Hampshire, the Dunbarton high- 
way makes a gradual descent to the valley of the 
Turkey River, where nearly two centuries ago the 
stream was widened into a pond by the construction 
of a dam to serve the needs of a saw-mill and a grist- 
mill. The district had been known as the Lower 
Mills for some length of time, and there were a few 
houses in the vicinity when Doctor Shattuck, whose 
stuummer residence it had been, conceived the idea of 
founding a school here. For its purposes the site 
of the school was not ill chosen. The valley is ir- 
regular in shape, its windings affording considerable 
variety of outline and offering advantages in the 
way of building sites which a more level territory 
would have lacked. 
A half-century ago, besides the mills, the brick 
house of the founder, a small district school, and a 
farmhouse or two, there were no other buildings at 
this point on the Dunbarton road. Now the sixty
-P-A-G-E-196
  184 Some Famous American Schools 
buildings great and small, connected with the school, 
with several others not belonging to it, constitute 
a goodly village in themselves. From the eastern 
boundaries of the school property, where the highway 
begins its leisurely descent, there is a somewhat 
extended prospect to southward, but as one goes 
westward, the views, though sufficiently pleasing, are 
circumscribed. 
The first building of Saint Paul’s passed in going 
in this direction is the Alumni Hall, a spacious struc- 
ture, exceedingly attractive as to its interior, erected 
in very recent years, as a house of entertainment for 
visiting alumni and other guests, and the last is 
the immense Upper School now (1903) building, 
on the rising ground above the river on its western 
side, the distance between the two being at least a 
third of a mile. The grounds attached to the insti- 
tution comprise about two thousand acres of wood- 
land, farmland, and water area, and infinite possibili- 
ties in the way of playing-fields are here, needing 
only the expenditure of large sums to render them 
available.

Not that much has not already been done in this 
direction, as the visitor soon discovers when some 
loyal son of Saint Paul’s has piloted him about from 
one field to another and sedulously pointed out all 
their many excellencies from the athletic point of 
view, but the capabilities are even more interesting, 
and one cannot help anticipating the time when, 
through the generosity of loyal alumni, they will 
be utilized to their full extent. 
Architecturally Saint Paul’s offers less of interest 
as a whole than Groton or Lawrenceville, or perhaps 
Saint Mark’s. It is less showy than Shattuck with 
its huge stone tower, less picturesque, it may be, than 
Belmont. But Saint Paul’s was a gradual evolution 
from a small beginning. There was no thought of 
architecture in anybody’s mind when it was founded. 
Americans who knew or cared anything at all about 
architecture in the fifties were almost as scarce as 
hens’ teeth, and what they thought about it in the 
sixties or early seventies was seldom worth much, 
and in the majority of cases had better never have 
been thought at all. 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  188 Some Famous American Schools 
But while Saint Paul’s as a whole is less interest- 
ing architecturally than Groton or Lawrenceville, or 
several middle schools of even later date, this is not 
to say that architecture, as architects understand it, 
is not represented here. Overlooking the river just 
above the dam is the new library building given to 
the school and designed by the well-known architect, 
Ernest Flagg. It is of white granite, roofed with 
the reddest of tiles, and its exterior is disappointing, 
despite the really fine entrance portico. It impresses 
the beholder as startlingly new, and not for another 
generation will it take on that air of repose which a 
library, of all structures, should possess. But the 
interior seems admirably adapted for the purposes 
of a comparatively small school library — an octag- 
onal central reading-room, lighted from a dome, 
and easily converted into an effective lecture-hall 
by the removal of its furniture, and, circling about 
it, the several departments of the library proper. 
The great building in process of erection on the 
slope west of the river was too much obscured by 
scaffolding to be seen to advantage at the time of
-P-A-G-E-201
Saint Paul’s 189 
the writer’s visit, but it is a very distinctive advance 
upon all the buildings which preceded it, with a 
single exception, the chapel, and its irregular out- 
line is a merit in itself. One of its especial features 
is a lofty and spacious dining-hall. Whether the 
rather pale brick of which it is built will ever as- 
sume the mellow hue which lends so great a charm 
to certain century-old houses in Mount Vernon 
Street, in Boston, only future generations will know 
for a certainty, but the probabilities are that it will 
not. 
The single exception noted in the preceding para- 
graph is one of extreme importance, however, for at 
the time of its erection in 1888, it was surpassed in 
excellence by no school or college chapel in the 
United States. Thirty years earlier Bowdoin Col- 
lege had erected a chapel whose interior followed 
in its general lines the usual design of such struc- 
tures at English colleges. It was lofty as well as 
long and narrow, and it was for a long time the 
best building of its kind at any American college. 
It was an object-lesson, so far as its interior was  
-P-A-G-E-202
  190 Some Famous American Schools 
concerned, in college chapel construction, but one 
that unfortunately was far too little heeded. 
The chapel at Saint Paul’s follows much more 
closely than that at Bowdoin the English type of col- 
lege chapel, its interior resembling more nearly that 
of the chapel of Marlborough College, than any 
other. It was designed by the Boston architect, 
Henry Vaughan, and the style adopted is that of the 
Curvilinear development of the Middle Pointed, or 
Decorated style. It is of red brick and red sand- 
stone, and its outline includes a nave and ante-chapel 
with west tower and what from its position may be 
called a tower transept, and a constructional choir 
swith organ chamber. The entire length is one hun- 
dred and fifty feet, and the apex of the ceiling is 
fifty feet above the floor. A lofty reredos of carved 
oak, the gift of Cornelius Vanderbilt in memory of 
his son William Henry, who died in 1892, is the 
most conspicuous feature of the choir. With its 
gilding and colours it is at present a little too ob- 
trusive to be altogether pleasing, but when age has 
darkened the woodwork the general effect will be

improved. Carved stone sedilia are placed on the 
south side of the sanctuary, and on the north side 
is the recumbent marble statue of the school’s first 
rector, Reverend Henry Augustus Coit. High 
above the choir stalls on the south side is the organ. 
The seats in the nave face each other across the aisle, 
and a row of oaken stalls lines the walls behind 
them on each side. A carved oak screen with gates 
divides the nave from the ante-chapel, and above it 
is a small gallery. 
The stone tracery of the windows of nave and 
choir is of good design, but the stained glass which 
fills the most of them need not excite in the beholder 
any particular enthusiasm. That in the heading of 
the great east window is the most effective. Deeper, 
richer colours might have been used to greater ad- 
vantage, while the introduction of so many figures 
as are here represented hardly commends itself. 
But the subject of modern stained glass is a danger- 
ous one, to be carefully avoided by him who would 
live peaceably with his neighbours. 
As the writer looked down from his seat above the  
-P-A-G-E-206
194 Some Famous American Schools 
ante-chapel screen, upon Saint Paul’s three hundred 
and fifty boys, it seemed to him, as to his compan- 
ion, that the type represented was of a slightly more 
intellectual character than that to be traced at Law- 
renceville, although at the latter school the type 
is distinctly higher than it was a decade ago. It 
may have been purely a matter of fancy with the two 
observers in the gallery of Saint Paul’s, but it was 
a fancy they shared in common, and they likewise 
agreed in thinking the type observable at Exeter in- 
dicated a finer strain than that at Andover, but here 
again they would not wish to dogmatize, and if 
mistaken are very willing to be convinced of the fact. 
If, however, the differences apparently noted do 
really exist, the causes may be easily traced to their 
legitimate source, — original environment of the 
  majority of the lads, in each school, their ancestry, 
their local training. The Saint Paul boys, in phy- 
sique, resemble more nearly the boys at some such 
English school as Winchester, rather than their 
compatriots at Lawrenceville, Andover, or Shattuck. 
In other words, they are slighter, less stocky, as one

may say, than the generality of American boys of 
the same class. It is the common impression that 
English lads are much stouter in build than Ameri- 
can, but however true this may have been at one 
time, it is not true at present, in the writer’s opinion, 
founded upon observations in both England and 
the United States. 
Next to its scholarship Saint Paul’s prides itself 
upon its prowess in rowing, possibly even more, 
in the opinion of undergraduates. Be this as it may, 
interest in rowing was awakened in the earliest 
days of the school’s history, and a generation ago 
this was greatly quickened by the formation of the 
Shattuck and Halcyon rowing clubs in 1871. Not 
a few famous oarsmen of the past in American uni- 
versities and colleges had their earliest training 
on Long Pond, a sheet of water two miles to the 
northwest of the school. How dear to the heart 
of the Saint Paul students is this particular form 
of sport is shown by the presence of the rowing- 
tank in the school gymnasium, a building com- 
pleted in 1879. 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
    
198 Some Famous American Schools 
After rowing, cricket comes next in favour here, 
and indeed is reckoned as especially the school 
game, since from the nature of things rowing is a 
sport in which but a limited number of the school 
can indulge. The founder brought with him from 
England in 1857 a cricket outfit, and the earliest 
cricket clubs were started in 1859. The cricket 
clubs of the present day contest for challenge cups 
given to the school from time to time for this pur- 
pose. The first cricket-house was built in 1880, but 
was removed in 1893, its site being occupied by the 
present Athletic House. Racquet courts were 
added to the attractions of Saint Paul’s in 1882, 
and the Fives Courts of the Lower School were the 
popular novelty of 1896. 
A level stretch of turf to the south of the school, 
below which winds the Turkey River, is known to 
Saint Paul’s men as the “ Lower Grounds.” It is 
an exceptionally pleasant spot, nearly if not quite 
surrounded by a line of white birches whose pale, 
slender trunks gleam out among the leaves, but it 
is not to be supposed that its natural beauty appeals

to enthusiastic schoolboys when an exciting game 
is on. These grounds include a running track, 
football fields, and tennis courts and the Athletic 
House, already mentioned. Golf links there are in the 
western limits of the school property, and whatever 
else is needful for the physical culture of the sons 
of Saint Paul’s, it is fair to presume that they have, 
since it is not the policy of the school to stint in this 
direction. 
Owing to the extent of territory occupied by the 
various buildings of the school, one does not at 
first realize its importance so far as size is con- 
cerned, or receive that impression of the omnipresent 
boy which is so often gained at much smaller schools 
where the buildings are more compactly clustered. 
It is only after one has moved in diagonals from one 
portion of the estate to another, that the full scope 
of the institution begins to make itself felt, nor is 
the number of students appreciated till one has come 
upon them precipitating themselves en masse from 
schoolroom or gymnasium. And if one chances 
to meet them filing along the walk between the chapel 
   
-P-A-G-E-214
202 Some Famous American Schools 
and the Lower School, for instance, he will be ready 
to declare that instead of three hundred and fifty 
there are nearer three thousand. 
  What Saint Paul’s loses in architectural effect 
from the scattered character of its many buildings 
and the hopelessly uninteresting exterior of some of 
them, is more than made up in the minds of many 
observers, at least, in the picturesqueness afforded by 
their apparently haphazard disposition, and the his- 
toric evidence of growth from small things, an 
impression certainly not received at Groton or 
Lawrenceville, even although the latter school in its 
Hamill House possesses a fabric older than anything 
at Saint Paul’s, but which, as it does not form a 
portion of the general architectural scheme, may be 
overlooked in considering the impression obtained 
of the whole. Those who have watched from one 
decade to another the gradual development of the 
Concord school, from what is playfully termed its 
“Saxon period” to the present, would hardly be 
willing to exchange its architectural equipment, into 
which the history of the school is inextricably inter-
-P-A-G-E-215
Saint Paul’s 203 
woven, for the stateliness of Lawrenceville’s modern 
grouping, Groton’s air of youthful newness, or Bel- 
mont’s atmosphere of completeness. 
To each its own. In the lapse of years the newest 
of the schools and the most recent of its buildings 
will gradually assume the aspect of dignified 
maturity that is oftentimes considered so desirable 
in things scholastic, while the older ones will pass 
into the catalogue of things venerable unless icono- 
clasts arise with a mania for having everything “ up- 
to-date,” to employ the atrocious slang of the 
period. 
Despite its half-century record Saint Paul’s has 
seen but little change in its headship. Its first rector, 
Doctor Henry Coit, lived to see the school, with its 
original three pupils, to which he came in April, 
1856, become the great institution of to-day, known 
far and wide throughout the United States, with its 
graduates scattered along almost every walk of 
American life, and its single building multiplied 
sixty-fold. He died February fifth, 1895, and Saint

statue, already mentioned, but a memorial window 
to him above its entrance. Statue and painted pane, 
these are the conventional memorials of this great 
American teacher, but the actual memorial is in part 
the school to whose welfare he devoted the labour of 
forty years, and in part — and by far the larger part 
—the hundreds of American lives which have felt 
the impress of his strong, Christian character, which 
are better fitted for the stress of living because of 
him. He might without doubt have worn the mitre 
had he so chosen, and prominent churches would 
have gladly had him to minister to them, but he was 
not to be persuaded to leave the work to which he 
had been so genuinely called. 
He was succeeded as rector by his brother, Dr. 
Joseph Howland Coit, who had been vice-rector since 
1865, and to whom every school detail was thor- 
oughly familiar. He has for some time been inca- 
pacitated by ill health from active duty, and during 
his absence in Europe at the present time (June, 
1903), his younger brother, J. Milnor Coit, presides 
e
-P-A-G-E-217
  Saint Paul’s 205 
as acting rector. His labours are shared by forty 
resident masters. 
From the saintly Muhlenberg the first rector 
imbibed his loco parentis theory of school manage- 
ment, and upon this principle Saint Paul’s has ever 
been conducted. It has undergone some minor 
modifications inseparable from changed conditions 
brought about by increasing numbers and altera- 
tions in customs, but in the main it continues domi- 
nant and its workings are apparent in many direc- 
tions. The present acting rector is open-minded and 
disposed to consider the welfare of the school in 
preference to the maintenance of theories, but that 
any radical change will be made in the governing 
principle is unlikely. Saint Paul’s success in the past 
has come about through its obedience to the Muhlen- 
berg theory, and there appear at present no adequate 
reasons for reversing the policy of the last half 
century. 
On the face of things it might appear well-nigh 
impossible to carry into effect such a principle in 
dealing with between three and four hundred boys, 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  206 Some Famous American Schools 
and the writer is by no means able to explain how the 
impossible is attained in this particular instance, but 
that it is so attained he has very little doubt. Un- 
ceasing application, and a most careful disposition 
of time on the part of the governing authorities, are 
probably responsible for much of the success in this 
regard. 
In the earlier history of the school it is recorded 
that the rising bell rang at five in the morning, a 
custom happily passed into oblivion long since, for 
whatever may be the delights of that “ untoward 
hour,” as it may be styled, when the dew lies glitter- 
ing over the grass and there is a faint prospect of 
meeting the rosy milking-maid of romance, contin- 
ued observance of that hour for rising would make 
life anything but one grand, sweet song. Still, if 
one is obliged to do the work of several men in the 
time of one, there must be a striving after the heroic, 
and the acting rector of Saint Paul’s, mindful, possi- 
bly, of the circumstance that, according to report, the 
Waverley novels were all written before breakfast, 
rises at six o’clock the year round, and begins the

day by a visit to the school infirmary, the first of 
seven daily visits made by him to that adjunct of 
the institution when any of its beds are tenanted. 
Much can be accomplished, indeed, when one 
treads so closely as this upon Aurora’s heels, or even 
precedes her at certain seasons of the year, and it is 
this same spirit, shown in a detail like this, which 
when carried out in many others doubtless makes 
it possible for the heads of a school to preserve an 
intimate knowledge of the boys entrusted to their 
care. The loco parentis principle as a working 
theory applied to the training of younger boys will 
no doubt be conceded by most persons to be the best, 
and in the majority of schools is really put in prac- 
tice. When applied in the case of older pupils such 
as those in the upper forms, the desirability may, as 
was remarked on a previous page, be open to debate. 
In the university life it is very certain that no 
such theory can be successfully carried out, except 
in a very few details, and colleges which have at- 
tempted it have failed more or less completely in 
its enforcement. If self-reliance is ever to be

210 Some Famous American Schools 
acquired a beginning must be made in college, if one 
is not to enter the larger world all unprepared for 
its strife, and in the opinion of the heads of some 
preparatory schools the beginning may be made in 
the last year of school life, as a prelude to the fuller, 
freer life of college and university, and the still 
wider existence in the world at large. Local condi- 
tions have their due influence, however, and in a 
secluded locality like Saint Paul’s a theory of school 
management may be advisable which at Lawrence- 
ville, Exeter, or Andover would be in the main 
inexpedient. To each, again, its own. 
Saint Paul’s has not figured in literature in any 
but the most casual way, so far as a locale for novel 
or poem is concerned, but it has sent out into the 
world not a few who have become famous in litera- 
ture. The monthly school periodical, the Hore 
Scholastice, was established in June, 1860, and a 
search among its files would reveal the very earliest 
“efforts” (a happily descriptive term as applied to 
schoolboy effusions oftentimes) of the well-known 
novelists, Francis Marion Crawford, Owen Wister,
-P-A-G-E-223
  Saint Paul’s 211 
and Winston Churchill. Other names there are of 
Saint Paul’s boys also known to the literary world, 
such as those of Stephen Bonsal, William Roscoe 
Thayer, James Barnes, and John Jay Chapman, 
the essayist. 
As a preparation for work in the Hore Scholas- 
tice, a literary society called The Cadmean was 
formed in 1885, and a second one, The Concordian, 
in 1898. The Hore does not differ materially from 
other school periodicals. It is extremely well 
printed, shows care in editing, and is newsy, as such 
a publication should be. From its pages the out- 
sider obtains a very fair notion of the current of 
school life, albeit certain allusions here and there 
might partake to him somewhat of the nature of 
Elusinean mysteries. But one expects that in school 
papers, as a matter of course. 
There is much at Saint Paul’s upon which one 
might like to touch, but the details already men- 
tioned are perhaps those the most likely to impress 
one seeing the institution for the first time. In gen- 
eral outlines the school work in the middle schools

212 Some Famous American Schools 
does not differ very much as one school is compared 
with another. Its details, except in the case of the 
professed student of educational systems, do not 
take strong hold of the memory. The visitor re- 
members vaguely what was told him of the study 
customs of one school until he finds himself at an- 
other, and then his first vague notions are still fur- 
ther obscured by what he learns of similar details 
at the second. 
But certain matters, like position, buildings, man- 
ners, and customs, and whatever pertains to a 
school’s individuality, the visitor does remember, and 
it is the ordinary observer’s impressions of such 
as these that are here recorded in relation to Saint 
Paul’s.

N the midst of pleasing, though by no means 
I striking scenery, a region of low, rounded 
hills, shallow valleys, and tilled farm lands 
banded by strips of woodland, the traveller through 
central Massachusetts, when half-way between Fra- 
mingham and Marlborough, comes suddenly upon 
what appears like a group of many windowed and 
gabled structures standing on rising ground not far 
from the railway station in Southborough. But for 
the very chapel-like appendage visible from some 
points of view, the buildings might be taken for those 
of a summer hotel with its flag floating from the tall 
mast before it. But although in these days of ours 
a library may very well be numbered among the at- 
tractions of a hotel, who ever heard of a chapel as 
one of them, at least of an American one? If nota 
hotel, then, surmises the traveller, this must be a 
215

school, and he is right. He is looking at Saint 
Mark’s School at Southborough, a name familiar to 
schoolboys for more than a generation. 
As one leaves the village and comes nearer to 
the school, the group of buildings it may at first have 
seemed to be is found to be but one in reality, a 
circumstance sharply differentiating Saint Mark’s 
from many of the influential preparatory schools of 
America. Where other important schools have 
purposely planned to separate their members into 
several household groups, as notably at Lawrence- 
ville, Saint Mark’s has as intentionally pursued an 
opposite course and brought its entire life under 
one roof. Each method has its distinct advantages, 
and, no doubt, its enthusiastic advocates. The ques- 
tion practically resolves itself to a matter of num- 
bers. The system that works well at Saint Mark’s, 
with its one hundred and twenty-five boys, would 
scarcely be feasible at Lawrenceville, with its larger 
numbers. That which makes for convenience and 
simplicity at the smaller school might very well 
bring about complexity and confusion in the larger.

The wisdom of each system as applied in particular 
instances must be judged by its practical workings 
in such differing types of schools as these of Law- 
renceville and Southborough. 
Save incidentally in the magazine tale already 
named on a previous page, the New Jersey school 
has never figured in literature, but it is reasonably 
certain that St. Mark’s is the locale, more or less 
idealized, to be sure, of that most spirited as well as 
natural portrayal of boy life at school, “ Antony 
Brade,” by the third master of the school, the Rever- 
end Robert Traill Spence Lowell, an:elder brother 
of the author of “The Biglow Papers.” Thirty 
years have elapsed since the book was written, it 
is true, and the school, with its neighbourhood, has 
seen many changes in that time, but the tale re- 
mains true to essential conditions yet prevailing at 
Saint Mark’s, and may be accepted as a faithful 
study of a wholesome, healthful school life. It is 
much pleasanter reading, on the whole, than that 
somewhat overrated book, “Tom Brown at 
Rugby,” and one receives from, its entertaining
-P-A-G-E-232
  220 Some Famous American Schools 
pages the impression of a healthy, happy life at 
school; just the kind of existence, indeed, that Saint 
Mark’s aims to afford her charges of the present. 
Saint Mark’s is happily placed. The building 
fronts the south, forming three sides of a quad- 
rangle, of which a cloistered passage, connecting the 
east and west wings, constitutes the fourth. A stone 
gate-house, gabled and cross-tipped, forms the cen- 
tral feature of the cloister, and above its arched 
entrance is the winged lion of Saint Mark, with the 
motto of the school appearing below, “ Age Quod 
Agis.” A much happier inscription, indeed, than 
one which the author of the “ Heir of Redclyffe” 
assured the writer she herself saw sculptured be- 
neath the open mouth of a carven lion at the door- 
way of an infant school in a small English town, 
— “ Suffer little children to come unto me and for- 
bid them not.” No such grim welcome as this con- 
fronts the new boys who year by year find their way 
to Southborough and the shelter of Saint Mark’s. 
A chapel of several bays and with an apsidal end 
forms a southern prolongation of the west wing, and

is entered from the cloisters, as well as from the low, 
spired tower on its west side. It is a Romanesque 
structure of excellent proportions, and if we enter 
we shall find an interior that is both simple and 
impressive. There is a lofty, open-timbered roof 
with massive hammer-beams, oaken seats follow the 
lines of the building, and there is a small organ in 
its organ chamber on the east side. The seats for 
the vested choir of St. Mark’s boys are raised a 
single step above the nave, and the chord of the apse 
is marked by the altar rail. The chapel was a gift 
to the school by Mr. August Belmont in memory of 
his brother, Raymond Rodgers Belmont, while clois- 
ters and gateway commemorate Arthur Welland 
Blake. 
As at Saint Paul’s and several other American    schools under the control of the Episcopal Church, 
English customs and nomenclature are followed to 
a slight extent. Consequently one hears of “ forms ” 
‘ instead of classes; of an “ upper school,” and of 
Christmas, Easter, and Trinity terms. 
There are six forms at Saint Mark’s, a year being
-P-A-G-E-236
      
    224 Some Famous American Schools 
required for the work of each. The fifth and sixth 
forms constitute the “ upper school,” and to arrive 
at this stage of scholastic progress is the goal of 
all the younger boys. The members of the “ upper 
school,” it should be known, are favoured above 
their fellows, for to them is accorded the privilege of 
studying in their own rooms, and other distinctions 
are theirs, no doubt, in return for having climbed 
so far up the hill of learning. 
The boys of the three lower forms are not as- 
signed to separate rooms but to dormitories with 
windowed alcoves. An air of almost military sim- 
plicity pervades their quarters, for the members of 
these forms are not permitted to surround them- 
selves with very much in the way of impedimenta. 
Accumulation of that character comes about only 
with translation to rooms of their own, when they 
shall have become “ upper form” fellows. Adjoin- 
ing each dormitory is a master’s room, a natural 
conjunction not perhaps fully appreciated on the 
part of the occupants of the dormitories. 
There is not unnaturally a good deal of rivalry
-P-A-G-E-237
a

-P-A-G-E-239
  Saint Mark’s School 2277 
among the forms, but it is of a healthful character, 
confined to advancement in school work and to 
prowess in athletics. One hears often of “ Saint 
Mark’s Scholars,” for although all of the pupils are 
hers in the wider sense, there are at least six boys 
who are Saint Mark’s Scholars in a very special 
sense indeed. These are the fortunate winners of 
scholarships, the highest with an income of four 
hundred dollars, two of two hundred each, with 
three more to which no stipend is attached, but 
which are allotted to boys of the highest rank. In 
each form, also, there are prizes awarded for a cer- 
tain specified rank in conduct and attainments, and 
Founder’s Medal is the coveted prize of that member 
of the graduating class who stands the highest above 
a specified rank, of course, in both studies and con- 
duct, for the previous three years. The holder of 
the Founder’s Medal at Saint Mark’s certainly earns 
his honours. 
Athletics are encouraged within reason at South- 
borough, and the privileges of the spacious athletic 
field, given not so long ago by Mr. August Belmont,
-P-A-G-E-240
  228 Some Famous American Schools 
and of the Fives Courts, also, are very fully appre- 
ciated. Athletic victories are always made festival 
occasions at Saint Mark’s. The meets of the Ath- 
letic Association are important local events, and the 
Groton spring game calls out a tremendous deal of 
enthusiasm when it comes to Southborough. As 
the sons of William of Wykeham’s ancient founda- 
tion at Winchester send forth their famous “‘ Dulce 
Domum ” on occasions of rejoicing, so do St. Mark’s 
boys respond to a school victory with their school 
song: 
“ Above thy gates the Lion bold, 
Proud emblem which for years has told 
The story how, in strenuous game, 
Thy sons have fought for thy fair name. 
Symbol of strength! thy name we sing, 
O Lion with the Eagle’s wing.” 
The doubtful experiment, as it appeared to some, 
‘“ of founding a “church”’ school in New England, 
in the fifties, soon ceased to be in any sense doubt- 
ful, and ere Saint Paul’s School had completed its 
tenth year its dormitories were filled, and appli- 
cants for admission could obtain it only after a

long period of waiting. Evidently the time was ripe 
for establishing a similar foundation elsewhere in 
New England, and so in 1865 Saint Mark’s was 
founded by Mr. Joseph Burnett. It was its founder’s 
intention that it should be a “ home school,” and 
such it continues to be at this day when, from a 
building sheltering twelve boys, it contains, still 
under one roof, one hundred and _ twenty-five. 
“That the entire life of the school should be under 
one roof,” writes one of its masters, “ its chapel ser- 
vices, study, recitations, eating, and sleeping, means 
much, not only for convenience, but also for com- 
munity of interest among the boys, and between 
masters and pupils.” 
The larger part of the present school fabric was 
completed in 1890, the architect being Henry Forbes 
Bigelow, an alumnus of Saint Mark’s, but in 1902 
another wing was added to the structure, in which 
laboratories and a library are provided. 
In its thirty-seven years of existence the school 
has had six head masters, the third of whom
-P-A-G-E-244
F | f 
232 Some Famous American Schools 
was the Reverend Robert Lowell, already men- 
tioned. Upon his removal to Schenectady in 
1873 he was succeeded by the Reverend James 
I. T. Coolidge, who resigned in 1882, and has 
long been an honoured resident of Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. The fifth head master, Mr. 
William E. Peck, remained at the head of Saint 
Mark’s for eleven years, and had the satisfac- 
tion of seeing the institution greatly increase in 
strength and efficiency during that period. His 
skilful management, indeed, made possible much that 
is now doing at Saint Mark’s. Upon his leaving in 
1893 to found a school in Pomfret, Connecticut, the 
present head master succeeded, the Reverend Will- 
iam Greenough Thayer. 
From the beginning the various members of the 
Burnett family have been watchful for the interests 
of the school. Discouragements and obstacles there 
were at the outset, but these the founder overcame 
by his persistency and foresight, serving for many 
years as its treasurer, an office in which he was fol-

lowed by his son, Mr. Harry Burnett, who is also 
a trustee of the school. 
Year by year Saint Mark’s grows more attractive 
to the eye. Nature, as Mr. Lowell has said, took 
kindly to her, enfolding her in ivies and woodbines, 
and permitting the friendly grass to come close to 
her feet. And in these very latest years her work 
has been intelligently supplemented, for even kindly 
Mother Nature needs not only encouragement but 
some little well-meant hints now and then as to the 
best methods of doing things. Accordingly shrub- 
bery has been judiciously planted, trees set out in 
effective conjunction, lawns made soft as velvet, 
while indoors, photographs and casts render the 
already attractive interior yet more so. 
Such is Saint Mark’s School to-day. A homelike 
institution admirably following out the aims of its 
founder, and sending into the world of university 
life, or into the larger world of business, those for 
whom a well-balanced system of school training has 
done whatever training can do, toward equipping 
them for the future. Saint Mark’s has given them
-P-A-G-E-248

the education she deems most fitting for the sons of 
Christian gentlemen, and sends them forth from her 
walls in the confident expectation that they will 
prove themselves all that Christian gentlemen should 
be.

   Shattuck School 
7. story of Shattuck is the old tale of the 
slow development of strength from weak- 
ness, of gradual evolution from small, un- 
promising conditions to fuller life and ampler oppor- 
tunities. And thirty-five years have seen it all. 
In the minds of nine persons out of ten Minnesota 
and Bishop Whipple are names that are inseparable. 
No matter what the person’s creed may chance to 
be, he expects to find the modern “ Apostle to the 
Indians”” more or less intimately associated with 
* whatever is best in Minnesota, and it is no surprise, 
therefore, to come upon the shining track of the 
good bishop on the very first pages of the history 
of the great preparatory school of the Middle West, 
the Shattuck School at Faribault, Minnesota. 
To this spot on the frontier had come in 1857 the 
Reverend James Breck, with the intention of found- 
239
-P-A-G-E-252
  240 Some Famous American Schools 
ing a school for pupils of all grades. A forlorn 
hope, it would have seemed to most of us. What is 
now the lovely town of Faribault was then a small 
settlement in the midst of a region inhabited mainly 
by Indians, whom the generality of persons believed 
to be practically untamable, and surrounded by the 
most primitive conditions of life on the edge of 
American civilization in the West. But he was not 
a person easily discouraged, missionaries in any 
cause seldom are, it will be found, and presently he 
had a day school established, a small affair, it is true, 
but still he had made a beginning. 
In May of 1860, the newly consecrated Bishop 
Whipple visited Faribault, and with his keen per- 
ception of possibilities he gazed into the future and 
saw Faribault a cathedral city with schools and 
seminaries clustered about a common centre, the 
church. In a very short time the small day school 
was incorporated as the “ Bishop Seabury Mission,” 
for “the diffusion of religion and learning.” In 
1864 Seabury Hall was built as a theological semi- 
nary, and the next winter several lads were received
-P-A-G-E-253
     Shattuck School | 241 
into the hall among the divinity students, and thus 
the nucleus of a grammar school was formed. 
It soon became manifest that any such arrange- 
ment could be only temporary, and Shattuck Hall, 
built in 1869 for the use of the growing grammar 
school, provided a separate home for the boys apart 
from the theological students. The funds for its 
erection were largely contributed by Doctor George 
Shattuck, of Boston, the founder of Saint Paul’s 
School, in Concord, New Hampshire, and in his 
honour the school was presently named, its organi- 
zation as a preparatory institution practically dating 
from 1865. But the new hall was soon outgrown 
and another structure was erected for school pur- 
poses, known to-day as the Lodge, and occupied 
as a dormitory. ’ 
In 1872 the school chapel was erected by Mrs. 
Shumway, of Chicago, as a memorial of her daugh- 
ter. Although it has been called a “ beautiful and 
satisfactory example of church architecture,” the 
writer is unable to share in this flattering estimate 
of its merits. Very little American Gothic produced
-P-A-G-E-254
  242. Some Famous American Schools 
in the sixties and seventies was either beautiful or 
satisfactory, and the best that can be said of the 
chapel at Shattuck is that it is rather better than 
much contemporary work in that style. The ex- 
terior, more or less shrouded in foliage, is not un- 
attractive, from certain points of view, but the 
interior is weakly ineffective from an architectural 
standpoint, however admirably it may serve its 
ritual purpose. 
Seminary and school were now about to be more 
widely separated than before, for on the burning of 
Seabury Hall in 1872 the theological school was 
removed to another part of Faribault, and the few 
grammar school lads formerly housed there were 
now provided for in Whipple Hall, erected in 1873. 
By this time the number of pupils in the school had 
risen to one hundred, and Faribault had long since 
ceased to be a frontier settlement. 
How quickly the school fell into line in respect to 
certain modern essentials is shown by its acquire- 
ment of a gymnasium in 1880. In 1887 the great 
Shumway Hall was built from the bequest of Mrs.

Shumway, a building strikingly effective from sev- 
eral points of view, its tall massive tower being 
visible for a long distance. Connected with it by 
a many-windowed corridor is Morgan Hall, whose 
lower story is a most attractive, lofty-ceilinged 
dining-room. Adjoining Morgan Hall on the west 
is the smaller Smyser Hall, like Shumway and 
» Morgan Halls, a gift to the institution. Other 
buildings there are, attached to the institution, but 
these are the chief, though three or four more of 
considerable size are planned for in the near future. 
It is not always given to the pioneers of a move- 
ment or an institution to see movement or institu- 
tion reach an advanced stage of growth, an advance 
measured by more than the passage of a generation, 
but Bishop Whipple lived to see the small day school 
which he found at Faribault develop into the 
great and flourishing school now famous throughout 
the Middle West, while the assistant master, who 
came thither in 1866 and became the head of the 
school in the following year, the Reverend James 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  246 Some Famous American Schools 
Dobbin, still holds his place as rector, after thirty- 
five years of continuous and honourable service. 
Shattuck did not spring into active being as the 
result of munificent endowment. In the whole of 
its existence the sum total of gifts received by it is 
not over a quarter of a million, nor has it a general 
endowment at present. It is a little difficult, even 
for persons accustomed to close calculations, to per- 
ceive how Shattuck has contrived to maintain its 
high standard of efficiency for so many years, with 
what may be called its slender resources as compared 
with those of many American schools. Its buildings, 
situated in the midst of ample grounds, might do 
credit to a far wealthier institution, and the appear- 
ance of the two hundred lads within them offers 
testimony of another, but equally convincing, char- 
acter to the prosperity of Shattuck. 
Nearly two thousand boys have been trained in 
its halls, and among its graduates are a bishop and 
several deans and rectors, while the various pro- 
fessors, bankers, journalists, manufacturers, and 
other men of prominence who have been educated

here are more than may be named in these pages. 
They are found scattered through the States from 
Chicago to the Pacific, and their appearance in so 
many walks of life is an evidence that the training 
which they received at Shattuck was by no means 
one-sided in character. 
Unlike Saint Mark’s, a “ church school ” with all 
its departments under one roof, Shattuck has 
adopted, with modifications, the household system 
of which Lawrenceville offers the most complete 
example. The system in this case was a gradual 
development brought about by the necessity of pro- 
viding for a comparatively small increase in numbers 
demanding immediate provision for their accommo- 
dation, and did not spring into existence all at once 
as at Lawrenceville, when established under its 
present foundation. 
So at Shattuck, therefore, we find the school 
broken up into families or groups of varying pro- 
portions, from twelve boys to forty. There are six 
of these families housed in stone and wooden build- 
ings scattered about the school grounds, the size of 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
250 Some Famous American Schools 
the household being determined by the size of the 
house. In each case the house is in the care of a 
master who is responsible for the boys in his house- 
hold, his responsibilities in some instances being 
shared by an assistant master. Perhaps one might 
say when comparing the opposite systems pursued 
at Saint Mark’s and Shattuck that, while the first 
has its manifest conveniences, the latter has its 
manifest advantages. 
When Benjamin Franklin in 1749 sketched his 
“ Proposals relating to the education of youth in 
Pennsylvania” he was mindful to recommend the 
encouragement of sports for the physical good of 
the students, among which running, leaping, wres- 
tling, and swimming are specified. The authorities 
at Shattuck are very much of Franklin’s opinion as 
to the importance of a sound body for the habitation 
of the sound mind, and under their encouragement 
athletics flourish apace. “Teams” therefore 
abound, and in the rooms of the Shattuck boys one 
comes upon innumerable pictures of basket-ball 
teams, football teams, baseball teams, and if
-P-A-G-E-263
Shattuck School 251 
there be “teams” of other sorts these are 
there, also. One can easily imagine the approv- 
ing smile on the face of the shade of Franklin 
should it be permitted him to visit Faribault. Ample 
spaces are devoted to ball-grounds and tennis courts, 
while that last desideratum of athletic minds, a 
quarter-mile cinder-track, is also one of the joys of 
Shattuck. 
But the physical culture practised at the school 
does not end with its “‘ teams,” its tennis courts, and 
its cinder-path. It is a military school, as one does 
not need to be told, after one has caught the first 
glimpse of a Shattuck cadet. Very stern these young 
sons of Mars appear when seen on drill; preter- 
naturally so, indeed, after the manner of youth on 
such occasions, but the pose is fortunately too severe 
to be maintained for long, and at other times they 
are very much like non-military pupils elsewhere. 
But their military exercise is no mere trifling matter 
of the moment, for the cadets are put through their 
military paces by a United States army officer 
trained at West Point, and whatever else may be  
-P-A-G-E-264
252 Some Famous American Schools 
said of the training at West Point, it was never 
said that its graduates were in the least indifferent 
to matters of discipline. The muskets used are 
supplied by the government, as well as the other 
details of equipment, and both the property of the 
government and the work done is annually inspected 
by an army inspector-general, whose report is made 
to the Secretary of War. 
To lads indifferent or disinclined to military drill, 
this feature of life at Shattuck will most probably 
not seem like one that appertains to an earthly para- 
dise, but to the majority of active lads the thoughts 
of the drill, the uniform, and even of the strict 
West Pointer, will not be so very repellent. A 
battalion parade in the shadow of the great tower of 
Shumway is a very inspiriting affair in its way, and 
the average lad would much prefer to be in it than 
out of it, while as for the artillery drill, one look at 
the fellows engaged in it testifies to their enjoyment 
of the exercise. 
If the seductive cigarette or beloved pipe find wor- 
shippers here, the worship must be conducted in the

most secret fashion imaginable, for the use of to- 
bacco in any form by Shattuck boys is strictly pro- 
hibited, a provision that probably brings joy to the 
breasts of anxious mothers, although the fathers are 
possibly prone to speculate whether the rigorous 
enforcement of such a Spartan enactment should 
not be ranked with the labours of Hercules. Each 
school in the end doubtless adopts the measures 
which seem justified by experience, and Shattuck 
may have found complete prohibition practicable, — 
on the surface. A non-partisan observer, however, 
may be permitted to question whether the Lawrence- 
ville system of regulation, rather than absolute pro- 
hibition, may not produce the better results. 
Mothers who seek to make their sons’ rooms at 
school an esthetic “ dream ” by means of artistically 
disposed draperies at doors and windows, and win- 
dow-seats or alcoves overflowing with gorgeous silk 
pillows, as is the manner of certain mothers who 
desire their boys to be reminded of home, are dis- 
tinctly discouraged from engaging in such pious 
labours at Shattuck. The regulations are not Spar-
-P-A-G-E-268
  256 Some Famous American Schools 
tan, certainly, but they are uncompromisingly and 
prosaically rigid on this point, and most undeniably 
bear the impress of a masculine mind in their 
composition. 
“Rooms must not be littered up” — shades of 
eesthetes, dead and gone, listen to these unfeeling 
words — “littered up with tapestry and hangings 
that will gather dust and render the room unwhole- 
some.” 
The views of the mothers of Shattuck cadets 
upon this regulation have not, apparently, found 
public expression, but the youths themselves, though 
forbidden to “litter up” their rooms with “ tapestry 
and hangings,” do not seem to suffer materially from 
this form of privation. It is greatly to be feared 
that the fathers of Shattuck lads do not perceive 
any peculiar hardships in the situation. 
Systems of education have their day and cease to 
be, but certain school requirements remain the same 
whatever else disappears or is sent spinning down 
the ringing grooves of change. Now, as then, 
Holmes’s “ Maiden Aunt” in her school-days would
-P-A-G-E-269
  
Shattuck School 257 
be expected to bring with her to boarding-school, 
“as the rules require, six towels and a spoon,” or 
their equivalents. Shattuck lads are implored to 
bring with them “ tooth-brush, clothes-brush, Bible, 
and Prayer-book;” Nazareth boys are reminded of 
, the needful “ six towels” and “ six napkins ” also; 
while Lawrenceville demands that each pupil sur- 
round himself with vastly more impedimenta than 
either Shattuck or Nazareth, for nothing short of 
’ and various other “twelve towels, twelve napkins,’ 
details in the way of linen, will satisfy the require- 
ments of this particular school. Nothing is said as 
to the necessity of the Lawrenceville student bring- 
ing a Bible with him, probably its presence in the 
trunk of each is taken for granted, but as Lawrence- 
ville is not distinctly a “‘ church ” school, no mention 
of a prayer-book is made among the requirements 
either. On the Pacific Coast an up-to-dateness is 
expected, and we are therefore not surprised to 
learn that Belmont boys are requested to bring with 
them to school a Revised Version of the Bible, with 
“six towels and six napkins,” of course, in addition  
-P-A-G-E-270
  258 Some Famous American Schools 
to two pairs of duck trousers and other strictly 
personal requisites. 
It should be mentioned that Shattuck differs 
slightly from the majority of schools in not requir- 
ing the customary “six towels and six napkins,” 
these indispensables being supplied by the institu- 
tion, while the bringing of umbrellas is definitely 
discouraged. 
As at Saint Paul’s, Saint Mark’s, and several 
other schools described here, the Faribault institu- 
tion divides its school course into “ forms,” there be- 
ing five in all, each form corresponding to a year in 
the usual fashion. In effect there are several addi- 
tional forms out of a lower grade, for at the distance 
of a mile is a school preparatory to the larger insti- 
tution, “ The Lower School for Little Boys.” It was 
established in 1901 by the Reverend James Dobbin, 
and is intended for the accommodation of twenty 
lads between the ages of seven and twelve. Like 
their elder neighbours, the small boys of the Lower 
School wear the uniform of cadet gray, and in both 
schools the uniform is continuously worn.

Shattuck School 261 
The Shattuck School stands within the municipal 
limits of the city of Faribault, but divided from 
the main portion of it by what is called the “ Straight 
River,” and is about a mile distant from the business 
quarter of the city. Its various buildings are 
placed irregularly along a plateau which on the west 
terminates ir. a bluff nearly one hundred feet above 
the river, and toward the eastward the land rises 
yet higher. Ravines cutting into the bluff north and 
south add not a little to the picturesqueness of the 
situation. If the grounds do not exhibit the same 
finished appearance as those of Lawrenceville and 
Saint Mark’s, the natural advantages of the Minne- 
sota school are greater, and with increased endow- 
ment will come in time, no doubt, greater beauty 
of immediate surroundings. 
On the same bluff on which Shattuck is situated, 
and within a radius of two miles, are seven notable 
educational institutions, four of which are controlled 
by the Episcopal Church (the Shattuck School, Sea- 
bury Divinity School, Saint Mary’s Hall, for girls, 
and the Lower School), the other three, intended for 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
    262 Some Famous American Schools 
the deaf, blind, and feeble-minded, belonging ‘to the 
State. Not many small cities can point to so many 
schools within so limited an area as Faribault is 
thus enabled to do. 
That Saint Mary’s Hall should be in such close 
proximity to Shattuck was, perhaps, to be looked for 
in the natural order of things, for never yet was col- 
lege or boys’ school planted in any locality but within 
a period longer or shorter, and usually shorter, a 
school for girls was founded, if not in actual sight of 
the other, at least within a distance easily com- 
passed by active youth.

  Groton 
F any object which is set on a hill may be called 
] secluded, then may Groton School be thus 
described, for though its buildings crown a 
rolling ridge or down, they yet remain unperceived 
until one has arrived within a comparatively short 
“distance. At least this is the case when one ap- 
proaches from the direction of Ayer Junction. That 
thriving involuntary Mecca of most travellers 
through Northern Massachusetts having once been 
left behind, a drive of rather less than three miles 
through a pleasant bit of countryside brings one 
to the school. The ascent is continuous, though 
gradual, and when perhaps half the distance is 
passed, a richly pinnacled church tower peers over 
the down, in a very alluring English rural fashion, 
as if one were journeying through Somerset or 
Wiltshire. Presently a turn in the highway shuts 
265
-P-A-G-E-278

266 Some Famous American Schools 
it from the view, and it is not till one has gone 
considerably further that it appears in sight again. 
When the scholastic haven has been reached its 
surroundings are discovered to be those of the most 
distinctively rural character. Not even the sparsely 
peopled parish of Groton in English Suffolk, for 
which the Massachusetts town was named, and 
reached only after a six-mile drive or walk from 
Hadleigh in one direction, or one of similar length 
from Sudbury in the other, can seem more remote. 
And for the purpose which the founders of Groton 
School had in mind, perhaps this seclusion is well. 
But it is not without certain manifest disadvantages 
in the depth of a New England winter. 
To the north and west of the school the land de- 
scends in wooded slopes to the valley of the Nashua 
River,while far to the north are the rolling waves 
of the Pack Monadnock range in New Hampshire, 
and above and beyond them Grand Monadnock it- 
self. But no village or city is visible in all the wide 
prospect, and only to the eastward is there a hint 
of anything but entire seclusion from the world at
-P-A-G-E-279
  
Groton 267 
large, for in that quarter two miles away is the vil- 
lage of Groton, not wholly invisible, yet rather 
guessed at than actually seen. In apparent seclusion 
Lawrenceville resembles the Groton establishment, 
for the hamlet beside it is insignificant as regards 
size, but though five miles from Princeton in one 
direction and from Trenton in the other, two much 
patronized lines of electric railway passing near it 
effectually prevent the seclusion from becoming 
burdensome. 
But at Groton the silence is that of the open 
country, broken only by the comparatively infre- 
quent roll of wheels along the highway, the sound of 
the quarter chimes from the pinnacled chapel tower, 
and the shouting and laughing to be expected from 
one hundred and fifty boys in recreation hours. But 
seclusion is not to be hired. It pursueth him that 
flies from it and flees from who courts it. And in 
these twentieth century days of electric cars he were 
indeed a reckless prophet who should proclaim of 
any locality, however remote, that the “ broomstick 
train ” would never invade its solitude. 
   
-P-A-G-E-280
  268 Some Famous American Schools 
For long years Saint Mark’s School contentedly 
purred over its dignified exclusiveness on the outer 
edge of a farming town, where the only rude echoes 
from the outer, world were those of the occasional 
railway train on its way to Marlborough or Fra- 
mingham. And now the electric car circles through 
Southborough below the school, and two or three 
times an hour the allurements of those small cities are 
thus placed within the range of temptation for the 
sons of Saint Mark’s. Groton may similarly find 
Ayer Junction thus in effect brought to its very 
doors. And some day, without doubt, the inevitable 
school for girls will be established in sight of Groton 
and Saint Mark’s, and the usual Embargo Act be 
consequently proclaimed. 
In other words, it may well be questioned if 
scholastic seclusion is worth much conscious effort 
in the endeavour to obtain it. It has its advantages, 
of course, and it may have its disadvantages as well. 
When procurable without seeming to be sedulously 
sought, it may be an aid in carrying out the purpose 
of the school, but in the writer’s opinion the world

Groton 271 
need not be too severely shunned by the founders 
of schools. Winchester and Harrow have not done 
less good work in their long day because they were 
situated in the midst of small towns, and Eton and 
Marlborough, to name no others, are apparently not 
much hampered by their nearness to small centres 
of town life. 
At Groton, more readily than elsewhere, it is the 
architecture which first impresses itself upon the 
attention of the observer. Indeed it hardly ceases 
to dominate and compel attention so long as one 
is within its influence. There are no surprises at 
Groton due to variety of situation; the entire range 
of structures is perceived from the first, and noth- 
ing is partly screened by foliage as at Lawrence- 
ville, or discovered by changing the point of view, 
as at Saint Paul’s. Details, to be sure, reveal them- 
selves at Groton after acquaintance, but outlines 
and general effect are at once apparent. 
Architecture being then so prominently in the 
foreground at Groton it is a fortunate circumstance 
that it is of so uniformly excellent and, in one in-  
-P-A-G-E-284
  272 Some Famous American Schools 
stance, of so thoroughly satisfying a character. At 
Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, a 
building outline similarly unrelieved by foliage or 
picturesqueness of site, is equally manifest, but 
anything that can be truthfully termed architecture 
is non-existent in the latter instance. 
As at Lawrenceville, the buildings at Groton are 
ranged at intervals around a wide, circular expanse 
of level lawn, those in which the domestic life of 
the school is carried on differing in general charac- 
ter from gymnasium and school, as both differ widely 
from the crowning feature of all, the chapel. To 
the south is the long range of the Hundred House, 
so called because the abode of one hundred boys, and 
opposite it, on the north side of the lawn, is the 
older Brooks House, named in honour of Bishop 
Phillips Brooks. The feature of the west side is the 
School House, while on the east are the great gym- 
nasitum and the noble school chapel. 
Perhaps one would not call the long curving 
facade of the Hundred House beautiful, but its ir- 
regularities of outline and its varieties of roof are

-P-A-G-E-286

-P-A-G-E-287
Groton 275 
wonderfully picturesque, while the building as a 
whole is an excellent example of the intelligently 
treated so-called colonial style. It is of deep red 
brick, and its western end is the residence of the head 
master, the Reverend Endicott Peabody. The range 
of long windows seen near the other end are those of 
the great dining-hall of the House, architecturally ef- 
fective in its interior, but, with its long tables, quite 
wanting in the homelike, social aspect which attracts 
one in the dining-hall at Andover, for example, 
with its many small tables, or in the pleasant dining- 
room of the Upper House of Lawrenceville, which 
is similarly furnished. In the deep bay-window of 
the Hundred House, and raised a step above the rest 
of the apartment, is the table at which are seated 
the head master and the prefects, possibly a wise 
arrangement from a disciplinary point of view, but 
effectually checking any effervescence of spirits on 
the part of those thus overlooked by the eye of 
authority. At the extreme west end of the Hundred 
House is the spacious and altogether delightful 
library of the head master, where on especial occa-
-P-A-G-E-288
276 Some Famous American Schools 
sions the entire school can be gathered for familiar 
talks from the masters. 
Brooks House, the only other school dormitory, is 
a smaller structure, in essentials, however, like the 
Hundred House, and, if less ambitious in point of 
art, is still very pleasing to the eye. “A certain 
number of masters are assigned to each house and 
are responsible for the preservation of order therein. 
A few of the masters, however, reside in houses of 
their own apart from the other school buildings. 
From the foregoing it will be seen that Groton 
has adopted the house system, though with impor- 
tant differences from Lawrenceville, since here the 
entire school are gathered in two houses, and of 
course the internal management at the two schools 
must therefore vary. 
The School House, an immense building with a 
central portion and two wings, displays much evi- 
dence of thoughtful care in the treatment of its 
extensive fagade, but the effect is not in all respects 
pleasing, a result due to the circumstance that the 
walls of the central portion are much lower than

-P-A-G-E-291
  Groton 279 
those of the flanking wings, while its dormers and 
cupola do but very little emphasize the importance 
of the centre as such. 
Once within the edifice, its immense size cannot 
fail to impress the beholder. One might almost be 
tempted to declare that there were acres of corridors 
and lobbies. Indeed one would perhaps exclaim at 
the amount of room thus needlessly sacrificed in 
creating these lordly corridors did there not appear 
to be abundance of room everywhere else. The beau- 
tiful study hall whose seven long windows look 
out upon the school lawn is a memorial to one of 
Groton’s graduates, George Zabriskie Gray, who 
died in 1898, and whose father was for many years 
the dean of the Episcopal Theological School in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, a fair young life, too 
early closed. 
Ample as the building appears to be, it is so con- 
structed as to be readily extended in the future in 
accordance with the original design, though why 
extension should ever become necessary, while the
-P-A-G-E-292
  280 Some Famous American Schools 
institution has no wish to add to the number of 
pupils, is not quite easy to see. 
The newest structure at Groton is the gymnasium, 
completed only very recently and towering high 
above the former gymnasium, soon to be removed. 
Like the similar new buildings at Andover and 
Lawrenceville, it appears to want for little in the 
way of athletic equipment, and those who disport 
therein probably concern themselves not at all as 
to its architectural merits. Merits of this class it 
has, apparent in the matter of proportion, but the 
entrance hardly seems adequately impressive for 
so large a structure, and the pale red colour of the 
outer walls is more or less repellent in effect. Time 
may soften this aspect somewhat, but at present the 
gymnasium seems to glare al! too fiercely at its vis-a- 
vis across the lawn, the School House, which with 
its gleaming white porticoes, cupola, and window 
dressings, returns the stare with interest. 
The earlier gymnasium has played a prominent 
part in the school life, as its successor is destined to 
do, for athletics have been encouraged from the first

Groton 283 
at Groton, and football, baseball, and rowing were 
the three sports most enthusiastically pursued at the 
beginning. In those early days of the school’s his- 
tory, it had but a single boat upon the bosom of the 
neighbouring Nashua, where now there is a perfect 
flotilla of canoes and four-oared craft. And of 
tennis courts, golf links, and fives courts there is 
no lack. 
Organized athletics are firmly believed in at 
Groton, and the lads quickly learn in these things 
to conceal personal preferences in furtherance of 
the success of the school as such. Hockey, skating, 
skiing, and fives are the winter sports here, and 
double-runners, skates, and hockey-sticks are not 
merely esteemed as luxuries, but become the indis- 
pensable necessities of juvenile existence when the 
mercury goes down. But the pursuit of these par- 
ticular joys is not suffered to interfere with regular 
gymnasium practice, for in the late afternoon the 
entire school is summoned to the gymnasium for 
regular gymnastic exercise. The Groton boy may 
not like this exercise when considered in the light 
   
-P-A-G-E-296
  284 Some Famous American Schools 
of daily duty, but, willy-nilly, he goes to it, and in 
this manner a certain amount of definite, vigorous 
exercise is insured him every day. 
The distinguishing detail at this school, in ma- 
turer eyes, if not in juvenile ones, is the chapel, the 
gift of William Amory Gardner, and the design of 
the architect, Henry Vaughan, the same who built 
the beautiful chapel at Saint Paul’s. Its outline 
comprises a nave of five bays and a choir of two, a 
tall, pinnacled tower on the north with its western 
face forming a portion of the western front of the 
building, an organ chamber, and a narrow north 
aisle serving merely as an ambulatory. The tower is 
in four stages, the two lowermost being plain, thus 
carrying the gaze upward to the others, which are 
richly panelled. The period chosen is that of the 
Curvilinear half of the Middle Pointed style often 
called the Late Decorated, but so far along in the 
style that its transition to the Third Pointed, or 
Perpendicular, is already manifesting itself. The 
tower, indeed, with its pinnacled upper stage of the 
Bristol type of Somerset towers, seems to indicate

that the transition has already been made. Stone of 
a greyish-white is the material employed, and when 
this has taken on a little of the aspect imparted by 
age and weather the effect will be even more satis- 
fying than at present. 
The interior is most dignified, the actual height 
seeming yet greater from the presence of the rows 
of vaulting shafts and the comparative narrowness 
of the nave and choir. The ceiling is an open tim- 
bered one of dark wood, its colour emphasized by 
the whiteness of the stone walls, and the nave arches 
are filled with carved and canopied stalls. High 
above the stalls on the north side of the choir is the 
organ. Rush bottom chairs, as in an English cathe- 
dral, occupy the floor of the nave. 
The Groton chapel is not only the finest school 
chapel in the United States, but it is one of the best 
specimens of modern Pointed or Gothic to be found 
here, either. A copy of medieval work? Yes, 
for modern Gothic must of necessity be a copy, but 
it is in no sense a servile imitation. On the contrary, 
it is an intelligent rendering of medieval design  
-P-A-G-E-300
  288 Some Famous American Schools 
with not a little of originality in the matter of 
treatment, and the more of this intelligent copying 
we have in this country the better, if such admirable 
results are produced as at Groton. 
As an aid to the religious life of an educational 
institution, the influence of a chapel of this high 
architectural character can scarcely be overestimated. 
Boys are affected by an atmosphere, though usually 
unconsciously, and if the atmosphere be of an 
inspiring nature, results will be commensurate. 
That the boys at this school are overchurched 
seems as unlikely as that the lads at Saint Paul’s 
are similarly afflicted. Matins and evensong in the 
chapel on Sunday, neither a long service, the first 
named with a sermon; and on week-days ten-minute 
prayers just prior to recitations and immediately 
after supper. Surely if a school is to have religious 
exercises at all, here are not too many. The plant 
called reverence needs watering fairly often in order 
to thrive apace, and if there are those who object to 
expose their offspring to these frequent though 
brief waterings, there are schools, like the Middle- ma ee

sex School at Concord, Massachusetts, which for 
the present dispense with formal religious exercises. 
The point, however, which is sought to be made 
here, is that at such distinctively “ church schools” 
as Groton and Saint Paul’s, ritual is not made 
burdensome to the boys, nor religion suffered to 
make their pleasures measurably less. 
In this matter things have changed within a 
generation in Episcopal institutions, as they have in 
secular academies. The writer recalls memories of 
a small “church” boarding-school with which he 
once had relations where Monday was made purga- 
torial by the requirement of a verbatim recital of 
the Sunday’s collect, from each pupil, and that of 
the nearest saint’s day or other holy day, also, and 
in case of a vacation a further recital of all the 
collects which had accumulated during that interval. 
And as collects appeared to multiply almost at the 
rate of geometrical progression during the long or 
summer vacation, September, thesefore, was as dole- 
ful a month to the youthful pilgrim returning to

  292 Some Famous American Schools 
“ scholastic shades as is “the long dull time of the 
Ramadan” to the follower of Mahomet. 
Like other preparatory schools, Groton aims to 
fit its pupils for successfully passing college exami- 
nations. Probably no school authorities would de- 
clare that the purpose of the institution under their 
charge ended at just that point. Yet in the nature 
of things, that must be the end, practically speaking, 
in many instances. The crowding interests, the 
increasing requirements, the want of time, — these 
and other things make anything else difficult if 
not almost impossible in schools where authority 
cannot be exerted at all times, or in others whose 
existence is dependent upon financial success, and 
this in turn dependent upon the number of pupils 
attracted on account of a reputation for successfully 
fitting boys to pass a college entrance examination. 
At Groton, and doubtless at Saint Paul’s and 
other schools herein named, examination passing is 
considered incidental rather than as a main purpose. 
Definite principles of action, high ideals of life, 
these are the real aims of education, and Groton 
o
-P-A-G-E-305
Groton 293 
has very distinctly placed them before the strictly 
utilitarian one of preparation for college entrance 
examination. 
In pursuance of this idea she has endeavoured to 
steer a course between the complete following out of 
the loco parentis plan as at Nazareth, and the oppo- 
site one of allowing large freedom, such as one finds 
at Andover and Exeter. Self-reliance, she deems, 
may be bought too dearly, while on the other hand, 
the loco parentis theory too strictly applied may pro- 
long the period of dependence beyond a legitimate 
period. 
Accordingly, while we find the house system at 
Groton as at Lawrenceville, it is with very serious 
modifications. Its two houses, the Hundred and 
Brooks, are with their larger numbers necessarily 
controlled in a different fashion from the less popu- 
lous masters’ houses at Lawrenceville. The Upper 
House board of directors at the latter school finds 
to some extent its counterpart at Groton in the seven 
school prefects, chosen from the sixth form, but not 
only do the prefects exercise a measure of authority 
   
-P-A-G-E-306
  294 Some Famous American Schools 
beyond that of the Lawrenceville directors, but the 
entire sixth form are likewise accorded the exercise 
of a certain amount of authority. This system cer- 
tainly has the advantage of lessening the load of the 
masters, and no doubt was adopted with the idea 
of infusing into the older pupils a sense of responsi- 
bility, and of obtaining their aid in securing the 
best interests of the school. 
That, we may assume, is the underlying theory of 
the arrangement, and some persons may detect in the 
prefect system the shadow of the English monitorial 
scheme. It has no doubt worked well at times, and 
a boy of naturally high principles will be strength- 
ened by the exercise of his duties as prefect, but it 
is no light thing to place the average boy in a position 
of authority over others younger than himself, and 
if the prefect system has worked well at Groton, it 
is in spite of its inherent weakness, and by reason 
of especial care on the part of the faculty. That 
it is, as some persons would say, “ un-American,” is 
nothing against it in itself. If a method be good 
and commend itself to unbiassed judgment, by all
-P-A-G-E-307
  
Groton 295 
means let it be adopted, no matter how unusual it 
may appear in American eyes. Nor can reasonable 
objection be urged against the testing of this or that 
system about whose ultimate workings one is not 
fully assured. 
But the prefect system in one form or another has 
been tried for generations in England and else- 
where, and both its merits and demerits have there 
the sanctity that attaches to long usage. That the 
latter are outweighed by the former is by no means 
an established fact, but ancient customs are not 
easily altered, and we should not expect to see Win- 
chester therefore materially changing her practice 
in this regard, no matter what the defects in it may 
be. In America, however, the conditions are vastly 
different. The bonds of custom are slighter; the 
mental attitude of the schoolboy not at all that of his 
English cousin in many things. 
The English schoolboy expects to be commanded 
by those above him not only socially, but as regards 
school rank. The American schoolboy expects to 
obey a head master and his staff; he not only does  
-P-A-G-E-308
  296 Some Famous American Schools 
not expect to obey another schoolboy, but he in- 
stinctively rebels at having another schoolboy set 
over him in a position of authority. All this may 
be exceedingly misjudged on his part, but it is 
something to be reckoned with, and the difference 
in the attitudes of the American and English school- 
boys can hardly be left out of the question by heads 
of schools who are considering this feature of Eng- 
lish education. 
By those who dissent from this position it will 
be urged that American lads readily obey the orders 
of the captains of their various athletic teams, the 
directors of their various juvenile societies, the offi- 
cers of their military companies, and the like. All 
of which is true enough. But the workings of other 
impelling forces are here discoverable. Military 
discipline instinctively appeals to most active lads. 
They recognize that nothing can be accomplished in 
this direction without obedience, and the attractions 
of the uniform and the muskets and swords out- 
weigh the inconveniences of the situation. In very 
many other juvenile organizations the officers are
-P-A-G-E-309
Groton 207 
chosen by the boys themselves, not set over them 
by an outside power, and when class or school loy- 
alty and enthusiasm are awakened the orders of the 
captain of a team are complied with without a 
thought to the contrary. 
Disregarding, therefore, what seems to many a 
radical difference between English and American 
lads, Groton has adopted the prefect system, and 
owing to the personality of the heads of the school, 
no doubt unconsciously exerted oftentimes, it has 
not materially hindered the prosperity of the estab- 
lishment. That it has been for the school’s best 
interest, nevertheless, one would hesitate to assert. 
It was not adopted merely from a desire to imitate 
an old English custom, but with the intention of 
introducing into the school management whatever 
features should seem most admirable. It at all 
events gives individuality to Groton, and as an edu- 
cational experiment in American school government 
is worthy of careful, dispassionate attention, on the 
part of those who hold other theories. 
One hears more or less discussion regarding the 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
Shhh wikia: 
298 Some Famous American Schools 
dormitory arrangements presented at different 
schools, and whether the cubicle or separate room 
principle be the better. Upon that particular burn- 
ing topic the writer cannot venture to hazard an 
opinion. Andover and Exeter most unhesitatingly 
condemn. in practice the cubicle or alcove system, and 
so at those institutions we find such arrangements as 
prevail at Harvard or other university dormitories: 
the common study for two, with wide bedroom; the 
common study with two small bedrooms; or the 
single room for one person only. Lawrenceville, 
also, avoids the cubicle. Saint Paul’s, on the con- 
trary, adopts the cubicle system for its new Lower 
School, where the younger boys are domiciled. At 
Groton the cubicle plan is followed both in the Hun- 
dred House and Brooks House, and this particular 
domestic feature has its strenuous advocates in more 
recently organized institutions, still, for the very 
new Middlesex School at Concord, Massachusetts, 
has its cubicles, likewise. 
Where this system is in vogue, it follows, of 
course, that the sense of personal ownership attach-

ing to a boy’s own room at school is thus reduced 
to its lowest terms, and the heterogeneous array of 
objects more or less decorative in their nature which 
cover the walls of such apartments finds no counter- 
part in the contracted cubicle or sleeping closet. At 
Groton the boys of the two upper forms are pro- 
vided with studies, while the remaining forms 
study at desks in the schoolrooms of the two houses. 
Groton School was opened on October fifteen, 
1884, with twenty-four boys and three masters, and 
the head master of that day, the Reverend Endicott 
Peabody, fortunately remains at the head still. 
Fortunately, because opportunity has thus been af- 
forded for carrying out for a relatively long period, 
under one guiding hand, the particular aims with 
which the institution was established, and because, 
also, of the subtle but no less potent influence exerted 
by the abiding presence through a long series of 
years of a personality at once as winsome as it is 
forcible. The first president of the board of trus- 
tees was the Reverend Phillips Brooks, whose inter- 
est in the school remained warm and vital till the
-P-A-G-E-314
  302 Some Famous American Schools 
close of his life, and who was succeeded by the Right 
Reverend William Lawrence, the Bishop of Massa- 
chusetts. 
Says Mr. William Amory Gardner, writing of 
that early period in the school’s history: 
“No one had much experience, and in consequence 
the school began, unhampered by prejudice, to build 
up its own traditions. Manners and customs which 
prevail to-day, and which give the place its peculiar 
flavour, can be directly traced to the happenings of 
the first year. The school was particularly fortunate 
in the boys of that day, for they made possible the 
simple and familiar relation which has ever since 
existed between master and pupil. All took part in 
the same sports, and the relation was exactly like 
that between older and younger brothers, without a 
trace of the traditional opposition between govern- 
ment and governed. In sports like skating and 
coasting the whole school went forth ina body. This 
produced a spirit of unity, which even now is in- 
tensely vital, though of course greatly modified by 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
     Groton 303, 
the necessary subdivision of organization which the 
increased size of the school has brought about.” 
A feature of Groton life concerning which a word 
may be said is a Missionary Society, which, in addi- 
tion to holding religious services in various locali- 
ties in the surrounding district, is largely interested 
in the work of the Boys’ Club in Boston, directed 
by the clergy of Saint Stephen’s Church. Groton 
men in Harvard at regular intervals entertain the 
boys of the club for an evening, and the Missionary 
Society assumes the responsibility for the club’s 
expenses. A still more important work of the so- 
ciety is its management of a summer camp situated 
on an island in Lake Asquam, New Hampshire. 
Parties of twenty-five or thirty boys from Boston or 
New York are taken there for a fortnight’s pleasur- 
ing under the care of a management varying in com- 
position from one week to another, yet always com- 
prising a master from Groton, two or three gradu- 
ates, and several of the sixth form boys. The bene- 
fits of such an intercourse are reciprocal, but perhaps 
are of greater moment to the lads whose outward 
    
-P-A-G-E-316

advantages in life have been many, than even to 
those whose lives have lacked these things. * 
One can readily apprehend the charms of school 
existence at Groton, for if the path to knowledge has 
its pains, as every schoolboy is eager to testify, it 
has also its pleasures, and since the setting up of 
so many temples in these latter days where Apollo 
may be said to be worshipped as the patron of 
physical culture, the thorns and shards along the 
way are gladly endured for the modern compensa- 
tions thereof. One comes to see how, with a school 
no larger than is this one, an intense feeling of 
school loyalty should spring up. One gladly recog- 
nizes the beneficent influence of personal devotion 
to their work, on the part of the masters, the effect 
exerted unconsciously to themselves upon the minds 
of these young lads by the constant presence of so 
much beauty and order as are here. But one does 
not go away with the feeling that here is being solved 
in the best way possible the problem of secondary 
American education. 
“ Should you send your boy to Groton, if you had 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  Groton 305 
one?” asked one friend of another, after a visit to 
Groton, in the course of which they had seen and 
been delighted with much. 
“Not if I wanted to make a live American of 
him,” was the reply. 
“ The hysterical, my-country-right-or-wrong kind, 
I presume you mean?” 
“Not at all,” said the other. “ But perhaps I 
should have said loyal American. The kind of 
American we used at one time to hear more about 
than now, whose ideals were ‘ plain living and high 
thinking,’ and who was supremely indifferent to 
considerations of wealth or social prestige as set 
against native worth. No doubt it is the type I 
speak of which they aim to produce at Groton, but 
conditions are too strong for them. Rightly or 
wrongly, the school has a widespread reputation for 
being exclusive. Look at the waiting entrance-list 
that was shown us just now. There are names of 
candidates entered on the very day of their birth, 
and the struggle to place one’s boy here, with no 
higher motive now and then than the consequent  
-P-A-G-E-318
  306 Some Famous American Schools 
ability to declare that, ‘I have a son at Groton,’ bids 
fair to equal one day the strenuousness of the efforts 
of the nouveaux riche to become enrolled among the 
Four Hundred. The prevalence of a spirit like this 
outside the school must inevitably make itself felt 
within it; an atmosphere is thus unconsciously 
created. I felt it to-day, and so, no doubt, did you. 
It is an un-American atmosphere, or perhaps I 
should rather say a new-American one.” 
“Not very easy to define its limits, I should say.” 
“No, I could not tell specifically how the impres- 
sion was received from what we have seen to-day, 
unless in the matter of the waiting-list, and that. 
accounts for but little of the force of the impression, 
but it was intensified the longer we were there, and 
is not likely to be soon dispelled.” 
“Tt is just possible that you may be mistaken in 
your conclusions, you know.” 
“ Yes, I know,” but at that moment the road began 
to descend a slope, the pinnacled tower of Groton 
slowly slipped from sight, and no more was said.

T the distance of some twenty-five miles south 
A of San Francisco, on the lower slope of foot- 
hills encircling an open valley facing the Bay 
of San Francisco, one comes upon the most impor- 
tant of the preparatory schools of the Pacific Coast, 
the Belmont School, so named from its proximity 
to the small village of Belmont, a little more than a 
mile distant. Without appearing to have anxiously 
sought seclusion for the institution, as the founders 
of Groton seem to have done in the case of that 
noted foundation, seclusion sufficient for its pur- 
pose the founder of Belmont has secured, while at 
the same time accessibility, and the advantages ap- 
pertaining to comfortable nearness to a great city, 
have not been left out of the question. Within the 
distance of a few miles north and south are the 
small towns of San Mateo and Palo Alto, the latter 
309 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
  310 Some Famous American Schools 
the seat of the Leland Stanford University, while 
twelve miles to westward is the Pacific. 
The scenery, though not especially striking, is 
sufficiently varied to offer prospects that are both 
picturesque and beautiful, and if the hills behind 
the school are climbed, there is spread before the 
observer a panorama including the broad bay of 
San Francisco, the Santa Clara Valley, Mounts 
Diabolo and Tamalpais, and the Contra Costa Hills. 
All about lies a countryside admirably adapted for 
rambling pleasures. Shut in among the hills to the 
west lie the Spring Valley Lakes, pleasing, river-like 
stretches of water quite within an easy walk from 
the school, and the thirty-five acres which comprise 
the school grounds, with their groves of live-oaks 
and other trees, and their irregularities of surface, 
render the immediate surroundings attractive both 
to eye and foot. 
The history of Belmont School is a short one. It 
was founded on the fifth of August, 1885, by Mr. 
W. T. Reid, who had retired from the presidency 
of the University of California not long before.

In May of 1893 the Hopkins School was merged 
with it, and the enlarged institution was then known 
as the “ Belmont School, W. T. Reid Foundation,” 
a cumbersome title for daily use, and mercifully 
shortened to Belmont School. Its head master has 
been from the first its founder, Mr. Reid. While 
the school has passed through successive stages of 
growth in its nearly twenty years of existence, 
its six principal buildings were for the most part 
contemplated at the start, and planned therefore 
for school uses with extended acquaintance of school 
buildings elsewhere. 
The house system, which at Lawrenceville finds 
its fullest American development, appears at Bel- 
mont in a modified form, but with the home feeling 
that is so marked a characteristic of the New Jersey 
school, equally evident in the California institution. 
A small stream, whose winding course through 
the ground is defined by a fringe of laurels and live- 
oaks, separates into two groups the buildings at 
Belmont. To the south of this are to be seen the 
Head Master’s House, the School House, the Gym-
-P-A-G-E-326
  
314 Some Famous American Schools 
nasium, with certain domestic structures such as the 
laundry, power-house, and dairy. “The House,” 
as the head master’s house is most commonly styled, 
is the central factor in the family life of Belmont. 
It is a very large, irregularly shaped structure, with 
small pretensions as to architecture, but looking 
vastly comfortable, nevertheless. It contains the 
three spacious dining-rooms in which the entire 
school gather for meals. Twenty large windows, 
among which are two bay-windows, light the rooms, 
and the nine tables are each officered, as one may 
say, by one or more of the masters. Except in the 
ball season, when the teams sit together, the boys are 
arranged by classes. 
To many persons one important drawback to the 
occupancy of these cheerful dining-rooms would be 
found in the circumstance that the breakfast hour 
is at 6.30, but possibly the California constitution 
takes more kindly to early rising than is the case 
elsewhere in the civilized world. At the morning 
recess the House is again an object of general inter- 
est, for the post has arrived by this time, and the
-P-A-G-E-327
 
-P-A-G-E-328

boys are permitted to come hither for their letters, 
and, a refinement of scholastic existence whose intro- 
duction into other schools would doubtless be 
viewed with complacent fortitude, for slices of hot 
toast should they desire them. 
In the House some twenty of the youngest boys 
are lodged under the general oversight of the head 
master and his wife, and the more particular care 
of a house mistress, who is in effect a house mother, 
attending to their welfare in a hundred ways, and 
seeing them tucked into bed, so to speak, at half- 
past eight. The House contains a reading-room for 
students’ use and a miscellaneous reading and refer- 
ence library of eight hundred books. A memorial 
fund commemorating an instructor who died in 
1898, and known as the Harry Hill Library Fund, 
provides for a yearly increase to the library. 
A covered porch at the rear of the House connects 
with the School House, whose lower floor is devoted 
to recitation-rooms, and its two upper ones to 
dormitory purposes. Its windows open into a live- 
oak grove that must seem especially enticing when 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
  318 Some Famous American Schools 
classics and mathematics are beginning to weigh 
heavily upon juvenile spirits as they have a fashion 
of doing at even the most paradisiacal of educa- 
tional institutions. A master and his wife are in 
charge of this building likewise. 
Near at hand, and still on the south side of the 
stream, is the Gymnasium, one hundred feet by sev- 
enty-four, with running track, armory, fencing- 
room, shower rooms, corridors for handball, and all 
the rest of it. Athletics flourish apace at Belmont, 
baseball and football being the games that arouse 
the most general interest, and at certain seasons there 
have been four nines on the field at one time, inter- 
class games being frequent. Not until 1894 did 
football begin at Belmont, but in that year the par- 
ents of eleven boys, flinging caution and prudence 
to the winds, consented to permit their offspring to 
brave the perils of the game, and since then foot- 
ball has never wanted for enthusiastic devotees at 
Belmont. Tennis courts there are, for the use and 
behoof of two tennis clubs, nor do the sports of 
Belmont youth end here, the climate lending itself
-P-A-G-E-331
  Belmont School 319 
in most accommodating fashion to out-of-door 
amusements every week of the year. 
Several rustic bridges span the school brook, and 
crossing any of these one reaches the group of 
buildings in this quarter of the grounds. There 
are three of them, ranged around three sides of 
a quadrangle opening to the south, the area between 
them being called Palm Court. One of these, Sierra 
Hall, was built when the growing institution could 
no longer be accommodated in the structures across 
the brook. Seniors and upper middlers, by which 
uneuphonious title a certain section of the school 
is distinguished from the rest, occupy this hall, which 
has a master in charge, and contains twenty-five bed- 
rooms, several parlours, and a reading-room with a 
small library. 
On the opposite side of Palm Court, and parallel 
with Sierra Hall, is Moses Hopkins Hall, the new- 
est dormitory of all, in plan a replica of its com- 
panion, but a story higher. Lower middlers dwell 
here, and several of the masters, this plethora of 
masters possibly indicating that lower middlers are
-P-A-G-E-332
  320 Some Famous American Schools 
| 
more effervescent in their nature than upper ones. 
In this hall, too, an attractive room is always kept 
in readiness for visiting alumni. 
Covered corridors connect these two halls with a 
central structure, eventually to become the dining- 
room of the Upper School, but now serving both as 
chapel and assembly-room. It is a spacious apart- 
ment, not unattractive, but much better fitted for 
secular purposes than for devotional ones. It is 
this absence of a distinctive chapel building which 
constitutes a weak point at both Exeter and Bel- 
mont. The latter contemplates, it is believed, the 
erection of a school chapel at some time in the fu- 
ture, but Exeter has not apparently its thoughts that 
way toward. It is the testimony of observers at 
Lawrenceville that the erection of a dignified, 
churchly chapel there has been followed by a gain 
both in outward decorum and in religious feeling, 
and no doubt Belmont, when it secures for itself 
a school chapel that shall be devoted to religious pur- 
poses solely, and that shall be at the same time archi-

tecturally beautiful, will experience a similar gain 
in tone. 
In the present Belmont chapel services are held 
each Sunday noon, conducted by the head master, or 
one of the other masters, at which the students in 
a body are required to be present in their uniform. 
There is a choir made up of the younger boys, and 
this service is prefaced by Bible classes held earlier 
“in the morning. The school is not under the control 
of any denomination, but is none the less distinct- 
ively Christian in its ideal and its spirit. It must 
be said, however, that to the impartial observer, the 
tale of religious observances at Belmont seems a lit- 
tle jejune and brown coloured, and that a liturgical 
service in which the boys themselves took an inter- 
ested part were preferable to the present arrange- 
ment. Where ritual is not suffered to become bur- 
densome it is enjoyed by most boys, and the stateli- 
ness of a brief liturgical service with rolling music 
and spirited singing is not unappreciated by them. 
Like Nazareth and Shattuck, the Belmont School 
is a military institution in the sense of haying mili-
-P-A-G-E-336
  324 Some Famous American Schools 
tary drill as a part of its system, but, unlike the 
two others, its discipline is non-military. The drill 
is considered to promote order and obedience, as well 
as manly carriage of the body, and is, therefore, 
required of all the pupils over twelve years old. 
But the dark blue uniform of Belmont need only 
be worn at dinner, chapel, and at the various school 
entertainments, and the order of the day does not 
include reveille, tattoo, and taps, in its nomencla- 
ture, although getting up and going to bed are as 
regular features of school routine here as anywhere 
else. 
The school forms a battalion of two companies 
which are drilled three times a week under a mili- 
tary instructor, and the appointments to the posi- 
tions of commissioned and non-commissioned offi- 
cers under him are conditioned upon both character 
and scholarship. An inducement to excel in these 
particulars is thus offered which is not without its 
due effect, since the boy does not live who would 
not be an officer in a school military company if 
the honour were possible. In place of the drill on

  Belmont School 327 
two days of the week there are class exercises in 
the gymnasium, escape from which is no more 
possible than at Groton. 
Two of Belmont’s sons, whose first taste of mili- 
tary life was had here, have distinguished them- 
selves in the campaign in the Philippines, and two 
others went to Cuba in 1898 in the company of 
Rough Riders. Stanley Hollister, one of these, was 
wounded several times during the famous charge up 
San Juan Hill, on the second of July, and though he 
recovered from his wounds, it was only to die of 
fever a little later in a military hospital at Fortress 
Monroe. It is in contemplation by the alumni to 
place a memorial window to him in the chapel at 
Belmont, whenever it shall be built. 
School life on its scholastic side is in essentials 
very much at Belmont what it is elsewhere. School 
work is planned with reference to college entrance 
requirements, but since these requirements are in 
themselves an excellent basis for an elementary 
education, the parents of boys who are not expected 
to enter college are advised to have their sons pre-
-P-A-G-E-340
  328 Some Famous American Schools 
pare for college or scientific school. Where literary 
or scholarly tastes have manifested themselves the 
boy is counselled to pursue a regular classical course, 
with the addition of German or French. 
Rules are not manifold at Belmont, and become 
apparent only where the sense of duty in any indi- 
vidual appears somewhat weak. And so far as 
appearances go, the absence of rigidly formulated 
rules has worked well. On a few points, however, 
the law has been laid down in a most uncompromis- 
ing fashion. As at Nazareth and Shattuck, smok- 
ing, if not considered as one of the seven deadly sins, 
is as strenuously prohibited as if it were, while any 
boy who has been known to even enter a saloon is at 
once dismissed from the school. In these particu- 
lars the regulations at Belmont would commend 
themselves to even the strictest members of the W. 
C. T. U. An equally stringent prohibition is that 
against the playing games for money, or any other 
stake, a wise measure, as every one must feel. 
Saturday is doubtless the favourite day of the 
week at Belmont, except with lads of the Sandford

and Merton type, if there be any such priggish 
young persons in these days, since all the regular ex- 
ercises are then suspended, and the boys whose 
friends have not selected the day for visiting them 
are free for all sorts of juvenile delights, from camp- 
ing out for the day among the hills to candy-pulls 
and masquerades in the evenings. Sometimes, even, 
a house-party has been given, at which the sisters 
and other friends of the students have dawned upon 
the scene, and thus made dancing possible in the 
evening. The early masters of Exeter and Andover 
would probably have regarded these diversions in 
the light of thorns crackling under the pot, but a 
century has not slipped away for nothing since the 
day of the “great Eliphalet.” 
Like Harvard, the alma mater of the head master, 
the school has a Class Day, the particular Saturday 
in May when it gives its annual reception to the 
graduating class. It is in effect a lawn-party, en- 
livened by a battalion dress parade, followed by 
dancing in the great gymnasium in the afternoon. 
And of all this that wisely tolerant genius of the

eighteenth century, Benjamin Franklin, would 
assuredly approve, though the most of his contempo- 
raries might frown. 
The literary organ of the school is The Cricket, 
whose lively chirpings were for some years heard 
weekly, but now only monthly. Of clubs there are 
perhaps fewer than in some other schools, but the 
Camera Club and the Glee Club are very much to 
the fore, and mandolin, banjo, and guitar have 
each their devotees. The especial song of the school 
is “‘ Fair Belmont,” sung to the tune of “ Fair Har- 
vard,” and the words of which are as follows: 
“FAIR BELMONT 
“ Tune ‘ Fair Harvard’ 
“Fair Belmont! We gather in gladness to pay 
At thy shrine, our full homage of praise, 
For the hope and the promise so sturdily given 
That we, too, may find in our lives 
Full scope for our talent, whatever it be, 
If conscience and faithfulness guide — 
We gather together our plight to renew, 
Inspiration anew to regain. 
« And while we renew old acquaintanceship dear, 
And recall again scenes of the past,
-P-A-G-E-343
  
Belmont School B31 
May memories beautiful so fill our thoughts 
As to drive away memories ill, 
Refreshing our spirits and warming our hearts 
With the zeal of the years that are gone, 
As the sweet warmth of summer melts winter’s cold breath, 
Bringing with it new beauty and life. 
« And as we look forward to years full of strife, 
May we live with the purposeful thought, 
That no lines on our mother’s fair face shall be drawn 
By a record unworthy her name. 
And may we, too, carry this lesson of life 
As our good mother’s heritage dear, 
That in the fierce struggle for truth and for right 
We must know neither shrinking nor fear.” 
As a literary production it is open to the slight 
objection that, though apparently intended from its 
arrangement for verse, the writer of the song has 
nevertheless not troubled himself to find a rhyme till 
the closing stanza has been reached, when he rounds 
proudly to a finish with “dear” and “ fear.” But 
in respect to literary criticism of school songs, it 
surely were to consider too curiously to consider so. 
” The future of Belmont would seem to be assured. 
It possesses many advantages of site and immediate 
surroundings, its management is animated by a pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  332 Some Famous American Schools 
gressive spirit, and the homelike atmosphere of the 
school must make an increasing appeal to parents 
and students alike. While its present system re- 
mains in force it can hardly fail to increase in num- 
bers and influence as the years go on, and every 
twelvemonth of continued existence adds to its possi- 
bilities. It already holds the first place among the 
preparatory schools west of the Rocky Mountains, 
and as the neighbouring universities wax strong with 
years, the scope of Belmont as tributary to them will 
be recognized as fully as are now the similar rela- 
tions of Lawrenceville, Exeter, and Andover, to 
Princeton, Harvard, and Yale.

HE nine preparatory schools whose character- 
istics have been lightly touched upon rather 
than described within the foregoing pages, 
have their distinctive features, as we have seen. 
Alike in their general aim, they differ among them- 
selves in respect to theories of management and the 
like, even more widely than do their English pro- 
totypes of Eton, Harrow, and Rugby. Each has 
its attractions, as it has its loyal defenders among 
alumni and undergraduates. The impartial ob- 
server will assuredly find much to approve and ad- 
mire in every case, and if moved to criticism of this 
or that feature in any one of the nine, will, assuredly, 
criticize in no unfriendly fashion. Such criticisms, 
indeed, as have been ventured upon here and there 
in the preceding chapters have been uttered in a 
335
-P-A-G-E-348
336 Some Famous American Schools 
spirit of entire good nature, and if mistakenly made 
must share the fate of such mistakes. And now, 
as the end is reached, a last word may be added, 
regarding a phase of the educational problem that 
these institutions are doing their conscientious best 
to solve, 
When one has visited them all, and especially 
when one has noted at the same time the amounts 
annually required to maintain a boy at any of these 
institutions where, in Calverley’s phrase, “are 
blended home comforts with school training,” a 
question springs to mind that is not easily answered. 
At all but one of the nine schools here mentioned 
this sum amounts to not less than $600, and in 
the majority of instances to $700, and, in the case 
of two or three, to nearly if not quite $800. At 
Nazareth the yearly expenses are $350. But the 
sums charged at the eight other schools are not un- 
usual in their character, by any means. At the 
Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, the annual 
expenses amount to $900, and at nearly all of the 
preparatory institutions of this high grade the rate
-P-A-G-E-349
  A Last Word 387. 
remains about the same, that is, ranging from $600 
to $900. 
Now the question that occurs to the impartial 
observer in view of such facts as these is this: 
Where shall, or more properly, where can the 
professional man on a small salary, or the business 
man similarly circumstanced, send his son or sons 
to be prepared for college? 
There are the excellent high schools in every im- 
portant town, answers some one. True, and if it 
be a day school that the parent has in mind, these 
will serve the purpose well. But it may be that 
the parent considers that the discipline and experi- 
ence of a boarding-school is what his child most 
needs, and in certain localities the companions of the 
boy in all but the higher grades of day school are, 
from their nationality, objectionable personal habits, 
or what not, undesirable. To remove him from 
these associates will naturally be the wish of the 
parent who hopes to train up his son to observe the 
manners and customs of refined surroundings. The 
discipline of the public school is in most cases prefs
-P-A-G-E-350
  
  338 Some Famous American Schools 
erable to that of the private day school, and for that 
reason the latter institution does not offer the parent 
a wholly satisfactory solution of his problem. 
The day school of either kind being, for one 
reason or another, out of the question for him, and 
with a preference for the boarding-school still lurk- 
ing somewhere in his mind, the parent who would 
like to give his son the best, but whose yearly 
income is scarcely twice the shih required to send 
his boy for a year to Lawrenceville or Groton, let 
us say, is far from seeing his way clear to giving 
his son the education of a gentleman. 
But think of the scholarships at these schools; of 
the assistance often afforded to sons of clergymen 
and other professional men as regards their educa- 
tion, some one else observes. True, there are the 
scholarships, by means of which many a deserving 
lad has been helped toward a higher education. But 
when all is said, scholarships are not every-day af- 
fairs, and their number is not increasing in propor- 
tion to the number of boys who need them. 
The existence of such excellent ‘ church” and
-P-A-G-E-351
  A Last: Word 330 
other schools of the type of the Holderness School 
for boys, in Holderness, New Hampshire, has been 
suggested as offering a partial answer to the ques- 
tion we have been asking, but the answer-is only | 
partial, after all, for schools like Holderness are 
not too frequently met with. 
The plain fact remains that, when all has been 
said regarding scholarships and other aids, “ the 
equipment and maintenance of a first-class boarding- 
school and the quality of its teaching make it too 
expensive for people in humble circumstances,” as 
the rector of the Shattuck School observes in his 
readable historic sketch of that institution. 
The rector goes on to say that since men of 
ability come up from all conditions in life, it would 
seem to be for the public good that aid should be 
extended in some systematic way to boys desirous 
of benefiting by the instruction obtainable in such 
institutions of high rank, but to whom the way is 
closed without such aid. His solution of the prob- 
lem is an ample endowment, so that the way can  
-P-A-G-E-352

340 Some Famous American Schools 
be made much easier and plainer than it now is for 
people of small means, but of refinement and cul- 
ture, to educate their sons in the great middle 
schools, as well as to allow of a certain proportion 
of ambitious lads from plainer homes enjoying the 
same privilege. And it may be that his contention 
furnishes the best answer at present to the question. 
There is a story told of a lad of the people who 
one day applied at the public library in a certain 
town for “ The Adventures of Mike Mulligan, the 
Masher,” Lut was informed by the somewhat super- 
cilious attendant that there was no such work in 
the library. 
“Well, then,” returned the unabashed applicant, 
“gimme ‘ Roaring Ralph of the Rialto,’ or ‘The 
Gory Galoot of the Gaultees.’” 
“We don’t have such books here,” said the li- 
brarian, frostily. 
“Wot’s this here lib’ry fur?” began the indig- 
nant fiction seeker, and then, answering his own 
query, added, with withering sarcasm, “I know
-P-A-G-E-353
  
A Last Word 341 
wot it’s fur, I do; it’s fur the rich, and the poor 
workin’ boy don’t git no chance at all.” 
As for the moral of this little tale, it lies, of 
course, in the nature of the application that may be 
made of it. 
THE END.

  FOREWORD 
The Committee desires to express its appreciation 
and gratitude to the many architects who have con- 
tributed data needed to prepare the building tabula- 
tions; to the educators who have helped by their 
criticisms; to the school boards and superintendents 
who have aided in the study of school buildings; and 
especially to the General Education Board without 
whose aid these investigations would have been im- 
possible.

CHAPTER I 
THE PROCESS OF PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTING 
A SCHOOL BUILDING 
Many of the mistakes of the past would have been avoided 
if there had been a clear conception of the steps that should be 
taken in planning and constructing a school building. The 
purpose of this chapter is to set forth these steps in their proper 
order and to give specific suggestions regarding them.

I Appointment of Investigating Committee, when necessary. 
In most cases the school board is in a position to secure through 
its superintendent the necessary data and to recommend to the 
voters of a town or to the appropriating board in a city the ad- 
ditional school accommodations needed. Sometimes, however, 
it becomes necessary or desirable to have a special investigating 
committee for this purpose. Such a committee should contain 
representatives of the school board. 
II Survey of Needs and Existing Accommodations. Before 
any community, — city, town, or other municipality, — author- 
izes the expenditure of money for a new school building, the 
authorities should make sure that the proposed building will 
contribute to and be an integral and consistent part of a satis- 
factory and comprehensive school building program. A well 
constructed modern building, with such enlargements as may be 
needed from time to time, should continue its usefulness for at 
least fifty years. Each new building tends to fix the organization 
of the school system for better or for worse. The location of the 
building is permanent and involves not only the convenience of 
the pupils in reaching the building, but also the more important 
considerations as to the surroundings of the building, its freedom 
from external noise and odors, and space adequate for out-door 
physical education and for future enlargements cf the building 
without encroachment’on play areas. 
For these reasons, a survey should be made in all cases of 
reasonable doubt as to the best organization of the school system 
or the desirable location of any particular building. The im- 
portance of such a survey may be seen from considerations, 
such as the following: 
In many parts of the country there is a tendency to establish 
too many small elementary school buildings. This policy not 
only increases the costs of maintenance and supervision but also 
prevents the broadening of the school activities to meet the 
diversified needs of elementary school children, including in par- 
ticular health education and preparation for the worthy use of 
leisure time. : 
There is to-day a very general movement to reorganize the 
seventh and eighth grades with the ninth or first year of the
-P-A-G-E-9
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 9 
high school in a modern program of secondary education. The 
application of this movement in towns and smaller cities consists 
in housing these grades or junior high school in the same building 
with the senior high school where all the pupils above the sixth 
grade can share in the facilities provided for the high school with- 
out needless duplication. Thus the six-year high school may be 
planned as a single administrative unit. 
III Determination of the Number of Pupils to be Accom- 
modated by the Proposed Building. On the basis of the findings 
of the survey a decision should be made as to the number of pupils 
that should be accommodated by the proposed building. 
Until recently little thought was given to planning school 
buildings so that they could be readily enlarged. Now, no plan 
is acceptable unless it provides for economical expansion. If a 
building is made much larger than will be needed for a few years’ 
growth, there is waste due to interest charges on the extra expendi- 
ture. When building costs are high, it is especially unwise to 
anticipate too many years of growth in actual building. 
It is, however, necessary to estimate the probable and the 
maximum growth in the number that should be accommodated 
in extensions to the building in order to secure an adequate site. 
Such an estimate is necessary also in order to allow adequate 
space in the plan for those special facilities that cannot be en- 
larged economically. 
IV Appointment of Building Committee, when necessary. 
In some cities the school board is responsible for the planning and 
constructing of all school buildings. In other cities the school 
board is responsible only for the approval of plans, while all other 
duties in connection with planning and constructing the building 
are entrusted to a building committee. In still other cities the 
school board does not even have the power to approve plans. 
Good business sense would insist that no school building 
should be erected without taking every precaution to see that it 
meets the needs of the school. The board elected by the people 
to conduct the schools has the best opportunity to know the 
actual needs of the schools and is therefore the body that should 
be held responsible for the approval of plans. 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
10 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
Increasing recognition is given to the fact that the school 
board itself must contain persons with business ability, and where 
this practice is followed, the simplest and most satisfactory 
method is to place the entire responsibility for building construc- 
tion and maintenance under the direction of the school board. 
V_ Selection of Architect. A number of the larger cities in 
the United States employ a school architect.on salary. By this 
method they are able to standardize many elements in their plans, 
to adapt. their buildings progressively to local needs, to profit 
fully by past experience, and to secure continuing studies of school accommodations needed. Among the cities following this 
practice are: New_York, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Cleve- 
land, Minneapolis, Washington, D. C., Portland, Ore., Seattle. 
Wash., and Akron, Ohio. 
Some other cities employ persons to work out standards or 
determine educational requirements and then employ architects 
on commission to design the buildings and prepare working draw- 
ings. Among these cities are Boston, Detroit, Oakland and 
Rochester. 
The selection of the architect is the most important. step 
in the_planning and constructing of a school, for upon his skill 
and judgment will depend to the largest extent the success or 
failure of the building. When conditions force the employment 
of a_man of limited experience, a consulting_architect who is a 
specialist in school architecture should_be employed. 
As stated in the report ‘“ High-School Buildings and Grounds” 
prepared by the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary 
Education, appointed by the National Education Association, 
Page 7: 
“Recent investigations by the National Education Association’s Committee 
on Schoolhouse Planning and Construction show that schoolhouse planni is 
been in incompetent h: ing extent. Owing to the many mistakes 
evidenced in poorly planned school buildings, and the handicaps such mistakes 
are placing on educational progress, schoolmen are becoming alive to the fact 
that there is an intimate relation between the building plan and the operating 
plan of a modern school. Consequently, they.are-awakening to. importance 
of employing an expert in school planning. High-school buildings are among the 
most complicated and difficult ‘structures to plan and construct. They demand 
the hi, ype of architectural and engineering ability. Their success or fail- 
ure depends, in a large measure, on the professional fitness and executive ability 
of the architect.” eee
-P-A-G-E-11
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 11 
There are two methods of selecting an architect, the first 
of which is the only satisfactory method: 
(1) On the basis of ability and experience in school construction, 
(2) Bycompetition. 
The above report states further, Page 8: 
  “There is abundant evidence through many successfully executed high- 
school buildings throughout the country to prove that the most satisfactory pro- 
ents and executed cedure is to select an architect who, by his professional attainm« 
Ona baaseetece iectomaere heatimenco buildings. 
If a competition is held the following suggestions should be 
followed; 
The competition should be limited absolutely to persons who 
have demonstrated their ability to.plan and construct satisfac- 
tory schools. Moreover, a wide.experience in school architecture 
i$ essential as every school involves new problems. The young 
practitioner should secure his experience in the employ of a firm 
doing school work, and never where-his mistakes must be at the 
expense..of the public and its youth. The winning of a com- 
petition if not limited to competent persons is no guarantee that 
the person is competent since the competition plans do not in- 
clude details of planning and do not reveal a knowledge of con- 
struction or executive ability. 
The qualifications of each person desiring to compete should 
be checked up by Chart 1. 
It should be noted that successful experience in planning 
elementary schools is not of itself a sufficient preparation for 
planning high schools since the latter involve different and more 
intricate problems. 
Each competitor should be given a definite schedule of rooms 
desired. Otherwise the competition , is likely to turn on the al abilit 
of the competitors to guess what is _wanted. rather tl than. to plan 
efficiently. The making of such schedules is discussed in Chap- 
ter II. 
The committee making the award should have the advice 
of one or more persons who are experts in studying-and.judging 
plans. for_public. schools on the basis of their adaptation to edu-  
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
cational needs. Frequently the committee has less actual knowl- 
edge of requirements.than the competing architects and conse- 
quently the best plan is not.likely.to be selected. 
Each competitor should receive an honorarium in recogni- 
tion of his services. 
CHART 1 
ESSENTIAL QUALITIES OF A SCHOOL ARCHITECT 
The architect personally in charge of a school plan should possess: 
EAMILIARITY with modern educational practice.and the activities 
conducted in.a modern school in so far as they affect planning. 
He must visualize the way in which the school and its classes 
carry on their work, in order to handle details satisfactorily. 
OPENMINDEDNESS to suggestions and willingness.to.cevise 
plans so long as they can be improved. He must not cut short 
the consideration of educational features. 
ORIGINALITY AND EXTENDED EXPERIENCE IN SCHOOL 
ARCHITECTURE. Every building presents new problems and 
—both experience and originality are needed to cope with them. 
PROFESSIONAL SPIRIT shown by his desire to secure the solu- 
tions that are best for the community and its.children. 
secure the best results. 
The architect’s organization should include someone who has 
demonstrated his ability through the planning and construction of a 
large number of schools that are really efficient when judged by com- 
petent persons. No building can be judged fairly without knowing its 
cost. Expensive buildings must be judged by high standards of con- 
struction and all buildings should be judged by high standards of 
planning, including safety. 
His organization, including the experts he employs, should be 
masters of: 
(a) Design as applicable to schools. 
(b) Construction appropriate to schools. 
(c) Heating and ventilating of schools. 
(d) Engineering. 
  Even after the competition is decided, a restudy.of the plans. 
is generally necessary. The winning plans frequently have to be 
revised so extensively as.to_be hardly recognizable. Better re- 
sults would be secured if the committee and the architect wete 
able to confer at every step, and this is not possible under the 
competition plan. Hence recourse to a competition should be
-P-A-G-E-13
  
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 13 
taken only as a last reso SS is unable to to decide 
    equally good.” 
Among the essential qualities that should be possessed by 
the building are those given in Chart 3. 
CHART 2 
ESSENTIAL QUALITIES OF THE SITE 
ADEQUATE SIZE* 
(a) For the building and its future extensions. 
(b) For the proper setting of the building and its removal from 
the noise and dust of the street. 
“(c) For outdoor games and physica) education. 
(d) For school gardens, if desired. 
ORIENTATION OF BUILDING. Most classrooms should have 
sunlight part of the day. This result is obtained most readily if 
the site permits the Jong axis of the building to extend approxi- 
mately north and south. 
FREEDOM FROM NOISE AND ODORS. Avoid proximity to 
railroads, gas plants, factories, and other sources of injurious 
noise and odors. 
SUITABILITY FOR CONSTRUCTION. Avoid low, filled, and 
wet land. Avoid abrupt changes in grade unless the building can 
be readily adapted to them. Ledge rocks may increase cost of 
foundation. 
SAFETY. Elementary schools especially should not be located 
on dangerous thoroughfares. 
HEALTHFULNESS. Abundance of fresh air and sunlight and 
freedom from noise, dust, and odors are conducive to health. 
REASONABLE CENTRALITY TO CONTRIBUTING AREA. Ex- 
act centrality is not as important as other factors. 
REASONABLE ACCESSIBILITY. When many children must 
come by railroad or trolley the school should not be too far dis- 
tant from them. 
  * Note: To make sure that the size is adequate, the building and its future 
extensions should be plotted, as should also the approaches and the spaces for 
outdoor games and physical education and, if desired, for school gardens. 
VI Determination of Schedule of Rooms. A schedule of 
rooms should be prepared under the direction of the superinten- 
dent of schools, in conference with the principal and teachers 
of special subjects, submitted to the school board for approval, 
and transmitted to the architect for his guidance. This schedule
-P-A-G-E-14
14 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
should include each room required, give its distinctive purpose 
and any supplementary uses, the pupil capacity desired, and the 
equipment necessary. The making of such schedules is discussed 
in Chapter II. 
The preparation of the schedule is placed after the selection 
of the architect in order to secure his assistance. It is placed 
before the selection of the site because it has a bearing on the 
size of the building and hence on the size of site. 
VII Selection of the Site. Eight essential qualities of the 
site are given in Chart 2. 
The contributing area should be determined so as to estimate 
the probable and possible future growth. In cities it is generally 
agreed that the contributing areas for schools may be as follows: 
For elementary schools, a radius of 4% to 34 of a mile. 
For junior high schools, a radius of 114 to 144 miles. 
For senior high schools, a radius of 114 to 2 miles. 
The above are regarded as reasonable walking distances. 
In rural regions, the contributing areas may well be enlarged, 
with provisions for transportation of pupils, in order to secure 
more effective school units. 
VIII Preparation and Approval of the Plans. Nine essen- 
tial qualities in the building are given in Chart 3.

-P-A-G-E-15
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 15 
The preparation and approval of the plans should consist 
of several steps in order that each part of the work shall be care- 
fully revised as it proceeds. This method not only facilitates 
careful consideration but also reduces the reluctance to make 
revisions. Some of the steps may be combined in the case of 
small buildings. These steps are as follows: 
Choice of the General Plan. 
Preparation of the Site Plan. 
Preparation of Skeleton Floor Plans. 
Approval of Site Plan and Skeleton Floor Plans. 
Preparation of Equipment Floor Plans. 
Approval of Equipment Floor Plans. 
Preparation of Complete Working Drawings and Specifi- 
cations. 
Approval of Complete Working Drawings and Specifi- 
cations.* 
* Note: In some States building plans must by law be submitted to the 
State Board of Education or to some other State authority for approval. Even 
where not required by law, it is well that plans be submitted to State authorities 
to make certain that all laws are being obeyed and that expert counsel may be: 
obtained. 
Nooufhwnr co 
1 Choice of the General Plan. Upon the wise choice of the 
general plan will depend much of the success in attaining the 
essential qualities of the building. 
Some of the more common types and the chief considerations 
that should determine the choice are given in Chapter III. 
2 Preparation of the Site Plan. The site plan should 
include: 
(a) The topography of the site with contour lines or the 
elevation of a sufficient number of points to show the natural 
grades. 
(b) The compass to show orientation. 
(c) The outline location of the building and its future 
extensions, and the spaces reserved for outdoor physical education. 
(d) The level, or height of the ground floor and the levels 
of the proposed finished grade contiguous to the building.  
-P-A-G-E-16
16 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
3 Preparation of the Skeleton Floor Plans. The skeleton 
plans of each floor should include: 
(a) The dimensions and pupil capacity of each room. 
(b) The provisions for the care of street clothing. 
(c) The width of corridors and stairways. 
(d) The number of toilets. 
(e) The adminstrative rooms. 
(f) The compass to show orientation. 
4 Approval of Site Pian and Skeleton Floor Plans. The site 
plan and skeleton floor plans should be subjected to the following 
tests: 
(a) Adaptation to Educational Needs. The plan should 
conform|to the schedule’of rooms already adopted. 
(b) Safety. The corridors and stairways should permit 
the building to be vacated in three minutes even if one stairway 
is made useless by smoke. 
Each stairway should be continuous and connect directly 
with an exit on the outside of the building. 
Each room should discharge its pupils to a corridor leading 
directly to a stairway. 
For more detailed suggestions see Chapter IX. 
(c) Healthfulness. Every room should have abundant 
natural light. The orientation should provide direct sunlight 
except in the case of a few rooms in which a northern exposure 
may be preferred. 
The toilets should be distributed conveniently on each floor 
and should have windows opening directly to the open air. Where 
possible they should receive direct sunlight. 
There should be a sufficient number of bubblers for drink- 
ing purposes so located that their use will not block traffic. 
Washbowls should be adequate in number and some should 
be provided near the lunch room. 
The gymnasium should have an abundance of direct sunlight, 
windows should be placed on at least two opposite sides to give 
cross ventilation, and the windows should extend to, or nearly 
to, the floor level on at least one side. 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION Li? 
To avoid damp, insanitary, or poorly ventilated rooms there 
should be no basement as this term is usually understood, with 
the possible exception of space for the heating plant. This plant 
should, when possible, be located entirely without the confines 
of the building. 
In rural communities the one-story type is often desirable, 
as it is a reasonable guarantee of safety in case of fire. 
To avoid excessive climbing of stairs, the building should 
not contain more than three stories and no basement, except in 
congested cities where land is very expensive. In the latter case 
elevators should be provided. For medium sized buildings two 
stories without basement are recommended. 
(d) Convenience. The location of rooms with reference 
to one another should be carefully studied. 
In high schools the various rooms used by a given department 
should be on the same floor and contiguous to one another. 
Supply closets should connect with the rooms that they 
serve. 
(e) Expansiveness. The building should be so planned that 
it can be enlarged as much as may be needed without unnecessary 
cost and without cutting off the natural light and ventilation 
of any of the existing rooms. 
By placing the stairways adjacent to the outside walls at the 
ends of the building instead of placing them in the corridor, it is 
frequently possible to add a single tier of classrooms without any 
change in stairways and without adding stairways. 
To cover the needs growing out of the future addition of a 
few rooms, it is frequently desirable to plan certain facilities, such 
as administrative rooms, toilet rooms and various special rooms, 
‘so that they will serve the enlarged school. It then becomes only 
necessary to add classrooms. 
The heating plant should always be planned so that it can 
be doubled or trebled in size to take care of future extensions. 
In the past, provision for adding a few rooms has been re- 
garded as adequate provision for expansion. Experience however 
indicates that hereafter, buildings, and especially those for junior 
and senior high schools, should so be planned that they can be 
doubled or trebled in size. 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
18 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
(f) Flexibility. Since it is not possible to foresee all the 
requirements of the future, every school building should be so 
planned and constructed that changes can be made if necessary 
in the lengths of the rooms. For this reason the heat and vent 
ducts should not be placed in the partitions between classrooms. 
These partitions between rooms should be non-supporting, so 
that two classrooms can be converted into one, or three into two 
at minimum expense. 
Moreover, in order to provide for flexibility in planning the 
original building as well as for future changes, the plan should 
provide long areas which can be subdivided as desired into class- 
rooms and special rooms, giving each room as much as it needs 
and no more. A plan that does not provide these long areas is 
almost sure to involve poor arrangements and articulation of 
rooms and necessitate making many rooms either too small or 
needlessly large. These long areas often may be obtained by 
proper placement of stairways and toilets. 
(g) Esthetic Fitness. The skill of the architect as a de- 
signer is shown in his ability to clothe the building with a pleasing 
exterior without doing violence to the needs of the interior. The 
exterior elevations should reflect the major functions of the 
school itself. It should give evidence of the fact that the building 
is a pleasant and attractive place in which young people are 
happily and busily engaged in worth-while enterprises. For- 
tunately, an exterior which thus reflects the interior functions 
should be and generally is more satisfying and interesting than 
one that ignores these functions. The architect should be able 
to secure whatever elements may be desirable without sacrificing 
interior arrangements. 
The interior likewise should produce attractive and pleasing 
effects. The decoration should be modest and cheerful. The 
finish must be such as to lead the pupils to take pride in keeping 
the building free from injury and all disfiguration. 
(h) Economy. Economy in the plan is to be secured by: 
1 Accurate determination of the size needed for each room. 
This depends in turn upon the adoption of scientifically studied 
layouts and is considered under the equipment plan. 
2 Duplicate uses of rooms. This is discussed under the 
determination of the schedule of rooms.
-P-A-G-E-19
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 19 
3 Elimination of waste areas. To detect the presence of 
waste areas the plan should be measured in accordance with the 
rules adopted by this committee and given in Chapter VI of this 
report. As stated in that chapter the percentages of floor area 
devoted to ‘Instruction’? (which includes not only classrooms, 
laboratories, and shops but also the auditorium, gymnasium and 
library and their accessories and study halls, also lunch rooms 
if used as study halls) should be not less than 50 per centum of the 
total floor area, and may, under favorable conditions and careful 
planning, reach 60 per centum or even more. 
5 Preparation of Equipment Plans. The equipment plans 
should show the width of aisles and passageways and the location 
and horizontal dimensions of all equipment including: 
Pupils’ desks, tables, benches Machines 
and stands Ice boxes 
Blackboards and tackboards Bookcases 
Cases and cabinets for materials Lockers and wardrobes 
Hoods Teachers’ desks 
Sinks and drain boards Stoves and ranges 
The preparation of these equipment plans requires time and 
study, and there is a strong temptation to guess at details or to 
omit them entirely at this stage in order to begin the preparation 
of working drawings and let contracts, with the expectation of 
working out equipment details later. This is always a mistake 
and is almost sure to cause serious blunders either in wasted 
spaces or in cramped spaces. 
The architect should be required to show these layouts even 
if his contract does not include a commission on the purchase 
of equipment. 
6 Approval of the Equipment Floor Plan. Before the equip- 
ment plan is drawn up by the architect, studies should be made 
by the superintendent of schools and the principal who is to 
administer the proposed building. Before they complete their 
studies, they should call for the advice of heads of departments, 
supervisors, or other competent persons in the system. These 
studies should then be presented to the architect in writing. 
This plan requires time but time spent at this point saves time
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
later, avoids expensive changes in plans, and saves money in 
the end. It also satisfies those who are to administer and to 
use the building and its equipment that they have obtained the 
best arrangement under the circumstances, thus avoiding the 
grumbling and adverse criticism which so often follows the erec- 
tion of a new building. 
7 and 8 Working Drawings. This chapter deals with the 
planning of a school building and not with its construction. 
Hence no treatment is given at this time to the remaining steps

CHAPTER II 
DETERMINATION OF THE SCHEDULE OF ROOMS 
1 Undeparimentalized Elementary Schools. 
Work-Study-Play, Duplicate, or Platoon Elementary Schools. 
3 Modern Junior, Senior, and Six-Year High Schools. 
In Chapter I it is stated that the schedule of rooms should 
be adopted before the site is selected and that this schedule should 
be prepared under the direction of the superintendent of schools 
and approved by the school board. 
A scientifically prepared schedule of rooms will greatly re- 
duce the cost of the building and at the same time increase the 
educational efficiency of the school. Hence the superintendent 
should secure the advice or persons best qualified to assist. He 
should consult the principal of the school who should know the 
local needs. In special cases he might consult a specialist in edu- 
cational engineering who can bring his wider experience to bear 
upon the local problem. A new building ordinarily means a larger 
school with a more modern program and these changes affect 
the distribution of pupils and hence the schedule of rooms. The 
need for such expert advice is especially great for elementary 
schools on the work-study-play plan and for junior or senior 
high schools. 
The methods to be employed in making the schedule of 
rooms depend upon the type of the school. For this purpose 
three distinct types may be distinguished: failure to recognize 
their essential differences is to invite disaster in making the 
schedule. These failures have been especially noticeable in the 
case of some architects and building committees who have at- 
temped to plan modern high schools on the basis of the organiza- 
tion of the high schools that they attended as boys. 
21

The three distinct types are: 
1 Undepartmentalized elementary schools. 
2 Work-study - play, duplicate, or platoon elementary 
schools. 
3 Modern, junior, senior, and six-year high school. 
The fundamental differences in the rooms required for these 
types may be seen from Chart 4.

  of rooms for the three above-mentioned types of schools: 
1 UNDEPARTMENTALIZED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
As indicated in Chart 4 this type of school requires enough 
classrooms to accommodate all the pupils at one time and the
-P-A-G-E-23
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 23 
following observations may be helpful in determining the’ de- 
sirable pupil capacities of classrooms. i 
  As a general rule, an elementary school classroom should be 
planned large enough to accommodate the normal number of pupils 
that one teacher can instruct effectively and no more. 
If the school, however, contemplates the formation of ability 
groups in each grade it may be desirable to make the most rapid 
and the least rapid groups smaller than groups of average ability. 
Hence, under this plan it may be desirable to have some smaller 
rooms for the most rapid and the least rapid groups. 
In elementary schools so large as to require several rooms 
for each grade and not having ability groups the classes in each 
grade need not vary much in size. Consequently, in such a 
school the rooms for each grade may be uniform in size. 
In cities where many children could go to schools on either 
side of their homes, the size of classes can be adjusted by trans- 
ferring a few pupils from one school in which a grade is crowded 
to another in which that grade is not crowded. When a grade is 
crowded in all schools the situation demands the taking of ad- 
ditional rooms for that grade. If all grades are crowded then 
additional accommodations are needed. Since the size of classes 
in these city schools can be thus regulated the rooms for each 
grade may be made uniform in size. It should be noted that 
additional classrooms are not actually necessary so long as ad- 
justments can be made by the above mentioned transfers. 
In places where the population is not so located that such 
transfers are feasible there will be considerable variation from 
year to year in the number of pupils that must be accommodated 
in each grade. To reduce the number of vacant sittings, there- 
fore, it may be desirable to have some variation in the capacity 
of rooms. It must be borne in mind, however, that a room which 
is to be used for pupils of different grades in different years must 
be equipped with blackboards that can be used by pupils of any 
of those grades. In such a room it may be desirable to place 
movable seats so that they can be readily taken from one room 
to another so as to fit the needs from year to year. In such schools 
a few of the rooms may be slightly oversized, but undersized 
rooms should be avoided if the population is likely to increase.
-P-A-G-E-24
  24 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
The special rooms in an undepartmentalized elementary 
school should include: 
A gymnasium, with dressing and shower rooms. 
An auditorium. In a small school the gymnasium may be 
used also as the auditorium. 
Lunch room, if children come from a distance. 
Sewing and cooking rooms. 
Woodworking shop. 
Play rooms are not desirable in a school having a proper 
gymnasium. Basement play rooms are especially objectionable. 
As already stated, basements should be eliminated for all pur- 
poses with the possible exception of heating plants. 
2 Work — Stupy — PLAY, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Plans for work-study-play, duplicate, or platoon ele- 
mentary schools have been scientifically developed by a number 
of cities. The plans in Detroit are set forth clearly in a bulletin 
entitled “The Platoon School in Detroit’? by Charles L. Spain 
and issued by the Board of Education, Detroit, Michigan. The 
following data are taken from that bulletin: 
The school is divided into two platoons known as Platoon X 
and Platoon Y. The schoo! day is arranged as follows: 
Classrooms Special Rooms 
8:30-10:00 A.M. Platoon X Platoon Y 
10:00-11:30 A.M. Platoon Y Platoon X 
12:30- 2:00 P.M. Platoon X Platoon Y 
2:00- 3:30 P.M. Platoon Y Platoon X 
Hence every: class spends three hours daily in classrooms 
and three hours daily in special rooms. 
In order that no teacher need teach more than five hours in 
any one day, relief teachers are provided. 
Detroit has adopted the 6-3-3 plan and the platoon school 
is intended eventually to accommodate only pupils in grades 1 
to 6. At present, however, some 7th and 8th grade classes are 
included where junior high schools are not yet available. 
Detroit has standardized the programs and the building
-P-A-G-E-25
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 25 
plans for platoon schools of various sizes. The range of special 
rooms depends to some extent upon the size of the school. Some 
of the data for the 20-section school are as follows: (Chart 5.)

classes from neighboring schools not having shops.

Kindergartens are included in the school building but are not included in 
the above tabulation. 
Chart 5 clearly shows that the platoon school requires only 
one-half as many ‘‘classrooms” as does the undepartmentalized 
elementary school, thereby effecting a great saving in building 
costs. 
3 MOobDERN JUNIOR, SENIOR, AND SIX-YEAR HIGH SCHOOLS 
The scientific determination of a schedule of rooms for a 
modern junior, senior, or six-year high school is indeed difficult 
because of the many factors involved. 
Not only must present local conditions be taken into account, 
but also the trends in secondary education throughout the coun- 
ry. These impending changes demand flexibility in the plan,
-P-A-G-E-26
26 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
as discussed in Chapter I, so that adjustments that cannot be 
foreseen may be made in the building when necessary. 
1 INCORRECT METHODS. 
The need for a scientific method can perhaps be seen more 
clearly if we first point out the errors in two incorrect methods 
commonly used. These incorrect methods may be called: 
(a) The method based on classroom seats. 
(b) The method based on home-room seats. 
(a) Method based on Classroom Seats. This incorrect method 
assumes that the capacity of the school equals the sum of the 
number of seats in classrooms. It is expressed by the formula 
C=Gh+Ch+Cs. + Ch + 2... etc, 
in which C equals the capacity of the school and Cl,, Cl, Cls, etc. 
are the capacities of the various classrooms. 
According to this incorrect method special rooms are not 
counted in determining the capacity of the school. This formula 
sometimes leads building committees to make classrooms too 
large and to provide too few special rooms. The oversized class- 
rooms waste money and the absence of enough special rooms 
restricts the educational program. 
The formula is incorrect in nearly every case. If the class- 
rooms are very large and few special rooms are added the build- 
ing will not accommodate at work the desired number of pupils. 
If the classrooms are correct in size and the proper number of 
special rooms are provided the building will accommodate more 
pupils than are given by the use of the formula. 
(b) Method Based on Home-Room Accommodations. This 
incorrect method assumes that the capacity of the school equals 
the number of seats in rooms that can be used as home rooms. 
It is expressed by the formula 
C2#Hi+H.+Het+........-.. etc. 
in which C equals the capacity of the school and Hi, H2, Hs, ete. 
are the capacities of the rooms that can be used as home rooms. 
Nearly every room can be used as a home room, but, on 
account of the varying sizes of classes, there will be vacant places 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION at 
when work is in progress unless all vacant stations are occupied 
by pupils studying. This method of providing for study is wrong. 
Hence the formula overestimates the capacity of the building. 
2 Correct METHODS. 
Several correct methods may be devised for determining the 
schedule of rooms needed for a high school. All of these methods 
must be based on the actual conditions under which the work 
should be conducted. This report sets forth three correct methods, 
from which choice may be made, depending on the time available 
and the data accessible. These methods are: 
(a) Method based on Schedule of Classes. 
(b) Method based on Number of Pupils in each Subject. 
(c) Method based on Average Distribution of Pupils to 
Recitations, Gymnasium and Study. 
The first of these methods is generally the most difficult to 
work out but the results are the most readily comprehended. 
Whatever method is selected, it is suggested that a second 
method be used as a check. 
The three methods will be illustrated by applying them to a 
hypothetical junior high school of 360 pupils with a given program 
of studies and comparing the results. The third method will be 
further illustrated by applying it to two senior high schools also 
accommodating 360 pupils each. 
(a) Method based on Schedule of Classes. This method 
consists of making a schedule of classes for the new school. This 
schedule must be suitable for use when the school reaches its 
saaximum capacity since there is no real problem of accommoda- 
tions when the school is only partially filled. 
A new building should ordinarily make possible a wider 
range of subjects and a more generous time allotment for physical 
education and some of the newer subjects. It should also be 
remembered that improved equipment, such as a new building 
should provide, will lead more pupils to take the newer subjects. 
This method is especially applicable to junior high schools 
since in these schools the pupils are divided into groups known as 
classes, and the pupils of each class follow more or less closely 
a given schedule. (These classes are not necessarily identical
-P-A-G-E-28
28 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
with home room sections since it is generally better to organize 
home rooms so as to contain pupils taking various electives, 
thereby avoiding undemocratic cliques). 
EXPLANATION OF CHART 6 
This chart is made out for a junior high school of 360 pupils. 
The week contains 24 recitation periods and also a club period, 
making 25 periods in all. 
60 minutes is chosen as the length of each period because 
that is the most practical solution in many schools. The 60 
minute period is the shortest in which adequate gymnasium work 
can be conducted, since pupils should be required to change to 
gymnasium suits and follow the exercise with a shower bath. 
The chart is arranged in seven sections and divided into two 
parts: 
Part 1, including Sections 1-4, shows the particular method 
used in making the schedule of classes. This method may be 
called the “Method of Rotating Blocks.” 
Sect. 1 Sets of Periods. The 24 recitation periods are 
divided into 6 sets, each set containing 4 periods. 
Sect. 2 Blocks of Subjects. The subjects are assigned to 
blocks, each block containing 4 periods. 
A subject requiring 4 periods will just fill a block. In view 
of the fact that the recitation periods are 60 minutes in length, 
and in view of the breadth of program needed for junior high 
school pupils, it seems desirable to give no subject more than 4 
periods. 
Subjects requiring fewer than 4 periods are grouped with 
other subjects so as to make 4 periods in each block. 
The particular program of studies included in this chart 
could be discussed at length. Many modifications could be made 
without preventing the use of the general method here developed. 
Note A longer school day containing 6 instead of 5 periods 
is preferable for many reasons. When this longer day can be 
secured there would be 30 periods in the week. One of these 
periods can be used as a club period and another as a general 
assembly period. The remaining 28 periods can then be divided 
into 7 sets of 4 periods each, and the subjects may be assigned to

7 blocks of 4 periods each. This plan is especially desirable be- 
cause it makes it easy to increase the number of physical educa- 
tion periods to 4 instead of 2. 
Sect. 3 Assignment of Classes to Divisions. In order that 
the rooms may be utilized to the best advantage there should be 
as many divisions as there are sets of periods. In this schedule 
the number is six. 
Since there are just 12 classes, each division should contain 
two classes. 
The classes are designated as 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D, 8E, 8F, 9G, 9H, 
81, 85, 9K, OL. 
The figures 7, 8, 9, indicate the grade. 
The letters indicate the division in which the class is placed, 
the first two letters A and B being given to classes in division I, 
C, and D to classes in division II, E and F to classes in division 
II, ete. 
Each pair of classes contains two classes of the same grade, 
thereby permitting the boys from two classes to go to the gym- 
nasium at one time, and the girls to go to the gymnasium at 
another time. As will be seen below, the girls go to science when 
the boys go to gymnasium, and vice versa. In the case of splits 
of this kind the boys from 7a and 7B are designated as 7A and the 
girls as 7B. Similarly in case of 7c and 7p, 7c denotes the boys 
and 7D the girls, etc. 
Sect. 4 Rotation of Blocks to Sets. The key in this portion 
of the chart shows how the blocks of subjects are rotated to the 
sets of periods so as to utilize the rooms as efficiently as possible. 
Part II, including sections 5, 6, and 7, shows how the “sched- 
ule of rooms needed’’ may be made from the “‘schedule of classes.” 
Sect. 5 Schedule of Classes. The scheduling of most of the 
classes is rendered automatic by the use of the key in Sect. 4. 
When two or more subjects are grouped into one block. there 
is some latitude as to the particular period for each subject. 
Sect. 6 Room Chart. Here the classes in each subject are 
brought down from Sect. 5 and entered in the line opposite the 
name of the subject. The special features of this chart are ex- 
plained in connection with Sect. 7. 
Sect. 7 Schedule of Rooms Needed. This concluding sec- 
tion shows that 16 rooms are needed, and indicates the type of,
-P-A-G-E-32
30 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
and capacity desired for, each room. The details in Sect. 6 and 
Sect. 7 can best be explained by subjects following the various 
lines horizontally across the page as follows: 
Gymnasium and Science. Since boys and girls must be or- 
ganized into separate classes for gymnasium work, and the school 
is not large enough to require two gymnasiums as only two periods 
are required of each student, the classes have been arranged so 
that the girls take science while the boys have gymnasium, and 
vice versa. 
As stated on page 29 when two classes in the same division, 
such as 7A and 7B, are split and reorganized into boys’ and girls’ 
sections, 7A denotes the boys of the two classes and 7B the girls. 
It will be now noted that we have secured the excellent ar- 
rangement whereby the gymnasium accommodates all the boys 
in Day One and again in Day Three, thereby separating their 
gymnasium periods by a desirable interval. Similarly the girls 
come on Day Two and again on Day Four. 
The gymnasium is occupied each period by one class of ap- 
proximately 35 pupils. Hence room 1 is to be the gymnasium. 
Similarly a science room will be occupied every period and room 
9 is designated for that purpose. 
Library. Since every class is to go as a class to the library 
one period each week, the library will be thus used 12 periods. 
The library should also accommodate pupils on irregular programs 
having study periods, and should be available at all times for 
reference work by pupils and teachers. Hence the room should 
accommodate such persons even when a class is present. Ac- 
cordingly we have given the library a capacity of 50 pupils. The 
double horizontal line drawn through spare periods denotes that 
the room is to be reserved for study or other library purposes. 
Music. Classes in music may well be conducted in the 
auditorium. In four of the periods, approximately 70 pupils 
take music at one time. This arrangement was made to fit cases 
in which it is desired to have all the work of the music teacher 
concentrated into two days. Doubtless the schedule could have 
been arranged so as to send only one class at a time to music. 
Boys’ Shops and Home Economics. The plan here followed 
is the one whereby a class of 35 pupils is divided, the boys taking  
-P-A-G-E-33
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 31 
shop work and the girls taking home economics. This gives 
half classes in each subject. Two boys’ shops, and a cooking room 
and a sewing room are therefore required. In many school sys- 
tems the classes in these subjects are not made so small. 
Drawing and Foreign Language. The school requires only 
14 periods of drawing and only 8 periods of foreign language. It 
so happens that the periods do not conflict and consequently room 
8 will accommodate both subjects. Had there been conflicts or 
were some other vacant room better adapted to the foreign lan- 
guage classes they could have been sent elsewhere. 
Commercial Work and Guidance. Similarly it has appeared 
feasible to use one room for both commercial work and classes 
in the new subject known as “Guidance.’”’ Room 10 may well 
be equipped with disappearing typewriters so that the room can 
accommodate all types of commercial work desired in the junior 
high school. 
Mathematics, Social Studies, and English. As may be seen 
from the room charts, two rooms are required for each of these 
subjects. Social studies and English will fill each of their rooms 
every period, and one or the other of the mathematics rooms will 
be vacant only six periods’in all. 
Total Number of Rooms Needed. Our chart shows that 16 
rooms should be provided in order that the work may be con- 
ducted according to the above plan. The aggregate number of 
spare room-periods is 52, or an average of about two rooms each 
period. These vacancies however occur for the most part in the 
auditorium and in shops and home economics rooms. 
The only room that could be spared would be one of the 
rooms numbered 11 to 16, and since the omission of one of these 
rooms would force the use of a room not adapted to the purpose 
every period, or nearly every period, in the week, the economy 
that might thereby be secured would be purchased at too high 
a price in educational efficiency. 
The spare rooms may, however, be used by one or more 
coaching teachers or may be used by an additional class if it is 
found necessary to provide accommodations for such a class. 
(b) Method Based on Number of Pupils in Each Subject. 
The second method is based on the number of pupils in each sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  32 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
ject. This method involves less work than the first method but is 
not quite so reliable as one cannot be sure that the schedule may 
not demand more classes in some subject than will be given by 
this method. Furthermore, the use of a given room by two dif- 
ferent subjects is contingent upon schedule complications. 
That the second method is, however, applicable will be de- 
monstrated by applying it to the same school used above and

EXPLANATION OF CHART 7 
As in the case of Chart 6, we assume that our junior high 
school is to accommodate 360 pupils and that the week is to con- 
tain 24 recitation periods, each 60 minutes in length, and in ad- 
dition a club period. But the club period will not enter into our 
computation since the club work is conducted simultaneously 
in all the rooms at the time set apart for this purpose.
-P-A-G-E-35
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 33 
We will assume that the 360 pupils are distributed as follows: 
Grade 7..... 196 Fupis....) 4 classes averaging 34 pupils each. 
Grade 8... .. 120 Pupils..... 4 classes averaging 30 pupils each. 
Grade 9..... 104 Pupils..... 4 classes averaging 26 pupils each. 
The time allotments for the various subjects will be as in 
Chart 6. 
The computation for each subject is given in a horizontal 
line extending across the chart. 
To illustrate the method we will take the first line “‘Gymna- 
sium — Boys.” 
Since the number of boys in each grade will be approximately 
equal to the number of girls, there will be approximately 68 boys 
in Grade 7. Hence we enter 68 in column A headed “Pupils.” 
We desire in this medium sized school to limit the classes in 
the gymnasium to approximately 35. Hence we enter 35 in column 
B headed “Maximum Class.” 
Dividing the number of pupils by the maximum class we 
obtain the number of classes required. Hence we enter 2 in 
column C headed ‘‘Classes.”’ 
According to the time allotments physical training is to be 
required 2 periods per week. Hence we enter 2 in column D 
headed “Periods.” 
Multiplying the number of classes by the number of periods 
that each class is to have physical training we obtain the number 
of class periods required. Hence we enter 4 in column E headed 
“Class-Periods.”’ 
Similarly we find the number of class-periods required in 
grades 8 and 9 to be 4 each, as given in columns J and O respec- 
tively. Column X, obtained by adding the numbers in columns 
E, J, and O gives the “Total class-periods” required for boys’ 
gymnasium work as 12. 
Passing now to the next horizontal line we find in column X 
that the “Total class-periods” for girls’ gymnasium work is also 12. 
Hence our one gymnasium will accommodate the entire 
school with no class exceeding approximately 35 pupils. 
2
-P-A-G-E-36
  34 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
The total class periods for each subject as given in column 
X in Chart 7 will be found to be identical with the periods given 
for that subject in Chart 6, except in the case of music. The 
exception is due to the fact that in Chart 6 we had four periods 
in which two classes took music in groups of approximately 70 
pupils each. 
Moreover, the “schedule of rooms needed” given in Chart 7 
is identical with the ‘‘schedule of rooms needed” as given in 
Chart 6. 
Reference may well be made at this point to the discussion 
in this chapter as to the undesirability of attempting to econ- 
omize by reducing the number of rooms below 16 in this school. 
CavuTION In using this method it is important that the 
“number of classes,’”’ (columns C, H, M) obtained by dividing the 
number of ‘“‘pupils” by the “‘maximum class’ be not recorded too 
small. Not only must a fraction be counted as another unit, but 
in case the division is close and there is reasonable doubt as to the 
possibility of making each class close to the maximum, a unit 
should be added. In the case of grade 7, 136 pupils can be organ- 
ized as 4 classes not exceeding 35, but in grade 9 it would not be 
likely, on account of the electives, that 104 pupils could be or- 
ganized into fewer than 4 classes. 
(c) Method based on Average Distribution of Pupils to In- 
struction, Gymnasium and Study. The third method is especially 
valuable when it is difficult to obtain as definite information as is 
required in the two preceding methods. Its use, however, does 
require familiarity with high school organization and approxi- 
mate information regarding: 
1 The total periods in the week available for classes. 
2 The average number of periods per week that the pupils 
will spend in the gymnasium, in study including the library, and 
in instruction. (By instruction we mean class work in all sub- 
jects except physical training). 
3 The average size of instruction classes. (This subject is 
discussed in Chapter IV). 
4 The approximate amount of work to be taken in subjects 
requiring the various rooms with special equipment.
-P-A-G-E-37
  
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 35 
The method is set forth in Charts 8 and 9. Chart 8 develops 
the formulas for determining the distribution of pupils to instruc- 
tion, gymnasium, and study and applies these formulas to three 
schools. Chart 9 utilizes the results obtained in Chart 8 for the 
purpose of working out the schedule of rooms needed. 
The three schools used in these charts are designated as 
schoo!s A, B, and C. Each school contains 360 pupils. 
School A is the junior high school used in the first two methods 
and the ‘“‘schedule of rooms needed” obtained in Chart 9 is identi- 
cal with the results obtained in Charts 6 and 7. 
Schools B and C are senior high schools. School B has 30 
periods each 60 minutes and School C has 35 periods each 45 
minutes. 
EXPLANATION OF CHART 8 
The first part of this chart is self-explanatory. 
In the second part, the “average distribution of periods per 
pupil” for the three schools may need some explanation. 
For School A g=2 and s=1. This is in accordance with the 
time allotments for this school given in Chart 6. Every class was 
given two periods of gymnasium work, one period of library, and 
there were no free periods for study. However, a few pupils on 
irregular programs will have study periods, and we have allowed 
for this fact by adding the + sign to the 1 allowed for the library 
period. 
The gymnasium periods are increased to 4 in School C. This 
is due to the fact that the periods in that school are only 45 minutes 
in length and hence double periods are necessary. 
The instruction periods are also greater in School C than in 
School B since the shorter period necessitates double periods for 
physics and chemistry, home economics, and shop work. 
EXPLANATION OF CHART 9 
The “Average Size of Instruction Classes,’ denoted by A 
in the Chart, for the first school is given as 30. This is consistent 
with Charts 6 and 7 where classes in home economics and shop 
work are counted as half classes. For Schools B and C we have 
made A=20. This is consistent with the conclusions in Chapter 4.

it will be counted as a half-room if used continuously, or as less 
than a half if used only part of the time. These statements ex-

In making up the ‘Schedule of Rooms Needed” for any 
particular school it is necessary to take many factors into con- 
sideration. The schedules given for Schools B and C are merely 
suggestive.

It should be noted that there is no difficulty in securing suf- 
ficient “home stations” in any of the schools. As stated earlier 
in this chapter the capacity of a school is not determined by the 
possible home stations, but is determined by the number of rooms 
in which work can be conducted.

CHAPTER II 
CHOICE OF THE GENERAL PLAN i 
By the general plan of the building is meant the shape of its 
exterior outline. 
Chart 10 gives some of the important types and lists the 
chief considerations that should be used in determining the gen- 
eral plan for any particular school. 
The types may be classified as closed and open types. The 
closed types given on the chart are: 
1 The solid rectangle. 
2 The hollow rectangle. 
3 The rectangle with interior auditorium and courts. 
The open types given in the chart are: 
4 Thel 
5 The? 
6 TheU 
7 The E 
8 The H 
As indicated on Chart 10, the chief considerations in de- 
termining the general plan are: 
1 Orientation. 
Natural light and natural ventilation of the rooms. 
Expansiveness. 
Flexibility. 
Light corridors. 
Effective supervision. 
Reduction of vertical travel.

light part of the day. A direct southern exposure is not desir- 
able as the light and heat will be too intense in the middle of the 
day. Consequently the corridors serving most of the rooms 
should run approximately north and south, so that the rooms will 
face approximately east or approximately west. Science rooms 
should have direct sunlight for plant growth and for experiments 
in light. For these reasons a direct southern exposure is allow- 
able for science rooms, although an eastern or south eastern 
exposure is preferred. 
Drawing rooms should have a northern or northerly exposure. 
Consideration must also be given to the orientation of 
future extensions. 
If the building can face approximately east or approximately 
west and the building can extend as far as necessary north and 
south, then the I or the T will provide excellent orientation. 
The rectangular types do not give good orientation. Their 
orientation is not so objectionable when the sides face northeast, 
southeast, etc., instead of facing directly north, east, etc., as 
there will then be no direct southern or northern exposures and 
the northerly rooms will get some direct sunlight for a brief period. 
2 Natural Light and Natural Ventilation. The open types, 
such as those on Chart 10, generally afford the best natural light 
and ventilation. 
The closed types seldom permit cross ventilation for the 
gymnasium. They are generally hard to design economically 
and efficiently on account of the dark inside corners. They are 
especially objectionable if interior rooms rely upon courts of 
ordinary width for light and ventilation. 
3 Expansiveness. The location of future extensions should 
be indicated. The general plan should be such as to give these 
extensions proper orientation and adequate light and ventilation 
without cutting off the light and ventilation of any of the rooms 
in the original building. Here again the open types are generally 
preferable. 
4 Flexibility. Flexibility in planning and in making any 
uture changes demands long areas unobstructed by supporting
-P-A-G-E-44
  42 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
partitions, heat and vent flues, stairways, and toilets. These 
long areas can be secured in any of the types given on Chart 10, 
if properly laid out. 
5 Light Corridors. The plan should always provide ade- 
quate natural light for all corridors. When rooms line both sides 
of a long corridor, light should be introduced by means of bays 
or locker alcoves as well as by wire glass in classroom doors. 
As a general rule corridors should extend to the outer walls, 
where they should be lighted with large windows extending to 
the ceiling. The outside view also adds greatly to the attrac- 
tiveness of the corridor. The common plan of placing stair- 
wells at the ends of corridors should ordinarily be abandoned 
as such stairwells diminish the light and cut off the outlook. 
They also interfere with the economical expansion of the build- 
ing when placed at the ends where expansion is likely to occur. 
Stairwells should generally be placed at right angles to corridors 
and lead directly to exits on the outside of the building. 
6 Effective Supervision. It is desirable that the corridors 
on each floor be so related that the principal, a teacher, or a pupil 
monitor can see the entire length of every corridor. 
7 Reduction of Vertical Travel. The climbing of several 
flights of stairs is especially objectionable between recitation 
periods in which pupils have been sitting still for some time, 
because it places a sudden strain on the heart. This is one of the 
reasons for avoiding, when possible, the building of schools with 
more than three floors. For this and other reasons the one story 
building is recommended for small schools, and buildings of two 
or three stories without basements for all other schools where 
land prices are not prohibitive. 
Vertical travel may be reduced in a three story building by 
placing rooms having a large floor area per pupil, such as lab- 
oratories and shops, on the lowest and highest floors. 
8 isthetic Fitness. As stated in Chapter I the exterior 
elevations should express in simple and dignified form the main 
purposes served by the various sections of the school. Fortu- 
nately, an exterior that thus reflects the interior functions should 
be and generally is more interesting than one that ignores these 
functions.
-P-A-G-E-45
  
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 43 
9 Economy. As stated in Chapter VI the committee found 
from its measurements of buildings that nearly every type con- 
tained some buildings that stood high and others that stood low 
in the percentage of floor area devoted to instruction. This 
proved the fact that careful study is necessary in order to effect 
space economy, and that the selection of a suitable type is of 
itself no guarantee that there will be no waste. 
Nevertheless waste can be eliminated more successfully in 
some types than in others. Elimination of waste is especially 
difficult in some of the rectangular buildings that involve dark 
corners and in complicated plans that involve angles with irregu- 
lar spaces. 
The elimination of excessive areas for classrooms is also an 
important factor of economy. 
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The following additional considerations should be observed 
in selecting and developing the general plan. 
1 Width Classifications of Rooms. The type plan should 
provide suitable and economical widths for the various rooms. 
On the basis of width, rooms fall into three classes: 
(a) Rooms whose width may well equal the standard class- 
room width, which is now regarded as approximately 22 to 24 
feet. This class includes: Classrooms, study halls, libraries, 
home-economics and commercial rooms, laboratories, and ad- 
ministrative rooms. For these rooms a narrower width is un- 
economical and a greater width necessitates higher ceilings. An 
exception occurs when the additional width is top-lighted or is 
used for storage closets or when corner rooms have light on two 
sides and are used for laboratories or other subjects for which 
cross light is not objectionable. 
(b) Rooms whose width must exceed 24 feet. This class 
includes auditoriums and gymnasiums. 
(c) Rooms whose width may most economically exceed 24 
feet. This class includes gymnasium accessories and lunch 
rooms when not used as study halls, for the reason that sup- 
porting columns may be used to diminish structural spans and 
because the area need not be as brightly lighted as classrooms. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  44 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
2 Central Location of Administrative Offices. The adminis- 
trative offices should be so located as to be in ready commu- 
nication with the school asa whole. They also should be so placed 
that visitors need not wander around the building to find the 
office suite. They should be on the same floor as the main entrance 
and near to it. A location adjoining the main entrance is good. 
A location on the opposite side of the corridor and facing the 
main entrance is even better. 
3 Creation of New Types. Due attention to the foregoing 
considerations will surely cause the rejection of many types of 
buildings formerly used, the modification of other types, and the 
creation of new types. Among the new types now being evolved 
may be mentioned the “Oriented I” type. 
The “Oriented I’? has rooms of classroom width on both 
sides of a main corridor running approximately north and south. 
These rooms, therefore, have east light and west light respec- 
tively. The auditorium and gymnasium are placed at one or 
both ends of the building with their axes at right angles to the 
main corridor. With this placement the gymnasium readily 
secures cross ventilation and it does not cut off the natural light 
and ventilation of classrooms. If both gymnasium and audito- 
rium are placed at one end of the building, the other end may 
be most readily available for the future addition of rooms of 
classroom width. 
When applied to a small school having a single room to serve 
as auditorium and gymnasium, the ends of the gymnasium need 
not extend far beyond the walls of the main building.

CHAPTER IV 
CAPACITY OF INSTRUCTION ROOMS 
The considerations upon which the capacity of instruction 
rooms should be based are somewhat different in the three groups 
of schools discussed in Chapter II, namely: 
1 Undepartmentalized elementary schools. 
2 Work - study - play plan, duplicate, or platoon schools. 
3 Junior and senior high schools. 
In undepartmentalized elementary schools nearly all the 
work of a given class is conducted in a given classroom. The size 
of classes may in many cases be adjusted by transferring pupils 
from one school building to another. Hence, we have the rule 
given in Chapter II that ordinarily classrooms should be large 
enough to accommodate the normal number of pupils that one 
teacher can teach effectively and no more. It was pointed out, 
however, that economy may sometimes be secured in such schools 
by having some variation in the size of classrooms so that classes 
too large to divide economically may be placed in the larger 
rooms. 
In the case of work-study - play, duplicate, or platoon 
schools, the classes go as classes from room to room and hence 
every room must be large enough to accommodate the number 
of students in the maximum sized class that should be organized 
in the school. It will be more economical in such a school to 
avoid all oversized classes than to make all of the rooms over- 
sized. Hence in these schools the maximum size of class should 
be fixed at a number not exceeding the normal size of class es- 
tablished. 
45 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  46 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
Junior high schools are similar to platoon schools in that 
as a general rule the pupils move in classes with comparatively 
little individual variation and hence the capacity of instruction 
rooms may well be made uniform. 
In four-year and senior high schools, on account of the wide 
range of electives and the individual programs necessitated 
thereby, the classes will vary greatly in size. Consequently, for 
the full consideration of the capacity of instruction rooms in high 
schools it is necessary to distinguish between: 
1 Normal size of classes. 
2 Maximum size of classes. 
3 The average size of classes. 
Let us assume that it is agreed that the normal size of high 
school classes should be 25 to 30 but that a maximum of 35 is 
allowable. Consider the case in which 140 pupils are to take a 
given subject in a given year. These 140 pupils could be divided 
into four classes of 35 pupils each, or 5 classes of 28 pupils each, 
or 6 classes of 23 pupils each. Since, however, it is agreed that 
the normal size of class should be 25 to 30 the approved proceedure 
would be to divide the pupils into five classes. 
Suppose another subject is to be taken by 70 pupils. To 
divide them into three classes would give an average of 23 which 
would be lower than the normal agreed upon, but they might be 
organized into two classes of 35 each without exceeding the 
maximum allowed. 
Again, in a case where 40 students are to take a subject we 
have a number larger than the maximum allowed and hence it 
is necessary to divide them into two classes even though these 
classes fall below the normal agreed upon. 
The question now arises as to the desirability of providing 
rooms to accommodate oversized and undersized classes. Evi- 
dently, our distinction between normal and maximum sized classes 
dictates the necessity of having some of the rooms large enough 
to accommodate the maximum sized class allowed. The number 
of classes, however, that will be greater than the normal, but not 
greater than the maximum, will be comparatively small, and 
hence economy would indicate the wisdom of planning a few

upon but not more than the maximum. 
Is it desirable to provide a few rooms smaller than the stan- 
dard adopted for a normal sized class? On account of the large

number of such small classes many persons have favored the 
construction of a number of such small rooms. This practice, 
however, involves a considerable loss in teaching efficiency be- 
   
-P-A-G-E-50
  48 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
cause it makes it necessary for a teacher having one or two under- 
sized classes to change to one of these smaller rooms for that 
class. Progressive teachers collect and arrange illustrative ma- 
terial for their work, adding greatly to the effectiveness of instruc- 
tion. This material cannot well be moved from room to room 
between periods, and, therefore, the small gain effected by having 
these undersized rooms is purchased at too great a cost in educa- 
tional efficiency. 
Another objection to the undersized rooms is that when the 
school grows in size the proportion of small classes will decrease 
and these rooms will not be found to be economical. 
NORMAL AND MAXIMUM SIZE OF INSTRUCTION CLASSES 
Decision as to the normal and maximum size of classes to 
provide for may be aided by the results of two state surveys given

Chart 11 gives the per cent. of classes of various sizes, exclu- 
sive of classes in music and physical training, in 240 Massachu- 
setts high schools in the year 1916-17. This survey included all 
the Massachusetts high schools, except those in Boston and in one 
small town. The high schools were divided into five groups on 
the basis of size. 
Group I contained the largest high schools — namely 
those of over 500 pupils. 
Group II high schools of 201 to 500 pupils. 
Group III high schools of 101 to 200 pupils 
Group IV high schools of 51 to 100 pupils, and 
Group V_ high schools of 1 to 50 pupils. 
The graph shows the percentage of classes of various sizes 
in each group. 
In the case of the largest high schools we find that 1% of 
the classes contained not over 5 pupils. 
4% contained 6 to 10 pupils 
11% contained 11 to 15 pupils. 
22% contained 16 to 20 pupils. 
26% contained 21 to 25 pupils. 
22% contained 26 to 30 pupils. 
10% contained 31 to 35 pupils. 
4% contained over 35 pupils. 
In group 1, 70% of the classes had 16 to 30 pupils. 
In group 2, 61% of the classes had 11 to 25 pupils. 
In group 3, 63% of the classes had 6 to 20 pupils. 
In group 4, 72% of the classes had 6 to 20 pupils. 
In'group 5, 75 Yok the classes had 1 to 15 pupils. 
The classes of fewer than 16 pupils in every group were due 
primarily to the fact that many subjects were taken by few pupils 
and not to the dividing of larger classes into sections. 
In practically all the schools the normal size of class was 
probably regarded as 16 to 25 or 20 to 30. 
In planning on the standard capacity for instruction rooms
-P-A-G-E-52
  50 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
it should be remembered that high schools grow from small to 
medium sized and from medium sized to large schools. Hence 
the standard should not be made too small. 
On the other hand, it should be remembered that classes of 
over 30 or 35 are generally regarded as too large for the best 
results and that classes of over 30 or 35 are generally permitted 
only when the excess is so slight as not to warrant the division of 
one class into two classes. 
There is at present a tendency to permit a larger percentage 
of classes of 31 to 36 pupils. This tendency is due in part to the 
need for higher salaries for better trained teachers, to the de- 
sirability of adding new functions such as deanships, educational 
measurements, modern physical education programs, and to the 
importance of a wider range of subjects to meet the greatly di- 
versified needs of pupils. 
In small high schools the percentage of classes of over 30 
pupils will be small, and high schools employing a large percentage 
of inexperienced teachers should keep classes down in size. 
Hence the problem of determining the capacity of instruc- 
tion rooms may generally be solved by adopting 30 or 35 or 36 
as the standard for most rooms and providing a few rooms to 
accommodate 36 to 42 pupils. Special consideration should be 
given to the capacity of shops and laboratories. 
The lower part of Chart 11 gives the results of a similar sur- 
vey in Connecticut in 1921, which included all the high schools 
in the state. 
AVERAGE SIZE OF INSTRUCTION CLASSES 
This chart is especially valuable for the light that it throws 
on the average size of classes that may be expected in any 
high school. This average is needed in order to determine 
the number of instruction rooms necessary in order that the 
building may accommodate the desired number of pupils. This 
average is used in the third method given in Charts 8 and 9 in 
Chapter II. 
Disregarding the few classes of over 35 pupils, the averages 
are given on each chart for each group of schools. The results

on the two charts are strikingly similar as may be seen from the 
following summary:

CHAPTER V 
CAPACITY OF, LIBRARIES AND STUDY HALLS 
SECTION 1 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS 
It is the approved practice in junior high schools to give the 
pupils regular library periods in which they go, as classes, to the 
library. During these library periods they are taught to use 
reference material and have an opportunity to read for pleasure 
and enjoyment for the purpose of developing a love for books 
and reading. In the time allotment for the junior high school 
in Chapter II each class had one library period per week. Since 
the students go as classes to the library it should be at least large 
enough to accommodate a full-sized class at a time. 
In many junior high schools the pupils are assigned to some 
definite subject every period in the week and, consequently, 
have no regular study periods such as are found in the senior 
high school. Under the form known as “supervised study” or 
“directed learning,” they study each subject in a part of the same 
period in which they recite that subject. In most junior high 
schools, however, a few pupils have irregular programs which 
include a number of unassigned periods to be used for study. By 
somewhat increasing the size of the library it will provide for 
these individual pupils having study periods and also for teachers 
who may find the library the best place in which to work when 
not teaching. 
In view of the above considerations, the following rules are 
suggested for determining the capacity of a junior high school 
library. 
1 Even in the smallest junior high school the library should 
accommodate at one time a normal sized class and at the same 
time provide for pupils likely to have individual study periods 
52
-P-A-G-E-55
    
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 53 
and teachers likely to want to use the library at that time. In 
accordance with this rule, the minimum capacity may well be 
regarded as 50. If the school is very small the library may, when 
available, be’used for other classes. 
F j oF If the total number of library periods for all the classes 
in the school exceeds the number of periods in the week available 
for classes so that two or more classes must be assigned to the 
library at one time, the library should be large enough to accom- 
modate these classes and at the same time provide for pupils 
having individual study periods and teachers desiring to use the 
library. 
Conference rooms separated from the library by part-glass 
partitions constitute one of the most valuable modern develop- 
ments in junior and senior high school buildings. Each conference 
room should accommodate six persons at a library table three 
feet by five feet and a row of book shelves. Hence the conference 
rooms should be approximately eight by twelve feet. Several 
of these conference rooms should be provided in every school. 
They should so be placed that the librarian will have direct super- 
vision of the pupils at work without moving from the desk at 
which she ordinarily does her work. These conference roomsfare 
necessary in order that pupils may have a place in which to work 
upon group projects or other group problems. The traditional 
building generally contains no place in which such work can be 
carried on for the reason that these pupils are too young and 
immature to make it desirable for them to work in a room over 
which no teacher has supervision, and it is not possible for them 
to discuss a problem in a room where classes are being conducted 
without disturbing others. The library conference rooms provide 
ideal conditions for this kind of work. They are near the library 
where reference material may be easily secured and the assis- 
tance of the librarian obtained. Pupils may discuss their problems 
in these rooms without disturbing others and supervision is pro- 
vided by means of the part-glass partitions. These conference 
rooms also provide an excellent place in which teachers may work 
with small groups of pupils who need special assistance. These 
rooms involve no great expense since their capacity may be 
included as a part of the pupil-capacity needed for the library.
-P-A-G-E-56
  
54 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
SECTION 2 FOUR-YEAR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS 
(A) Libraries. The N. E. A. Committee on Standards for 
Libraries recommends that the library seat from five to ten per 
cent. of the total enrollment of the schooi. 
The ten per cent. established by this rule does not seem to 
meet the needs of small high schools. Since most of these schools 
are unable to employ a full-time librarian or to spare the time of 
other teachers to supervise the room, it has been deemed advis- 
able to keep the library in the study hall. Under this plan the 
library will be available during the entire day and every pupil 
will have access to the library during every study period. 
In the case of the large high school the rule does not seem 
sufficiently definite as the difference between five and ten per 
cent. is very great. 
In view of the above considerations, the following rule is 
suggested: 
The capacity of a library for a four-year or senior high school should not 
be less than fifty for the first five hundred pupils, and the capacity should be 
increased by five for every one hundred over five hundred. 
In schools in which the average number of pupils having 
study periods exceeds 75 to 100 pupils, one or two separate study 
halls may well be provided, but the library should continue to ac- 
commodate not less than fifty. These study halls should be placed 
on one or both ends of the library and be connected with the 
library by a special passageway so that pupils may go to the 
library without the necessity of securing a corridor pass. This 
greatly increases the use likely to be made of the library. In these 
schools requiring study halls in addition to the library, every pupil 
may well be assigned to the library one or more definite periods in 
each week in order that contact with the library may be assured, 
and that the library may be counted in determining the capacity 
of the building, thereby reducing the amount of space necessary 
for study halls. There should, however, be available a reasonable 
number of unassigned seats for the use of pupils desiring to go to 
the library from the study halls and for teachers desiring to make 
use of the library. 
(B) Provisions for Study in Four-year and Senior High 
Schools. As indicated in Chapter II, the number of study periods
-P-A-G-E-57
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 55 
for each pupil varies in different schools, depending upon the 
number of periods in the week. There are four methods of caring 
for study in four-year and senior high schools as follows: 
1 The Rear-seat System. This consists in assigning study 
pupils to the rear seats of rooms in which recitations are being 
conducted. This method is objectionable on educational grounds 
and has been discarded in modern buildings. 
2 Session Rooms. This plan consists in having one or more 
large rooms with a total seating capacity equal to the number of 
pupils in the school. This method is feasible in very small high 
schools enrolling not more than 60 to 75 pupils. In larger schools 
it is extremely expensive and is not recommended. 
3 Study Halls and Libraries. This method consists in pro- 
viding enough sittings in the library and in study halls to take 
care of all study pupils. This gives good conditions for study and 
is easily administered. If, however, enough sittings are provided 
to care for the maximum number of pupils who will be studying 
at any one time there will be many vacant sittings during many 
periods. 
A study hall should be equal in size to two or possibly three 
standard classrooms and so planned that it can be divided if 
desired into classrooms. Such a room will accommodate ap- 
proximately 75 to 100 pupils. Larger study halls are not desirable. 
4 Vacant Instruction Rooms. This method consists of 
assigning pupils for study at any given period to: 
(a) Special rooms not needed at that period for the special 
purpose for which designed, and 
(b) Classrooms of teachers having free periods. 
As a general rule, the study group is put under the charge 
of the teacher who regularly conducts his classes in that room. 
The advantages of this method are: (1) the study groups 
are small, and (2) the teacher can work in his own room, and 
therefore use his time to good advantage. 
The disadvantages of this method, when used exclusively, are: 
1 The pupils do not have as ready access to the library as 
they would in a study hall articulated with the library. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
56 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
2 TIf used exclusively, nearly all the free periods of teachers 
are used for supervision of study groups with the result that they 
are not available for other important duties. 
_ 3 The clerical work of locating pupils and checking absences 
is-increased because the study pupils are scattered in so many 
rooms and are in different rooms during different study periods. 
4 When the school becomes crowded, there is the danger 
that the rear seat method, which is so objectionable, will be re- 
sorted to. 
The vacant classroom method, however, may well be utilized 
for the purpose of taking care of the pupils in excess of the average 
number who would be studying at any one time. 
(C) Conclusions Regarding Libraries and Study Halls in 
Four-year and Senior High Schools. In very small schools of not 
over 60 to 75 pupils there may be a main room to seat the entire 
school. The library will be placed in this room and each pupil 
will study at his own desk and the room will be freed of recita- 
tions as far as possible. 
In schools of 100 to 300 pupils there should be a library- 
study hall accommodating 50 to 75 pupils. 
In schools in which the average number of pupils studying 
at any one time exceeds 75 or 100 there should be a library accom- 
modating 50 or more, and one or more study halls each accom- 
modating approximately 75 pupils. 
The combined capacity of library and study halls need not 
exceed the average number of pupils studying at a time, as the 
excess during periods having more than the average can be ac- 
commodated most economically by the method of using vacant 
instruction rooms. A lunch room when properly lighted and 
satisfactorily separable from the kitchen and service counters 
also may be economically used as an overflow study hall.

CHAPTER VI 
DETECTING WASTE IN THE PLAN 
1 Causes and Nature of Waste. The chief causes of waste 
in the plan of a school building and the nature of these wastes 
are as follows: 
(a) Uneconomicat Layouts for Rooms. The furniture equip- 
ment and aisles may be excessive in size, thereby using too many 
square feet of area for the number of pupils accommodated. They 
may be too small, cramping the work. They may be poorly placed, 
thereby securing poor results in light, convenience, and space 
economy. 
This subject is briefly considered in Chapter I, but much 
scientific study is needed regarding these layouts.’ 
(b) A Faulty Schedule of Rooms. The number of rooms 
needed for various purposes may not be accurately determined, 
thereby warping the educational program. The pupil capacity 
of various rooms may be made too great, thereby producing an 
excessive number of vacant places when the school is in operation. 
The pupil capacity of various rooms may be made too small, 
thereby either increasing the cost of instruction by requiring the 
division of classes, or decreasing the efficiency of instruction by 
requiring teachers to continually change from room to room to 
fit the classes to the rooms. 
Suggestions for determining the schedule of rooms and their 
desirable capacities are given in Chapters IJ, IV, and V. 
(c) Unwise Choice of the General Plan. This may lead to 
poorly lighted areas or irregular angles that cannot be used eco- 
nomically, or to rooms or corridors with inadequate natural light 
and natural ventilation. 
Suggestions as to the choice of the general plan are given in 
Chapter III. 
57
-P-A-G-E-60
  58 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
(d) Excessive Areas for Purposes Other Than Instruction. 
(“‘Instruction” includes in this chapter, as will be explained 
later, the gymnasium, auditorium, and library, and their acces- 
sories, and study halls. It also includes lunch rooms if used for 
study halls.) 
Without the thorough study and restudy of plans there is 
sure to be an excessive amount of floor area used for walls, par- 
titions, flues, stairways, corridors, toilets, wardrobes, heating 
and ventilating apparatus, administrative offices, storage rooms, 
and other areas not directly connected with instruction rooms. 
Necessary as these provisions are, they can so be planned as not 
to occupy excessive areas. 
The main purpose of this chapter is to determine the areas 
that may reasonably be allowed for purposes other than instruc- 
tion and to indicate a method of detecting waste due to excessive 
areas for them. 
2 Amount of Waste. The amount of waste due to the 
fourth cause has been estimated approximately by the committee. 
It has been found from the measurement of over 200 school 
buildings that the per cent. of area for instruction varies from 
60% or more in some buildings to 40% or less in other buildings. 
(All of these buildings were supposed to be good buildings, If 
admittedly poor buildings had been included the precents for 
instruction would have fallen much lower.) The variation from 
40% to 60% means that with a given cubic content, and at a 
given cost, some buildings yield only 24 of the return in educa- 
tional efficiency which they should yield. Turning it around, we 
can say that by careful study and restudy some architects have 
greatly improved the efficiency of their buildings by raising the 
productive areas, thereby increasing the efficiency of the plan. 
In some cases the low percentage of productive areas has 
been due in part to the desire of building committees to have 
unnecessary or unwarranted features introduced into the plan, 
without realizing the cost involved. In these cases it is the duty 
of the architect to state clearly and explicitly the cost of these 
unwarranted features. In other cases the wastes are due to 
State regulations that are without scientific justification. In 
general, however, the responsibility for waste due to a low per cent.
-P-A-G-E-61
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 59 
of productive area belongs primarily to the architect and this 
fact should be borne in mind when individuals recommend the 
employment of an architect without adequate experience in plan- 
ning schools. 
The amount of waste due to the first three causes mentioned 
above has not been accurately measured. Observation, however, 
has shown many buildings in which the layouts of instruction 
rooms were extremely wasteful. Not infrequently a better 
planned layout would have made it possible to reduce the size 
of the room by 20% to 30% of its area without in any way cramp- 
ing the work and without reducing the floor area per pupil below 
desirable standards. Again, buildings are built even now on the 
basis of a schedule of rooms that lacks balance and involves rooms 
with excessive pupil capacities that serve no necessary or useful 
purpose. The blame for bad layouts and unscientific schedules 
of rooms should properly be shared by the architect and the 
educational authorities. 
The total amount of waste in school buildings due to these 
four combined causes is enormous. The remedy can be found 
only in the employment of experts in school architecture and 
educational advisers who have studied their problems thoroughly. 
An illustration of this lack of economy due to layouts of in- 
struction rooms is shown in the case of two printing shops in the 
same city designed by the same architect. These shops are in 
two different schools of the same general type and each shop is 
intended to accommodate twelve pupils. One has a floor area of 
713 square feet and the other 1050 square feet. If the smaller 
shop provides adequate area for the successful activities of a 
printing class of twelve pupils, then the larger shop has a waste 
of 337 square feet. The additional area in the larger shop not 
only represents extra cost for construction and heating, but may 
result in reduced efficiency because of the distances between fa- 
cilities that should be close at hand. On the other hand, if all 
the room in the larger shop is needed, the smaller shop must be 
cramped. To secure the best results not only areas but also ar- 
rangements of equipment need continued study. In this case 
the second shop may have embodied the improvements’ that the 
really progressive school architect is continually making in his 
own work.

3 Significance of Waste. Waste in the plan means waste in 
public money available for school buildings. It means continued 
waste in the repairs, ventilation, heating, janitorial service, and 
upkeep of buildings that are needlessly large for the service they 
render. In many communities, waste in the plan means that the 
funds that these communities can and will appropriate will be 
exhausted before the needs of some of the children for suitable, 
safe, and sanitary buildings can be provided. 
4 Method of Detecting Waste Due to Excessive Areas for 
Purposes Other than Instruction. 
In developing its method for detecting waste due to excessive 
areas for purposes other than instruction, the committee took 
the six following steps: 
A Classification of floor areas into six main divisions, five 
devoted to non-instruction purposes and the sixth to instruction. 
B Establishment of rules for measuring and classifying 
areas. 
C. Selection of plans of over 200 school buildings to be 
measured. 
D Measurement of plans and reduction of areas to per 
cents. 
E Study of plans and per cents. 
F Establishment of maximum standards for the five non- 
instruction divisions and of minimum standards for the instruc- 
tion division. 
These steps are outlined in the six following sections: 
A Classification of Floor Areas into Six Main Divisions. 
After extended study and conference with architects and 
educators the committee decided to group all the floor areas 
found in school buildings into the six following main divisions. 
They include every square foot of floor area in every building. 
The first five divisions are called non-instruction divisions. 
“Stairs and Corridors’ includes areas that are self explana- 
tory. 
“‘ Administration’’ includes the rooms for officials, instructors, 
medical department, service and storage rooms, general ward-
-P-A-G-E-63
  
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 61 
robes, sanitaries, and the area used for the heating and ventilating 
apparatus. 
“Walls and Partitions” includes the floor areas occupied by 
the exterior walls and the interior partitions. 
“Flues” includes the area occupied by the vertical flues. 
“‘ Accessories’ includes closets, store rooms, and other areas 
not directly connected with the other divisions. 
“Instruction” includes the floor areas used by all departments 
for purposes of instruction, including auditorium, gymnasium, 
and their necessary accessories. It also includes the lunch room 
when so planned that it can be used effectively as a study room. 
The six main divisions and their sub-divisions have for prac- 
tical use been worked out in the ten charts given at the end of 
this chapter. 
B_ Establishment of Rules for Measuring and Classifying 
Areas. 
The second step taken by the committee consisted of the 
establishment of the following twenty rules for the measurement 
and classification of areas: 
1 Every square foot of floor area of the building is to be 
included in the tabulation. The sum of the areas of the used 
basement and each floor is called 100 per cent. Tabulations are 
to be checked until the: sum of the various areas check within 
one-half of one per cent. of the total area. 
2 Line of measurement for area of all floors is to be taken 
at the outside of exterior walls. Deduct all recesses that are the 
full story height. 
3 The area of basement floor is to be measured from same 
line as outside wall of first floor. 
4 Compute each floor and mezzanine separately. 
5 The area of light wells, courts, open air shafts is not to 
be included in floor area. 
6 Areas of arcades, open porches, uncovered corridors, 
pergolas, and open air theatres or auditoriums are to be figured 
separately,
-P-A-G-E-64
  62 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
7 In rooms and auditoriums which extend through more 
than one story the area of such space shall be deducted from the 
floors through which it extends. 
8 In the case of an assembly hall or gymnasium which 
has a balcony, the area of such balcony shall be taken separately. 
9 In figuring walls or partition areas, no door or window 
openings shall be deducted, but the wall shall be figured solid, 
as though no openings occurred. 
10 Exterior walls and interior partitions are to be figured 
the finished thickness including any lath and plastering. 
11 Large piers occurring in rooms are to be deducted from 
floor areas and added to wall areas. 
12 Flues are to be figured to include all surrounding walls 
except walls and partitions figured under 10. 
13 Chimneys are to be figured in as flue areas. 
14 Where closets, bookcases, or dead spaces occur in a 
bank or flues, same are to be figured in as flue area. 
15 Stairs extending a full story in height and stairs leading 
to a mezzanine story are to be taken as stair area. Steps not a 
full story in height are to be taken as part of the floor area of the 
room or corridor in which they occur. 
16 Area of each individual space is to be taken separately 
in accordance with schedule. 
17 Wardrobes are figured inside the walls. 
18 Rooms having wall cabinets are to be figured from 
partition walls. Cabinets are to be included with the room. 
19 Waiting spaces, closets, supply rooms, toilets, etc., in 
connection with offices shall be included with the office with which 
they occur. 
20 Toilets, showers, storage rooms, supply rooms, etc., 
when connected with a main division, shall be taken separately 
but shall be included with the total area of that division. 
C_ Selection of Plans of over 200 School Buildings to be 
Measured. 
The first collection to be measured consisted of the plans of 
about 110 school buildings. 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 63 
They were all selected from the work of architects of such 
standing in their profession as to commend public confidence. 
They included buildings of many types such as buildings of 
one, two and three stories, buildings with and without basements, 
and buildings with and without auditoriums and gymnasiums. 
Some of the schools were situated in rural districts, some in 
small towns and cities, and some in the largest cities of the United 
States. 
They included kindergartens, elementary schools, junior 
and senior high schools, and vocational, industrial and trade 
schools. 
This set of 110 plans was reduced to 80 plans by the elimina- 
tion of those plans that seemed to have special features that 
would make their inclusion misleading, or that were erratic. 
Kindergartens and vocational, industrial and trade schools were 
also excluded. 
The 80 schools finally retained in the group upon which the 
graphs and tables in Section 5 are’ based included only elementary 
schools and junior and senior high schools. They were distributed 
geographically by 24 states as follows: 
California a New Hampshire 1 
Connecticut 2 New Jersey 4 
Delaware 1 New York 6 
Florida 6 North Dakota iD 
Illinois 8 Ohio 8 
Indiana al Oregon 2 
Maryland 1 Pennsylvania © 
Massachusetts 11 Texas 2 
Michigan nA Utah t 
Minnesota 8 Vermont 1 
. Missouri 3 Washington 1 
Nevada 1 Wisconsin 1 
80 
Of these 80 schools 
35 were elementary schools 
6 were junior high schools, and 
39 were high schools including consolidated schools.
-P-A-G-E-66
  64 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
After the study of the first set of 80 plans some members of 
the committee felt that the results might be modified if additional 
schools were tabulated. Accordingly, the committee secured 
about 100 additional plans. But the measurement of these schools 
did not show materially different conditions, except that some of 
the more recent schools revealed more careful planning, induced 
no doubt in part at least by the work of the committee in point- 
ing out sources of waste. 
D Measurement of Plans and Reduction of Areas to Per 
Cents. 
To obtain the percentage of floor area in each of the main 
divisions, the entire floor area of the building was taken as 100%. 
The area of every room, closet, corridor, stairway, flue and wall 
was measured. These areas were grouped under the six main 
divisions. If the sum of all the areas did not tally within one-half 
of one per cent. of the total floor area, the error was searched 
for and the tabulation was not used until the sum of the items 
was brought within one-half of one per cent. of the total area. 
The per cent. of the floor area of each main division to the total 
floor area was then found. 
E Study of Plans and Per Cents. 
For the purpose of comparing the various per cents. obtained 
from measuring the plans, a little strip of cardboard, one inch 
wide and twenty-two inches long was made for each building. 
Twenty inches on each strip represented 100 per cent. and on this 
twenty-inch length there was laid out to scale the per cents. found 
for each of the six main divisions. These strips, which looked like 
candles, were brought together as desired for purposes of com- 
parisons and they were used in laying out the various charts 
showing the results of the study. 
Some statisticians claimed that there could be little similarity 
between the areas of elementary and high school buildings, and 
that consequently it would be necessary to establish separate 
standards for them. This claim was not substantiated. The 
slight differences between these two main divisions of schools. 
and between schools of various types are shown in Charts” 12, 
13, 15, and 16. ;

F Establishment of Maximum Standards for the Five Non- 
Instruction Divisions and of Minimum Standards for the Instruc- 
tion Division. 
On the basis of the measurement and study of the 80 build- 
ings retained from the first set of 110 plans, the committee in 1918 
established its first set of maximum and minimum standards. 
Further study led the committee to revise these standards 
and as finally revised they are shown on the title page in the 
chart termed “The Candle of Ratios” 
This chart is in the form of a candle and has been called by the 
committee the 
CANDLE OF RATIOS 
The name was suggested by the little strips referred to in 
the preceding section. : 
The sum of the percentages allowed by the committee for the 
first five divisions equals 50 per cent. Hence a building in which 
this sum does not exceed 50 per cent. will meet the sixth standard 
of the committee, that is, it will have 50 per cent. or more for 
instruction. As stated in Chart 13, 4714 per cent. of the buildings 
met this standard. 
Suppose now that a building meets every one of the first 
five standards, and that it shows considerable more economy than 
is demanded in at least some of the standards. Then the avail- 
able space for instruction will rise considerably above 50 per cent. 
5 Results form the Study of 80 Buildings. 
The charts in this section are based on the study of the 80 
buildings mentioned in the preceding section. 
As already stated these 80 buildings were selected from 110 
plans by rejecting plans that seemed misleading or erratic. 
They were gathered from 24 states as indicated in the pre- 
ceding section. 
They were all from architects of recognized standing. 
These 80 schools included: 
35 elementary schools 
6 junior high schools, and 
39 high schools (including consolidated schools).

66 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
Chart 12 is a table giving for each of the six main divisions, 
the minimum, maximum and median per cent. for the 35 elemen- 
tary schools, the 6 junior high schools, the 39 high schools, and for 
the 80 schools. It then gives the maximum standard allowed for 
the non-instruction divisions and the minimum standard required © 
for instruction. Finally, it gives the number of schools in each 
group and in the total that meet each standard, the number that 
do not meet each standard, and the per cent. of schools meeting 
each standard. 
From the last column it appears that the junior high schools 
and the high schools, as groups, succeeded much better than did 
elementary schools in meeting the standard for instruction. The 
superiority of the junior high schools is probably due to the fact 
that they are of a more recent type. The superiority of both 
high schools and junior high schools is probably due to the fact 
that they averaged larger buildings, that a larger percentage of 
them had auditoriums and gymnasiums, and that they were 
planned more carefully. It is evident, moreover, from the fact 
that at least 40% of each of the three groups met the standard and 
at least 33% did not and that the median for each group was near 
the standard, that there is no need for separate standards for in- 
struction for the three groups. 
In the five non-instruction divisions we find that elementary 
schools succeeded best in reducing flues and accessories, junior 
high schools in reducing stairs and corridors and walls and par- 
titions, and high schools in reducing administration. The next

chart, while not made for identically the same groups of schools, 
illustrates the conclusions of this paragraph. 
Chart 13 shows graphically the comparison between 17 
elementary schools and 17 high schools with reference to each 
of the six main divisions of floor area. 
The areas found in each type of building were laid out to the 
left and right of the vertical lines indicating zero, except in the 
case of instruction where the vertical line represents 35%. 
The results shown by this chart were surprising even to the 
investigators who had not expected that the elementary schools 
would exceed the high schools in per cents. for administration. 
The column showing the greatest uniformity for all schools 
is the one for walls and partitions, or construction as it may be 
called. This is accounted for because construction is governed 
by building codes. 
Chart 14 shows graphically the per cents. devoted to instruc- 
tion in each of the 80 schools. The horizontal line shows the 
minimum standard established by the committee in accordance 
with which not less than 50% of the total floor area should be 
devoted to “instruction.” 42 schools fall below this minimum 
standard, the lowest devoting only 37.53% to instruction. 38 
schools do better than the minimum standard, the school best 
in this respect devoting 67.95% to instruction. 
Chart 15 shows graphically the variation for instruction for 
23 elementary schools, 11 meeting the minimum standard and 12 
falling below. The other lines across the chart represent the 
areas for the non-instruction divisions. Of course the schools

Heating and ventilating, ranging from 1144% to 15% shows 
an excessive variation, indicating clearly divergent views as to the 
proper methods of ventilation. ( 
Wardrobes range from 144% to 7%. This variation also 
indicates either that some schools do not provide proper care for 
clothing, or that other places do not use economical methods. 
Storage ranges from 0% to 5%. In some cases the architect 
marked storage on waste spaces that he seemed unable to utilize 
otherwise. 
Toilets range from 1% to 644%. 
Offices and teachers’ rest and emergency rooms range from 
YS to 6%.

  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 69 
This chart perhaps indicates more clearly than any other 
chart the need for the study of details in planning a school build- 
ing and for scientific standards based on actual requirements. 
Chart 19 shows the subdivisions of instruction in 47 depart- 
mental schools. All butell of these schools were from among the 
80 schools discussed in this section. 
The variations in the different sub-divisions were as follows: 
For Academic Rooms from 9.5) per cent. to] 36.5 per cent. 
For Laboratories from 0 per cent. to 14.4 per cent. 
For Industrial Shops from 0 per cent. to 30.8 per cent. 
For Agriculture from 0 per cent. to 4.5 per cent. 
For Commercial Rooms from 0 per cent. to 15.5 per cent. 
For Libraries from 0 per cent. to 2.8 per cent. 
For Household Arts from 0 per cent. to 4.0 per cent. 
For Social Activities, including Gymnasium and Audito- 
rium, from 0 per cent. to 31.5 per cent. 
Chart 20. ‘‘What Might Have Been.” 
This chart with its saddest of titles is an attempt to show in 
graphic form the additional areas that could have been devoted 
to instruction, in most cases without any additional cost in con- 
struction, if none of the non-instruction divisions had exceeded 
the maximum standards derived from this study. 
As stated on the chart, the unshaded portion of each column 
shows the per cent. actually given to instruction in each building. 
The shaded portions at the top of each column show the 
excess areas given to the several non-instruction divisions over 
the maximum standards allowed by the committee. 
The whole column shows the total per cent. that would have 
been given to instruction if the excess in each non-instruction 
division had been given to instruction. 
The following facts appear from a study of the chart: 
Only 3 of the 80 buildings met every standard in that they 
had over 50% for instruction and no excess in any non- 
instruction division. 
Seventeen either met every standard or every standard but 
one.

All but 8 of the schools that failed to meet the minimum 
standard for instruction exceeded the maximum stand 
ards for three or more non-instruction divisions. 
10 met every standard except “administration.” 
2 met every standard except “stairs and corridors.” 
1 met every standard except “‘accessories.”’ 
1 met every standard except “walls and partitions.” 
9 met every standard except “administration” and “walls 
and partitions.” 
4 met every standard except “stairs and corridors’ and 
“walls and partitions.” 
Chart 21 shows outline plans of two similar examples of each 
of five different types of school building plans. 
These five different types were selected as being typical 
among seventy-six school buildings under analysis. Of these 
thirty-six buildings were above 50% for instruction and forty 
buildings did not meet this standard.

This part of the study was undertaken to determine if there 
was a particular type of plan especially favorable for a high rating 
in instruction area. 
This chart shows that the wise selection of the general plan 
is not of itself a guarantee that there will be no waste. Only care- 
ful study and planning by the school architect will insure efficiency. 
Chart 22 shows graphically some comparisons between six 
different types of schools commonly found before 1918. Some 
better types have been developed since then. Each type is repre- 
sented by four schools. The shaded portions indicate the amount 
by which each school exceeded or fell below the minimum standard 
of 50% for instruction. The light lines indicate the per cents for 
each of the non-instruction divisions.

The sixth type is the three story high school with basement, 
auditorium, and gymnasium. 
The poorest showing is made by the old-fashioned two-story 
elementary school with a basement and without auditorium or 
gymnasium. 
The best showing is made by the new type one-story elemen- 
tary school without a basement. 
Probably the showing for the new types consisting of two 
and three-story buildings without basements would be even 
better. 
6 Results to be Gained from Tabulating the Floor Plans. 
The tabulation will aid persons interested to translate the 
plan into a problem in economics. 
It is one of the best methods of detecting a kind of waste that 
used to be found in most school plans and that is still found in 
plans that are not carefully studied. 
It will show the problem divided into its simplest units and 
will enable the persons interested to at once point out what gains 
can be made through a restudy of the plan. 
It will arouse the interest of every person who studies the 
plan as a whole. He will appreciate the waste that may exist 
in a seemingly excellent plan and will see the actual benefits to 
be accomplished by a restudy. 
The fact that 50 per cent. or more of the total area is used 
for instruction does not prove that there is no waste within the 
instruction areas. The rooms themselves may be too large for the 
purposes for which they are intended. The aisles may be unneces- 
sarily wide or badly designed and the equipment may be too large, 
or the room may be designed for a larger number of pupils than 
will or should occupy the room. ‘To eliminate these sources of 
waste it is necessary that thorough studies should be made as to 
desirable and economical layouts and to the proper sizes of classes 
in different grades of the elementary school and different sub- 
jects in the high school. 
If, on the other hand, the area for instruction does not equal 
or exceed 50 per cent., or if the areas for any of the other divisions
-P-A-G-E-84
74 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
is much in excess of the percentages given by the committee, then 
it is almost certain that there is waste and the plan should be 
restudied. 
The use of the per cents. of floor areas for purposes of judging 
and restudying plans as applied to school architecture is new. 
The method has been developed by the Committee on Schoolhouse 
Planning and Construction appointed by the National Educa- 
tional Association. 
This method, as already stated, consists of measuring the 
square feet of the main divisions of the plan from architect’s 
drawings and changing these areas into per cents of the entire 
floor area. If there is lack of economy in the plan these per 
cents. will show where departure from the standards occurs. 
Many educators and architects still plan school buildings as 
they did before the war showing that the day of the ‘rule of 
thumb” is not yet ended. Many of them give little study to the 
proportional distribution of areas for the various departments. 
They apparently give much time and attention to relatively trivial 
elements while more serious concerns pass unnoticed. 
Many an architect engaged in the preparation of plans for a 
school building is content with his plan if his committee seems 
satisfied. This type of architect seldom studies what goes on in 
the school building after it leaves his hands. He knows that a 
certain number of rooms are required; that there must be ways 
to approach them; that for so many pupils certain plumbing 
fixtures must be provided; that there must be stairways for exit; 
clocks to tell time; telephones to give communication; a heating 
plant to warm the building; and ventilating ducts to satisfy 
building codes. Oftentimes this architect is a truly educated man, 
the design of his building merits praise and he employs experts to 
arrange for the engineering aspects of his work. He particular- 
izes when he knows, he generalizes and is vague when he does 
not. He knows the art of design and his committee is pleased 
with his work; the educator knows he wants so many rooms, he is 
given them and is content; the inspectors insist that certain 
technical requirements be met and the experts of the architect’s 
organization meet these requirements and the plans are passed; 
but neither the architect nor the educator knows whether there 
is waste in the plan.
-P-A-G-E-85
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 75 
When plans are studied and measurements and tabulations 
are made of the floor area in accordance with the rules presented 
in this study, the per cents. of the main divisions may be easily 
read and comparisons made. By studying the details in the 
tabulations, the superintendent or business official may learn in 
what division certain kinds of waste and lack of economy exist. 
If such waste does exist, he will have positive data from which 
to suggest a restudy of the plan. 
Tabulation of the floor areas according to the rules, compari- 
son of the results, a restudy of the plan if the per cents. show large 
departures from the standards and especially if the per cent. for 
instruction is low, will contribute to securing a more successful 
and economical building. 
NOTE ON CHARTS 23.TO 31 
An early study based on the analysis of more than one hundred school 
buildings resulted in a bulletin the charts of which it seems worth while to 
reproduce in this report. 
The activities noted have not materially changed since the charts were 
prepared, 
Resulting from this study a set of catalogue numbers based on the Dewey 
system has been prepared. This will be found in the appendix,

CHAPTER VII 
STATE REGULATIONS IN SCHOOLHOUSE PLANNING AND 
CONSTRUCTION 
The purpose of this chapter is to show the need for reasonable 
uniformity in State regulations in schoolhouse planning and 
construction... 
The fact that State regulations in this field are in their in- 
fancy may be seen by comparing charts, — Chart 32 gives the 
regulations in 1910, Chart 33 in 1915, and Chart 34 in 1920. 
The first chart was compiled by the chairman of this commit- 
tee in 1910 at the request of the late Dr. Luther H. Gulick, then 
director of child hygiene of the Russell Sage Foundation. At that 
time only four states, — Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey 
and Ohio, — had any State regulations on the construction of 
school buildings. 
The second chart was compiled by the chairman in 1915 at 
the request of Mr. Charles D. Hine, then secretary of the Con- 
necticut State Board of Education. 
The third chart was compiled with the financial assistance 
of the National Educational Association.   
The following table shows the number of states having va- 
rious_provisions-in_1910, 1915, and 1920.

The few states that had no regulations in 1920 on the plan- 
ning and construction of school buildings were Arkansas, Mis- 
sissippi, Missouri and Washington. 
While 44 states had some regulations in this field in 1920 the 
fragmentary condition of these regulations may be seen from the 
following facts: 
There are 58 items included in Chart 34 (1920). Only 1 
state, Delaware, had regulations on every item. Only 16 states 
had regulations on half or more of the items. These states with

       CHAPTER VIII 
ILLUMINATION 
The Committee secured the co-operation of Frank N. Free- 
man, Professor of Education in the University of Chicago, in 
making a series of investigations on the subject of illumination as 
related to the planning and construction of school buildings. 
This arrangement was made financially possible through funds 
placed at the disposal of the Committee by the General Education 
Board. 
Professor Freeman recommends that further studies are 
needed on certain phases of the investigation. In this report 
by means of interesting experiments he proves that with 5 foot 
candles as a standard of illumination, unfavorable conditions 
may combine to make the lighting in certain parts of a school- 
room very unsatisfactory. Six possible methods of solving this 
difficulty are suggested in the following report: 
AN INVESTIGATION OF THE ILLUMINATION 
REQUIREMENTS OF SCHOOL BUILDINGS 
FRANK N. FREEMAN, University of Chicago 
THE PROBLEM 
The problem of this investigation as it was first presented 
was to determine how much light was necessary or desirable for 
reading. This was the phase of the problem which was indicated 
first and upon which the most work has been done. It appeared 
when a preliminary report of the work was presented that it 
would not be sufficient to determine the amount of light which 
was necessary but that it was also desirable to extend the inves- 
tigation so as to determine how the building should be constructed 
and arranged in order that the required amount of light might be 
90
-P-A-G-E-101
    
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 91 
secured. A beginning has been made upon this phase of the 
problem but the results which have been obtained thus far are 
only of suggestive value. 
Part 1 The Experiment on the Illumination Standard. 
In its preliminary report on a code of Lighting for School 
Buildings issued August 1917, the Illuminating Engineering 
Society laid down the following standards for classrooms, study 
rooms, libraries, laboratories, blackboards: 
With artificial lighting With daylight 
Minimum Ordinary practice Minimum Ordinary practice 
Foot-Candles  Foot-Candles Foot-Candles Foot-Candles 
3.0 3.5 — 6.0 6.0 7-12 
The report adds that the upper portion of the range of in- 
tensities given as representing ordinary practice is preferable to 
the lower and that when economy does not prohibit, even higher 
intensities than those cited are often desirable. In brief, the 
recommendations of the Illuminating Engineering Society are 
that in those rooms where reading is one of the chief activities 
of the pupils an illumination of 6 foot-candles or higher with 
artificial lighting and of 12 foot-candles or higher with day light 
should be maintained. The present study was undertaken in 
order to get more exact experimental evidence than has hitherto 
been obtained upon the correctness of these and other current 
standards of illumination. 
Since in class rooms, study rooms, and libraries reading is 
the most important activity making demands upon the vision of 
pupils, the first object of this study is to measure the effect of 
different intensities of illumination upon the act of reading. If 
we can determine how well pupils can read under different in- 
tensities we will at least have some of the fundamental facts upon 
which we can base a judgment regarding the intensity of illumina- 
tion that is necessary or desirable. Other effects of the intensity 
of illumination may also have to be measured, but the measure 
of its effect on reading will at least carry us a long step toward the 
ultimate solution of the problem. The results obtained thus far 
are offered as constituting a partial determination of the bearing 
of reading on illumination standards.
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
In this investigation the general plan of scientific experimenta- 
tion was followed, which consists in isolating and studying the 
effect of one factor at a time. The first and most fundamental 
factor in the visual aspect of the act of reading is the ability to 
recognize the printed letters or words. The first measurement, 
therefore, gave a determination of the effect of different intensities 
upon the ability to make out printed letters. Letters were used 
rather than words since groups of letters could be standardized 
as of equal difficulty more exactly than groups of words. 
APPARATUS AND METHOD 
The apparatus and technique were in brief as follows. The 
intensity of the illumination upon the printed page was governed 
by setting a standardized electric lamp at such a distance as to 
give the required intensity. The distance was worked out accord- 
ing to the law that the intensity of illumination of an object from 
any source of light varies inversely as the square of the distance 
of the source of light from the object. The apparatus for adjust- 
ing the light at any required distance consists of a lamp that can 
be moved nearer to or farther from the text and can be set at the 
required distance by reading from a scale on an endless steel tape. 
The text was placed at right angles to the line of vision of 
the reader, who placed his forehead against a head rest. This 
made it necessary to place the lamp so that its rays fell obliquely 
upon the text. In calculating the illumination intensities a cor- 
rection was made according to the law that the illumination of a 
surface upon which a beam of light falls obliquely is equal to the 
illumination of a surface perpendicular to the beam of light mul- 
tiplied by the cosine of the angle of deviation of the light from the 
perpendicular. 
By means of the above-mentioned calculation it was de- 
termined at what distances a 12 C.P. lamp must be set in order 
to illumine the text with the following intensities, .2, .3, .4, .5, 
6, .7, .8, .9, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0. The calculations are 
shown in Chart 35. 
The standardized lamp was obtained from the Nela Re- 
search Laboratory, Cleveland. The intensity of the lamp was 
kept constant within a small error by regulating the current by 
means of a voltmeter and a sliding resistance coil.

  The legibility of the print under each intensity of illumina- 
tion was measured by the distance at which it could be read. 
The distance of the text from the reader was varied by sliding the 
carriage along the track and making successive trials until the 
farthest point was reached at which 12 out of 15 letters could be 
read. This was then taken as the threshold of legibility for that 
intensity. In this way the legibility curve, or the curve of in- 
crease in legibility with increase in illumination was determined. 
In order to minimize eye fatigue in the readers the letters 
were exposed by threes for a limited period of time and a rest 
interval was given between exposures. There were 15 letters on 
each card, as shown in the following figure.

Twenty cards were used in succession, each having a different 
arrangement of the letters from the others. 
THE CURVE oF LEGIBILITY WITH ADULTS 
The first division of the experiment consisted in finding the 
curve of legibility, for the intensities of illumination above-men- 
tioned, for ten adults. 
The curves are shown in Chart 36.

  A composite curve was also constructed by averaging the dis- 
tances at which the text could be read by the ten readers under 
each intensity. These curves are to be interpreted as follows. 
The vertical scale on the left of each curve represents the distance
-P-A-G-E-105
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 95 
in feet of the reading text from the subject’s eye. The horizontal 
scale at the bottom represents the intensity of illumination in 
foot-candles. Beginning at the left the curves represent the in- 
crease in the distance at which the letters can be read, or the in- 
crease in legibility, with the increase in intensity of illumination. 
For example, the composite curve shows that for the group as a 
whole the legibility increases rapidly with the increase in illumina- 
tion up to one foot-candle and slowly above one foot-candle. 
In order to determine whether the rise in the legibility curve 
was due in part or in whole to practice two curves were established 
by beginning with the higher intensities of illumination. No 
difference in the form of the curves appeared. 
The ‘striking fact about these curves is their similarity in 
general form. In most of the individual cases there is a very 
rapid increase in legibility with increasing intensities up to about 
one foot-candle, and a much slower increase beyond that point. 
The variations among individuals are mainly in the general height 
of the curve or the distance in general at which the texts can be 
read. There is also some difference in the illumination intensity 
at which the rapid increase in legibility ceases. In some cases the 
break comes before one foot-candle and in some cases after. But 
in all cases there is a decided break at about this point. So far as 
legibility in the abstract goes it would appear that the returns 
from an increase in illumination much beyond one foot-candle 
rapidly diminish. Another break comes at about 2.5 foot-candles 
and beyond this point the returns diminish still more rapidly. 
CURVES OF LEGIBILITY WITH CHILDREN 
But we must not be hasty in applying the results of this first 
phase of the study. Several qualifying factors need to be investi- 
gated. On several of these factors we have some data. In the 
first place, it is necessary to compare the reactions of children to 
different degrees of illumination with those of adults. We have 
not yet carried this and the succeeding phases of the experiment 
as far as they must ultimately be carried, but the curves which 
are shown in Chart 37 from six children of 8 to 12 years of age 
indicate that the illumination requirements of young children 
are radically different from those of older children and of adults.

    Younger children reach the point of maximum legibility 
much more slowly than do adults and substantial returns from an 
increased intensity of illumination continue to higher intensities 
of illumination in young children than in adults. The case of the 
child who is represented by the middle curve on the right is a 
peculiar one which has no parallel among the adults and for which 
no adequate explanation has been found. The study of the il- 
lumination requirements for young children in comparison to 
those of older persons demands more extensive investigation and 
promises important practical consequences. 
SPEED OF READING UNDER DIFFERENT INTENSITIES 
The measure of legibility which has thus far been used is 
one which has important advantages for the purpose of experi- 
mentation because it is relatively accurate. Reading individual 
letters is not, however, a type of reading which is commonly de- 
manded and the question arises whether it is a good representative
-P-A-G-E-107
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 97 
of reading in general so far as the matter of legibility is concerned. 
In order to get an answer to this question, tests were made in 
which legibility was measured by the speed at which lists of words 
could be read. In this way speed of reading was tested under 
different intensities of illumination. Ten lists of words were 
first standardized to insure that the speed at which the ten lists 
could be read was approximately equal. 
The speed at which the ten lists were read by fifteen indi- 
viduals and the average speed for all the individuals on each list 
are shown in Chart 38.

Five of the lists are read in the same time within .1 second, 
and extreme difference is .3 second, which is 7% of the average 
time. The difference between the average time of reading of the 
first 5 lists and the second 5 lists is only .05 second. These 2 
groups are compared in the test of the effect of illumination in- 
tensity on the speed of reading. 
Chart 39 gives the results of the test in which 5 persons read 
5 of the lists under an illumination of .5 foot-candles and 5 other 
lists under an illumination of 5 foot-candles. The lists which

  were read under the higher illumination were not read more rapid- 
ly than those which were read under the lower illumination. There 
is, however, a large difference in the legibility of letters under 
these two intensities as measured by the distance at which they 
can be read. The distance at which letters can be read appears. 
therefore to be a more sensitive measure of legibility than the 
speed of reading, and the degree of illumination which meets the 
requirements of this test of the legibility of letters will satisfac- 
torily meet the reading requirement in general. 
EFFECT OF DIFFERENT INTENSITIES ON FATIGUE 
It is quite conceivable that an intensity of illumination which 
is sufficient to enable one to meet a severe legibility test might 
still be unsatisfactory because it entailed undue eye fatigue after 
prolonged reading under the given illumination intensity. Ac- 
   
-P-A-G-E-109
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 99° 
cordingly the fatigue effect was tested by having the subject read 
continuously for a given period under a low intensity of illumina- 
tion and then establishing the legibility curve and comparing it 
with the curve of the same subject under ordinary conditions. 
The test was carried out under several intensities. The results 
of these tests are shown in Chart 40. The tests were all made on 
the same person. The measurements upon which the curves on 
the left side of the figure are based were taken after the subject 
had read for one hour or an hour and a half under an illumination 
of 4% or 1 foot candle. For example, the broken line represents 
the legibility curve which was secured after the subject had read 
for 114 hours under an illumination of 14 foot-candle. The con- 
tinuous line represents the legibility curve after the same period 
of reading with 1 foot-candle illumination. These curves may be: 
compared with the broken line curve in the right hand figure, 
which represents a test made without previous reading under low 
illumination.

{t is evident that as much as 11% hours continuous reading 
under 1 foot-candle illumination does not produce evidence of 
eye fatigue as measured by a lowering of the legibility curve. 
Reading for 14% hours under 1% foot-candle appears to have no 
effect on the legibility curve up to 214 foot-candles but from that 
point on some lowering of the curve appears. 
On the right side of the figure are represented 2 additional 
fatigue tests. The dotted line represents the legibility curve

established after 214 hours continuous reading under 14 foot- 
candle illumination. This curve is sufficiently below that of the 
unfatigued eye to indicate that 14 foot-candle is not sufficient to 
permit prolonged reading without fatigue. 
The continuous line represents the same conditions as the 
broken line except that the test was made with adaptation to 1 
foot-candle. This seems to be slightly favorable. 
The experiment with fatigue demands more extended elabora- 
tion but the indications thus far are that fatigue is not a factor 
which demands much if any higher degree of illumination than is 
demanded on the ground of legibility itself. 
EFFECT OF ADAPTATION TO DIFFERENT INTENSITIES 
The legibility curve was first worked out in a darkened room 
with the illumination so far as possible confined to the text to be 
read. This was done in order that the effect of the general illumin- 
ation of the room might at first be eliminated and then later 
studied systematically. It is the general opinion that an increase 
in the general surrounding illumination reduces the legibility 
effect of a particular intensity of illumination of the printed page 
and necessitates that it receive a higher illumination than it would 
require with a lower general illumination. This variation of the 
sensitivity of the eye with varying degrees of general illumination 
is termed adaptation. For the purpose of testing this hypothesis 
the legibility curve was worked out with four adults under several 
degrees of general illumination. 
The method of controlling the general illumination indepen- 
dent of the illumination of the text was to enclose the subject 
in a light-proof compartment within which the lighting could be 
varied. A small opening was left in the enclosure through which 
the subject could see the reading matter. The compartment was 
lighted by an incandescent lamp, the light intensity of which was 
controlled by a sliding resistance coil in circuit with it. The 
illumination within the compartment was measured at the height 
of the subject’s eye by means of an illuminometer. 
By means of this arrangement the legibility was worked 
out for 3 adults under general adaptation to 1 foot-candle and 7 
foot-candles, and for 1 adult under a general adaptation of 14, 5, 
10 and 25 foot-candles. The results are shown in Chart 41.
-P-A-G-E-111
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 101 
CHART 41 
  The curves of legibility show rather surprisingly little effect 
of adaptation. In the case of the 3 subjects who were treated 
alike there is practically no difference between the dark adapta- 
tion curve and the curve under an adaptation to 7 foot-candles 
when the illumination of the text is more than 1 foot-candle. 
Singularly enough the ability to read a text illuminated by 1 foot- 
candle or more seems to be greater when the eye is adapted to 7 
foot-candles than when it is adapted to 1 foot-candle. When the 
reading matter is illuminated with an intensity below 1 foot-can- 
dle, adaptation seems to have greater effect. 
The results with the last subject, who was tested under four 
degrees of adaptation, are still more remarkable. For him the 
ability to read the text when it is illuminated above 14 foot-candle 
appears to be greater under all degrees of adaptation to general 
illumination varying from 14 to 25 foot-candles than under dark 
adaptation. This individual had been the subject of several of
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
the previous tests and it is possible that he was beginning to learn 
the order of letters on the cards, though there were 20 of them. 
Even though we discount these results on this account, however, 
the adaptation to surrounding general illumination appears to be 
a less important factor than we should expect in view of common 
observation. 
ScHOOL TESTS UNDER DIFFERENT INTENSITIES 
Since the laboratory experiment might not faithfully report 
all of the conditions of the school room which may conceivably 
affect the child’s efficiency under different degrees of illumination, 
a school room test was made to supplement this laboratory study. 
Chart 42 presents part of the results of this school room test. 
The tests consisted in asking the children to cross out letters 
from a sheet on which all the letters of the alphabet were printed 
in miscellaneous order. They were first asked to cross out the 
letters @ and e on one sheet, and with the lighting of the room so 
adjusted as to secure a low illumination of about 1 foot-candle 
in the middle of the room. Then the second sheet was given 
them, the illumination was altered to a medium illumination of 
about 3 foot-candles and they were asked to cross out the letters 
o and iz. In half of the rooms the low illumination was used first 
and in the other half the high illumination came first. This would 
equalize differences between the two tests due to differences in 
the difficulty of the tests or to practice. It will be seen from the 
table that the conditions of the test in grades 4b and 4a differed 
only in the order in which the low illumination was given. In 
4b, in which the low illumination came second, there was a loss 
of 11 in the number of letters crossed, and an increase of 2 errors, 
in the second test. In grade 4a in which the high illumination 
came second the loss was not quite so great. In grades 7b and 7a, 
on the other hand, the loss was somewhat greater in 7b in which 
the high illumination came second. This school test tends, there- 
fore, to confirm the conclusion from the laboratory experiment 
that an illumination somewhat below the standard may be ample 
for reading requirements. 
We may now sum up the results of the investigation and in- 
dicate its limitations and the extensions which should be made. 
In the case of adults the legibility of print increases very rapidly

with an increase in artificial illumination from .2 to 1 foot-candle, 
and much more slowly from 1 to 2.5 foot-candles. In the case of 
children of 8 and 10 years of age the increase in legibility is more 
gradual and continues to be marked up to 3. foot candles.

  Speed of reading does not appear to be so delicate a test as 
does the legibility test and the legibility test is probably adequate 
for the purposes of the experiment. 
The fatigue tests were made after reading with illumination 
intensities of 14 and 1 foot-candles. Only the trial in which the 
subject read 234 hours with 1% foot-candle produced evidence of 
fatigue. 
When the test is illuminated with an intensity of 1 foot-can- 
dle or more the adaptation of the eye to a higher general surround- 
ing illumination appears to have very little effect upon the ability 
to read. 
The school room test indicated that the difference in illumina- 
tion between 1 foot and 3 foot candles probably does not have a 
marked effect upon efficiency in reading. 
The trend of the foregoing results is to indicate a necessity 
for modest requirements only of artificial illumination. So far 
as they go they indicate that the standards of the Illuminating 
Engineering Society are higher than necessary in the case of older 
 
-P-A-G-E-114

children and adults. This conclusion, however, is advanced for 
the present only provisionally. The investigation should be ex- 
tended in the following directions: 
1 The legibility curve for a larger number of children of 
each age should be worked out. 
2 The fatigue test should be made with more subjects and a 
greater variety of lengths of reading period and degrees of illumin- 
ation. 
3 The tests for fatigue and for adaptation should be made 
with children. 
4 The effect of higher degrees of illumination should be 
studied. 
5 The possible effect of practice on the legibility curve 
should be tested with children. 
6 The experiment should be repeated under day-light il- 
‘lumination. This will of necessity be much less accurate than 
the study with artificial light but it must be done before an 
application of the results to conditions of day-light illumination 
can be made with assurance. 
The province of this study has been to study the amount of 
light required for reading. For an ultimate solution of light 
requirements the effect of different intensities of illumination on 
the feeling or emotional tone should also be taken into considera- 
tion, and should probably be made the subject of direct experi- 
mentation. 
This experiment has dealt only with the question of the 
intensity of illumination which is required. The practical question 
as to how to plan buildings so that the required illumination 
shall be obtained is a distinct one and requires an entirely new 
investigation. 
THE RELATION OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 
TO ILLUMINATION REQUIREMENTS 
The study of the second phase of the general problem is 
being carried on in two ways. In the first place a survey is being 
made of the illumination in existing buildings. This will make
-P-A-G-E-115
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 105 
it possible to see how much light is secured under various com- 
binations of window-floor-area ratio, height of windows in com- 
parison to width of room, the direction in which the window faces 
or the orientation, the color of the walls and the amount of black- 
board space, the presence of buildings or trees which obstruct 
the light on the outside, the time of day, season, weather condi- 
tions, and latitude. To these considerations must be added the 
determination of the difference in illumination in different parts 
of the room. 
The difficulty with this form of investigation is that there 
are so many complicating factors in any particular situation 
that it is difficult to assign to each factor its due importance. 
In order to study some of these factors in isolation, a model room 
has been constructed which can be illuminated from without by 
artificial light and in which such factors as the size and illumina- 
tion of the window space and the color of the walls and the effect 
of different positions in the room can be studied conveniently. 
A specimen of the type of comparison which can be made 
by the survey of school buildings is represented in Chart 43.

In the second to the sixth columns of Chart 43 are shown a 
number of the conditions which effect the light and in the last 
three columns are given the amount of illumination in foot-candles 
found under these conditions. Three measurements were made 
in each room, one on a desk near a window, the second in the 
middle of the room, and the third on a desk somewhat remote 
from the window. 
We may first compare the illumination in rooms which face 
toward different points of the compass. Compare in this manner 
rooms A B D and E, which are quite similar in other respects 
than this. In the afternoon it is clear that the west room is the 
lightest and that the east room is the darkest. The north room 
is lighter than the east room and practically as light as the south 
room. The north room seems to be at very little disadvantage 
as compared to the others. If this conclusion is confirmed it will 
have an important bearing upon the arrangement of school rooms. 
Another comparison may be made between the lighting on a rainy 
and a clear day. This may be done for the rooms A to E. There 
appears to be an unimportant diminution in the illumination of 
the brighter parts of the room but a more serious falling off on 
the dark desks. 
This calls attention to the great difference that exists between 
the amount of light in the different parts of the room. This dif- 
ference raises what appears to be one of the most serious problems 
in the field. It is one to which a large amount of attention will 
be given in the further prosecution of the investigation. 
These serve merely as illustrations of the type of com- 
parisons that are being made. The purpose is to evaluate the 
various factors mentioned at the beginning of the description of 
this phase of the experiment and to determine which factors are 
the most important with a view to laying down certain broad 
requirements necessary to secure the desired illumination. 
Part II. The Lighting Situation in School Buildings. 
The aims of the study fall under two general heads. The 
first question, which has already been attacked, concerns the 
amount of light necessary for efficient reading. This question 
has to do with the investigation of the standard requirement of 
illumination for school buildings. The second question is: How 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  ‘SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 107 
is the standard requirement to be attained? What type of build- 
ing, what proportions of room, and what relation between glass 
area and floor area are adapted to secure the required amount of 
light. 
A report upon the first feature of the investigation has already 
been made. It may be summarized very briefly. The method 
for studying the light requirement for reading was to determine 
how reading efficiency falls off when light is diminished below an 
adequate intensity by certain definite amounts. The subjects 
comprised both children and adults. They were asked to read 
letters which were illuminated by different amounts of light, 
ranging from .2 foot-candle to 5 foot-candles. The efficiency of 
the reading under these different intensities was tested by meas- 
uring the distance at which the text could be read, and the re- 
sults are shown in summary form on Chart 44. Each of these

curves is the average from records of eight to sixteen individuals. 
The intensities are represented along the base line and the distance 
at which the text was read along the vertical dimension. If we 
start from the right end of each curve, we see that, as the light is 
reduced, a point is reached at which legibility begins to diminish 
by a noticeable degree. This decrease becomes more and more  
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
rapid as we approach the lower intensities. The curve for adults 
shows that there is a noticeable falling off in efficiency beginning 
at 3 foot-candles and a very marked falling off below the 1 foot- 
candle. The excess of illumination above 3 foot-candles seems to 
add very little, if any, to the efficiency of reading. The curves 
from three groups of children show the breaking point at about 
the same intensity. One difference between children’s curves 
and that of adults is that the children’s curves are lower, in- 
dicating, in all probability, that their ability to recognize letters 
is less well developed than that of adults. Furthermore, the curve 
for the youngest children, 8 and 9, shows a more uniform decline 
from the 3 foot-candle point to the lowest intensity. It would 
appear from this that it is somewhat more important that the 
younger children be furnished with the standard amount of light 
than is the case with older children. 
From these data, we may lay down the provisional standard 
of 3 foot-candles. 
The distinction is sometimes made between the requirement 
in daylight and artificial light. To test this question a number of 
individuals were also tested in daylight. The measurements 
were not quite so accurate, since daylight can not be controlled 
as well as artificial light. In general, the curves took the same 
form as the artificial light curves. The only important difference 
was that they were higher. Thus the point at which the reduction 
in intensity reduces efficiency of reading came at the same 
illumination in daylight as in artificial light, but subjects were 
able to read texts illuminated by daylight somewhat better. 
This seems to indicate that the standard for daylight need not be 
higher than that for artificial light. 
An observation of children at work in a school room makes 
it very clear that they frequently do not secure the entire avail- 
able amount of light upon their work. They may hold their 
books in such a way that they are partially shaded, or lean over 
their desks so that they obstruct the light. It is obvious that 
the amount of such a reduction must vary widely. In order to 
get some notion of what this amount may be, a test was made in 
eight school rooms. This test did not include all the children in 
the rooms, but only those whose work appeared to be somewhat 
shaded. The average percentage of the available illumination
-P-A-G-E-119
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 109 
which these selected children actually had on their work, varied 
from .41 to .80. This means that an appreciable percentage of 
the children get only about 60 per cent of the illumination avail- 
able. If we make allowance for this reduction, the amount of 
illumination that would be necessary to insure an intensity of 
3 foot-candles upon children’s work would be 5 foot-candles. 
This standard seems to be necessary, then, to allow a reasonable 
margin of safety. It is slightly less than the standard that the 
Illuminating Engineering Society has laid down as the minimum 
for daylight. This standard is 6 foot-candles. A survey of 
schools has shown, however, that if this standard of 5 foot-candles 
were universally attained, the prevailing light situation would 
have to be considerably improved. 
How Must BUILDINGS BE CONSTRUCTED SO AS TO SECURE 
STANDARD ILLUMINATION? 
A survey of school buildings was next made for the purpose 
of finding out what the situation is with reference to the attain- 
ment of the lighting standard. This survey was made for the 
purpose of finding out what variations occur among different 
buildings and what conditions are responsible for these variations. 
In order to cover different types of buildings and to secure some 
variety, tests were made in the cities of Chicago, St. Louis, Cleve- 
land, Evanston, Winnetka and a few rural schools of Cook County, 
Illinois. Earlier tests with an inadequate instrument were also 
made in Springfield and Rockford, Illinois, but the results are not 
used because of the inaccuracy of the measurements. 
In addition to these tests in a variety of places, a series of 
tests was made in one school building under different conditions 
of weather, season, and time of day. 
The crucial question of the study is: Under what conditions 
does deficiency in light approach the danger line and how may 
we be assured that the amount of light will be above this line? 
We may first examine the situation in what may be called an 
ordinary standard room. The first fact that strikes our attention 
in examining the results of the tests, is that there is tremendous 
variation in the intensity of light. Among the buildings which 
were tested, the illumination on the brightest desk in the room
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
varied from 438.53 to 1.79 foot-candles. On the middle desk in 
the room the highest intensity found was 95.43 and the lowest 
.64 foot-candles. On the darker side of the room, the variation 
was from 49.57 to .25 foot-candles.

          This large variation, of course, is not produced chiefly by the 
difference in the construction of the buildings. A very important 
cause of the variation is the season of the year. Some estimate 
of the effect of the season may be obtained from Chart 45. This
-P-A-G-E-121
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 111 
shows a series of measurements made in the same building on 
June 20th and on November 3rd. The reduction in illumination 
in the winter on the middle desks of four rooms averaged 49 per 
cent. The reduction on the dark desks in these rooms averaged 
40 per cent. A building must, therefore, be so constructed that 
it will get adequate illumination in the darker season of the year. 
Another factor of variation is the time of day. In Chart 46: 
which is constructed similarly to Chart 45 the percentage of 
reduction, three hours after noon, is 60 per cent. and 34 per cent.. 
in the two series of measurements respectively. 
There is also a large reduction on a dull day as compared! 
with a bright day, but it would be difficult to make an estimate 
of this amount on account of the impossibility of defining standard 
types of weather. 
These variations are independent of the construction of the 
buildings and have to be taken into account in adjusting the 
construction so that the illumination will be adequate, not only 
under favorable, but also under relatively unfavorable conditions. 
The most commonly recognized factor of importance in 
constructing buildings so as to secure adequate illumination, is 
the ratio of the glass area to the floor area. The effect of different 
proportions of glass area is illustrated by the comparison of the 
two buildings which is shown in Chart 47. These two buildings 
were in the same city and were tested on the same day under 
approximately the same weather conditions and at nearly the 
same time of day. Measurements are shown taken in the four 
rooms of each building, facing towards four points of the compass 
and on three desks in each room. At the bottom of the table 
is shown the ratio of the glass area in two rooms and of the illumin- 
ation on the desks. The glass area in the first room is about two- 
thirds of that in the second. 
On the brighter desks this difference in area has little effect 
upon the relative illumination. The reduction in illumination in 
the room having the smaller amount of glass area is greater as 
we go towards the darker parts of the room, than is the reduction 
in the better illuminated room. This fact is shown clearly by the 
relationship represented in the last column, to which we shall 
have occasion to refer again. In this column is shown, for each

of the room. The ratio in the better illuminated room is about 
double that in the more poorly illuminated room. Obviously,

        the reduction in illumination by an inadequate glass area is 
greatest at the point at which it can least be afforded, namely, in 
the darker parts of the room. 
The same situation appears when we study the effect of 
lowering shades in the room. There are certain cases in which 
no detriment results from lowered shades. The danger point to 
be watched when shades are lowered, however, may be seen from
-P-A-G-E-124
114 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
Chart 48. This shows a comparison between the average illumina- 
tion in a variety of schools when the shades are up and when 
they are down. The effect is to lower the ratio between the dark 
and bright desk. Again it is the darker side of the room which 
suffers, 
The result of lowering the shades is particularly prejudicial 
to the illumination in the darker side of the room, not because 
it reduces the general amount of illumination but because it 
reduces it at the wrong point. The effect of reducing the window 
area by alternately lowering shades at the top and raising them at 
the bottom, was studied in a model experimental room. This 
room was illuminated by diffuse artificial light so as to simulate 
conditions of daylight illumination. The results of the test are 
shown on Chart 49,—A. On the left of the chart (1) is shown the 
result of lowering shades from the top. The two narrow columns 
represent the relative illumination of the brighter and the darker 
parts of the room. Thus, lowering the shades from the top re- 
duces the illumination on the dark side more than on the light 
side. The opposite effect is shown on the right hand side of the 
chart (2) from raising the shades from the bottom. Here it ap- 
pears that the reduction of the light at the dark side is less than 
that at the light side of the room. 
The ratio between the illumination on the dark side and the 
brighter side of the room is one of the most important measures 
to be considered. The attainment of a comparatively large ratio 
is one of the chief desiderata of construction. The tremendous 
variation in this ratio, then, even in buildings constructed ac- 
cording to the conventional plan, is important. We have already 
seen that larger amounts of glass area raise this ratio. In the 
cases which were measured, the lowest ratio found was .027 and 
the highest under normal conditions .296. In other words, the 
highest ratio was about ten times the lowest. 
With the view to special study of the evenness of illumination 
throughout the room, tests were made in two examples of build- 
ings constructed with skylight illumination. In these buildings 
the variation in illumination in different parts of the room was 
less than in the typical building of ordinary construction. We 
may compare measurements made in one of these buildings with 
those in an up-to-date school building of the ordinary type, made

Cleveland, the illumination was by skylight. The ratio of the dark 
to light desk in this room was .362, and the average of the other 
rooms in the school was .116. It is clear that skylight illumina- 
tion may give an evener distribution of light than the unilateral

room which was illuminated by skylight, supplemented by win- 
dows, the variation throughout the room was somewhat greater. 
In these measurements it averaged .246. In this building the 
arrangement of the light was somewhat different from the other. 
In the first there was no window light in the ceiling but the light 
came directly into the room from a skylight in the roof. The side 
walls of the opening to the roof sloped outward and allowed light
-P-A-G-E-128
118 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
to spread towards the sides of the room. In order to avoid glare 
large adjustable shutters were placed just above the level of the 
ceiling. This building was constructed after the other one and 
represents an improved type. In considering the value of sky- 
lights the difficulty of keeping them clean must be kept in mind. 
We have been led to fix attention upon the unevenness in the 
illumination of the different parts of the room as constituting the 
most serious problem of lighting. The situation is represented 
graphically in Chart 50. This curve represents the actual illumin- 
ation at successive two foot intervals in a room lighted by windows 
on one side. It will be seen that the illumination falls off in regu- 
lar fashion. Allowing for errors of observation the percentage 
of reduction at uniform distances is constant until the opposite 
wall is approached. For our purpose, however, we may consider 
the proportion of falling off to be constant. This means that in 
the present instance, every four feet from the window represents 
a reduction of 33% in illumination. Thus the amount of light at 
each point was only two-thirds of that at a point four feet nearer 
the window. Or to put it in another way, to move a desk four 
feet from the window reduces the illumination about one-third. 
This proportion, of course, varies with rooms of different shape . 
and window-floor area, but this represents a typical case. 
We may digress a moment to mention an incidental compar- 
ison which was made possible by the measurements of the school 
buildings. This comparison is shown in Chart 51. This figure 
shows a succession of records taken from four sides of a building. 
The average illumination of the rooms on the four sides is repre- 
sented at the bottom of the table. The average is approximately 
the same for the North and East rooms and is higher for the South 
and West. The superiority of the West room is to be explained 
by the fact that the majority of the readings were taken in the 
afternoon. So far as amount of illumination is concerned the 
North rooms were on a par with those on the East and West sides. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Taking 5 foot-candles as a standard requirement it is clear 
that even the buildings which were constructed in accordance 
with the prevailing standards of glass area give deficient illumina- 
tion in the darker parts of the room, under the less favorable

conditions of season, weather, and time of day. When the un- 
favorable conditions combine, the illumination may be ridicu- 
lously low. It may be safely said that in the winter season, the 
dark desks are inadequately lighted for a considerable part of 
the time. The brighter half or three-quarters of the room usually 
offers no problem. 
We may consider various possible methods for overcoming 
this difficulty. First, an absolute and relative illumination on 
the dark side of a room may be increased by increasing the height 
of the windows in proportion to the width of the room. This is 
made clear by a comparison of A and B on Chart 49. If this 
solution is resorted to, it may be necessary to increase the height 
of the ceilings beyond reasonable standards. This increase in 
the height of the ceilings greatly increases the cubic space of the 
room. It secures much greater light than is necessary on the 
brighter side of the room and from the point of view of construc- 
tion is a wasteful method of meeting the problem. 
The second solution consists in decreasing the width of the 
room and keeping the same height of ceiling and increasing the 
length of the room. This would be another method of attaining 
the same proportions as by increasing the height of the ceiling 
and keeping the depth of the room constant. Rooms of excessive 
length make teaching difficult and increase the cost of corridors 
and outside walls. 
It is obvious that increasing the height of a room in compari- 
son to the depth gives proportionate increase in cubic space. It 
is also true that construction of the large rooms, which are typical 
in a modern school, involves excess cubic space even if the ceiling 
is raised only in proportion to the increase in the width of the 
room. We may assume that with whatever size of room, there 
will be a certain minimum height of ceiling. With this height 
will go a depth of room which will give an adequate illumination. 
If the room is made deeper than this it will necessitate propor- 
tionate increase in the height of the ceiling and this will be ac- 
companied by a proportionate increase in cubic space. Therefore, 
unilateral illumination in so far as it involves increasing the height 
of the ceiling beyond reasonable heights necessitates increase in 
the cubic contents of a room.
-P-A-G-E-131
  
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 121 
A third solution is to find some method of diffusing light 
toward the back of the room. Some use has been made of ribbed 
glass for this purpose in school rooms, as well as in other com- 
mercial and industrial buildings. The development of some such 
means as this for diffusing the light offers promising possibilities 
for meeting the illumination problem. 
Fourth, the use of skylight illumination has already been com- 
mented upon. Where the other building demands make it possi- 
ble it is a satisfactory arrangement so far as the effect in securing 
evenness of illumination is concerned. Whether skylight illumin- 
ation produces injurious glare has not been inquired into in this 
study. There are other questions, however, that must be met in 
determining upon the construction of the one story building and 
this therefore, cannot be said to be a universally applicable solu- 
tion. 
In the fifth place, if other solutions fail, it is possible to sup- 
plement daylight illumination by means of artificial light on the 
darker side of the room. In buildings already constructed it is 
safe to say that such artificial light should in all cases be installed. 
Sixth, it is possible to increase the illumination at the dark 
side by the use of surfaces which reflect a large amount of light. 
The ceiling may be made almost if not entirely white. It is pos- 
sible that there may be satisfactorily substituted for the black- 
board a surface of greater reflecting power. 
Finally a word should be said in regard to the use of window 
shades. In many of the rooms tested the shades were found to 
be drawn down and the illumination to be deficient. When the 
shades were raised the illumination was found to be satisfactory. 
In many of these cases there was no direct sunshine in the room 
and it was not necessary to have the shades drawn down. It is, 
therefore, necessary that the teachers be instructed on the pos- 
sible harm of drawing down the shades and that their practice 
in this matter be watched.

National Fire Protection Association. 
Part II SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS 
The National Fire’ Protection Association has given pro- 
longed study to the specific requirements for safety to life that 
should be observed in the planning and construction of every 
school building. 
The following are certain of the requirements adopted as 
essential by a committee of that Association. 
The fundamental principles of these requirements are to 
provide exits sufficient to vacate school buildings promptly after 
the alarm of fire has been given, and to provide for construction 
such that buildings may be vacated without danger to life by 
fire, smoke or resulting panic. 
Two stories shall be the maximum height of buildings of non- 
fire-resistive construction. 
The basement (or ground story) shall be considered a story 
if the ceiling is 714 feet or more above the grade level at any 
point next to the building. 
Note: This is to prevent evasion of requirements e. g. by designating as 
“two story and basement” a building which from a life safety standpoint is really 
a three-story building.  
-P-A-G-E-134
  124 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
Buildings of more than two, but not more than four stories 
shall have fire-resistive floors, walls and partitions, but trim, 
finish floor, sash, doors and frames may be of wood. 
The interior wall and ceiling finish in buildings of more than 
one story and in one-story buildings if basements are used or 
usable for any purpose other than the heating plant, where hollow 
wood studded wall and partition construction is used, shall be 
plaster, or other finish equally smoke-tight and fire retardant. 
All basement walls and partitions shall be of fire-resistive 
construction. 
All heating plants within school buildings, including fuel 
storage rooms, shall be completely surrounded by fire-resistive 
enclosures with self-closing fire doors protecting all openings 
thereto, except those in exterior walls. Ceiling construction 
above these rooms shall be fire resistive. 
The first floor should preferably be entirely of fire-resistive 
construction. 
Doors from basements leading to stairs, corridors or other 
lines of exit (except doors to the outside) shall be self-closing and 
of metal or metal-covered. 
Wood or other combustible finish shall cover only minor por- 
tions of the wall surface and where used shall have plaster or 
equivalent backing (e.g. wood wainscoting prohibited). All hol- 
low spaces in wood stud walls or partitions shall be fire-stopped at 
floor lines with incombustible material. Board floors on wood joists 
shall be double with fire retarding felt or paper between layers. 
In buildings of two stories or more all glass between rooms 
and corridors shall be wired glass. 
Auditoriums shall not be located above the first story nor 
be below the grade at any exit and in any case shall so be placed 
that all of the required independent exits (not including balcony 
exits) shall afford egress with a vertical descent of not more than 
15 feet to the ground. 
Gymnasiums if used for auditorium purposes shall conform 
to requirements for auditoriums. 
Light wells are not recommended. If provided, they shall 
be open at the top. If less than 10 feet in least dimension, they
-P-A-G-E-135
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 125 
shall be enclosed by fire-resistive walls and shall have wired glass 
windows in stationary metal frames. 
Elevator and dumb waiter shafts shall be constructed of 
fire-resistive materials and all openings shall be provided with 
approved fire doors. 
Number and Location of Extis 
The term “‘exit’”’ as here used, means a way of egress secured 
through one or more openings leading out of doors either directly, 
through a stairway, or through a way of access to such an open- 
ing or stairway, which way is protected by a smokestop. 
Not less than two inside stairs or smokeproof towers, remote 
from each other, shall be provided from every floor, including 
basements. 
Exits shall so be arranged with respect to corridors, passages 
and stairwells that there are no pockets or dead ends in which 
pupils might be trapped. 
Exits shall so be located that at least one stairway or other 
exit will be within 100 feet (measured along the line of travel) 
of the corridor exit door of every room. 
In buildings of non fire-resistive construction every room 
above the first floor with capacity of over twenty pupils (400 
square feet) shall have at least two means of egress. In case these 
egresses finally open upon the same corridor, the openings into 
the corridor shall be on opposite sides of a smoke-resistive door, 
and shall give access to independent stairways. 
Corridors and Stairways. 
Corridors shall be at least 8 feet wide in the clear. Doors 
of lockers shall not project into this 8 feet clear width at any 
point during their swing. 
All stairs, platforms, landings, balconies, and stair hallways 
shall be of sufficient strength to sustain safely a live load of not 
less than 100 pounds per square foot with a factor of safety of 4. 
All stairs shall have treads and risers of uniform width and 
height throughout each flight from the lowest to the topmost story. 
The space beneath any stairway, built in whole or in part 
of combustible material, shall be completely enclosed without 
door or other opening. 
Note. This is to prohibit closets and similar spaces under stairs. It is not 
to be interpreted to prohibit an enclosed flight of stairs beneath another flight.
-P-A-G-E-136
  126 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
No arrangement of treads known as winders shall be per- 
mitted in any stairways to be used by the pupils. 
Stairways and intermediate landings shall continue with no 
decrease in width along the direction of exit travel. 
All stairways shall lead by a direct line of travel to the street 
floor and open directly on the street or to an open-air or fire- 
resistive passage leading to the street or to a yard or court con- 
nected with the street. 
Stairs and other exits shall so be located and marked that 
they are readily accessible and visible to the occupants of the 
building. 
Doors giving access to stairways must swing with the exit 
travel. There shall be no obstruction to doors on stairs or land- 
ings to prevent a swing of at least ninety degrees. 
No door shall open immediately onto a flight of stairs, but a 
space of at least the width of the door shall be provided between 
stairs and door. 
Doors from stairways to outside the building shall swing 
out and so be arranged as not to restrict the effective width of the 
stairs. 
All stairs shall have walls or well-secured balustrades or 
guards on both sides and shall have handrails on both sides. Any 
stairway over 66 inches in width shall be provided with one or 
more continuous intermediate handrails substantially supported; 
the number and positions of intermediate handrails to be such 
that there will be not more than 66 inches between adjacent 
handrails. 
Handrails approximately 33 inches above the forward edge 
of tread (measured in line with the face of the riser) shall be 
provided on both sides of stairs. Construction shall be such that 
there will be no obstructions tending to break hand hold. 
Note. For schools which small children attend, it is advisable to provide 
additional handrails about twenty-seven ‘inches high. 
Every stairway or other exit and the corridors and passage- 
ways appurtenant thereto shall be provided with an adequate 
system of lighting. 
Stairs shall be at least 44 inches wide. All such widths shall 
be clear of all obstructions except that handrails attached to 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 127 
walls may project not more than 314 inches at each side within 
the required width. If newels project above tops of rails, a clear 
width of at least 44 inches shall be provided between the face of 
the newel and the face of the wall or newel opposite. The rise 
of stairs shall be not more than 7 inches, and the tread exclusive 
of the nosing be not less than 1014 inches. Stairways exceeding 
10 feet in height shall have an intermediate landing. 
Units of stair width shall be 22 inches. 
The minimum headroom at all points on stairs shall be 7 
feet 6 inches measured vertically. 
Red lights shall be provided at all exits leading to outside 
stairs. Two independent sources of light should preferably be 
provided. 
Stair Enclosure. 
The stairs, landings, platforms, and passageways connected 
therewith, shall be completely enclosed by fire resistive walls or 
partitions substantially constructed of brick not less than 8 inches 
thick or of reinforced concrete not less than six inches thick or of 
other construction and material having equivalent fire resistance. 
“Monumental” stairs (as used in public buildings, stores, 
etc.) leading from the street floor to the second floor (or the base- 
ment), which do not constitute required means of exit, are ex- 
empted from stairway enclosure requirements provided that they 
are effectively cut off at the second floor (or basement) by parti- 
tions having fire resistance at least equal to that of the required 
stair enclosure. 
Note. Such partitions need not be immediately at the head or foot of the 
stairs, but when located away from the stairs the space between stairs and par- 
tition shall not be used for any other purpose than as a passageway to or from the 
stairs, 
Horizontal Exits. 
A horizontal exit consists of one or more protected openings 
through or around a fire exit partition. 
Note. Asa means of rapid and safe egress from a burning building, the use 
of horizontal exits is strongly recommended. 
No openings serving as a horizontal exit shall be less than 
30 inches and preferably not more than 88 inches in width or 
more than 80 square feet in area. 
Every horizontal exit for which credit is given shall so be 
     
-P-A-G-E-138
  128 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
arranged that there are continuously available paths of travel 
leading from each side of the exit to stairways or other standard 
means of egress leading to outside the building. 
RULES FOR DETERMINING REQUIRED EXITS. 
Exits from Upper Stories.

gymnasiums and exits provided accordingly, in addition to those 
required for the rest of the building. (See note below) 
H=Height (Number of stories.) 
Note, This provides exits in sufficient number to empty a three-story 
fire-resistive building with enclosed stairways in about three minutes at the 
rate of 45 persons per minute per unit of stair width, and assuming that one-third 
of the exits are not used, the population being determined as follows: 
Divide gross area by 2 to get net area used for educational purposes and 
divide by 20 to get number of occupants. (This provides for average population 
of most crowded schools as shown by counts of typical schools, and is in sub- 
stantial agreement with various state laws governing school construction.) 
Auditoriums and gymnasiums which may be used for auditorium purposes 
are figured separately on the basis of one person for each 6 sq. ft. of net floor area. 
Basement Exits. 
The basement (or “‘ground story’’) shall be treated the same 
as an upper story, except that for basements H =3, and exits 
shall be provided accordingly, either stairs leading to the first 
story or doors leading directly outdoors. 
First Floor Exit Doors. 
They shall be provided as follows: 
(a) One unit of door width (see p. 131) for each unit of stairs 
from upper floors. 
(b) One additional unit of door width for each unit of re- 
quired stairs from basement. 
(c) One additional unit of door width for each 5000 square 
feet or fraction thereof of gross area of the first floor. 
(d) One additional unit of door width for each 900 square 
feet or fraction thereof of floor area of auditoriums and gymna- 
siums on the first floor. 
Example: Assume a three story and basement fire-resistive 
building having stairs enclosed, no horizontal exits and no au- 
tomatic sprinkler protection, 60 feet x 125 feet (=7500 square 
feet per floor). Assume that there is an auditorium, 50 X 60 feet 
on the first floor. Assume that there are no independent exits 
from basement and that the occupants of the basement must 
use first floor exit doors. 
Stairs from upper stories will be, substituting in the formula: 
75003 
600X5x1x2 ~9%4- 
Therefore 2, 2-unit stairways will be required. Stairs from 
basement by a similar calculation (H =3 in each case) will be 2, 
2-unit stairways.

(d) To serve auditorium, a = 3.3,or 4 units 
Total street floor exit doors required = 14 units 
This street floor exit door requirement may be satisfied by 
providing 7, 40-in. doors or other equivalent arrangement. The 
doors (a) and (b) should be located at the stairs, the doors (d) 
should lead directly from the auditorium. The doors (c) may be 
at any conyenient location so disposed that the requirement for 
two ways out of every floor area will be satisfied. 
For auditoriums and for gymnasiums which may be used for 
auditorium purposes, exit facilities for the number of occupants 
shall be provided independent of those required for the other 
parts of the building, all in general conformity with the exits 
hereinbefore specified for other parts of the building. 
Every building shall be equipped with an approved fire alarm 
system. Signal gongs shall be placed on each floor, including 
basement, and shall be used for dismissal only, signals to be oper- 
ated by signal stations placed on each floor and also in the prin- 
cipal’s office. 
Every enclosed stairway or other exit and the corridors or 
passageways appurtenant thereto shall be provided with an ade- 
quate system of lighting in accordance with the A. E. S. C. 
Standard Code of Lighting School Buildings. 
' Doors 
Doors. Exterior doors shall be operated by bars or other 
panic hardware device. Single leaf doors rather than double 
are recommended because hardware now available is more satis- 
factory for single than double doors. If glass is used in doors, it 
shall be wired glass. 
Bars or other panic hardware device shall be of types that are 
applied to the surface of the door.
-P-A-G-E-141
  
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 131 
The bar or releasing device should extend for three-quarters 
of the width of the door at the latch side and should have a pro- 
jection of not more than 314 inches from the face of the door 
and the space between the bar and the door should be closed or 
filled with solid panel allowing not more than one inch between 
the back of the panel and the surface of the door. 
Upon this panel should be engraved or embossed in large 
letters ‘‘PUSH.” 
All required exit doors shall swing with the exit travel. 
All classroom and other doors used in connection with means 
of egress shall so be arranged as to be opened readily from the 
side from which egress is made. Locks, if provided, shall not 
require key to operate from the inside. 
Units of doorway width shall be 22 inches. Doorway open- 
ings less than two full units wide in the clear shall be rated as not 
more than one unit. 
A 30-inch door rates as one unit. A double doorway 66 
inches wide rates as three units if there is no mullion; if there is a 
mullion in the middle, the doorway rates as two units, for only 
two files of people can pass through it, whereas if there is no mul- 
lion it is assumed three files can pass through simultaneously. 
AISLES AND CORRIDORS 
Safe and continuous passageways, aisles or corridors leading 
directly to every exit and so arranged as to be conveniently ac- 
cessible to every occupant shall be maintained at all times on all 
floors. 
Widths of passageways, aisles or corridors shall be measured 
in the clear, at their narrowest points. 
The aggregate width of passageways, aisles or corridors 
leading to any exit shall be at least equal to the required width of 
the exit. Where all travel to any exit is along the passageway, 
such passageway shall have a width at least equal to the required 
width of the exit. 
The minimum width of any passageway shall be three feet 
in the clear. 
Note. These requirements have been extracted from the complete Build- 
ings Exit Code, which includes considerable additional detail not covered in this 
report. Copies of the complete code may be obtained from the National Fire 
Protection Association, 40 Central Street, Boston.

PREVENTION OF FIRE 
Fire prevention for existing buildings is mostly a matter of maintenance the es- 
sentials of which are, (1) Cleanliness, (2) Guarding (care and preparation to prevent 
fire), (3) Inspection, to keep up efficiency of exit and fire apparatus. 
Maintenance especially applies to Fire Hazards. Those called Common apply to 
property in general; the Special hazards pertain to the specific occupancy, school hazards. 
For proposed buildings fire prevention demands attention to (1) Location, to 
avoid fires from exposing buildings and to procure adequate public fire fighting facilities. 
(2) Construction. This involves consideration of all building laws, fire prevention rules, 
approved materials, co-operation with fire protection specialists and strict attention 
to all structural details. 
The chart indicates the specific items to be considered under the above outline.

SAFETY TO LIFE 
Maintenance and guarding of hazards are essential to Safety to Life and also apply 
as in Charts I and IT. 
Safety to the inmates of the school is entirely dependent on the following three 
essentials. 
(a) Fire Protection of the building, as specified in Chart II so that fires may be stopped 
before life is endangered. 
(b) Construction as specified in Chart I. Life safety is directly proportioned to the 
speed of burning For safety to life certain details of Exits need attention which 
are not essential to fire protection of the building. 
(c) Drills, maintained to rapidly and safely empty the building of all occupants. The 
high efficiency of the Drill is most essential in schools having defects in the other 
specifications outlined on the three charts.

CHAPTER X 
SPECIFICATIONS 
A specification as used for building construction and equip- 
ment should be a qualitative description of the materials, methods 
and workmanship, which, when assembled in orderly fashion in 
accordance with a studied arrangement as expressed in the draw- 
ings accompanying it, will produce a building structure or equip- 
ment that is economically constructed for efficient use. A speci- 
fication must be brief, concise, coherent, comprehensive without 
verbosity and an explicit statement of all elements necessary to 
the satisfactory accomplishment of the desired result. 
In almost all cases, an architectural specification is accom- 
panied by drawings that express, in a quantitative manner, the 
desire of their author in the fabrication, manufacture or con- 
struction of the structure or equipment. Thus the scope of any 
project is usually outlined by linear measurements and illustra- 
tions of architectural, structural or equipment requirements in 
the drawings and through description by the specifications so 
that the estimator, the contractor, the owner and all others con- 
cerned in the accomplishment of the work have available all the 
necessary data. 
The architect who is responsible for the design and construc- 
tion of a building must be intimately acquainted with a vast 
number of materials and processes and, as his knowledge of these 
and his skill in their use, are increased he finds his object more 
easy of accomplishment. The person who writes specifications 
for such structures must have a thorough knowledge of the sub- 
ject matter of the various sub-divisions of his specifications and 
since the average mortal cannot hope to learn, through personal 
experience, all he must know in order that he may achieve success, 
he must look to some source or sources of authoritative informa- 
tion for assistance. 
* Data for this Chapter contributed by the American Specification Institute. 
135
-P-A-G-E-146
  
136 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
Every specification comprises certain elements that are 
necessary in order to convey to the mind of the reader all funda- 
mentals that will govern in the execution of the work. Although 
it is not expressed in so many words, practically all specifications 
have been prepared with a view to the economic use of materials 
and methods, consistent with the component parts available to 
use and with the results that are considered most desirable. Eco- 
nomic values always must be considered, else the wasteful pro- 
cesses that will be encouraged by a disregard of such consideration 
will bring to the architect a reputation that will not be to his 
credit. 
Certain standards of excellence in workmanship or materials 
must be specified so accurately that there will be no question as 
to the aims of the author of the specifications. Likewise it is 
oftentimes necessary or desirable to present to the one who is to 
execute the work a choice of several alternative ways of accom- 
plishing the ends sought. In order that both of these elements 
may be provided for with scientific precision, it is necessary that 
the architect become acquainted with the standards and alterna- 
tives that are available for use and that are most desirable for any 
particular operation. The description of materials, methods and 
their use cannot be made in a brief, concise, coherent and accurate 
manner unless the one writing the specifications has, at his finger 
tips, all facts that will be of assistance to him in formulating his 
judgment. 
Another element of specifications is the use made of them as 
the instrument of instruction to all concerned as to how each 
step in the work is to be accomplished. Specifications should 
not only describe materials and methods but they should, in 
addition, instruct the men engaged in active construction or 
installation work as to the means by which the materials and 
methods are to be used in order that results will conform with 
those conceived in the mind of the architect. This element is 
intimately bound in with the general descriptive element of 
specifications, yet it should not be confused with it. 
All specifications for building and for many classes of equip- 
ment or co-related operations must be accompanied by general 
contract conditions and instructions to bidders. It is rare to find 
these elements missing although they may not have been given 
sufficient consideration to give them prominence.
-P-A-G-E-147
  
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 137 
Specifications may be divided into four classes in so far as their 
contents are concerned. These classes are materials, methods, 
construction and equipment. Many specifications and, in fact. 
most specifications that are used in building combine three of 
these four elements, that is to say, the specifications will embrace 
materials, methods and construction while for the equipment 
there will be these same elements with a sub-element of installa- 
tion after shop construction. 
ELEMENTS OF A SPECIFICATION 
Every specification expresses a consideration of the following 
phases: legal, economic, descriptive, materials, methods, schedules, 
results. 
These phases may be sub-divided as follows:

1 Use the American Specification Institute outline. The use 
of this outline will help to avoid repetition, contradiction, 
omission or illogical arrangement. 
2 Specify or omit. Eliminate all clauses that reflect indecision 
or lack of knowledge. 
3 Use simple words. Do not use big words. The language of 
specifications must be within the comprehension of the 
ordinary foreman. Use technical words in their exact tech- 
' nical meaning. Do not use words that are subject to am- 
biguous interpretation. 
4 Use nouns. Do not use pronouns. It is better to repeat 
the nouns, even at the sacrifice of elegance. 
5 Use short sentences. Do not write long and involved sen- 
tences. 
6 Use commas sparingly. Do not construct sentences in such 
form that the omission, addition or misplacement of a comma 
will alter the sense. 
7 Make the language a clear and concise expression of just 
what is meant. Do not try for the effect of a flow of words.

CHAPTER XI 
ESTIMATING THE COST OF A BUILDING 
1 COMPUTING CUBICAL CONTENTS 
A Ascertain the cubical contents of the building by multiplying 
the area of the first floor by the height of the building from 
the underside of basement floor to the mean of the roof. 
B In buildings whose basements are not entirely excavated 
multiply the area of the first floor by the height of the build- 
ing from the underside of the first floor to the mean of the 
roof. To this content add the cubical content of any space 
between the underside of the first floor and the surface of 
the excavation, and in addition add the cubical contents of 
any partial basement which may be found in the building. 
When portions of the building are built to different heights, 
each portion is to be taken as an individual unit. 
D_ Projecting entrance porches are not to be included. 
E Porches, covered verandas, used for school activities and 
open air rooms and auditoriums are to be included. 
2 ESTIMATING COST FROM THE TABULATED PLAN 
The Committee has studied methods of estimating the cost 
of a building and has produced a method by which the cubic’ foot 
cost of a school building may be estimated when certain constants 
have been determined depending on the type of construction and 
when the local costs of certain labor and material items are ob- 
tained. 
The experimental work in connection with this study was 
performed by Mr. Herbert L. Patterson, Civil Engineer of the 
Boston Schoolhouse Commission and a member of our Associate 
Committee. 
140       
-P-A-G-E-151
  
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 141 
It was decided it would be possible to calculate certain con- 
stants based on previous costs of buildings of the same type of 
construction, which constants multiplied by the local prices of 
commodities and labor would produce a sum equal to the cost 
per cubic foot of the proposed school building. 
In using this method the following local costs must be ob- 
tained:

The school to which the above constants refer is of first class 
construction, as we term it, built of brick with granite trimmings. 
Partition non-bearing walls are built of terra cotta block; plas- 
tering is confined to the classrooms, special rooms and corridor 
ceilings; standing finish and floors are of wood. 
Probably changes in the constants would be necessary to 
make the method applicable to other types of construction, and 
especially to concrete or steel framed construction. 
The above cost per cubic foot is for the construction of the 
building only, excluding plumbing, heating and ventilating, and
-P-A-G-E-153
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 143 
electrical work. From data in the files of the Boston Schoolhouse 
Commission this cost is but 80 per cent. of the entire building. 
For appropriation purposes the plumbing will equal five per 
cent., the electrical work five per cent., and the heating and ven- 
tilating ten per cent., making a total cost of 100 per cent. There- 
fore the total cubic foot cost of this building will be 62.5 cents.

CHAPTER XII 
PLANNING GYMNASIUMS AND THEIR ACCESSORIES FOR JUNIOR 
AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS 
I INTRODUCTION 
Thorough, systematic, physical exercise is now recognized 
as essential for the growing boy and girl. Every junior and senior 
high school student is rightfully entitled thereto. No junior or 
senior high school conforms to modern standards unless it pro- 
vides this exercise for every boy and girl, and no building is modern 
if it does not make such provision possible. Comparatively few 
buildings measure up to modern standards for physical education 
and many of those most recently erected have serious defects. 
Thorough exercise is not the only essential to be provided 
for in physical education quarters. The gymnasium must be a 
“hall of health,’ with an abundance of fresh air and sunlight; 
there must be offices where the directors can give careful physical 
examinations to ascertain the actual needs of each boy and girl; 
there must be lockers and dressing rooms in order that pupils 
may put on appropriate gymnasium clothing; and there must be 
adequate showers so that every student will have a bath of proper 
temperature at the close of every gymnasium period. 
Exercise in badly ventilated rooms is practically useless; if 
given without ascertaining the physical condition of the boy or 
girl it is dangerous; if taken in regular school clothing it is a sham; 
and if not followed by a shower bath it loses much of its tonic 
effect and the condition of skin and clothing is unsanitary and 
almost indecent. 
The purpose of this chapter is to set forth important re- 
quirements for physical education quarters and to show plans 
meeting these requirements.

2 MINIMUM SIZE OF SINGLE AND DOUBLE GYMNASIUMS 
In the past many school gymnasiums have not been adequate 
in size. The adoption of minimum standards therefore should be 
helpful in preventing these errors in the future. 
Chart 55. The diagram on the left on the chart shows the 
space which should be regarded as the minimum for a gymnasium 
in a small school, exclusive of space for spectators. Ample pro- 
vision for spectators to view exercises, exhibitions, and games is 
desirable in every gymnasium, large or small. Such spaces may 
be provided (a) by removable bleachers placed on the floor when 
needed, (b) by galleries, (c) by the articulating auditorium and 
gymnasium, or (d) by a lifting tier of seats. The lifting tier is 
designed for schools having two gymnasiums side by side, when 
one gymnasium is large enough for an exhibition game.

Jan, 1923       
For a basket-ball game the most desirable location for spec- 
tators is in bleachers near the floor and on either, or both, of the 
long sides of the court.  
-P-A-G-E-156
    
146 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
When spectators are to be accommodated in removable or 
knock down bleachers placed on the long sides of the court, ap- 
proximately 19 to 22 inches should be added to the width of the 
gymnasium for each row of spectators, and each row will accom- 
modate approximately 44 spectators. 
The diagram on the right of the chart shows the space 80 x 
66 feet which should be regarded as a minimum for a double 
gymnasium, each half being 40 x 66 feet. The division can be made 
by a movable partition or by a double canvas drop. When these 
two gymnasiums are thrown together we have a space 80 by 66 
feet. A basket-ball game can be played in the middle and spec- 
tators seated on bleachers on both of the long sides of the court. 
Galleries are not ordinarily recommended. If provided, the 
sight lines must be so worked out as to give every spectator a 
view of the entire playing area to be used in a contest game. 
Since a gymnasium cannot be easily enlarged, allowance 
should be made for reasonable future growth of the school. When 
however, a large or medium-sized high school doubles or trebles 
in size, additional gymnasiums will be needed, and the physical 
education quarters should so be arranged that they can be en- 
larged by the addition of one or more gymnasiums. 
(a) InaSmail School. In the small school the requirements 
for a basket-ball game and spectators necessitate a gymnasium 
large enough for all regular school uses. The minimum basket- 
ball court is 35’ x 60’. A larger court is desirable. There should 
be at least three feet on all four sides for out-of-bounds, requiring 
a minimum clear floor area of 41’ x 66’. Space for out-of-bounds 
is essential as otherwise the game will become so rapid as to in- 
duce too severe heart strain for pupils of high-school age. Allow- 
ing space for a few removable bleachers, the floor area must be at 
least 50 x 66 feet. 
(b) In a Medium-sized School. If the maximum size of 
the gymnasium class would exceed 66, the gymnasium should be 
divided by a movable partition or by a double canvas drop into 
two gymnasiums, one for boys and one for girls, each gymnasium 
being at least 40 x 66 feet. The double gymnasium will then be 
at least 66 x 80 feet and will be large enough to accommodate
-P-A-G-E-157
  
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 147 
704 spectators. This provision of two gymnasiums simplifies the 
making of the schedule, and also makes it possible to have more 
homogeneous gymnasium classes. 
(c) In Large Schools. If the number of pupils in the largest 
gymnasium class will exceed 66, then the floor should be further 
increased to provide space for enough games, such as cage ball, 
volley ball, and relay races, to permit all the pupils to participate 
during gymnasium class periods. In computing the size for a 
class of more than 66 pupils of high school age, it is desirable to 
allow at least 40 square feet for each pupil. More space is highly . 
desirable to permit more general participation in mass games 
during a part of the class period. 
3 HEIGHT OF GYMNASIUM 
The clear height from the floor to the under side of the girders 
should be not less than 18 feet. This height is necessary for games 
and for swinging apparatus. 
A running track, if properly installed and banked for speed, 
requires a clear story height of at least 24 feet in the gymnasium. 
But the limited use which it serves scarcely justifies the cost of 
installation and the expense involved in the extra height which it 
necessitates. The running track is often used for seating spec- 
tators for games but it does not afford as good a view as can be 
obtained by bleachers. Furthermore, the running track interferes 
with the full utilization of the floor area for games and may ob- 
struct the natural ventilation. Practice in running may be 
obtained on the gymnasium floor if movable corner banks are 
provided and kept in the apparatus room when not in use. Much 
or all of the running, however, should be out of doors. 
4 LOcaATION OF GYMNASIUM 
The gymnasium must so be located as to be a “‘hall of health.” 
The prime essentials are direct sunlight and a maximum of natural 
cross ventilation. Windows of adequate size, therefore, must be 
on at least two opposite sides. The floor should be above the 
natural grade to insure a dry and sanitary condition, to preserve
-P-A-G-E-158
  
148 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
the life of the wood flooring, and to permit the introduction of 
outside air which will not be laden with the dust and dirt at the 
ground level. 
For the above reasons placing a gymnasium in an excavation 
under an auditorium cannot be too strongly condemned. Better 
to omit the gymnasium entirely and leave its construction to some 
future committee that will have the wisdom to place it in a sepa- 
rate or semi-detached structure with adequate sunlight and air. 
Even worse is the location in the center of the building where the 
only natural ventilation is from a skylight. The outdoor air will 
not settle in warm weather as it is warmer than the indoor air, 
and if the skylight is opened the noise from the gymnasium will 
disturb classrooms on the court. 
The best location, therefore, is in a wing, or at one end of 
the building, or in a detached or semi-detached structure of its 
own. 
Since a direct southern exposure is good for gymnasiums 
but not for classrooms, a double advantage is secured by placing 
the gymnasium wing at the southern end of the building. 
In a high school too small to have wings the gymnasium may 
well be placed at one end, preferably at the southern end. Future 
classrooms may then be built at the other end of the building 
without interfering with the natural ventilation of the gymnasium. 
The statement is commonly made that the windows should 
be kept six or seven feet above the floor. This statement is based 
upon the theory that much space should be available for wall 
apparatus. But in the modern school wall apparatus is reduced 
to a minimum or eliminated entirely. The statement was also 
based on the theory that drafts would be injurious. 
The importance of flooding with fresh air the lower part of 
the gymnasium where the pupils are breathing is so great that 
windows on at least one side should be brought down to, or nearly 
to, the floor level. This arrangement will, in mild weather, make 
the air as sweet and pure as that out of doors. This consideration 
often makes it desirable to place the gymnasium on the second 
floor level. The large space below can be used very satisfactorily 
and economically for gymnasium lockers and dressing and shower 
facilities, or even as a spacious lunch room with direct outside 
light.
-P-A-G-E-159
  
    
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 149 
Adjacent to each gymnasium and on the same floor level 
there should be a good-sized room with wide sliding doors for 
ease of access in storing apparatus, such as mats, parallel bars, 
horses, bucks, and vaulting standards. This room should also 
receive the portable bleachers when not in use. In small schools 
in which the gymnasium is used at times as an auditorium, storage 
space may be provided under the stage. 
5 MINIMUM SIZE OF GYMNASIUM IN SCHOOLS OF VARIOUS SIZES 
Before determining the size of gymnasium to be adopted we 
must determine the size of the average and maximum classes 
to be accommodated. This will depend not only on the size of the 
school, but also on the number of gymnasium periods required. 
In some of the best junior high schools, gymnasium work is 
now required daily. In Chapter II the desirability of four gym- 
nasium periods each 60 minutes was suggested. 
In senior high schools, it is generally required twice a week. 
A 60-minute period is the shortest in which pupils can have 
adequate work in the gymnasium and obtain the necessary 
shower bath. We must remember that it takes time to change 
from school clothing to gymnasium clothing and to dress after 
the shower. When, therefore, a school has periods less than 60 
minutes in length, double periods are necessary. A plan for 
double overlapping periods is given in the report of the Com- 
mission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education entitled 
“Physical Education in Secondary Schools.’’ The double over- 
lapping period takes only one single period on the gymnasium 
floor, and hence by extending the last period a little beyond the 
close of the school day, there can be as many gymnasium periods 
as there are periods in the day. 
In small schools, gymnasium classes may well contain 30 
to 40 pupils. 
In medium-sized schools, the classes should not exceed 50 
to 60 and the gymnasium should be used continuously, part of 
the time by boys’ classes taught by a man, and part of the time 
by girls’ classes taught by a woman. 
In schools in which there would be more than 80 pupils at a 
time, the gymnasium should be divided into two parts, one for 
boys and the other for girls, or there should be two gymnasiums. 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  150 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
If each gymnasium is to be used more than 20 periods there 
should be two men instructors for boys and two women instructors 
for girls, since 20 periods of gymnasium class instruction should 
be the maximum for one instructor.

nasium for schools of various sizes.

The pupil-periods per week in the gymnasium equal the 
total number of pupils to be accommodated in the school mul- 
tiplied by the number of gymnasium periods to be required of 
each pupil. 
Let us assume that there are 30 periods in the weekly schedule 
of the school. 
The third column on our chart gives the number of pupil- 
periods per week in the gymnasium. 
We have 300 pupil-periods in a school of 150 pupils in which 
2 periods are required, and the same number of pupil-periods in 
a school of only 60 pupils in which 5 periods are required.
-P-A-G-E-161
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 151 
In this 60-pupi! school the work can easily be conducted in 10 
periods giving an average-sized class of 30 and a maximum class 
of 40. Of these 10 periods 5 would consist of boys’ classes and 5 
of girls’ classes. The physical training teachers could be part- 
time teachers, each devoting 1 of their time to physical training. 
The gymnasium should be at least 41 x 66 feet, exclusive of space 
for spectators. 
In a school of 600 pupils requiring physical training 2 periods 
we would have 1200 pupil-periods. This would make 30 or 32 
gymnasium periods desirable, 15 or 16 for boys and 15 or 16 for 
girls, and would require practically the full time of two teachers. 
In a school of 900 pupils requiring 2 periods of gymnasium 
work we would have 1800 pupil periods. Two gymnasiums are 
highly desirable. Each teacher could have twenty periods per 
week of gymnasium class work which is the maximum for any 
one teacher. These classes would average 45 pupils, while some of 
the classes would reach 60. 
If each gymnasium is 41 x 66 feet the double gymnasium 
would be 80 x 66 feet and there would be space for a standard 
basket-ball court with at least 704 spectators seated in bleachers. 
With certain types of knock down or removable bleachers many 
more rows and hence more persons may be accommodated. 
6 GIRLS’ LOCKERS AND DRESSING AND SHOWER BOOTHS 
Chart 57. This chart shows a compact arrangement for 
girls’ dressing and shower booths and a convenient and sanitary 
arrangement of lockers. 
Let us follow a class. Each girl goes directly to her own 
individual steel locker, where her gymnasium clothing is hanging. 
These lockers are 6 x 12 x 36 inches, arranged in two tiers, with 
aisles of generous width to give ready access. Each locker is 
provided with a padlock having a quick combination lock. 
She removes her gymnasium suit from the locker, takes her 
padlock with her, and goes to a vacant dressing booth. These 
dressing booths are placed three on each side of a narrow aisle 
and screened by curtains. Each dressing booth is of comfortable 
size; 3 feet deep, and 3 feet 11 inches wide, and is provided with 
a long seat 12 inches wide and two cornerwise lockers. These
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
cornerwise lockers are 4 feet 6 inches high, extending from the top 
‘of the seat to a stationary top placed on a level with the top of 
the booth. The locker space is enclosed by a door, hinged so as 
to open against the side of the booth. This door has one or more 
hooks upon which to hang the clothing. She opens one of the 
lockers, hangs her school clothing in the locker, and attires her- 
self in her gymnasium suit. Upon leaving the dressing booth, 
she locks up her school clothing, using the combination padlock 
which she brought with her from her individual locker. 
After the gymnasium exercise she returns to her dressing 
booth and removes her gymnasium clothing. The woman phy- 
sical director, or an attendant, comes to the gang control plat- 
form, regulates the water for temperature, and gives a signal at 
which one girl comes into each shower booth. After entering the 
shower booth the girl hangs her towel on the long-necked hook 
just outside the booth. The director gives the shower, starting 
with warm water and finishing with medium and cold. The first 
set of girls leave the shower booths and are followed by the second 
and third sets, respectively. Each shower takes about two 
minutes and the entire class will have completed the bath in a 
total of six minutes. The second corner-wise locker in each 
booth is for use in case the school has double overlapping gym- 
nasium periods, whereby one class is dressing while another class 
is on the gymnasium floor. 
Additional shower heads with individual control must be 
placed in some of the shower booths for after-school use. 
All shower heads for girls should be placed at shoulder height 
and tipped downward so that no girl need wet her hair. Adequate 
drains are essential. 
This arrangement has the following advantages: 
(a) Sanitary Condition of Gymnasium Suits. The vapor 
from the showers is kept away from the lockers by a partition 
extending to the ceiling. The lockers are high enough to permit 
clothing to hang. The locker room can be superheated by extra 
steam pipes and the warm air drawn through the lockers, drying 
the clothing, or narrow mesh lockers may be used. 
(b) Dry Condition in Dressing Booth is secured by extending 
the partitions on the outside of the shower booth to, or nearly to, 
the ceiling and by a high sill at the entrance to the shower booth.

(c) Supervision of Showers. The crosswise partitions be- 
tween shower booths are only 5 feet high and there is a sash nearly 
5 feet above the gang control platform, so that the instructor 
can see that every girl actually takes the shower. Such supervi- 
sion is absolutely necessary because otherwise many girls will 
not take the shower. 
(d) Shower of Proper Temperatures and Duration is secured 
by the gang control. 
(e) Economy of Water also is secured by the gang control. 
(f) Economy of Time is secured by the close correlation of 
dressing and shower booths. 
(g) Economy of Space, together with privacy, are secured by 
the arrangement whereby six dressing booths use one short, 
narrow private passageway to the shower booth. The privacy 
of the passage way is increased by a curtain at the end screening 
it from the main aisle. 
No other arrangement which we have seen secures the 
economy of space, time, and water, gives the necessary regulation 
and supervision of the showers, and gives the protection of cloth- 
ing from theft and moisture. 
This plan is being installed in several New England high 
schools now under construction. In less developed form it is in 
use in the Forest Park Junior High School of Springfield, Massa- 
chusetts, and many suggestions for our arrangement have been 
secured from Mrs. Baxter, the Director of Physical Education 
for. Girls in Springfield. 
7 Boys’ GYMNASIUM LOCKER, DRESSING AND SHOWER ROOMS 
Chart 58. This chart shows the requirements for boys’ 
gymnasium accessories. 
(a) Offices. The office of the physical director for boys is 
placed where it has command of the entrance to the locker room 
and ready access to the shower room. The physician’s room 
adjoins this physical director’s office. By this arrangement all 
the health records of boys can be kept in one place where they 
may be utilized by both the doctor and the physical director. 
Moreover, the doctor and the physical director can make the
-P-A-G-E-166
154 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
medical and growth examinations, respectively, in succession, 
thus saving much time. The doctor’s office can also be used at 
other times by the physical director for boys as an inner office 
for personal conferences. 
A similar suite should be provided adjacent to the girls’ 
dressing and shower room for the physical director for girls and 
the school nurse.

  Some instructors prefer to have the offices so placed as to give © 
supervision of the floor for after school use. When dressing rooms 
are placed on the same floor level as the gymnasium the offices 
may be so placed as to articulate with both dressing rooms and 
gymnasium. 
(b) Locker and Dressing Room. The locker and dressing 
room is a distinct room separated by a partition extending to the
-P-A-G-E-167
ee Se Cn ne Te eat Caer 
SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 155 
ceiling so that it can be superheated for the drying of clothing, 
have extra ventilation to carry off odors, and be removed from the 
steam vapor of the shower room. 
Each boy in the school should have a locker. These lockers 
are 12 x 12 x 36 inches, arranged in two tiers. The rows are placed 
back to back with a 2 inch space between for ventilation, the 
air to be drawn from the locker room through the locker, thus 
drying and airing the clothing and keeping the locker room free 
from odor. Extra steam pipes should be placed in the locker 
room, under hand control, to facilitate the drying of clothing at 
night. These pipes may well be located under the lockers. The 
lockers should so be assigned that the boys of each gymnasium 
class will be distributed throughout the entire locker room, 
thereby giving space for dressing in the aisles between the lockers. 
If the size of the largest class is about one-twelfth the total 
number of lockers, the aisles need not be more than 3 feet 10 
inches in width, with a bench 6 inches wide fastened to the floor 
in the middle of the aisle. This will give 3 running feet of bench 
space for dressing for each boy. With this arrangement the space 
for lockers and dressing aisles will equal 114 square feet for each 
boy in the school. Additional space must be allowed for the 
main aisles.   
If gymnasium work is required daily, or if the school has 
only one gymnasium, the large classes will probably contain one- 
fourth to one-sixth of the total number of boys in the school. 
The aisles should then have two benches and should be not less 
than 5 feet 10 inches wide. The lockers and dressing aisles will 
then require at least 2 square feet for each boy in school. 
The plan of using cubical lockers 12 x 12 x 12 inches for the 
storage of gymnasium clothing is questionable since the clothing 
cannot hang and has no opportunity to air and dry. Moreover, 
the cubicals will not hold a baseball bat or tennis racket. Proba- 
bly it would be much better to assign two boys to a good-sized 
locker than to use cubicals. 
The plan of having wire baskets to be given out by an at- 
tendant is not ordinarily feasible in a high school since the students 
come to the gymnasium in large groups and their time is limited. 
Moreover, it involves the employment of attendants. This plan
-P-A-G-E-168
  
156 NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
should never be installed unless provision is made for cleansing 
the clothing by the use of hot steam. 
(c) Visiting Team Room. It is desirable to have a special 
dressing room for the visiting team provided with benches and 
hooks or lockers. This room is located near the entrance and 
convenient to the shower room. With this arrangement the 
visiting teams need not enter the general dressing room and all 
disputes as to property can be avoided. 
(d) Home Team Room. Our chart shows also a special room 
for the athletic squad. This, however, is not essential and it will 
be much more economical to put a few full length lockers 12 x 12 
x 72 inches in the main locker room and to distribute them to give 
plenty of dressing space on the benches. 
(e) Boys’ Shower Room. ‘The showers for boys should be 
placed in a room, without booths, and be operated under gang 
control by the instructor or an attendant. The gang control 
saves time and water and insures a bath of proper temperatures 
and duration. To prevent excessive delays in bathing there 
should be one shower head for every five boys in the largest class. 
The showers shown on this chart are arranged in two lines. Each 
line contains three shower heads which can be set to warm water, 
the fourth to medium, and the fifth to cold, and the boys can 
secure the complete bath by passing down the line. This plan 
accommodates a continuous line of boys without the delay in- 
volved when they must wait to form the squads or relays. Ade- 
quate drains are necessary. For after-school use there should 
also be additional shower heads with individual control; but these 
shower heads do not require additional floor area. The shower 
room should be provided with adequate ventilation and should 
be thoroughly separated from the locker room to prevent vapor 
from getting into the lockers. 
(f) Drying Room and Toilets. Our chart shows a drying 
room adjacent to the shower room where the boys may wipe off 
most of the water and begin to dry themselves. This keeps the 
wet out of the dressing room, thereby making the air in the 
locker room better for the drying of clothing in the lockers. 
(g) Toilets. Space is economized by having the toilets at 
the side of the drying room.
-P-A-G-E-169
  
  SCHOOL HOUSE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION 157 - 
(h) Towels. Two baskets, one for clean and the other for 
used towels are necessary as the school should provide a clean 
towel for every boy coming to the gymnasium. Wet soiled towels 
should never be put into lockers. 
(i) Bubblers. One or more bubblers should be provided for 
drinking water. 
8 THE PLACEMENT AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE ACCESSORIES 
After determining the detail requirements for boys’ and girls’ 
lockers, dressing and shower rooms and for the offices, the next 
step is to locate and arrange them in the plan. 
From some standpoints the ideal arrangement places the ac- 
cessories on the same floor level as the gymnasium itself. It is 
possible, then, to place the offices where the instructors will have 
control of both the floor and the accessories. This arrangement, 
however, requires a very large area on a given floor and generally 
results in giving the gymnasium a basement location, which is 
bad, or in cutting off space near the floor level which should be 
utilized to afford natural cross ventilation. 
Chart 59. In the next chart we have these accessories 
placed under the gymnasium. This placement is economical 
since the accessories can utilize this space which is not adapted 
to many other purposes. In the boys’ dressing room we have 
440 lockers with two benches in each aisle. This space for dress- 
ing is adequate for the large classes which will result if gymnasium 
work is required daily of each pupil. 
Attention is called to the arrangement of the doctor’s and 
nurse’s offices near the entrance with good outside light. These 
offices are accessible without entering the dressing rooms. The 
doctor’s office articulates with the office of the director of boys 
and the nurse’s office articulates with that of the director of girls. 
The room for the visiting team can be used as a passageway 
whenever the nurse and doctor need to confer. 
The office of the boys’ director commands the boys’ entrance, 
and the boys’ locker room, and is very accessible to the gang 
control. Similarly the office of the girls’ director commands the 
girls’ entrance and is likewise accessible to the gang control of the 
girls’ showers.

To insure sanitary and hygienic conditions, the school should 
furnish a clean towel to each pupil each time. These towels can 
be laundered at small expense if an electric washer is installed. 
ILLUSTRATIVE STATEMENT OF REQUIREMENTS OF A SCHOOL 
DENTAL SUITE 
A dental suite should consist of two rooms, one at least 8 x 10 
feet for operating and one 10 x 10 feet for waiting room; there 
should also be a small toilet room with washing facilities. 
The floor of the operating room should be of linoleum tile. 
The trim of the rooms should be of “‘hospital type.” 
The window of the operating room should face the north 
and the chair should be placed so that direct light will enter the 
mouth when the patient is in position in the chair. 
Hot and cold water, plumbing waste, electric current and 
compressed air should be available. 
The suite should be equipped with: 
Bracket and table Adjustable lighting fixtures 
Gas outfit Operating chair 
Hot air syringe Fountain cuspidor 
Switch board _ Atomizer set complete 
Paper cup holder Electric engine and hand piece 
Record cabinet Sterilizer on stand 
Couch Cabinet 
Five chairs 
The entire suite should be finished in white enamel. 
A discussion of the value of dental suites and lunch rooms is 
out of place in a bulletin of this kind but the architect has a re- 
sponsibility in seeing that such important adjuncts are properly 
located and designed.

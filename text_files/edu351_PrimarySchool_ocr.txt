  PREFACE 
Turis book is the outgrowth of work with many classes in 
primary education in which the author has always tried to 
make theory immediately serviceable in the evaluation of 
practice. A similar approach is attempted here. Prevalent 
defects in childhood education are pointed out for the pur- 
pose of finding a remedy. The superior organization and ~ 
instruction which are being developed in many of our public 
schools is described in order to help others to recognize the 
steps of progress. An effort is made to show that modern 
theories of education are workable wherever directed by 
intelligence and good-will. 
Grateful acknowledgment is made to the many students 
who, through class discussion and through reports and cor- 
respondence after leaving college, have helped the author to 
keep in touch with current problems in a wide field. They 
are appreciatively remembered, although their names can- 
not all be mentioned here. 
Particular acknowledgment is due to Miss Minnie Lee 
Davis, formerly Supervisor of Kindergartens and Primary 
Grades at Cleveland Heights, Ohio, for photographs of 
classrooms in that city and reports of work done in the 
schools; to Miss Mary Dabney Davis, formerly Supervisor 
of Kindergartens and Primary Grades at Duluth, Minne- 
sota, for photographs of classrooms; to Miss Grace L. 
Brown, formerly an instructor at Teachers College, for 
photographs taken by her in the Horace Mann School; and 
to Miss Sadie Kintner, for generous aid in the preparation 
of the manuscript for publication. 
The author is deeply indebted to Dr. F. M. McMurry for 
constant encouragement to undertake and push forward 
this piece of work and for stimulating criticism of it.

  INTRODUCTION 
By FRANK M. MéMURRY 
Tracuers Cotiecr, Cotumpia UNIVERSITY 
TueErz is almost as much confusion in the field of education 
at the present time as in that of politics; for education, like 
government, has been undergoing many radical changes. 
Our conception of what a child is has been wonderfully 
modified in the last forty years. Up to forty years ago, 
children had been little studied, because it was doubtful if 
they were worth it. In our attitude toward them we had 
been under the influence of the old Greeks, who threw away 
children who did not promise to reach the adult state in full 
vigor. In itself childhood for them possessed no particular 
merit or dignity. It is true, we did not throw them away; 
but we did think of them as finding their goals in adult life, 
and their education meant only the acquisition of such facts 
and skills as the distant future might require. 
Then G. Stanley Hall began a study of the contents of 
children’s minds; and gradually children became worthy 
objects of study, just as plants and animals had long been. 
In consequence, many very important facts have slowly 
dawned upon educators. Children as truly feel and purpose 
and think, within their range of experience, as adults do. 
They are as truly citizens as adults are. Their dignity is 
not something granted to them on account of promises they 
make for the future, but is inherent in them now. In reach- 
ing these conclusions educators have, no doubt, been in- 
fluenced by the attitude Jesus showed toward childhood, 
although certainly the full meaning of His teaching about 
children is not yet understood.
-P-A-G-E-10
  x INTRODUCTION 
The zeal with which hundreds of professors of education 
are now attempting to measure the intelligence of children 
is a striking witness of this change. Formerly no one in- 
quired what native abilities or aptitudes children brought 
with them to school. We were not interested at that end. 
What we cared for was what we were going to make out of 
them; the goals; the ends to be reached. The fact that the 
native characteristics are now considered as worthy of so 
much attention, being the foundation on which the educator 
must build; and the fact that each child is so much unlike all 
others that he is worthy of individual attention in this re- 
spect — these two facts show to what a wonderful extent 
children are coming into their own. 
Since children are found to be so different from what they 
were once supposed to be, their education must be under- 
taken in a different way. Even the very aim of education 
must be differently conceived. While scholarship used to 
be, perhaps, the best expression of this aim, citizenship tends 
now to take its place. That term suggests that it is what 
the child gives out, in the form of conduct, rather than what 
he takes in as knowledge that is the main concern of the 
educator. Knowledge in this case is not omitted or neg- 
lected; but it is subordinated. Energy to think, and the 
tendency to carry thought into practice, have become two 
things that receive far more consideration than formerly. 
Such aims as these require very radical changes in the 
curriculum. Forty years ago the normal child in the first 
grade was likely to have beginning reading four times per 
day; beginning number, four times; writing, four times, and 
spelling, the same number; and that was all. The first de- 
fect in such a curriculum to-day is the absence of stimulating 
ideas. In order to appeal to the tastes of children, in order 
to arouse their ambitions and inculcate purposes so that they 
will have energy to think and plan and do, new kinds of
-P-A-G-E-11
  INTRODUCTION xi 
subject-matter must be selected. Not only must more 
stimulating subject-matter be studied, but it must be more 
plainly a kind that identifies the child with social situations 
aswell. Such demands as these are difficult to satisfy, but 
they are now persistent and pressing. 
All this means that educational ideals are much higher 
than formerly, and, therefore, much more difficult of at- 
tainment. Indeed, there is much cause for alarm at present, 
because the theory of education of children has advanced so 
far beyond prevailing practice that the two are hardly within 
sight of each other. A revolution has taken place in our 
theory, and prevalent practice has hardly been able to keep 
even in touch with it. 
One result is that a great many of the teachers have never 
become inoculated with the new ideas; or, if they have to 
some extent, they have become discouraged over the situa- 
tion and abandoned hope of benefiting by further study of 
education. The task is too great for them. 
And even among the more progressive teachers there is 
much confusion. Many of the abler and more ambitious 
ones, in. endeavoring to keep up with the advance by ap- 
plying the new ideas in the classroom, are doing less effective 
work now than formerly. They have let go of much that 
was good, though old, and have not mastered the new suffi- 
ciently to make it good. Very many of the so-called “‘mod- 
ern schools” are showing practices that make intelligent 
parents and supervisors almost despair. 
Probably the most difficult ages for the application of 
modern educational theory are those of the children in the 
kindergarten and primary grades. Yet it is there that at- 
tempts to make such application have been most active and 
persistent. 
The author of this volume has had extensive experience as 
a teacher in kindergarten and in primary schools; as a super-

visor of those two departments; and as a college professor of 
modern educational theory as related to those departments. 
She is, therefore, remarkably well equipped to show the re- 
lation between broad theory and classroom procedure.

  THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
CHAPTER I 
DOES THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT FIT THE CHILDREN? 
Suppose schools had never been thought of and, without 
prejudice of any kind, we were to set about to provide an 
environment and such instrumentalities as would best aid in 
the growth and training of the young children of this genera- 
tion. Let us try to forget for a time all we know about 
schools as they exist, cease to image those we attended, 
those in which we are teaching, and the one on the next block. 
For the moment these have vanished, and it has devolved 
upon us to attempt to provide suitable conditions for the 
education of children from five or six years to nine or ten 
years of age. 
What sort of provision shall we make and what shall be 
our first consideration? Common-sense dictates that we 
proceed as is customary when the life and well-being of any 
growing animal or plant is concerned — find out all that we 
can about the creature or organism, its nature, its needs, 
what has brought it to the present stage of development and 
the changes incident to the maturing process. To solve our 
problem, then, we should naturally draw upon all the em- 
pirical knowledge concerning childhood derived from ac- 
cumulated human experience and upon the very considerable 
scientific data furnished by psychologists, physicians, and 
specialists in social science. What kind of creatures are 
these children? What progress have they already made 
before coming into this proposed ideal environment? What ss
-P-A-G-E-14
  2 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
aided the progress? If we take them for a good part of the 
day out of their natural environment can we provide an- 
other as good in every respect and better in most respects 
for their development? And what shall this especially de- 
vised environment be like? 
As to child characteristics, ask any intelligent adult to 
pick out the most marked and universal trait of normal, 
healthy children and he will almost certainly point to their 
ceaseless and varied activity of body and mind. Physical 
activity is almost incessant from the earliest random kick- 
ing and clutching to the expert running, skipping, dancing, 
and climbing of later years. Active mental life is no less 
manifest from later infancy on, as shown by eager attention 
to surroundings, by questions and remarks, and by intelli- 
gent actions. Children must always be doing something, 
especially with the hands.. They are interested in things 
animate and inanimate, and are continually trying to in- 
vestigate, explore, and construct. From early infancy to 
later years they like to go, thus manifesting a distaste for 
monotony and a marked liking for movement, for new ex- 
perience and for change of scene. They like to follow 
grown-ups around and try to do many of the things their 
__ elders are doing, and in the same way. The companionship 
of other children is also sought, and it is constantly re- 
marked that even babies recognize and are attracted to 
other babies or older children. In later childhood this 
casual companionship resolves itself, under favorable con- 
ditions, into small neighborhood groups for play and for 
mutual plans and schemes of interest to all. 
The mere novice may readily notice the earnestness and 
zeal of children in their own undertakings and the persistent 
and sustained effort often put forth to accomplish what is 
desired. The unspoiled, healthy child is never a passive, 
helpless creature waiting to be told everything and to be
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT 3 
served. He is, on the contrary, inventive, ingenious in con- 
triving ways and means to accomplish his purposes, and 
eager to do things for himself. Children are industrious, at 
least when their own “business” is concerned, and are bored 
and unhappy when occupation is lacking or of a kind 
decidedly below their powers. In_brief, normal, healthy 
children | are not by nature lazy. : 
Pre-Scnoot ENVIRONMENT AND ACHIEVEMENT 
At the age for which we propose to devise an especially 
adapted environment called the school, our small patrons of 
normal intelligence have already made remarkable advance 
in their own education. What they know and can do would 
be astonishing to us if our perceptions were not dulled by 
occurrences grown commonplace. They will never again 
in any other five years make such progress in the mastery of 
the mother-tongue; they will never advance at an equal rate 
in gaining control over their own bodies; the senses have re- 
ceived and the brain has recorded we know not how many 
impressions of form, color, size, texture, sound, and the basis 
has been laid for judgments of quantity, direction, and re- 
lationship. Many children have learned social behavior of 
a high order, and all but the slowest and least experienced 
have a fund of useful, though not very well-organized, in- 
formation. Any school which could show an equal advance- 
ment on the part of its pupils in a period of three or four 
years would be marked for special praise. But, it is ob- 
jected, there is a fallacy in such expectations, since the 
years of early childhood are those in which human instincts 
are powerfully at work, and native powers and abilities 
will expand and develop without intervention and even in 
spite of obstacles. That is true to a considerable extent as 
regards sensory and motor abilities, but children subjected to 
inferior institutional life show very plainly how even these
-P-A-G-E-16
  4 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
functions may be retarded and how much their mental at- 
tainments depend upon the right sort of stimulus and guid- 
ance. There is a learning process and a teaching process 
going on through the pre-school period, and perhaps it would 
be advisable, instead of throwing these into the discard in 
planning our school, to note some of the features which have 
made them notably successful. ‘ 
Highly important among these factors is the freedom ac- 
corded the growing child. He moves about in his small 
world devising occupations, discovering new objects and 
fresh aspects of his surroundings, talking to any one present, 
and busy from morning till night with concerns that seem to 
him interesting and worth while. In the average home this 
freedom is not simply of the negative kind, which consists in 
the removal of unnecessary restraint, but it is of a positive 
type including the provision of an interesting and fairly 
suitable equipment of furniture, toys, and simple materials 
and tools ready for childish employment. The most de- 
veloping conditions would include suitable playmates. If 
the health of children is guarded, and if in addition there are 
sympathetic and understanding older people in the family 
group who make real companions of the children, sharing 
and enlarging their experiences and placing some responsi- 
bilities on them, the conditions essential for normal growth 
and expansion of powers seem to be fully provided for these 
early years. 
Does any one believe that the characteristics described 
above are useless and undesirable, or that they are outgrown 
by the time the child is old enough to enter school? Does 
any one question the value and the general soundness of the 
educational policy noted in the pre-school period? Eminent 
authorities in the psychology of childhood tell us that all the 
traits here mentioned are strongly operative at the period 
under discussion, and that it is only through the exercise of
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT 5 
this original nature and through the prompt and timely pro- 
vision of suitable stimuli for such exercise that economical 
and efficient education is possible. This being true, then, 
some such procedure as that in a good home, with additions 
and modifications, will be essential in the school plans which 
we are to propose. 
Wauat Sort or Scuoot ENVIRONMENT DOES THE 
OricinaL Nature or CuItprEeN DemaAnp? 
Freedom with rich opportunity for varied activities should 
be the first requirement. ‘To say nothing of the physical 
effects, it is doubtful whether children can grow at the high- 
est rate mentally if confined to a desk and kept in rather a 
barren environment four to five hours a day. Certain it is 
that desirable social activities and habits cannot be obtained 
under these conditions. As in the good home, this freedom 
must be genuine and positive, carrying with it abundant 
opportunity for wholesome educative work and play for 
individuals and for groups, and not omitting the responsi- 
bility and deepened social consciousness which is always a 
part of true freedom. We cannot remind ourselves too often 
that mere removal of restraint in an impoverished situation, 
and without heightened self-control and mutual good-will, is 
not real freedom. 
In our school there must be many interesting things of all 
kinds to do — more and better than the children could find 
or invent for themselves if left alone, more and better than 
any but the most exceptional home is capable of furnishing. 
To this end there must be materials of great variety. If it is 
through the evolution of man’s hand that the human race 
has risen to its high estate, it is, as well, through the sur- 
rounding world of flexible materials amenable to his will and 
ready for the exercise of hand and mind. Anthropologists 
point out that the hand itself would never haye evolved if 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
6 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
there had been no roots, bark, berries, nuts, twigs, stones, - 
and soil, or the equivalent, for man’s manipulation and for 
the realization of his rudimentary purposes. While children 
have passed beyond this most rudimentary stage before they 
enter the kindergarten, at no point during the primary- 
school period should they be deprived of plastic, easily 
modifiable materials, capable of suggesting interesting pro- 
jects and yielding both temporary and permanent forms and 
constructions according to the worker’s purpose and design. 
Toys and apparatus of an educative kind should be fur- 
nished, and attractive picture and story books of all kinds 
suited to the maturity of the children should be at hand in 
addition to the best textbooks. 
Opportunities for social intercourse in school should be 
better than the average child enjoys outside, because, when 
so many children ar& brought together and when so many 
supposedly expert and trained adults are associated with 
them, conditions are offered for bringing out the best that 
the most gifted as well as the least endowed of the group 
have to offer. In addition, the varying ages represented in 
the grades make possible the passing on to the younger of 
ideas, suggestions, and plans which otherwise would not 
arise.. To this end, there must be abundant opportunity 
for intercourse within the class groups and between grades so 
that individuals and classes may see and know what others 
are doing, may learn from each other and thus come to ap- 
preciate and imitate what is worth while. Opportunity 
should be given for children to draw together into self- 
organized groups for work and play, to mingle, compete, 
help, oppose, lead, submit, as they do in outside life, the 
difference here being that there is more certain to ‘be some 
reckoning of the results of this intercourse and some guid- 
ance from a mature companion. There should be greater 
assurance in school than in the less-organized life outside  
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT 7 
that what is best in each individual and group is encouraged 
for the benefit of all. 
‘The best schoolroom is too narrow for full growth, just as 
the home is too narrow. Children need to be led out into 
the surrounding world of shop, industry, civic life, museum, 
park, farm, into all those places.to which the intelligent 
father likes to take his children, but which all too few have 
the opportunity to see and enjoy. Getting out of the school- 
room into the school-whole‘also helps to provide scope for 
expanding interests, just as taking the baby from the nursery 
into the family living-room brings stimulating experiences. 
The greater the school activities and the wider the associa- 
tions for all grades, the better for the pu e as well as the 
oldest pupils. 
Wuar Sort or ENVIRONMENT Is QUITE CoMMONLY 
Provipep? 
At the beginning of ‘this-chapter we tried to set aside the 
image usually called up of the average primary schoolroom, 
in order that we might better consider what type of environ- 
ment the nature of children seems to demand. Bring back 
now as vividly as possible that very common type of room. 
Does it fit the living organism described? Does it provide 
for obvious needs in the way of stimulus to a full and active 
physical, intellectual, and social life? Or are we in reality 
still bound heavily in our practice by tradition, convention, 
and preconceptions in the face of well-understood and gen- 
erally accepted facts of child nature and growth? 
Go from one city to another, chosen at random in different 
parts of the country, until you have visited ten or twelve. 
In each city enter several primary classrooms, also chosen at 
random, and remain a part of the morning. This will give a 
fair sampling of current practice and the above questions 
may be fairly answered. Fuller reports of such observations
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
will be given in Chapters II and VII. Here our purpose will 
be served by merely mentioning a few outstanding features 
of a large percentage of our primary schools. 
Visit one of these rooms before the children enter in the 
morning and ask yourself, ‘‘ For what sort of creatures is this 
environment designed? Is it for very old men and women 
who are willing and ready to sit still, and who, having ex- 
hausted the experiences of the outside world, are glad to shut 
it out? Are the expected occupants (who will enter in a few 
minutes) to see anything, do anything, make anything, talk 
to any one, find out anything for themselves?” It seems 
not. There are no half-completed objects about, no evidence 
of childish schemes under way. Everything seems well cal- 
culated to cut off stimulations of all but a highly selected 
and limited type. In an incredible number of cases there is 
no flexible material for the child’s use above the kinder- 
garten except the very limited amount employed under close 
direction at the regular Industrial Arts or Fine Arts period. 
In too many cases even this is not in evidence. All of that 
free manipulation out of which comes creative work, plan, in- 
vention, design has evidently ceased for the child in this sort 
of school. The fixed desks still found in a large majority of 
first-grade and second-grade rooms, and all but universal 
above second, discourage all genuine social intercourse and 
any but the most formal sort of physical activity. If you 
enter a formal first-grade of the better type you may see a 
more or less attractive-looking reading-chart, some of the 
| more interesting reading textbooks, a few other good books, 
some pictures on the wall, and perhaps some plants in the 
\window. In many such rooms you will find scissors, colored 
crayons, paper and paste. This better sort of equipment is 
far from universal, and is, furthermore, all too meager and 
restricted for the vivid, eager, energetic, out-reaching nature 
of children. It seems clear that the average primary school
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT 9 
has not been planned and organized after a careful study of 
the young creatures to be accommodated, but is largely the 
product of inherited practice and of the old psychology. 
There is some evidence that the physical well-being of 
young pupils is sacrificed under the conditions which quite 
commonly prevail. On this point Lewis M. Terman ! has 
collected considerable evidence which he sums up as follows: 
  Is the influence of school life sufficient to affect growth in height 
and weight? The data seem to justify an affirmative answer, 
particularly as regards the period immediately following school 
entrance. That the initiation of the child into the life of the school 
should prove such a profound shock as to affect the growth of the 
entire body forcibly suggests the desirability of reforms that will 
make the transition from home to school more easy and natural. 
There is no reason why the school should be less healthful than the 
average home. It ought to be more healthful than the average 
home, and until it is made so the campaign for school reform 
should continue. Open-air classes point the ideal by demon- 
strating that it is as possible for the school to create health as to 
destroy it. 
Wuat Sort or ENVIRONMENT DOES THE KINDERGARTEN 
FurnisH? 
If we should happen to look into a kindergarten room be- 
fore school, things will be found to be quite different. It 
will usually be large in proportion to the number of seats 
provided, and there will be a sense of space and freedom for 
movement incident to the type of furniture employed. This 
will be of a movable sort, indicating that the occupants are 
not expected to remain in one spot. The chairs will prob- 
ably be arranged in such fashion as to suggest social inter- 
course, and the tables will be large enough to serve for real 
work. Finished work in great variety and partly completed 
schemes of construction will usually be seen. A glance into 
1 Terman, Lewis M.: The Hygiene of the School Child, chap. 1v, p. 44

  10 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
the ample closets and cabinets will reveal an absolute or a 
relative wealth of materials of all kinds — blocks, clay, 
wood, textiles, paper, cardboard, toys, crayons, scissors, 
paste, paint, dishes and other small housekeeping utensils, 
picture books, small musical instruments, and other innu- 
merable objects of interest. There is almost certain to be a 
piano in this room. Everything indicates that the children 
are to be participants in an active, happy, industrious, com- 
munity life. 
Tf we should look into high-school rooms in the same sys- 
tem of schools we should be likely to find laboratories, work- 
shops of several kinds, sewing-rooms, gymnasium, a library, 
printing-press with a school publication under way, and 
evidences that many connections have been established with 
the outside world of affairs. 
What are we to infer from these contrasts? Are we to 
assume that children cease suddenly at about six years of 
age to care to investigate, construct, communicate, play, 
and work actively together and to learn by first-hand expe- 
rience? That they have become all at once sedentary in 
disposition and almost wholly occupied with the desire to 
learn to read and write? That at thirteen or fourteen years 
of age or thereabouts there is a revival of the more active, 
dynamic tendencies which the school feels obliged to meet? 
A visitor from Mars might fairly reach such conclusions, 
and his escort might find it difficult to explain the philoso- 
phy back of the primary school. 
When shall we begin to apply widely, consistently, and 
generously what many parents and all well-trained teachers 
know regarding the needs of child life? f

jected the furniture, the meager equipment, the formal 
organization, and a good part of the curriculum of the tradi- 
tional primary school, because they have rejected most of 
the’ theory upon which such ‘practice was based. Those in 
control of such experiments are scrutinizing afresh the cur- 
ricula and methods of education in order to select with in- 
telligent purpose those factors best conducive to the traits, 
habits, and-attainments most desirable for young citizens of 
to-day. 
The machinery of our great public-school systems is heavy 
and unwieldy. Nevertheless, there is abundant proof that 
leaders in this field have gradually effected marked changes 
in line with modern educational thought. Here and there 
all over the country in public schools is to be found primary 
work that rivals in every way that of experimental and de- 
monstration schools of high reputation. Only a few cities 
have as yet been able to reorganize all of their primary 
work, but in many places certain schools and particular 
classrooms are able to’ show happy childhood engaged in the 
business of life under ideal conditions. There is a tendency 
in new buildings to provide large, bright rooms. Tables and 
chairs are taking the place of fixed desks, because they per- 
mit bodily ease and freedom and encourage natural human 
relations. A much richer and more stimulating equipment 
makes possible genuine play and whole-hearted work of a 
varied character. Public-school classrooms of this type are 
shown in Figs. 1 to 4. 
Dead material is being discarded from the curriculum to 
make place for vital experience and a content well designed 
to awaken and nourish the best in child life. 
It is the purpose of the next chapter to show in some de- 
tail various types of current practice and to apply to them 
the standards presented above.

  THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT 13 
QUESTIONS 
. What are the outstanding characteristics of a normal, 
healthy child of pre-school age? 
. What features of the learning process of the pre-school 
period would we do well to incorporate in the teaching pro- 
cess of the school? Justify this selection of school environ- 
ment for the six-year-old. 
. Contrast the first-grade room that you know best with the 
kindergarten room. Can you offer any sound reasons for the 
difference? 
. What are some of the steps necessary in order to secure the 
best kind of environment for primary children?

  CHAPTER IT 
SOME TYPICAL EXAMPLES OF ENVIRONMENT AND 
PRACTICE — WHICH SHOULD PREVAIL? 
Tux question proposed in the preceding chapter, together 
with some general description of prevailing conditions in 
primary grades, was intended to serve as an introduction to 
the records of actual observations in classrooms here pre- 
sented. So far as accurate and painstaking accounts given 
by competent observers will suffice, readers will now be 
taken into schoolrooms and shown widely varying types of 
current practice for the purpose of judging their relative 
worth and soundness. 
Two of the observations here described were made by the 
author as chairman of a committee in the National Primary 
Council concerned with the study of current practice in 
primary schools. The others were made by the author as- 
sisted by Teachers College students in further pursuit of the 
same question. The results of the Primary Council investi- 
gation were published by that organization as a Bulletin,’ 
and it is from this report that the first two records were 
taken. 
Visitors spent all or nearly all of one session in each room 
described, noting what was done by teacher and pupils, how 
these activities originated, the kind of control exercised, the 
character of furniture and equipment, and the provision for 
meeting the native interests and tendencies of children. 
From a large number of such visits made in various parts of 
the country, it is believed that the six descriptions offered

ary, 1921. Columbia, Missouri, 1211 University Avenue.

  ENVIRONMENT AND PRACTICE 15 
here represent about the widest possible range of practice 
provided by our public schools. 
The first observation is representative of a military type 
of organization as found, in this instance, in the lower grades 
of alargecity system. The teacher here is absolute dictator. 
The environment is barrack-like in its severity. The small 
conscripts seem to be kept at “setting-up” exercises of a 
mental sort most of the time. It. is quite clear that this 
school is dominated by the conception that early education 
consists in the acquisition of the superficial features of a few 
intellectual skills. The method used, the environment pro- 
vided, and the kind of control exercised all fit the theory 
admirably. The “pouring-in” process and the attempt at 
fixation by sheer repetition are fully exhibited. 
The only social-moral response the observer could see was 
that of instant obedience to command while in the presence 
of the commander.

First Observation 4 
First Grade. City Public School. 
Forty-three children present. Floor space almost entirely 
covered by fixed seats and desks. No material of any kind in 
evidence, no finished or unfinished work in sight. A few inferior 
pictures on wall and some large number-perception cards on 
which were pasted groups of colored circles with corresponding 
statement, such as 3 + 4 = 7, printed on them; a set of First 
Readers on the teacher’s desk and drill cards for sight-words, 
phonics, and arithmetic; another set of Readers in the children’s 
desks. The entire class was treated as a whole, and all were ex- 
pected to give full attention all the time. 
8.40 Pupils filed in silently, took off wraps, took seats, folded 
hands behind them. 
8.45 Formal exercises in penmanship at desks with pencil and 
paper. Exercises were of the “push-pull” type. Small 
letters of alphabet made from dictation and imitation. 
9.05 Singing (two minutes).

11.50 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Formal physical exercises performed in aisles according te 
teacher’s directions. 
Arithmetic. Formal drill intended to fix addition combina- 
tions through the threes. Counting. Reading numbers. 
Written exercises in which addition tables were formulated, 
some pupils at board, others at seats. No applied number. 
This period of forty minutes was broken once by call for arm 
movements, an exercise lasting less than a minute and per- 
formed in a sitting posture. 
Filed out of room to basement and back. 
Five or six children called upon to recite rhymes designated 
by teacher. 
Formal phonic exercises and rapid drill in the recognition of 
words and phrases printed on cards. Every device known 
to the teacher of beginning reading calculated to secure 
quick response to minute elements was used. It was a 
rapid-fire, eyes-on-the-teacher drill, which lasted an hour 
and five minutes, broken twice by physical exercises occupy- 
ing a total of two minutes. The first break occurred«at 
10.36, and consisted of a playful exercise in the aisles di- 
rected by the teacher. The second occurred at 10.55, and 
consisted of a few arm movements, pupils seated. 
An active exercise involving quick change of seats, under 
teacher’s direction (one minute). 
Reading. Selection designated by teacher. Children 
seated at desks were called on one at a time and told to read 
one, two, or three lines. Not a question asked or a remark 
made regarding the thought by either teacher or pupils. 
An unexpected call for general assembly came from the 
office, class work for the day was suspended, and pupils 
passed out in regular ranks. Normally, this grade would 
have been dismissed at 12.20. When asked what the nature 
of the work would have been at this last period, the teacher 
said, “‘More reading, or whatever I think the class needs.” 
At all times when seated, except when writing, handling 
cards, or reading, pupils were required to keep arms behind 
back and were continually admonished to “sit tall.” Ac- 
cording to a conservative estimate, all the children sat in this 
posture at least a third of the time, and the “good” children
-P-A-G-E-29
  ENVIRONMENT AND PRACTICE 17 
held this position at least half the time during the entire 
morning. The varnish was worn off the backs of the seats 
where annual generations of small perspiring hands had 
been pressed. 
The second observation shows very formal work, but less 
of the military, lock-step drill than was noted in the first 
case. Here the class was much smaller, but no advantage 
was taken of the extra space. Two divisions were formed 
according to pupils’ attainments, thus showing some regard 
for individual differences, but no attempt was made to em- 
ploy the energies of the group not engaged in a lesson with 
the teacher. Note the amount of time absolutely wasted 
throughout the day. Whoever planned, approved, and 
directed this school subscribed completely to the idea that 
children have within themselves no powers for self-education 
and self-direction. In spite of the relatively small class, 
there was not the slightest opportunity for real freedom and 
choice and no training in the beginnings of how to study. 
The school is one to which visitors are often directed that 
they may see representative work. 
These particular children were promising-looking young 
Americans. Is the school starting habits of industry, co- 
operation, and independence? Is it training in ability to 
think, to set up worth-while ends, and to employ leisure time 
well? 
Second Observation 
First Grade. City Public School. 
Twenty-seven pupils present. A more attractive room than in 
Report 1, less crowded, but furnished in same manner and with 
only slightly better supply of materials. Same formal organiza- 
tion except that there was some pretense of dividing pupils ac- 
cording to ability into two sections. These were called A division, 
and B division.

  B division marched to front of room and stood for 
drill on words and phrases from a chart. 
A division at desks entirely unoccupied, but expected 
to sit perfectly quiet while others recited. 
Both divisions. General talk regarding weather re- 
port, coal production, etc.; very little contribution 
from children, teacher doing most of the talking. 
Great waste of time. 
Formal physical exercises performed in aisles accord- 
ing to teacher’s directions. 
B division. Reading. Very formal lesson, pupils at 
desks, called on to read orally one or two lines each in 
turn. No discussion. 
A division. At desks, again entirely unoccupied, but 
required to be quiet. 
All marched to enclosed court. Pupils stood aimlessly 
about part of the time. Were led by teacher in 
rather formal marching, skipping, etc. 
Handwork at desks. Cutting and pasting flowers 
according to direction. Very little opportunity for 
exercise of individuality. No purpose apparent. 
No use indicated for finished product. 
A division. Reading from chart. 
B division. At desks, entirely unoccupied. 
Formal physical exercises performed in aisles accord- 
ing to teacher’s orders. 
Both divisions, seated. Word drill. Teacher erased 
one word at a time and pupils told what was erased. 
Formal exercises in penmanship, using paper and 
pencil, at desks. 
Dismissed. 
No new ideas apparent and nothing to stimulate thinking. 
When not reciting pupils were expected to sit quietly in 
seats without anything to do. They were admonished many 
times during the morning to “sit erect and lock hands.” 
Small forward steps in several directions are shown in the 
third observation. The physical conditions are somewhat
-P-A-G-E-31
  ENVIRONMENT AND PRACTICE 19 
better inasmuch as small chairs for “recitation” groups give 
opportunity for occasional change of position. The chairs 
also suggest a more intimate intercourse at times. The 
presence of the miniature grocery store and the nature of the 
paper construction show a slight recognition of the child’s 
point of view, though the purpose of the activity is not 
clearly theirs. The drawing offers some opportunity for 
individual expression, and there is the possibility of im- 
proved taste and heightened pleasure in good literature. 
There is a little genuine, natural conversation, the first we 
have so far encountered in our visits. Occupation of a re- 
stricted kind is provided for the group at their desks, but no 
provision is made for choice or variety. The rapid workers 
who finish assigned tasks before the period is over have 
nothing to do. Very little faith is shown in the ability of 
children to take responsibility and to select and carry for- 
ward worth-while undertakings. 
Third Observation 
Second Grade. City Public School. 
Thirty-five children present. Fixed seats. Small chairs in 
open space at front of room. Window-boxes with growing plants. 
A few good pictures on wall. ‘Two sets of good reading texts on 
teacher’s desk. A miniature grocery store in one corner made in 
part by pupils. The only materials were construction paper, 
paste, crayons, scissors, and plasticine. 
8.30 Children filed in silently, took seats, folded hands on desks. 
Rote singing, some of the songs chosen by children. Salute 
to the flag. Teacher told story of Snow White and Rose 
Red. Children listened with interest. Teacher asked a 
few questions concerning story, requiring pupils to rise and 
respond in complete sentences. 
8.45 Sec. I. Reading. All new words in lesson taught by 
phonetic analysis, before reading. Pupils read orally in 
turn around class. No questions or remarks by pupils. 
Sec. II. At seats, copied words of spelling lesson from black- 
board. Told to study the lesson but no indication of any 
special plan for study.  
-P-A-G-E-32
20 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
  9.00 Alternation by sections, of above lessons and exercises. 
9.15 Sec. I. Drill in arithmetic. Addition combinations. Va- 
rious devices calling for lively response and some physical 
activity. 
Sec. II. Did some sums copied from blackboard. 
9.35 Alternation by sections of above lessons and exercises. 
9.55 All marched to basement, and then to open court for short 
free play. 
10.10 Penmanship lesson. ‘Teacher selected a few of the best 
sheets, praised them, and pinned them on the wall. 
10.20 Construction paper and scissors passed by pupils. Teacher 
dictated instructions for box. Said it might be used in 
grocery if desired. A little real conversation at this time. 
Boxes when finished did not seem to be highly valued by 
pupils. Many were thrown in scrap basket at dismissal 
time. 
10.40 Sec. I. Spelling lesson. Chiefly a test, oral and written, 
of words previously assigned. 
10.52 Sec. II. Spelling lesson. Same kind, with different words. 
11.10 Both sections together at seats. Written composition. 
Talked about Snow White and Rose Red. Teacher wrote 
children’s statements on board. Certain words were em- 
phasized, then erased, pupils told to fill in blanks and copy 
sentences on papers. Product consisted of brief beginning 
of the story. When told they might illustrate, pupils got 
out colored crayons and worked with manifest interest. 
11.40 Phonic drill, entire class. 
11.55 Study period. Both sections studied reading lesson. Teacher 
moved around room and assisted weaker pupils. 
12.15 Easy sight reading, both sections together, at seats. Ac- 
companied by a little dramatization of story read, rather 
closely directed by teacher for evident purpose of securing 
more expressive oral reading. 
12.35 Dismissed. 
When not otherwise indicated, the group under instruc- 
tion of teacher occupied the chairs at front of room. 
The fourth observation was made in a public school, first 
grade. The life here described presents a pleasing contrast

to the barren mechanism found in the first two observations. 
These little folks are allowed to live and to act like real chil- 
dren. We see them moving about in a normal way engaged 
whole-heartedly in interesting childlike occupations. They 
are very evidently learning to direct and control themselves. 
This is shown by their ability to inhibit loud talking and 
noisy movements and to carry on numerous delightful and 
worth-while activities without disturbing the class engaged 
in reading. Even this brief glimpse shows that they are en- 
couraged to be original, thoughtful, and neighborly, and that 
habits of industry, courtesy, and independence have a chance 
to develop. 
The equipment is decidedly above the average, but is not 
more costly than that to be found in many formal class- 
rooms. Several items were evidently contrived by the 
teacher’s ingenuity. 
e 
Fourth Observation Q- 
First Grade. City Public School. 
Twenty-five children present. Two and one half hour class. 
Room furnished with small tables and chairs, low cabinets contain- 
ing materials for stimulating handwork; low cabinets to use in keep- 
ing unfinished work; large floor blocks for building; low book- 
shelves containing books for children; two small-type printing- 
presses, one large-type press for use of the children; easel used for 
large painting; attractive posters and bulletin board for stimulating 
reading: Ferns and flowers arranged in low bowls. Low black- 
boards for use of the children. 
8.35- 9.05 Pupils entered at 8.35; after greeting the teacher each 
child went to the cabinet and took out the unfinished 
work of the previous day or began something new. 
The teacher went from child to child seeing that each 
was nicely started, then sat down and three children 
needing help in reading were helped. After that one 
child who had been struggling with figures on the 
board was taught how to make eight correctly. An- 
other child was guided im writing his name on the
-P-A-G-E-35
  9.05- 9.35 ENVIRONMENT AND PRACTICE 23 
blackboard. During this period the children were 
free to choose any activity they wanted. The follow- 
ing were noted: one child was painting a large elephant 
to illustrate the rhyme made by the class the day 
before. This picture and rhyme were one of a series 
of rhymes being made by the children similar to those 
in Edward Lear’s Alphabet Book. Several girls were 
sewing tarlatan wings to be used in a dramatization. 
Several boys were making goblin hats. Other girls 
were making torches of paper for the dramatization. 
One boy was printing a rhyme with the press. An- 
other boy was drawing a picture of the goblins and 
the princess on the blackboard. One little girl read 
to herself. £ 
At 9.05 the teacher played the xylophone and the 
children became quiet instantly. She asked if they 
had everything they needed to work with during the 
period when they would be by themselves while the 
others were reading. After some deliberation, certain 
children went to the cabinet and chose more material. 
Then, without saying anything, the teacher sat down 
in the front of the room. The children brought their 
chairs close around her. After a good-morning song 
she opened the Bible and began to read, “For, lo, the 
winter is passed, the rain is over and gone,” ete. The 
children said this as she read. This. passage was 
printed and placed over some spring pictures in the 
back of the room. \J'wo or three children turned in- 
stinctively to that place showing that they associated 
the thought and the printed words. The Lord’s 
prayer followed, then a number of spring songs chosen 
by. the children were sung. Requests for poems to 
be read were made, and “ Fairies and Chimneys” by 
Rose Fyleman, was read, the children saying parts 
that they knew. It was a windy day and before 
school the teacher had posted on the bulletin board 
the sentence, “This is a windy day.” Several chil- 
dren had read it, and a boy suggested that “Kite 
Weather,’ a poem'in Jane, Joseph and John, by 
Bergengren, be read. After this the children went to 
their seats. ‘Nothing was said about the work that -

they were to do, as each had determined earlier what 
he was going to do. They were getting ready for 
a dramatization of The Magic Kiss, by Christine 
Chaundler, and much of the work naturally centered 
around that, even though the children were free to 
choose otherwise if they cared to. 
The teacher wrote, “A, Reading Class,”’ on the board, 
and that group brought their chairs to the front of the 
room and formed a small circle around her. Their 
problem was to read the part of The Magic Kiss 
that answered the question that the teacher held up. 
Questions had been printed on separate cards by the 
teacher. Each child had a condensed chapter of the 
story, which he was to read if it answered the ques- 
tion. As there was a chapter for each question, each 
child had a chance to read. Comments on the reading 
were made informally by the children. The teacher 
kept in a notebook her own comments on their work 
and needs. 
Other Reading Group — Reading from First Readers 
silently — then answering questions printed on the 
board bearing on what they had read. ; Every child 
had read by the end of the period in one group or the 
other except the three slowest children. They had 
been given individual help during the period from 
8.35-9.00. 
Free activity in the yard — teacher there but simply 
observing. The slide and swings proved most popu- 
lar. 
Clearing up the room — putting unfinished work in 
the lockers. Ata signal from the teacher the children 
were asked if the room presented a satisfactory ap- 
pearance. They decided that there were untidy floors 
and the attention was called by a child to the Rules 
Chart formulated by them early in the year, one of the 
rules being — “‘Keep the floor clean!” Cleaning up 
took some of the time usually devoted to a story so 
they decided to use the remaining time dramatizing 
The Magic Kiss. 
The teacher sat down and observed. The children 
pushed back the tables, made the toadstool ring, put 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  ENVIRONMENT AND PRACTICE 25 
on their costumes if they were finished, brought in the 
Victrola and got the records for the teacher to use 
(that was her part). One child told the story — the 
music began and the rest of the story was dramatized 
and interpreted to music. Following the dramatiza- 
tion, comments and suggestions and criticisms of each 
other were given, and they decided that just as soon 
as the costumes were finished they could invite the 
mothers. Following the setting to rights of the room 
(another class uses the room from 12.50-3.30) they 
sang a Good-bye song, and were dismissed informally. 
The first-grade teachers in this city feel that a period of 
two and one half hours is too short a time for the children, 
but since each teacher has two classes of twenty-five each, 
and sometimes thirty each, it seems to be the best that can 
be done until new buildings relieve the crowded conditions. 
School opens at 8.35, but is not supposed to begin until 
8.45; thus it is called a two and one half hour session, but 
really is two hours and forty minutes in length, for most of 
the children are there by 8.35. 
Compare the next account with the Third Observation. 
This also is of a public school, second grade. The organiza- 
tion here shown seems to recognize that the school is the 
children’s world during the time they are in it. They take 
entire charge of some of its affairs and share so far as they 
are able in others. They contribute some of the subject- 
matter, set up many of the objectives, and take a good deal 
of responsibility in the matter of acquiring the facts and 
skills expected in this grade. Faith is shown in these chil- 
dren. They are treated as seven-year-olds who can reason, 
plan, and direct themselves effectively, and their responses 
show that on the whole they fulfill these expectations.

Fifth Observation 
Second Grade. Public School. 
Thirty-five pupils present. Pleasant room, plants in windows. 
Individual tables and chairs. Large table called “‘free-work table” 
containing good assortment of materials for independent work and 
play such as games, puzzles, books, scissors, crayons, paper, print- 
ing outfits, cards for drill. A sand table in one corner, on which a 
woodland scene in spring is being developed. A playhouse, made 
out of two packing-boxes, is being renovated and refitted. A bulle- 
tin board contains pictures and items of immediate and temporary 
interest, some of these evidently contributed by the children.

Enter classroom informally, greet the teacher, put 
away books and lunch. Some go to free-work table; 
get books to read, games to play or booklet to work 
on. Some work on playhouse, others plan features of 
sand table scene, others use number, phonetic and 
word cards for self-drill. 
Opening exercises. A child in charge part of the time. 
Pupils and teacher choose songs and poems. A sen- 
tence prayer is recited. Children tell about plans for 
the sand table and show articles brought for it. 
Social studies. Subject, migration of birds, and spe- 
cial value of birds in this locality. Conversation, dis- 
cussion, pictures, individual reports. 
Reading. Class divided into three groups. Ad- 
vanced group work independently at story to dramatize 
which they will give to the class. Second group work 
at a lesson in silent reading guided by directions on 
the blackboard, — questions that will aid in interpre- 
tation of the story. One such direction was, “Draw a 
picture about a part of the story that you would like 
to explain to the class.” Third group. With the 
teacher in a study reading lesson, attention being 
given to mastery of mechanics. Assignment was for 
certain definite use of some drill material which was 
explained. When any individuals not at work with 
teacher finished the assignment, they went quietly to 
the work table and chose some material for independ- 
ent work. ;

  THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Arithmetic. (Group 1.) Directed work by the 
teacher. For five minutes of the time they drilled 
themselves in groups with pupil leaders (addition 
combinations). Teacher observed in order to check 
habits of work. 
Recess period on playground. Played games inde- 
pendently, teacher observing. 
English. (Literature and Composition.) Pupils 
chose favorite poems to recite. Teacher read part of 
new poem, Celia Thaxter’s “ Wild Geese”’: 
“Wark, what a clamor goes winging through the 
sky! 
Look, children! Listen to the sound so wild and 
high! 
Like a peal of broken bells, —kling, klang, 
Kling, — 
Far and high the wild geese cry, ‘Spring! It is 
spring!’”’ 
They talked about the “pictures” in the poem and 
asked to have typewritten copies for their poetry 
books. Decided to try to draw a flock of wild geese 
later in the day. Planned and formulated certain 
captions needed for a chart of native birds which they 
are making. 
Arithmetic. (Group 2.) Same type as Group 1. 
Spelling. Test and Study lesson. 
Writing. Directed lesson, especial attention to in- 
dividual needs. Practiced writing captions mentioned 
above. 
Music. Songs chosen by children. Class “Choir” 
sang, led by pupils. 
Directed lesson in phonics. 
Reading. Each of the three groups worked with the 
teacher during this time, reading silently and orally. 
“Audience” reading with two most advanced groups 
in which they read aloud stories and poems chosen 
from the class library and especially prepared to enter- 
‘tain others. 
When not with the teacher, pupils finished assign- 
ment and then had a limited choice of very quiet oc-

The way a few really social ends give meaning and direc- 
tion to much of the “regular” school work is well shown in 
the following report of an observation in a fourth grade. 
While this is a demonstration school, there is nothing here 
described which could not be carried out in any school with 
reasonably good conditions, backed by intelligent convic- 
tion on the part of those in charge. The lack of shop and 
gymnasium might cause two of the children’s schemes to be 
somewhat curtailed. It is a noticeable fact that, while this 
is a short school day and many fascinating schemes are under 
way, the formal subjects have a fair share of attention. 
Sixth Observation 
Fourth Grade. Demonstration School. 
Twenty-nine children present. Fixed seats grouped on one side 
of room. Chairs in front of room for class work. Long, low box- 
seat for materials and larger pieces of unfinished work. Shelves to 
preserve and display work. Bookshelves and a library of fifty or 
sixty excellent books. Workbench and a few essential tools in- 
cluding jig-saws. Wood, clay, paint, textiles, maps, globe, good 
pictures and casts, growing plants. 
Projects in evidence in various stages of completion: a play- 
house to be presented to the Day Nursery in the neighborhood; 
good-sized rag dolls, furniture for the playhouse, and wooden toys; 
many and various objects in clay drying in the window; five differ- 
ent puppet shows under way with all the appurtenances taking 
shape; a large pictorial map. 
Pupils entered informally as they arrived, hung up wraps, put 
books away, chatted, and worked individually in a variety of ways.

Returned to room and took seats. Teacher said, 
“‘What shall we take up first?” This class had re- 
cently made themselves responsible for planning and 
launching a May Party or simple May festival. On 
the blackboard was a list of the things needing to be 
done as the initial steps. Pupils had planned and re- 
corded these as follows: 
1. Prepare speeches making proposals to other 
classes. 
. Practice speeches. Select five of the best. 
. Costume Committee collect materials. 
. Measure materials. 
. Practice dances. 
Write captions for notices. 
Class consulted this list and decided to practice 
speeches prepared the day before. ‘These speeches 
were intended to inform lower grades about the pro- 
posed May Party and to ask them to take part in some 
special way. There were several “try-outs” followed 
by friendly criticism from classmates and teacher. 
Suggestions were offered showing how a speech in- 
tended for kindergarten children should differ from 
one for Third Grade, for example. 
It had been discovered that the stock of cambric, 
cheesecloth, etc., for entire school was getting low. 
A committee now went out to collect from primary 
class rooms all available materials for costumes. The 
committee was to list colors, measure, and report 
amount of each.

10.30-10.45 Recess. Outdoor play. 
10.45-11.30 Special project work. Five boys went to the Manual r 
Arts room. Worked on furniture for playhouse. 
Two boys made wall-paper for playhouse. Seven 
girls worked on rag dolls and dresses for Day Nurs- 
ery. Three boys and one girl worked on puppet 
shows. ‘Two girls and one boy drilled themselves in 
spelling for fifteen minutes. One boy and one girl 
read chosen books about twenty minutes. The com- 
mittee on measuring went to other rooms, brought 
back cloth and measured it. Two boys and one girl 
went out in hall and practiced their speeches. 
The science teacher came in during the latter part 
of period and helped two boys arrange small electric 
lights for puppet shows. While this was going on all 
pupils took seats and watched in order to get the bene- 
fit of the demonstration. 
All pupils filled out cards recording briefly what 
they had done during this period of forty-five minutes 
and filed their cards in a case kept for that purpose. 
Five minutes allowed to get work put away. 
11.30-11.50 Gymnasium. Part of time given to Bear Dance and 
Crane Dance for May Party. Fruitful suggestions 
from children regarding the dances as they were not 
“ready-made.”

features. Plans made for further work on large pic- 
torial map under construction by class, intended to 
tell the story of cotton, so far as geography of the 
United States is concerned. 
Note: Geography alternates with History and Civics. The en- 
tire period, 10.45-11.30, is not used every day for “special project 
work.” A redistribution of time provides for directed Music and 
Fine Arts on certain days. The period, 8.45-9.10 is used at times 
for written work. 
What chance have the native instincts and capacities of 
children to play their part in the educative process under 
such a regimen as prevails in the first two schools described? 
Not only is there nothing to stimulate and direct curiosity, 
exploration, manipulation, construction, language, and so- 
cial interchange, but all of these highly valuable reactions 
are definitely and effectively excluded or repressed. The 
third example is only slightly more generous toward the » 
active impulses of children, and only slightly more attentive 
to the enrichment of life and the formation of good habits. 
In none of these is there any provision for children’s pur- 
poses, or any suggestion that what they are doing in school 
bears the least relation to their home and neighborhood life. 
Is it not a poor day’s work for child or man which consists of 
such minute and isolated products that no immediate pur- 
poses and plans of any scope can possibly arise? Even for 
an adult is it not labor on a low plane which leaves nothing 
at office, shop, or laboratory when the day is done to cause 
him to turn back to the unfinished work with some zest and 
anticipation? ‘The small child who leaves nothing at school 
when the day closes but some poor little scraps of written 
work and a primer or reader with a marker to show the 
place, has been deprived of the very root of earnest work; 
some scheme or plan (individual or collective) which has en- 
listed his effort to-day and which he will take up again with 
eagerness and zeal to-morrow.

  34 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Evidence gathered in the Primary Council investigation 
and also in an investigation regarding the amount of oral 
English in primary grades ! goes to show that common prac- 
tice in many large city systems strongly resembles that in the 
first and second observations described above. In certain 
sections of the country, at least, general practice seldom 
reaches a plane very superior to that described in the third 
report. This judgment is further confirmed by the examina- 
tion of daily programs for primary grades furnished the 
author in 1923-24 by about two hundred students at Teach- 
ers College from all parts of the country. 
There are several large cities and numerous smaller places, 
where under superior leadership the best features reported 
in the last three observations have been rather generally in- 
corporated. There are, of course, hundreds of single class- 
rooms and many individual public schools where this kind of 
work is well established. 
Which of these examples are the primary schools of your 
town or city most like? If the types here shown seem too 
few and not to offer enough shades of practice, examine the 
larger number in the Primary Council report referred to 
above and ask yourself the same question. 
With no evidence but that of the bare program or time- 
table for a classroom, one can tell a good deal about the na- 
ture of the life which goes on there. Compare the following 
examples taken from a large collection which came straight 
from our public schools in 1923. For convenient reference, 
these programs are designated as U., V, W, X, Y, Z.

The shortness of the periods and the large number of 
periods in a day are striking features of the programs desig- 
nated as U, V, and W. These characteristics become still 
more noticeable when we analyze the programs. 
U, with twenty periods, has only three that exceed fifteen 
minutes, the median length of the time divisions being about 
ten minutes. 
V, with a five-hour day and seventeen periods, manages to 
get ten periods of twenty minutes each. 
W has a day of four hours and forty-five minutes divided 
into twenty-six periods. Ten of these are from two to five 
minutes long. No exercise lasts more than twenty minutes. 
These facts are shown in the form of graphs in Fig. 5. 
In these three rooms it is clear that the children move 
rapidly from one kind of drill, exercise, or recitation to an- 
other throughout the day, with no time and no opportunity

to relax and throw them- 
selves into some absorbing 
occupation. , 
At their seats these young 
children are supposed to be 
engaged in silent reading, 
written numbers, written 
spelling, “busy-work,” and 
word-building until called 
for another direct lesson. It 
is clear that there are no in- 
teresting childlike activities 
provided which are meant 
to continue from day to day 
and to gather momentum 
as they develop. In these 
three programs a fair amount 
of drawing and music, a little 
story-telling, ten minutes for 
games (in one case), and the 
uncertain “physical train- 
ing” in another, comprise all 
one can find of provision for 
the active and expressive side 
of child nature. If the read-

rooms there are several 
periods ranging from thirty 
minutes to an hour in 
length. There is an entire 
absence of rapid skipping 
through a succession of 
five- and ten-minute pe- 
riods. The day begins with 
a long period the nature of 
which is denoted by such 
terms as free period, chosen activities, self-directed play and 
projects. Time is allowed in which to check up and criticize

ENVIRONMENT AND PRACTICE 41 
work, to set standards, and to consider the next steps. Prac- 
tical arts, industrial arts, dramatization, play, and study are 
given a place, and in these activities pupils find worth-while 
employment while the teacher is busy with different groups. 
The expressive arts, language, music, story, dramatization, 
drawing, and writing (not penmanship exercises), are liber- 
ally provided for. These last three programs, especially Y 
and Z, show a relatedness and interplay of parts entirely 
lacking in the first three examples. 
Onepf the first steps in modifying the severe mechanism 
of the cpnventional program is to provide at least one long 
period of from thirty to fifty minutes a day in which the 
children may engage with some degree of real freedom in 
a variety of worth-while activities. This necessitates, of 
course, a reasonable supply of materials, though a costly 
outfit is not necessary. If the children are encouraged to 
engage in constructive work, dramatic play, representative 
play, self-drill, educative games, housekeeping activities, 
etc., there will be launched many things which will carry 
over and affect advantageously the rest of the curriculum. 
The next step is to take the reading out of the narrow con- 
fines of numerous ten- and fifteen-minute periods, and get a 
longer stretch of time when the several groups will all be 
engaged in reading or activities related to reading. The 
teacher gives attention to different individuals and groups 
for the particular work needed, and the others continue with 
games, puzzles, printing outfits, blackboard writing, or what- 
ever has been chosen or assigned. 
This plan gives at least two long periods in the day when 
the children are engaged in significant and relatively unified 
activities. They will have a good deal of physical freedom 
in the period first described and will be somewhat more 
restricted in the second. 
When these two lines are successfully developed, it will be

  CHAPTER IIT 
WHAT IS THE ee OF THE KINDERGARTEN IN THE 
PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Ever since the kindergarten was introduced into the public 
schools there ‘has been a persistent inquiry regarding its 
place and use in the total scheme of education. The kinder- 
garten is not a part of our compulsory education system and. 
it has made its way very gradually into our schools. For 
this reason its sponsors have rarely been required to state its 
aims and objectives simply and definitely in terms similar to 
those governing the elementary school. 
The more rapid development of the kindergarten in recent 
years, a wider general interest in matters of education, and 
the pressure of school finance have given greater prominence 
of late to the question under discussion. Frequently the de- 
mand is still more pointed, and the inquirer asks, “Does the 
kindergarten prepare for first grade?”’ ‘‘ What do the chil- 
dren learn in kindergarten?” The more-advanced stages of 
education are always inclined to judge a lower stage by its 
specific contribution to the work of the higher department. 
Naturally the kindergarten has resisted the viewpoint that 
its value to the child lies chiefly in preparation for first 
grade. 
It must be admitted that the earlier attempts of kinder- 
gartners to elucidate their aims and state results were not 
very successful. It has taken a long time to counteract the 
influence of a vaguely conceived abstract theory and to 
develop a scheme of education for early childhood based 
squarely on a platform of modern psychology, social science, 
and hygiene. Less and less frequently, however, as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
modern movement grows, do we hear that the kindergarten 
brings about “the all-around development of the child,” 
that it results iff “the harmonious unfolding of his powers.” 
Such blanket statements once sounded well, but they really 
told nothing. To-day, kindergarten teachers are just as 
willing and competent as any other group to discuss the 
results of their work in terms of specific changes which they 
are trying to bring about in their pupils. 
Wherever kindergartens exist, it. is necessary that the 
question raised in this chapter be answered satisfactorily. 
When a growing organism is concerned, one year of devel- 
opment and training cannot be cut off from subsequent 
periods with no attempt at an estimate of healthy growth. 
People directing the education of six-year-old children must 
look back on the five-year-old period and try to learn what 
was attempted and what was accomplished. 
Perhaps the main inquiry can best be satisfied through a 
consideration of a few separate phases. 
Rea Unrry or KinperGARTEN-PRIMARY IS NOT 
SECURED THROUGH SUPERFICIAL FratuRES 
~The earlier attempts at establishing a better relationship 
between the two departments were ineffectual because they 
did not go to the root of the difficulty, but dealt with the 
more superficial points of difference. There were efforts to 
borrow from the kindergarten minor attractive features to 
brighten the primary work, to make it more playful. Use- 
less paper-folding, paper mat-weaving, stick-laying, and 
more intricate building constructions were proposed as 
suitable for the first grade mainly because they were too 
difficult for the kindergarten. Many primary teachers, 
eager for some material for their pupils, tried to introduce 
such work, only to meet with failure. These occupations 
were lacking in purpose and in educational worth. They 
’

were retained in kindergarten for so long a time because the 
conservative teacher was a stanch believer in the theory 
back of them. She sat firmly in the mid&t of a relatively 
small group of children and, by dint of much gentle insist- 
ence, by personal magnetism, and sometimes by cajolery, 
got them to submit to imposed and unchildlike objectives. 
Such exercises, when transferred to the primary room, with 
its large class and busy teacher, met with almost instant 
failure. The common sense of teachers and children re- 
volted at the utter emptiness of the work, and it was 
observed that the tangible results were often poorer in 
quality than similar work done by kindergarten children. 
The stronger primary teachers rejected such material, and 
the less clear-sighted were disappointed and baffled at their 
inability to make use of “kindergarten ideas” in their own 
work. The conservative kindergarten teacher looked on 
and was distressed at the mishandling of her revered ma- 
terials and at the apparent slipping backward of her pupils 
of the year before. The sad thing is that such materials, 
already doomed to banishment from the progressive kinder- 
garten, still find place on many primary shelves, and such 
exercises are sometimes pointed out to-day as evidence that 
“our first grade is almost like a kindergarten.” 
At various times and places there have been attempts to 
saddle on the kindergarten part of the burden of the early 
work with symbols. Goaded by the oft-repeated criticism 
that they can point to no really tangible results from a year’s 
work, pressed by citizens, superintendent, school board, 
to give satisfactory account of themselves, kindergarten 
teachers have in some places accepted a definite allotment 
of work in reading and number. There is little to justify 
such an arrangement. The short school day, the immature 
minds of the children, and the meager basis they possess for 
the meanings of symbols make this a wasteful proceeding
-P-A-G-E-58
  46 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
except for a small group of the most precocious or mature 
pupils. To do the amount of work necessary to secure 
measurable and permanent results in reading with masses of 
five-year-olds will force the kindergarten teacher to neglect 
much more important things. If the teaching of reading is 
skillfully handled from the first grade on, are not the six or 
eight years of the elementary school ample to give all the 
training in this art which the various individual capacities 
of the children can appropriate? 
The very large percentage of failures in the first grade 
(about twenty-five per cent) shows that a whole year after 
the pupils have left the kindergarten large numbers of them 
are still not ready to meet the formal requirements commonly 
exacted in the first grade. Why push this work in symbols 
down upon still less mature minds unless we wish to increase 
the number of failures and start off a still larger percentage 
of our school population with the sense of discouragement and 
defeat. For most of those failing in the first grade would 
have been more complete failures had they been forced to 
attempt to learn to read while in the kindergarten. 
Dogs THE KINDERGARTEN PREPARE FOR First GRADE? 
Too often discussion of this question shows that the in- 
quirers have in mind, not the larger issues at stake in the 
early stages of education, not the establishment of valu- 
able personal and social habits, not even the accumulation 
of a considerable amount of useful information; what they 
really wish to know is. whether the kindergarten holds itself 
responsible for starting the children in formal school work. 
It is often strongly implied also that the kindergarten fails 
of its duty if it does not build up just the kind of habits and 
responses called for in a particular type of first grade, be the 
latter right or wrong as measured by modern standards of 
education.  
-P-A-G-E-59
       THE PLACE OF THE KINDERGARTEN 47 
Pupils from a kindergarten so conducted that they must 
sit and wait for every move to be directed by the teacher, 
even to the manner and moment of removing the lids of 
boxes of blocks, whose every action when not so dictated is 
initiated and controlled by the piano, will certainly be mis- 
fits in a primary room, where self-reliance and other good 
work habits are called for, and where it is expected that 
conduct shall be guided by thought processes rather than 
by rhythmic automatisms. Conversely, children promoted 
from a kindergarten where they have had much freedom of 
the right sort, where initiative and rational social behavior 
have been encouraged, and where individuality has had rea- 
sonable consideration, will be unhappy and sometimes difficult 
citizens if they happen to come under a radically different 
social order of the lock-step, drill-master type in the primary 
grades. It must be bad for the nervous organism and the 
mental and moral life of children to be subjected to such 
sudden and irrational alternations of policy and method. 
Although a categorical answer cannot be given to our 
question, it can be shown that a good modern kindergarten 
does prepare in specific and recognizable ways for any first 
grade that is moderately progressive. 
Linevistic TRAINING 
Tn localities where there is a large foreign population the 
kindergarten almost pays for itself in the excellent language 
training which children get. Conditions are the very best 
for this work. Pupils are in the stage where linguistic ac- 
complishment is easy and rapid, and the kindergarten or- 
ganization and régime is such that the strongest stimuli to 
natural idiomatic speech are offered in abundance. The 
superior opportunity furnished is further discussed in 
Chapter I. Children from all but the most favored homes 
need the language training they receive in kindergarten. 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Although kindergartens in general should not be ex- 
pected to launch the formal work in the mechanics of read- 
ing, they can and do ina very real sense lay the founda- 
tion for the art. Here again the training in language is of 
immeasurable importance. If reading is to deal with mean- 
ings, it is obvious that the child who has a working vocabu- 
lary of two thousand words is much better prepared for 
intelligent reading than one who commands only three 
hundred words; and if he pronounces these words clearly 
and correctly, he is in a better state to understand and 
appropriate the later work in phonics. / Indeed, phonetic 
training of the most essential kind is an important feature 
of the kindergarten year. It is directed toward clear enun- 
ciation, pleasing tone quality, and a true ear for shades of 
sound, rather than to the analysis of words and word-build- 
ing required in some methods of beginning reading. The 
kindergarten encourages a great deal of vocal play which 
appeals to an instinctive interest and furnishes an excellent 
aid in getting control over speech organs. 
Layine a Founpation For Reapine 
The contents of children’s minds influence greatly the 
facility with which they take up reading and the intelligence 
with which they pursue it. Familiarity and interest are 
very important factors in the reading process. The eye- 
movement even in a skilled reader varies with the character 
of the reading matter which he encounters. That which is 
familiar in thought and idiomatic in structure, dealing with 
ideas which are easily apprehended, is read rapidly and ° 
surely, whereas material which is unfamiliar in either 
language or content is read more slowly and with more re- 
tracing of words and phrases. I Whatever, then, furnishes 
the children’s minds with clear images of the world of real- 
ities, with vivid concept and correct ideas to be called up by
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE PLACE OF THE KINDERGARTEN 49 
the spoken and printed word, will be of the utmost value in 
mastering the reading process. Huey ! says we read by cues 
and by clues, and offers scientific evidence that the act of 
reading is accomplished partly by suggestion and inference, 
familiarity “enabling any part that may be clear to help 
into consciousness other parts that are indistinct.” 
Children who know little or nothing about animals and 
birds and bees, trees and flowers and gardens, parks, mar- 
kets, railroads and steamboats, games, play, toys, or any- 
thing outside their own narrow environment, bring little to 
the printed page that will help in its interpretation. They 
cannot judge very well whether what they are attempting 
to read makes sense or not, since they are ignorant regarding 
so many of the experiences dealt with in children’s books. 
A multitude of meanings and associations must be built up 
while such beginners are struggling with the early steps in 
reading instead of being already established and therefore 
prompt to spring to consciousness through the new medium 
of writing and printing. ; 
The kindergarten has always attached great importance 
to first-hand experience, and most teachers go to great 
trouble to secure for their pupils the direct contacts and im- 
pressions which will enrich their minds and clarify their 
ideas. Excursions are frequently taken to such places as 
parks, museums, markets, milk stations, craftsman work- 
shops, greenhouses, the water-front, post-office, and engine- 
house. Other means are employed, such as bringing to the 
kindergarten for a longer or shorter time pets and other 
animals, plants, flowers, and various natural and manu- 
factured objects of significance. A rich play life is provided, 
and the children reproduce dramatically some of the ex- 
periences they have had, organize them into representative 
action, and thus further deepen and clarify the ideas gained.

A “show” was proposed by one boy, who then got others to assist in laying out the “room” with blocks, The entertainment consisted of showing pictures and telling stories. The audience is evidently interested in this number on the improvised program. 
It is often claimed that children get all this in their home 
and family life, and of course this may be true as regards 
certain individuals. But such studies as G. Stanley Hall’s 
Content of Children’s Minds, and the testimony of hundreds 
of teachers in the lower grades, bear witness to the pathetic 
meagerness and ludicrous distortion of the mental furnishing 
of a great many of the younger children. Although passing 
out of the period of infancy, the world is still something 
of a “booming buzzing confusion,” to use William James’s 
expression, and the nebulous state of their minds interferes 
with our overzealous efforts to turn them toward symbols 
and abstractions. 
There is much opposition to the strenuous crowding of the 
three R’s in first-grade work, but if this must still be done 
let us at least provide a year in the kindergarten for all 
children, so that they shall be assured a full life of play and 
vital experience, and then let us continue a fair measure of 
similar activities all through the primary years. 
     
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE PLACE OF THE KINDERGARTEN 61 
The delightful introduction to literature which a good 
kindergarten gives is of the utmost value to beginners in 
reading. It is the exceptional child who possesses a great 
many of the choicest books and pictures suited to his years, 
and only the most favored home conditions make possible 
an early acquaintance with the best in literature for the 
child world. Many mothers are totally unprepared to pro- 
vide the material for such delight and instruction, and 
others are so busy with the multitudinous cares attendant 
upon the physical needs of the family that scant time is left 
for the story-hour. 
Kindergarten pupils become acquainted with the charm- 
ing and whimsical characters in Mother Goose. Many of 
the rhymes are readily learned “by heart.’’ A marvelous 
procession of animals, birds, and human beings marches 
through this wonderful old book, and many great artists 
have thought it worthy of their best efforts to depict the 
fascinating scenes suggested by the rhymes. In like manner 
delightful old folk and fairy tales, the most suitable modern 
verse, and the choicest realistic stories are presented, and by 
the time the children are ready to encounter some of this 
material in primer and first reader they are possessed of a 
background which will make them more intelligent and 
appreciative readers. They will carry to their books clearer 
ideas, a better basis for association of symbols with mean- 
ings, a quickened sense of humor, a better notion of plot 
and sequence, and will experience fewer obstacles when 
they attempt to master the complex art of interpreting the 
printed page. 
Numper Experience 
The demand that the kindergarten shall definitely lay a 
foundation for primary arithmetic is less insistent than 
formerly because in many places the direct teaching of
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
number is no longer begun in the first grade, but is post- 
poned to the second year. It is obviously illogical to exact 
of the kindergarten what has been eliminated from the next 
grade. By the time pupils reach the second grade, no one 
knows where they have “picked up” the information along 
‘arithmetical lines which they possess— whether in the 
kindergarten, the first grade, at home, or in the street. 
There is no doubt that much teaching of number, con- 
scious and unconscious, goes on in thé kindergarten, 
since, wherever human beings are actively and thought- 
fully engaged with materials and things, number experi- 
ence is an inevitable part of the activity. So far as ac- 
tual personal need and genuine opportunity are concerned 
the kindergarten children are in a much better situation to 
get effective lessons in number than are pupils in a primary 
class patterned along formal, conventional lines. Kinder- 
garten children employ an abundance and variety of ma- 
terial in purposeful ways estimating, selecting, shaping, 
and adapting it to their needs; hence quantitative experience 
is ever present. Often it rises prominently to the surface 
and pupils become keenly conscious of certain facts and re- 
lationships. There is at this stage an instinctive tendency 
to count which satisfies itself in enumerating children, 
blocks, beads, places at table, chairs, plates, and whatever 
comes to hand. There are many occasions where counting 
and estimating are really necessary and teachers bring these 
needs to the consciousness of the children. The conception 
of arithmetic teaching developed in Chapter XIV is ad- 
mirably realized in many kindergartens where, through the 
genuine uses of the day, abundant number experiences ap- 
propriate to the kindergarten period are obtained. Formal 
drill at this stage is neither necessary nor desirable. Perhaps 
the most important contribution which the kindergarten 
and first grade can make in beginning arithmetic is the  
-P-A-G-E-65
  
  THE PLACE OF THE KINDERGARTEN 53 
development of some of the most fundamental number con- 
cepts, such as more, less, as much as, long, longer, add to, take 
from, equal. The unfamiliar language involved in mathe- 
matics has been found to be a serious handicap to beginners, 
and it can be easily and naturally acquired only in concrete 
use. 
Just as children learn to make use of pencil, brush, needle, 
hammer, and loom, so they learn to employ number as a 
tool in their own interesting daily life. They help to make 
small purchases for individual and class use, contribute 
pennies to special objects, sell their handicraft products for 
benefit funds, learn how to pay car fare, and thus get a 
working knowledge of low-value coins and their relation. 
Penny. savings-banks are encouraged, and children are 
taught to save part of their pennies and to spend in more 
worth-while ways what has heretofore gone for chewing-gum, 
cheap candy and cakes, and flimsy, catch-penny trinkets. 
It is possible in this period to start sound though rudimen- 
tary ideas of thrift. A definite number of pennies and 
nickels converted into milk enough to save a starving baby 
for a week, another sum transformed into a beautiful big 
new ball for the kindergarten, another personal collection 
invested in a coveted humming top or bright picture book — 
such experiences, constantly occurring and brought to con- 
sciousness, constitute as definite training in arithmetic as 
does learning to add two and two. 
Strict Froebelians of the old school attempted to impart 
the rudiments of mathematics through teaching fractional 
parts of the cube; the number of faces, edges, corners of the 
cube; square inches in a surface laid with parquetry squares; 
multiples of three, four, etc., appearing in symmetrical 
figures. They felt also that it was of high importance that 
young children should know by name many geometrical 
forms both solid and surface, and how they are derived one

  54 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
from another. There was nothing really functional about 
any of this work, since what the children did with their 
materials was for no purpose of their own either in play or 
practical life. A good part of the mathematical facts which 
the children got thus had no application whatever in later 
primary work, and in some directions went far beyond the 
requirements of an exacting course in first- and second- 
grade arithmetic. 
Minimmat EssentIAys 
For some years there has been much agitation regarding 
the question of evolving some statement of a minimum in 
achievement to be expected of the kindergarten. If by 
“minimal essentials” is meant the status necessary for pro- 
motion to first grade, it is obvious that such a scheme is 
impractical so long as kindergartens are not provided for all 
children and attendance is not compulsory in those which 
do exist. Consider a hypothetical case. Charles Smith 
attends kindergarten for a year and in June is nearly six 
years old, but in achievement is so far below the standard 
set that he is not recommended for promotion. Instead, he 
is expected to return to the kindergarten for another term. 
Mary Jones, who lives next door to the Smiths, does not 
attend kindergarten at all, but in September, being of 
proper age, is presented for admission to the first grade. 
We will suppose that she is in no respect superior to the 
other child, but she is accepted without question, since she 
does not show herself to be distinctly subnormal in intelli- 
gence. She is not subjected to any of the standards which 
would debar her playmate, although she would have failed 
had there been the same “entrance requirements” for chil- 
_dren coming directly from the home. From the standpoint 
of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, their boy is penalized for attending 
kindergarten, and of course they will not submit to this.
-P-A-G-E-67
    THE PLACE OF THE KINDERGARTEN 55 
Few people take the position that attendance at kinder- 
garten should be made compulsory for all children. That 
being the case, chronological age, together with a reasonable 
use_of intelligence tests, will probably continue for some 
time to be the basis for promotion from the kindergarten as 
well as for entrance to the first grade from the home. 
If, however, by “minimal essentials” is meant a state- 
ment of reasonable achievement to be expected of kinder- 
garten pupils, and if pup'ls attaining such standards may 
upon promotion be treated differently from children who 
have never attended kindergarten, then there is some object 
in working out such a scheme. In any school large enough 
to have several first grades, pupils promoted from the 
kindergarten on the ‘basis of demonstrated ability should 
be kept for at least one term in a separate class. They 
should be given an opportunity to show in what respects 
they differ from non-kindergarten children and from those 
sent on merely because their chronological age determined 
promotion. Such an arrangement would spur kindergarten 
supervisors and teachers to make clearer and more specific 
statements of their course of study and standards for pro- 
motion, and would cause them to be much more careful to 
check up and record tangible results of the year’s work. 
So long as the best-trained kindergarten pupils are classified 
exactly as if they had never attended school, and so long 
as the curriculum and methods of our first grades are 
planned exclusively for veritable beginners, it seems both 
unfair and futile to insist that kindergarten workers shall 
hold themselves responsible for specific, demonstrable 
achievement of pupils. On the other hand, so long as 
kindergartners are content to go along making no definite 
statement of objectives and results and no protest against 
the leveling process which reduces an apt pupil after a year 
of regular attendance to exactly the same status as an un-
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
trained child from street and home, they have small ground 
for complaint against the prevailing custom. 
Tue Service oF THE KINDERGARTEN IN CLASSIFICATION 
or Pupis 
There is strong evidence that the kindergarten will in the 
near future be recognized as having one great function, that 
of a “recruiting station” for our schools. Dr. Gesell! uses 
this term in his very interesting treatment of the question 
of school entrance. He shows how great a service might be 
rendered by the kindergarten if it could become the main 
agent through which all other child-welfare agencies of a 
neighborhood might operate. He says: 
The whole problem of the function of the kindergarten comes to 
a crux when we inquire, What should be the relation of the kinder- 
garten to school entrance? If the kindergarten has no vital busi- 
ness in this field, it may be questioned whether it should be part of 
our public school system at all. 
No feature of public school administration is apparently under 
less control than that of school entrance. ... We annually recruit 
three millions of school children into our great educational camp 
without meeting the hygienic responsibilities and opportunities 
involved. 
And what is the relation of the kindergarten to this great re- 
sponsibility, and still greater opportunity? 
In weighing this question let us visualize the kindergarten as an 
intermediate station, or a corridor which lies between the first two 
epochs of childhood — the pre-school period and the school period. 
The kindergarten derives much of its power, indeed, from the fact 
that it lies within the borders of the pre-school epoch, which, all 
things considered, is the most important period in the whole span 
of development. 
The problems of pre-school hygiene and of school entrance are 
inseparable, and both are in turn inseparable from the kinder- 
garten. The whole matter of school entrance is in last analysis   
1Gesell, Arnold: The Pre-School Child, chap. v. Houghton Mifflin 
Company, 1923.
-P-A-G-E-69
  THE PLACE OF THE KINDERGARTEN 57 
one of hygiene. Matriculation into school life should be condi- 
tioned primarily by standards of health and development; and 
should be regulated by a policy of medical oversight and educa- 
tional observation. Instead of unceremoniously and haphazardly 
admitting three millions of children and failing one fourth of our 
first-graders at the end of the first year, we should gradually re- 
organize the kindergarten and the primary school in such a way 
that the school beginner will be under systematic, purposeful ob- 
servation. This means a gradual relaxation of our present zeal to 
“teach” him, and the substitution of a much more wholesome so- 
licitude, namely, one to safeguard his health and to understand his 
psychology. 
The kindergarten is admirably fitted for the development of a 
policy of observation of school beginners leading to a hygienic con- 
trol of school entrance. The kindergarten and first grade should 
be gradually reorganized in a manner to bring at least the first half 
of school life under systematic, purposeful scrutiny. Teachers, 
program, schedule, equipment, and medical inspection could be 
adapted to this end. There should be an induction period, with a 
system of record-keeping, and classification of pupils to determine 
their immediate educational treatment and their subsequent treat- 
ment in the grades. 
Many schools are making wise use of intelligence tests in 
the kindergarten for purposes of diagnosis and classification. 
Where such tests are properly administered at the beginning 
and the end of the kindergarten year, there is no doubt that 
much more homogeneous groups are obtained for first-grade 
work. It is commonly accepted that a single intelligence 
test, given to a large group of children upon entrance to 
first grade, is not a very reliable measure of their ability 
and that very faulty classification is apt to result. But a 
year in kindergarten, with several such tests applied and the 
results supplemented by the teacher’s judgment, constitutes 
probably the best basis now available for satisfactory organ- 
ization of classes for the succeeding year’s work. Correct 
indication in this way of individual differences in native 
ability and in maturity would undoubtedly eliminate much

waste in the first grade where there is at present an exces- 
sive amount of retardation. 
Can Mrasurasr& Resutts in Supsect-Marrer 
BE SHOWN? 
It must be admitted at once that scarcely anything has 
been accomplished in the way of standardized achievement 
tests for the kindergarten. At first glance it may seem that 
leaders in this field have been very unresponsive to recent 
tendencies in education and very slow to make use of scien- 
tific measurement. Further consideration will show, how- 
ever, that their situation in this regard is but little different 
from that of the early primary division of the school. It 
is a well-known fact that there are very few group tests for 
measuring achievement that are of any value in the first 
grade, and these touch in a limited way only the most formal 
elements of the child’s accomplishment. Many competent 
judges are skeptical regarding the results of any group test 
in reading for first-grade children, and there is nothing 
available in arithmetic or language that is reliable. Further- 
more, arithmetic is quite often omitted from the required 
course for the first grade, so why try to measure the results? 
The most ardent advocate of scientific measurement would 
hardly insist upon attempting to rate the first uncertain 
attempts of six-year-olds in handwriting. It is interesting 
to note that in the numerous school surveys which have 
been made in recent years achievement tests are very little 
used below the third grade. Considering the fact that there 
has always been urgent demand upon primary grades for a 
good deal of formal drill work, the results of which should be 
readily amenable to measurement, this is not a particularly 
convincing showing for standardized scales in lower grades. 
Every one is familiar with the fact that even for the upper 
gri.ties of the elementary school the merest beginning has  
-P-A-G-E-71
  
  THE PLACE OF THE KINDERGARTEN 59 
been made in measuring anything but the skill side of the tool 
subjects. In the field represented by the richer content 
subjects, such as history, science, literature, and that of es- 
sential social and personal habits and attitudes, compara- 
tively little has been accomplished in measurement. 
In the light of these well-known facts little should be 
expected in the way of achievement tests for kindergarten 
children from four to six years of age. They are not only 
too immature to respond en masse, as such tests require, but 
the curriculum almost universally conceded to be suitable 
and right for them does not call for much along the line 
of easily measurable skills. 
Inrormat Recorps or Resutts 
Should inability to measure achievement by standardized 
scales excuse the kindergarten from attempting to give some 
sort of satisfactory account of results? Only the less 
thoughtful and less competent teachers wish to be exempt 
from a clear accounting, for it is evident that such exemption 
encourages the prevalent tendency to ignore or disparage 
their work. For many years leaders have been striving to 
evolve curricula fully in harmony with the most progressive 
ideas in education and well calculated to lay the foundation 
for the primary course. In a number of places there are 
definite specifications regarding the amount and kind of 
work in literature, music, games, art, industrial arts, nature 
study, hygiene, and civics which the kindergarten is expected 
to deal with efficiently. The best practice permits and 
encourages in addition free choice from a wide range of 
subject-matter and experience. In a few places reports of 
ground covered are sent on with pupils promoted from the 
kindergarten. Such reports consist of titles of stories and 
songs which they know best, poems which they have mem- 
orized, games which they are capable of conducting alo 9, a
-P-A-G-E-72
  
60 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
statement of points in hygiene emphasized, and fundamen- 
tal habits believed to be fairly well established — especially 
such habits as are of pronounced importance in the school- 
room. Occasionally specimens of the children’s work are 
sent on to the first grade. Included in these reports should 
be found also brief records of the most significant first-hand 
experiences which the children have had, such as excursions 
and the resulting class activities. 
Indications that the traditional isolation of the kinder- 
garten is being overcome are to be found in reports and 
syllabi from centers where the most earnest consideration 
has been given to this matter for many years. Among the 
centers which have evolved some clear statements of ob- 
jectives and evidences of attainment may be mentioned the 
public schools of Trenton, New Jersey; Louisville, Ken- 
tucky; Kalamazoo, Michigan; Kansas City, Missouri; 
Lincoln, Nebraska; Duluth, Minnesota; and Fort Wayne, 
Indiana. 
Is 4 Continuous CurricuLuM PRoviDED FOR 
KINDERGARTEN AND Primary GRADES? 
Judging by an examination of over one hundred courses 
of study published between 1908 and 1918, in cities widely 
distributed over the United States, one must infer that the 
usual practice has been to ignore the kindergarten in cur- 
riculum-making. The investigation showed that in many 
cities having a printed course of study for the elementary 
school, there were no printed outlines of any kind for the 
kindergarten. In some cases a brief outline appeared on a 
separate sheet, but it was usually evident that the course 
had no definite relation to that provided for the rest of 
the school. It seems clear that primary teachers were not 
expected to be informed regarding the work of the kinder- 
garten, This attitude has fostered the idea that the kinder-

garten year was not to be regarded as an integral part of the 
school life. 
Reliable data were obtained from eighty-one cities known 
to have public kindergartens, and an analysis of the facts 
is shown in the accompanying table.

four sections of the United States. These were published between the years 1908 and 1918. 
Column I shows that twenty-eight out of thirty-nine cities in New England and Atlantic 
Coast States made no reference to their kindergartens. Column II shows that nine out of 
thirty-nine made some slight incidental reference to the kindergarten. Column ITI shows 
that two out of thirty-nine gave at least a small section to the kindergartens. Totals in the 
country at large, forty-nine cities out of eighty-one made no mention, twenty made slight 
reference, twelve treated kindergartens as integral parts of the school system. Eighty-five 
per cent (sixty plus twenty-five) of all courses of study examined made little or no reference 
to the kindergartens.

62 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
In many cases the investigators could not tell from the 
course of study whether there were kindergartens in a given 
city or not. They were obliged to consult the superin- 
tendent’s annual report, where (if kindergartens existed) 
they were mentioned in the financial section and in the list 
of teachers. When the superintendent’s report was not 
available, they consulted a sheet published by the United 
States Bureau of Education, which lists the cities having 
public school kindergartens. Fancy having to make such 
a search in order to ascertain whether there were high 
schools in a given city! This investigation tells the tale of 
isolation very graphically. It may be argued that in most 
instances there were issued adequate outlines in a separate 
bulletin which the files examined did not include. A suffi- 
cient answer to that is obtained by examining the opening 
paragraphs under every heading in the main course of study. 
Under English, Literature, Music, Hygiene, Art, Arith- 
metic, etc., it is the rarest thing that any reference whatever 
is found to the year’s work in the kindergarten. In almost 
every instance the first grade is quite evidently thought of 
as furnishing the very first steps in these subjects. If a 
separate bulletin for the kindergartens were relied upon to 
describe the initial work, and if the results were to be taken 
into account, the attention of primary teachers would cer- 
tainly be directed to this fact and some recognition would be 
made of steps already accomplished. 
An extensive survey covering many phases of our schools 
was made recently by the National Committee of Chamber 
of Commerce Coéperation with the Public Schools and the 
‘American City Bureau. The part concerned with kinder- 
garten-primary education was never published, but the 
present writer has had an opportunity to examine the care- 
fully compiled results.1_ One question was, “What per-

If the four Western cities reporting are typical, that sec- 
tion is decidedly in advance in attempting to relate the work 
of the kindergarten more closely to that of the primary 
grades by means of a unified curriculum. 
If these two surveys could be made again there is every 
reason to believe that the showing for the whole coun- 
try would be decidedly better. Some exceptionally good 
courses of study published since 1920 assign to the kinder- 
garten a certain definite responsibility in the total work of 
the elementary school. They give evidence also of having 
been planned to a considerable extent by committees rep- 
resenting all departments concerned. 
A new departure in curriculum-making is seen in the type 
which endeavors to point the path of growth and to indicate 
some of the steps, in terms of behavior or conduct rather 
than in the customary terms of subject-matter and skill. 
Such a curriculum has just been prepared by a committee of 
kindergarten and first-grade teachers codperating with Miss 
Patty S. Hill.! This piece of work is the outgrowth of 
years of study and experiment in the effort to discover what 
1A Conduct Curriculum for the Kindergarten and First Grade. Charles 
Scribner’s Sons, 1923.
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
are the most important and desirable habits for young chil- 
dren to acquire and through what specific situations these 
habits may best be established. This curriculum attempts 
to keep experience in direct and essential relation to the de- 
sired attitudes and habits of the learner. It is not intended 
as a complete and all-inclusive curriculum for these years, 
but it furnishes: a much-needed emphasis on a kind of 
growth which the conventional course of study has largely 
neglected. 
INFLUENCES wHicH TEND TOwARD Berrer CoOrDINATION 
Our most progressive training schools are now giving a 
kind of preparation which fits students about equally well 
as teachers of either kindergarten or primary grades. No 
matter which lines they follow later, they will carry with 
them a sympathetic understanding of the whole range of 
early education. Large numbers of students whose earlier 
training was of the more limited type are now seeking 
through advanced study to gain a more comprehensive 
outlook. 
It is becoming less common every year to have two super- 
visors, one for the kindergartens and another for primary 
grades. Such a scheme often encourages further separation 
and sometimes results in actual discord and unwholesome 
rivalry. The only rational plan is to treat the kinder- 
garten-primary grades as one department and put in charge 
a supervisor thoroughly trained and experienced in both 
fields who can command the respect of different groups of 
teachers and draw them together for efficient codperation. 
A more generous attitude toward the primary grades in 
the matter of space, equipment, and enriched curriculum is 
gradually developing, and this tends to lessen the handicap 
which these grades have always suffered as compared with 
the kindergarten. 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  
THE PLACE OF THE KINDERGARTEN 65 
Educational organizations local and national, which for- 
merly pursued rather narrow lines of study and endeavor, 
have shown for some years a marked disposition to widen 
their range. This has resulted in drawing kindergarten and 
primary teachers much more closely together for the con- 
sideration of their common problems. It is a very rare 
thing to-day for the International Kindergarten Union or 
the National Council of Primary Education to prepare a 
program dealing with the kindergarten or the primary field 
alone. They are working together in an attempt to de- 
velop the kind of education which is right for children at 
all stages of growth. 
QUESTIONS 
1. Why is it important to keep progress records of some kind in 
kindergarten? 
2. If there are no achievement tests for kindergarten pupils, 
how can fitness for a higher grade be determined? 
38. Is it probable that general and systematic teaching of reading 
all through the kindergarten would greatly reduce the “‘fail- 
ures” in first grade? 
4. Show how acquaintance with picture books and stories and 
rich and varied experiences may be of real assistance in learn- 
ing to read. 
5. Should there be a continuous curriculum for kindergarten and 
primary grades? Who should construct this curriculum?

CHAPTER IV 
HAVE CHILDREN’S PURPOSES AND PLANS A RIGHTFUL 
PLACE IN THE CURRICULUM? 
Mention has already been made of the peculiarly barren 
life, foreign to the nature of children, which still persists in a 
great many primary schools. Even those which on the sur- 
face appear to have provided a fairly rich curriculum often 
seem to have left quite out of account the child’s native ways 
of searching for and appropriating knowledge and skill. 
The learner as active agent seems to be forgotten in many 
fine schemes of curriculum-making. 
It is a well-known fact that, as each new subject or art is 
introduced into the school for the purpose of broadening the 
children’s experience and increasing the points of contact 
with the best that life affords, the cold hand of formalism 
reaches out and slowly squeezes the very breath of life cut 
of the subject or activity. It becomes only another highly 
organized study, artificial in character, to be imposed upon 
teachers and dealt out to pupils in carefully measured por- 
tions. Or, if this is thought to be too dark a picture, let us 
say that these promised enrichments of the curriculum have 
failed of the best results because they have usually been 
over-formalized and administered in logical sequence with 
too little regard for the ordinary uses and needs of children. 
Drawing, modeling, story-telling, dramatization, dancing, 
music, and even industrial arts, have experienced this dead- 
ening process to a greater or less degree. All too rarely has 
a way been found to expose young pupils to the fascination 
of such arts, to invite participation in them, and encourage 
their free appropriation and use in satisfying personal and 
group desires and purposes. Still less have the stiff, stub-

  CHILDREN’S PURPOSES AND PLANS 67 
born, and ancient arts of reading, writing, and arithmetic 
been made to take such modest and immediately serviceable 
rank in the daily life of school children. 
James Harvey Robinson! writes as follows in his intro- 
duction to A Mother's Letters to a Schoolmaster. The boy 
“ Peter” mentioned in the passage is the child about whom 
the letters were written. 
... if viable learning is to take place, it must be consistently as- 
sociated with the vivid experiences and functioning of the learner. 
Hitherto we have made the fatal mistake of relying too exclusively 
upon mere reading, memorizing, and the specious rewards or pun- 
ishments of school routine. The old method is, of course, recom- 
mended by its convenience in dealing with large classes, and as our 
theories change, the whole organization of the school must un- 
dergo radical reconstruction. ... Peter was mystified by the quiet- 
ness of the schoolroom, and wondered how any one could be learn- 
ing much when the pupils seemed to be doing so little. . . . 
Human knowledge is as yet very crudely classified from the 
standpoint of human needs. Our “subjects” and academic “de- 
partments” form insuperable barriers to real learning. Our pars- 
ings, conjugations, boundings, tables, axioms, principles, can never 
be expected to form the entering wedge of understanding; they 
may sometimes be the outcome of it in peculiarly logical minds. 
Human experience, curiosity, and longings do not fall under the 
natural headings of reading, writing, mathematics, geography, 
chemistry, physics, botany, politics, economics, history. Life 
does not meet us under these captions. We must therefore devise 
others that are closer to the heart of man.... Every child can 
readily enough and spontaneously enough think in terms of eating, 
his house and his clothes, his play, his fondness for beautiful things, 
his curiosity about the world, about buying and selling, getting 
back and forth, where things come from, and how they come about. 
These are good enough categories for us at any age when we are not 
engaged in the rare occupation of scientific specialization. When 
we think in these and similar terms, we get active, self-propagating 
ideas which promise to turn into intelligence and understanding 
and wise conduct.

68 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL | 
Conscious of this tendency of organized subject-matter | 
and developed arts to go their own way and of the adult 
mind to fall in comfortably with this course, thoughtful, 
progressive school people have for a long time sought to 
break up the formally organized mass of subject-matter into 
units of more personal significance to children. They have 
tried to find centers outside the recognized fundamental sub- 
jects which would touch the lives of the children more closely 
and make for greater unity and continuity in the curric- 
ulum. To this end, the study of Indian life, Eskimo life, 
Colonial life, or other phase of history or human experience 
have been made the basis of organization. Such topics be- 
come for a time the point of departure for teaching both the 
formal subjects and expressive arts. The ideas presented 
often take concrete form in miniature Indian or Eskimo 
villages with appropriate primitive tools and implements, 
dramatic and representative play and costume-making, the 
laying-out of a pioneer settlement and imitation of primitive 
ways of doing things, ete. Or, seeking to get further back 
into the inner impulses of children and through these to ap- 
proach the school arts, many attempts have been made to 
draw upon common play experiences for motivation; a play- 
house to be furnished and decorated by the entire class; a 
toy circus to be made, with animals of wood, cardboard, or 
cloth; a miniature farm with block buildings, fences, family, 
animals, and imitation crops; a grocery store to be equipped, 
stocked, and staffed for business, etc. 
To the extent that these schemes are the children’s own 
either by reason of their suggestion or by willing and eager 
adoption at the suggestion of another; to the extent that 
they are largely planned and carried through by the chil- 
dren, thoughtfully and with constant exhibition of initiative 
and responsible ownership, they are children’s projects 
whether they have been so named in the past or not. And
-P-A-G-E-81
  CHILDREN’S PURPOSES AND PLANS 69 
conversely, to the extent that they are teacher-planned and 
controlled, guided by anxious eyes fixed upon outward re- 
sults and meticulous care for effect; to the extent that the 
scheme is simply an ingenious carrier for less interesting 
matter, introduced to lighten a dull routine — it is no true 
child’s project or problem whatever it may be called. 
Wuar CHARACTERISTICS MUST AN ENTERPRISE Possess TO 
Renver 1t Wortny oF A PLACE IN THE ScHooL PRoGRAM? 
To be of great worth, it must either be initiated by the 
children or it must offer them rich opportunities for the 
origination of subsidiary features. It does not matter so 
much who first thinks of an enterprise. The important 
questions are, Will the children have the spirit, the ability, 
and the freedom to take over to a(@®nsiderable extent the 
formation and execution of a plan? “Will it quickly become 
their affair depending largely for success upon their enthu- 
siasm and sustained effort? 
The pseudo child-project is usually suggested by the 
teacher, planned, “cut and dried” by her, the whole scheme 
being well determined from the beginning. In consequence 
the children have small chance to contribute ideas or to 
carry real responsibility. Much of the exhibition work in 
our schools is of this character. This one point, as to who 
is the chief agent, is very important, because on it depends 
the development of leadership, self-reliance, straight think- 
ing, and right social behavior. 
To be clearly deserving of a place in the school program, 
the child’s project should also be seen to align itself, at least 
in a rudimentary way, with one or more of the great fields 
- of human endeavor and achievement, and it must involve 
situations and questions which will call for real thinking. 
To illustrate: A boy proposes to collect tobacco tags, and 
through the exercise of a certain quality of leadership he
-P-A-G-E-82
  70 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
succeeds in organizing a group of boys to codperate with 
him. They match and exchange tags and succeed in getting 
a large collection. Under the criticism of the group, in- 
cluding (for purposes of argument) some older person, these 
boys may even develop better ideas of square dealing and 
business honor. Still, this would scarcely be considered a 
worthy school project, since it is entirely disconnected from 
any great field of knowledge and achievement, and since the 
by-products of the scheme are so uncertain and meager. 
In contrast to this, a boy becomes interested in butter- 
flies. He asks questions, consults books, and learns about 
the life-history of butterflies. He starts a collection or be- 
gins to check in his butterfly book the pictures and descrip- 
tions of those which he has found. He learns to identify 
different kinds at various stages and how to rear from the 
caterpillar stage some specimens which he has failed to find. 
In doing this he learns also how to identify certain plants 
on which particular caterpillars feed and ascertain where 
these plants are to be found. Questions calling for further 
inquiry are constantly arising and other children and some 
grown-ups are likely to be: drawn into the scheme. An 
interesting objective is given for many excursions to the 
country and much healthy exercise and wholesome pleasure 
are obtained. If properly guided, the children learn to 
handle living things humanely. One such interest with its 
many aspects may lead out into a gradually widening field 
of natural science. 
Another illustration: A boy proposes to give a “show” 
with the reflectoscope. This actually occurred in the first 
grade in the Horace Mann School. He got other children to 
agree to help furnish pictures for the affair, and together 
they produced a goodly array of drawings illustrating 
Mother Goose and popular stories. The teacher printed 
captions dictated by the artists and the manager, and other
-P-A-G-E-83
  CHILDREN’S PURPOSES AND PLANS 7 
children sorted and arranged the pictures. They introduced 
also a few photographs and picture postals of special per- 
sonal and class interest. When the “show”’ came off, the 
teacher had to operate the machine, but the manager handed 
out the pictures as arranged and the audience read the cap- 
tions. At times individuals who had furnished certain spe- 
cial pictures volunteered some explanation or account. This 
scheme called for initiative and codperation, for careful, 
thoughtful planning, for the exercise of skill in drawing and 
standards in selecting, so that the pictures would be under- 
stood and enjoyed, and an interesting exercise in reading 
was furnished. The teacher’s part did not slow down and 
outweigh the children’s activity, because it was not arti- 
ficially dragged in, was not overdone, and was in line with 
what is constantly experienced in moving-picture shows. 
Such an interest once launched and happily consummated 
has limitless possibilities for future development as the chil- 
dren mature. Evidence of this was shown by a successful 
and very fruitful effort on the part of the third grade in the 
same school in producing, by means of the reflectoscope and 
explanatory remarks, the story of Jeanne d’Arc in well- 
organized and very interesting form. The children being 
older in this case, the affair from beginning to end was more 
entirely their own. 
In Wuat Ways vo Prosects HAvING EDUCATIVE 
Possipinitiss ARISE 
Does some child suddenly, spontaneously, and out of a 
vacuum announce that he proposes to undertake a certain 
thing, or make a motion that the class launch such and such 
a scheme? Certainly not in the traditional school. The 
ways in which such activities start in school may be almost 
as varied as those by which adult activities are launched in 
the world of affairs. :
-P-A-G-E-84
  72 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
In the most rudimentary stage and with the youngest 
children, given freedom and materials of a plastic kind, 
multitudes of ideas spring up suggested by the experiences 
of the children and the nature of the material. The mere 
presence of clay, blocks, wood, hammers, nails, dolls, toy 
animals, books, crayons, etc., serves to stimulate numerous 
and varied reactions. Gradually these reactions, which 
were at first scarcely more than random manipulation of 
material, clarify into more definite and purposeful acts, and 
what started as individual play enlarges to include a number 
of children. A free organization of the group with natural 
social contacts leads to borrowing of ideas, improvement of 
technique, and a general raising of standards. Add to these 
tendencies the well-timed question and criticism of the 
teacher, and rudimentary manipulation will, before the end 
of the first year in kindergarten, become organized group 
activity of a purposeful sort involving at different times 
practically every phase of the curriculum. 
Immature first-grade pupils, or those who have had very 
meager experience with suggestive materials, may begin in 
the same way, but this stage should be very brief. They 
soon become responsive to questions, suggestions, and to the 
sight of older pupils and adults at work along the same lines. 
Models, visits to museums, books, and other stimulating 
influences such as we constantly meet in natural outside 
life, inspire pupils six or seven years of age and younger to 
set going numerous plans quite as good from the educational 
standpoint as any that a committee of experts could devise 
for a prescribed curriculum. Indeed, their propositions are 
often better because suffused with deep personal significance 
and the sense of proprietorship and responsibility. 
Teachers who have had much experience in conducting 
work of this sort testify that second- and third-grade pupils 
rarely set up projects merely by the line of least resistance,
-P-A-G-E-85
  CHILDREN’S PURPOSES AND PLANS 73 
that of direct response to the presence of materials of a 
certain type. On the contrary, they have clearly arrived at 
the more mature process of conceiving of a desired end and 
seeking the proper means and methods for its satisfactory 
execution. Since direct concrete stimulation plays now such 
a small part in giving initiation and direction to the child’s 
voluntary activities, and since conscious purposes of a wor- 
thy sort must control, how are these to be insured in suffi- 
cient force and variety? 
  
    
Fic. 8. Free Raytumic Exerctsss, Los Feu Scuoor, Los ANGELES, Cau. 
Even where climate and other conditions favor out-of-door life, many schools keep children 
closely housed except at recess. Los Feliz School, Los Angeles, makes good use of open 
spaces. These children are giving a free rhythmic interpretation to music furnished by 
the Victrola which has been wheeled into the yard. 
We must remember that children are members of a family, 
individuals in the larger school family, a part of the neigh- 
borhood community, and citizens of the world. It is to 
these wider relations, then, and not just to the restricted 
limits of the classroom that we must look for lines of interest
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
toward which to direct thought and effort. To the extent 
that vigorous currents from these wide fields are kept flowing 
freely through the school, will a wealth of profitable ques- 
tions and proposals arise for solution and execution. As 
members of a family, there are toys to be made for younger 
children, stories to be learned to tell at home, serviceable 
articles to produce, an entertainment to prepare for mothers 
and fathers. As individuals and groups in the larger school 
family, there are rooms, building, and grounds to care for 
and beautify, assembly programs to prepare, a festival to 
celebrate, and occasions for the exchange of favors and 
courtesies between lower and upper classes. As members 
of the neighboring community, there may be a library, park, 
or museum with which to become acquainted, local move- 
ments with which to establish contact, the work of public 
servants to learn to know and appreciate, and perhaps a day 
nursery or children’s hospital to assist in various ways. And 
as citizens of the world, children should learn of the streams of 
benefit constantly converging toward them from the world’s 
work and of the obligation and delight of sharing their pleas- 
ures with other children and relieving their necessities. They 
cannot find the path in these larger and more complex mat- 
ters except as they are led by teachers with vision and insight. 
Many Ricu Oprortuntries ror Prosect Work 
ARE OVERLOOKED 
It is perfectly possible to introduce certain very vital and so. 
cially significant questions or movements into the school and 
permit or compel them to pursue their own single track and 
independent course, leaving the ordinary traditional curric- 
ulum arid and untouched. This was shown in many schools 
during the World War. The school authorities loyally and 
faithfully launched, directed, and successfully pushed the 
Junior Red Cross work, the Thrift Stamp campaign, Food
-P-A-G-E-87
  CHILDREN’S PURPOSES AND PLANS 1 
Conservation, and a multitude of other appealing and wor- 
thy interests. But often a narrow or myopic vision caused 
the school executives and teachers to see these movements 
singly and in relation only to patriotic feeling developed and 
quantity of bandages rolled, stamps bought, or Red Cross 
members secured. It is not intended to depreciate the im- 
portance of such results, especially in time of war, but they 
are not enough. The broader vision of other school execu- 
tives and teachers enabled them to see how they could ac- 
complish all of these ends and in addition help the children 
to find, in the specific purposes constantly to the front, the 
centers for organizing and vitalizing almost all of the school 
work. A school principal of the type first described was 
encountered during the time when schools were made dis- 
tributing centers for sugar. He remarked that all of his 
time was being absorbed in the labor of weighing, wrapping, 
selling, and accounting for sugar. Asked whether the upper 
grades of the school were not assisting in the undertaking, 
he said, “Goodness! No. I am spending all of my own 
time, but I can’t afford to let those boys and girls take theirs 
for such work.”” It would have been perfectly feasible and 
highly desirable for the older boys and girls to have organ- 
ized themselves into committees to assist in this business. 
With the supervision necessary in a matter of such com- 
plexity and public consequence, they could probably have 
accomplished more work in arithmetic than is usually cov- 
ered in the same time, to say nothing of the other values 
which would have accrued from voluntary, organized effort 
linked up with a big national question.

well as in their vocations. Children, too, may be said to 
have avocations, and no one can deny that they early de-

occupation. If the school will encourage and draw upon 
these resources, it will secure another strong impetus and 
guide to the pupils’ doing, thinking, and learning. In many

classes, children will be found who have already made a 
beginning in the care of pets, simple photography, playing 
musical instruments, printing, typewriting, gardening, simple 
mechanics, making valuable collections, and acquaintance 
with choice books. If encouraged to make free use of these 
gifts, tastes, and skills in school, such use will be found to ger- 
minate all kinds of related activities among the possessors 
and among the other children, and stimulating relations will 
be established with the so-called “regular” curriculum.
-P-A-G-E-89
  CHILDREN’S PURPOSES AND PLANS 77 
The play life of children, touching as it does on almost 
every phase of human experience, should have full recogni- 
tion. Purposes which arise here are just as serious from the 
child’s standpoint as those of older people, and if properly 
guided may be just as productive of situations calling for 
thought, skill, and knowledge. In place of clay marbles and 
doll dishes made in the kindergarten will come later beauti- 
fully decorated beads, bowls, and plates burned in the kiln 
and permanently serviceable; the crude doll furniture be- 
comes skilled cabinet-work; crude doll clothes and un- 
hemmed aprons and blouses for painting, as made in the 
kindergarten, become the skirt and middy of the upper- 
grade girl; and poring over charming picture books should 
lead into reading and enjoying good literature. 
To some extent schools are endeavoring to help children 
to use their leisure time, especially their vacations, both 
happily and profitably. Thoughtful teachers and parents 
know that, if they can get strong currents of interest moving 
from the school to the home and from home and family back 
to the school, life as a whole will be enriched. To this end 
schools are beginning to suggest in an informal way suitable 
undertakings for children for their vacations. Compara- 
tively few children have the opportunities enjoyed by those 
for whom the following suggestions were prepared, but the 
majority have a few summer experiences which would be 
worth recording. The Horace Mann School gets out a 
booklet called What Shall I do Now? Suggestions for Sum- 
mer Work and Play. In part the introduction reads as fol- 
lows: 
To the Girls and Boys: 
You have probably asked, ‘‘ What shall I do now?” many times 
in past vacations. In this little book we have tried to help you 
solve that problem. We have suggested work and play of different 
kinds; household tasks, sewing, cooking, carpentry, collections of

many sorts, games for evenings and for rainy days, and good books 
to read. 
We have listed certain occupations for each grade. ... What- 
ever work you do, save carefully and bring back to the school in the 
fall. Next October we expect to have an exhibition of your sum- 
mer work, and those who have done worth-while things will receive 
special credit. 
A variety of suggestions are offered for each grade. A 
few examples will be given from the first three. The quota- 
tions represent only a small fraction of the entire booklet 
and are not in consecutive order.

Collect pictures which you think beautiful. Your classmates 
may enjoy seeing them. 
Keep an outdoor record book. Put in it pressed flowers and 
»pictures of animals or insects doing interesting things. 
Perhaps you can keep a little aquarium of things you find in a 
pond. 
Second Grade 
Make a ship book of all the different kinds of ships you see. Col- 
lect pictures of the ships of other countries and of long ago. 
Keep a word book of all the new and interesting words you 
hear. 
Make a collection of something that interests you. Here are 
some suggestions: stones, shells, leaves, flowers, cocoons, stamps, 
coins, Indian arrowheads. 
Whenever you think of a good joke, story, or poem, dictate it to 
some one so we can read it in Story Hour. 
Get several children together and have a play. Make tickets 
and charge admission. Have some one take snapshots of the 
scenes. 
Third Grade 
Notice the kind of work that is going on about you. It may be 
farming or dairying, building or road-making, mining or lumbering.

You may visit a dock or a factory. Tell about the people who are 
working for us and whom we hardly know. Get pictures and snap- 
shots of these people at work. 
Make a play or puppet show of your favorite book. Make the 
costumes; take snapshots of the scenes. 
Have a question box in which you put all the worth-while ques- 
tions you think of during the summer. 
The fall exhibit at the school has brought abundant proof 
of the zeal and industry of the children in innumerable en- 
tertaining, educative, and broadening enterprises, and the 
effect upon the more highly organized part of the curric- 
ulum has been most helpful. 
It may be of interest to see how the same idea was carried 
out in a different environment. The following are a few 
items from Suggestions for the Summer, prepared for the 
second grade, in the State Normal School, San José, Cali- 
fornia, in 1923. The children evidently did a good deal to- 
ward compiling the list, for the opening sentence is: 
These are the suggestions you made about interesting things to 
do this summer. I have added a few. 
I. Make collections for an exhibit to be given in the fall. 
Make a collection of shells. Try to learn their names. 
Save post-cards showing any places visited. 
Take Kodak pictures of any interesting things you do or any- 
thing you make. Take pictures of your pets. 
If you have no Kodak, why not make your own pictures? 
Draw on wrapping-paper. 
Make a collection of pine cones. 
II. When you make something interesting save it for the exhibit. 
(Suggestions are offered for making toy-furniture, wagons, 
dolls’ clothes, and dolls.) 
III. Can you get a large packing-box for a playhouse? (Sugges- 
tions for use also as theater, store, engine-house, etc.) 
Many other stimulating ideas are conveyed by this sheet 
and one feels sure that many a happy and profitable hour

was spent by the children who belonged to this class. It is 
equally certain that much of the new experience fed right 
back into the school the following term.

Purposes 
There are families and homes where delightful and in- 
structive schemes and employments are constantly being 
launched and engaged in together; an impromptu picnic, a 
trip to the park, united earning and saving to purchase a 
Victrola or moving-picture machine, family concerts and 
entertainments, birthday parties and hearty festival cele- 
brations, the decision to own a dog or keep chickens with 
consequent planning and devising ways and means, a 
home library begun and developed, an evening reading-hour. 
Into these various plans, old and young throw themselves 
with happy zeal. Life in such homes is rich, various, and 
developing, and there is never a lack of worth-while things 
to do. 
Schools are like homes. They range all the way from the 
stiff, cold, and prison-like type, where everything moves ac- 
cording to military law, to those in which the life closely 
parallels that of the home just described. It is out of an en- 
riched school life with natural relations, vital common inter- 
ests, spontaneous suggestions, and friendly codperation that 
projects of educative value arise. Life in such a school is in 
some ways more like the pioneer home than the modern city 
home. Needs that arise become problems for solution, and 
children are led to find ways to supply their needs. If dolls 
are wanted, make them; if wagons are called for, construct 
them; if bookshelves and paper racks are needed, build them; 
if there is to be a Christmas play, write it and organize the 
dramatic action; if you wish a theater, build one with the 
big floor blocks and decorate it; if cookies are needed for the

party, make them, or at least help in the process; if you 
want a Valentine song for the party, compose it; if the doll’s 
clothes are soiled, wash them; if candles are called for on the 
birthday cake or Christmas tree, dip them; if you wish new 
stories, find them in the books at hand; if you want to be 
cashier at the sale, learn to make change accurately and 
quickly. 
Complete thinking is necessary in the face of a difficulty, 
and the developing project is usually full of difficulties of 
various kinds. The teacher who makes provision for chil- 
dren’s projects does not need to search for problems upon 
which they may sharpen their wits and learn to reason. 
Size, Scope AND GrnERAL Nature or DesIRABLE 
PRosects 
As suggested by some of the illustrations already given, 
children’s projects will vary greatly in size and in the number 
of people engaged in the effort. The four-year-old in the 
kindergarten may decide to make a picture with crayons. 
He may work alone at a small table for ten minutes, com- 
plete the picture, and never do anything further with it. In 
contrast to this, a class of thirty third-grade children may 
after some discussion decide to supply a baby with milk for 
an entire school term, and their united effort may occupy 
many hours of time and reach in innumerable directions 
both in and out of school. A full description of such a pro- 
ject is given in Chapter V. In this account it will be seen 
that the main undertaking, which enlisted the effort of all 
the children, called also for minor individual or smaller 
group contributions in order to carry the original purpose 
to a satisfactory consummation. 
In the light of known traits of childhood, school condi- 
tions, and our social ideals, it is not conceivable that there 
should be as many projects under way as there are
-P-A-G-E-95
  CHILDREN’S PURPOSES AND PLANS 83 
children in a given class. The latter tend very early to 
some codperative effort, and it is in such effort that oppor- 
tunity arises for training as useful members of organized 
society. Therefore, the more the chosen activities tend to 
run in channels calling for codperative effort and the larger 
the scope of the project, the better for educative purposes. 
We must not think of these voluntary and chosen activi- 
ties as being entirely of the motor or manual sort even in the 
early primary years. The defect of the term “‘project,” as 
applied to all self-instituted work, is that it was originally 
associated with manual and industrial arts, and was quite 
commonly applied to some unit in a fixed course of study in 
which little or no opportunity for choice was given to the 
upils. As has been said, a worthy project involves think- 
ing, and therefore intellectual processes will be prominent 
even in those which seem to be largely manual. But some 
purposes and plans lie more clearly in the recognized intel- 
lectual fields, and these are not neglected in schools organ- 
ized along this line. Some children early begin to choose the 
books, cards, puzzles, etc., which lead to reading, and apply 
themselves to mastering the art either for the sake of the 
stories or from pleasure in the process, or both. In the sec- 
ond grade they begin to get up reading groups or “clubs” 
which meet daily with a child-leader for voluntary reading. 
They put themselves through drill in arithmetic and spell- 
ing, sometimes impelled by the desire to prepare for some 
coveted office requiring such knowledge and skill and some- 
times from sheer pleasure in mastery and competitive effort. 
Again, there may be rigorous, self-imposed drill by individ- 
ual or group, because achievement in some subject has been 
discovered to be below standard. Printing apparatus is 
popular, and out of the original delight in manipulation of a 
new medium comes the later satisfaction in a new form of 
recording and communicating. Third- and fourth-grade ©

pupils will throw themselves with zeal into the study of a 
period in history in order to answer some question which 
interests them. They may eagerly pursue some problem in 
geography or nature study, going far beyond any require- 
ment a teacher would be disposed to make. 
In addition to this direct organization of the recognized 
school subjects into childlike units for study and practice, 
these subjects are constantly drawn upon in solving pro- 
blems and executing plans which originate and pursue their 
main course in some other field. For example, the story of 
Snow White is to be dramatized, and it must be read in 
several different books to see which version is preferred or to 
get a good composite version; a puppet show is to be given 
and the lines must be written for the puppeteers; posters are 
to be made advertising a performance and the words re- 
quired must be studied; boats are being made and the chil- 
dren pore over books to learn about primitive and modern 
methods of boat construction. 
How can ConFusion AND LAPSES IN THE COURSE OF 
Stupy Be AvoipEp? 
“But, after all,” it is asked, “what prevents the curric- 
ulum from being a perfect hodge-podge under such a method, 
and how does one ever know what has been accomplished?” 
To the first part of the question, one might justly parry with 
the query, “Is not the traditional curriculum a hodge-podge? 
Where did it come from? Is it not more or less of a patch- 
work construction brought together piecemeal from ancient 
and contemporary borrowings?” . But to reply more di- 
rectly and frankly, there is a real danger that the course of 
study under the proposed plan will lack consecutiveness. 
For this reason # is considered safer at present to provide a 
skeleton or outline course of study for each subject indicat- 
ing the knowledges, skills, and attitudes which valid experi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
CHILDREN’S PURPOSES AND PLANS 85 
ments and investigations have shown to be important at 
different stages of maturity. This is the longitudinal view 
of the more abstract phase of the curriculum. 
The most competent students of curriculum-making to- 
day advise that parallel with this framework there shall go 
outlines and descriptions of numerous large units of work of 
the problem-solving or project sort. This should be the real 
substance of the curriculum. Enough of these examples 
should be furnished so that the less creative and less compe- 
tent teachers may get many suggestions. They should be 
worked out in sufficient detail to show how the abstractions 
mentioned above are shot through with meaning when 
brought into relation with real experience and purposeful 
study. It will be a stultifying influence if these typical 
organized units come to be regarded as requirements to 
be carried out in any given school or grade according to 
form. 
Probably no one believes that the rank and file of our 
teaching corps is to-day prepared to inaugurate and conduct 
a thoroughgoing curriculum of children’s activities. And 
even if they were capable of this, few advocates of the 
method would claim that children can thus acquire all neces- 
sary knowledge and skill in all subjects during the limited 
school hours. 
To the extent that the children’s enterprises do not pro- 
vide the experience and practice necessary to establish cer- 
tain facts and skills believed to be essential to further pro- 
gress, the teacher can launch some suitable plan which will 
involve these elements. Or, by pointing out the lack and 
appealing directly to the intelligence and ambition of the 
children, she can secure their codperation in the necessary 
study or drill. The fact that we have in the past drawn too 
heavily on the latter kind of motive power should not blind 
us to the fact that children are often impelled to put forth 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  
86 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
effort because they obtain satisfaction from the exercise of 
native capacities and from the mastery of difficulties. 
In the matter of continuity we must remember also that 
the larger, richer experiences of school life offer progression 
as well as the more abstract types of subject-matter. For 
example, the same school sale for the benefit of some worthy 
object might yield practice in making change for second and 
third grades, training in setting correct prices for third and 
fourth, and experience in percentage and bookkeeping for 
more advanced pupils. The same festival might stimulate 
the kindergarten children to evolve a simple rhythmic move- 
ment expressive of some appropriate mood or idea, while the 
upper primary grades work out the historical background 
for a more formal dance or compose words and music for a 
song. It isnot uncommon to include the study of some food 
product (as milk or cereal) in the health program of a school 
for several successive years, new facts and new implications 
being considered each year according to the maturity and 
past experience of the pupils. 
As to knowing what is accomplished, schools in which a 
good part of the curriculum is of the type under discussion 
are not afraid of the standardized tests and scales which are 
used to measure more formal work. So far as these tests go, 
they will measure the product of the informal method also. 
But new modes are needed for estimating what is accom- 
plished by new methods of work, in esthetic appreciation, 
in improved standards of social behavior, and in habits 
essential to good citizenship.

KINDERGARTEN — Primary Farr 
Second Grade, Horace Mann School. Miss Mildred Batchelder, 
Teacher. Plan developed under the guidance of Miss Mabel 
Crumby and Miss Grace Parker, Graduate Students, Teachers 
College. 
For some time it has been the custom of the kindergarten and 
the first and second grades of the Horace Mann School to hold an 
annual fair for the benefit of the Manhattanville Day Nursery. 
‘The children are interested in the nursery because their parents are 
interested in it, and they, themselves, have contributed to it each 
year. 
Early in the spring the custom was recalled in the second grade, 
and also the fact that it was traditionally the part of this class to 
have a “tea-room” where lemonade and cookies were sold. 
This report is an outline of the steps in development and the 
more evident outcomes of this undertaking. 
1. Decision of the group to have a “tea-room” at the Annual Spring 
Fair, and to use the proceeds for the Day Nursery. 
2. Planning:

The committee feels that the project had real educational value 
in helping children to identify themselves with an important com- 
munity interest, in motivating the study of worth-while subject- 
matter, and also in developing desirable attitudes and habits. 
Among these are the steadiness necessary to organize and carry 
through an undertaking, codperation, unselfishness, neatness, and 
accuracy.

French Bazaar 
An activity which proved mutually helpful and purposeful! was a 
French Bazaar given by five first grades of Fairfax School, Cleve- 
land Heights, Ohio. 
Two war orphans — Marguerite and Etienne B., of Montrouge, 
France, had sent cards, letters, and even little home-made gifts to 
the children of Fairfax School as an expression of gratitude fora 
box sent at Christmas. 
The children of our school, wishing to contribute further to the 
support of Marguerite and Etienne — their “little French brother 
and sister”’ — planned and executed a sale or Bazaar. 
That this Bazaar might be a full and free expression of the group, 
many conferences were necessary and numerous and lengthy dis- 
cussions were held before the following were listed and approved: 
1. Articles to be made. 
2. Materials required. 
8. Money values.

. Kinds of labor. 
. Price lists. 
. Classifying and labeling. 
Arrangement of store. 
. Duties of salesmen. 
. Making change. 
. Attendants, clerks, ushers. SOMNAAAS 1 
The articles were made of clay, wood, fabrics, flower jars, ete. 
Each child was free to choose the article to be made and the 
material for it, but was required to keep to the list approved by the 
group. Each completed article was submitted to the group for 
approval. 
The advertising was an interesting feature. Pupils wrote 
notices to parents and friends; a bulletin was placed in Central 
Hall; a parade was made through upper-class rooms — large 
painted and framed placards announced kinds of articles for sale — 
American and French flags were carried and photographs of Mar- 
guerite and Etienne were displayed. 
The day itself was a memorable one. The morning was given 
over to arranging tables with tissue and crépe paper coverings; 
placing articles and price tags; assigning duties. The afternoon 
saw each child, in his “best bib and tucker,” take his place as at- 
tendant or usher, clerk or cashier, with a conflicting sense of dignity 
and hilarity. 
Almost every home was represented by a buyer. 
The results were most gratifying.

Grade IT A, Fairfax School. Miss Lela H. Durler, Teacher. 
A request came from the Principal to reduce, so far as possible, 
the number of children staying for lunch. The children were asked 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  ENTERPRISES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 93 
to time themselves as they went home to determine who were 
rightfully entitled to the privilege of staying for lunch. 
The next morning many disputes arose, owing to the fact that 
some hurried home, while others loitered. This brought forth the 
need of a “picture” to prove distances. A few attempts at such 
drawings were made to prove to the class that one child lived far- 
ther from school than another. The need of a map was expressed, 
and, as no large map could be found, one was drawn on the floor. 
In order to help the children get the sense of locality, churches, 
school, stores, and filling-stations in the district were located and 
marked with certain colored dots. Following this, each child came 
up to the map, traced his way from school to his home, and’ put his 
“home dot” of green on the proper side of the street and approxi- 
mately the correct distance from the street intersections. Finally 
a half-mile circle was drawn around the school dot to make the 
comparison of distances easier. 
On the sand table that afternoon several boys tried to settle an 
unfinished dispute about the locality of their homes by marking 
out streets and tracing their way home. 
From this came the suggestion that we make play streets to 
match the map. Several children brought tiny toy cardboard and 
wooden houses. A painted matchbox served for the schoolhouse. 
Cardboard streets were laid out that extended between Lee and: 
Taylor Roads and from Shaker Lakes to Meadowbrook Road. 
The size of the sand table was the only reason for such narrow 
boundaries. Several weeks were spent on this. 
Visitors’ Night gave an incentive for making a more finished 
product, and changed the spirit of play into active work. Details, 
such as sponge trees, flower-beds of tiny cut-outs, tiny people of 
pegs and crépe paper, park benches, boats on a glass lake, telephone 
poles, street signs, automobiles, fire plugs and fire engine, put on 
the finishing touches. The display was used not only for the 
entertainment of adult visitors, but other rooms were invited in to 
see it. On such occasions each child had an opportunity to ex- 
plain to some little visitor the work that interested him most. 
  Other results gained by the project: 
1. The need for, and use of a map. 
a. Understanding of directions as used on a map. 
b. The relative locations of places in the neighborhood. 
c. The comparing of distances.

This unit of work was the result of a study of Health, through 
which the children learned that milk is one of our most important 
foods. They raised so many questions about the source of the 
supply for New York, the different grades of milk, how it is kept 
pure, etc., that we decided to make a list of these questions in order 
to see which could be dealt with. The questions were written on 
a chart, and as the study progressed, new ones were added, and 
those which were satisfactorily answered were checked off. These 
are the questions which appeared when they were assembled for 
the first attack: 
. How do we know what milk contains? 
. What is meant by Grades A, B, C? 
. What is pasteurized milk? 
Where does our milk in New York City come from? 
. How is it shipped to New York? 
. Who brought dairy cows to this country? 
How much milk does a cow give a day? NO

(One shelf of the classroom library was reserved for books, magazines, 
advertising material, pictures, etc., which might be of help in this 
study. Both teacher and pupils contributed to this.) 
The children thought that question 2 should be taken up first, 
because it was probably important as regards health and because 
they were sure information could be readily obtained. Some of 
them knew of the Sheffield Farms Dairy Station, which is not far 
from the school, and a trip to this plant was planned. Here we 
learned about the New York City supply, shipment of milk, pas- 
teurization, grading of milk, measures taken for cleanliness, de- 
livery, etc. When we returned, the trip was discussed, and it was 
found that not only had we secured the answer to question 2, but 
that we had found answers to other questions also. 
We greatly wished to visit a dairy farm, but that was not pos- 
sible, so we turned to books, pictures, and lantern slides for in- 
formation. 
We wrote letters to the manager of the Sheffield plant thanking 
him for the help he had given us. 
We pasteurized raw milk at school by filling a test tube and 
heating it to 145°. This temperature was held for the time neces- 
sary for pasteurization. 
We made butter, cottage cheese, pressed cheese, junket, cocoa, 
and ice-cream at school. These activities grew out of our discus- 
sion of uses of milk in cooking, or how the food value of milk may 
be secured in a variety of ways. 
About this time another line of interest had culminated in the 
decision of the class to help in some way in the care of a particular 
baby at the day nursery near by. We chose a tiny boy named 
Jimmie who needed at the time a good supply of milk. Money 
would be required, and the “Ways and Means” Committee de- 
cided on a sale of cookies in the hall of the school. The codperation 
of the Domestic Science teacher was secured, and by working in 
relays a quantity of cookies of a very salable kind were produced. 
This was so timed that che children were able to use in their cookies 
the butter which they had already churned. We advertised the 
sale by means of speeches made in different classrooms and by 
posters placed in conspicuous places in the halls. We made about

nine dollars from this sale and the proceeds were used to furnish 
Jimmie’s milk over a considerable period. 
A group representing the class visited the day nursery and be- 
came acquainted with ‘“‘our baby.” (See Fig. 11.) There were a 
number of situations in this connection which called for oral and 
written English.

The arithmetic for a period of several weeks was greatly enriched 
in meaning by the calculations really needed to carry on the under- 
takings and by those which helped to interpret certain facts. As 
almost always happens in any genuine situation involving number, 
problems arose calling for facts and skills not at the command of 
the third-grade children. The teacher then decided upon one of 
several courses: 
To perform the operation herself until certain results were ob- 
tained which pupils could again deal with. 
To submit the problem to a higher grade for solution, the results 
to be reported back to the third grade. 
If the operation were only a little beyond the children’s power, 
postpone until suitable drill could be given.

The Sheffield Farms Company loaned us a moving-picture film 
whith told the story of milk. This picture inspired the children 
to make a “movie” of their own. Only by a considerable stretch 
of imagination would a matter-of-fact grown-up conceive of the 
result as a moving picture, as it was more like the old-fashioned 
panorama. (Fig. 12 shows a picture of the “‘film.’”’) It consisted

of a scroll made from a yellow window shade torn into three 
lengths or “reels” each a yard long and twelve inches wide. These 
were later pasted together giving a total length of nine feet. A 
committee of children selected by vote had charge of the work. 
They called upon others for plans, drawings, paintings, cut-out 
pictures, written explanations, etc. These were pasted on the 
scroll in a sequence which would give a complete record of the 
work done. The “film” was called “Milk from the Farm to Us.” 
Then the mothers were invited to see it. As each section was 
unrolled by the ‘“‘operators”’ in charge, a speech of explanation was 
made by children who had chosen certain parts upon which to 
talk.

The speeches given in connection with the picture shown in 
Fig. 12 were as follows: 
“This is the wagon that brings us our milk very early in the 
morning. It leaves the Pasteurizing Plant about five o’clock in the 
morning. People work all night so that we may have milk for 
breakfast.” : 
“This is the way the milk looks when it is left at our homes. It 
has a cap fitted very tightly over the bottle so that no dirt can get 
into the milk.” 
Other pictures were explained by such remarks as: 
“This is a picture of a little baby. How fat she is — because I 
think she drinks cow’s milk.” 
“This is the way a healthy baby looks. This is my little 
brother.” 
“This shows the churn we used. We got a big lump of butter. 
Then we drank the butter-milk. We made cookies with the butter 
that was left.” 
“After we had our cookie sale, we got about nine dollars, and this 
money was sent down to the day nursery to a boy named Jimmie, 
so that Jimmie might get milk. Next year when we are in fourth 
grade we think we will help him too.” 
TRANSFORMING A PorTABLE BuILDING 
Fort Wayne Normal Training School, Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
Miss Rena Allen, Teacher. 
We had a portable school building which no one liked. Parents 
and teachers together discussed the matter, and it was quite 
generally agreed that such a room was unpleasant, uncomfortable, 
and inconvenient. The teachers did not want to teach there and 
parents did not want their children to study there. However, 
there was neither time nor money to build a permanent addition 
to the main building and we must have more room. 
As I walked through this much-discussed portable with its long 
row of small windows, its unsightly jacketed furnace, its forty 
nailed-down seats occupying most of the available space, and its 
generally unfinished appearance, I did not blame either parents, 
teachers, or children very much for their desire to avoid such a 
place, but I wondered if something could be done to render it 
more acceptable. Finally I agreed to take a group of forty 
Three “‘A”’—Four “B” children and see what we could make of it.
-P-A-G-E-111
ENTERPRISES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 99 
The first day of school I faced a disappointed group of children. 
I sat down with them and said, ““Do you know why I chose this 
room?” There was a chorus of “no’s.” *“‘ Well,” I said, “I chose 
it because it was ugly, and I thought perhaps we could make it 
better.” 
The suggestions that came first were too ambitious, as we had 
practically no money to spend; but finally one little girl said, “Per- 
heps curtains would help some.” After that, other good ideas 
came in rapid succession. A screen to hide the stove — pictures 
on the wall — a flower-box full of flowers — a bookcase, etc. 
We decided to keep our plans as secret as possible, and at the 
end of six weeks invite our friends to judge the result. 
The girls made Dutch curtains of cheesecloth — two strips at 
each end of the long row of windows, and a ruffle across the’ top. 
We were careful not to shut out too much light. These curtains 
we stenciled by using the end of a spool on an ink-pad. 
The boys made window-boxes, a bookcase, and a screen to hide 
the stove. 
The seats troubled us not a little until one of the boys suggested 
moving them over, pushing two rows together and having the extra 
aisle space at one side. The girls then suggested weaving small 
rugs to use if we wished to sit on the floor. (We were fond of 
doing informal group work, and we had no little chairs.) 
‘We made looms from boxes, and the children brought rags from 
home which they cut and sewed in school and wove into a “‘hit-and- 
miss pattern.” We finally sewed these small rugs together and 
made one large one. 
We had an old library table. The girls stenciled a runner to 
match the curtains, and some one contributed a bowl of goldfish 
and a lovely green bow] for flowers. 
We arranged our room in three sections. The library corner for 
study and recreation, the fixed seats for individual study work, and 
the “business corner” for group work. The children were enthu- 
siastic. They came early and stayed late so that our regular work 
was not interfered with. 
The last day of preparation came. Before we left that night, we 
put the room in order. The rug was on the floor, the bookcase was 
filled with books. On the library table were the runner, fish globe, 
and books. Small rockers contributed by the children were so 
arranged as to give an added air of informal comfort. 
The business corner had its small chairs (secured by the Principal

after seeing our efforts) arranged in a convenient group by the 
blackboard. 
The window-boxes were filled with the fern-like green of carrot 
tops, for, as one little boy remarked, “If they freeze we can always 
get another carrot.” The bowl at the rear window was filled with 
bright-colored zinnias. 
The screen covered with burlap concealed the ugly stove and at 
the same time served as a bulletin board. 
With the soft curtains at the windows the whole effect was most 
“homey,” attractive, and comfortable. 
Next morning I found the children standing in rather awed 
groups, strangely silent and just gazing at their transformed room. 
It was their plan carried out, and they were evidently impressed. 
One little girl standing near slipped her hand into mine and said, 
with a queer little catch in her voice — “‘ Miss Allen, I never had a 
room that I liked like this.” Iam sure the rest of us felt the same 
way. 
The parents who came in response to our invitation were de- 
lighted, and so far as I knew there were no more complaints 
regarding the use of this portable building. 
Puppet SHows 1n Fourtu Grape 
Horace Mann School, Miss Ethel M. Orr, Teacher. 
Our children have had numerous opportunities to see good pup- 
pet shows, and one boy in the fourth grade conceived the idea of 
making a small one himself. He started it at home and brought it 
to school in an unfinished state. The play was original and was 
called Life in Japan. An attempt was made to represent the 
people, customs, and scenery of Japan and to have a little dramatic 
action, but this first play never passed beyond a very crude stage. 
As always happens when any especially fascinating enterprise is 
launched, several children soon took up the idea and began to de- 
velop it in their own individual way. Before the year was over, at 
least ten different puppet shows were brought to completion under 
as many different leaders. In general form they were much alike. 
A soapbox or other medium-size wooden box was secured. The 
open side became the front: of the theater, and the larger part of 
what was then the top was removed in order to permit the puppet- 
eers to operate the figures by manipulating strings or fine wires 
from above.
-P-A-G-E-113
  
  ENTERPRISES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 101 
Numerous problems arose which called for patient experiment 
and sustained thinking. What kind of figures to use and how to 
operate them, were pressing questions. After numerous experi- 
ments most of the children settled on small celluloid dolls. Some 
of these were jointed and some were not. ‘There was no attempt 
at a network of strings by which to secure gesture. The figures 
were suspended from the back of the head, and action was always 
very simple, crude, and stiff. 
Various schemes were tried for weighting the dolls so their feet 
would glide along the floor. Sometimes lead weights such as 
tailors use were attached to the clothes. The method which 
proved to be most effective and most easily accomplished was to 
slit the hollow celluloid dolls and drop in enough small shot to give 
stability. 
The children soon turned their attention to devising ways and 
means to shut off the view of the puppeteers from the audience and 
to get the figures on and off the stage in a more adroit fashion. 
G. E., who was one of the first to develop a play, worked at home 
more or less and had considerable assistance from his father. To- 
gether they produced a charming little stage with real wings well 
placed for exit and entrance of puppets. G. E.’s play was Cin- 
derella, and he had particularly artistic scenes and effective stage 
properties. Other children solved the problem by placing small 
screens about the stage in such way as to conceal to some extent 
the manipulation of the figures. All admired G. E.’s stage, but 
were quite happy with their own after they had done their best. 
The matter of a curtain proved to be more or less troublesome. 
Some made cloth curtains with rings intended to slide on a wire, 
but they proved to be rather clumsy for such a small stage. A 
window-shade to roll up and down was adopted by some and a 
piece of cardboard to drop down was the simple expedient of others. 
No small difficulty was presented in the matter of preparing 
suitable costumes for the small dolls. Both boys and girls worked 
quite independently and the boys proved to be more clever than 
the girls at the task. They evidently conceived of themselves as 
theatrical costumers and producers, and there was no suggestion 
that they were sewing doll clothes. 
Two of the boys conceived the idea of having electric footlights 
and side-lights. A special science teacher, who was already doing 
some work with this class, was consulted, and together he and the 
boys evolved a scheme for attaching tiny bulbs. The whole class
-P-A-G-E-114

shared in this simple lesson in electrical attachment and partici- 
pated in the discussion aroused. 
Pictures of two of these little theaters are shown in Figs. 13 
and 14. 
With two exceptions all the plays represented scenes from such 
familiar stories as Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Snow White and 
Rose Red, Red Riding Hood, King Alfred and the Cakes, and Tom

Sawyer. M. H. was, in a way, more ambitious, and undertook to 
write an entirely original play as well as to produce it. He called 
his play Life in New York, and the dialogue proved to be exceed- 
ingly entertaining to children. It also furnished much amusement 
to the grown-ups who saw it. This boy found at the five-and-ten- 
cent store a small doll with only one leg. He seized upon this 
damaged toy and cast it for the part of Crippled Johnnie, who de- 
veloped into a very important and lively character in the realistic 
play about New York apartment-house life. 
The originators and owners of these puppet theaters drew other 
children into their schemes in various ways until practically all the 
class were participating to some extent. They assisted in com- 
posing the dialogue and criticized the plays at various stages. At 
intervals larger groups worked under the direction of the teacher 
upon the English involved in the enterprises. ‘Two or three chil- 
dren were called in to serve as puppeteers for each play. They had 
to manipulate the figures and speak the appropriate lines “in 
character.” This called for preparation on the part of a number 
of children, frequent try-outs and good team-work. When these 
little plays were given for the entertainment of other classes, re- 
sponsibility was thrown on different children to extend invitations, 
look after seating, and make explanatory speeches. 
The final culmination, and one not anticipated in the beginning, 
was the offering of four of these puppet shows as the fourth-grade 
contribution to the annual Spring Fair for the benefit of the Man- 
hattanville Day Nursery, and other child-welfare work. The fair 
took place after school hours, and a room was set aside for the little 
theaters. Remarkable organizing ability was demonstrated by the 
children. They formed themselves into committees and made 
themselves responsible for certain duties. The plays were adver- 
tised in distinctive ways by posters, sandwich men, and oral an- 
nouncements. A real program was worked out consisting of short 
speeches serving to introduce the different plays, and selections to 
be played on the Victrola during the time required to set up the 
different theaters and get the puppeteers in place. An admission 
of five cents was charged, tickets were made and sold at the door, 
and accounts were carefully audited. A gratifying amount was 
realized for the support of the child-welfare work.   Outcomes

and of the social group. Also the actual test of such ability. 
3. First-rate thinking in the face of numerous smaller or larger

art of a specific kind. 
8. Some excellent experience in arithmetic appropriate to the 
grade. 
9. Satisfaction of the group in realization that they had pro- 
duced something of genuine worth in an important commu- 
nity affair. 
The following reports tell their own story. They are not 
written up as organized project work, as were the preceding 
records, but reproduce oral accounts given by children fol- 
lowing upon some of their excursions or other interesting 
experiences. 
The teacher wrote the children’s statements on the black- 
board, and later had the complete “stories” multigraphed 
so that each child had a record of outstanding activities and 
events of the year in a form which he could read. 
These reports are from the second grade, State Normal 
School, San José, California; teacher, Miss Martha Porter. 
The present writer has the full report of social studies, en- 
vironmental life, and nature study as developed by Miss 
Porter during the fall of 1922. It is easy to read between 
the lines and see how rich is this curriculum in fruitful ac- 
tivity which engenders a great variety of related activities 
of a valuable kind.

How Eggs Hatch 
Our hen came the fourteenth of April 
and the eggs are going to hatch 
the fifth of May. 
The hen keeps the eggs warm 
and turns them over once a day. 
She does that to keep the chick 
from sticking to the shell. 
At the end of three weeks 
the chick pecks its way 
out of the shell. 
How Chickens Hatch Without Their Mothers 
We went on the Willow car to the Santa Clara Valley Hatchery. 
We saw incubators. The incubator was big, with doors. When 
you open the doors you can see eggs. One incubator held twelve 
thousand eggs. They turn a crank to turn the eggs over so the 
little chicks will not stick to the shell. ‘There was a gas heater to 
heat water pipes and a fan to send the heat through the incubator. 
We saw a chicken’s bill peeping out of the shell. A little chicken 
was pulling and pulling, trying to get out of its shell. There were 
some boxes with little holes in, to ship the chickens away. In the 
morning the chickens are not strong enough to stand on their feet. 
In the afternoon they are. They have brooders to keep the chicks 
until they sell them. 
The writers of these reports have in most cases pointed 
out some of the principal direct and indirect values or out- 
comes of the several projects described. In addition we 
should note certain points of worth found to some degree 
in all of these enterprises. 
1. They exhibit an expanding field of interest and offer a 
range of experience much broader than that of the conven- 
tional primary school. 
The occasion of the French Bazaar for example takes the 
children across the ocean to enter into the lives and needs of 
other children. In order to carry out their plans they must 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
108 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
also reach out into their own neighborhood and draw parents 
and adult friends into a common undertaking. 
Similarly the Spring Sale brings the school into contact 
with an important community institution, the Day Nursery. 
In order to fulfill the obligation entered into, almost all the 
knowledge and skill which the second-grade pupils possess 
or are capable of acquiring in a limited time is called upon. 
The Milk Study goes far beyond the ordinary features of 
the health program and carries the children into a genuine 
social study of one of the most important industries in 
modern life. It embraces not only the interests and needs of 
the children concerned but the welfare of other children as 
well. 
In the reconstructed and beautified portable building the 
children took over for solution a problem which was really 
the concern of the school and the community. In so doing 
they were getting fine training for a high type of home- 
making and a larger citizenship. 
2. The projects described give added meaning and im- 
portance to much of the more routine work of the school. 
The practical demands of these enterprises also serve as im- 
pressive tests of achievement. These seven reports taken 
together furnish examples of superior work in oral and writ- 
ten English,- arithmetic, fine arts, industrial art, hygiene, 
literature, and civics. They also show possibilities in the 
direction of geography and nature study. 
3. The opportunities are great for training in habits and 
attitude that are of the utmost importance in the immediate 
and future lives of the children. The ability to carry re- 
sponsibility, to think clearly, to study effectively; the ability 
to see things from a less individualistic point of view; growth 
in true leadership; habits of perseverance; acceptable social 
habits which develop only when children have a chance to 
mingle naturally in a real social group including older people;  
-P-A-G-E-121

     — all of these we see exhibited to some extent in the above 
reports. We know, too, that these values cannot be secured 
in a school in which only bookish and scholastic exercises are 
provided.

. Most of these undertakings branched out considerably from 
the original propositions. Examine them to see if the de- 
velopment seems forced. 
. Which of these enterprises seem best suited to the average

. Is it advisable to attempt to copy such projects? Why? 
. Pick out several features which you consider valuable in the 
work described and point out the special merits. Which fea- 
tures do you consider of doubtful value? 
3. Point out particularly good opportunities in the activities 
described, for training in good citizenship.

  CHAPTER Vi 
WHAT CONSTITUTES A SOCIALIZED RECITATION ? 
Tuer has been a good deal of discussion in recent years re- 
garding a form of recitation which has been designated as 
socialized. The two terms social and recitation, with the 
meanings which they ordinarily connote, do not seem to link 
up very well. It is necessary to get a conception of a recita- 
tion which bears very little relation to the root of the word 
recite before we can conceive of the implied activity as being 
at all social in its nature. To recite is to state or tell again, 
and in the old type of recitation the telling again was always 
at the instance of the teacher and before an audience sup- 
posed to know all of the facts just as well as the reciter. The 
telling again was usually for the purpose of testing or fixing 
the knowledge of the one reciting; or, in its better form, for 
the purpose of clarifying the facts under consideration and 
pointing the way to obtaining more facts. The teacher ini- 
tiated, directed, controlled the whole movement, asked all 
the questions, passed judgment on all replies, and dictated 
what was to follow. This type of recitation was social only 
in the sense that it faithfully represented a certain notion of 
school society. The new type likewise can be genuine only 
to the extent that it reflects a fundamentally different school 
society. The recitation is only one small part of the daily 
life and experience of the classroom community and it re- 
veals the underlying social theory which controls the school. 
If a vigilant, autocratic discipline is the general rule, at- 
tempting to relax it during certain periods or to dispense 
with it temporarily will not succeed. The result will be a 
warring of contrary tendencies and the consequent failure to 
establish habits and ideals generally applicable beyond the  
-P-A-G-E-123
    
A SOCIALIZED RECITATION 11 
limits of the particular recitation. It is like trying to reduce 
a symptom without going to the root of the disease, and 
the results will be equally unsatisfactory. Such superficial 
doctoring often produces a class exercise wearing a mask of 
freedom which is at heart the same old stereotyped, un- 
liberal thing; or, worse still, what was good in the old is lost 
and there is substituted a weak, ineffectual, and poorly or- 
ganized group effort. 
Through numerous published articles as well as from ob- 
servation we have grown familiar of late with some of these 
spurious forms of the so-called socialized recitation. The 
child critic and questioner is prominent, and the pupils al- 
ways address each other by name and strew their remarks 
with “Excuse me”; “I beg your pardon”; “ Will you be so 
kind, John”; and, “Thank you, Miss Jones.” Pointless 
questions and inane remarks get by under the dazzling cloak 
of drawing-room manners, and robust discussion and criti- 
cism languish when the major emphasis is placed upon mere 
activity and social forms. Common courtesy should be in- 
culcated and should finally prevail in the room, but con- 
ventionally polite phrases, the attempt to substitute a child 
for the teacher, and talk merely for the sake of talking, do 
not constitute a genuine social activity. 
The following is an example of this sort of pseudo-social 
lesson: 
The teacher announced a reading lesson and pupils took 
copies of Alice in Wonderland from their desks. One child 
(Mary) who had evidently been appointed at a previous 
lesson, rose and faced the class. 
Mary. Where did we leave off in Alice yesterday, Tom? 
Tom. We left off where the Caucus race was run and the mouse 
told its long tale to Alice and the other creatures. What chapter 
was that, Daniel? 
Daniel. We finished Chapter III yesterday.
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Mary. Daniel, will you please begin? 
Daniel. (Announces Chapter IV, page 35, and reads.) 
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again and looking 
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she 
heard it muttering to itself, “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, 
my dear paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers. She'll get me executed, 
as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I 
wonder?” Alice guessed ina moment that it was looking for the 
fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly 
began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen — 
everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and 
the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished 
completely. 
By the time Daniel had reached this point three other 
children had risen and one of them (Ruth) said: 
“Excuse me, Daniel, but you did not pronounce whiskers exactly 
right. Please say whip.” (Daniel tries.) “‘ Now will you say why, 
whistle, whisper.” (Daniel again makes an effort and apparently 
satisfies Ruth, who ceases to drill. But he is not to be excused yet, 
for James takes up the attack.) 
James. Daniel, what does executed mean? 
Daniel. To be killed. 
Grace. Daniel, did you notice that can is printed in italics? Will 
you please read that sentence again? 
Daniel reads again, ““Where can I have dropped them, 
etc.,” and emphasizes can, to the satisfaction of Grace. 
As no further comments are made, Daniel, evidently glad 
to be relieved, calls on Arthur. 
Arthur rises and reads: 
Very soon the rabbit noticed Alice as she went hunting about, 
and called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what are 
you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch a pair of 
gloves and a fan! Quick, now!” and Alice was so much frightened 
that she ran off at once in the direction pointed to, without trying 
to explain the mistake it had made. 
John is now on his feet and as Arthur pauses he questions 
him:
-P-A-G-E-125
  A SOCIALIZED RECITATION 113 
John. Arthur, can you use another word in place of fetch, where 
the rabbit says, “fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan’”’? 
Arthur. Yes, John, I could say, “bring me a pair of gloves and a 
fan.”’ Louise, will you please read? 
Louise: 
“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. 
“How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’'d 
better take him his fan and gloves — that is, if I can find them.” 
As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of 
which was a bright brass plate with the name “W. RABBIT” en- 
graved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried up- 
stairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be 
turned out of the house before she (had) found the fan and gloves. 
Morris. Louise, will you look at that last sentence again. You 
left out the word had. 
Louise. Did I? Vl read it again. (Reads again, putting in all 
the words.) 
And so the lesson continues reaching that deliciously 
funny scene where the White Rabbit and Pat and poor Bill 
the Lizard attempt to eject Alice from the tiny house. But 
not a question was asked or a remark made which tended to 
bring out more fully points essential to a keener appreciation 
of the absurd situation, and there was no hearty general 
laughter at any time during the lesson. No one asked lead- 
ing, pointed questions calculated to set the others thinking 
about Alice’s relative size at this juncture, what caused her 
to change in size the last time, why she was in such awe of 
the rabbit, and what W stood for on the door-plate. 
In such a lesson the mantle of an exacting teacher has 
fallen upon the children, and with the same fussiness they 
take up her supposed obligation to point out with meticulous 
care all the petty faults and minor errors which occur. 
About the only difference is that the polite nagging is dis- 
tributed among a larger number of people instead of being 
exercised by one. There is nothing genuinely social about 
this lesson except the delightful story itself with its universal
-P-A-G-E-126

appeal. But the fine flavor and deep enjoyment of a great 
literary treasure are sacrificed to a false conception of what _ 
constitutes a democratic organization of the group. 
What are some of the essential elements in a truly social- 
ized recitation? 
One of the first requirements is that {the subject-matter 
itself shall have real social worth to the pupils. Poor con-’ 
tent, outworn theory, or ideas and facts so remote from child 
life that the participants cannot link them up with experi- 
ence can be of no social value to those concerned no matter 
in what form the exercise is cast. What matter, in a reading 
lesson, whether child or teacher occupy the leader’s chair, or 
how many pupils volunteer, if the matter is not worth read- 
ing? And what is gained by a pupil-directed nature-study 
lesson if it deal only with isolated facts detached from sig- 
nificant experience? An arithmetic lesson involving ex- 
amples in which eggs are said to sell at fifteen cents a dozen, 
butter at twenty cents a pound, and milk at five cents a 
quart, cannot be socialized by any particular mode of con- 
ducting it. The statements themselves are false in present- 
day life, and are therefore fundamentally non-social. Or 
take the following authentic occurrences: In a school in a re- 
mote district where the people were very poor, a class in 
hygiene was reciting. The children had memorized the 
statement from their textbook that in sweeping a room wet 
tea-leaves should be sprinkled over the floor. The visitor 
knew that in the homes represented tea rarely ever found its 
way. From the same text another day these pupils quoted 
the statement that, in case of sudden illness in the family, 
some one should run to the nearest telephone and call a 
physician and not attempt home treatment. The nearest 
telephone was probably fifteen miles distant. The stand- 
ards of living were very low in the homes of these children, 
and there was dire need for instruction in hygiene which 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
A SOCIALIZED RECITATION 115 
would fit, but the material in use was false to the life of the 
community, and, unmodified, would defeat any attempt at 
‘socialization of the recitation, although encouragement of a 
genuine questioning attitude on the part of the pupils cer- 
tainly would have caused some child to challenge the state- 
ments quoted. 
As suggested in the beginning of this chapter, the social- 
ized recitation depends upon a more truly democratic or- 
ganization of the class even with children of primary-school 
age. This calls for the establishment of natural, simple, 
human relations and contacts between the members of the 
group including children, teacher, supervisor, and principal. 
The teacher who stands in fear of the displeasure of her su- 
pervisor if she depart in the slightest degree from a pre- 
scribed procedure will find it impossible to accord anything 
but a travesty of freedom to her pupils. Cooley ! calls de- 
mocratic control “the organized sway of public opinion,” 
and it is through this gradual building-up of public opinion 
that children arrive at a higher regard for the rights of others 
and due respect for properly constituted authority. They 
come to understand that freedom means not liberty to do 
anything that one pleases, but an enlarged opportunity to 
please to do, or to choose, from among those things which 
public opinion says are right and desirable. Cooley ? also 
says, “Freedom can be increased only in connection with in- 
crease of sympathy, intelligence, and self-control in indi- 
viduals,”’ and it is the place of the adults in the school com- 
munity to call these powers into exercise among the children 
as much as possible, keeping firm control at all times and 
places where their “instructed conscience” is not equal to 
the demand. The socialized recitation from this viewpoint 
involves the highest type of mental and moral discipline and

can succeed only in an atmosphere of mutual confidence and 
active good-will. 
So far as pupils are able, they should carry responsibility 
for contributing materials, ideas, and questions, and for 
making judgments and assignments, and this responsibility 
must be real, not make-believe. If an individual or a com- 
mittee undertake a certain part, the contractor or contrac- 
tors will be expected to put the thing through without inter- 
ference and without undue intervention from teacher or 
classmates. A sturdy independence in individual effort, 
coupled with a willingness to submit to direction and criti- 
cism from others when such are needed, will be the ideal 
toward which to work. 
The more superficial features, such as arrangement of 
furniture and consequent physical relations of the group, 
while of minor importance, have a direct bearing upon any 
attempt at a more sociable type of class-work. The raised 
platform for the teacher’s desk has almost disappeared, but 
straight rows of desks for pupils all facing that of the teacher 
still prevail. This arrangement implies a super-authority 
with the reins of control always in hand and one to whom all 
remarks and inquiries must be addressed. Some college 
professors refuse to conduct a course in a classroom having 
approximately this arrangement. They say they can get no 
free discussion in such a room, and insist upon having stu- 
dents seated around tables arranged in a hollow square. 
When this arrangement is obtained, students are never ex- 
pected to rise when they speak unless they have something 
to demonstrate, and any other order would be thought 
stilted and unnatural. For little children it would seem that 
the least we might ask would be half as many small chairs as 
there are pupils in the class, these chairs to be taken at times 
to any open space in the room in order to furnish a grouping 
more conducive to free intercourse. 
ne
-P-A-G-E-129
A SOCIALIZED RECITATION 117 
As to other minor features, such as rising to speak, raising 
the hands, addressing each other by name, ete., when the 
teacher comes down off her elevated platform mentally and 
spiritually as she has already done physically, it will be seen 
that any procedure which is proper and efficient in a large 
family or a small club is all right for a schoolroom, and that 
no uniform rule can fit all occasions. The idea that there is 
a certain kind of schoolroom order which should be different 
from that of all other assembled groups has had a vicious 
effect. As to the formalities, the manifestations of sincere 
courtesy and ordinary politeness called for in healthy, re- 
fined family life will be the standard, and intercourse will be 
free from stilted and artificial formule. 
The socialized recitation demands, of course, a common 
aim and a specific purpose. Cooley defines society as “an 
organized body held together by common aims and pur- 
poses.” If this is true of a great social body, it is equally 
true of small groups of children. Outside of strict control 
through adult authority there is nothing that holds children 
together and causes them to exert something of a united effort 
except a cleat aim and strong purpose of their own, or one 
which they understand and to which they can respond with 
genuine interest. It follows that the multiplication of such 
purposes in the school life of young children will hasten their 
development in readiness and ability to do good.team-work. 
And, as a final test, there should from time to time appear 
eas a result of such recitations some clear-cut social outcome 
extending beydnd the classroom. Reading in assembly as a 
climax to delightful reading hours together; connections set 
up with the public library; a-table in the hall containing con- 
tinuous display of wild flowers cared for and replenished by a 
particular class as thé culmination of their nature-study 
work for a seasgn; a number-game made by the children in 
one class for a lower grade as token of their own mastery of

rands for parents and verify change up to a certain amount. 
The following record is offered as an example of a class 
exercise which seems to exemplify to a high degree the char- 
acteristics discussed above: 
1. The subject-matter has real worth to the pupils. 
2. The relation of teacher and pupils and of pupils to each other 
is natural, simple, and wholesomely stimulating.

the success of the undertaking.

informality of address are conducive to a social feeling. |

prolonged worth to the group.

Fourth Grade. Horace Mann School. Miss Bess M. Young, Teacher. 
Pupils in this class always accomplish a large amount of 
independent. reading. They have a Book Club with the 
simplest possible organization and the meetings are almost 
entirely managed by the children. All pupils (with a little 
well-directed effort) may qualify for membership and at the 
time the meeting here described took place all members of 
the class were also members of the club. 
The only officer is a president or chairman whose term of 
office ranges from one to four weeks. There is a class libra- 
rian, but he is not a club officer. The librarian is expected 
to appoint committees from time to time to perform certain 
duties. The president is elected by the simple process of 
nominations from the floor to the number of three, followed 
by a rising vote on these names taken in their order. The 
one having the largest number of votes is elected. The 
qualifications of a good chairman have often been discussed, 
and most of the children are anxious to demonstrate these 
qualities in order to serve at some time during the year.

The teacher’s purposes in encouraging the club are: 
. To stimulate extensive réading of a variety of good books. 
. To aid in developing a discriminating taste. 
. To stimulate the weaker children to work hard on other read- 
ing exercises in order to be eligible for membership. 
4. To provide a very vital situation calling for ‘a certain amount 
of audience reading. 
5. To provide occasions for good organization of “speeches” and

The children’s main satisfactions seem to be found: 
1. In the pleasure derived from a club organization with its at- 
tendant business. 
2.’ In getting practical suggestions for selection of books for their 
personal libraries. 
8. In the opportunity to borrow books.

» The writer attended a club meeting in February, 1924, at 
which time the children were endeavoring to “take stock” 
as to what they had read the first half-year. They reported 
books read, gave some estimate of favorite books, recom- 
mended certain ones to the entire class and others to par- 
ticular classmates, and engaged to pick out five books which 
they felt every child in the class should read during the year. 
The children took their places at the front of the room 
occupying chairs arranged in a close circle. The teacher sat 
with the children and the president stood most of the time. 
George F. (the president, addressing the librarian): “Jimmie, do 
you want to say anything about the library?” 
Jimmie: “Yes, I think some people are careless about putting 
labels back on when they come off. And maybe we could find a 
better way to make out our slips.” 
George F.: “I want to suggest that when a label comes off a book, 
you take a little paste or glue and stick it back on. It will make a 
lot of trouble if you don’t.”

120 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Several children began to talk at once and the chairman 
called them to order. He then recognized Dick and gave 
him the floor. 
Dick: “Don’t you think it would be a good idea to write the 
numbers inside the books?” 
(This proposition was discussed; there was a difference of 
opinion; Miss Young spoke of the advantages of the plan; a 
boy called “Question”; and it was voted by a showing of 
hands to put numbers inside books, in pencil.) 
Audrey: “Id like to know if we are going to have committees 
appointed.” 
Miss Young: “Jack will attend to that matter later.” 
George F.: “In order to make a choice list, we must know which 
books you have read you like the very best. If you recommend a 
book for everybody to read, Miss Young is going to write the name 
of it on the blackboard. Who is ready to report? — Nat.” 
Nat: “The best book I’ve read lately is by Leander Keyser. It’s 
called Our Bird Comrades. He told how to tell the birds by their 
color and shape. He told not only about birds’ habits, but about 
his own interesting experiences with birds.” 
Miss Young: “Would that book be interesting to every one in 
the class?” 
Nat: “To those that are fond of nature, it would.” 
Billy: “T’ve just finished The Quest of the Golden Fleece, by Pa- 
draic Colum. Among the other stories is a fine one which I espe- 
cially liked about how Theseus killed the Minotaur. Any one that 
likes Greek stories will like this book, I’m sure.” 
George F.: “Billy, do you recommend that book for the whole 
class?” 
Billy: “Yes, I do.” 
(Miss Young wrote title on blackboard.) 
Boykie: “T’ve been reading a book of Greek stories too. It’s 
Kingsley’s Greek Heroes — all about Perseus and the Argonauts, 
and Theseus. I think it’s fine and I recommend it to every one 
who likes exciting stories. I know the boys will enjoy it.” 
(Miss Young added this title.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-133

Audrey: “A book that I like very much is Scudder’s Book of 
Legends. I chose it because it has a number of short stories and I 
wanted to find something good to read out loud. I think Jimmie 
and John and Dick would like it.” 
George F.: “Is any one else ready to report? — Eleanor.” 
Eleanor: “I enjoyed Sarah Crewe more than any other book I’ve 
read this year.” 
(Eleanor gave a brief account of certain incidents she 
especially liked.) 
Miss Young: “Some other people have been reading Sarah Crewe. 
Perhaps they might like to say something about it.” 
(The chairman then called on Jaqueline, who added other 
interesting points.) 
Jimmie: “The book I like best of all is Pyle’s King Arthur. I 
think everybody would like it. It’s about kings and knights and 
ladies in old England. Some of the class might not be able to read 
it this year. It isn’t easy reading.” 
Dick: ““When did the author live? I mean is he living now?” 
A short discussion followed about new versions or new 
editions of old tales. Miss Young joined in this and the 
children mentioned several examples, such as Robinson 
Crusoe (Baldwin edition) and various editions of Robin 
Hood. 
Jaqueline: “I want to recommend Robin Hood. I think every 
one would like it, especially any one who likes stories of long ago.” 
Eleanor: “When I was out of school I read Little Lord Fauntleroy. 
That is, I read part of it and my mother read part of it to me. I 
didn’t like the grandfather very much because he didn’t treat 
Cedric and his mother very well, but in the end he wasn’t so bad.” 
George N.: “There is something else interesting about Lord 
Fauntleroy; that is, his visits to Mr. Hobbs and their amusing talk.” 
Jack: “One of the most entertaining books I ever read is Dr. 
Dolittle’s Post-Office. I like his imaginary words, and it’s so excit- 
ing all the time to see what is going to happen.” 
George F.: “That place in Dr. Dolittle about trying to shave with-

out any water is funny. The mice run around trying to bring 
water in nutshells. There are a lot of other amusing things, too.” 
Miss Young (to the president): “You have just three minutes 
left.” 
Alice: “I move we vote for the next president.” 
George F.: “Are there any nominations?” 
A new president (Boykie) was duly elected, and he then 
proceeded to name a committee of four who were to make 
special preparation for a short oral reading period the next 
week. 
Miss Young: “May I make a suggestion? Shall we try now to 
make a list of five books which we think every person in the class 
should read before the end of the year? Let us take that as a ques- 
tion to report on Monday.”

Later in the term these children will be asked to judge 
again which of all the books they have read during the year 
should be marked (double-starred) as the finest and best for 
the fourth grade in their own school. Their judgments and 
those of teachers and specialists will form the basis for select-

in Wonderland could be made a truly social experience. 
2. Point out some desirable social features in the second exercise

  CHAPTER VII 
COMMAND OF ORAL ENGLISH REQUIRES ITS ABUNDANT 
USE AS A SOCIAL INSTRUMENT 
Tere is no subject in the curriculum more obviously social 
in intent and in possible content than the study of the 
mother tongue or the tongue of one’s adopted country. The 
uses of reading, writing, and arithmetic are more delayed in 
the lives of children, and therefore are not so apparent. In 
consequence, much skill is required on the part of teachers to 
launch these subjects successfully and secure effective im- 
petus for their pursuit; whereas most children, far from being 
beginners, are already quite advanced in speech control even 
when they start to kindergarten, since they have been mak- 
ing free and successful use of the art for some years. In- 
fluences offering strong impetus and direction to the further 
development and refinement of this art lie close at hand and 
teachers must go out of their way to avoid or nullify them. 
Children have had an enormous amount of practice in the 
art of language during the pre-school period, beginning in 
the cradle with cooing and babbling — the instinctive vocal 
play of infancy. They have benefited by much unconscious 
teaching, and perhaps most of those born of native parents 
have had some more or less direct help in the uses and forms 
of English speech as applied to everyday life. 
How pvors Laneuace Power Grow IN THE PRE-ScHOOL 
Prriop? 
Few of us stop to think how extensive is this acquisition 
on the part of normal children from average American homes - 
by the time they are five or six years old, nor have we given 
very much thought to the contributing factors in the truly 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
    ORAL ENGLISH A SOCIAL INSTRUMENT 195 
remarkable progress in language ability which most of them 
have made before starting to school. The facts connected 
with this successful learning ought to convey helpful impli- 
cations regarding successful teaching through the more con- 
scious processes of the school. 
We have available for this use numerous carefully made 
and exhaustive studies of the language abilities of individual 
children, and several of these indicate clearly some of the 
dominant factors in the learning process. 
One interesting phase of the subject is the sheer quantity 
of talk on the part of young children in the home. The 
actual count of this flow of speech is rather startling even to 
people who have lived very close to small chatterers.. Bran- 
denburg ! reports the number of different words used by his 
three-year-old daughter in one day as 859; total number of 
words uttered by her in that day, 11,623; number of sen- 
tences, 1873; number of interrogative sentences, 345. He 
says: 
If any one has any doubts as to the social tendency in children 
or its importance as a factor in language development, the number 
of words uttered in a day by a normal child ought to be fairly con- 
vincing. G spoke, during this day of twelve hours and fifteen 
minutes, approximately nine hundred and fifty words per hour.   
Other features worth noting are the very extensive yo- 
cabularies acquired by many young children and the situa- 
tions which seem to favor such acquisition. In a study of 
the language ability of a precocious little girl, Mildred 
Langenbeck ? says that she had a vocabulary of 6837 words 
at the age of five years. The list of words used was compiled 
from her unaided talk, “gathered chiefly while she played

alone, talking incessantly to herself, to her dolls, and to im- 
aginary companions.” Further on in the article the writer 
says, “She is never content until she knows the exact name 
for every new thing and its every part.” 
The marked and immediate influence of environment and 
first-hand experience upon a child’s vocabulary is shown by 
a study made by Margaret M. Nice.! The little girl she ob- 
served had a rich out-of-door life, and after reaching the age 
of about four years a very large percentage of new words ac- 
quired by her have to do with experiences relating to plants, 
animals, landscape, sky, etc. The writer says: 
Words may have very different concepts behind them according 
to one’s experience. A child who gets his language mainly from 
conversation with his elders, from playing with toys or looking at 
books and listening to stories has a less vivid foundation for his 
words than the child who lives with realities, with animals, plants 
and other children and has an opportunity to do things himself. 
Other studies have been made of the dominating motives 
which impel effort in learning to talk. Bohn? believes his 
child was more influenced by the desire for social relations 
and not so much by personal needs or the “sharp demand 
made by immediate environment.’’ He says: 
As time went on, words were used more and more to establish 
with those about her a common basis of understanding and en- 
joyment.... 
It seems to me as clear as anything can be in this uncertain realm 
that the child exerts ear and eye and vocal organs in order that 
it may enter into the social life of the wonderful giants with whom 
it lives. 
From such studies, as well as from our own less methodi-

cal and complete observations of children in the free life of 
the home, we can readily see that all of the laws governing 
the formation of habits have been strongly operative in 
building up language ability in the pre-school period. 
Abundant ezercise is the most conspicuous element in the 
process. Children talk incessantly unless silence is imposed, 
and the impulse toward verbal expression is so strong that 
powerful counter-forces are usually necessary to induce in- 
hibition in a healthy, wide-awake child, as all who are ac- 
quainted with children can testify. Original nature gives 
such a powerful “set” or “drive” toward speech that mere 
exercise of the power gives satisfaction, and repression causes 
annoyance or distress. After the earliest vocal play, the 
child uses speech in order to enter into more intimate rela- 
tions with those about him and to fulfill his desires and ac- 
complish his practical purposes. As these are the most 
fundamental and universal uses of language, the exercise: 
is getting is of a kind calculated to set up the bonds or con- 
nections most directly required in life. The force of the 
“drive” toward adequate and effective speech is augmented 
if adults really misunderstand a child’s imperfect speech, or 
if they are disposed to withhold what is desired until he has 
done his best to express himself verbally. Thus the law of 
effect is constantly operative. This law says that responses 
which bring pleasure or satisfaction are more likely to recur 
than those which are accompanied by dissatisfaction or an- 
noyance. Therefore steady improvement is made through 
effort to realize desired ends and in response to the mani- 
fested approval and disapproval of older people. 
Breadth of experience as well as abundant practice of the 
right kind is shown to be very important in developing lan- 
guage ability. Every new object calls for a name and for 
descriptive words; every new situation and relation carries 
with it appropriate verbal connections. It is a fact so well

known as scarcely to need mention that children who are in 
constant association with superior grown people, and who 
therefore-see, experience, and talk about things and events 
which would not ordinarily be in their range, usually develop 
rapidly in verbal expression; and the meager language equip- 
ment and mute condition of little ones who have lived long 
in an orphanage of the old type have been often remarked. 
These little prisoners have not seen, felt, touched, tasted, 
heard, or thought one tenth as much as have their more 
favored brothers and sisters, and of the impoverished life 
which surrounds them they are silent, dull witnesses rather 
than responsible and responsive participants. In the latter 
case, too, the absence of close personal contact with superior 
adults involves, of course, an immeasurable loss.

strangers; and even the notoriously voluble and shallow per- 
son usually has to yield the floor to the acknowledged expert 
in a given line. My friend has a new electric washing ma- 
chine which she displays to me, and which seems interesting 
and rather simple. I go home after seeing it and try to tell 
my family about it, with rather poor success. I did not see 
it in operation, much less did I handle it, and I find I cannot 
command the language needed for description because I am 
not really acquainted with the machine. My friend comes 
in another day, and, because she has operated it successfully, 
knows all the parts and their functions, and is enthusiastic 
about her new acquisition, she interests and satisfies every 
one who hears her tell of it. 
My eight-year-old neighbor can talk much more effectively 
and entertainingly about airplanes than Ican. Through his 
lively interest in everything pertaining to aviation, visits to 
aérodromes, talks with mechanicians and aviators, and ex- 
amination of every illustration and design he sees, he has a 
knowledge of the subject and a command of the required 
nomenclature and terminology far superior to mine. 
This natural, spontaneous use of language for genuine and 
immediate social and practical purposes results in an ability 
which functions readily in varied situations, provided ade- 
quate means are used to improve standards. There is no 
substitute for this sort of exercise. 
Wuat HAs THE ScHOOL OrreRED As A SUBSTITUTE? 
History shows that Pestalozzi, Froebel, and many of their 
successors in the kindergarten and primary school, as well as 
Madame Montessori, the latest propounder of a system of 
childhood education, have all tried to build up language 
ability through a more formal methodology. The old type 
of kindergarten emphasized the importance of having young 
children acquire such terms as sphere, cylinder, cube, cone,
-P-A-G-E-142
130 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
  corner, angle, edge, triangle, circle, obtuse, etc. As terms used 
in strictly dictated directions for placing blocks and folding 
paper, an artificial importance was attached to them in the 
kindergarten, but they sank into relative insignificance and 
disuse in life outside of school. ‘Tiny children, who could 
not tell their father’s name or distinguish between such com- 
mon words as plate and saucer, were drilled in mathematical 
terms through what was called play. In justice to the old- 
fashioned kindergarten, it should be said, however, that 
through excursions, conversation, stories, pictures, and the 
introduction of many concrete experiences of value, a more 
effective and serviceable training in language was going on 
at the same time. 
In the interests of an enlarged and supposedly workable 
vocabulary, Madame Montessori! likewise urges that a 
considerable number of the terms connected with her very 
extensive geometrical apparatus be taught to quite young 
children. She says: 
When the child shows that he can with security distinguish be- 
tween the forms of the plane geometric insets, the directress may 
begin the lessons in nomenclature. She should begin with two 
strongly contrasted forms, as the square and the circle, and should 
follow the usual method, using the three periods of Seguin. We do 
not teach all the names relative to the geometric figures, giving 
only those of the most familiar forms, such as square, circle, rec- 
tangle, triangle, oval.... 
Why should we consider it premature to teach the child the 
words circle, square, oval, when in his home he repeatedly hears 
the word round used in connection with plates, ete.? He will hear 
his parents speak of the square table, the oval table, etc., and these 
words in common use will remain for a long time confused in his 
mind and in his speech if we do not interpose such help as that we 
give in the teaching of forms. 
The children in the neighborhood of the school for which 
this recommendation was made will have very little use for 
1 Montessori, Maria: The Montessori Method, pp. 234-37. F. A. Stokes.
-P-A-G-E-143
  ORAL ENGLISH A SOCIAL INSTRUMENT 181 
the terms oval, rectangle, triangle, etc., for many years to 
come, and argument for teaching geometrical terms cannot 
be soundly based on the claim that such knowledge is needed 
to save young children from embarrassment and confusion 
when their elders are talking. A vocabulary of this sort 
is of very small importance as compared with one evolved 
from or connected with vital environmental experience. In 
fairness to Montessori’s entire scheme, it should be said that 
provision is made for a good deal of oral expression in other 
and more vital connections. 
The American primary school has shown a decided tend- 
ency to neglect the functional use of language in favor of 
formal drill. Ample evidence of this will be given in the 
next chapter. The earlier nature-study work was replete 
with attempts to teach the distinctive meanings of such 
words as opaque, translucent, truncated, dentate, serrate, etc., 
in connection with observations of isolated objects. Such 
lessons were inspired by the fallacy that one could by such 
means develop in the children a general power of observation 
and at the same time increase their active vocabulary. Be- 
yond the lessons in which such words were taught, it is 
probable that the children did not employ them in oral 
speech until many years later, if at all. The rapidity and 
certainty with which the average person incorporates tech- 
nical terms into his active vocabulary depend upon the vigor 
with which they were first impressed upon him and thé fre- 
quency with which situations arise where he cannot con- 
veniently avoid their use. I was grown before I felt abso- 
lutely certain of the distinction between warp and woof. 
Little children who are weaving soon apply these terms as 
readily and correctly as they do blue and red. The boy 
possessor of an electric battery quickly learns the difference 
between positive and negative in that connection, and children 
well prepared to stage an Indian play do not call a tepee an
-P-A-G-E-144
132 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
igloo. The vocabulary of the normal child will grow just as 
rapidly as vital situations are presented in which participa- 
tion requires that he learn to employ new terms with preci- 
sion and accuracy. In this connection, printed matter and 
pictures are better than nothing, but they are a poor substi- 
tute for overt action, first-hand experience, and associated, 
purposeful speech. 
Wuat May BE Exprectep FROM THE Usk or LANGUAGE 
GamEs? 
Much dependence is being placed upon so-called “lan- 
guage games”’ to establish certain desired speech habits. 
Reports from hundreds of primary teachers and examination 
of many textbooks, manuscripts, and magazine articles go to 
prove how popular is this mode of language teaching. Such 
exercises always call for much repetition of some phrase, 
sentence, or part of speech, and effort is made to give such 
practice a playful form in order to arouse and hold attention. 
Responses are often called for in chorus, and these games 
seldom demand a high degree of consciousness on the part of 
the children. At their worst, the effect of the mere unthink- 
ing repetition required is almost hypnotic. Reliance on 
drill of this kind assuredly counts too much upon one factor 
alone in the law of exercise — that of sheer repetition, and 
not enough upon the equally important correlative require- 
ments that this repetition shall set up the right bonds or 
neurone connections and in the right order. 
Examination and tests of these games show that many of 
them are calculated to set up bonds (build habits) which 
will never operate outside the particular class exercise under 
consideration. Others are of such nature that if by any 
miracle of psychological experience the speech habits aimed 
at should transfer over to everyday life, listeners would gaze 
at the speaker so trained as one from a strange and foreign 
   
-P-A-G-E-145
    ORAL ENGLISH A SOCIAL INSTRUMENT 133 
land where English had undergone weird transformations. 
The following example illustrates both of these points: 
To teach It is I, It is not I. Game for first and second grade. 
Teacher. “Let us play we are going to have a party. Shall we 
get the refreshments ready? We ought to try to have things that 
every one likes.” 
Teacher. ‘‘Who is it that likes chocolate cake?” 
The children answer in concert according to their taste, “It is I”; 
Or, it isnot A. 
Teacher. “Who is it that likes oranges?” 
Again children reply in concert, “It is I”; “It is not I.” 
Other items are presented by the teacher in the same 
manner. 
Then the time for serving the imaginary refreshments 
arrives. 
Teacher. “Who is it that wishes chocolate cake?” 
Children reply, “It is 1”; “It is not I.” 
Each item is “served” in the same way until the teacher 
declares that the party is over. 
The situation around which this exercise is built is so un- 
like any natural life experience that there is not the slightest 
chance that the form “It is I’ will transfer over, even 
though the children repeat the expression in this game a 
thousand times. And if it should carry over, how aghast we 
should be at the result! Does the host say to guests at his 
table, ““Who is it that likes the white meat?” ‘Who is.it 
that likes the dark meat?” And do the guests reply, “It 
wes “Ee isnot 17? 
The phrases are perhaps grammatically correct, but they 
are socially entirely incorrect and absurd in the setting 
given. Yet the only possible occasion for their use would 
be social, and even this exercise attempts vainly to give a 
social setting. Such attempts are like sharpening a poor
-P-A-G-E-146
  134 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
tool which will never be used, instead of treating language 
as a genuine social instrument to be employed so often, so 
naturally, and in such varied situations in school as to be 
made ready and adequate for expanding uses outside of 
school. 
Another game intended to make habitual the phrase “‘It 
is I” is conducted as follows: One child in the room closes his 
eyes. Another child, silently chosen, leaves the room and 
shuts the door. He then raps on the door, and the one 
whose eyes are closed calls out, “Who is there?” The other 
is expected to reply, “It is I.” Question and answer are 
repeated until the listening child judges from the voice who 
is rapping. As sometimes played, a wrong guess, as, for 
example, Charles, brings the response in chorus from the rest 
of the class, ‘‘ No, it isn’t Charles”’; or, if the teacher wishes 
small children to be prigs in the use of English, she tries to 
train them to say, “No, it is not he.” 
This play situation is much more like real life than the 
first described, the usage employed (exclusive of the last 
alternative phrase cited) is more like the common speech of 
educated people about us, and therefore the chances are 
better that such drill will tend to establish connections . 
which will be “touched off” and bring the desired response 
should a similar situation naturally arise. But what is the 
relative importance of forming the habit of saying “‘It is I,” 
“Tt is not I,” at this age as compared with other speech 
habits? A considerable number of primary pupils in the 
schools of this country are at a stage where really gross errors 
are common among them, yet through such exercises as 
those described they are being drilled on refinements of 
speech involving delicate distinctions between shall and will, 
should and would, and the fixation of a usage so infrequently 
called for as, “If it should not be they.” 
Many of these devices employ terms so unnatural, so un-
-P-A-G-E-147
  ORAL ENGLISH A SOCIAL INSTRUMENT 135 
common, that extensive preliminary drill on the required 
forms is necessary before children can be counted upon to 
respond according to the rules of the “game.’’ Perfectly 
correct and generally acceptable phrases must be suppressed 
because they do not happen to be the forms demanded in a 
given exercise. In other words, pupils must be drilled upon 
how to go through a certain drill. The “party” lesson illus- 
trates this point. Another example is found in the exercise 
sometimes called The Fairy’s Touch: One child is chosen to 
be the “fairy.” The others close their eyes. The “fairy” 
runs lightly about the room touching other children here and 
there. Ata signal, eyes are opened, and one of the number 
questions thus: “James, was it you the fairy touched?” 
James must reply, “No, it was not I”’; or, “Yes, it was I.” 
As usually performed, this question is put to every child in 
the class until all have answered. The natural query would 
be, “James, did the fairy touch you?” and the commonly 
accepted reply would be, either ““No, Mary”; ‘““No, Miss 
Brown”’; or, “No, she didn’t touch me.”’ But if these forms 
were permitted, the desired practice would be defeated; 
therefore, they must be suppressed. 
If children must learn to suppress perfectly correct as well 
as grossly incorrect forms of speech, when and how are they 
to learn the difference? May not this sort of suppression 
and substitution retard rather than aid in the development 
of ready, natural, and pleasing speech in everyday life? 
Honest answers based upon thoughtful consideration of 
the following questions would prevent much of this sort of 
waste in time and energy: 
1. Considering the maturity and advancement of these particu- 
lar children, is the error involved a glaring one? 
2. Is the substitute form socially as well as grammatically cor- 
rect? 
38. Is the substitute form stilted and bookish or is it good idio- 
matic English?
-P-A-G-E-148
136 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
4, Is the correspondence between the drill situation and daily 
life sufficiently close to warrant belief that the habit formed 
will come into play in real conversation and genuine expres- 
sion of ideas? 
5. Could the habit be established more economically and surely 
by increasing the opportunities for purposeful, natural use of 
language combined with friendly criticism? 
Varipty IN Practice Is NEEDED 
Practice in oral English should be as varied as possible 
because life’s uses are varied. We speak of certain individu- 
als as ‘‘natural-born talkers,” and it is true that individual 
differences are great in this ability as in all others, but two 
people having apparently equal verbal facility may not ac- 
quit themselves equally well in like situations. To a con- 
siderable extent, mastery in this realm as elsewhere is spe- 
cific. One may be a good soap-box orator and a poor con- 
versationalist at a dinner party, and vice versa. On this 
point O’Shea ! makes an apt and forcible statement when he 
says, “A man is effective linguistically in those situations 
and only those in which he has often been placed, in reaction 
upon which he has been constantly urged by force of cireum- 
stances, to express himself readily and to the point.” 
In the light of this principle, we should be careful not to 
overwork or put too great reliance upon story-reproduction, 
dramatization, or any other single means of securing practice 
in speaking, no matter how admirable the exercise may seem 
in itself. It is certain to be one-sided and inadequate for 
training in pleasing, and childlike speech in the many and 
varied occasions which daily life presents. Memorization of 
a story verbatim and its subsequent reproduction are less 
likely to influence a child’s speech habits than is the frequent 
telling of the story for pleasure, without exact memorization,

  138 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
but with the aid of sympathetic criticism. It is in summon- 
ing ideas, arranging and organizing them, and finding suit- 
able words in which to express them that the fullest exercise 
consists. i 
The only way to secure practice in oral English which will 
. be adequate from the standpoint of quantity, variety, and 
conformity to correct and natural usage is to have the work 
of the class and the school so arranged that there shall be 
ample opportunity for free expression in connection with 
all kinds of interesting and intrinsically valuable activities. 
Things must be going on that are worth talking about, and 
to this end the school must help to establish wider contacts 
with the best which the environment offers. Pupils will dis- 
cuss with the teacher plans for group projects of all kinds. 
Committees will meet and report regarding various under- 
takings, such as dramatic performances, proposed assembly 
participation, or club affairs. They will compose “speeches” 
and practice them for more formal occasions, such as acting 
as emissaries to other rooms to make announcements or 
extend invitations, making reports on interesting experi- 
ences which all have not enjoyed, or imparting needed in- 
formation. They will prepare dialogues for puppet shows, 
and will talk freely about what they read. Nothing can 
take the place of such informal and semi-formal intercourse. 
School life of this type approximates in linguistic oppor- 
tunity a full, rich, natural community life, and offers in addi- 
tion the aid of an alert teacher ready to note the stage of 
progress attained by the pupils and competent to help them 
to improve. In what other way can she really know their 
language needs and furnish the necessary assistance? 
When the teacher has discovered that certain incorrect 
forms are common, the children can be made conscious of 
them by degrees, and then some drill exercises (perhaps at 
times a few of the best language games) may be used with 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
    ORAL ENGLISH A SOCIAL INSTRUMENT 139 
good effect. Children will work hard and in fine spirit to 
eliminate certain errors if the general atmosphere of the 
room is encouraging and if there are many occasions where 
they are ambitious to speak well. Successful teachers work 
on a few of the most serious and most common errors at a 
time. A definite goal is set to eliminate certain errors in 
a given year. In some localities, a first- or second-grade 
teacher might feel well content if, out of a multitude of gross 
mistakes, the majority of her pupils learn to avoid ain’t, I 
seen, have saw, and we was. An inspiring and fun-loving 
teacher can enlist the effort of her class by making an in- 
formal and casual game out of “Shutting the schoolroom 
door on Ain’t.” ‘“‘Let’s see if we can keep him out of our 
room this week.”’ “Did Ain’t get in?” ‘‘Who let him in?” 
“He will follow you to school as long as you will allow him 
to,” ete. Gcod-natured checking of this kind continues, but 
is never allowed to become nagging. The spirit of good- 
fellowship and codperation must be maintained. One after 
another, other “ragged fellows,” I seen, We was, etc., are 
dealt with and not allowed to show their heads. 
Have not the more sympathetic teachers of young children 
been too afraid of introducing the conscious element in cor- 
rection? There has been a disposition on their part to de- 
pend almost entirely on indirect correction and unconscious 
imitation. The latter methods can hardly be relied upon to 
break up a fixed habit which outside influences tend con- 
stantly to deepen. Conscious effort and well-directed desire 
must come in as factors at some stage. May they not be 
used to advantage as early as first grade? 
Over-Pepantic Requirements Derrat More 
Important Enps 
The propriety of any given response should be determined 
by the situation and not by arbitrary edict. To say that 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  140 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
children should always speak in complete sentences is to say 
that they should speak in a manner different from that which 
is habitual among educated adults. In discussing this ques- 
tion with classes composed of primary teachers and school 
principals, the writer has frequently found them using in- 
complete sentences in the very act of arguing that young 
pupils should not be permitted to do so. The pedantry of 
the demand when applied to all schoolroom situations will be 
seen if one listens to ordinary, polite interchange among 
acquaintances or reads the conversation in a well-written 
modern novel or play. To require that children shall al- 
ways rise, step into the aisle, take a certain posture, and 
refrain from touching any object while speaking is, again, to 
lay down strictures which would kill any meeting of adults 
assembled for interchange of ideas. Members of college 
classes in Primary Education have been known to insist 
upon such regulations for children, themselves carrying 
on the argument while comfortably seated. Why make a 
fetish in school of forms which elsewhere in life are merely 
made to serve a useful purpose? 
This does not mean that slipshod, careless, inadequate ex- 
pression, slouchy posture, and discourteous demeanor should 
be allowed to pass unnoticed and become habitual. The 
virtue of the complete sentence is that it conveys a complete 
meaning to some one who is listening. The incomplete 
sentence does not always do this. Except in lively and 
intimate interchange, complete sentences will usually be 
needed in order to make one’s meaning clear. The social 
situation should determine posture also. A certain position 
when addressing others fits one octasion and does not fit 
another. The wise teacher leads the children to see this 
early in the year, and helps them to make habitual those 
responses which contribute best to the pleasure, comfort, 
and profit of all.
-P-A-G-E-153
ORAL ENGLISH A SOCIAL INSTRUMENT 141 
Many of the improvements widely advocated to-day for 
the primary school have to wait on appropriations for furni- 
ture, materials, reduced number of pupils per teacher, in- 
creased space, or other physical changes beyond the control 
of principal or teacher. But a fair approximation of the 
purposeful work in language here suggested can be attained 
in any school where conditions are halfway right. For the 
children have their tongues. They are also endowed by 
nature with curiosity, with inquiring minds, so that speakers 
and audience are always ready for anything that appeals to 
childish interest. A school that is at all alive calls for much 
discussion of worth-while things. The activities may of 
necessity be more meager, less suggestive, than could be 
desired while we await more generous provision for the lower 
grades, but purposeful, varied, and eager expression through 
language can nevertheless be abundantly called forth unless 
the teacher is bound to a different course by oppressive 
authority.

  CHAPTER VIII 
TO WHAT EXTENT IS ORAL LANGUAGE ALLOWED TO 
FUNCTION IN PRIMARY GRADES ? 
¥ Tue function of language is to enable us to communicate 
for practical and social ends. In theory our schools have 
largely accepted this social viewpoint as regards the mastery 
of language. We have been told for many years that it is 
the duty of the primary school to make the language work 
function in the daily life of the children; that the best way 
to make growth more certain and rapid is to provide abun- 
dant opportunity for natural, easy speech. The following 
passages, taken almost at random from courses of study of 
ten or a dozen cities, show the prevalent theory. 
Teachers in primary grades should seek to create the language 
environment of a cultivated home. 
The mechanics of language should be subordinated to the pupil’s 
thought and feeling. 
The chief object of the language work of the first grade is to train 
the pupils to talk freely and connectedly about things and events 
that enter into their lives. 
A part of the language work should consist of simple conversa- 
tions which should be as free as possible. 
One of the aims of oral instruction and language is free expres- 
sion. 
The language of the first grade should be largely oral and pupils 
should be encouraged to talk freely. 
Provide a natural social atmosphere and encourage the children 
to talk freely about affairs that interest them. 
An investigation made in 1916-17 ! shows common prac- 
1 Moore, Annie E.: “A Quantitative Study of Oral English in the 
Primary Grades”’; in Teachers College Record, May, 1919.
-P-A-G-E-155
  ORAL LANGUAGE IN PRIMARY GRADES 148 
tice greatly at variance with this theory. Visits, lasting 
from two to three hours each, were made in one hundred and 
twenty-seven different first-grade classrooms in twelve cities 
widely distributed over the country, for the purpose of 
finding out just what sort of language work was going on 
in representative schools. The specific question was, “To 
what extent is free oral expression permitted in the lower 
grades?” The term “free” was not meant to cover mere 
chatter at rest periods, intermissions, etc. It was intended 
to designate the natural, purposeful use of language distin- 
guished from set exercise or formal drill as it occurred during 
the regular program. The observers were seeking oral ex- 
pression which appeared to measure up to the standards pre- 
sented in the courses of study just quoted. These quota- 
tions are taken from published curricula of the schools 
investigated. 
The only types of oral expression excluded from the count 
were: Reading, when carried on without discussion or com- 
ment; memorized selections; dramatization, when eaact 
words of text were required; phonic work and drill exercises 
demanding exact phraseology. Some of the types sought 
and recorded as “‘free’’ were: Class discussion; natural con- 
versation about subjects of interest; dramatization in which 
pupils had some opportunity to shape the dialogue; story 
reproduction as distinguished from pure memorization; and 
any spontaneous remarks or questions of pupils in relation 
to various activities. 
It was at first intended to have extensive observations 
made in the first three grades, but not enough assistance 
could be secured to accomplish this, so it was decided to ob- 
serve in first grades only. It was thought that the policy 
governing upper primary was not likely to be more liberal 
than that controlling the youngest children — recent en- 
trants from kindergarten and home. 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Some of the most striking discoveries briefly stated were 
as follows: : 
In City No. 11, nineteen and a half hours were spent in ten 
classrooms, about two hours in each room. In all this time, 
only five minutes were occupied by oral expression which 
could by the most liberal interpretation be called free and 
natural. With this exception all the time in all the rooms 
visited was devoted to exercises in which the children were 
required to speak in a rigidly limited manner or to be ab- 
solutely silent. 
In another city, twenty-nine hours. spent in thirteen 
rooms discovered a total of thirty-three minutes of free ex- 
pression. 
The most liberal practice in this regard was found in City 
No.10, where about sixteen hours spent in eight rooms showed 
the children engaged in activities permitting spontaneous, 
natural expression two and three quarters hours, or seventeen 
and a half per cent of the time. Tables II, IV, and V 
show the full results of observations in three different cities. 
Table III gives the facts for City No. 11, where the least free 
expression was found; Table IV shows City No. 10, which 
permitted the greatest amount; and Table V shows City No. 
2, which represents the median for the twelve cities studied. 
The full report ' gives the distribution of 127 observations 
in as many different classrooms according to the amount of 
free oral expression found in each. It shows that in 39 
rooms there was absolutely no such use of language; in 37 
rooms it occupied 5 minutes or less. Putting these two 
groups together, we see that in 76 out of 127 rooms there 
were 5 minutes or less of such exercise during the hours of 
observation. The median time devoted to this type of ex- 
pression in all rooms visited was less than 5 minutes out of 
2 hours plus.

Explanation. Ten rooms visited; 353 children observed; total time spent 
in 10 rooms, 19} hours. In all, 5 minutes were given to “free, oral ex- 
pression,”’ which is two fifths of one per cent of all observation time. In 
the 10 rooms combined, a total of 22 children spoke in the manner de- 
scribed. In this city the first-grade children in schools visited may be said 
to have been entirely silent except in formal drill. 
This investigation was made about seven years ago. 
More recent but much less extensive visits give evidence 
that practice is becoming more liberal in several of these 
cities. In others, where the general level is still very low, 
individual schools are following a much more liberal policy. 
There is good reason to believe that in at least five of the 
cities concerned, there are to-day, just as at this earlier date, 
thousands of young children who are quite mute in school 
except when they read orally or reply with great brevity in 
some stereotyped drill lesson. 
That the restriction is not necessarily due to large classes 
may be seen from Table VI. This gives the average number

It will be seen that City No. 1, with an average attendance 
of 43, does better in the matter concerned than City No. 6 
with an average of 33, and far better than City No. 11 with 
an average of 35. Compare also cities No. 3 and No. 9. 
The average attendance in the two is the same — 38. In 
No. 3, two per cent of time is used for “applied” language, 
and in No. 9, fourteen per cent of time is used in this way. 
Those who conducted this investigation found abundant 
proof that different practices were the result of different con- 
ceptions of education. It was evident that a certain policy 
controlled in any given system. In some there was a “con- 
spiracy of silence.’ Children were evidently expected to

grow in language power entirely by listening to the teacher 
or by set drill exercises. In a few of the places observed, 
notably in cities No. 5 and No. 10, the children participated 
actively in a large part of the program. There was no more 
time set aside for language on the daily schedule in these 
schools than in the other systems, but there was a marked 
tendency to encourage the children to discuss what they 
were doing, to ask questions, to reply freely and fully, and to 
help make plans for various affairs of school life. Language 
functioned normally a considerable part of the day and the 
teachers had many opportunities to help the children to 
improve. 
Is the introduction of a large amount of silent reading 
going to cut off almost the only opportunity which children 
have in some schools to be articulate? In cities No. 2, 3, 4, 
6, 7, 8, and 11 (see Table VI), first-grade children were 
scarcely vocal at all except when they read orally. Substi- 
tute in these cities certain kinds of silent-reading exercises in 
place of oral, and the children will become mute indeed dur- 
ing school hours. In such exercises as the following they are 
not allowed to speak but must perform these futile illogical 
acts in perfect silence: 
Put the red box on the green mat. 
Go to the girl by the door and touch her dress. ‘ 
Get a big block. ‘Take it to the man by the window. 
Tf you are six years old, clap your hands and make a bow. 
Tf you have a sister in this school, come to me and shake hands. 
Go to the lady in the back of the room. ‘Tell her how tall you 
are, and ask her if she lives on First Street. 
Silent ‘“‘stunts”’ of this type should be used in moderation. 
If introduced to any extent in a non-English-speaking school 
population, then the opportunities for purposeful speech 
should be greatly increased in other ways. 
There is another kind of silent reading which not only
-P-A-G-E-161
ORAL LANGUAGE IN PRIMARY GRADES 149 
serves the particular purposes of building up efficient reading 
habits, but also provides a most profitable and developing 
type of oral expression. I refer to carefully supervised 
silent reading of worth-while material followed by or inter- 
spersed with pointed discussion calculated to reveal the 
depth and extent of meaning obtained. This kind of silent 
reading provides, far better than did the old-fashioned oral 
reading, for purposive, thoughtful, and somewhat original 
expression of ideas. It is one of the best means of furnish- 
ing immature children with a common body of interesting 
subject-matter for conversation. 
QUESTIONS 
1. If the point of view presented in passages quoted is sound, are 
the pupils observed in City No. 11 getting any effective train- 
ing in speech? 
2. You may find it interesting to compare the total number of 
children present in rooms observed in City No. 2 with the 
number who actually spoke. Also the amount of time any 
child could have had if each child present had spoken even 
once. (See Table V.) City No. 2 is cited because it repre- 
sents median practice. 
3. City No. 1@ did not have any more time allotted to language 
on the daily schedule for first grades than City No. 11. In 
what ways might one account for the great difference in the 
amount of free oral expression found in the two cities? 
4. Are the facts given in this chapter at all representative of any 
schools which you know? Have you ever actually timed the 
amount of different types of oral expression in a classroom?  
-P-A-G-E-162
  CHAPTER IX 
WHAT ARE THE CONTROLLING FACTORS IN WRITTEN 
/ EXPRESSION ? 
( Ir is a long step from the free, spontaneous speech of child- 
| hood to the stage where ideas can be expressed clearly and 
pleasingly in written form/ In racial development the art of 
writing is relatively modern. There is, therefore, no deep- 
seated tendency toward it established in the human organ- 
ism, no instinctive ‘‘readiness”’ which will serve to urge the 
individual forward as in the case of spoken language. We 
discussed in Chapter VII the strong, impelling forces in the 
acquisition of the latter art, forces so urgent, resting upon 
instincts so strong, that the young quickly acquire remark- 
able power without the aid of direct and conscious teaching. 
“The expression “‘Art is long” truly applies to the mastery 
of all the skills involved in written language. In most 
schools, children make some beginning in the first or second 
grade, and if they go to college, they will still be studying 
English composition in their second year, making about four- 
teen years in all. If they complete only the work of the 
elementary school, they will devote a good deal of time to 
written English for six or eight years and will, in most cases, 
graduate with a very imperfect mastery of the art. A com- 
paratively small but a highly important part of this course 
belongs in the primary years. The way the subject is begun, 
the habits that are fostered, and the standards that are set 
up will go far toward determining the success or failure of the 
later elementary course. 
Wuat SHALL BE THE APPROACH TO THIS ComPLEX ART? 
We have again the old, insistent question of how to main- 
tain a balance between content and form, purpose and pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  
  FACTORS IN WRITTEN EXPRESSION 151 
cess. This question is unusually urgent in the matter of 
written expression because two new and difficult skills are 
involved, spelling and handwriting. 
There is probably less real and evident need for writing in 
the daily life of most children than there is for reading and 
arithmetic. There are fewer situations which in and of 
themselves move the young to make an effort to write. Al- 
most all children

and sometimes even having the broken effect of a suc- 
cession of words. Such children can usually tell you what

norance for a brief time rids itself of all the bother of spell- 
ing and penmanship and “writes” freely and fluently. (See 
Figs. 17 and 18.) Other children accept very early the 
demands of spelling, fall back upon straight-line printing as 
a medium, and by dint of pursuing their elders to spell 
words for them produce little letters which function, at least 
when the recipient is a fond relative. Such a letter printed 
by a five-year-old is shown in Fig. 19.

She calls her effort a letter and succeeds in producing the general appearance of writing.   
This desire to communicate is, of course, the great funda- 
mental one in writing. Ancient man wanted to communi- 
cate with his fellows when separated from them by space, 
and gradually evolved a system of symbols by which, on 
wood and stone, on skin and papyrus, he could send his 
message. He wanted also to reach those separated from 
him by time, and he cut, carved, and drew these symbols 
on the most permanent material available, recording event

and circumstance which he deemed important. Fancy was 
sometimes mixed with fact in these ancient records, and thus 
the creative instinct found expression through graphic art. 
We have gone far since primitive times in the how of 
writing, but the why remains the same; we desire to com- 
municate, to record, or to create. The average person is 
moved by the first two needs or desires far oftener than

Smvce Purpose 1s AN EssentiaAL Factor in WRITTEN 
EXPRESSION, Wuat OBJECTIVES ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT 
FOR CHILDREN? 
In an effort to get a rough estimate of the most common 
everyday uses of written language, several large groups of 
graduate students have been asked to enumerate them ac- 
cording to their own judgment. They were directed to dis- 
regard their written work as university students and all 
special professional work, such as that of teachers, lawyers, 
and preachers, and to confine themselves to uses for writing 
which they found in their own personal, social, and business 
relations. These uses or needs were to be listed as nearly as 
possible in the order of frequency, putting first those be- 
lieved to be most frequently recurrent, and last, those which 
seldom arise. These lists were prepared in class without 
previous warning. ‘Those participating were given only 
about ten minutes in which to think, the object being to pre- 
vent them from searching their minds for the infrequent and 
unusual. Almost all of these lists contain the first seven 
items in the sample given below. Comparatively few of 
them include the last three items. The order in which these 
items appear closely approximated in most cases that of the 
sample. Letters and memoranda invariably came first, while 
copying and reproducing, if mentioned at all, occurred far 
down in the lists, showing that the writers regarded them as 
of relatively small importance.

When adults begin to examine closely into the ways in 
which they ordinarily employ writing, they are usually sur- 
prised at the infrequency and meagerness of the output in 
all directions except that of letter-writing. Educated, non- 
professional people, of course, vary to a considerable extent 
in the amount and kind of writing produced, but for most of 
us communicating, in the narrow sense of the term, is the one 
great demand. Next to this seem to come records of various 
sorts which the individual desires to make for temporary or 
more permanent use and satisfaction, It is an interesting
-P-A-G-E-168
  156 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
fact that the ordinary citizen seems to have little or no use 
for the three kinds of exercises which the primary school has 
demanded more than any others, copying, taking dictation, 
and reproducing stories. 
It is highly probable that in the free life of children outside 
of school and in a rich varied school life having a social at- 
mosphere and organization, many of these same needs will 
arise. Youth and inexperience may, however, cause them 
to assume different comparative values. The fourth item, 
business papers, may drop out altogether; copying and taking 
dictation may rise to greater prominence through genuine 
need; and more scope may be found for creative work in the 
play life of children than in the prosaic life of the average 
adult. Considering the dominant interests of the younger 
children, probably personal communications of all kinds and 
personal records furnish for them as for their elders the 
strongest, most genuine, and most frequently recurrent 
appeal. The important point is that beyond the purely 
scribble stage there must be some genuine use and purpose 
for writing if we are to train in any but the most technical 
features of the art, such as penmanship and spelling. 
Lerrer-WritInG 1s AN ExceLLent Startine-Point 
For many years a good deal of attention has been given 
to the matter of letter-writing in elementary grades. The 
strength of the appeal to little children, however, has not 
been so commonly recognized. We have seen how mere 
babies delight in sending messages in their own penciled 
scrawl, and it is an easy and natural step for the primary- 
school child to learn really to write tiny messages. At what- 
ever period writing is begun, whether in advanced first or in 
second grade, children delight in learning to write surprise 
notes to take home to father and mother or to tuck into the 
letter which an older person is sending to a relative or friend.
-P-A-G-E-169
  FACTORS IN WRITTEN EXPRESSION 157 
Such phrases and sentences as, My love; Love to mother; 
Three kisses; Six kisses to daddie; Your litile boy; Your little 
girl; I love you; Come to see us; Come home soon; I am well; I 
want to see you; I did good work — written by children and 
sent or delivered to the appropriate person — constitute a 
beginning in written expression conceived of as a means of 
personal communication. 
Greetings for various seasons and occasions should play a 
like part. Happy Easter; Merry Christmas; A Happy Birth- 
day to ——; We missed you, (supply name of child who 
has been absent); We are glad to see you back; Welcome to our 
room — may be written on paper and delivered, or attached 
to the bulletin board, or written on the blackboard to greet 
the eyes of an individual or a group, as suits the case. Chil- 
dren should very early learn to participate in putting needed 
instructions and injunctions on the blackboard; such as, 
Please do not erase; Please save; Please be quiet; Do not forget 
to clean up; The play will be at ten o'clock; It is time to stop; 
Look at the clock; Be on time, ete. 
The reality and sense of importance that attaches to work 
of this kind as compared to the perfunctory exercises so 
common in primary grades is shown by an incident that hap- 
pened in a second grade. A meeting of the grade mothers 
was to be held one afternoon in a second-grade room. The 
» children were learning to write greetings and messages of 
various kinds to be written on the blackboard and left there 
for the mothers to read. One little girl said her mother was 
not very well and might not be able to come to the meeting. 
She asked to learn how to write, I hope you will not be sick. 
While she was practicing the sentence on paper, her mother 
unexpectedly entered the room. She finished the paper and, 
childlike, took it to her mother instead of waiting and carry- 
ing out the original plan for the afternoon meeting. Pre- 
sently she was seen to be weeping bitterly, and it was dis-  
-P-A-G-E-170
  158 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
covered that her mother‘had laughingly pointed out a mis- 
take in her work. She had omitted one little word, and her 
message read, I hope you will be sick. The child was deeply 
distressed when she realized what she had said. Many 
children have shed tears during the painful process of writ- 
ing “compositions,’”’ but few have done so because stirred 
by the meaning conveyed. 
“There are systems of teaching penmanship which forbid or 
vigorously discourage the use of writing to express real ideas 
in the beginning stages. Some advocates of these systems 
claim that writing is being used as a means of expression 
when young children are drilled to write, See me; I can see; 
Men see; See the nut; See the nest, etc. The difference be- 
tween such phrases, produced as a penmanship exercise and 
the genuine message, is obvious to any one, and the clear- 
sighted sincerity of children makes them especially keen 
in recognizing the difference. Whether the technical diffi- 
culties involved in learning to write make it inadvisable to 
begin with real ideas is another question which will be dis- 
cussed in the next chapter. 
From the message or note which can be expressed in a 
single sentence, the complete letter will gradually be devel- 
oped. The body of the letter may be very brief, but a few 
of the essential elements of form will now be taught. , If, 
however, we really care about helping children to develop 
the ability to write an interesting letter, we will be careful 
not to go too fast in the matter of form and will keep atten- 
tion strongly centered on meaning and purpose. This can 
be done only through the frequent writing of real letters to 
real people. The imaginary letter to an imaginary person 
is a very poor substitute. 
Even in the topsy-turvy world of Alice in Wonderland it 
was considered unreasonable to suppose that a letter would 
be written to “nobody.” In the trial of the Knave of 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
     FACTORS IN WRITTEN EXPRESSION 159 
Hearts, the White Rabbit offers as evidence a mysterious 
paper which has just been picked up. 
“What’s in it?” said the Queen. 
“T haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems 
to be a letter written by the prisoner to — to somebody.” 
“Tt must be that,” said the King, “‘unless it was written to no- 
body, which isn’t usual, you know.” 
Any one who has ever received spontaneous letters from a 
child knows that they are very different from the usual text- 
book model. They are also very much better in all except 
possibly the formal aspects. The model letter may be useful 
in fixing certain habits and establishing certain desirable 
customs, it may serve as a convenient reference when the 
learner is uncertain as to an approved form, but no one ever 
learned to write a letter that others would care to read by 
consulting or imitating models. 
I have been collecting children’s letters for a long time, 
and I now have specimens ranging from the tiny sheet, con- 
taining only a few words printed in large capitals by a six- 
year-old, to the well-written and well-expressed friendly 
letter from a mature twelve-year-old. I have also a few of 
the kind that are produced by children when some over- 
anxious and over-ambitious grown-up stands over them and 
requires that they turn out a perfect product. Such letters 
are perfect only in the sense that there are no mistakes in 
spelling, punctuation, and arrangement, and that the writ- 
ing is as good as the child can produce by the utmost care 
and perhaps only after making several copies. As letters, 
they are not much better than a blank sheet would have 
been. They say very little, and that little does not come 
from the child’s heart and mind. When our own little son 
or daughter, niece or nephew, or child friend writes to us, 
most of us would prefer to get the true spirit and flavor of 
the uniz ue individual even though there are some mistakes.      
-P-A-G-E-172

Indeed, it is the naive thought, original expression, and im- 
perfect form which make children’s letters so delightful. 
Compare the following letters. The first three were 
written as a class exercise in a third grade. Thirty-five 
children were expected to write about the same thing, and 
the subject was one regarding which they were evidently 
densely ignorant. Their “letters”? were to be addressed to 
the teacher, who knew all about the subject. Indeed, it was 
she who had “‘learned”’ them about dew.

The children show that they know something about capi-

tion, and closing of a letter, but do they know anything 
about real letter-writing?

old to a relative with whom he was on terms of intimate com- 
radeship. When together they were real churgeeehe boy’s

mother believed that a child should never be permitted to 
make the slightest error if it were possible by watchful over- 
sight and correction to prevent it. The result in this case 
was a message of ten words written with incredible perfec- 
tion, but not a touch of the real boy is there in it.

Dear Miss C _ 
Have you ever thought of your little curly headed girl, since you 
went away? - 
I have thought of you lots of times, and wish I could see you. 
Now I can laugh at you sitting in school studying while I am run- 
ning around on the farm bare footed and having a good time. 
July 16, Sister, William and I went to a Sunday School picnic. A 
thunder cloud came up and we had to come home in the rain, we 
had lots of fun and lots of good things to eat.

The last example is also a home letter preserved for over a 
quarter of a century by the one to whom it was addressed. 
This little eight-year-old girl made some mistakes, but she 
told just the things “Aunt Grace” would have wanted to 
know and succeeded in conveying the spirit of cordiality 
which was a strong family characteristic. 
November 20, 1898 
Dear Aunt Grace, 
Lhope you are well We all went to Sunday School and Dorothy 
went in a kindergarten class We were all vacinated last Tuesday 
in two spots Anna and Dorothy have a new drass and in the 
second grade We are all well and I hope all of your little scollars 
are well I hope that you can come down thanksgiving and Christ- 
mas both Anna birthday is next week and I hope you will be 
down any way Mama has a mew cape and waist a she has a verry 
big coldsore on her lip. Dorothy a I have a mew coat I went 
down to Grandma’s three weeks ago and stayed all might I an 
letting my hair grow long 
This is all that I can think of 
from Margaret G—— 
We should try to make children feel that it is possible to 
have a good time in writing letters, for of course the purely 
friendly letter is a poor thing unless there is evidence that 
the writer did experience some satisfaction in writing it. To 
this end a collection of letters freely written by other chil-' 
dren will be a great help. A number of these may be read to 
the class, and they will see that in some the writers were hav- 
ing a good time in writing and that others give evidence of no 
such attitude. It is easy to obtain original, spontaneous, 
and lively letters written by children to use as examples. If

untrammeled child correspondents are lacking, one has only 
to ask one’s friends to contribute from letters which they are 
receiving. 
An Important Factor 1n Written EnGuisH 1s Founp 
IN THE CuiLp’s Own Limitations 
It is important that some sort of balance be kept between 
what pupils wish to do and their ability to accomplish the 
end. If mastery of the tools is to be acquired through daily 
use, we must see to it that the undertakings are not too am- 
bitious at first. The one thing that upper-grade teachers 
beg primary teachers to accomplish is the development of 
the sentence sense. The lack of this sense is seen often in 
the high school, where students offer a phrase or a long form- 
less succession of phrases as a sentence. One sometimes 
meets college students who seem not to know the difference 
between a complete and an incomplete statement. 
The small plans of the younger children calling for brief 
records and memoranda offer excellent natural occasions for 
learning to write simple sentences. Only a little needs to be 
said by the child and he can be taught to say that little com- 
pletely. The following entries made by a little third-grade 
girl in the school diary illustrate the point. Each child in 
the class made a book which they called a diary. In it they 
recorded the principal things which they did during the 
period of the day called “free time.” At this period they 
had considerable latitude of choice as to occupations and the 
record was to show what choices they had made. 
On the outside cover of this particular book the child 
printed — What I do in free time. These are a few of the 
items which she entered between January 5 and May 19, 
1922. 
Jan. 5. I made my free time diary book. 
Jan. 6. I fixed my spelling book. I finished a book.
-P-A-G-E-176
  164 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Jan. 11. I spent all my free time in the library. 
Jan. 17. I made a counter for a flag game. 
Jan. 19. I started to make a doll for my sister. 
Feb. 1. I had to begin my doll over again. My doll was not 
made correctly. 
April 13. I helped to fix Joan’s birthday table. 
April 20. I made a May basket. 
May 18. I wrote a composition about clean cows for our milk 
movie. 
If children keep some sort of a record of daily happenings, 
a clear concept of the simple sentence can be well established 
by the end of the third grade by this one means alone. It 
may be in the form of individual books like the above or 
individual daily cards may be filed. If the school is so 
organized that there is a dearth of interesting individual 
items to be recorded, then a composite class book may be 
kept in which children will take turns in entering items of 
interest to all. The group in this case will usually decide 
what is to be told, and thus they will obtain practice in 
formulating good statements. The following records are 
taken from a second-grade ‘‘Class Book”’ of this sort. 
Dec. 10. We saw the First Grade play. 
Dec. 20. We made chains for the Christmas tree. 
Jan. 8. It is snowing hard today. 
Feb. 12. We made some pretty Valentines. 
Feb. 14. Our Valentine box was full. 
March 1. Miss —— gave us a lovely plant. It is a begonia. 
March 6. John W. has been sick a long time. He came back to 
school today. 
Matter-of-fact material of this kind offers the least temp- 
tation for the imagination to soar and for ideas to run 
far ahead of the meager ability to express them in written 
form.
-P-A-G-E-177
FACTORS IN WRITTEN EXPRESSION 165 
Wrirren Work SHOULD BE SMALL IN AMOUNT AND 
VARIED IN CHARACTER 
Children should not be asked to write accounts of every- 
thing that they do or see just for the sake of extracting a 
lesson in composition out of the experience. It has been a 
common practice to require pupils to write a somewhat 
extended account of every interesting occurrence, even 
though no use was to be made of the compositions. Such 
writing is usually forced and perfunctory, and the way it 
sometimes strikes fresh young minds is shown in the follow- 
ing incident: A group of third-grade children went with their 
teacher in the spring to a lovely woodland spot to get ac- 
quainted with the wild flowers. The day was beautiful, 
quantities of flowers in great variety were found, and each 
child was permitted to gather a handful. A few plants were 
taken up by the roots for the school wild-flower garden. It 
was a very happy day for every one. Returning, the teacher 
walked for some distance behind three little girls who chat- 
tered together. Presently one of them remarked to her 
neighbor, ‘Don’t you dread to-morrow?” “Why?” said 
the second child. “‘Because,’’ was the reply, ‘““you know 
we'll have to write about this.”” They never knew that the 
teacher heard the conversation, and they must have had a 
happy surprise when the week passed and no written work 
on the subject was called for. The teacher reviewed her 
practice and realized that written exercises called for in the 
past had been too extended, too frequent, with little real 
purpose, and that they had often suffered the disadvantage 
of an anticlimax. 
To ebtain_the best results, provision “must be made for 
variet; jn written SOE The teacher in the situation just 
described had fallen into a rut. Everything was grist for 
the English mill,-and she had lost sight of the need of fresh

166 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
incentive and sincerity of purpose from the child’s stand- 
point. With a little suggestion this group could have been 
led to arrange a pretty bunch of their blossoms to put on the 
desk of Miss ——, a favorite teacher who could not go on the 
excursion. They would hayg been glad, too, to write a nice 
little note to accompany the flowers. Perhaps some of them 
would have liked to make a brief record and diagram show- 
ing just where certain of their wild-flower plants were placed 
in the garden in order to identify them with greater certainty 
the next year. They might have liked to arrange a table in 
the hall for all the school to enjoy, placing on it bowls con- 
taining specimens of their wild flowers properly labeled. A 
committee might have liked to discover and copy some selec- 
tions of verse about violets, Jack-in-the-pulpit, Bloodroot 
and Dutchman’s-breeches to place beside the appropriate 
flowers. Some of the children would certainly have done 
good work in drafting speeches to be given in Assembly or 
before another grade telling about different parts of the trip. 
The mild protest of the little girl was probably largely due 
to her unconscious rebellion against a monotonous and ap- 
parently useless task. 
Provision SHOULD BE MaprE For CREATIVE WorK 
While simple everyday affairs should form the basis for 
the larger share of the written work during primary years, 
the creative impulse should not be neglected. The desire to 
invent stories finds its best outlet at this time in oral narra- 
tion and dialogue where the more certain control over speech 
offers less hindrance to the flow of ideas. Only in excep- 
tional situations in our schools should we expect much in the 
way of original creative work in written form below ad- 
vanced fourth grade. In a schoo*where most of the pupils 
are of English-speaking parentage with a good social back- 
ground, we may look for excellent work of this sort in the
-P-A-G-E-179
FACTORS IN WRITTEN EXPRESSION 167 
third grade. But wherever it is attempted and with what- 
ever type of children, much encouragement and guidance 
will be needed by all but the most original and imaginative. 
The more opportunity the children have had from kinder- 
garten on to make up and telL-little stories of their own, the 
easier it will be for them to take the next step and begin to 
write out their stories for others to read. In this type of 
work some children will stall completely, and others will 
have a wealth of ideas far in excess of their ability to express 
them. 
Many teachers shirk any attempt to include creative work 
n the primary course in written English because it is so 
ifficult to conduct.) Each child is composing individually 
with a different-plot or scheme and with widely different 
abilities. All will need assistance in spelling and some will 
appeal for aid in sentence construction. How can help and 
guidance be giyen to thirty-five children when their needs 
are so different? Writing of this sort should rarely be at- 
tempted by one group while the teacher is engaged in teach- 
ing another class. She should be free to give her undivided 
attention to those who are writing, and she must know how 
to create an atmosphere of confidence and anticipation of 
pleasure in the results. While children are engaged in this 
sort of writing, some teachers like to sit where individual 
children can come to them for a brief conference in !ow tones. 
Others prefer to move about the room responding to raised 
hands here and there, writing needed words on pads placed 
on the desks, asking questions, offering suggestions, and act- 
ing_as general adviser. 
It is worse than useless to attempt to force the more stolid 
or literal-minded children to produce stories calling for crea- 
\tive imagination. Where the native impulse is lacking, if 
it cannot be supplied through acquaintance with fine fairy- 
tales and simple beautiful poetry, and through contagion ot 
     
 
-P-A-G-E-180
168 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
from the more gifted children, no amount of insistence will 
bring a product worthy of the energy expended. With the 
~ child as with the literary genius, it is the attitude of play, 
of delight in invention, which is essential to the creation of 
original, interesting, and beautiful forms. Let the more 
matter-of-fact children continue with their tales of pets, 
toys, and real children, while the more imaginative minds 
play with plots and scenes laid in fairyland. 
Very short stories should be encouraged, or if the tale 
must run to greater length the writer should be urged and 
helped to break it up into short chapters or episodes. One 
little six-and-a-half-year-old boy made up an amusing story 
about a mouse family. The story grew serially by short sec- 
tions from day to day, and occasionally he would bring 
to school a chapter written at home on an old typewriter. 
Here is a specimen chapter written without assistance: © 
The Cat and the Rat 
by Stewart S. 
One day the cat thought he would visit the rats 
Mr. rat said “how do you do,? I have not seen 
you for a long time”. Mrs. Rat said “how do you 
do.” then they sat down to tolk. and then mrs. rat 
whespered into Mr. rats ear that better watch Mr. 
cat woh had begun to sneff. 
Stories which children make up are more original than the 
modern fanciful tales written by adults for children. The 
latter are almost invariably a re-combination of familiar 
features of old well-known fairy-tales or they are confessed 
or self-evident imitations of such tales. Children, too, 
weave together incidents and characters from their nursery 
tales, and they build stories which resemble in some ways 
those found in their story books, but they achieve many 
unique and refreshing combinations. In these “made-up” 
stories there is an excellent opportunity to develop gradually 
  ee
-P-A-G-E-181
  FACTORS IN WRITTEN EXPRESSION 169 
a consciousness of form or pattern and a sense of what is 
pleasing and satisfying in plot and incident. 
The following story was written in school by a third-grade 
child. It shows that the little girl had a well-developed 
sense of organization. In type, it is like the explanatory 
myth so common in the folklore of all races, which attempts 
to reveal the why and wherefore of some natural phenome- 
non. In this respect it is an imitation, but it possesses also 
distinctly original features, and is a good example of how 
imagination may be led away from formless wandering into 
a charming pattern. 
Mr. Tee Whiskers and the Fairies. 
Mr. Tee Whiskers was eating bread in 
the pantry when he heard a noise. 
He squeeled “that must be Susan with 
the trap. I must hurry away. Oh where 
shall I go.” Oh! I know I shall go to 
Fairyland. 
“Tl pack my bag 
and hurry away 
For fear a cat 
Will come some day.” 
He started out and met his friend Mr. 
Duck. “How-do-you”. Mr. Duck, where are you 
bound this fine summer day.” 
I am bound for Fairyland,” quacked Mr. 
Duck. Why! are you going to Fairyland 
too? ‘That is where I am going. 
“Tf that is so I will take you on my back” 
exclaimed Mr Duck 
So Mr. Tee Wiskers jumped on his back 
and rode down the river. 
So when he arrived at Fairyland 
he saw the pretty little fairies 
dancing among the water lilies 
in the moonlight. 
“Hello!” cried the fairies to Mr 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
170 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Duck and Mr Tee Whiskers, 
“have you come to see us? 
Yes! replied the mouse “I have come 
to live with you? 
“All right,” answered the Fairies, 
but you might drown.” 
“Cant you make me so I can fly 
over the water.” 
““Indeed”’ said the queen of the 
Fairies “I'll change you into a bat. 
“Thank you thank you” laughed 
Mr Mouse. So the fairy queen 
waved her wand and said 
“Be a bat 
My little rat 
and I shall give you a hat. 
So Mr. Tee Whiskers took on his 
wings and flew out into the 
night. This is why we have 
bats flying at night. 
It is a good thing occasionally to have the whole class 
codperate with the teacher in the construction of a fanciful 
tale according to some clear-cut plan of organization. The 
teacher may suggest a good story pattern, children will con- 
tribute incidents and appropriate details, and individuals 
may write certain definite parts of the whole. The following 
account of how a composite story of this kind was written is 
taken from Training School News, Valdosta, Georgia.! Miss 
Myrla Morris was the teacher in charge: 
THE RED CROSS IN TOYLAND 
One of our story-books tells us that a fairy with a golden wand 
comes to the playroom at twilight, setting the toys free to talk and 
play together as real children do. 
The Second Grade has used this idea in making up the following

December, 1919.

story of how the Red Cross was organized in Toyland. It was 
modeled after one of their Primer stories of last year and was 
written for the First Grade to read and dramatize. Each child 
wrote a part of the story, the best being selected and put together 
in the complete story.

“Good morning,” he said, “where are you going today?” 
“T am going to join the Red Cross.” 
“May I go too,” asked the Toy Dog. 
“What can you do?”

The Tin Soldier said, “where are you going today?” 
The Little Doll said, “I am going to join the Red Cross.”

“What can you do?” 
“T can march in the parade.”

5. By and by she came to the Toy Drum. 
“Good morning, Little Doll,” said the Toy Drum. 
“Where are you going today?” 
“T am going to join the Red Cross,” said the Little Doll. 
“May I go too?” said the Drum. 
“What can you do?” asked the Doll. 
“T can beat for the soldiers to march in the parade,” said 
the Drum. 
“Come along,” said the Doll.

6. By and by they met a flag. 
The Flag said, “Good morning, Little Doll.’’ “‘Where 
are you going today?” 
“T am going to join the Red Cross.™ 
“May I go too?” said the flag. 
“What can you do?” 
“T can wave in the parade,” said the flag.

ie They met the Toy Cat. [A toy bank] 
““Where are you going?” 
“T am going to join the Red Cross.” 
“May I go too,” asked the Toy Cat. 
“*What can you do?” 
“T can save the money,” said the cat. 
“Come along.” 
(Mary Hagan) 
8. So they walked and walked till they met all the girl dolls. 
They said, “Where are you going?” 
The Little Doll said, “I am going to join the Red Cross.” 
“May I go too?”’ said all the little girl dolls. 
The little Girl Dolls said, ‘“We can knit and sew.” 
“Come along,” said Little Doll. 
(Johnsie E.) 
9. Then she went on until she came to all the Boy Dolls. 
“Good morning, Little Doll, where are you going?” 
“T am going to join the Red Cross.”

“Let us go, too,” the Boy Dolls asked. 
“What can you do?” 
“We can work and save.” 
So she said, ““Come along.” 
(Lloyd J.) 
10. ‘Then they all joined the Red Cross and had a parade. 
The drum began to beat; 
The soldiers began to march; 
The flag began to wave; 
The dolls began to march. 
All the toys in Toyland marched in the parade. 
(Sara Jones) 
Every year adult writers produce and publish quantities 
of stories for children patterned after the old accumulative 
tale, and many of them fall far below this one in interest and 
charm. Probably the fact that ‘“‘The Red Cross in Toy- 
land” was written expressly for the first grade and intended 
for them to read and dramatize, served to stimulate and 
direct, in a measure, the efforts of the writers. Through 
such a piece of work there is every opportunity to give ex- 
cellent training in ordered thinking. The little tale repre- 
sents a high type of rational, organized thought within the 
realm of playful fancy. 
Another type of original production which many children 
greatly enjoy is the rhyme or stanza of “poetry,” and almost 
all can be led to make some attempt at it. It is a common 
observation that most children pass through a period of play 
with words when they make up more or less meaningless 
jingles and appear to get great satisfaction from chanting 
them. Mere rhyme and measure, and delight in invention 
seem to form the basis of their pleasure. Many kinder- 
garten and first-grade teachers recognize the value of this 
tendency and utilize it long before the children are able to 
write. They are encouraged to make up rhymed couplets,  
-P-A-G-E-186
174 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
and to recite them. The best are written down by the 
teacher with the author’s name attached, and sometimes a 
good little tune is found for them. Often this activity is 
initiated by seizing upon some very silly, annoying reitera- 
tion of a doggerel strain which one child perpetrates and by 
helping him to improve it so that it possesses some degree of 
fun or sense. Here are a few rhymes that. have been dic- 
tated by young children: 
Ting-a-ling-a-lee 
Won’t you come to tea. 
The table is set 
Now what shall we get? 
Come and see my pretty boat. 
Come and see how it will float. 
See my dolly in her chair. 
See her pretty yellow hair. 
This is Mary Ellen Cram [a doll] 
In her pretty yellow tam. 
Occasionally we meet a child who has a real talent for this 
sort of thing, but most children have only a rudimentary 
sense which makes them halt and fumble in their inventions. 
Some definite help from the teacher will in most cases be 
needed in the beginning, and it is time well spent both from 
the standpoint of language development and of the delight 
which most children take in the exercise. 
There is little doubt that beyond the couplet, or possibly 
the quatrain, the necessity to find rhymes becomes a real 
hindrance to the expression of thought and mood. Many 
gifted adult poets have broken away from the limitations 
and strictures which rhyme and exact regularity lay upon 
them and are expressing themselves through free verse of
-P-A-G-E-187
    FACTORS IN WRITTEN EXPRESSION 175 
different kinds. How much more restricting must the re- 
quirements of rhyme be to children possessed of no real 
talent. Their verses are bound to be commonplace. Yet 
many children are at times natural poets in thought and 
feeling. The poems of Hilda Conkling ' have been a revela- 
tion to all who have read them. Only a very few are in 
rhyme. Cadence, beautiful imagery, the fitting word, and 
fresh poetic concepts characterize the verse of this remark- 
able little girl. Such child genius is of course exceedingly 
rare, but possibly, if we had not hampered children by lead- 
ing them to think that verse must always be rhyme, we 
might have opened the door of lovely cadenced expression to 
some of our pupils. It is worth the effort at least, as is 
shown by the following selections written by pupils in a 
public school in New York City.?. In order to show the 
work of younger children we quote here only those written 
by pupils in the third and fourth grades. 
The Bird. 
Tam a bird. 
I fly away and sing. 
When I am tired I come home to my nest. 
I go to sleep with my head under my 
wing. 
When I wake, I fly away again and sing:

Other verses in this booklet by older children show how, 
in a city environment, boys and girls, many of them from 
non-English-speaking homes, find beauty, charm, and some- 
times mystery, in commonplace, restricted surroundings. 
We notice such subjects as The Street Cleaner, Night, The 
School Garden, Day Begins, Flying Kites, The Sun-Dial, 
Sliding Pond. There are touches of true poetry in almost all
-P-A-G-E-189
FACTORS IN WRITTEN EXPRESSION 177 
of them produced by cadence, a happy turn or phrase, or a 
beautiful concept, but in very few of them is rhyme em- 
ployed to any great extent. 
If a song in rhymed verse is to be attempted for some 
special occasion such as Christmas, May Day, or some one’s 
birthday, it is usually advisable to enlist the pupils in a co- 
operative effort. The occasion will be discussed, appropriate 
ideas will be suggested, some one will offer an initial thought, 
perhaps the teacher will produce a beginning couplet and a 
clever child may follow with another. Thus, by pooling ideas 
and skill and by free and friendly criticism, a result may be 
obtained in which many if not all of the class have had 
a part. The satisfaction which comes from achievement 
serves also to stimulate to further effort along the same line. 
WRITING SHOULD NEVER BE ASSIGNED SIMPLY TO KEEP 
CuILpREN Busy AND QuIET 
As soon as handwriting is mastered, there is a temptation 
in our overcrowded schools to impose written tasks at in- 
tervals throughout the day because the work is noiseless and 
calls for a certain amount of concentration. Copying and 
the reproduction of familiar stories have been two great 
stand-bys of busy teachers who are lacking in resource. It 
is so easy to say, ‘Open your Readers at page so-and-so and 
make a neat copy. Be sure to notice all capitals and punc- 
tuation marks.” A quiet half-hour to teach another class is 
thus secured, since there is no occasion for even a question 
from the little copyists. Having children reproduce in writ- 
ing some familiar story serves almost equally well as a relief 
from active teaching, though it takes a little longer to launch 
the exercise. A brief discussion of the story is usually al- 
lowed, and some difficult words that are sure to be needed 
are written on the blackboard before the signal to begin is 
given. So employed, both of these exercises are practically 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
178 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
worthless. We noticed earlier in this chapter that adults 
quite commonly omit altogether these two purposes for 
writing from their lists made up from daily custom and use, 
or they relegate them to an unimportant place. In school- 
life, children have more real need for copying, but it is not of 
the sort described above. In support of such a routine exer- 
cise it has been claimed that capitalization, punctuation, 
indentation, ete., can be taught through copying. There is 
nothing in the known laws of psychology to support such a 
view. Children might copy page upon page of print and 
never have consciousness sufficiently aroused to give a 
single thought as to why a capital is used here or a period 
there. One can copy correctly with entire abstraction of 
mind just as one can “read” a page and not be conscious 
of a single thought contained thereon. Furthermore, what 
ground have we to assume that a child will think about why 
a capital is used any more than he will think about why 
there are two ?’s in little? In copying, both of these opera- 
tions are apt to be purely automatic, yet one does not de- 
pend on such work to establish the habit of putting two ?’s in 
little. Where there is such variability as prevails in capitali- 
zation and punctuation, there can be no growth in ability 
to apply the principles involved unless discrimination and 
judgment are frequently called for. 
Some value probably attaches to such operations as copy- 
ing a favorite song into an individual song book, a good joke 
into the joke book, transcribing a set of rules elaborated by 
the class, or the directions for making something. Producing, 
in duplicate, invitations for some special occasion, or programs 
for an entertainment, after models have been formulated, 
constitute purposeful uses for copying. Such work is not so 
apt to be done in a mechanical way, since there are personal 
objectives in view which would be partially defeated by 
thoughtless work, and since in several of the instances men- 
tioned the pupils have themselves evolved the original copy.

FACTORS IN WRITTEN EXPRESSION 179 
Reproducing a story in written form is not such a me- 
chanical operation as copying, but, compared with the train- 
ing which comes in the process of preparing and giving a 
good oral reproduction, it ranks very low in educative value. 
If the story is a fine one, ‘it Will be mangled and utterly 
spoiled in the inefficient hands of primary children, and if it is 
cheap and commonplace to start with, why spend time and 
energy in an attempt to reproduce it? The most valid reason 
for written reproduction is the preservation of some very short 
delightful story or anecdote not found in their own books. 
Recasting local legends, bits of history, or fragments of 
myth comes under a different category, and is not open to 
the same objections as the crude rewriting of a choice piece 
of literature. Such material will bear rougher handling be- 
cause it has never taken on a finished art form. Literature 
has in the past been made to carry far too much of the load 
represented by necessary practice and drill in written com- 
position, and many textbooks are modeled in a fashion 
which encourages this tendency. 
Wuat Piacr sHouLp TEXTBOOKS HAVE IN THE TEACHING 
or Written EnctisH IN Primary Grapes? 
There are comparatively few texts in English Composition 
intended to be placed in the hands of second-grade children. 
In the great majority of cases the first book of a series or the 
first part of Book I is intended for use in the fourth grade. 
This indicates either tacit assent to the position that the 
textbook has little place in early primary grades or that the 
experts so far have seldom had the courage to attempt to 
meet the need. With a few exceptions the textbooks which 
seem to embody the soundest pedagogical principles in other 
respects are designed to be used by children at about the 
fourth grade. This would seem to indicate that the most 
competent specialists believe that such texts are not very
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
serviceable with less mature pupils. Handling and inter- 
preting a text adds one more element to an activity that is 
already complex and has a tendency to check still further 
the spontaneous expression of beginners. It is exceedingly 
difficult to follow a textbook closely and still make use of all 
the small personal and immediate occasions for written ex- 
pression. Asa result, textbook topics and methods if used 
too early tend to establish a stiff, self-conscious, and formal 
attitude toward writing. 
There are situations, however, when the best of the mod- 
ern books might be of real service as low as the third grade, 
particularly if kept in subordination to the more vital inter- 
ests of the group. In rural schools where the teacher has an 
unusually large number of classes or in city schools where the 
classes are very large, an attractive book with pleasing pic- 
tures, interesting subject-matter, and suggestions suited to 
childish tastes and aptitudes might be a real asset at this 
stage. 
Where such textbooks are not used by the pupils, teachers 
should have in their possession several of the best, for they 
furnish excellent suggestion and guidance. The less com- 
petent and original teachers need such help to supplement 
their own ideas and methods and the more resourceful should 
be partially guided by good texts in order to insure that the 
formal phases of English are adequately covered at certain 
stages. 
As suggested above, one great weakness of many begin- 
ning textbooks in English is their extensive reliance upon 
literature as subject-matter for both oral and written com- 
position. Judging by their content one might suppose that 
almost the sole interest of children was in stories and poems. 
A close examination of several popular textbooks shows as 
high as eighty per cent of all exercises based upon literature 
with very little use of children’s active daily life and practi-
-P-A-G-E-193
  FACTORS IN WRITTEN EXPRESSION 181 
cal affairs as subject-matter. This must be due to the ease 
with which literature can be handled in a book and not to 
any well-founded estimate of its relative importance in the 
verbal expression of either adults or children. 
This overemphasis is partly responsible for another de- 
fect, the scant attention paid to the genuine application of 
what is taught. Comparatively few books make any at- 
tempt to point out to pupils interesting ways in which they 
may make use of the points presented. Ground has been 
broken in this direction, however, and a few of the newer 
textbooks offer hints and suggestions showing how some of 
the exercises may be adapted, imitated, or directly applied 
to some situation of real importance to a particular group. 
Teachers and children are made to feel that the main pur- 
pose of the textbook is to point out interesting things to be 
done, to show some good ways of doing these things, and to 
stir the class to discover or create other situations more ap- 
pealing tothem. The dramatized story, assembly program, 
model letters, descriptions of pictures, games, and other ex- 
periences are presented as a direct challenge to pupils to pro- 
duce something similar but of more immediate significance 
and use to them. ;

  CHAPTER X 
THE INFORMAL APPROACH TO WRITING 
Exactinc and minutely detailed systems of teaching pen- 
manship constitute a pernicious interference with the natu- 
ral development of self-expression through writing and with 
the normal development of handwriting itself. In schools 
making any claim to a recognition of modern psychology 
there is not another skill or subject that is permitted to take 
such an isolated and domineering course as is penmanship. 
In many places months and even years must be spent in 
acquiring a certain degree of mastery over the technique of 
movement before teachers dare permit or encourage their 
pupils to use writing as a genuine means of expression. It is 
quite common to spend nearly all the time that can be de- 
voted to writing for the first two years in muscular move- 
ment exercises and other related features of technique. It 
is further urged that for another year or two such exercises 
should predominate over any freer, more purposeful use of 
handwriting. In a great many of our schools children six 
years of age and even younger are being subjected daily to 
wearisome, meaningless drill in a technique requiring very 
fine codrdinations and a high degree of concentration for 
which they are in no way equipped. 
What are the arguments used in support of such pro- 
cedure? They are the stock arguments that have been used 
at one time or another in defense of an over-systematized 
and logical approach to almost every subject in the curricu- 
lum. It is said that in a manual art such as writing, the 
establishment of right muscular habits is of paramount im- 
portance; that these habits form a hierarchy or a codrdinated 
system in which certain basic ones must be established first,
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE INFORMAL APPROACH TO WRITING 183 
followed by others until all are integrated into a unitary 
habit; that the attempt to use the skill in a rudimentary 
state interferes with the system; and that getting mastery of 
the instrument as a mechanism during the early years when 
there is not much use for it is a measure of economy. Fur- 
thermore, it is ‘claimed that, because handwriting is such a 
very complex skill made up of many small habits, it is par- 
ticularly disastrous to deviate from the logical order of some 
elaborated scheme. This same theory held for many years 
in the matter of teaching children to play on the piano, but 
it was discarded in that field long ago. Yet the art of piano- 
playing is certainly more complex than handwriting. The 
unitary skill is composed of a much larger number of minor 
habits which must be bound together with certainty and 
precision. But there is not a teacher of the piano to-day 
with any professional standing who would start young chil- 
dren with scales and finger exercises and keep them on these 
for a year or two before allowing them to play little tunes. 
Successful modern piano teachers do not attempt to build up 
a fine technique and thus introduce the execution of mel- 
odies. They start at once with very simple melodies and 
harmonies and develop technique gradually in and through 
the process of “playing the piano.” 
In the teaching of handwriting we have something to learn 
from the successful teachers of instrumental music. We 
have been too easily impressed and dominated by penman- 
ship experts who do not know very much about child psy- 
chology. There is no evidence of weight to support the 
theory that a particular sort of “muscular movement” is 
basic and essential in the early stages of writing. On the 
contrary, there is much reason to believe that such drill 
forms a poor approach to the art. There are scientific 
studies and experiments which indicate rather clearly the 
wisdom of deferring and subordinating such exercises.
-P-A-G-E-196
184 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Professor Frank N. Freeman ! has reviewed very thor- 
oughly all the leading “statistical, historical, and observa- 
tional evidence” regarding the efficiency of different meth- 
ods of teaching handwriting and he has arrived at certain 
conclusions based on this evidence. The following passages 
give a partial summary of these views as they bear upon the 
question under discussion: 
Exacting formal drill should not be given before about Grade 
IV. The greater part of the practice throughout the grades should 
be given to actual writing of words. Insistence upon position or 
type of movement should first become strict about Grade IV. 
During the primary grades only the gross faults should be cor- 
rected. . .. Growth in skill of movement is marked at about the 
ninth year. Few pupils who are given arm-movement drill can use 
the arm movement before the fourth grade. 
The speed of writing should be low at the beginning and should 
gradually increase from about 30 letters per minute at the end of 
Grade ITI to about 73 letters per minute at the end of Grade VIII. 
... Young children are incapable of making new coérdinate move- 
ments rapidly. 
The standard of accuracy should be low at the beginning and 
should gradually increase as the child gains in maturity and prac- 
tice. Letters should be large at the beginning because large letters 
do not need to be so accurate as small letters. ...The steadiness 
and accuracy of movement increases greatly with maturity. 
The bibliography which accompanies Dr. Freeman’s 
article contains the titles of numerous published reports of 
experiments and investigations which have furnished ample 
data for the deduction of the principles just quoted. 
Two facts which seem to offer the best guidance to a policy 
in primary work may be stated as follows: 
First, young children are distinctly lacking in motor 
1 Freeman, Frank N.: “Principles of Method in Teaching Writing as 
Derived from Scientific Investigations,” chap. 1, Eighteenth Yearbook, 
N.S.S.E. Public School Publishing Company, Bloomington, Illinois, 1919.
-P-A-G-E-197
  THE INFORMAL APPROACH TO WRITING 185 
ability, but this ability increases rapidly between the ages 
of seven and ten years. 
Second, modern psychology indicates that it is desirable 
to keep any developing skill closely connected with its use or 
application, especially when the learner is immature. 
Tn picking out “‘muscular movement” and a highly organ- 
ized technique for early and insistent emphasis, specialists 
have selected the element in writing which more than any 
other calls for a high degree of motor ability. It is also the 
element which has least meaning and significance to begin- 
ners, and which, if stressed, causes the long postponement of 
any real application of the art of writing to childish affairs. 
If Dr. Freeman is right in his conclusion that a speed of 
thirty letters per minute is satisfactory for second-grade 
pupils at the end of the year, then there is no need for anx- 
ious pressure in the matter of muscular movement. If the 
reader will select a sentence or phrase containing thirty let- 
ters and then, with watch before him, will try to write it 
slowly enough to occupy one minute in the operation, he will 
realize how moderate the rate is. This rate gives the child 
plenty of time to form his letters nicely, to make connections 
carefully, to space properly, and to get a good alignment. 
All of these elements are probably of greater importance in 
the early stages than is either greater speed or a particular 
type of muscular movement. 
In acquiring a skill so complex as writing, it is of course 
impossible to attain mastery over all of the various elements 
at once. Learning how to form the script letters well and 
how to connect them properly as they occur in words is per- 
haps the most fundamental element and the one through 
which an immediate appeal can best be made to children. 
The whole word is the smallest unit of thought, and some 
significant word should be the starting-point for teaching 
children to write. The child’s name may be the first word 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
186 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
taught provided it runs more toward the dimensions of Tom 
or Anne than of Christopher or Gwendolyn. If the whole 
name is much too difficult, begin with the initials. There is 
an advantage, of course, in beginning with some word or 
words which may interest a larger group. Something even 
easier than the phrases suggested on page 157 may be used 
at first. Single words to be put on a big chart in connection 
with a health campaign, for example, may be practiced on 
the blackboard. If the value of milk is under consideration, 
such words as cow, milk, milkman, milk-train, butter, may be 
taught and afterwards written by individual children on big 
sheets of paper with suitable illustrations cut from maga- 
zines and papers. A large scrapbook may serve to encourage 
practice in writing. Cut-out pictures may be grouped so that 
similar objects are on a given page. The children may then 
practice on the blackboard until they learn how to write such 
titles as cats, kittens, big dogs, little dogs, trees, trains, dolls, 
toys, little boys at play, litile girls at play, little boys at work, 
little girls at work, etc., after which the appropriate word or 
phrase may be written on large sheets facing the pictures. 
Another line of thought which calls for very simple, easy 
expression is found in making a list for blackboard or chart 
under the heading ‘‘ What children do to make them grow.” 
The heading is written or printed by the teacher, and the 
pupils learn to write such words as run, play, work, rest, eat, 
sleep, etc. A fuller content bearing on the importance of 
fresh air, the right sort of food, and good physical habits 
should, of course, be developed through conversation and 
pictures; and the latter should be mounted on the chart to 
make more complete the meaning of single words written by 
the children. 
An attempt will be made to describe the steps in a flexible 
method of teaching beginners to write which has been em- 
ployed successfully by many primary teachers where an
-P-A-G-E-199
THE INFORMAL APPROACH TO WRITING _ 187 
exacting formal system is not imposed. Take, for example, 
the making of such a chart as the one last mentioned. We 
will assume that all the preliminary steps have been taken 
leading to the execution of the plan and that the children are 
ready to learn how to write a few words partially expressive 
of a definite idea. A group is before the blackboard, and the 
teacher writes rather slowly and carefully the word run. 
“Would some one like to try?” A volunteer is chosen. 
“Look at the word. Iam going to erase it and write it again 
before you try.””. The teacher erases the word and writes it 
again. Again she erases, and the child chosen comes to the 
board and attempts to do just what the teacher did. If this 
is begun in advanced first or second grade, the majority of 
children in an average class will be able to imitate very soon 
both in form and movement easy words which they see the 
teacher write. And notice that this is done without a copy 
before them. Much greater freedom and fluency are ob- 
tained where children learn to write from the visual image of 
both form and movement which they carry in mind and 
execute as a unit. The kinesthetic image of the complete 
movement required to write a word is much more quickly 
and surely imprinted by this process than by the disjointed, 
fragmentary copying of a word letter by letter or stroke by 
stroke with the model before the eyes. 
Stop practice on a word before the children are weary, and 
if necessary come back to it again. At this early stage, 
allow only the most skillful pupils to attempt the final copy 
on a big sheet of paper for the chart, because change to paper 
and pencil tends to stiffen the whole process. 
Large blackboard space which one is not afraid to use is 
requisite in this method. The fetish which demands a 
beautiful, clean, decorated blackboard, with nothing appear- 
ing on it except the teacher’s very best script, print, or 
drawing, must be given up.
-P-A-G-E-200
  188 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
It is necessary in the beginning to break up longer and 
more difficult words into syllables, as children cannot be ex- 
pected to get the complete image of form and movement; 
but the whole word, as, butter, should be presented, and then 
the syllables but and ter should be practiced separately and 
united again as soon as possible. Often it is necessary to 
practice making single letters or certain letters in conjunc- 
tion where the connection is peculiar, but these smaller units 
are taught in the same way. They are singled out because 
they offer special difficulty, are written by the teacher, 
erased, and imitated by the children without a copy. From 
the beginning the teacher helps to analyze the movement 
while preserving its integrity. She may say, “See how my 
chalk goes around and then back, to make this a.” “‘See 
how I dip down a little from my b before I try to make the 
u.” “Watch how I join this 0 to the'd.” She does not 
hesitate to name the letters when occasion demands or to 
have the pupils name them, and this kind of writing is an 
excellent beginning of.conscious spelling. A well-codrdinated 
movement in writing cannot be developed faster than the 
ability to spell, for the moment one hesitates about the spell- 
ing of a word rhythmic movement of course falters and stops. 
Tn the early stages this control is specific and is secured only 
through increasing fluency in writing known words. 
There is nothing original in this method so far as the 
present writer is concerned. In all essential features it was 
in use in the old Cook County Normal School during the 
régime of Colonel Francis Parker and has been widely used 
wherever that influence spread. 
Supplementary exercises, such as those suggested by 
Gesell,! are probably of assistance to children whose co- 
ordinations are especially weak, and may be of some value to 
all beginners. The tendency to use small, cramped writing 
1 Gesell, A. L. and B, C.: The Normal Child and Primary Education.
-P-A-G-E-201
    THE INFORMAL APPROACH TO WRITING 189 
is very rarely manifested in blackboard work introduced 
according to the plan indicated above. When paper and 
pencil are adopted later, pupils would not be expected to use 
the muscular or arm movement to any great extent until 
about fourth grade at which time intensive training in short 
periods would be begun. In the mean time finger movement 
will be permitted for two reasons — first, because it is a 
legitimate element in any perfected mode of writing, and, 
second, because we could not prevent it if we would. The 
only way that finger movement could be eliminated in child- 
hood would be to confiscate all pencils in the world outside 
of school or put the family and the public on oath not to let 
a child touch one. How can any one suppose that practice 
of fifteen or twenty minutes a day in school will counteract 
all the hours which most children spend in spontaneous un- 
supervised use of pencil and crayon? If a very moderate 
amount of writing is called for in primary grades, and if 
careful supervision is given to what is done, habits involving 
incorrect position and muscular tension need not become 
fixed. 
Manuscrirt WritInG 
A form of handwriting called ‘manuscript writing” has 
recently been introduced into this country from England 
where it has been very widely adopted. The method is too 
new and the data obtainable are insufficient as yet to form a 
basis for reliable judgments regarding such features as speed, 
rhythmic movement, and fatigue. Close observers are 
much impressed, however, with the legibility and beauty of 
this writing and the ease with which it is acquired. 
It is not our intention to discuss here either the history or 
the specific character of this kind of writing. It is being 
introduced experimentally into a number of schools and 
before long reliable data will be available. The method has
-P-A-G-E-202

been regularly taught for several years in the Brearley School, 
New York. In 1922 Miss Marjorie Wise came to Teachers 
College from England 
- where she had taught this

of years. She was invited 
tomake some experiments 
in the Lincoln School and

is now available. It was prepared by Miss Wise ? and is 
intended as a guide for teachers. She is also the author of a 
helpful article on the subject published in the Teachers Col- 
lege Record.* 
One noticeable advantage of this approach to writing is 
that children can really use it very early in connection with 
affairs that are important to them and they can readily 
secure very good effects. Another point in its favor is that, 
even though another form of writing should be deemed bet- 
ter for general use later, there will always be a place for this 
kind in connection with the preparation of labels, captions, 
programs, posters, etc., where ordinary script is unsuitable, 
inartistic, and often not very legible. 
QUESTIONS 
1. Are there valid grounds for accepting a strictly logical order 
in teaching handwriting when such approach has been re- 
jected in other subjects? 
2. Try the following experiment with a child of about six years 
who has not been taught to write. Write an easy word on the 
blackboard and direct him to copy it in a space below your 
model. _ Using another easy word follow the method de- 
scribed in this chapter in which the copy is erased. In the 
latter case be sure to write rather slowly and let the child see 
every stroke you make. Notice especially the differences in 
movement employed by the child in the two methods. 
8. From infancy there are many things which seem to stimulate 
children to print. Might it be a good thing to encourage this 
strong impulse toward printing instead of insisting on the 
more difficult cursive writing? What arguments against this 
practice are certain to be raised?

  CHAPTER XI 
HOW TO JUDGE OF MATERIALS AND METHODS PROPOSED 
FOR TEACHING BEGINNING READING 
Tue question to be discussed couples together the reading 
matter intended for beginners and methods to be employed 
because the two are in practice inseparable and mutually 
restrictive. Too often a method of teaching reading is 
evolved, textbooks are written which are calculated to carry 
out the method, the method is elaborated and explained in a 
manual, and teachers are solemnly warned of the sad con- 
sequences of departing from the course therein prescribed. 
Even when authors are not so insistent regarding the 
dangers of using their books in any but the orthodox fashion, 
a glance at the first books in a series will often reveal the fact 
that everything is subordinated to a particular teaching 
method. Primer, first reader, and sometimes the second 
reader in the more mechanical systems, show that they are 
mere cogs in a big machine. One can readily see that they 
are designed to present a mass of printed matter for a special 
kind of practice. It is inane, disjointed, uninteresting, and 
often not very intelligible. \ A normal four-year-old in a 
family of fair education is intellectually far beyond the con- 
tent of such books. 
Should reading matter for beginners be thus entirely sub- 
ordinated to some mechanical system or should it be judged 
and selected in somewhat the same manner as any real 
child’s book — on its own merits. from the standpoint of the 
taste of the owner? Not many years ago this would have 
been an impossible standard, for the reason that no textbook 
could have been found which would measure up to the re- 
quirement. But it is not too high a standard to-day even 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
164 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
for the primer. There are a number of primers and first 
readers which, considering the price, will bear comparison 
with choice gift-books. Several of these newer textbooks, 
viewed simply from the pleasure-giving side, are far superior 
to the cheaper picture-story-books which flood the shops at 
Christmas. Can any procedure be considered good which 
deliberately limits children and teachers to poor, silly, badly 
organized material for school purposes and precludes the use 
of the sort of books to which children eagerly respond? 
Surely that procedure is best which not only utilizes but 
requires, for successful operation, a superior type of reading 
matter — superior from the standpoint of the literary, in- 
formational, and esthetic values which appeal to childish 
taste and interests. 
Not only does a rigid and narrow system of teaching read- 
ing employ thin, disjointed material in the beginning; it also 
stands for a negation of most of the spontaneous and inde- 
pendent effort of young pupils and of all individual variation 
in procedure. With perfection of detail and self-assurance 
which leave little for the individual teacher or child to con- 
tribute, this wordy, attenuated material is dealt out in por- 
tions measured by days, and through much drill of one kind 
or another, determined by the nature of the method, little 
pupils are carried along a straight and narrow path. 
It has been remarked often that children who learn to read & 
at home, as the result of their own desire, do so largely 
through spontaneous effort and by the use of a variety of 
means. Very often they begin with the alphabet. The 
letter-forms in picture-alphabet books, on blocks, and 
wooden cut-outs interest them, and they take the step that 
comes first in every new experience — ask the name of the 
novel object. They spell out words in newspapers, on 
magazine covers, in signs, labels, and story books, and ask 
some one to pronounce them. Frequently they follow with
-P-A-G-E-207
    TEACHING BEGINNING READING 195 
their eyes the printed page as favorite stories and poems are 
read aloud to them, noting where certain prominent and oft- 
repeated words occur. They notice, also, what is printed 
under pictures, and where the page is turned. Gradually 
these selections are unconsciously memorized, and certain 
words are singled out so often that at last they come to be 
recognized wherever seen. Many children are keen enough 
to pierce through the vagaries of the English language with 
only slight assistance. They evidently build up for them- 
selves a working basis of phonetics by making numerous as- 
sociations between words that look alike and sound alike. 
To be sure, this type of learning is exceptional, but we should 
remember also that the learner has been given exceptional 
opportunities. We have no means of knowing how many 
other children might pass, almost unconsciously, into the art 
of reading, if they were surrounded by the right stimuli and 
freed from subjection to rigidly prescribed and rigidly ap- 
plied methods, which leave no place or scope for their own 
native out-reachings and responses. 
So widespread is the idea that there must be some one way 
better than any other for introducing children to the tech- 
nique of reading that many parents are afraid to respond to 
children’s inquiries along this line, before they start to school 
or after, for fear of confusing them. Names of the letters of 
the alphabet are taboo, for they have been told that to learn 
the letter name will interfere with learning the sound for 
which the letter stands. Children must never be allowed to 
print, especially in capitals, for this causes an undue analysis 
of the word into letters. Calling the letters in a word (or 
spelling) and asking what the word is, likewise endangers - 
sound foundational work according to certain authorities. 
And according to those who ardently espouse the whole- 
thought or sentence method the tendency of children to pick 
out single words should be discouraged. The advocates of a

system predominantly phonetic feel that any effort of the 
child directed along other lines in the early stages is waste- 
ful if not positively harmful, and therefore carefully to be 
guarded against. 
Thus, one avenue after another which children have found 
useful in teaching themselves to read is blocked successfully 
in school, supposedly in the interests of economy; for, of 
course, if parents have been warned regarding the danger of 
such irregularities, the school will not offend by permitting 
them. ‘Teachers in different places or under different ré- 
gimes are told that they must print or must not print on 
the board; that they must write or must not write; that they 
must or must not both write and print at a certain stage. 
They are warned never to allow a child to encounter a word 
in reading which has not been previously taught, never to 
teach a new word by sight if it is capable of phonetic analy- 
sis or synthesis, never to permit a child to determine a word 
by spelling it, never to tell him a word or always to tell him a 
word which he does not know when reading aloud — and so 
on, with a score of other restrictions and prescriptions. Re- 
cently, a supervisor, visiting the room of a newly appointed 
first-grade teacher, glanced about and then inquired 
sternly, ““Who gave you permission to write on the black- 
board?” The teacher had been a proved success elsewhere, 
but she was either unfamiliar with a few of the details of the 
particular scheme of beginning reading required in this 
school system, or she dared to think them unimportant. 
It is evident that such conflicting ideas regarding teaching 
beginners to read cannot all be equally sound and good.

fessional demonstrators are ready to show how much may be 
taught a group of children in twenty minutes by one system 
or another. But these are only individual and often biased 
opinions. The fact is that data so far secured by the use of 
standardized tests and scales offer very small basis for such 
judgments. Surveys tell us how much higher on a certain 
reading scale the attainments of school D rank than those of 
school E, also by what fraction of a degree city system A is 
inferior to system B, but as yet the specific factors which 
have produced these measurable results have been only 
vaguely discriminated. Very valuable evidence on this 
question might be obtained through the use of available ob- 
jective standards if they could be extensively applied in 
schools or systems of schools which have followed consist- 
ently for several years radically different procedures in 
teaching reading, and if at the same time all other factors 
were fully known, but such studies have not been made. 
* One must also ask, “What is meant by results?” For 
those who claim certain superior products of a given method 
do not as a rule have in mind the definite though Wis 
values which can be measured in first- and second-grade 
standardized scales. 
Still less frequently have the various claimants any real 
proof that their pupils exhibit greater advancement than 
others in abilities and attitudes for which we have no ob- 
jective measures, such as love of reading, making good 
choices in reading, knowing how to study reading, intelligent 
use of books, wider range and deeper appreciation of what 
is read. On the other hand, if measurement of these less 
tangible but highly important values were possible, might it 
not be shown that many children have been rendered in- 
different to reading or made to hate it, through the pro- 
tracted use of clumsy, unpsychological methods reputed to 
be highly successful?

198 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Speaking of the results of his own searching investigation 
of fundamental reading habits, Buswell says: ! 
While it is evident, from the flexible adjustments which pupils 
are able to make, that more than one method of teaching reading 
may succeed equally well in developing mature reading habits, one 
would not expect to find a large number of equally good methods. 
Certainly there can be no doubt that some methods are inferior and 
uneconomical. In the light of present school experience no one 
would attempt to justify the practice of using the alphabetic 
method of teaching reading, although pupils trained in this manner 
will eventually learn to read. As has been stated, the present in- 
vestigation does not yield the type of data necessary for a judg- 
ment of methods, and consequently no attempt has been made to 
evaluate them. It should not be inferred from this that the psy- 
chologist is not interested in methods. The problem of determin- 
ing which methods are superior and which are inferior is large and 
significant. It cannot be solved except by following particular 
groups of pupils through the different stages of growth toward 
maturity. Its solution will require the combined efforts of the 
teacher and the psychologist, the teacher trying out the various 
combinations of methods in the classroom under carefully con- 
trolled conditions, while the psychologist furnishes the scientific 
analysis of results which will show the degree of progress which has 
been made in each of the fundamental elements of reading. 
At the present stage the claim of demonstrated results is 
not sufficient justification for a given teaching process in 
beginning reading, because — 
(1) Claimants usually speak without reference to definite 
standards, and different people seldom mean just the 
same thing by the term “results.” 
(2) Many important products of training in reading can- 
not be measured by scales now available. It is par- 
ticularly difficult to measure the quality of first-grade 
reading.

(3) Measurement of more advanced reading has revealed 
so far nothing more than a suggestion regarding the 
probable factors influencing the development of cer- 
tain qualities. 
Have we, then, no secure or reliable basis for judgment? 
Is the sea still quite uncharted after all these years of effort 
to find rational guidance? The case is by no means so hope- 
less since psychologists have analyzed the learning process 
and defined the laws of learning, and since numerous care- 
fully conducted experiments have established certain im- 
portant facts in the psycho-physical process of reading. 
Thorndike ! points out that, in acquiring or improving 
any complex mental function, there are an enormous number 
of bonds or neurone connections to establish or strengthen. 
He says: ‘“‘Learning is connecting; and teaching is the ar- 
rangement of situations which will lead to desirable bonds 
and make them satisfying.” Further discussion shows that 
learning would be immeasurably facilitated if we could know 
exactly the best order for the exercise of particular bonds, 
but that in no single skill, such as piano-playing, typewrit- 
ing, or reading, has the best order been determined with 
certainty. In the last-named skill, however, certain factors 
are recognized as very influential. 
Importance oF INTEREST AND ZEAL ON THE Part OF THE 
Larner 
Interest and zeal on the part of the learner and a feeling of 
satisfaction in the process and in the accomplishment of re- 
sults are of such high importance that it is safe to assume 
that an order of procedure which greatly lessens, destroys, or 
postpones these attitudes cannot be the best order. For 
example, in teaching children piano-playing it has been 
found that much better success is obtained by starting them 
1. L. Thorndike: Educational Psychology, vol. u, chap. v- 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  200 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
almost immediately with little melodies, instead of requiring 
them to spend weeks and months as formerly on dull scales 
and exercises. Many teachers have their pupils very early 
compose bits of melody themselves expressive of some idea 
or feeling. These changes have been made in recognition of 
the principle that straight attack on skill elements meaning- 
less to the child leaves out of account the very influential 
and beneficial factors, zeal in effort and keen satisfaction in 
the results. This satisfaction lies at the bottom of what 
Thorndike calls the law of effect in the learning process. 
Operating negatively, this law causes whatever brings dis- 
satisfaction, annoyance, discomfort, or disappointment to 
the learner, to be avoided by him so far as possible, or, under 
necessity, to be endured or half-heartedly undertaken. 
It seems clear that in teaching reading we should not begin 
with elements corresponding to scales and finger exercises in 
piano-playing. Drill in phonic elements, exercises in analy- 
sis and synthesis of “families” of unrelated words, the use of 
charts and primers which entirely ignore higher thought pro- 
cesses all go counter to the principle just presentedy The 
old error of thinking that the logical order in imparting 
knowledge or developing skill must be the best order still 
persists. It is argued that reading, being an exceedingly 
complex process, the numerous habits involved cannot be 
acquired simultaneously or with equal perfection at any 
given time; therefore mastery of foundational mechanics 
should be kept well ahead of all other features. It is true 
that the many subsidiary habits which compose the total 
unitary habit of the practiced reader cannot proceed at equal 
pace, but they can be made to facilitate each other rather 
than interfere. At different stages one or another of the 
component habits, such as mastery of word-forms, response 
to phonic elements, quick reading of phrases, and thinking of 
meanings, may need to be especially emphasized, but it is
-P-A-G-E-213
  TEACHING BEGINNING READING 201 
certainly a mistake in any exercise called reading to ignore 
meanings. Yet many methods in vogue to-day do ignore, or 
greatly neglect for weeks and months, the one element with- 
out which there can be no real reading and without which 
zeal and satisfaction rest upon a very weak and temporary 
basis. It is true that the mere process of gaining mastery, the 
increasing evidence from day to day which the learner has 
that he can perform the task in hand and the praise which is 
elicited by his performance, give sufficient satisfaction to 
many children in the very beginning. But others respond 
only faintly to such stimuli, and all intelligent children soon 
grow indifferent if the more fundamental and permanent ap- 
peal of intrinsic interest is greatly minimized or postponed.

There is much evidence that the elementary habits in- 
volved in the total reading process, such as word-recognition, 
phrasing, and regular eye-movements, do not operate as 
readily and surely in the absence of well-organized and 
familiar content. Huey ! describes experiments made with 
adults which prove conclusively that a group of unrelated 
letters cannot be read as quickly as a series of nonsense 
syllables made up of an equal number of letters, and that a 
series of nonsense syllables requires more time than a well- 
constructed sentence of the same length. This is because 
the reader must actually look at every nonsense letter or 
nonsense word, whereas, in reading matter which has mean- 
ing, the eye is fixed for a fraction of a second each at only a 
few points ina line. As is quite generally known now, the 
practiced reader does not really see every word in reading a 
page of sensible matter. The eye moves more or less regu-

1908. 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
202 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
larly from point to point along a line and sees clearly only a 
short distance from each fixation point. The mind holds in 
consciousness what has just been read, seizes upon what is 
seen in a fixation pause, gets a hint here, a clue there, and 
instantly fills out and integrates the meaning from all of 
these elements. In fluent oral reading, the eye is always 
well ahead of the voice. Attention and thought pull the eye 
along, so to speak, in its physical work. It is clear, then, 
that interesting ideas, continuity, familiarity, and common, 
idiomatic English construction, all tend to facilitate the 
process. These elements have the effect of reducing the 
number of eye-pauses per line and shortening their duration. 
Among the clues which catch the eye and attention and 
aid in the total reading process, Huey mentions the percep- 
tion of characteristic word-forms, dominant letters in a 
word, simple phonetic elements, accustomed grammatical 
structure, and expectedness of ideas and events presented. 
No matter how easy a page of printed matter may seem, it is 
difficult to read if it is weak in ideas, if thought is confused, 
if the usage is unlike ordinary English, and if the words 
employed all look a good deal alike — if, in other words, 
they lack dominant characteristic form. 
Almost all of the older primers and first readers were 
marked by several or all of these defects. A generation or 
more ago beginners encountered lessons like the following: 
Do we go up? 
We do go up. 
So we do. 
Do as we do. 
So up we go. 
The idea was to make the first lessons easy by employing 
only two-letter words, since the children were obliged to 
learn to spell every word in a reading lesson. The spelling 
may have been easy, but the reading was hard.
-P-A-G-E-215
TEACHING BEGINNING READING 208 
The following is a primer lesson in which phonics is the 
main idea. Even an experienced adult reader is likely to 
hesitate and stumble more or less over matter of this sort 
and to read word by word rather than in larger units. Many 
of the words look so much alike that it is easy to confuse 
them, and there is no welding together of words into large 
thought wholes. There is so little relatedness between the 
sentences that one does not in any way suggest the next. It is 
impossible, therefore, to anticipate anything that is coming, 
and both eye and thought tend to move at a plodding rate. 
May is on the cot. 
It-is a hot day. 
It is too hot to play. 
May is in a cool spot. 
Dot is with May. 
Dot is May’s cat. 
May’s cat is fat. 
See Dot play with May’s hat! 
With material in which ideas have been so completely 
subordinated to a reading technique, it is impossible really 
to think. The more one tries to think, the more confused 
one is likely to become even in the mechanical reactions. 
Merely call off the words in the following selection from the 
Ward Primer ' and all goes fairly smoothly. Try to think 
about it and a practiced reader will often hesitate and 
blunder: 
The girl is not 
like the dog. She 
is like me. She looks 
like me. 
Well, I like the 
girl. 
Are the boy and 
the girl well?

is not. 
She looks well;

Look at me, girl; 
Are you well? 
Iam well, boy. 
Do I not look well? 
You do look well. 
It is impossible to get any clear idea regarding the girl’s 
health and it seems to be best not to think about it. Chil- 
dren attempting to read such material are practically forced 
to mere word-calling. The Ward readers were in their day 
a very successful series, but they were published when less 
emphasis was placed upon content than at present. 
The next example is not from some antiquated book, but 
is a more than fair imitation of a type found in primers of 
to-day which are widely used and warmly defended. The 
subject is more interesting than in the preceding examples, 
and attention has been given to natural phrasing so that 
groups of words belong together and can be learned together. 
This lesson lacks, however, many of the elements especially 
conducive to good reading habits.

The “story” which follows the couplet is clearly practice 
material contrived for the purpose of wringing every possible 
recombination of words and phrases out of those contained 
in the couplet. Nine different words are made to serve 
as the vehicle for a page containing a total of seventy-one 
words, and a single small idea is spread so thin that there is 
no forward-impelling sequence in the relation of the short 
sentences. The selection can be read backwards just as 
well as forwards: that is, the sentences may be read in re- 
verse order without impairing the sense at all. Alternate 
lines may be omitted altogether, or sentences may be thrown 
into any random order you choose for oral reading, and your 
audience will not know the difference. This shows, of, 
course, a very inferior kind of organization, and it seems 
clear that the higher reading habits are being greatly sub- 
ordinated to the lower. 
UnouE Insistence on THOROUGHNESS MAY IMPEDE 
Progress 
The notion that five or ten words must be known perfectly 
in a very narrow setting before a child may be permitted to 
go forward and encounter any more words is the cause of 
much of this wearisome reiteration. Those who hold this 
view have left out of account two iniportant considerations: 
first, that repetition with variety is better than monotonous 
repetition because attention is stronger, and, second, that 
out of multiple associations the right reaction is more likely 
to come than from a single association. To illustrate the 
Inst point — if the word blue is associated with sky, flag, 
dress, bird, sled, Boy Blue, etc., in interesting relations, it is 
more likely to be recognized and remembered than if linked 
up with flowers only. Any method which requires intensive 
and protracted work on a very small number of words, and 
forbids the introduction of new and stimulating ideas until

these are perfectly mastered, is undoubtedly sacrificing 
higher values to a wrong conception of thoroughness. It 
may be that mere word-acquisition also progresses at a 
slower pace than is necessary. 
Compare with the above selections the following simple 
version of a popular old folk-tale intended for early use with 
beginning classes: 
An old woman found a sixpence. 
She wanted a pig. 
She said, 
“T can get a pig. 
I can get a pig with the sixpence.” 
And she did. 
The pig came to a stile. 
The old woman said, 
“Pig, pig, get over the stile.” 
The pig said, 
“T won't get over the stile.” 
And he ran away.! 
Here we have repetition, which is an inherent part of the 
literary structure. The language approximates that in 
everyday use; there is sequence and consequence in the 
events; and this closely knit structure is an aid not only to 
thinking about what is read, but to the more automatic re- 
sponses included in the reading process. This selection can- 
not be read backwards nor can whole phrases and sentences 
be omitted. There are many clues and cues (to use Huey’s 
expression) which aid in quick recognition, such as: char- 
acteristic word-forms of different length to catch the eye; as, 
sixpence, woman, stile, pig, etc.; idiomatic word-groups or 
phrases; an inevitable sequence of events; for many pupils, 
a previous acquaintance with the story; opportunity for 
thought-conveying illustrations. Such features help atten-

tion to move forward securely across the line of print and 
favor the habit of reading in larger units. 
Even where excellent stories of this type are used, some 
textbooks follow them up with a quantity of drill material 
using the same vocabulary. A story is twisted and turned, 
chopped up and retold in a wearisome manner, the intention 
being to insure the instant recognition of every word and 
phrase in a changed relation before a new story is taken up. 
Such an exaction soon converts a good story into practice 
material more objectionable, if possible, than that cited 
above. Where this plan is followed, it is quite common to 
spend six weeks or more in drill (usually twice a day) on the 
vocabulary of one story, recast with such inane reiteration 
as the following: + 
“T can get a pig,” said the woman. 
Said the old woman, “I can get a pig.” 
“With a sixpence, I can get a pig.” 
She did get a pig. 
She did get a pig, with a sixpence. 
The old woman came to a stile. 
The pig came to a stile. 
The old woman and the pig came to a stile. 
Etce., ete. 
This dull repetition is quite unnecessary, since good story 
material can always be approached from some new angle. 
Suppose the story in the textbook is “The Gingerbread 
Boy.” At the time the children are working on this story, 
the making of gingerbread boys becomes a popular enterprise 
and simple accounts of the associated activities offer abun- 
dant repetition for a large part of the vocabulary. 
If a domestic science laboratory is available, primary 
teachers often plan and put through the actual baking of

enough cookies for the class. The children work with the 
teacher in small committees helping to mix, roll out, and cut 
the cookies. Asa part of the experience such reading matter 
as the following is evolved: 
We are going to make gingerbread boys. 
We will make thirty boys. 
We will cut them out 
and put them in the pans. 
Miss will put the pans 
in the oven. 
Our gingerbread boys cannot run away.

Miss put the pans in the oven. 
She took the pans out. 
Our gingerbread boys did not run away. 
My boy is brown. 
He is a good gingerbread boy. 
I am going to eat you, gingerbread boy. 
If the actual baking of cookies is not feasible, the story 
may be told in the sand box and certain features may be 
described in language and reading exercises. For example: 
I made a clay boy. 
He looks like the gingerbread boy. 
I made a clay dog, and a cat 
and a fox. 
I made a road in the sand.

AvorpANcre or Att ANALysIs AND Drint may Leap 
To Inerricient Hasits 
The desire to avoid a rigid and narrow procedure and the 
belief that “thoroughness” is often overdone has led in some 
quarters to a practical abandonment of any kind of orderly 
and definite plan for teaching beginning reading. An easy- 
going optimism seems to say that if enough attractive, easy 
books are placed before children, and if other skillful stimu- 
lation is furnished, they will find their way into the art 
chiefly through memorization of stories and repeated loca- 
tion of words. There is no evidence that the majority of 
beginners will make normal and sure progress in acquiring 
the various controls essential to good reading habits without 
very careful and intelligent guidance and training. On the 
other hand, there is a good deal of evidence that long-con- 
tinued use of a one-sided method such as children are likely 
to stumble upon often sets up a kind of eye-movement quite 
unlike that of the efficient reader and gives a misconception 
regarding the reading process very hard to correct. 
A misapplication of the principle of pupil initiative in be- 
ginning reading and the premature emphasis on choice on 
the part of young pupils invite disaster also. The desire to 
read orally in a social situation may stimulate a child to 
choose and to drill himself upon a selection which he is not at 
all ready for and which he cannot in any true sense read. 
The teacher, the mother, or a more advanced pupil hears the 
child practice the selection a number of times until he is 
ready to offer it before the group. The story or poem is 
practically memorized and few of the separate words are 
really known. If this goes on for long without adequate 
training in word-recognition, phrase-reading, and following 
the printed line in the correct manner, there is a fair chance 
that the child will develop into a case calling for remedial

work. Pupils have been known to advance into the second 
half of the second year still under the delusion that memori- 
zation was the main element in reading. 
Important Inpications or Recent EXPERIMENTS 
A unique contribution to the question under discussion 
has been made by Guy T. Buswell ! in an investigation de- 
scribed in Chapter III of the monograph previously men- 
tioned. This chapter is called a ‘‘ Detailed Analysis of First- 
Grade Reading.” While the author disclaims belief that the 
experiments described have settled anything regarding rela- 
tive merits of different methods of teaching beginning read- 
ing, certain tendencies of these methods are clearly indicated. 
The experiment was with first-grade pupils from two 
schools in which different methods of teaching beginning 
reading were employed. One class was in the Chicago Uni- 
versity Elementary School and the other was in a neighbor- 
ing public school. 
The essential points of contrast between the two methods are as 
follows: The public school emphasized word-analysis and recogni- 
tion above everything else, giving a very large amount of drill in 
this element. It attempted to stimulate an attitude of interest 
toward the selection to be read, but not by telling it in the words of 
the text. The University School placed the chief emphasis upon 
securing a correct reading attitude by which the child would look 
for the meanings in the selection. It did this by letting the child 
memorize the story before reading it. This was followed by phrase 
and word drill, but with much less attention to words than in the 
public school. The University School also gave more opportunity 
for silent study of the story to be read. In summary, the public 
school method emphasized mastery of mechanics; the University 
School emphasized the process of fusing the words and phrases into 
meaningful units.

Photographs of the eye-movements of I B pupils in oral 
and silent reading were taken during the seventh, thirteenth, 
and seventeenth weeks of the school year. Similar records 
of the I A pupils, made at the same time, represented a school 
experience of twenty-five, thirty-one, and thirty-five weeks. 
A dictaphone was used in connection with oral reading, and 
this instrument gave clear evidence regarding all hesitations, 
omissions, miscalled words, and substitutions, as well as the 
degree of rhythmic phrasing attained. The full analysis and 
graphic representation of these records is very interesting 
and significant. The following passage gives a brief sum- 
mary of results: ! 
By means of these detailed case analyses the immediate’ out- 
comes of two contrasting methods have been shown. If the pri- 
mary emphasis is placed upon word-recognition, the outcome is the 
ability to follow the printed lines, to pronounce all the words, but 
to display no vital concern for the content. It produces what is 
familiarly called word-reading. ‘This is not the complete attitude 
of the mature reader. The method goes far in the development of 
word-recognition, an element which all pupils must ultimately de- 
velop. It leaves much to be done in securing an attitude of reading 
by thought wholes. 
On the other hand, when the chief emphasis is placed upon the 
thought and the story is memorized, the pupils do develop a vital 
concern for the content, but develop more slowly in word-recogni- 
tion and in ability to follow the lines. 
Neither method should be judged by the outcomes at the end of 
the first semester. The purpose of analysis is to indicate that the 
two methods start out by different routes, one emphasizing words, 
the other emphasizing content. Ultimately the pupils must be- 
come mature in both. The important fact is that the teacher 
recognize that the adoption of either method means the carrying 
over of the undeveloped elements to a higher level in school. The 
selection of a method resolves itself into a question of which ele- 
ments shall be developed first and what shall be the rate of develop- 
ment. Ultimately all the fundamental elements must be carried 
to maturity.

Wuar Service SHOULD Puonic Exercises RENDER? 
There has been much discussion of the question “‘ Phonics 
or no phonics?” in teaching reading. For schools in general, 
probably the more valid questions are, What phonics should 
be taught? and when? and how? Few people believe that no 
training whatever should be given in word-analysis and in 
the sound values of letters and other phonograms. Those 
who argue that children of an earlier period learned to read 
by the alphabet method without phonetic drill forget that 
contemporary with this method was the speller with its a-b, 
ab; e-b, eb; 7-b, ib; etc. And those who claim that children 
learn to read wholly by the unanalyzed recognition of words 
and phrases in extensive reading have in mind individual 
children and small selected groups rather than large mixed 
classes. The fact is that these children who are said to learn 
to read without phonics have simply been unusually clever 
in learning the fundamentals of English sound structure. 
They have done alone what most children need some aid to 
accomplish economically. The fact, however, that a con- 
siderable number of children do make many of these deduc- 
tions almost unconsciously, and get very early a working 
knowledge of phonics, ought to cause us to look with some 
suspicion on highly elaborate and long-drawn-out schemes 
for systematic drill. Without doubt large numbers of chil- 
dren are being subjected daily to these logically detailed 
systems who would do better in the long run if the mechanics 
were much reduced. While there is little evidence that at- 
tention to mechanics can be entirely dispensed with, there is 
much reliable evidence that a high level of well-balanced 
attainment can be secured with a very moderate amount of 
this type of instruction. 
All work in phonics should be deferred until children 
have a clear conception of the function of printed words and
-P-A-G-E-225
  TEACHING BEGINNING READING 213 
sentences. They should be able to use this new skill in 
really getting thought from blackboard lessons, charts, cards, 
signs, and the first half of primers, before any step is taken to 
attract attention to more minute elements. 
Any method which does not allow in the beginning an 
extensive acquaintance with word-wholes encountered in . 
meaningful context is forced to confront young children with 
long lists of quite meaningless words for the sole purpose of 
picking them to pieces. The newest and most exploited 
phonic systems, as well as the old, offer for drill such words 
as jib, cud, bond, hilt, nape, fad, fume, mete, dote, vim, quell, 
quip, boon, mood, yam, lax, quench, prim, brig, squills, mute, 
wend, woe, moat, cloy, loin, foil, punt, gram, brash, lush, bane, 
wen, mode, etc. 
Analytical work should not be done for its own sake; no word or 
practice should be introduced for the sake of the system, a common 
defect of most phonetic practices.! 
With a little delay and moderation, school life (including 
experience with books) will furnish plenty of familiar and 
significant words for necessary analysis and classification. 
It is generally conceded by those who have made the most 
searching investigation that consciousness of the mechan- 
ics involved actually interferes with the reading process. 
Judd * says: “Mechanical training does, indeed, temporarily 
prevent the pupil from understanding the meaning of pas- 
sages. Mechanical training would not be justified if distrac- 
tions could be avoided by ready recognition of words.” 
Incorrect or exaggerated sounding of words, and drill out 
of proportion to use in thoughtful reading, tend to set up

  214 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
useless and abnormal reactions of speech organs in both oral 
and silent reading. ‘ The tendency to lip-reading is especially 
strong in children overtrained and badly trained in phonics. 
In a recent investigation of reading disability Dr. Gates ! 
sums up some of these undesirable results: 
Inappropriate forms of phonic, phonetic, or other types of analytical 
training result frequently in unfavorable types of perception and in 
other ineffective habits. For example: 
a. Super-sufficient reaction to details of words, resulting in slow, 
laborious reading, in a variety of errors, in inability to grasp 
sufficiently large units of words, and in inability to attack long 
words effectively. 
b. Placement of emphasis on wrong characteristics of words, or 
dividing words in ways ineffective for ready recognition. 
e. Progressing by too small units which may lead to inappropri- 
ate habits of eye movements. 
d. Habits of too explicit articulation which may lead to an in- 
hibition of the development of speed in silent reading. 
e. Habits of reacting primarily by efforts to pronounce accurately 
which may lead to inadequacy of comprehension. 
f. Habits of not looking ahead in reading, i.e., too narrow eye- 
voice span. 
There are systems of teaching reading which Test almost 
wholly upon an elaborate and exhaustive training in phon- 
ics. There are other methods which greatly subordinate the 
phonic work and present very gradually the most funda- 
mental elements as means toward getting control over 
worth-while reading matter. It is a noticeable fact that, in 
those centers which have been most influenced by the nu- 
merous scientific contributions to the teaching of reading, 
phonic work is of the latter type. 
There is one important phase of phonic work which re- 
ceives, as a rule, very little attention either in theory or in 
practice. The great service of proper exercises in developing:

    TEACHING BEGINNING READING 215 
pleasing tone, proper breath control, clear, clean-cut enun- 
ciation, and correct pronunciation is almost completely lost 
sight of in the constant agitation regarding phonics as a 
means of teaching reading. There is much to be learned 
which would benefit normal children from a study of cor- 
rectional work in speech defects. It should be the aim of 
teachers of normal children to eradicate by proper exercise 
those defects which are due to easily controlled causes. 
Gesell ! offers some very helpful suggestions for this type of 
phonetic work with normal children. 
Wauat is tHe Revative Importance or Sinent READING 
IN First and Suconp GRADES? 
Reasons for the present emphasis on silent reading from 
the fourth grade on have been forcibly presented in nu- 
merous recent discussions of the subject. Many experi- 
ments and investigations have been made and ample data 
have been presented to show conclusively that silent reading 
is more efficient in every way than oral. It is now quite 
generally understood and accepted that much time has been 
wasted in drilling upper-grade pupils in oral reading, and the 
tendency, therefore, is to give much careful training in silent 
reading, since that is the type chiefly called for in daily 
life. 
To what extent should the work of the lower grades be in- 
fluenced by this movement? Are there differences in condi- 
tions and needs in the early stages of the reading process 
which call for different evaluation of oral and silent reading? 
It seems that many of the arguments that have influenced 
the present trend in upper-grade reading are not valid for 
the earlier stages. We will examine some of these points. 
1. Silent reading is more rapid than oral. 
This only begins to be true at about third grade. Ac- 
1 Gesell, A. L. and B. C.: The Normal Child and Primary Education.
-P-A-G-E-228
  216 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
cording to Gray’s summary ! of various investigations, “The 
rate of silent reading surpasses the rate of oral reading be- 
tween the second and fourth grades.” 
Stone * says: 
The rate of oral reading is necessarily limited by the muscular 
activities involved in articulating and pronouncing, while silent 
reading has no such limitation. In the primary grades the rate at 
which the pupil can interpret the meaning of the symbols is not 
greater, and sometimes even less, than the rate of vocalization in 
oral reading. But some place in the development of the child’s 
reading ability, probably about the end of the third grade with the 
average pupil, the rate at which the pupil can comprehend in silent 
reading exceeds his articulation rate in oral reading. 
It has been found that in the main pupils who do well in oral 
reading do well in silent reading: This probably means that the 
development of smooth, fluent oral reading in the primary grades 
is an important aid in the development of proper eye-movement 
habits in silent reading. 
2. The eye-voice span is shorter in oral reading than is the 
span of recognition in silent reading, hence there are more fixa~ 
tion pauses. In consequence oral reading tends to set wp in- 
effective eye-movement habits. 
Again, this does not seem to be an important factor below 
fourth grade. Dr. Buswell’s * figures show how slight is the 
difference through third grade. The present writer has 
combined Dr. Buswell’s “Grade Medians for Eye-Move- 
ments”? so as to make a closer comparison of rate, etc., 
in silent and oral reading. Only the data for grades I B 
to IV A inclusive are used here, although the authority 
quoted gives the facts for each school grade.

The above table means that median I B pupils averaged

the showing in this respect is better for oral than for silent 
reading in Grades I B and I A, and that silent reading has a 
slight advantage in Grades IT A and ITI A and a considerable 
advantage in Grade IV A. There is a steady improvement 
in the function in both types of reading from the second 
grade on.

In the above table, length of fixations are expressed in 
twenty-fifths of a second. That is, the average duration of 
eye-pause for median pupils in Grade I B was 16.5 twenty- 
fifths of a second in silent reading and 19.2 twenty-fifths of 
a second in oral reading. The advantage of silent over 
oral in this respect is slight even in fourth grade, 6.7 for the 
former and 7.7 for the latter. 
Any one sufficiently interested in the evidence to consult 
the original monograph will find that, in the matter of re- 
gressive eye-movements, silent reading is not superior to

-P-A-G-E-230
  218 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
oral in grades below the fourth. By regressive movements 
is meant movements and fixations backward along the line 
to pick up the thread of thought, to correct or verify an im- 
pression, or to puzzle out some difficulty. 
The material used in these reading tests had an average of 
almost exactly nine words per line for all grades. A glance at 
Table VII shows that in all primary grades the median num- 
ber of eye-pauses per line is equal to or greater than the num- 
ber of words per line. That is, on the average, pupils up to and 
including third grade, fixate on every word and fixate more 
than once on some words whether reading silently or orally. 
So long as the learner is at this stage, probably just as effect- 
ive help can be given through oral as through silent exercise. 
There are other reasons, however, why silent reading should 
receive a fair amount of attention in lower primary grades. 
1. The real significance of the art of reading is impressed 
when beginners see that eye and mind unaided by voice 
can get from the printed page directions, instructions, 
and interesting ideas. 
2. Means of self-help can be provided in silent reading 
better than in oral. 
8. In group work, all the children can be more active all 
the time in silent than in oral reading. Exercises in 
quick recognition are easy to conduct insuring alert 
concerted effort. 
4. Children need training in silent reading since the latter 
should not be like oral reading merely rendered in- 
articulate. Lip movements can only be suppressed 
through properly directed silent reading. 
5. After good habits have been started, silent reading 
offers the best means for children to advance at their 
individual rate. 
Sources of good material for silent reading are mentioned 
in the next chapter and in the Appendix, but no one need

depend entirely on published material. Any alert and 
thoughtful teacher can easily produce exercises for beginners 
especially well suited to her own pupils. Some of the Horace 
Mann teachers are using what the children call their “Study 
Book.” This is a blank book or a loose-leaf book in which 
are inserted printed questions or directions which the chil- 
dren are to read and respond to in the appropriate manner. 
Some of these call for pictures to be drawn or colored and 
Make a picture

others call for cut-out parts to be arranged and pasted, 
When the children have learned to write or print, questions 
requiring a few words in reply are included. Figs. 21 and 
22 show examples of this home-made material taken from 
the book of a first-grade child.

Variep Purposes IN READING SHOULD BE MET 
Considering the varied uses to which the art of reading is 
put as soon as a fair degree of skill is obtained, it seems un- 
wise to limit to the field of literature the material used in,the 
first two school years. We read both for pleasure and for 
information, and our pleasure-reading is not all of one kind 
or, at least, it should not be so narrowly chosen. But since 
so many good literature reading texts have been supplied, 
there seems to be a very strong tendency to neglect all other 
types of reading matter during the early primary years. No
-P-A-G-E-233
  TEACHING BEGINNING READING 221 
one doubts the keen interest which almost all children have 
in the best fairy- and folk-tales, but this is not an exclusive 
taste and they enjoy also stories of other children or realistic 
stories. They like also to make records of their own doings 
either for future reference or to take home to read to others. 
These home-made stories may be the forerunner of informa- 
tional reading in higher grades along the line of science, his- 
tory, and current events. Many successful teachers secure 
a good part of their reading matter for the first eight or ten 
weeks from accounts composed by the children of the many 
interesting and valuable activities in which they are engaged 
from day to day. Here are three pages of a treasured book 
made by first-grade children. The repetition and cadence 
in the third selection make it particularly suitable as an 
early reading exercise.

The daily bulletin is a valuable adjunct in teaching read- 
ing. The teacher uses it as a means of real communication, 
and the children soon learn to look at a certain spot in the 
room when they enter, expecting to find some interesting bit 
of news, a word of special greeting, or some necessary in- 
struction. When Miss Gail Harrison taught the first grade 
at the Lincoln School of Teachers College, she accomplished 
a very large part of the early work in reading through the 
extensive use of this means of communication and record. 
A little group might have been seen any morning standing 
in front of blackboard or bulletin board on one or the other 
of which some message was to be found. Often there was a 
dashing picture drawn or a bright cut-out picture posted as

a part of the news. On page 227 is a photograph of one 
of Miss Harrison’s bulletins. This one was composed of 
separate printed strips, this means serving well to aid in 
mastering a part at a time. 
Progressive teachers have used such material for many 
years, and the practice ought not to be neglected simply be- 
cause-writers and publishers are supplying us with superior 
books. The fact that the children have participated in the 
events described, that they are thoroughly familiar with the 
subject, and are themselves joint authors in the composition, 
not: only adds interest to the reading, but facilitates the 
process and makes possible and safe the use of a larger vo- 
cabulary than would be advisable otherwise. It is possible 
to have a good deal of purposeful repetition in composing 
and reading records of this kind, and it is not difficult to 
duplicate to a considerable extent the vocabulary which 
pupils are meeting or will meet in their first books.

Although the style, the type, and the content of news- 
papers are on the whole unsuited to children in primary 
grades, a close inspection from day to day reveals many in- 
cidents and bits of news which, when recast, are both ap- 
propriate and interesting. In some families the older mem- 
bers take pains to read aloud scraps of news to the younger 
ones, thus helping them to grow into a fuller understanding 
of a larger world of people and events. One who has not 
made this careful examination of a good daily paper for bits 
suited to children will be surprised at the yield. 
Such material can be used in several ways. Occasionally 
good headlines may be clipped and pinned on the classroom 
bulletin board. Pupils will form the habit of looking at this 
board every morning and will make an effort to read the

“news.” The teacher will provide most of this material. 
Here are a few appropriate headlines.

GET OUT YOUR FLAGS 
As a rule, however, items will need to be rewritten and 
greatly simplified for grades below the fourth. If the teacher 
has a typewriter at hand, the revised copy may be quickly 
run off and placed on the bulletin board. If this is not 
feasible, parts of the item as published may be read to 
the children and they may assist in retelling the story, the 
teacher writing or printing it on the board. If the story is 
of more than passing interest, she may feel that it is worth 
putting into more permanent form for reading again. For 
such duplication a typewriter having large primer type is 
the most satisfactory instrument, though a good hectograph 
will serve. 
The following article (only a part of which is quoted) was 
taken from the New York Times in the spring of 1923. First-

get in such a hospital. But yesterday Marcella, the gentlest of the 
baby elephants with the circus, went up with some clowns and 
midgets and the baby horse to pay a visit to the children of the 
Hospital for Ruptured and Crippled Children at 321 East Forty- 
Second Street. 
A teacher in the advanced first grade secured through dis- 
cussion the following simple account of the incident, and it 
was written on the board as the children contributed state- 
ments. She copied it later on the typewriter, pupils added 
lively and amusing illustrations and it became a favorite in 
the book of “original” stories compiled during the year.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A TEACHING PRocEDURE 
1. Begin with reading matter having meaning and worth 
to the children. This may include directions, an- 
nouncements, other information, original _ stories, 
thymes and tales, etc., on blackboard, home-made 
charts, and “quick perception” cards. 
2. By above means, build up vocabulary of one hundred 
to two hundred words which pupils recognize readily 
in any situation. In determining the vocabulary be 
, guided largely by textbooks to be used first half-year. 
3. Do not wait until this vocabulary is acquired before 
using a primer as children are eager to read from real 
books. Let experience in (1) prepare background-for 
occasional use of primer before end of second month of 
regular work. 
4. Read aloud to pupils letting them see the books from 
which stories and poems are taken. 
5. Have as full and as good an assortment as possible of 
charming well-made picture books, primers, first read- 
ers, story books, collections of verse, etc. 
6. Provide low bookshelves and a “library” table. Ar- 
range so that individuals and small groups may go to
-P-A-G-E-244
232 
10. 
11. THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
these books freely. Teach children how to use books. 
Try to start the “library habit.” 
Provide games, puzzles, cards for matching words and 
pictures, phonic building cards, and any other good 
material through which children may teach themselves 
somewhat. 
Do not allow children to take books home and do not 
encourage children to ‘‘teach” each other until certain 
fundamentally important attitudes and habits have 
been well started. In providing this safeguard, how- 
ever, one should be careful not to frustrate and disap- 
point the ambitious children. From time to time very 
easy material may be taken home to show what has 
been accomplished. 
. In advanced first grade, and later, have a separate _ 
period when pupils may read aloud to the group, selec- 
tions which they have chosen and especially prepared. 
These selections should not be too difficult and in 
Grades I and II at least, time must be provided when 
teacher can guide in efficient study methods. 
No word analysis until a good working vocabulary has 
been acquired. Then note and emphasize similarities 
and differences in words which pupils are meeting.

QUESTIONS 
. Why is the claim that good results are obtained by a certain 
method of teaching reading not a sufficient basis for the un- 
critical acceptance of the method? 
. Why is it unreasonable to believe that some one method is 
better than any other known method for general use? 
. How do the content and organization of early reading material 
influence reading habits? Why are the “easy” selections on 
pages 203 and 204 really difficult? 
. Does the principle of thoroughness justify spending six weeks 
or more on one small story? What arguments against such 
a plan? 
. What are some wasteful and perhaps injurious practices in 
teaching phonics? 
. Would you be willing to have silent reading substituted very 
largely for oral reading in first and second grade? Give 
reasons for the position you take on this question. 
. What are the main points in favor of using children’s own 
interesting experiences as subject-matter for reading?

CHAPTER XII 
WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LATER WORK 
IN READING? 
Ir was a common attitude in the past regarding the teaching 
of reading, that no particular technique was called for be- 
yond the second grade. This idea may not have been ad- 
vocated in theory, but it was commonly acted on in practice. 
Until rather recently the demand for expertness in teaching 
fourth-grade reading, for example, has not been very promi- 
nent. Students in training, teachers in service, and in- 
structors in methods courses would have found it difficult to 
mention for this grade specific skills to be developed and 
definite factors in teaching procedure. The notion was 
quite general that after children were well started, the chief 
requirement was to carry oral reading to fuller perfection, 
and that the way to do this was through extended practice 
in oral reading. 
The contrast between the over-systematized and exacting 
demands which called for no independent thought on the 
part of teachers of beginning reading, and the vague expec- 
tation regarding the later work, is strikingly shown in the 
following paragraph from a city superintendent’s report for 
1914: 
The distinct methods of instruction furnished to the teachers of 
the first two years give them most elaborately planned manuals for 
daily procedure. The ordinary, average, or new teacher can, by 
closely following the manual, produce excellent results. . . . Little 
or no initiative or thoughtful planning is required of the teacher in 
the first two years — all is planned for her. Her duty is merely to 
follow along lines of given procedure. The excellent results con- 
tinue into the third year from their own momentum; but in the
-P-A-G-E-247
LATER WORK IN READING 285 
fourth year a distinct break is found, and the reason, I am con- 
vinced, is because the teacher is here thrown upon her own re- 
sources. 
The more thoughtful and competent teachers strove to 
broaden the scope of reading, to develop an interest in read- 
ing and to help pupils to comprehend, interpret, and enjoy 
in fuller measure. They also tried to increase facility by en- 
larging the vocabulary in whatever way they could. But 
the ordinary teaching procedure was about as follows: 
1. To present in advance all new words of the lesson. 
2. Have them pronounced and perhaps defined or used in 
a sentence. 
8. Drill on phonetic elements of especially difficult words. 
4, Assignment, “Study this lesson.” 
5. Recitation proper. Pupils read orally in turn short 
passages to demonstrate degree of fluency attained. 
The usual mode of study consisted in reviewing the new 
words and then reading silently straight through the selec- 
tion. The pupil’s purpose was to practice so that he might 
read the lesson without stumbling the next day. The more 
painstaking children often read the selection more than once 
at study-time and tried to make this silent reading approxi- 
mate as nearly as possible the desired oral effect as to rate, 
emphasis, dramatic expression, etc. Teacher and children 
conceived of study as a sort of inaudible rehearsal for a 
public performance. 
At the recitation period pupils read in turn, longer or 
shorter passages, and the teacher’s activity centered largely 
in attempting to get better expression from the class. 
We now know that there are problems belonging to this 
stage which are just as definite and important as those which 
concern the earlier steps. New needs and increased capacity 
of pupils call for changed technique and shift of emphasis in 
teaching. These problems have been suggested and clarified
-P-A-G-E-248
  236 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
by numerous and extensive studies in the psychology of the 
reading process and by attempts to interpret the results 
of achievement tests now widely used. The application of 
more intelligent methods of study has had its influence also. 
Sirent Reaping Must BE TauGcut AND Not LEFT TO 
Cuance DrevELOPpMENT 
As soon as children have reached the stage where they can 
read more rapidly than they can articulate, practice in oral 
reading is no longer so efficient a means of further improve- 
ment. As already stated, this stage is commonly reached 
during the third or fourth grade. This indicates the wis- 
dom of increasing at this time the amount of well-directed, 
intelligent silent reading. 
Without special training many people have established 
for themselves excellent habits of silent reading with rapid 
rate and high degree of comprehension. We know that this 
is true because many adults possess such habits, although 
conscious training along this line is of very recent date. We 
may safely assume, therefore, that some of the young people 
of to-day will establish rhythmic eye-movements, a good 
rate, and quick comprehension as their elders did, largely 
through extensive silent reading impelled by interest. Mere 
quantity of silent reading, however, does not necessarily de- 
velop efficiency, though, other things being equal, one who 
reads much with eagerness and zest is likely to develop a 
better technique than one who reads little. Tests show that 
among children of similar school experience and approxi- 
mately equal ability in other respects some have acquired 
excellent habits, some have an inefficient technique, and 
others have formed habits so detrimental as to call for re- 
medial work. 
It is our business to know what kind of habits are being 
formed before a child reaches the stage where remedial 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
LATER WORK IN READING 237 
measures are needed. It is a mistake to leave so much to 
the less direct effect of oral reading and the chance effect of 
undirected, unintelligent study. This policy probably re- 
sults in a lower attainment for most pupils than is necessary. 
On this point Dr. Gates | says: 
Most of us eased off in our learning of reading, writing, and many 
other school functions as soon as we safely could — perhaps in the 
fifth or sixth grade — and entrenched ourselves in a low-level per- 
formance, from which we have never emerged. Few people know 
how rapidly they read or write, how efficiently they memorize or 
solve arithmetic problems; few know when their improvement 
came to an end, or whether they have made any improvement in 
the last year or ten years. If you should now suddenly undertake 
to increase your speed of reading, it would be found disturbing and 
perhaps unpleasant for a time, the inevitable result of breaking up 
an old organization of habits to supplant them by new. But this 
is the only way in which more effective habits — perfectly com- 
fortable once habituated — are attained. 
Obviously the first step is to find out what level the chil- 
dren have reached in silent reading. Close observation and 
some crude testing will reveal a good deal. One simple pro- 
cedure is about as follows: The teaeher takes ten or twelve of 
her class at a time, seats them so she can see just what each 
one does, gives them all the same selection from new well- 
graded material, and directs them to read as rapidly as they 
can without loss of meaning. As they read, the teacher 
watches closely for signs of articulation, lip-movement, 
mechanical methods of keeping the place, and pronounced 
skipping. She lets them continue until the fastest readers 
have read several pages and then asks all to stop, mark the 
point reached, and close books. The children are given some 
quiet work to keep them occupied, and one at a time they 
are called to a part of the room out of hearing of the others

-P-A-G-E-250
238 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
and questioned briefly on what they have read, the teacher 
using questions previously prepared. She notes the amount 
read by each child and the degree and kind of understanding 
displayed. A crude measure of a child’s achievement in 
silent reading is thus obtained from his rate of reading and 
from the comprehension shown. The teacher’s observation 
during the reading will often furnish a clue to the cause of 
inferior reading. 
It is desirable, however, to get a more accurate measure of 
accomplishment, and this is now widely done, especially from 
third grade on, by the use of standardized tests. The nature, 
use, and relative merits of the various available tests will not 
be discussed here. Full: information regarding them may 
be obtained from such books as Silent and Oral Reading, by 
C. R. Stone; How to Measure in Education, by W. A.McCall; 
and A Guide to Educational Measurements, by H. C. Hines. 
Tuer Conscious Co6PERATION OF THE CHILDREN 
is EssENTIAL 
We are interested in the significance of the tests to teacher 
and children and in the application of the results to problems 
of teaching and methods of study. Third-grade children 
are quite capable of understanding the purpose of tests in 
reading, and the meaning of the results. They should be 
told about the achievements desired and expected, the 
standard of attainment in their grade in other schools, and 
should be shown the graphs for their own class indicating 
where they stand in relation to the norm. 
There are a few facts concerning the art of reading which 
they should be told in a very simple way. They can under- 
stand the main difference between oral and silent reading; 
that in oral reading we are obliged to pronounce every 
word, while in silent reading we should pronounce as few as 
possible; that it is possible to let the eye “run along” the 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
LATER WORK IN READING 239 
line of print faster than the words can be uttered; and that 
one can read more rapidly silently and yet understand and 
remember just as well or better. Children at this stage can 
readily understand the bad effect of pointing, lip-movement, 
articulation, and dawdling in silent reading, and most of 
them can be led by a skillful teacher’ to desire to eliminate 
these habits. They can see the advantage of reading by 
phrases, and with some training they are capable of telling 
whether in their silent reading they look at and inwardly 
pronounce every word. 
In this attempt to make children more conscious as to 
objectives, the relative values of comprehension and speed 
must be made clear. The idea that the main purpose of 
reading is to get the thought should never be obscured, and 
they should not be stimulated to attempt a rate of reading 
which interferes with understanding and judgment. 
Dritt on Minor Processss vs. “THe Direct SYNTHETIC 
Mops or Arrack”’ 
Normal children who are merely at an immature stage in 
learning to read should not be subjected to the sort of exer- 
cises often employed to correct bad habits already fixed. 
In remedial work of any kind an analytical attack is some- 
times required. It may be necessary to break up a process 
into its parts in order to find out where the trouble lies and 
then drill on the several elements separately. This ought 
not to be necessary in normal progress from an imperfect to 
a more perfect control over a given function. There is some 
danger that this point will be lost sight of and that ingenious 
people will bestir themselves to invent material and exercises 
offering a sort of piecemeal training which is unnecessary 
except in special ¢éases. 
O’Brien ! is skeptical as to the gain likely to accrue from 
10’Brien, John A.: Silent Reading, pp. 82-84. The Macmillan Company, 
1921.
-P-A-G-E-252
  240 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
drill exercises devised to improve certain specific subsidiary 
processes isolated from the total reading process. He says: 
On the general principle of psychology, that one learns to do a 
thing by actually doing it, it would seem logical to assume that one 
could learn to read rapidly by practice in rapid reading. In con- 
trast with methods which analyze the reading complex into its 
main processes, and then devise types of training adapted to im- 
prove each of these specific processes separately, this may be said 
to be the direct synthetic mode of attack — training in the whole 
organized process of reading itself. This would seem to be the 
simplest and, at the same time, the most indispensable type of 
training. 
In the case of the specialized type of training adapted to secure 
the improvement of a single specific process, such as visual span, or 
character of eye-movement, in the reading complex, there is always 
the possibility that the improvement effected under controlled cir- 
cumstances may not be carried over into the actual reading situa- 
tion, where the circumstances affecting the functioning of a single 
isolated process can no longer be controlled. This may be due, 
among other causes, to the change in the reading situation which 
produces a corresponding modification in the response; or it may 
be due to the simultaneous functioning of other processes in the 
complex which tend more or less to inhibit or otherwise to affect 
the mode of operation of the specific factor subjected to the spe- 
cialized training. Thus, for example, training to increase the per- 
ceptual span by means of tachistoscopic exposures of single dis- 
connected phrases may actually — at least in the case of children 
— succeed in enlarging the visual span for such a type of reading. 
But whether the visual span enlarged for that specific type of per- 
ception would carry over into.a different situation, such as obtains 
in the reading of a selection of continuous closely related subject- 
matter, is uncertain. 
For, in the latter case, the situation differs considerably from the 
former. The subject-matter is no longer divided into phrases 
adapted for perception in a single fixation, but has all the words 
closely following one another in a printed line. There is, further- 
more, a central thread of thought running through the various 
phrases and sentences of the context, which furnishes meaning pre- 
monitions of the coming words and phrases, thus enabling them to 
be grasped in much less than the normal perception time. ... The
-P-A-G-E-253
LATER WORK IN READING 241 
well-nigh complete absence of these meaning premonitions in the - 
reading of discrete words, or phrases, exposed serially by means of 
the tachistoscope, shows how radically one reading situation may 
differ from another. It illustrates, moreover, the difference in the 
factors which are called into play, as well as the difference in their 
mode of functioning in the interpretation of the printed symbols, 
according as the reading situation varies. 
Considerations such as the above serve to emphasize the value of 
the direct method of attacking the problem of accelerating the rate 
of silent reading. 
The scheme which O’Brien presents in Chapters IV, V, 
and VI calls for the use of reading matter calculated to 
arouse and sustain interest, but relatively easy in character. 
He provides for intensive training in three factors involved 
in silent reading which he designates as: 
1. Training in rapid silent reading. 
2. Training to decrease vocalization. 
8. Training in perception. 
These factors are not to be isolated from the total reading 
process, but emphasis is to be placed upon them one at a 
time. The procedure recommended is simple, direct, non- 
technical, and entirely independent of device and apparatus. 
It appeals to the intelligence of the children and consists 
largely in helping them to hold in consciousness for brief 
practice periods certain ideals regarding rate, comprehen- 
sion, suppression of articulation, and length of perception 
span, and to put forth effort to attain these ideals. 
The author just quoted shows also how ineffective is all 
such special practice if teachers do not at the same time use 
every effort to have children employ in all ordinary reading 
situations the habits that have been started or developed in 
the special .work.

242 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
TRAINING IN SILENT READING THROUGH EspEcIALLY 
Dervisep Practice MATERIAL 
Individual teachers have for some years been evolving 
various kinds of material which children may use for self- 
improvement in silent reading. Gradually some of these 
aids are becoming generally available either as features of 
regular published systems for teaching reading or as inde- 
pendent units offered on their own merits. Most of these 
inventions were intended to assist in the early steps in read- 
ing, but now in various quarters teachers are attempting to 
apply the same principle to more advanced work. At pre- 
sent most of the latter type of material is still in the home- 
made stage, but it is safe to predict that before long much 
that is good and much that is of doubtful value will be on the 
market. 
Miss Jean Betzner, of the Horace Mann School, has 
worked out a large number of interesting exercises in silent 
reading. Most of them call for a considerable amount of 
thoughtful, intelligent, and independent reading. In order 
to follow the directions given, pupils have to read, think, 
judge, select, and organize. Practically all of Miss Betzner’s 
sets have been made from old copies of good readers or other 
discarded books and from pictures combined with some hand 
printing. They have not been published and therefore are 
not available for general use.! 
Four of these sets suited to second grade will be described. 
Similar ideas could be adapted to third grade if desired, using 
more difficult material. Each set is contained in a large 
strong envelope, on the outside of which clear directions are 
printed for the children to read and follow.

“Well,” said the poor crab, as the fox seized him, “this comes of 
going where I had no business to be. I should have stayed in the

Miss Alice Hanthorn and Miss Merle M. Beattie have 
evolved a simple type of reading card called Silent Reading 
Stories. This material has been published. The authors 
state that it is intended as “‘Seat-Work for Second and Third 
Grades.” 
To use these cards, it is only necessary that the children 
know in a general way twelve very familiar fables and folk- 
tales such as “The Hare and the Tortoise,” “The Boy and 
the Wolf,” “The Elves and the Shoemaker.” Two leading 
characters of each story are pictured in silhouette and there 
are printed statements to be cut apart. These statements 
always fall into two distinet groups. To quote the authors’ 
instructions: 
' Keep each story separate from all the other stories. Cut the 
pictures and sentences apart on the lines. Mix the sentences to- 
gether. 
Have the child place his silhouettes on his desk as though the 
characters were talking to each other. Each sentence represents 
something which one character is thinking or saying.... As the 
child reads a sentence he must decide to which character it belongs, 
and must place it under the proper silhouette. When all the sen- 
tences are separated the next step is to arrange them in their 
proper sequence. 
This material is not like the ordinary “cut-up”’ story. 
The sentences are not taken from a particular version nor do 
they when combined form the full text. Therefore the cards

cannot be selected and arranged purely by recall of partic- 
ular passages in sequence, but discrimination is constantly 
called for. 
It seems to the present writer that to check this work for 
correctness would consume a good deal of time. This defect 
could easily be obviated by adding some distinguishing code 
symbol which would help the teacher to determine quickly 
whether sentences are in the proper column or not. 
In evaluating all special exercises of this sort, it is impor- 
tant to keep in mind the purpose for which they are used. If 
the intention is to give extensive practice in reading, one 
should, of course, inquire, ““How much reading does this 
exercise actually provide?” Many suggested devices for 
silent reading call for. a maximum of drawing, coloring, sort- 
ing or arranging, and a minimum of reading. 
If the intention is to furnish exercises calculated to build 
up good habits of silent reading, the time element is an im- 
portant consideration. Children may dawdle and dream 
over work of this kind while the teacher is busy with another 
group. Without oversight there is no means of knowing 
whether they are reading at proper speed or not. 
However, if a quantity of good exercises are provided, and 
if there is frequent supervision so that standards can be built 
up, there is no reason why children may not greatly benefit 
by independent work of the same kind. 
Wuat 1s THE Prac or OrAt READING IN Upper PRIMARY 
GrapDEs? 
With the present insistence on the importance of training 
in silent reading, shall oral reading be largely displaced, or 
has it a particular service to render? 
It would seem that, after children have attained a fair 
mastery over the reading process, it should serve them for 
many social purposes in the school. Some of these purposes
-P-A-G-E-260
  248 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
will certainly call for oral reading. We ought never to get 
beyond the point where the pleasure of a delightful story or 
poem will be enhanced by reading it aloud — at least in 
part — to an appreciative hearer. Certain types of litera- 
ture make a direct appeal to the ear and a large part of the 
. charm is lost in silent reading. This is particularly true of 
poetry and of dramatic material whether in dialogue form or 
not. Humorous stories, too, gain in effect through the re- 
action of the quicker-witted members of a group. 
Some selections from writers possessing distinct literary 
style should be studied and read aloud because many chil- 
dren will discover very little of the characteristic beauty and 
delight if left to more or less solitary reading. This applies 
to such stories as Alice in Wonderland, Pinocchio, Uncle 
Remus, and many of the tales by Hans C. Andersen, Frank 
Stockton, Rudyard Kipling, and Hugh Lofting. 
The criticism is sometimes made that, as such material is 
pure literature, it should not be made to serve in the slightest 
degree for group practice, but should be used wholly for in- 
dividual pleasure-reading. The answer to this is that oral 
reading can and should be so conducted as to enhance the 
pleasure for the greater number rather than detract from it. 
Alice, Pinocchio, Dr. Doliitle, should not be subjected to 
routine drill exercise or plodding re-reading for the mere 
purpose of giving every one a chance to read aloud. But a 
second or even a third reading of such books may under some 
circumstances prove more delightful and stimulating than 
the first. It is well that this is so, for with the fine library 
facilities now offered in many communities a large number 
of children are partially familiar with a good deal of the 
literature which belongs to a certain grade before they enter 
that grade. It is the rare child, however, who cannot get a 
fresh and a deeper enjoyment from reading a choice book 
again in a rich social situation.

New Opsectives MAY CALL FoR THE Re-ReaDING OF A 
Crassic 
This can be illustrated by Lorenzini’s Pinocchio. In this 
story, the scene changes frequently and there are many 
characters who appear and reappear at intervals. The 
quick succession of incidents, some of which at first seem to 
have very little to do with the development of the story, 
proves confusing to many children the first time they read 
the book. Many leading questions suggest themselves only 
when one has finished the story. It then becomes evident 
that certain earlier scenes and incidents had some special 
significance. It is a delight now to read again in order to 
answer a larger question, seek support for an opinion, make 
an interesting association or establish a continuity of events 
only vaguely noted at first. 
Pinocchio is a little wooden marionette with a wooden 
head, no heart, rudimentary ears, and a cold-blooded de- 
termination to please himself at any cost. Through the ups 
and downs of his dramatic career, beguiled by picturesque 
enemies, and aided by faithful friends, he at last wins a boy’s 
soul and body. 
How did Pinocchio do this? 
Can we trace every step as he rose toward boyhood and 
fell, and rose again? 
What were some of his most wooden-headed notions? 
What were his most heartless acts? 
What was his first generous or faithful act? 
At what point does the story say that Pinocchio “had 
really a good heart?” 
When did you feel most sorry for him?

For extensive silent reading, library facilities of some 
sort are essential. This need is being met through the well- 
selected school library in charge of a librarian trained to 
work with children, through loan collections from the chil- 
dren’s department of the local public library, and through 
the small choice room library. One or all of these means 
may be used as conditions dictate, but there is no doubt 
that for the younger children an attractive collection of 
books in the classroom is a great asset. Here may be met 
in embryo many of the stimulating experiences of the larger 
library and many highly important habits may be well be- 
gun. The sense of personal ownership, helping to select the 
books, perhaps the added delight of earning money to buy 
some of them, assisting in “running” the library — all these 
influences tend to give the children a keener realization of 
the importance of books. Extensive voluntary reading with 
considerable latitude for choice is dependent upon insuring 
in some way a fresh current of inviting material. This sort 
of reading also requires that some time be provided when 
children may handle and examine books, make trials for 
themselves, and settle down in a comfortable spot to enjoy 
the chosen book. 
When the essentials just mentioned have been provided — 
suitable books, a free period for choice, and right physical 
conditions for reading, it remains for the teacher to devise 
ways of knowing how effectively the children read the books 
chosen. The “Library Hour” or “Book Club” (as de-  
-P-A-G-E-263

scribed in Chapter VI) reveal a good deal. At such times 
the teacher watches and notes-earefully the manner of silent 
reading on the part of individuals; she asks a child to read 
part of a story to her; she makes notes of children who are 
attempting books which are too difficult as well as those who 
remain on too low a level. The children also are encouraged

One of the best ways to stimulate a desire to read as well as to encourage the exercise of 
developing powers is to furnish a quiet comfortable corner and a good collection of books. 
to keep simple records of their reading. These records may 
be in the form of a card file, each child placing a slip in the 
file next to his name card, giving the title of the book he is 
reading with the date when begun and the date when fin- 
ished. A still simpler record is in the form of a large wall 
chart blocked off into as many spaces as there are children 
intheroom. Here the teacher writes or prints in the proper 
space the titles of all books as the readers report their com- 
pletion. This chart usually has some pleasing and suitable 
decoration applied by the pupils and some such heading as, 
Books I Have Reap.

With classes of ordinary size it will be impossible for the 
teacher to verify all these statements and to test all volun- 
tary reading for comprehension and appreciation, but all who 
are doing this kind of work agree that a generous amount 
of informal testing is necessary in order to be sure that good 
habits are being established. To this end a good plan is to 
prepare for each of the most important books a short series 
of leading questions. When a child reports that he has 
finished one of these books, the teacher at the earliest op- 
portunity tries him out with the proper set of questions. In 
most cases the questions should be answered orally in a quick 
interview between teacher and child. Unlike the thought 
questions on Pinocchio which were intended to deepen 
understanding and appreciation, these are of a kind which 
can be answered in a few words by any child who has really 
read the book. 
Below is a convenient form which may be multigraphed 
and kept ready for such tests, a separate sheet for each book. 
By checking the questions as a child replies, the teacher can 
judge how successful he has been in his independent reading. 
She will then be better prepared to guide his future reading.

  CHAPTER XII 
HOW SHALL LITERATURE BE SELECTED AND USED? 
Lireraturs is the most universally accessible of all the great 
arts. It may seem difficult if not impossible to give all chil- 
dren a full introduction to the best in music, painting, sculp- . 
ture, dancing, and the drama, but a little enterprise and 
determination will secure for them the wealth of the ages in 
story and verse. There is just ground for complaint that 
our primary schools in many respects are poorly equipped 
and that superior teachers are greatly handicapped by lack 
of suitable materials and apparatus, but in the matter of 
literature a little money and a little effort command so much 
that there is no excuse for an impoverished curriculum. 
Probably there is no subject in the usual elementary course 
of study which has been so greatly and so generally im- 
proved in recent years as that of literature. Trained libra- 
rians and literary people as well as specialists in childhood 
education have codperated, editors and publishers have 
made available quantities of excellent books at relatively 
low cost, and steady progress has been made in training 
teachers to use this material effectively. 
Not only is literature the most universally accessible of the 
arts, it is also the most universally understood and appre- 
ciated. Because it employs the language of daily life and 
because this language is used clearly and simply in all great 
literature, the immature can be reached by it and can catch 
its deepest message more fully than through any other art 
expression. Music often stirs deep feeling and desire, but 
for most people these responses are vague and indefinite. 
A beautiful picture catches a single fine conception, a single 
culminating moment in an experience, and the sensitive or
-P-A-G-E-268
256 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
gifted get a complete and satisfying message from it. But 
considering all classes, all stages of development, all degrees 
of native ability, probably literature conveys the clearest 
meaning, affords the greatest delight. 
We used to talk about stories and the story hour in the 
kindergarten and primary grades. It is well that these 
terms are rapidly disappearing in favor of the term literature 
as expressive of one great division of the curriculum. The 
latter term at once limits, defines, and dignifies what is to be 
offered. Applied intelligently and consistently, it excludes 
all that is cheap, trivial, and evanescent. 
When we speak of selecting literature for the youngest 
children, we imply that this great realm of human inherit- 
ance is to be opened up to the children, and that from the 
earliest days in school they are to set their feet in a path 
which may lead steadily to college or university work in 
English literature. At least we indicate that the humblest 
citizen shall have a chance to taste of the best and finest 
which books have to offer. Poor adaptations and mutilated 
versions of fine tales, home-made verse, manufactured sto- 
ries devised to convey special lessons — all these must give 
way when we set out to plan a rich course in literature for 
our schools, beginning with the kindergarten. 
Does this sound pretentious and stilted? Does it suggest 
that children are to be fed upon an over-refined and too 
narrowly prescribed literary diet? If so, we have only to 
remember that the best in literature is usually the simplest 
and most direct, and that human thought and feeling have 
expressed themselves in an infinite variety of literary forms 
suited to all stages of mental life. Among these myriad 
forms, the old folk-rhymes and folk-tales are peculiarly well 
suited to the tastes and needs of the younger children.

SELECTION AND USE OF LITERATURE 257 
Moruer Gooss ts THE First Book or PoEtRY AND THE 
a First Book or KNOWLEDGE 
To recognize Mother Goose as literature is to take these old 
verses out of the purely nonsense, doggerel class where the 
unthinking have catalogued them and give them the place 
of dignity and worth which they deserve. So much has been 
written by competent critics setting forth the many merits 
of this old folk-verse that it might seem useless to discuss 
the subject further were it not for one fact. There is a 
strong and persistent tendency to formalize every subject 
and every activity as soon as great school systems adopt 
them; and folk-literature, including Mother Goose, seems in 
danger of being swallowed up by the one engulfing purpose 
of teaching children to read. It has become a very popular 
material for the first reading lessons, and in many classes 
the children’s acquaintancy with Mother Goose is limited to 
the selections which find their way into primers. Percival 
Chubb has pointed out eloquently and on many occasions 
the fundamental nature and value of the old songs, rhymes, 
ballads, and fragments of popular verse which have for over 
two hundred years appeared in various collections called 
Mother Goose Rhymes. In his lecture on “The Child as a 
Literary Personage,” ! he says: 
We have misunderstood literature — literature is more and more 
a thing of the eye for us; less and less a thing of the ear. This 
means that it is less and less a social interest, more and more a 
matter of individual and solitary enjoyment. We are corrupted 
by print, the victims of the cold black-and-white of the printed 
page. Literature through the ages has not been this; it has lived 
in the auditory memory and been transmitted by the voice. It 
has been a joy for the ear and the auditory’s imagination. I, for 
one, would have it so still, especially the traditionary literature

of childhood. ... The child as a literary personage demands the 
literature of associated activity, in the composite forms of early 
literature; a literature of song, which is sung, of story which is em> 
bellished with musical values; of action which is acted. 
It is no mere metaphor to say that Mother Goose should be 
the child’s first ““Book of Knowledge,” his first ‘‘ Natural 
History,” his “Introduction to Sociology.”” Examine care- 
fully any authentic and full collection of these old verses. A 
marvelous procession of human characters crosses the pages. 
The whole of society (the society of Old England at least) - 
is assembled there in miniature — kings, queens, squires, 
ladies, farmers, shepherds, blacksmiths, cobblers, priests, 
fishermen, milkmaids, lady’s-maids, stable-boys — all in a 
jolly, democratic cameraderie. They work and dance, laugh 
and mourn, hold converse together or go their several ways. 
And these ways lead into every kind of environment. We 
enter palace and hut, court and kitchen, church, market, 
shop, fair, mill, and inn; we visit city, village, farm, garden, 
seashore, lane, field, and stream; we dine upon bread, honey, 
milk, roast beef, fish, tarts, butter, cheese, pie, cake, and 
nuts, either sitting in state with King Cole or sharing a pre- 
carious supper with Tommy Tucker. 
Mingled with this human procession or taking their way 
at their own pace and gait, what an assemblage of animals 
and birds! Notice how rare a thing in Mother Goose is a 
purely fabricated beast like the unicorn. With scarcely an 
exception the animals are the familiar domestic ones, and 
bird-life is represented by barnyard fowls and the most 
common birds of field and woodland. Babies and young 
city children may meet for the first time in the pages of 
Mother Goose some of the fascinating living creatures gath- 
ered there; cows, calves, sheep, lambs, horses, ponies, colts, 
and donkeys appear. Usually they play their ordinary but 
fascinating réles as adjuncts to the normal life of man. Only 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
SELECTION AND USE OF LITERATURE 259 
one cow jumps over the moon, and only one dog is known to 
have laughed visibly and audibly. Little children need not 
get distorted, erroneous ideas of the world about them from 
good old Mother Goose. There is a laugh on every page, but 
how much sanity and wisdom as well! Many story-rhymes 
are pure realism without a touch of the fantastic and im- 
possible, but presented picturesquely, vividly, and with de- 
licious humor. Such stories as Boy Blue, Baa, Baa, Black 
Sheep, Miss Muffet, Jack Horner, Jack and Jill, Simple 
. Simon, Lucy Locket, Polly Flinders, I had a Little Pony, 
Dance to your Daddy, Bye, Baby Bunting, and a score of 
others, seem perfectly sensible and plausible. They are 
leaves right out of the book of child-life, and present a 
graphic record of the small joys, woes, accidents, escapades, 
folly, and wisdom of genuine child characters. 
Tn this first “‘ Book of Knowledge” we learn about making 
cake, shoeing horses, milking cows, shearing sheep, making 
cheese and butter, planting and reaping, grinding flour, fish- 
ing, tending garden, tending geese and chickens, washing 
clothes, bathing and dressing the baby, and a multitude of 
other homely tasks and industries. 
Every kindergarten and every first and second grade 
should possess at least one excellent illustrated collection of 
Mother Goose. Good pictures add immensely to the value 
and delight of these rhymes, and proof of their essential 
charm and vitality is shown in the ‘almost unprecedented 
array of superior artists who have been impelled to use their 
gifts in depicting the characters and scenes. Ralph Calde- 
cott, Walter Crane, Kate Greenaway, Walter Rackham, 
Leslie Brooke, and other highly skilled artists have given en- 
hanced humor, beauty, and meaning by their delightful il- 
lustrations, and so far as possible all children should have 
the benefit of their work. 
Not only is there much of sound sense in Mother Goose; 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
260 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
there are also verses of great beauty. There are a few ex- 
amples of fine lyrics which not only have the lilt and swing 
belonging to the type, but exhibit also the other essential — 
beautiful poetic conceptions. Among these may be cited, 
The North Wind doth Blow, I saw a Ship A-Sailing, My Maid 
Mary, Bless you, Bless you, Burnie Bee, and Rock-a-bye, 
Baby, Thy Cradle is Green. 
Children should know some of these nursery songs in the 
beautiful musical setting given by Elliot, Le Mair,?and others. 
For younger children Mother Goose rhymes serve as ad- 
mirable material for free, spontaneous, original dramatic 
representation. The plots are exceedingly simple, the dia- 
logue brief or absent altogether, and the characters are so 
sharply drawn that little children can easily originate a. 
dramatic representation closely akin to pantomime. Later, 
the powers of more mature and experienced pupils may have 
exercise in such a small drama as The Queen of Hearts, which 
requires several scenes to develop its fully rounded plot of 
“complication, climax, dénouement.” A little more dia- 
logue must be evolved, and there is ample opportunity for 
imagination to work creatively in depicting court life, man- 
ners, costumes, etc. 
Here again we may deplore the present tendency, which 
is to dramatize these little stories solely as an adjunct to the 
reading lesson. When so used, esthetic and creative quali- 
ties drop out entirely, for pupils must do the scene “just so,” 
must say the lines ‘“‘just so,” in order to make action and 
words fit the exact mould laid down by manual and demon- 
strator. Deviation is to be avoided (say some advocates 
of particular reading methods) because changed order or 
omitted phrases will lead to confusion when pupils attempt 
to read the elaborated story as it appears in the primer. If

-P-A-G-E-273
  SELECTION AND USE OF LITERATURE 261 
this procedure must be followed, we should at least give the 
children a freer rein by letting them dramatize many rhymes 
not contained in the readers. 
What a pity it is to reduce this rich and charming world 
of song in primary grades to five or six selections thought to 
be especially well adapted to early practice and drill lessons 
in reading. Not only is this much too meager in amount, 
but the use of any literary material almost exclusively to im- 
part the rudiments of reading technique practically insures 
that the characteristic intrinsic charm of the material will be 
sacrificed. Let us continue to use folk-verses and folk-tales 
as part of our reading matter for beginners, but let us see to 
it that they have also a full and delightful acquaintance with 
much that is beyond their ability to read. 
Suspecting that general acquaintance with folk-verse is 
limited to about a dozen well-known titles, we tested a group 
of kindergarten-primary teachers to see what titles came 
most prominently to mind. Without previous warning and 
without recent reading or study of Mother Goose, ninety- 
seven young women taking a course in children’s literature 
were asked to write down as rapidly as possible titles, or any 
identifying line, of Mother Goose rhymes in the order in 
which they came into their minds. They were given just 
two minutes in which to write. 
The results of this experiment in brief were as follows: 
The largest number of titles given by any one was fourteen, 
the smallest was two. The total number of different rhymes 
named was one hundred and five. The frequency with 
which certain titles were mentioned ranged from one to fifty- 
one, the rhymes which were listed by fifty per cent of the 
class being Miss Muffet and Jack and Jill, with fifty-one 
“votes” each, and Boy Blue, with fifty out of a possible 
ninety-seven. Jack Horner was just below the fifty per cent 
mark, being found on forty-six lists.

  SELECTION AND USE OF LITERATURE 263 
It does not necessarily follow that more verse of this sort 
should be included in textbooks for beginners in reading. 
The figures are offered here to show that the notion that 
primary pupils in general are getting a full acquaintance with 
this material through their readers is erroneous. Mother 
Goose is the child’s first classic, and should be presented as 
worth while in itself, in a reasonably full collection, well 
bound and well illustrated. 
ACQUAINTANCE WITH FoLk-TALES THROUGH TEXTBOOKS 
In READING Is NoT SUFFICIENT 
There is some danger that the choicest folk- and fairy- 
tales will be known to pupils in the lower grades only through 
impoverished versions which have been reduced to a vocabu- 
lary and a style suited to primers and first readers. This is 
not intended as a criticism of textbooks which contain these 
much-simplified stories, but is mentioned as the basis of a 
plea for giving children orally the very best versions of these 
stories and many others of the same type. The very excel- 
lence of some of these books as reading texts may cause 
teachers to overlook the necessity of offering a rich course in 
literature for its own sake. So much time may be spent on 
The Little Red Hen, Chicken Little, etc., as material for teach- 
ing reading, that the teacher will fail to give orally an abun- 
dance of equally good stories in better literary form. 
Some systems of teaching reading require the verbatim 
memorization of stories as they appear in the text. Teach- 
ers are expected to tell these stories in the staccato sentences 
of the primer. Even kindergarten teachers, in an effort to 
“prepare” for reading, sometimes limit themselves in story- 
telling to the particular versions which will be encountered 
later in beginning reading. This seems an unduly restrictive 
and narrowly utilitarian policy. These simple, delightful 
old tales lend themselves admirably to the early steps in ac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
    264 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
quiring the art of reading, but teachers need to be careful to 
present them also orally through reading to the class or tell- 
ing them in the best obtainable versions. 
Another result due to the tendency to subordinate litera~ 
ture to skill in reading is the overuse of the accumulative 
tale in the lower grades. In teaching reading, there is a 
peculiar advantage in employing such stories as The Old 
Woman and her Pig, The Little Red Hen, The Gingerbread 
Boy, The Cat that Lost her Tail, etc. There is, of course, in- 
trinsic charm in such stories for young children, and they 
should become acquainted in one way or another with many 
of the best of this type. But there is no excuse for using this 
one pattern to such excess. It tends to keep children too 
long on an exceedingly obvious and chain-like form of plot, 
when they are quite mature enough intellectually to follow 
with understanding and delight stories having a somewhat 
more complex organization. They should have many folk- 
and fairy-tales of a type providing greater variety of events, 
with a less fortuitous and arbitrary sequence, with charac- 
ters in more natural relation to each other. The thinking 
and the memorization called for in accumulative tales are 
based upon associations of the simplest, most obvious sort. 
In the “chain” story, one name and one event touch off by 
association another name, another event, in a mental process 
much like that involved in reciting the A, B, C’s, whereas 
stories like Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, The House in the 
Wood, The Frog Prince, The Elves and the Shoemakers, while 
constructed on simple dramatic lines, have different struc- 
tural patterns. Mastery of such tales requires richer and 
more varied associations, since appreciation and recall must 
be secured through much more complete thought-processes. 
Textbooks beyond the first reader, and even a few for that 
grade, contain to-day a wealth of these fine old tales in really 
excellent form. A goodly number of texts with their de-
-P-A-G-E-277
SELECTION AND USE OF LITERATURE 265 
lightful illustrations may be thought of as genuine story- 
books. But we should have also in the classroom collections 
of folk-tales never meant to be used as textbooks. Children 
should have an opportunity to handle and know intimately 
such books as Leslie Brooke’s ! The Three Pigs, The Golden 
Goose Book, and Johnny Crow’s Garden; and Valery Car- 
rick’s Picture Tales from the Russian. The stories in such 
books are not reduced to terms suited for beginners’ own 
reading, but they are admirably adapted to stimulating the 
desire to read, and they furnish the teacher with excellent 
versions of some of the old tales in language and style ap- 
propriate to read aloud to young pupils. For the reading 
of more advanced primary pupils there is an abundance of 
folk- and fairy-tales in beautiful illustrated editions as well 
as in the best textbooks. This phase of the subject is dis- 
cussed in Chapter XI. 
Reauistic SToRIES ARE NEEDED 
The fact that such a very large percentage of the subject- 
matter of primary reading texts consists of folk-tales makes 
it the more important that the children be furnished through 
other channels with a varied program in literature. Few 
students of the subject would question the importance and 
fitness of fairy-tales in a course in literature for the primary 
school, but, although most children delight in such stories, 
they have also a lively interest in “‘true” stories. Too much 
weight has been attached to the commonly accepted dictum 
that interest in fairy-tales culminates at about the age of 
seven or eight years. Too little attention has been given to 
another line of interest exhibited by practically all children 
from a very early age — their delight in narratives dealing 
with the daily life of real people, young and old, of to-day 
and yesterday.

-P-A-G-E-278
  266 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Without special effort, the offering in realistic stories will 
be too scant. There are relatively fewer stories of real life 
in children’s books to-day than in those of fifty years ago, 
though what do appear are better in literary quality, less 
goody-goody, and unnatural. Because so few stories of this 
type are found in books intended for children to read and 
because they are so difficult for teachers to find for telling, it 
is safe to assert that the masses of children in school up to, 
and including, third grade, are getting very little fiction that 
does not involve more or less of the supernatural element. 
Too rarely do they have an opportunity to follow an inter- 
esting plot with real child characters, with setting and inci- 
dents true to life, developed with the fine imagination, taste, 
and skill of a literary artist. For primary grades there seems 
to be comparatively little that corresponds in character and 
quality with the offerings for older children, such as The 
Secret Garden, Little Lord Fauntleroy, Understood Betsey, The 
Prince and the Pauper, and Tom Sawyer. 
Teachers should search through collections for good real- 
istic stories to tell, should read aloud longer and more diffi- 
cult ones, and should place in the children’s hands as soon as 
possible such complete wholes as All About Johnnie Jones, 
About Harriet; When Molly was Six; The Eskimo Twins; The 
Dutch Twins; Wee Ann; and The Snow Baby. 
Closely related to this class of stories and offering similar 
values are animal stories which might be true. By this, it is 
intended to distinguish them from the fairy-tale kind where 
animal characters talk, dress, and behave like human beings 
and have a disconcerting way of changing form and nature 
at their convenience. We shall disregard here the ‘“‘nature- 
fakir” controversy. The children’s library should include, 
of course, the most reliable and authoritative references re- 
garding animals, birds, and insects, but there is no need to 
press too vigorously the exactions of science when discussing
-P-A-G-E-279
  SELECTION AND USE OF LITERATURE 267 
literature. Surely there should be no hesitation in including 
fine stories in which animals are the leading characters and 
which are so written as to seem true to life to all readers ex- 
cept the most mature, experienced, and scientifically trained. 
Primary children should make the acquaintance of Raggylug, 
Johnny Bear, Krag, Moufflou, and Black Beauty — not as 
vehicles for conveying instruction in nature-lore, but as 
worthy examples of a type of fiction which appeals strongly 
to a dominant interest of the young and to sympathies which 
we wish to encourage. 
Mopern Fancirut TALES SHOULD BE SELECTED WITH 
Esprciat Care 
The term fanciful tale is one often used to designate a large 
group of stories written in comparatively recent times as dis-- 
tinguished from the old anonymous folk- and fairy-tales 
which were “the product of the ages.” The term is a com- 
prehensive one sometimes loosely applied to all modern 
stories for children which are not strictly realistic or his- 
torical in character. Vast numbers of these stories have 
been published, and they are of all degrees of worth from 
zero to a quality which stamps them as genuine classics. 
The quantity is suspiciously voluminous, and that fact alone 
warns us to examine carefully into the quality of the product. 
An outstanding trait of the great mass of these tales is 
their lack of balance and restraint. They employ many of 
the supernatural agencies and characters of the old tales — 
giants, fairies, elves, gnomes, ete. — and attempt to work 
their magic in similar ways, but there is a tendency to pile 
marvel upon marvel, to resort to the freakish and fantastic, 
the bizarre and preposterous. Many critics have pointed 
out that, while the old fairy-tale employs just enough magic 
to enable their very natural human characters to win out in 
their endeavors, many modern fairy-tales set no limit upon
-P-A-G-E-280
268 ‘THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
  the use of the supernatural. They have consequently little 
of the sincerity of the old tales, and rarely touch the emo- 
tions in any way except through the occasional appeal to a 
sense of humor. Most of these stories furnish only a mo- 
mentary amusement. They are marked by the sophisti- 
cated inventiveness of their authors rather than by the 
creative imagination necessary to a real art product. In- 
volved plot and inconsequential incidents make them diffi- 
cult to follow, while intended symbolic import frequently 
further obscures whatever direct meaning the story might 
have. Quite often they are written in an attempt to convey 
a specific moral lesson or to carry propaganda of some sort, 
such as health, thrift, patriotism, and these purposes become 
paramount. Real literature is not created that way. 
In searching for excellence in the great mass of fanciful 
tales, the novice at the task continues hopeful for some time 
that there will come to light true counterparts of such old 
favorites as Goldilocks, Sleeping Beauty, Jack and the Bean 
Stalk, or Hansel and Grethel, but that is vain. Modern 
writers cannot satisfactorily imitate these old models nor can 
they create new tales in the old spirit. Both mould and pre- 
cious mixture are irrecoverable. 
We must not expect, then, that the modern tale will be 
really so like the old fairy-story that any intelligent person 
will be deceived. Neither should we judge them for their 
unlikeness to a type which they can never closely approxi- 
mate and which the best writers seldom attempt to copy. 
It would be a mistake to let the strictures of adult judges 
deprive the child of to-day of the stories of to-day because 
many of them seem rather trivial and ephemeral. They be- 
long in a class by themselves and have their own style and 
charm. 
The best have many elements of peculiar beauty and de- 
light. Their greater length and complexity is an advantage
-P-A-G-E-281
  SELECTION AND USE OF LITERATURE 269 
when we consider the more mature children. Such stories 
as The Little Lame Prince, Pinocchio, The Adventures of a 
Brownie, The Bluebird, The Story of Dr. Dolittle, call for more 
sustained interest because of a more elaborate plot worked 
out with many surprises and with a wealth of charming in- 
cidents and whimsical invention on the part of the authors. 
The characters are followed through greater stretches of 
time and space, through a greater variety of experiences, and 
the child audience is thus prepared for the tales of adventure 
and romance of a later period. In the old folk-tales there is 
rarely any change in the nature and conduct of the charac- 
ters; they are usually very, very good or very, very bad at 
the beginning, and this they continue to the end. The im- 
pact of experience, the influence of other natures, have no 
effect upon them. Modern fairy-tales have as a rule more 
gradation of light and shade. Since the characters are not 
tagged so unmistakably as good or bad, readers must judge 
and discriminate more as regards motive and conduct. The 
whole nature of the leading character may undergo a change 
in the progress of the story by reason of the situations and 
reactions portrayed, as in Lorenzini’s Pinocchio and Selma 
Lagerléf’s The Wonderful Adventures of Nils. 
The moral issues of folk-lore are exceedingly fundamental 
in character, involving as a rule such questions as courage, 
truth-telling, justice, filial duty, obedience, and industry. 
Modern fairy-tales also often center about such issues, but 
perhaps more frequently the ethical questions are less basic, 
less deeply rooted in human conduct, and more concerned 
with such qualities as contentment, kindness, politeness, 
good temper, unselfishness in small matters, etc. These 
issues are not to be despised provided the story is developed 
in such manner as to present the theme in a balanced and 
artistic way. For the life of to-day is different from that of 
primitive times, and there are themes of interest and mean- 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  270 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
ing to children which may not have been so significant in a 
less complex world. 
A few exceptionally fine stories for the youngest children 
have appeared in very small volumes. Among the best are 
Little Black Sambo, by Helen Bannerman; and the beloved 
Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin, by Beatrix Potter. Books 
of pinafore-pocket size attract in pinafore days, but it.takes 
something more than small dimensions and “cunning” pic- 
tures to make a good book for infant minds. 
There can be no question as to the popularity of stories of 
animals dressed up and comporting themselves as human 
beings. The keen native interest of children in animal life 
accounts in part for this popularity, and the illustrations are 
as a rule clever and amusing. Then actions which would 
be quite commonplace if people were the characters seem 
unique and exciting when performed by ducks, pigs, foxes, 
bears, and rabbits. It would seem to the careful observer 
that better stories are likely to be submerged by the great 
output of cheap tales of this kind. The newspapers are full 
of them, and new writers of this type seem to spring up over- 
night. The children’s native liking should not be ignored, 
but certainly some moderation in selection should be prac- 
ticed. A few of the Beatrix Potter books, a few of Gelett 
Burgess’s, and single choice stories such as Perez the Mouse, 
adapted by Lady Moreton, and Rae’s Grasshopper Green and 
the Meadow Mice, would perhaps furnish enough good ex- 
amples of this class until the children are ready for that 
wonderful characterization of animal life, Kenneth Gra- 
hame’s The Wind in the Willows. 
A Taste ror Moprern VERSE SHOULD BE CULTIVATED 
While there is comparatively little verse for average kin- 
dergarten and beginning first grade which fits the tastes, 
interests, and emotional reactions of the period as well as
-P-A-G-E-283
  SELECTION AND USE OF LITERATURE Q71 
Mother Goose, we should be on the alert to discover for these 
years bits of suitable song and poetry from modern writers. 
The Peter Patter Book, by Leroy F. Jackson, contains delight- 
ful verse quite in the spirit and style of the old nonsense 
rhymes. Here and there from the pen of well-known au- 
thors have come bits of verse very like folk-rhyme. They 
are characterized by simple, naive conceits, pictured vividly, 
expressed rhythmically, and brought to completion in the 
smallest possible compass. Laura Richards and Christina 
Rossetti furnish many examples of this kind, and Stevenson’s 
Time to Rise, Rain, and Singing are familiar illustrations. 
Walter De la Mare’s A Child’s Day presents the simplest 
everyday experiences in pleasing rhyme, and in his collec- 
tion called Peacock Pie there are several poems as perfect as 
they are brief which quite young children greatly enjoy. 
Delightfully childlike and naive in conception are the little 
poems bearing the titles Alas, Alack; The Bandog; and Bread 
and Cherries. 
A step at a time children should be introduced to less frag- 
mentary, less concrete verse. We should help them by de- 
grees to discover the pleasure to be found in poetry calling 
for greater imagination, for less obvious association of ideas. 
It is well at every stage to present some poetry which is 
likely to appeal by sheer music of meter and language. 
While there is something very elemental in the appeal of 
poetry, higher intellectual responses also are called for in all 
but the simplest nursery rhymes. Increasing mastery of 
language is demanded, since poetry brings the added diffi- 
culties of inversion, elision, figures of speech, and unaccus- 
tomed phrasing. Knowledge which comes from experience 
is required. Poetry does not deal with airy nothings; it pre- 
sents the familiar world about us in an idealized way, 
searches out hidden meanings and relations which the aver- 
age person sees dimly or not at all, and presents these in a 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  272 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
fresh and arresting manner. It follows that the more one 
has truly experienced, the better he is prepared to enjoy the 
pictures and interpretations of the poet. 
It is true, as has been so often said, that children are nat- 
ural poets; that they are in the mythopceic stage which 
causes them to offer naive and often beautiful explanations 
of the puzzling phenomena about them. They turn inani- 
mate objects into sentient beings; appearance becomes 
reality; terms and attributes of the familiar and known are 
applied to the strange and unfamiliar; there is an easy sub- 
stitution of one object for another similar in some respect. 
Flowers are children to be tended; tall weeds are giants to be 
destroyed; the setting sun is a red balloon; hailstones are 
little marbles which got spilled; elder blossoms are parasols. 
But this tendency on the part of children to offer spontane- 
ous and naive interpretation does not necessarily insure that 
they can enter into the poetic conceptions of an adult mind 
regarding the same event or fact. A young child may quite 
spontaneously call the stars “little holes in the floor of 
heaven,” or may think they are ‘lanterns which the angels 
hang out’’; but this is no proof that he will be able at that 
time to shift to Frank Dempster Sherman’s beautiful con- 
ceptions in his poem Daisies, in which he speaks of the stars 
as “daisies white that dot the meadow of the night”; the 
moon, a lady fair who 
« “... picked them all 
And dropped them down, 
Into the meadows of the town.” 
Later the child may be able to play freely with different 
fanciful ideas regarding life about him, catch charming fan- 
cies from others, and perhaps weave these with his own into 
new patterns, but we need to be careful not to submerge him 
with mythic, poetic ideas while he is still groping after a few
-P-A-G-E-285
  SELECTION AND USE OF LITERATURE 278 
salient truths regarding the complex world which he has so 
recently come to inhabit. It is only after we have a dim 
notion of what stars and moon really are, and have seen 
daisy fields under just the right aspect, that we can enter 
with full delight into the charming story which the poet 
unfolds. 
In introducing children to the realm of poetry, great gaps 
have too often been left. They have been allowed to stum- 
ble along with too little guidance, apparently in the belief 
that some are natural poetry-lovers who will find their own 
way in good time and that others never will care for poetry 
anyway. 
Judicious selection and intelligent grading are essential if 
the world of beautiful poetry is to be opened to children. 
Not only should maturity, experience, and temperament be 
considered, but we should distinguish also as regards the 
uses to which the selections are to be put. Some are suitable 
for teacher and pupils to read together for immediate enjoy- 
ment, while other poems might be chosen if one were seeking 
a series of the most appropriate and important for memo- 
rization. 
Well-graded material for the first-named purpose may be 
readily found in numerous excellent collections of poetry for 
children. Titles of such books are given in the Appendix. 
As regards the second purpose, memorization, several ex- 
tensive studies of published curricula have been made for the 
purpose of ascertaining which poems are most frequently 
memorized in our schools. 
We may easily attach too much importance to such lists as 
these. One should not overlook the fact that in making 
curricula there has been a great deal of borrowing not always 
of the most intelligent kind. Hence, it is easy for a certain 
poem or story to appear again and again in courses of study 
for different cities, and for the “frequency” to be very high
-P-A-G-E-286
    Q74 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
when as a matter of fact probably very few well-founded, 
direct, and sincere judgments have been made by those re- 
sponsible. A group of teachers in a given school, knowing 
children well and their own pupils in particular, and having 
an intimate acquaintance with poetry, can make a much 
more satisfactory selection for that school than will be fur- 
nished by any composite list obtainable. We must remem- 
ber that poetry, especially in its higher forms, has not the 
same universal appeal as has a fairy-tale such as Cinderella 
or Puss in Boots. One cannot have the same assurance that 
Stevenson’s The Swing, for example, will be appreciated and 
liked by almost every child in any first grade in any environ- 
ment. For these reasons it is wise to take graded lists of 
poetry compiled for another school or locality as suggestive 
rather than absolute. 
Children should be allowed a great deal of choice ‘as to 
what they will memorize. There are only a very few selec- 
tions of such supreme worth that one can safely say every 
English-speaking child should know them “‘by heart.” Out- 
side of these there are many poems, not differing widely 
from each other so far as literary quality is concerned, but 
exhibiting great variety in mood, content, and form. Con- 
sidering the great individual differences among children 
themselves, it seems poor psychology to determine too 
closely poems for mass memorization. The opportunity to 
choose is one very large element in developing a love of 
poetry and a sound taste as well. There should be much 
reading aloud on the part of the teacher as well as by the 
best readers in the class. In this way the children get a par- 
tial acquaintance with a considerable number of poems of 
various types, and those they choose later for special study 
and memorization will be much more likely to be selected 
because of a genuine interest and liking.

CHAPTER XIV 
IF ARITHMETIC IS A TOOL SUBJECT, WHOSE TOOL 
IS IT? 
ARITHMETIC is quite commonly characterized as a tool sub- 
ject. We are told that its value consists not in any intrinsic 
meaning, but in its serviceability in accomplishing and un- 
derstanding the affairs of life. The old argument that the 
study of arithmetic gives a general mental discipline is in the 
discard. The human race has slowly evolved and organized 
a large body of knowledge and skills called arithmetic which 
it employs to facilitate its labor, its arts, and its social inter- 
change. Is this a tool for children, or does it belong only in 
the equipment of the adult? When, where, and by whom is 
it to be actually used? 
It is safe to say that, in spite of the modern emphasis upon 
social aspects of education, there are still thousands of ele- 
mentary schools in which practically all the arithmetic work 
for six years consists in an attempt to get control over the 
skills involved. If the pupils ever test out their ability to 
apply this knowledge to real affairs, they do it on their own 
initiative outside of school. This is particularly true of the 
primary grades. Often in schools where banking, insurance, 
simple bookkeeping, cooking, and pattern-drafting give 
some vitality and meaning to arithmetic in the upper grades, 
the younger children are required to spend practically their 
entire time on drill in abstractions. Some gain has been 
made in recent years in upper-grade work through the elim- 
ination of processes which are admittedly never used in real 
life, but which were universally found in the older textbooks 
and courses of study; for example, least common multiple, 
greatest common divisor, cube root. Improvement has 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  ARITHMETIC A TOOL SUBJECT 277 
been made also by setting a more reasonable limit to the 
complexity and magnitude of the factors involved in certain 
operations. Because primary arithmetic did not contain 
outworn topics similar to those just mentioned, but has al- 
ways dealt chiefly with the four fundamental operations, it 
has not profited so much by the progressive movement which 
has brought upper-grade work more nearly into line with the 
requirements of everyday life. Yet primary children are 
farther away by several years from the uses which come with 
‘adult participation in trade, manufacture, and accounting, 
and are therefore less able to project themselves into the 
future and apply in imagination what they are trying to 
learn. ‘They are more dependent than the older children 
upon the present utilization of partly formed skills as op- 
portunity offers in school and home life. 
Three or four years (the period usually assigned to pri- 
mary work) is a long time to keep on sharpening, grinding, 
or pointing an unused instrument. If it is seldom or never 
employed for interesting and practical accomplishment and 
its efficiency tested thereby, how can the worker ever learn 
to use it successfully? How can he be sure that his control 
of the tool is satisfactory if he is rarely called upon to handle 
it in any real undertaking? 
There are two kinds of satisfaction in owning a sharp- 
bladed jack-knife. One comes simply from the sense of 
ownership; to feel the knife in the pocket, to admire the 
shining metal, to open and close the blades, to test its keen 
edge by whittling or hacking any piece of wood which comes 
to hand. But soon the owner’s satisfaction takes a more 
specific form, such as carving the initials, shaping a boat, 
cutting and trimming a fishing-rod, and making all manner 
of boyish contrivances. The knife becomes the boy’s most 
valued and indispensable tool without which he would be 
handicapped in a hundred situations that are personally 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
    278 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
important. And as he uses it, he becomes more and more 
expert and sure. In one sense the knife is more his own now 
than when he first acquired it. He seldom sharpens and 
polishes the blades just because a grindstone is at hand, but 
is moved to keep the knife in good shape because it is un- 
satisfactory and annoying to attempt to cut and carve with 
a dull, nicked, and rusty knife. From childhood to man- 
hood he continues at times to whittle idly at any tempting 
piece of wood, but this is decidedly a minor satisfaction as 
compared with the realization of desired ends. 
Is it pushing the metaphor too far to attempt to apply the 
psychology of the jack-knife to the mastery of arithmetic? 
Of course reasoning by analogy is often fallacious, but if 
arithmetic is meant to be a serviceable tool, it seems both 
logical and necessary to inquire to what extent and at what 
stage we may expect it to function. It is fair also to ask 
whether adequate mastery can be attained without constant 
and genuine application of facts and processes. 
Have First-Grape Curnpren any User ror ArirHMeric? 
The question as to whether arithmetic shall be taught in 
first grade has been much discussed. Varying answers with 
resulting policies have almost always been based upon such 
considerations as maturity of the pupils, the difficulty of the 
subject, and economy of time. Are first-grade children 
ready to deal with new symbols and master the facts? Do 
the results justify the amount of time spent upon the sub- 
ject in this grade? Occasionally these questions are raised 
with regard to second grade also. Will the children not’ be 
just as far along at the end of the third year if the subject is 
postponed for a year or two? One very seldom hears the 
questions, ‘“‘Do six- and seven-year-old children need some 
knowledge of number and measure in order to carry on their 
affairs satisfactorily? Will it help them to understand and
-P-A-G-E-291
  ARITHMETIC A TOOL SUBJECT 279 
get control over their own world?” Whether these young 
children truly need some arithmetic in their school life de- 
pends upon the character of that life. Where passivity on 
the part of pupils is the rule, where receptivity is all that is 
asked, there can be no immediate need for number. Com- 
putation is called for only in connection with active affairs. 
Whenever people are in close active association, living to- 
gether in social relationships, forming and executing indi- 
vidual and group plans, simple computations are always 
necessary. This is particularly true when materials are 
variously employed and where responsibility is shared. 
It sounds paradoxical, but it is certainly true that more 
knowledge of arithmetic is really needed during school hours 
by children in a fairly good kindergarten than in a formal 
traditional second grade. The former are actively engaged 
all day in work and play. They are handling a variety of ma- 
terials and fitting them to a variety of ends, and wherever 
such activity is going on, concepts of magnitude, quantity, 
and relation are constantly called for. In the formal second 
grade which we have in mind the children sit still and do 
nothing; there is not a scrap of material to do with; they are 
out of touch completely with the real child-world of work 
and play. It is obviously impossible for any genuine need 
for computation to arise here. 
It seems strange that just when a strong movement had 
started toward providing for a more active program and a 
richer curriculum in primary grades, more play and games, 
more industrial arts work, more excursions, more pupil re- 
sponsibility in class organization, there arose a disposition 
to cut out arithmetic altogether from first-grade work. 
Through these realities of child-life the school has for the 
first time a chance to make arithmetic purposeful, effective, 
and genuinely concrete. Only in the newer type of primary 
school can the children grasp and use arithmetic as a nec- 
essary and valuable tool. .
-P-A-G-E-292
    280 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
It is to be feared that, where arithmetic has been dropped 
out of early primary work, it has often been done in order 
that, through the postponement of one kind of arduous drill, 
time may be found for more drill in another subject. The 
mechanics of reading will consume all the time that can be 
saved elsewhere if those directing the work do not keep a 
sense of relative values. Suzzallo ! says: 
... It is a fairly general opinion that the arithmetic should not 
be thrown upon the school beginner along with the other heavy 
burden of learning to read. Learning the mechanics of reading is 
quite the most important part of the first school year, and the ad- 
dition of the difficulties of another language, for such number is, 
would be to overburden and distract the child. Hence a common- 
sense distribution of burdens and tasks, regardless of questions of 
child maturity, would delay the formal and systematic study of 
arithmetic a half or whole school year, little reliance being placed 
upon previous “incidental” acquisition. 
There is abundant evidence that young children are quite 
as interested in number as in reading. In the very early 
stages it is perhaps a more universal interest. It seems 
probable also that in one way or another most children 
touch upon the quantitative side of life before entering 
school more than they do upon the reading art, and that 
they “pick up”’ more knowledge along the former line. It 
is a well-known fact among primary teachers that many 
children entering first grade from the kindergarten and from 
the home come with a fair start in the rudiments of arith- 
metic. Failure to utilize and develop this knowledge seems 
to be justified only where the time saved is devoted to the 
richer content subjects. Reading in childhood is, of course, 
more important than arithmetic, because it opens up the 
rich world of literature and also because it is needed in such 
1Suzzallo, Henry: The Teaching of Primary Arithmetic, chap. tv, p. 37.

-P-A-G-E-293
  ARITHMETIC A TOOL SUBJECT 281 
a large part of the other school work beyond second grade. 
We are simply urging that the first two years in school 
shall not be given over so completely to forcing this subject 
to the detriment of almost everything else. If independ- 
ence and self-help are to be encouraged in manual arts, in 
games, and in keeping records; if responsibility is called for 
in care of materials, in other schoolroom housekeeping and 
in running errands; and if ideas of thrift are to be offectively 
implanted, then some arithmetic must be well taught fairly 
early. Furthermore, certain phases of the subject can be 
more successfully taught in these situations than in any 
other way. 
Wuat ts Mnant By INcIDENTAL TEACHING OF 
ARITHMETIC? 
The answer which we make to this question determines 
whether the method so designated shall be considered com- 
mendable or reprehensible. Do we mean by incidental 
teaching that chance bits of knowledge and skill are to be 
picked up at random out of a mass of experience, to be noted 
and used to-day and neglected to-morrow? Does the term 
signify that there is no conscious plan looking toward definite 
accomplishment, that the whole procedure is about as scat- 
tered as is the number experience most children have out of 
school? No doubt a good deal of practice has justified this 
conception; but the term is often misapplied to a much more 
definite and orderly plan. Any procedure which does not 
follow a fixed and logical order, which turns aside to utilize 
immediate experience of a quantitative sort even though it 
may not fall readily into an established system, is by some 
people designated as incidental. 
The term is a poor one, and its disrepute has hindered the 
movement to make arithmetic more useful and interesting 
io children.
-P-A-G-E-294
282 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Applied arithmetic more truly describes the kind of 
number work which should be provided abundantly and 
with careful, intelligent forethought. Such planning means 
that all who have to do with making the curriculum, and 
especially the grade teachers, will make a thorough study 
in advance of those opportunities for suitable number work 
most likely to arise through the enriched program of the 
school. They will provide a greater number of natural 
situations where counting, learning to read and write num- 
bers, addition combinations, simple measuring, and buying 
and selling in small values are called for in first and second 
grade. In third grade a few situations at least will be dis- 
covered where building up the multiplication tables and the 
necessary memorization will be stimulated by some real 
need. Every unit of work of any scope, whether initiated 
by children or teacher, will be scrutinized by her to see 
whether there are not valuable arithmetical features which 
will be neglected unless she definitely plans to make the 
most of them. ‘Making the most of them” ought not to 
mean the exaggeration out of all proportion of the mathe- 
matical elements so that the main purpose is dwarfed or 
forgotten. One should not in the desire to teach arithmetic 
spoil an excursion, kill a birthday celebration, overload toy- 
making to the breaking point, or convert a good game into a 
stupid, tiresome exercise. Balance and sincerity are called 
for, and one must keep in view the ideal of helping children 
to understand and use arithmetic in just the ways that life 
demands. 
Wuat is THE Practicat Import or THE PHRASE 
“BEGIN WITH THE CONCRETE”? 
To observe the old tenet, “Begin with the concrete,” one 
must begin with some matter that has meaning and sig- 
nificance to the child so that he really cares about the results 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  ARITHMETIC A TOOL SUBJECT 283 
of the calculations. Any other basis is more or less abstract. 
It has been pointed out by Dr. Dewey and others that 
things present to the senses, objects which we can see, 
touch, and handle, are not necessarily concrete. They are 
only concrete to us when there is an accompanying realiza- 
tion of their meaning and importance. A false conception 
regarding the concrete has caused us to pin our faith to the 
use of blocks, pebbles, splints, shoe pegs, and grains of corn 
for the purpose of making quantities, relations, and pro- 
cesses concrete to young pupils. Two grains of corn and two 
grains of corn are four grains of corn. The total observation 
is of no consequence to any one, and therefore abstract. But 
two pennies in a boy’s purse to-day and an imaginary two 
to be earned to-morrow make the four pennies he needs for 
that coveted ball, and represents the truly concrete. The 
three kittens, two white and one black, left at the farm 
months ago, may be more concrete to the little girl who 
loved them than are the colored disks arranged in groups 
of two and one before her eyes. 
As rational beings, children are reluctant to use small ob- 
jects as mere counters. They try to build with the blocks; 
they want to tell about the pebbles they have picked up and 
to compare them as to size, color, etc.; they attempt to 
weave the slats together; they nibble at the corn or beg to 
plant it. Natively, children seek the true uses and meanings 
of things, and at this stage “doing sums’”’ with objects is 
almost as abstract as doing them with figures. 
Very suggestive and pointed are the following passages 
from Dewey and McLellan’s Psychology of Number: + 
The conscious adjusting of means to end, particularly such ad- 
justing as requires comparison of different means to pick out the 
fittest, is the source of all quantitative ideas — ideas such as more

  284 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
and less, nearer and farther, heavier and lighter, etc. Quantity 
means the valuation of a thing with reference to some end. 
Number is in reality a mode of measuring value, and it does not 
belong to things in themselves, but arises in the economical adapta- 
tion of things to some use or purpose. Number is not (psycho- 
logically) got from things, it is put into them. 
It is almost equally absurd to attempt to teach numerical ideas 
and processes without things and to teach them simply by things. 
It is not the mere perception of things which gives us the idea but 
the employing of the things in a constructive way. 
Merely attaching the names of familiar objects to num- 
bers does not make the concept any clearer or more vivid. 
I once saw an arithmetic lesson in a first grade, of which 
the following is an exact description. On the blackboard 
were some addition examples arranged as shown in the 
diagram. The children were required to fold their papers 
  
  
  so as to secure similar cross-lines and then to copy the 
figures. They were directed to put pencils in the groove at 
the back of the desk and the teacher then proceeded as 
follows. “Hands on heads!’’ “Three dogs and three dogs 
are .’ “Write!” “Hands on heads!” “Four pencils 
and two pencils are ——.”’ ‘‘Write!’’ “Hands on heads!” 
“Two sleds and five sleds are ——.”’ ‘‘ Write,” etc. At the 
command, ‘“‘Hands on heads!” all were expected to place 
pencils securely in the groove. At the pause after a state-  
-P-A-G-E-297
  ARITHMETIC A TOOL SUBJECT 285 
ment they were expected to find the answer, and at the com- 
mand, “Write,” they were to write it in the space left for the 
sum. All across the row the teacher continued in her at- 
tempt to make the numbers concrete by making them denote 
a number of familiar things. The children’s thinking was 
not affected at all by the mention of these things. They 
were acting as perfect little automatons. The teacher 
might, as the next example, have said, “Three gendarmes 
and four gendarmes are !” “Write!” — and it is safe 
to say that there would have been no falling-off in the ac- 
curacy of the children’s responses. 
The attempt to teach numerical ideas and processes with 
scarcely any use of things (or abstract figuring) and the 
attempt to teach by the use of objects as mere counters are 
still the two most prevalent methods to-day in primary 
arithmetic. Here and there, however, schools are beginning 
to base curriculum and methods partly on the conception 
presented above — that “number arises in the economical 
adaptation of things to some use or purpose.” Are there 
pennies enough, or sheets of paper enough, or wood of suffi- 
cient length for such and such a purpose? How many beans 
did I plant and how many have come up? About how many 
radishes does our market-man put in a bunch? Can I get a 
bunch of that size from my garden bed (or box) for my 
mother? Do I know how to write the numbers properly for 
the pages of the book Ihave made? How many more paper 
doilies must we make for our expected guests from another 
class? Is that score for our game added correctly? A 
slight error may give the game to the wrong person. Are 
any scissors missing? There should be twenty-five pairs. 
How many minutes by the clock does it take this class to get 
on their wraps? How many minutes for the quickest child? 
How many for the slowest? Let us see if we can save 
enough time for a story. How much ought we to charge for

    286 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
this lemonade? How can we find out? What will the best 
lily bulbs cost us? Can we afford to buy any other kind for 
our Easter bowls? 
Where there is constant and genuine contact with realities 
in arithmetic, half of the difficulties of comprehension disap- 
pear. Such terms as more than, less than, encugh, altogether, 
add to, remain, difference, divide, and many others which 
often confuse beginners, are readily incorporated in their 
active vocabulary because their meaning is made clear 
through practical use. Reasoning, in which many children 
seem so weak, becomes more accurate because they have so 
many opportunities to see real problems worked out step by 
step to a satisfactory conclusion. As an illustration of the 
disposition of children to go straight to realities in their 
thinking, I once heard of a small boy who had the following 
example to solve: “How much will one quart of milk cost if 
three cost thirty-six cents?” He replied promptly, “Oh, I 
know that, eleven cents a quart at Johnson’s.” 
What should be done is so much more obvious when the 
situation is a real one; wrong processes and absurd results are 
so much more easily detected. For this reason, if for no 
other, most of the problem work in the first three grades 
should be based upon the actual experience of the pupils or 
on situations so familiar as to be easily pictured imagi- 
natively. This is not intended as an argument for a pro- 
longation of the actual handling of objects and materials and 
the postponement of thought processes apart from manipu- 
lation. In fact, such manipulation can be dispensed with 
much earlier and with greater assurance in any given opera- 
tion if it has been performed often in order to reach interest- 
ing and desired ends rather than with counters and for 
illustrative purposes.

Wuar ArirHMetic DO CHILDREN REALLY UsE? 
A notable study was made by G. M. Wilson! to find out 
what arithmetic is actually required by social and business 
usage on the part of adults. He says: 
The procedure is designed to find out what arithmetic mature 
people use....The plan is to secure from mature people the 
actual figuring which they do, and then analyze the problems thus 
secured in order to determine the actual social and business de- 
mands upon arithmetic. 
While such an investigation has its obvious limitations, it 
is credited with furnishing valuable evidence as to which 
subjects and processes should be eliminated or subordinated 
and which should receive greater emphasis in school. 
No such study has ever been attempted as regards chil- 
dren’s use of number in everyday life, and it is hardly likely 
that any very reliable data could be secured. In a small 
way P. G. Noon? tried to make some such estimate. While 
his investigation dealt with grades above the primary it is 
worth while to examine the procedure used and to note the 
deductions: 
This paper is an attempt to answer two questions: (1) What 
arithmetical knowledge and power should be acquired by a child 
by the end of Grade VI? And especially, (2) What should be the 
content of the arithmetic course in Grades IV, V, and VI? 
The normal American child is the one considered — one well 
brought up in the middle class American home, who reached Grade 
VII at about the age of twelve. ... 
School at best provides an unnatural environment for a child. 
His out-of-door interests are the best expression of his personality. 
Accordingly I have gone to the children, who know me, and asked

tions, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York City, 1919.

them to tell me what uses of numbers they make or notice outside 
of school. The children were members of the Henry L. Pierce 
School in a choice residence section of the city of Boston. I went 
to twelve classes of Grades IV, V, and VI, and to two immature 
classes of Grade VII; in a most informal and friendly way I got 
them to give me the information I sought. 
Then follows a tabulation of the children’s answers. The 
author credits each item to the lowest grade that reported it. 
A part of the items mentioned by pupils in Grade IV will be 
cited here as typical: 
Games. Calling and reading numbers as, spots on dominoes, 
spots on dice. Counting, marbles and tops, keeping score, numbers 
of bounces of ball. Playing store. 
Going to store. Knowledge of quantity (such as pounds) of arti- 
cles bought, adding to find total cost of articles bought. Counting 
change. 
Other instances of reading (or recognition) of some number. Tele- 
phone number, automobile number, number on street car, number 
on house, telling time, reading thermometer. 
Other instances of counting. Money belonging to child, trading 
stamps, postage stamps in child’s collection. 
A great many other items similar in character to the above 
were given by pupils in higher grades. After presenting 
these in full Mr. Noon says: 
Thus do the children reveal the uses of numbers that everyday 
life causes them to make. Compare this mass of data with the 
table of contents of any textbook in arithmetic and notice how 
limited the children’s uses are. Reading of numbers and counting 
include nearly every item recorded above. . . . 
Below Grade VII, then, there are no needs felt by the child 
which require the teaching of arithmetic in the school. All he 
cares for is to count and to read numbers. 
What, then, shall we teach? 
In the first place, we may at once discard applied arithmetic in 
the grades below the Junior High School. Our textbooks may drop 
the “Practical Problems,” because they are as foreign as Chinese 
to a child’s way of thinking.
-P-A-G-E-301
  ARITHMETIC A TOOL SUBJECT 289 
Continuing the discussion, the writer recommends me- 
chanical drill in pure number as opposed to applied number. 
Other small informal surveys of the uses which children 
have for arithmetic outside of school have been made, but 
the exact results are not available. The impression left re- 
garding one report from an industrial community is that the 
children said they did not handle much money; that when 
they went on shopping errands they either charged the 
items to the parents’ account or they were given just the 
right amount of money for the purchase. This would not 
be the case in all communities, but it is probably true that 
children in general, left to themselves, do not make exten- 
sive use of mathematics. 
Granting that the child’s use of number is apt to be rather 
sporadic and random, does it follow that the school should 
neglect or abandon practical problems in favor of “pure 
number”? The opposing view to be offered here is based 
upon two features of the modern school: First, it furnishes a 
highly selected environment which provides opportunities, 
responsibilities, and duties of a very genuine social kind. 
The children are real citizens in this school world, carrying 
on many important affairs of a quantitative kind. Second, 
through experience and training thus secured in school, chil- 
dfen are enabled and encouraged to participate intelligently 
in home and community affairs in which heretofore they 
have been mere onlookers or dependents. 
Do Present-Day Curricuta Inpicate THE FUNCTIONAL 
Port or Virw? 
An examination of a large number of curricula, published 
since 1918, shows that it is still not uncommon to offer as 
a guide to teachers of arithmetic nothing but a tabulated 
arrangement of pure abstractions. Such courses of study 
usually have a brief introduction which recognizes in a very

perfunctory way the principle of application to problems of 
everyday life, but there is nothing to stimulate, illustrate, 
or direct this kind of work. The following examples are 
taken from courses of study published since 1919 and re- 
produce all that is indicated for the particular grades: :

In contrast to such outlines it is gratifying to notice the 
goodly number of cities and States which have recently pub- 
lished courses of study in arithmetic which not only recom- 
mend the immediate and useful application of number to 
children’s interests and activities, but which also contain 
vital subject-matter so organized that teachers can readily 
appropriate it. Among the more recent contributions of 
this kind are the following courses of study: 
Duluth Public Schools, Duluth, Minnesota, 1919. 
Richmond Public Schools, Richmond, Virginia, 1921. 
Passaic Public Schools, Passaic, New Jersey, 1923. 
State Course of Study for City Elementary Schools of 
Montana, Helena, Montana, 1920. 
Sections from some of these will be briefly described. The 
Richmond course is presented in outline in two parallel 
columns, one called “Suggested Activities,’’ the other “Sub- 
ject-Matter.”’ The first offers many good suggestions for 
number experience of a practical kind in school and at home, 
and the other gives briefly the corresponding facts and skills 
appropriate to the grade. There is no chance for teachers 
to lose sight of the fact that these two elements must be 
constantly employed to reinforce and clarify each other. 
In the Duluth course, a “General Project” is given for 
each grade beginning with II B. These projects are out- 
lined rather fully and the following statement is made in- 
troductory to each: 
General Project. This is a suggested project which will involve 
much of the subject-matter of the grade. Lest it should not pro- 
vide sufficient drill to fix the processes, minor projects are given as
-P-A-G-E-304
  292 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
details under each topic of subject-matter. The latter are unre- 
lated, but might be an outgrowth of a larger project similar to the 
one here given. 
  These “general projects” by grades are: Grade II B — 
Playing Store. II A — Playing Cafeteria. III B — Play- 
ing Post-Office. III A — Planning and making a class gar- 
den. [This isa real garden.] IV B— Buying Coal. [Partly 
real, partly supposititious, but based on actual local condi- 
tions.| IV A — To save school supplies. [A very genuine 
and practical study containing implications as to important 
habits and attitudes regarding property.] 
The following is a portion of the outline for Grade II B, 
taken from the Passaic Course of Study: 
The number work of the first grade is informal, and no effort has 
been made to organize it definitely, but in the second grade the 
teacher must consciously provide for situations which necessitate 
the use of numerical computation. These situations must have 
content value, and whatever is presented must appeal to the child 
as something that is going to aid his present interests in a very 
definite way. 
There is a brief statement of ‘“‘Technical points to be 
taught always through life situations,” followed by many 
suggestions for activities involving number. Among these 
are: 
1. Arithmetic games. Score kept for sides. 
a. Partners for a march — Child with card bearing a combi- 
nation is joined by child with a card bearing the answer. 
b. Bean-bag tossed through hoop with bell. 
c. Ring-toss. 
d. Ten-pins — stiff paper rolls. 
2. Thermometer — Use real thermometer. Place bulb in cold 
water and in sun to see change. Note temperatures inside 
schoolroom and outside. Meaning of “below zero” taught 
in winter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-305

8. Weather chart — Number of sunny days noted; rainy days, 
etc. 
4, Calendar for the year examined and varying number of days 
in the months noted; shortest month; long months; etc. 
Number of days between the present and Thanksgiving. 
Christmas, etc. 
. Change for one dollar. Use all ways. 
. Class attendance — record kept. 
. Reading and writing home addresses and telephone numbers. 
. Playing store. Store to be kept open once a week on a certain 
day. 
a. It has been estimated that children make 40% of the 
purchases of household supplies. If even half of this is 
true, we have a wonderful opportunity in playing store 
to closely relate the work in arithmetic to the activities of 
life outside the school. 
(1) He needs to know whether or not he has money 
enough to pay for his purchases. 
(2) If not, how much more will he need? 
(3) Has he received the right amount of change? 
(4) How many articles can he buy for his money? 
Note: These points will not all be present in any one 
experience; (2) and (4) relate more particularly 
to the child’s own personal purchases of mar- 
bles, oranges, or what.not. The outline for 2 B 
makes the foregoing possible.

There is a widespread uneasiness among thoughtful and 
well-informed teachers lest the present prominence of stand- 
ardized tests control completely the selection of subject- 
matter and method. Comparison of such abstract courses 
of study as the first two cited above with standard tests 
in arithmetic shows a strong correspondence. Part of the

Faithful and reasonably intelligent drill in sufficient 
amount along the meager lines laid down in the two courses 
illustrated on page 290, will enable pupils to attain a proper 
standing for the grade as measured by tests of this kind. To 
do this there need be no mention of application to practical 
affairs, much less any actual use of knowledge and skill. In- 
evitably the tendency of the school is to attach paramount 
importance to those achievements by which standing is de- 
termined, with the result that abstract operations will get 
the lion’s share of attention unless other influences pre- 
serve a balance. 
Care should be taken to inform children as to the real 
value of the tests to them. Pupils who are mature enough 
to pass these tests are mature enough to comprehend that 
the results merely indicate how well they can perform cer- 
tain operations that have already been used in a multitude 
of ways. If arithmetic has been well taught, second-grade 
pupils will understand the meaning of “measure,” and they 
can grasp the fundamental idea of an arithmetic scale in re-

VALUE OF THE Practica Test 
Granting the high importance of the steady, assured ac- 
quisition of fundamental skills and the corresponding meas- 
urement of such learning, it may still be questioned whether 
the center of gravity does not at present lie too much in that 
direction. In the ordinary daily work of the classroom 
should not more emphasis be placed upon what children can 
do that is personally and socially valuable in situations de- 
manding a knowledge of number, and less upon dissociated

facts and skills? Here are a few illustrations of objectives 
in the realm of social efficiency which are being used at 
different stages for the purpose of both teaching and testing. 
In each case the final test is, “Can you show that you are 
able to perform this useful or pleasurable act in a satisfactory 
way?” 
How well can you add? Are you a reliable score-keeper 
in games of bean-bag, ring-toss, and ten-pins? Can you 
add up the milk order which goes to the lunchroom? How 
do you tell the number of dots that turn up on the dice in 
playing parchesi? Do you know 5 and 5 dots, 4 and 4, 6 and 
8, or do you have to count them each time? When you move 
a “man” around the parchesi board, do you count each 
space or are you able to move by fives and sevens also? 
Can you count aloud to 50 in this blind-man’s game? 
Open your eyes. We have hidden seven balls, see how 
quickly you can find them. You have found three, how 
many more are there? etc. 
Are you able to carry a little purse of your own and pay 
your own car-fare? If your mother’s hands are full when 
you enter a car, can you pay correctly for two or three 
people? 
Can you show us that you can make change and count 
money well enough to be cashier or assistant cashier at the 
sale? Ought we to elect you if you cannot do this well? 
Can you get ready in two weeks to be ticket-seller at the 
puppet show? 
Can you tell time? How well can you tell time? If your 
mother were busy in a room where there is no timepiece and 
* should ask you to look at a clock and tell her the hour, could 
you be depended upon to do it correctly? 
Can you read the thermometer? 
Do you know how to find dates on a calendar?

grade? 
Would you like to mark all the birthdays of the children in 
this class? Let us see how many are in October, November, 
etc. Perhaps we can plan a surprise for the “birthday 
people” each month. 
If you are reading a book, can you tell how many pages 
are still to be read without counting them? 
Can you run on little errands for your mother to buy bread 
or apples, thread or pins, pay for the things out of a quarter 
or half-dollar and know that you have the right change? 
Let us see if you can do this. ; 
Can you help your mother to measure the flour, milk, 
sugar, etc., that she needs for making a cake? Can you re- 
ceive the groceries when they are delivered and help your 
mother check them off, or weigh them to see if the measure 
is correct? 
Would you be able to check up the weekly laundry bills? 
the weekly milk bills? 
Can you make neat, good-looking figures? Can you 
write numbers in hundreds? See if you can help me by 
writing these “examples” on the board for the next class, as 
I read the numbers to you. 
Can you write correctly telephone numbers given to you 
over the telephone? Can you read these in the “telephone 
way” and in the way numbers are usually read? 
How nearly can you get these automobile numbers as I 
flash them? Can you write this one from memory? 
How many have a small allowance of spending money?

AritHmetic AS AN Alp IN INTERPRETING THE LARGER 
Worip 
Next in importance to learning in order to do worth-while 
things in an efficient way comes learning in order to under- 
stand and appreciate what other people are doing — es- 
pecially the workers who are most directly serving us. Suz- 
zallo ! says, ‘‘Arithmetic is not a subject in which only the 
skills of calculation are cultivated; it is one that contributes 
social insight, just as history and geography do.” The 
quantitative side of food and clothing, of building and trans- 
portation, of agencies for safety, protection, and comfort, 
such as the fire department, police service, street-cleaning, 
park system, water supply, etc., can be made very interesting 
to children. In fact, these matters of individual and public 
interest cannot be made clear and vivid without some con- 
sideration of the mathematical side. The needs of other 
children the world over, the relatively favorable position 
of American children to-day and the consequent obligation 
which they owe, can be understood only through an intel- 
ligent dealing with quantities and relations. While many of 
these subjects will be introduced in the first three grades, 
there is always a danger that the quantitative aspects will 
be too complex and difficult, since world questions, industry, 
and public utilities necessarily involve very large quantities.

300 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
For this reason the use of arithmetic for purposes of inter- 
pretation and appreciation is more appropriate for grades 
above the third. At the same time, if used with judgment 
and discretion the simpler phases of these topics can be 
handled by third-grade children with profit — profit both 
in mathematical training and in deepened understanding of 
socially significant questions. 
Arithmetic should also be used to interpret questions of 
temporary and local interest. The following outline shows 
what was done by the third-grade classes in one school in 
. connection with a question of this sort: 
Citizens and school officers were urging that the street in 
front of the school be closed to traffic from ten to twelve in 
the morning to give play space to a succession of primary 
classes. The children were told about the movement and 
third-grade pupils undertook to ascertain about how many 
vehicles would be obliged to take another route in one day 
in order to give the school children a playground. 
In each of the four third grades the children appointed 
six committees of two, to watch in twenty-minute “shifts,” 
and count the vehicles which passed. This was done for 
four successive days, each third-grade class being respon- 
sible for one day. The count was made four times, partly 
in order to give exercise to more children and partly because 
the record for one day might not be typical.

  The children planned record sheets, and as each pair re- 
turned to the room they entered their count. Thus the 
column for III A! means: that six committees from that 
class, each serving for twenty minutes, recorded the six 
items denoting vehicles counted by them. 
How many vehicles passed between 10 a.m. and 12 m. the 
first day? the second day? etc. 
How many passed during these hours in four days?

Is this heavy traffic? What can you find out about the 
number of vehicles per hour on some other street? 
How many children could have a play-time each day in 
this space? 
Pupils enrolled in five first grades are ascertained to be 
29, 35, 32, 34, 36; in four second grades, 32, 35, 36, 36; in 
four third grades, 34, 35, 36, 36; in three fourth grades, 40, 
36, 38. 
Pupils decide to add these by grades and then combine 
the results. They find there are 166 enrolled in first grade, 
139 in second, 141 in third, 114 in fourth, or a total of 560 
children in the 16 classes which are to use the playground in 
the morning. 
Might the drivers of these 90 vehicles be asked to go some 
other way in order that 560 children may play in safety? 
Perhaps the members of the Council who are to decide this 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
302 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
question would like to have our figures. Can we do correct 
work in neat, clear form and send it to them with a letter? 
Many teachers who claim that there are few opportunities 
for really motivating the arithmetic work and for genuine 
application of facts and processes suited to a given grade 
constantly let occasions like the above slip by without ever 
seeing the possibilities. It is not a matter of ingenuity and 
inventiveness on the part of teachers, but rather of alertness 
in recognizing educative values inherent in incidents of 
school and community life. If half of the time and effort 
that go into the invention and use of foolish devices for drill 
in arithmetic were spent in discovering and developing fruit- 
ful number experience, there would not be so much need for 
isolated drill. Furthermore, when children are trying to 
find out interesting things and endeavoring to accomplish 
ends that seem to them worth while, they are perfectly will- 
ing to engage in necessary drill in a frank, straightforward, 
and businesslike way. 
ArtiriciaL Dryvicrs ARE Poor SUBSTITUTES FOR 
Pourposerut Dritu 
The sugar-coated device, as distinguished from a real 
game or lively, direct, and sensible drill, is always an ac- 
knowledgment of weakness in curriculum and method. Per- 
haps the reader does not know just what is meant by foolish 
devices. Here-are a few examples. 
A crude drawing of a house is on the blackboard with 
lurid flames and a cloud of smoke bursting from the window, 
a child at the window, and a ladder reaching from ground 
to window ledge. Figures are written on the rungs of the 
ladder — perhaps 2, 5, 4, 3,6. The teacher says: “Children, 
this house is on fire. Who wants to bea fireman? Whocan 
run up this ladder in one minute and save the child who is 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
  ARITHMETIC A TOOL SUBJECT 303 
about to be burned? All right, John, you may be the fire- 
man. Hurry up, hurry up, the fire is getting worse.” And 
John is supposed to add the numbers with greater interest, 
speed, and accuracy because of this exciting situation. If 
he makes a mistake the child in the picture is lost or another 
fireman must rush to the rescue. 
Toy balloons drawn on blackboard, colored, and arranged 
as if blowing away. Statements from the multiplication 
tables are printed in them, such as 2 X 6,3 X 4,2 X 8,3 X 5, 
4X 4, 2X9, ete. The teacher says: “‘See! children, these 
pretty balloons are blowing away. Who can catch the most? 
Who can catch them all in one minute?” ‘‘Catching” them 
consists in pointing to a statement and giving the answer. 
An oval is outlined on the board and crude fish of different 
sizes are drawn within. This is supposed to be a fishpond. 
The fish are considerately named for the convenience of the 
fishermen. They are called 7 — 4, 8 — 3, 6 — 3, 7 — 2, ete. 
The pointer is a fishing-rod. Of course the small Izaak 
Waltons must show their prowess by hooking the remainders 
as dexterously as possible. 
Here is a railroad train about to dash into a pile of débris 
on the tracks. ‘‘Choo-choo; it is almost there! See the 
faces of passengers at the windows! Who will save them?” 
The pile of débris consists of carefully labeled items placed 
there by some unfeeling but systematic person, and these 
the young heroes must with brain and brawn remove. The 
items (as you may by now have guessed) consist of mixed 
combinations in addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 
Lively, now! The train speeds on; one bad move and it will 
be dashed to pieces.
-P-A-G-E-316
    304 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
And so the pretense goes on with the necessity of ever in- 
creasing the excitation of the children’s jaded minds. They 
are not fooled long. Even a red-chalk fire and an imminent 
wreck lose their thrill when experienced too often. The fish 
refuse to rise to the old bait. The teacher, therefore, must 
produce some new attraction, and she turns to grab bags, 
rescue from shipwreck by breeches-buoy, coasting, gifts on 
the Christmas tree, etc., all these appearing, of course, in the 
guise of “examples” to be solved. 
Such artificial drill devices are an insult to the intelligence 
of bright children, and they probably confuse both bright 
and dull minds. To see the numerical concept “three and 
three more,” appearing now as a fish, now as a balloon, and 
again as fleeing rabbit, flying bird, and sinking ship, serves 
to dim rather than sharpen the impression. The inferiority 
of such presentation to the experience in number concepts 
which children get from calculations performed in the or- 
dinary way for a real and interesting purpose must be ob- 
vious to any one. Such drill is also very inferior to properly 
systematized and graded practice exercises worked out by 
experts who understand the laws of number as well as the 
laws of learning. Consideration should now be given to 
self-drill and teacher-directed exercises of this kind. 
Have Cuiwpren AN Inrrinsic Interest IN ARITHMETICAL 
Lrarnine? 
Even among the most ardent believers in the paramount 
importance of purposeful activity and sensible application 
in the teaching of arithmetic, few if any deny that a great 
many children manifest a keen interest in mathematical re- 
lations and exercises simply as puzzles or as “‘stunts”’ to test 
their mettle. They take great pleasure in showing that they 
can master a certain process or surpass some previous record 
in a given operation. They count the daisies by the road,
-P-A-G-E-317
ARITHMETIC A TOOL SUBJECT 305 
not because it matters how many daisies there are, but for 
the sheer satisfaction of rhythmical enumeration. They 
read numbers aloud wherever they see them and they try to 
make the figures. They often ask, “How many?” when the 
answer is evidently of no practical significance. They like 
to try to do what they see older boys and girls doing. With 
manifest satisfaction they announce, “To-morrow we are 
going to learn how to do long division!” And there seems to 
be something of the anticipatory thrill that might accom- 
pany the statement, “To-morrow I am going to scale Mount 
Everest.”” Most children, if well taught, get genuine satis- 
faction out of the successful accomplishment of a certain 
definite amount of work of a definite kind suited to their 
abilities, particularly if their work is recognized and com- 
mended. One little girl, who “just hated” in the beginning 
to do every new operation in arithmetic, would in a short 
time beg the teacher to give her more examples of the same 
kind. She had learned the trick and enjoyed making the 
examples come out right. 
There is a certain wonder attached to the first demonstra- 
tion of “proof,” in subtraction, for example, when one learns 
that adding the subtrahend and remainder will give the 
minuend. Fora time there is pleasure in testing the prin- 
ciple to see if it works. To some children cancellation is 
almost as much fun as tit-tat-toe. One little girl who was 
very clever in arithmetic delighted in long examples involv- 
ing cancellation, but she never thought of scrutinizing her 
answers to see whether they were reasonable or not. This 
same child greatly enjoyed working long examples in finding 
the greatest common divisor and least common multiple — 
those now discarded and derided operations. Intellectual 
play of this kind carries with it no criterion of relative worth. 
Children like to do the things which they know how to do 
sufficiently well to insure a fair degree of success and praise. 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
306 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
They like especially those operations which reveal a little of 
the exactitude of mathematics, though they could not state 
the cause of liking. I refer to. such types as those men- 
tioned above — proofs, cancellation, long division that 
comes out even, éte. Without careful guidance children 
are apt to go on practicing something already fairly well 
mastered rather than operations in which they are inexpert. 
With wise direction, however, the child’s native curiosity, 
the puzzle interest, pleasure in intellectual activity, and 
satisfaction which comes from success will furnish an im- 
portant part of the stimulus needed to carry him through 
the many repetitions of a process which are required for com- 
plete habituation. Thorndike ' has discussed very fully and 
fairly the respective uses and merits‘of the two aspects of 
arithmetic — that in which purpose centers in some affairs 
of life and that which he calls “intrinsic interest in arith- 
metical learning.” He gives the following summary of 
general principles which he believes to govern the question:   
In many cases arithmetical facts and principles can be well 
taught in connection with some problem or project which is not 
arithmetical, but which has special potency to arouse an intellectual 
activity in the pupil which by some ingenuity can be directed to 
arithmetical learning. Playing store is the most fundamental case. 
Planning for a party, seeing who wins a game of bean-bag, under- 
standing the calendar for a month, selecting Christmas presents, 
planning a picnic, arranging a garden, the clock, the watch with 
second hand, and drawing very simple maps are situations suggest- 
ing problems which may bring a living purpose into arithmetical 
learning in Grade 2. These are all available under ordinary condi- 
tions of class instruction. ... 
In general what should be meant when one says that it is de- 
sirable to have pupils in the problem-attitude when they are study- 
ing arithmetic is substantially as follows: 
First. Information that comes as an answer to questions is 
1 Thorndike, Edward L.: The Psychology of Arithmetic, pp. 274-77. 
The Macmillan Company, 1922. 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
———OO———— “OO 
ARITHMETIC A TOOL SUBJECT 307 
better attended to, understood, and remembered than information 
that just comes. 
Second. Similarly, movements that come as a step toward 
achieving an end that the pupil has in view are better connected 
with their appropriate situations, and such connections are longer 
retained, than is the case with movements that just happen. 
Third. The more the pupil is set toward getting the question 
answered or getting the end achieved, the greater is the satisfying- 
ness attached to the bonds of knowledge or skill which mean pro- 
gress thereto. 
Fourth. It is bad policy to rely exclusively on the purely intel- 
lectualistic problems of “How can I do this?” “‘How can I get 
the right answer?” ‘‘What is the reason for this?” “Is there a 
better way to do that?” and the like. It is bad policy to supple- 
ment these intellectualistic problems by only the remote problems 
of “How can I be fitted to earn a higher wage?” ‘“‘How can I 
make sure of graduating?” “How can I please my parents?” and 
the like. The purely intellectualistic problems have too weak an 
appeal for many pupils; the remote problems are weak so long as 
they are remote and, what is worse, may be deprived of the 
strength that they would have in due time if we attempt to use 
them too soon. It is the extreme of bad policy to neglect those 
personal and practical problems furnished by life outside the class 
in arithmetic the solution of which can really be furthered by arith- 
metic then and there. It is good policy to spend time in establish- 
ing certain mental sets — stimulating, or even creating, certain 
needs — setting up problems themselves — when the time so spent 
brings a sufficient improvement in the quality and quantity of the 
pupils’ interest in arithmetical learning. 
Fifth. It would be still worse policy to rely exclusively on pro- 
blems arising outside arithmetic. To learn arithmetic is itself a 
series of problems of intrinsic interest and worth to healthy-minded 
children. The need for ability to multiply with United States 
money or to add fractions or to compute per cents may be as truly 
vital and engaging as the need for skill to make a party dress or for 
money to buy it or for time to play baseball. The intellectualistic 
needs and problems should be considered along with all others, and 
given whatever weight their educational value deserves. 
Probably no one believes that there can be found during 
the short school hours enough intrinsically valuable situa-
-P-A-G-E-320

308 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
tions to provide the amount and kind of practice which chil- 
dren must have to insure adequate command of the four 
fundamental operations, for example. Even if such an 
achievement were possible, it would be a wasteful process 
for all but the most precocious children. But the actual use 
of arithmetic should play a large part at every stage. It 
should usually initiate processes, should help to direct and 
sustain effort in drill, and should furnish one very important 
measure of success. Schools in which there is an excessive 
amount of work in arithmetic where the objectives lie out- 
side the subject itself, are rare, if they exist at all. Few if 
any are centering upon immediate childish interests and oc- 
cupations to the detriment of “pure” mathematics, while 
those in which entire reliance is put upon formal abstrac- 
tions are countless. There is no apparent need in present- 
day practice to call a halt on applied arithmetic, or the 
attempt to have children use it as a practical tool. 
Suoutp We Expect to Incutcate Certain DrsiraBLE 
ArtiTUDES AND IpHALS THROUGH THE StupDy or ARITH- 
METIC? 
This phase of the subject may not be so prominent in 
primary grades as in more advanced work, but it should not 
be neglected. The conception of good workmanship can be 
strengthened by emphasizing the importance-of reliability. 
This is called for particularly where the results of the calcu- 
lations are of practical.consequence. In applied arithmetic 
a result is usually right or it is not right; that is, it forms a 
reliable basis for action or it misleads. Sometimes the care- 
less work of one child creates difficulty for a group, and on 
such occasions public opinion is outspoken on the side of 
careful, painstaking effort. 
Fair play can be encouraged in all sorts of games, but in 
those involving number it is especially important. Honest
-P-A-G-E-321
  ARITHMETIC A TOOL SUBJECT 309 
mistakes are made which must be rectified and deliberate 
juggling is very easy. A desire to render an accurate and 
honest reckoning is the standard to be worked for. 
Thrift, conservation, and real generosity have no perma- 
nent basis without a knowledge of relative values. A child 
may put all his pennies into his bank for the fun of dropping 
them in or from habit, rather than from any real idea of sav- 
ing. Thrift means subordination of the lesser or temporary 
good to the greater or more permanent. Conservation rests 
upon a similar basis. Children may be taught to conserve 
supplies of paper and pencils or to be careful of their clothes 
simply by constant pressure of one kind or another, but con- 
servation as a right principle of social behavior comes only 
with a knowledge of values and a sense of responsibility. 
Respect for the property of others can often be greatly 
increased by translating the values over into terms more 
easily understood. For example, the cost of the broken 
pane of glass measured by the boy’s own purse; or the im- 
pressive total required to refinish defaced desk tops. 
A child may readily give all his pennies away, either be- 
cause he got them without effort or because he has no reali- 
zation of their worth to him, rather than from any really 
generous impulse. The truest generosity where money is 
concerned is not found in the outpouring of ignorance or 
thoughtlessness, but in unselfish giving after counting the 
cost. Some knowledge and understanding of mathematical 
relations lies back of all these ethical and social attitudes and 
habits. In his book on The Use of Money, E. A. Kirkpatrick 
discusses in a very helpful way the financial training of chil- 
dren. 
Wherever money is to be raised through the sale of handi- 
craft or by giving an entertainment, wherever children are 
to have a part in the disbursement of funds either for the 
benefit of the school or for philanthropy, we should see to it
-P-A-G-E-322
    310 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
that right ideas as well as correct calculations are encouraged. 
What would be a fair price to ask for these things? Shall we 
get just as much as possible for them? Are our cookies as 
good, as large, as those at a certain shop of high standard? 
Is that correct and honest weight? Is this “show” really 
worth five cents? No matter on how small a scale affairs of 
this sort are conducted, they represent real business trans- 
actions, and sound rudimentary business principles should 
be taught.

i. SUGGESTIONS FOR A SMALL LIBRARY FOR PRIMARY 
TEACHERS AND SUPERVISORS 
Prope engaged in primary education are aware that until quite 
recently very few books have appeared dealing directly with the 
larger problems in this field. Numerous textbooks are available 
which present in some detail the methods and materials involved 
in teaching specific subjects, but the individual reader as well as 
classes in training schools have found it necessary to consult a large 
number of scattered references in order to get a satisfactory view 
of the modern primary school. 
The author has tried to bring together in this bibliography the 
best references which treat strictly of primary work as well as a few 
of those of a more general nature which are indispensable to work- 
ers in this field. Inspection will show that about four fifths of the 
books and bulletins listed have been published since 1918. This 
indicates not only that the compiler has endeavored to prepare a 
fresh and timely bibliography, but that there has been a great de- 
velopment of late in literature bearing directly on early education.

Il. FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT FOR PRIMARY 
GRADES 
It is our purpose to assemble here in condensed form information 
regarding furniture, equipment, materials, books, and pictures be- 
lieved to be essential or highly useful in meeting the requirements 
of liberal practice in primary schools. Detailed information on the 
equipment of kindergartens is given in Bulletin no. 13, 1921, 
published by the United States Bureau of Education. As the 
needs in lower primary grades for large blocks, well-chosen toys, 
and good physical apparatus is about the same as in the kinder- 
garten, we have avoided for the most part a repetition of items 
under those heads. An especial effort has been made to offer in- 
formation regarding materials which might aid in the enrichment 
of subjects and activities peculiar to primary grades, as this field 
has not been well covered heretofore. The equipment necessary to 
the proper development of Industrial Arts is a large subject in itself, 
and no attempt is made here to indicate the requirements. There 
are several references in the above bibliography which will furnish 
valuable information on this subject. 
Furniture For Tar Moprern Primary Crassroom 
Small tables seating one or two children. Most teachers prefer 
tables without drawers, depending on cabinets or shelves for ma- 
terials. Many schools have tables made to order by local firms. 
The following measurements have been found satisfactory in the 
Horace Mann School: 
First and Second Grades. Top of table for one child 21’’ x 18”. 
Top of table for two children 42” < 18”. Height, most of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
316 APPENDIX 
iables in first grade, 22’; a few 24’. Most of those in second grade 
24"; a few 22” and 25”. 
Chairs — any good model, in heights cf 12’’, 18”, and 14”. The 
Mosher chair and the Posture League chair are examples of chairs 
which satisfy hygienic requirements. 
Satisfactory types of tables and chairs are: 
The Eclipse Kindergarten Table and Chair. The Theodor 
Kundtz Co., Cleveland, Ohio. 
New York Kindergarten Table and Chair. Scientific Seating 
Company, 35 Warren Street, New York City. 
While these are designated as kindergarten tables and chairs, they 
are made in sizes suitable for primary grades. 
Lewis Folding Table — Milton Bradley. 
A new type of folding table made to accommodate one or more 
pupils. Very firm and rigid when open and easy for children to 
fold. Recommended for kindergarten and elementary classrooms 
where more floor space is needed at times for larger activities. 
Individual cabinets or “lockers” for children’s work: 
These are often built as a continuous structure along one side of 
the room, divided into the requisite number of suitable spaces, with 
or without doors. 7 
A height of 26’’, depth of 18’, and length of 20’ will give generous 
space to thirty children. Divide the length at intervals of 16” and 
put a shelf 13” from the floor. Each child will then have a space 
18” < 16” x 13’. This gives room for large drawings and un- 
finished constructions, such as doll furniture, boats, ete., as well as 
books, paints, and other materials. The top of the entire structure 
is most useful, offering space for books, plants, aquarium, toys, and 
displays of various kinds in easy reach of the children.

of six to ten feet. Approved size of type, capitals, 7/8”. Price 
range for this size, $3 to $3.75. Milton Bradley, and other 
school supply companies.

-P-A-G-E-330

reading matter, but setting the type is a tedious process. Any 
number of copies can be printed after type is set. Price with 
extra large holder about $5. A. G. Seiler, 1224 Amsterdam 
Avenue, New York. 
Gelatine duplicator. Known under various names — Duplicopier, 
Duplicator, Hektograph, etc. One of the quickest and least ex- 
pensive means of getting multiple copy. Especially good where 
teacher wishes to use her own free-hand printing. Wide price 
range according to size, quality, and number of surfaces for 
printing. For sale by all general school supply companies. 
The greatest asset possible in printing fresh, interesting, and 
immediately significant matter is a good typewriter having extra 
large or primer-size type. On most standard machines, type of this 
size may be substituted for ordinary type. Manufacturers will 
furnish information. By cutting a stencil or by using a speciai 
typewriter ribbon, quantity production is easy.

VII. REPRESENTATIVE AND DRAMATIC PLAY 
As stated above the reader should consult The Housing and 
Equipment of Kindergartens for full list of larger materials and tools 
for play and construction. A few of the most essential items are 
mentioned here. 
Screen in three or four sections. This is to take the place of build- 
ings constructed with large floor blocks. Children have prob- 
ably secured the full educational value of such building if they 
have had the big blocks in kindergarten and first grade. In later 
primary years they still need an enclosure which may serve as 
house, shop, theater, library, mill, ete. The right kind of screen 
is very adaptable and it stimulates and partly controls valuable 
play activities. Directions for making such a screen may be 
obtained from Industrial Arts Co-operative Service, Teachers 
College, Columbia University. 
Dolls — Schoenhut All-Wood Dolls — Attractive and durable dolls 
particularly good for school use. Smaller celluloid dolls, ob- 
tainable at any toy shop — should also be furnished. ¢ 
Animals — Toy animals to use in play of farm life, dramatic play, 
sand table scenes. Also to serve as models for representation in 
clay. 
Leatiles — Inexpensive fabrics such as cheesecloth and cambric in 
white and colors for costumes which children will make for them-

IX. TEXTBOOKS 
REAvING 
There is an embarrassment of riches in the matter of good read- 
ing textbooks now available, and it is impossible to pick out six or 
seven and say, with reason and justice, “These are the best.” In 
selecting this short list the author was guided by the following con- 
siderations. To seek — 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  326 APPENDIX 
1. Variety — selecting some books purely literary in content 
and others containing some realistic material. 
2. Books which make possible the use of sound and broad meth- 
ods of teaching. 
8. Those which are very attractive to children. 
4. Those which authors and publishers are keeping up to date in 
the way of manuals and supplementary material.

  PREFACE 
Control measures for insect pests and 
plant diseases are in their infancy. There 
are many economic problems which have 
not been solved. A great amount of ex- 
perimental work has been done, but most of 
the information obtained is fragmentary or 
unavailable to the average person. It is the 
author’s desire to set forth in a simple and 
accurate manner that information which has 
accrued from years of experimentation so 
that the layman or student may easily refer 
to it. The author does not discredit the 
bulletins from the various State Experiment 
Stations and the Bureaus of the United 
States Department of Agriculture; they are 
very valuable, and have been called upon for 
information and for verification of the data 
included in this book. The great difficulty 
has been that this vast amount of informa- 
tion has not been availabie or accessible, 
except specific information on certain sub- 
jects. The general agriculturist cannot go

to a library for his information; he needs it 
all in hand at the same time. It is my de- 
sire that this book may be found of some 
value as a reference guide or hand book for 
the gardener, fruit-grower, farmer or stu- 
dent, and if in a small way it does answer 
such a purpose I shall feel amply repaid for 
the time I have spent in compiling this data. 
The reader will find the easiest way to use 
this book is by referring to the index for the 
subject that he wishes to look up; then after 
finding in the tables what spray to use on 
that particular crop, he will turn to the chap- 
ter on Insecticides and Fungicides and there 
find his spray treated as to occurrence, 
chemical reactions, properties, formula, and 
the specific method for preparing it for field 
use. 
I wish to acknowledge the great help 
which I have received from the various bul- 
letins of the State Experiment Stations and 
the Department of Agriculture; a great deal 
has been taken directly from them, and bul- 
letins from the Arkansas Station have been 
followed for the form of this manuscript. 
Bulletins from New York and Oregon have

helped with material for orchard data; bul- 
letins from California and Florida have been 
referred to for information concerning citrus 
and pecan work; bulletins from the Bureau 
of Entomology have been consulted in refer- 
ence to field crop spraying and dusting. I 
also particularly wish to acknowledge the 
great help received from my wife, Carrie 
Doty Cockerham, in proof reading and other- 
wise assisting with chemical formulas and 
equations.

  A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
CHAPTER I 
SPRAY PUMPS 
The most vital and essential factor in the 
control and eradication of insects and. dis- 
eases of plants is that of spray pumps. It 
does not matter how perfectly a spray mate- 
rial may have been prepared, and how efhi- 
cient it may be in the destruction of these 
pests, the best results cannot be obtained 
without having first a modern spray pump. 
There are various kinds of pumps and dust- 
ing machines adapted to the various kinds of 
spraying work.- The farmer or gardener 
must decide for himself the particular type 
_ best suited for his work. The different types 
of sprayers, dusters, and accessories are 
treated in a brief manner in this chapter. 
Atomizers——Atomizers are small hand 
sprayers, holding a quart to half a gallon of 
liquid. They may be of tin, copper or glass.

  A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
These are only suitable for a very few small 
plants in the yard or garden. 
Bucket Pumps.—This type of pump is a 
small cylindrical pump with a handle, foot 
brace and small air chamber. This may be 
set in a bucket or tub, and is operated by 
placing one foot on the brace, operating the 
handle with one hand and the nozzle with 
the other. This type of pump gives a strong 
spray, but is recommended for the small 
garden or a few very small trees. It facili- 
tates work by being easy to move from place 
to place. 
Knapsack Pumps.—Knapsack pumps are 
those which are carried on the back by means 
of straps fastened over the shoulders. The 
tank is usually of copper or galvanized iron. 
It is similar to the bucket pump; has lever 
type handle, with tank capacity of two to 
four gallons. This type of pump, by being 
carried on the back, enables the operator to 
move along a row of plants, pumping with 
one hand and operating the nozzle with the 
other. It permits constant spraying until the 
tank is emptied. It is now being displaced 
by the compressed air sprayer. It is heavy 
[4] 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
    
A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
to carry, and is disagreeable to handle, on 
account of the leakage of the spray material 
on the operator. 
Compressed Air Pump.—This pump has 
a brass or copper tank and a capacity of 2% 
to 5 gallons. These tanks are cylindrical and 
are carried over the shoulder by means of a 
strap, which is attached to them. They con- 
tain an air chamber, which is extended down 
into the tank of liquid, and is operated by a 
handle, which extends through to the outside. 
The tank is filled with the spray material, 
the top is fastened on securely, and then the 
pump handle is operated until sufficient pres- 
sure is obtained to permit thorough spraying. 
When the pressure has run low, and the 
spray is getting weak, the pump is set on the 
ground, and a new pressure is secured by 
pumping again. This enables constant spray- 
ing without pumping while at work. 
Barrel Pumps.—This is the best type of 
pump for the small farm or orchard. It has 
a capacity of about 500 trees per day. It 
should have the following advantages: First, 
guarantee of 80 to 100 lbs. pressure; second, 
large air chamber in barrel; third, working 
[5]
-P-A-G-E-18
  | A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
parts should be inside the barrel; fourth, 
cylinder, plunger, valves and working parts 
should be of brass, other parts of malleable 
iron; fifth, should have an agitator; sixth, 
pump should be clamped to barrel; seventh, 
valves and valve seats easily adjustable for 
cleaning. These barrels will hold about 40 
gallons of spray material, and they may be 
carried from place to place by means of a 
wagon or truck, or may be built on a sled. 
These will permit the operation of several 
nozzles at the same time. 
Horizontal Pumps.—These pumps are 
adaptable for use on 50 to 150 gallon 
barrels; are not attached to barrel; are more 
powerful than the barrel pump; have double 
action, and give a constant spray. 
Power Pumps.—These pumps are adapted 
for extensive work, are costly and are a com- 
bination of spray pump, tank and gas engine. 
They are mounted on trucks with towers for 
high work. As in the other pumps, such 
working parts as valves, nozzles and pistons 
should be of brass. The other working parts 
may be of ordinary malleable iron. The 
tanks with these pumps hold 300 to 400 
[6]
-P-A-G-E-19
A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
gallons. Any gas engine of two or three 
horse-power will operate them. 
Traction Pumps.—These are especially 
adapted to row work. They were designed 
especially for low-growing crops, such as 
potatoes, beets, cabbage, etc. With this type 
the barrel and pump are mounted on carts. 
They receive their power from traction ob- 
tained by cogs on the wheels or axle of the 
cart. They are also usually fitted with ex- 
tension rods, extending across the back part 
of the cart, with nozzles attached at inter- 
vals to accommodate the width’ of rows that 
are to be sprayed. A disadvantage of this 
type of pump is that the frame work of the 
cart is usually wood, and the writer has 
found that this is springy and gives under 
strain and pressure, which hinders the proper 
operation of the pump and a steady, constant 
flow of the spray. When operated satisfac- 
torily, however, the capacity is a great many 
acres per day. 
Gas Sprayers-—These sprayers use car: 
bonic acid for power. This gas is discharged 
from the gas tank into the metal tank, con- 
taining the spray material, until the pres- 
7a
-P-A-G-E-20

sure, which is desired, is obtained. This 
type of sprayer gives a constant pressure, 
and produces a very fine spray. It is costlier 
than gasoline power, but is very effective. It 
cannot be used with lime-sulphur, on account 
of chemical reaction. 
Large Compressed Air Pump. — This 
pump is very similar to the gas pump, and is 
manipulated on the same principle. Gives 
constant pressure. For extensive work with 
large machines the double tank or double 
compartment tank arrangement is used. 
These are changed at the filling station. 
While one tank is carried in the field for 
spraying, the other is being recharged by 
gasoline engine power at the filling station. 
These air tanks are very similar to the tanks 
found around garages for inflating automo- 
bile tires. 
DUSTING APPARATUS 
Within the last few years a great advance- 
ment has been made in dusting material and 
machinery. It has been found that where 
dusting can be practiced there is a great 
saving in labor and time. Dusting has been 
[8]
-P-A-G-E-21
A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
brought to the front, principally, in orchard 
work on apples, for rots and insects, and on 
peaches for the plum curculio and bacteriosis, 
and in field work on cotton for the cotton 
boll weevil. The insecticide companies and 
machinery manufacturers are devoting much 
more time and care to the development of 
more suitable types of insecticides and fungi- 
cides and dusting machinery. The princi- 
pal types of dusters and their use will be 
given below in this chapter. 
Powder Bellows——These are small dust- 
ers, which are adapted for use where there 
are only a few plants in the garden or yard 
to be treated. They are cheap, easy of 
operation and do not get out of fix easily. 
A common type of bellows, similar to the 
large ones used to fan the blacksmith’s fire, 
is being used. 
Powder Gun.—These are light and dur- 
able, are made of metal, and have a capacity 
of 10 to 20 lbs. of arsenical dusts and are 
carried by means of a strap over the shoul- 
der. They should rest firmly against the 
body to allow for ease of operation and ease 
of distributing the dust. Should have a 
[9]
-P-A-G-E-22
  A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
geared hand crank. A four or five foot tube 
for conveying the dust is found best. The 
tube at the end is flattened and narrowed, 
giving a fan effect to the dust as it is forced 
out. This aids in directing the dust to cover 
the particular kind of crop being treated. 
This type gun has a capacity of four or five 
acres per day. It is particularly adapted to 
row work. 
Power Duster-—These dusters are very 
large, and are mounted on trucks or sleds. 
The outfit is connected with gas engine, the 
power transmitted by belt or cogs. The dust 
paddles must revolve very rapidly. They 
should be equipped with a 3” to 4” corru- 
gated rubber hose to convey dust to trees 
and plants. This type of duster is adapted 
to tree and orchard work, or rows of plants, 
such as cotton. To be effective, this must 
make a fog, and the dust must not come out 
in coarse particles. Since dusting has been 
found practical for controlling the cotton 
boll weevil, several types of dusters have 
been developed. One of the common types 
is that which derives its power from the gas 
engine. Another type which has been re- 
[10]
-P-A-G-E-23
A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
cently developed is that which derives its 
power from wheel traction, by means of cogs 
on the wheels or axles. They also have ex- 
tension rods held on a frame and arranged 
to dust from three to six rows at a time. 
They must have a large hopper, in order not 
to have to refill so often. In the case of 
dusting for the cotton boll weevil, a special 
light must be used for night work. They 
are also fitted with adjustable wheels to ac- 
commodate the different widths of rows. 
Special Pulverizers——These pulverizers 
are for re-sifting and pulverizing the pow- 
dered arsenicals or other insecticides or 
fungicides. This is accomplished by means 
of stiff brushes, brushing or rubbing the ma- 
terial through wire sieves. This is some- 
times called screening. Without having the 
material in a superfine state, dusting is not 
as practical as would ordinarily be expected. 
These machines must have either traction 
power or gas engine power. 
FIXTURES OR ACCESSORIES 
Every person who keeps or operates a 
spray pump of any kind should keep on hand 
[ir]
-P-A-G-E-24
  A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
some of the most essential accessories, to be 
used in case of a breakdown during the busy 
season. The most important of these fix- 
tures are nozzles, valves, valve seats, hose, 
extension rods, connections, and platforms. 
Nozzles —There are three principal types 
of nozzles—the disc, the Bordeaux and the 
vermorel. The disc and the vermorel make 
a cone shaped spray, and the Bordeaux, a 
fan shaped spray. They should be of brass 
with elbowed necks. For tree work a special 
type of nozzle, known as the power gun, has 
been developed. This gives.a solid stream 
spray, which does not break into a mist until 
several yards from the nozzle. This is espe- 
cially suitable for forest and park work. 
One of the main features about a nozzle is 
that it should be easy to clean. When they 
become clogged up, as they sometimes will, 
a person should be able to clean them with- 
out having to stop the machine. 
Hose.—The hose for a pump should be of 
rubber or fabric. This should be reinforced 
where it bends most, which is usually near 
the tank. It can be considerably strength- 
ened by having a wire coil placed around it. 
[12]
-P-A-G-E-25
A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
Sufficient length should be had for the hose 
and it should be attached to the nozzle and 
the pump with strong, durable clamps. 
Extension Rods——They should be light, 
handy and convenient, and of sufficient 
length. They are usually of bamboo or 
brass. These are attached to the outer end 
of the hose and enable the operator to stand 
on the ground or platform and move the 
nozzle around over the tree or plant at will. 
Without the extension rod, this could not be 
done, for the hose could not be handled in 
that manner. 
Platforms.—Platforms are built on the 
trucks on which the barrel or power sprayer 
is carried or built. They are usually of wood 
or light iron or steel. Should be durable and 
of sufficient height to make the work of tree 
spraying easy. They should be large enough 
and strong enough to accommodate two or 
more men; should be attached so that they 
are easily removed from truck or wagon.

  Pyrethrum.—A section in the genus Chrys- 
anthemum, has a strong, bitter smell. The 
common insect powders are the dried flow- 
ers and roots of the plants known as Pyre- 
thrum roseum and Pyrethrum cincrarioe- 
folium. Pyrethrum is chiefly used in a dust 
form for household insects such as fleas, 
roaches, ants, etc. Is applied in cracks and 
crevices. 
Hellebore.—Plants of the family Renon- 
culaceae contain a bitter substance, which 
imparts violently drastic properties to them 
and are poisonous in large doses. It is the 
roots that contain this substance for the 
most part. The pulverized roots are stirred 
up with H,O, after being diluted with flour, 
to make a liquid insecticide, which is very 
poisonous to insects that gnaw leaves.

  Calcium Arsenate—This is an insecticide 
that is becoming very popular. Is a stomach 
poison for insects. Within the last few years 
it has been brought forward as a great factor 
in poisoning the cotton boll weevil. The 
most economical method of application is in 
the form of a dust. This is applied at night 
preferably, or when the leaves and plants are 
moist. Below is the form best adapted for 
boll weevil poisoning.

Requirements 
Not less than 40% arsenic pentoxide. 
Not more than .75% water soluble arsenic 
pentoxide. 
Density not less than 80 or more than 100 
cu. in, per pound. 
No. Ib. poison per treatment, 5 or more per acre. 
No. applications per season, usually 4. (Gener- 
ally speaking.) 
Time for first application, when 10% squares are 
punctured. 
Applications should be made as serious- 
ness of infestation requires; dust often 
enough to keep punctured squares below 20 
or 30 per cent if possible. Local conditions 
absolutely control number and time of appli- 
cations. 
Bordeaux Mixture.—A solution of CuSO, 
mixed with milk of lime in which Cu(OH), 
is precipitated is called Bordeaux Mixture. 
CuSO,-+Ca(OH),—Cu(OH).+CaSO, 
May be made at home or bought in paste 
form. It should be neutral or slightly alka- 
line, it should never contain an excess of 
CuSO,, the liquid should be colorless, should 
give no reaction with blue litmus. The 
liquid should-be thoroughly tested for excess

of CuSO, and Ca(OH). If it does not 
respond to these tests, it is unfit for the pur- 
pose for which it is intended. 
Preparation for spray 
Copper sulphate 
Stave lime 
  A milk of lime should be prepared and diluted 
with the so gal. water. Then the dissolved 
copper sulphate should be diluted with it. 
Agitate thoroughly. 
Sulphur (S.).—Two solid forms, perfectly 
distinct, two different liquid states of aggre- 
gation. 
Rhombic Sulphur.—Native, specific grav- 
ity 2.06. Melts at 112.8°. Almost in- 
soluble in H.O; dissolves in carbon bisul- 
phide (41 to 100 at 18°); stable below 96°. 
Above that temperature changes to mono- 
clinic. 
Monoclinic—When a large mass of 
melted sulphur solidifies slowly, before the 
whole has become solid, if the crust is pierced 
and the remaining liquid poured out, the 
interior is found to be lined with long trans- 
parent crystals (needles). Colorless, speci- 
fic gravity 1.96, melts at 119.25°. 
[22]
-P-A-G-E-35
A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
This form can only be kept above 96°. 
When allowed to cool, changes to rhombic. 
When melted sulphur is heated, it under- 
goes a gradual change. The pale yellow 
liquid suddenly becomes dark brown and 
very viscous. The pale yellow liquid is SA 
and the dark brown Sv. Beyond 260° the 
viscidity lessens and at 444.7° the liquid boils 
and passes into sulphur vapor. When S. is 
boiled and suddenly chilled by pouring into 
cold water, it is first semi-fluid. After sev- 
eral days this plastic sulphur becomes hard. 
It is almost insoluble in any solvent. It is 
called amorphous. Sulphur, when heated, 
combines with most of the metals, unites also 
with many non-metals, chemically active. - 
Flowers of sulphur is a mixture of rhom- 
bic and amorphous. It destroys fungi in 
vineyards by virtue of the traces of H,SO, 
it yields on oxidation. 
In Sicily sulphur is obtained by the proc- 
ess of melting it away from the volcanic 
rock at a low temperature. The liquid is 
run into wooden molds, in which it solidifies 
in the form of roll sulphur. The best qual-

  A MANUAL FOR SPRAYING 
In Louisiana it is extracted by the krasch 
method. Four pipes are lowered, one within 
the other, to reach the deposit. Water under 
pressure, previously heated to 170°, is 
pumped down the two outside pipes (6 and 
8 inches in diameter). After time has been 
allowed for the melting of the sulphur, com- 
pressed air is forced down the innermost 
pipe (1 inch in diameter). The melted sul- 
phur has twice the specific gravity of the 
H.O in the outer pipes. But the mixture of 
air and sulphur has about the same gravity, 
and so flows freely up the three inch pipe 
surrounding the air pipe. The element flows 
into a large wooden enclosure, in which it 
solidifies, and from which it is blasted for 
use. The whole supply of the United States 
is obtained from Louisiana. 
Lime-Sulphur.—This spray is a combina- 
tion of lime and sulphur, both of which have 
been fully described in this chapter. 
Entomologists and pathologists have 
found through experimentation that lime 
properly combined with sulphur makes an 
excellent remedy for certain pests.

Ammoniacal Copper Carbonate.— 
Preparation 
  Weigh out 5 oz. copper carbonate, and 
make into a thin paste with small amount of 
water. Three pints of strong ammonia (26° 
Baumé) are then diluted with water to make 
2 gal. (Use wooden or porcelain vessel.) 
Add the copper carbonate paste and stir 
occasionally. After all the copper carbonate 
has dissolved that will, a deep blue color will 
be obtained. Pour off solution, leaving the 
sediment, and dilute with 48 gal. water. 
The spray is then ready for applying. 
Blue Vitriol—Or copper sulphate 
(CuSO,).5H.O. Is a blue crystal, known 
as blue stone. The aqueous solution has an 
acidic reaction. The anhydrous salt is 
white, soluble in H,O, 100 lb. H:O to 36 
Ib. CuSO, at 19° €. 
CuSO, is prepared on a large scale by 
placing coarse Cu. in a perforated lead bas- 
ket and then causing the basket and contents 
to move up and down, so that they will at

Also obtained by heating Cu. in a furnace 
with sulphur and admitting air to oxidize the 
cuprous sulphide. The mixture of cupric 
sulphate and cupric oxide which is formed is 
treated with H.SQ,. 
CuSO, is a powerful disinfectant. It co- 
agulates albumen.

Crude Petroleum (C*H*"+*).—This is a 
natural mixture of all the paraffin series 
from ethane to hexadecane. American pe- 
troleums contain besides these saturated 
hydrocarbides, some non-saturated hydro- 
carbides of the series of C"H*" as well as a 
little cumene and mesitylene. It occurs in 
large quantities beneath the surface of the 
earth in many parts of the U. S. and some 
other countries. The crude oil is pumped 
up to the surface from these subterranean 
sheets. It is a heavy, black oil.

Crude Carbolic Acid, (Cj;HsOH).—Phe- 
nol obtained from carbolic oils, which is the 
second oil obtained in the distillation of coal 
tar, from which is also obtained the cressol 
and xylenol groups of acids. 
The carbolic acid has a peculiar, penetrat- 
ing odor, acid burning taste, somewhat like 
creosote; it is caustic and poisonous. It is 
extracted from coal tar, by treating with 
caustic soda, in which the carbolic acid dis- 
solves. The liquid is treated by five times its 
weight of hot HO. The phenols dissolve, 
the hydro-carbides remain insoluble. Treat 
this liquid with dilute H.SO, and decant. 
Crude C;H;OH with its homologues is ob- 
tained. 
The slightest traces of H,O liquefies the 
solid, pure substance. It coagulates albu-

ing insects and is applied as a contact poison. 
Commercial nicotine usually contains about 
40% pure nicotine.

C., slightly soluble in alcohol and ether, not 
soluble in H,O. Colorless, heavy liquid. 
The pure substance is said to have a pleasing 
odor, but it undergoes decomposition, which 
gives it a very disagreeable odor. It is very 
inflammable and mobile. It is manufactured 
from coke and sulphur, C+2S—>CS,. A 
very high temperature is required, and is 
obtained by electric furnace. The main part

Sulphur Dioxide (SO,).—Melting point, 
—72.7°. Boiling point --8° when in solid 
form. At normal pressure and temperature 
it exists as a choking gas, soluble in water, 
the solution being acidic. The gas is color- 
less, and has a characteristic sharp taste; 
twice as heavy as air; easily liquefied; does 
not burn, and will not support combustion. 
It is prepared on a large scale, by the 
burning of the element sulphur or by the 
burning of iron pyrites, FeS,. 4FeS.+110.

Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN).—When solid 
its melting point is —13.8°. Boiling point 
is 26.54°; soluble in hot and cold water, 
alcohol and ether. The free acid is color- 
less, its odor resembles that of bitter 
almonds, burns with blue flame, readily 
soluble in H.O. Solution is unstable, giving 
amorphous substances, and ammonium for- 
mate, oxalic acid, etc. 
There are several ways it may be pre- 
pared, including the following: By the dry 
distillation of ammonium formate, by the 
distillation of potassium ferrocyanid with 
dilute H,SO, (with special precautions), 
with sodium cyanid or potassium cyanid 
treated with sulphuric acid. 
The last two are the most commonly used. 
When sodium cyanid or potassium cyanid 
comes in contact with acids, there is formed 
this very poisonous hydrocyanic or prussic 
acid.

Preparation: By distillation of coal tar. — 
Obtained from the heavy oils which pass 
between 180° and 260° C. Oils are allowed 
to stand for some time in the cold and the 
naphthalene crystals are deposited and are 
separated from the oils by being turbined. 
These crystals are placed under the hy- 
draulic press, then washed with sodium 
hydroxide and sulphuric acid and then hot 
H.O. They are then distilled in cast iron 
retorts, the naphthalene distilling between 
210° and 220° C. It is collected in slightly 
moist wooden vessels in which it solidifies 
in a few hours. 
Crude C,H, may be used for agricultural 
purposes, but it is rarely used alone. 
Preparation for use 
Used as a repellent for such insects as 
fleas, clothes moths, carpet beetles, the 
flaked form should be sprinkled liberally 
around infested rooms or closets, under car- 
pets and in clothes chests. The common 
commercial ‘‘Moth Balls’ are made of 
naphthalene.

CHAPTER VIII 
DUSTING 
Perhaps no other phase of insecticide and 
fungicide work has developed as rapidly in 
the past few years as has dusting. Along 
two prominent lines has this taken very im- 
portant advances: in the apple growing sec- 
tion, especially in New York state, and in the 
control of the cotton boll weevil in the Mis- 
sissippi delta. Through a great number of 
varied experiments the materials used for 
insect and disease control have been greatly 
improved, and at the same time machinery 
for the proper application of these materials 
has developed wonderfully. It is my opinion 
that dusting is to become more and more 
popular since there is a great saving in time 
and labor in treating a crop.

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Wuuts the progressive public school teacher of to-day is one 
who keeps in touch with important educational develop- 
ments generally, and one who tries to bring her work into 
conformity with the larger administrative aims of the school 
system in which she teaches, the most important single 
measure of her progressiveness is, after all, whether or not 
she experiments with and uses various teaching methods 
with a view to the improvement of her classroom instruction. 
The ability to develop a flexible and an effective classroom 
technique will probably always remain the primary criterion 
for estimating a teacher’s growth and professional progress. 
A general development in the technique of classroom 
instruction is at present taking place, that is no less re- 
markable in character and significance for the future than 
the many other forward movements now under way in other 
phases of the educational service. While this development 
has been going on for more than a generation, the past de- 
cade has witnessed the most rapid changes in instructional 
methods in all our educational history. The teachings of 
psychology, sociology, supervision, and administration have 
been applied to teaching; the new testing and guidance 
movements have indicated new directions for effort; new 
civic and social relationships have called for new ways of 
handling the instructional problem; and the socialized 
recitation, supervised study, the problem and _ project 
methods, differentiated instruction, and experiments tending 
toward individual teaching have all alike tended to modify 
old practices and methods and to leave behind the teacher 
who does not continually strive to improve her classroom

technique by conscious experimentation with the methods 
that have been worked out and successfully applied. In 
such a changing situation the teacher in service, as well as 
the novice in the training school, must inform herself about 
the old and the new alike in the field of method and devices. 
The experienced teacher must decide, if she wishes to keep 
step with the progress of the schools, what of the old she 
must retain and what of the new she should try to understand 
and apply in her classroom work. 
A revision and a rewriting of our educational literature, 
and particularly that relating to the aims and methods and 
tools of instruction, is rapidly taking place. Much that we 
have taken for granted in the past is being challenged. 
Methods of work that once were widely cherished are being 
discarded, and whatever is being retained is retained because 
it can demonstrate its worth in a new way. Both our point 
of view and our method of approach in dealing with edu- 
cational problems have shifted from the philosophic to the 
scientific. Mere opinion no longer holds — not even the 
opinion of those who hold places of prominence. Opinion 
that is based on general experienced observation must give 
way, if challenged by results established by experimentation. 
Careful control of conditions, and accurate, objective, sta- 
tistical data, compel even old prejudices and traditional 
convictions and practices to give way to new attitudes and 
methods. Problems that have not been solved by facts 
may still be held to have only a provisional solution. 
Scientific method, accurate measurement, and controlled 
experimentation must come in the field of classroom meth- 
ods, just as they have in the fields of school supervision and 
mental measurement. Experimenting with methods of 
teaching, new or old, does not simply mean “trying them 
out,” and forming individual opinions as to their efficiency 
and usefulness. The experimental method is more than 
 
-P-A-G-E-7
    
EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION vii 
mere trial and error, a fortifying of suspicion and prejudice; 
or mere trial and success, endorsing novelty and enthusiasm. 
Experimentation involves a careful analysis of the factors 
and conditions involved, an attempt to control such factors 
by measurement, and an accurate objective testing of the 
results. The final decision is based on carefully determined 
facts as to the success or failure of a method or plan of work, 
and the final opinion of the teacher is based on facts instead 
of on the authority of some training teacher, or on established 
habits or contagious enthusiasms. 
That we are entering a period of extensive reorganization 
in the aim and content and purpose and method of classroom 
instruction, a period that will be dominated by new civic and 
social purposes and new scientific procedure, seems certain. 
That the result, as it relates to the work of the classroom 
teacher, will be a marked reorganization in methods of 
instruction and the substitution of new and more effective 
procedures for old and wasteful and ineffective ways of 
teaching, also seems assured. To set forth, for the informa- 
tion and guidance of teachers in training and in service, the 
best of the recent experimentation in the field of teaching 
technique, and to point out some of the more important 
directions in which we are now traveling, has been the 
purpose of the writer of this volume. His work represents a 
somewhat new approach to the problem of teaching method, 
and it also marks out lines that many others in the near 
future will follow. That it forms a very useful introductory 
treatment of teaching technique, for students in normal 
schools and colleges as well as for teachers in service, is the 
belief of both the author and the editor of the volume.

  PREFACE 
Tue past decade and a half has witnessed remarkable ad- 
vances in the field of the scientific measurement of pupil abil- 
ity and teaching output, but the “personal equation” of the 
teacher herself we have not as yet learned how to measure. 
This personal element varies so much as to defy uniform 
procedure, and no standardization of a single method will 
ever give satisfactory results, except in very limited ways. 
Conclusions as to methods and plans of procedure that apply 
to the work of one teacher will fail to be binding for another. 
Only by careful experimentation for herself, and with a 
variety of methods, can any teacher reach conclusions that 
will be valid for herself alone. 
Individual experimentation with a variety of teaching 
methods, old as well as new, is the large present-day problem 
of classroom teaching which teachers and supervisors of 
instruction alike face. Success or failure with any one 
method may lie in the method itself, or it may depend on the 
teacher; or one method may be more efficient with one type 
of subject-matter or one type of pupils, and another with 
other types of material or abilities. A teacher and a super- 
visor must alike recognize that one person may succeed with 
supervised study while another may fail. Again, the method 
may succeed well in history for that teacher, but not so well 
as some other general method in arithmetic. This problem, 
the problem of the progressive development of classroom 
teaching by conscious experimentation with a variety of 
teaching methods, is the problem of this book. 
An effort has been made to give clear practical descrip- 
tions of all important general methods of instruction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
  x PREFACE 
An attempt has been made to evaluate each, and to present 
its strength and its weaknesses. This evaluation is based on 
many years of contact with teachers in training in normal 
school and university, in the supervision of practice teach- 
ing, and in extensive observation of experienced classroom 
teachers. During the last three years the writer has spent 
on an average two days a week in the schoolrooms of Los 
Angeles, one of the progressive educational centers which 
has attracted experienced instructors from all parts of 
the country. Such contact has been the inspiration for 
the effort to keep the theoretical explanations as near to 
practical needs as possible. 
In the writing of this book, the inductive development 
point of view has been abandoned. The Herbartian method, 
however, is given its place as one of a variety of general 
methods at the teacher’s disposal. This method was the 
stream of rejuvenation that flowed into American teaching 
theory and practice a generation ago. Its values were so 
great, and its influence has been so widespread, that it has 
been difficult for many writers on method to coérdinate it 
properly with later forces. The attempt to subordinate all 
other general methods as mere helping devices to the 
Herbartian plan has outlived its day of usefulness. How- 
ever, no attempt has been made to make all methods center 
round or contribute to some novel scheme of teaching, such 
as the project method. An effort has rather been made to 
correlate the newer methods as parallel with the older 
methods that still have teaching values. 
The point of view is also taken that the question of meth- 
ods can best be discussed independently. Problems of ad- 
ministration, supervision, objectives, and curriculum-mak- 
ing have only rarely been introduced, and only when they 
seemed to be quite inseparable from the problem of tech- 
nique. This is frankly and as fully as possible a Teacher’s

  PREFACE xi 
Manual. More attention has been given problems of edu- 
cational psychology, but this is necessary because of the 
large dependence of method on this related field. 
The book is primarily intended as an introductory treat- 
ment of teaching technique for normal students in schools 
and colleges, but the teacher in service has also been kept 
in mind. One of the main purposes has been to put such 
teachers in an open-minded and experimental attitude 
toward the problem of method. 
In so far as general method is equally adapted to elemen- 
tary, junior high-school, and senior high-school teaching, 
explanation and illustration have been furnished that will 
make the material applicable to teachers .in training or in 
service at any of the public school levels. While a constant 
effort has been made to illustrate the explanation of methods 
by reference to work in various subjects, an attempt has been 
made to keep the discussion from getting cluttered up with 
any discussion of devices, or by the introduction of model- 
lesson fragments. 
No attempt has been made to present complete biblio- 
graphies for the various methods. A few selected references, 
the best and most accessible general discussions, with an 
occasional reference to some outstanding article in periodical 
literature, have been introduced in the footnotes, and in 
brief lists at the end of each chapter under the heading of 
Parallel Readings. 
For use in the classroom, AssIGNMENTS have been in- 
serted, parenthetically, in various places within the text 
itself. Most of these have been cast in “problem” form, and 
are intended to stimulate supplementary thinking as often 
as supplementary discussion or reading. 
At the end of each chapter there is given a test, utilizing 
the objective and economical devices discussed in Chapter 
XI. These are intended as models for the method there

discussed, as well as for actual testing on the subject-matter 
of thechapter. They thus serve to illustrate one of the most 
important methods a teacher must learn to use if she is plan- 
ning such a series of experiments in method as are suggested 
in these pages for progressive improvement in teaching 
technique.

CHAPTER I 
DANGERS AND VALUES OF TEXTBOOK TEACHING 
Most teaching textbook-teaching. 
1. Why textbooks are used — Compact arrangements of educational 
material — Usually contain teaching helps — Provide uniform edu- 
cation throughout the country. 
2. Some disadvantages of textbook teaching — An individual viewpoint 
— Brief introductory surveys — Often accepted as final authorities. 
The recitation-testing period — The waste in recitation-testing — 
The inefficiency of recitation-testing. 
How to use the textbook — Rapid first reading — A test for compari- 
son of results — Using the Table of Contents — Teach the use of the 
Index — Used as a basis for class discussion — Certain objections to 
this method — Topical recitations on the text— Use as working 
manuals — Use as collateral to supplement class work — The second 
careful reading on assigned questions and problems — Reorganizing, 
or comparative reviews — Other helps furnished by some textbooks. 
Test and study-guide for the chapter — Parallel readings. 
Most teaching textbook-teaching. Most teachers are 
textbook-teachers. This is the result of an American prac- 
tice which has become a tradition, and in some States is 
even required by law, as, for example, in California, where 
all textbooks are chosen by a State board, and the teacher 
must declare under oath, at the end of the school term, 
that she has taught the State textbooks prescribed for her 
class. 
Nearly all teachers begin their teaching by an almost ex- 
clusive use of what may be called the “ textbook-recita- 
tion-testing ” method; some never advance beyond this 8. 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  2 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
stage of book assignments and oral questions. Most 
teachers, even the best, adhere to the oral testing for most of 
their work. However, one of the certain marks of improved 
teaching is the gradual substitution of other methods for 
this common, conventional, oral-questioning grind. 
That textbooks should have such a prominent place in our 
methods of instruction is easily explained, and is, to a very 
large degree, justifiable. The chief purpose of this book is 
to show teachers how they may gradually progress from this 
necessary form of inexperienced instruction to higher levels 
of professional efficiency by substituting, more and more, 
some of the other general methods of instruction that have 
been evolved. The purpose is not merely to give variety to 
instruction and learning, but to improve their effective- 
ness as well. 
Tf the use of the textbook is so universal, and if its use is 
not only justifiable but even necessary, why should we make 
achange? Not because the textbook is used, but because it 
is used as it is — formally, thoughtlessly. The objection is 
not to textbooks as such, but to the method of use to which 
they are generally put, namely, recitation on the textbook 
for the purpose of testing the pupil’s preparation on a for- 
mal, hurried assignment of a few pages. Textbooks may be 
used without wasting the whole “class period” with recita- 
tions intended to test pupils. 
1. Why textbooks are used 
Textbooks will continue to be used in the public schools 
of America for generations to come. There is no device or 
method in sight to supplant them, with the possible excep- 
tion of motion pictures for some phases of a few subjects; 
but textbooks will not continue to be used as they are now 
being used. 
We may briefly enumerate and explain some of the reasons
-P-A-G-E-17
TEXTBOOK TEACHING 3 
for this important place the textbook has in American edu- 
cation.! 
They make inexperienced teaching possible. Universal, 
free, compulsory education, and the relatively low pay of 
our teachers, make inexperienced teaching necessary in this 
country. Throughout our educational history the great 
majority of our teachers have been inexperienced. Inex- 
perience does not merely mean that teachers have not had 
experience in teaching for a number of years; it means they 
have not had the necessary training to fit them to teach. 
Worse still, by inexperience we mean that the teachers do 
not know the subjects they are teaching well enough to pre- 
sent all the facts and rules the children must learn, or to 
organize them in a wise way so that the presentation will be 
logical or learnable or effective. At the present time, in the 
United States, speaking of the country as a whole, a large 
proportion of our rural teachers have not had better than a 
sixth-grade education, and many have never been to high 
school. Even in the towns and cities many of the elemen- 
tary teachers have not graduated from a two-year normal 
school, and only a very small percentage have had a better 
education than this modicum. 
For such teachers — the best some communities are able 
or willing to pay for —- the textbook makes teaching possi- 
ble. Why? 
Textbooks, compact arrangement of educational material. 
A textbook may be defined as a logical or a pedagogical ar- 
rangement of some recognized unit of subject-matter for the 
school curriculum. A textbook is a condensed book, giving 
the fundamentals of some subject. Usually it is an intro- 
ductory book, giving in brief form, and as a sort of intro- 
duction, a general survey of some subject. During past

-P-A-G-E-18
  4 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
periods the knowledge that each new generation needed to 
know about the past social progress and methods of solving 
life problems has gradually been divided into “units” or 
subjects, such as arithmetic, geography, or history. Put 
another way, the materials necessary to perform some neces- 
sary particular phase of human activity, such as spelling or 
grammar, have been collected as a school “subject,” or a 
recognized division of the educational courses of study. 
This has been true for elementary schools, high schools, col- 
leges, and professional schools. In many cases the “sub- 
jects” were still too extensive to be studied in a single se- 
mester, or even a school year. Then the successive text- 
books have been “graded” by dividing them into units of 
varying degrees of difficulty. Sometimes they have merely 
been divided into sections of so many pages to a grade. 
Until rather recently, nearly all textbooks were made by 
men who were specialists in the subject on which they were 
writing. Such specialists, knowing little about elementary 
or high-school pupils, and greatly influenced by their special 
knowledge, strove to get out introductory books for use as 
school textbooks that should be not only compact or con- 
densed, but complete as well. The natural thing to do in 
writing such a textbook was to arrange it logically, which 
meant to treat every topic as fully as its relative importance 
in the subject seemed to demand, and to treat it in that 
place where it naturally seemed to come in the subject. 
Recently it has been discovered that logical treatment is 
not always the best arrangement for pedagogical purposes. 
Complete treatment often confronts the child with problems 
for which he has not the remotest need, and in which he has 
not the slightest interest. Logical arrangement often con- 
fronts him with abstract problems long before he is capable 
of understanding them. As an illustration of both, we may 
recall the old formal grammars. As an illustration of the
-P-A-G-E-19
  
TEXTBOOK TEACHING 5 
latter, we may think of the forbidding beginnings of the 
geographies of the last generation, with their astronomical 
first chapters. One of the most notable reforms in school 
work in recent years has been the change made in textbooks 
from logical to pedagogical arrangement, and the grading of 
material in relative difficulties to fit the abilities of the devel- 
oping child. 
Out of the foregoing discussion we may trace two further 
reasons why textbooks are used so widely in this country, 
and why their use is justified. 
Textbooks usually contain teaching helps. It is not 
merely in the fact that the content of a textbook is a com- 
pact presentation of fundamentals that it is such a conven- 
ient device, especially for the inexperienced teacher. Some 
authors, and in recent years practically all writers of text- 
books for the public schools, have consciously tried to intro- 
duce helps for the teaching of the subject. We may merely 
enumerate some of these: 
a. Topic headings. 
b. Helpful outlines, indexes, and tables of contents. 
ce. Questions for “recitation-testing” on each lesson or chapter. 
d. Divisions into daily lessons. 
e. Supplementary references for teachers or pupils. 
f£. Introductory explanations to teachers for use of the book. 
g. Pictures, maps, and diagrams. 
h. Illustrative exercises. 
i. Appropriate problems to be solved. 
j. All manner of typographical devices to arrest attention and 
indicate emphasis. 
k. Occasional review exercises. 
1. Directions to pupils. 
AssiGNMENT: ! Expand this list as fully as you can by examining 
two or three elementary textbooks. 
1 Assignments of this nature, calling for applications of the principles 
discussed, are inserted at a number of placesinthetext. The instructor can 
use as many of these for individual or group work as seem advisable for the 
time available for the course.

  6 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Textbooks provide uniform education throughout the 
country. This has many desirable features. One of the 
phases of school work that has helped greatly in the advance- 
ment of public education is the widespread use of a common 
grading system, under which elementary and high-school 
work is divided into twelve years, either by the 8-4 plan, or 
by the newer 6-3-3 plan where junior high schools are main- 
tained. In each of these years, especially the first eight, 
very much the same work is now done in each school year or 
half-year in most of our States. This has made it possible 
for superintendents, principals, teachers, and school boards 
to make comparisons of and improvements in their work, as 
a result of dividing and identifying common problems in 
buildings, equipment, materials, and methods of teaching. 
It has had a reciprocal effect on the textbooks themselves, 
so that more and more they are being fitted to various recog- 
nized school grades. It has helped in problems of testing 
and promotion, as it has made easier the transferring of 
children from one school to another, or their moving from 
one place to another, and their proper placement in their 
new schools. This is an important element in a country 
with a population that moves about from State to State as 
much as does ours. 
This uniformity has also made it possible for each of the 
States, all of which are independent in their control of edu- 
cation, to regulate, by legislation and administration, many 
important matters that have contributed to the advance- 
ment of education to its present high level. 
ASSIGNMENT: 
1. Find further advantages of uniformity in education in the 
United States. 
2. Compare certain advantages in school systems like those 
of France and Germany which have a still greater degree of 
uniformity through central national control.
-P-A-G-E-21
  TEXTBOOK TEACHING q 
2. Some disadvantages of textbook teaching 
The argument not all on one side. We should also note in 
this connection some of the disadvantages of this common 
use of textbooks in American education. America is quite 
unique in this method as compared with some of the other 
leading nations. The contrast has often been pointed out, 
in this respect, between American and German methods, 
because, before the World War, German education was com- 
monly recognized as the most efficient in the world. The 
German schoolmaster was not inexperienced or poorly pre- 
pared, as so many American teachers were. In that coun- 
try, where “authority” held such high place, the teacher 
did most of his school work by lecture, and by oral group 
drill. Many American educators have spoken of this con- 
trast as an advantage for the American learner. A state- 
ment from Dr. Judd ! on this matter may be taken as typical. 
The advantages of the European method are that the pupils be- 
come trained, attentive listeners, and are able in answering ques- 
tions to talk coherently for long periods, imitating the continuous 
discourse of the teacher. The disadvantages are that the informa- 
tion supplied is limited by the individual teacher’s training, and the 
pupils cultivate little or no independence in the collection and sift- 
ing of information. The influence of the teacher is always dominant 
— often oppressively so. 
The contrasting results of the American method are 
stated by the same writer in a later paragraph: 
The social consequences of this emphasis on reading can be seen 
in the fact that public opinion in America is controlled largely by an 
appeal to the people through reading matter. The importance of 
this kind of public opinion can hardly be overemphasized. In a 
democracy there must be ability to form independent opinions, and 
this is possible only where there is the widest training in reading.

  8 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
It is, however, just in this connection that we may find 
some of the serious disadvantages of textbook teaching if it 
is not properly guarded against. These may be shown in 
brief series. 
The text presents an individual viewpoint. The text- 
book usually presents some individual point of view as to 
values, emphasis, and logical arrangement. The multiplic- 
ity of textbooks in any one subject is not alone due to the 
fact that the knowledge in every school subject is constantly 
increasing and expanding, so that books need revision or 
fall out of use because they are out of date. Nor is the vari- 
ety due to the fact that there are a number of big textbook 
companies competing for the valuable school market, each 
offering its text for every school subject. The multiplica- 
tion of books is due rather to the individual viewpoint of 
authors and teachers as to the relative importance of the 
various topics in any subject, and the best method of pre- 
senting each. For example, there is hardly a single thought- 
ful teacher of English composition who has not yearned to 
get out his own textbook. So it has been, to a greater or 
less degree, in practically every school subject. Nearly 
every textbook writer, as a specialist in his subject, has had 
some hobby, or several, and so we cannot be sure that any 
textbook presents a well-balanced, unprejudiced survey of 
its field. The writer of an American history will have one 
sort of a story to tell of the Civil War if he is of the South, 
and a very different story if he is of the North. Medieval 
and modern histories, written by a Catholic or a Protestant 
writer, present a strange contrast in their interpretation of 
great events involving the religious conflicts of these divi- 
sions of the Christian Church. There is not a school subject, 
hardly a topic even in the fundamental subjects, that does 
not take the color of its author’s convictions. 
Brief introductory surveys. Further, the textbook, even
-P-A-G-E-23
  TEXTBOOK TEACHING 9 
at its best, is only a brief introductory survey. It covers so 
wide a field that it does not pretend to be intensive. Yet it 
is toe often accepted by teachers, as well as pupils, as a com- 
plete, exhaustive treatment of its field. We seldom realize 
that the textbook writer is usually some second-rate author- 
ity, who is merely compiling for teaching convenience a 
bare outline of some phase of knowledge, its outstanding de- 
tails gathered from whole libraries of research. A pupil is 
harmed who is left with the impression that, when he has 
completed his textbook, he has completed his study of that 
subject. The proper corrective for such a misunderstanding 
will be dealt with in some of the later chapters. 
Textbooks often accepted as final authorities. Perhaps 
the greatest danger in the use of textbooks lies here. It 
ought not to be difficult to show that the textbook is just as 
unfavorable to the development of independent thought as 
is teaching by oral authority, as practiced in German and 
other Continental schools. The school environment, with 
its docile attitude on the part of the learner and encouraged 
by the teacher, is unfavorable for the development of inde- 
pendent thinking. Our schools have developed a gullible, 
credulous, slavish generation of readers. As evidence of this, 
the most fantastic, hurried, and inaccurate yarns of the news- 
paper reporter are taken for truth by the great majority of 
readers. They have not been taught to challenge what they 
read. Still more, they have, not intentionally, been so 
trained that any statement in print is immediately accepted 
without question. A printed page is a fetish for most of us; 
we reverence it as inspired; we can hardly disbelieve the 
most palpable contradictions even when they appear on the 
same page. 
There are certain factors in the criticism and interpreta- 
tion of a book, sometimes employed by thoughtful adult 
readers, that would not be out of place for the teacher of a

textbook to follow in her work. We sometimes, before be- 
ginning a new book, ask: “Who is the author?” “What au- 
thority has he to be writing on this subject?” “Why should 
I consider his point of view?” “Would his arguments or 
conclusions be worth anything?” or, “Is he prejudiced, or 
unbiassed?” Before we begin his book, we may study some- 
what about the author. We let him also have his own say: 
We read his preface and introduction to see what he claims 
for his effort, what intention he has. Then we read reviews 
and criticisms to see what others, whose opinions we value, 
think of his work. We are sometimes moved to this after 
reading a book which has stirred us greatly. 
It would, perhaps, be not unwise to advise that teachers 
should develop in pupils this challenging attitude in their 
approach to print, this reflective attitude after reading. 
How this critical feeling may be developed in its best form 
will be one of the methods illustrated in the following chapter 
on Collateral Reading. 
The recitation-testing peril. The most serious disadvan- 
tage of all in the use of textbooks, amounting to a real dan- 
ger, a shameful waste, an almost criminal inefficiency, lies in 
the formal, mechanical use of a textbook as furnishing mate- 
rial for a daily grind of recitation-testing. Most children do 
not know how to study most textbooks, unless they are defi- 
nitely and daily directed as to just what to do. One reason 
why such subjects as arithmetic in the elementary school, or 
Latin in the high school, are so often favorite studies with 
willing pupils is because the task presents a well-known — 
one might say almost instinctive — method of attack in 
carrying out an assignment. Subjects such as history or 
geography may be contrasted in this respect. 
The difficulty here lies not in the tastes or attitudes of 
the pupils, but in the indefiniteness of the teacher. The very 
tradition of the centuries-old method in Latin and mathe-
-P-A-G-E-25
    TEXTBOOK TEACHING Wl 
matics, in using the class period for testing pupils on their 
preparation, has, no doubt, influenced our use of the same 
method in all subjects. In later chapters, on Supervised 
Study and on Testing, it will be shown that perhaps even in 
the Latin and the mathematics this traditional method of 
recitation-testing may be far less efficient than some of the 
more recent methods that have been evolved by thoughtful 
leaders. 
We may, at the start, then, raise the question whether it 
is fair or wise to use a textbook unnaturally; that is, very 
differently from the way in which we would use any other 
book. True, it is more compact and condensed, but is this 
sufficient excuse for gnawing through it at the rate of a few 
paragraphs, or at most a few pages, a day, as is often done 
even in high school or college? Put another way, if it may be 
justified in some manuals, such as an arithmetic or algebra, 
which present a host of problems to solve, does this justify 
the same method in geography, history, reading, and liter- 
ature? Why do we pursue this laborious pace? Either be- 
cause every detail must be mastered, or because only such a 
minute quantity can be satisfactorily tested in the usual 
recitation period. Later we shall have occasion to examine 
the evidence as to whether the former alternative is really 
true. Here we may take up the question as to whether the 
type of recitation justifies our limitation of the quantity of 
work done by the pupil in his study periods. 
The waste in recitation-testing. We ought to stop call- 
ing those periods when the teacher meets her pupils “‘reci- 
tations.” The word implies that the period is to be used for 
testing, for having the pupils give back what they have 
learned. It has already been suggested that such recitation- 
testing, which now constitutes the bulk of the school day, is 
highly wasteful. Let us see why. 
It is wasteful of the child’s time and interest in class. Dr.  
-P-A-G-E-26
    12 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Franzen has pointed out! that in dealing with a group a 
teacher must address herself to either the upper or bright 
quarter, to the average half, or to the lower or duller quarter, 
and that when she directs her attention to the middle or av- 
erage group she bores the upper quarter and mystifies the 
lower quarter, while, if she deals with the upper or lower 
quarter, she either mystifies or bores the other three quar- 
ters. This is a serious difficulty arising from the more or less 
necessary grading and classification of children in groups for 
the sake of economy. If the grouping of children of unequal 
abilities is unavoidable, then the wasteful results suggested 
may either be intensified by thoughtless method, or be partly 
overcome by more efficient selection of work in the class 
period. The ideal toward which the teacher should strive 
is surely the best and utmost utilization of each pupil’s time. 
In no exercise is this inequality and its subsequent waste 
so accentuated as in the use of a class period for oral recita- 
tion-testing. The teacher usually has two unfortunate al- 
ternatives in the dilemma following almost every testing 
question. Either (1) the answer is promptly disposed of by 
a ready response from some “hand-waver” in the upper 
quarter, in which case the majority are lost in mystification; 
or (2) a persistent, tireless effort is made to drag a response 
from some unprepared or incapable one in the lower quarter, 
to the boredom of nearly all the rest. Our present tradi- 
tional ideal prefers the latter alternative as the more con- 
scientious procedure. The result has been the wasting of 
genius, the destruction of natural interests in the superior 
group, and the development of a habit of loafing, such pupils 
naturally developing confidence that “bluffing” or the re- 
sponse on the spur of the moment will be quite sufficient to 
keep them abreast of the “recitation-testing” emergencies 
that may come their way.

  TEXTBOOK TEACHING 13 
The inefficiency of recitation-testing. But still further 
objection on the score of inefficiency in such testing may be 
found. Let us suppose for the moment that the above situ- 
ation is grossly exaggerated, and that there are no extremes 
of brightness and dullness in the average class. Or let us 
suppose a class that has been wisely classified into a fairly 
homogeneous group. The use of the class period for oral 
testing would still be inefficient and wasteful. A class of 
thirty would be a small class, as averages go at present. How 
brief would a lesson have to be to get an effective oral test on 
the whole, or even on most of it, from every child? Of 
course, “that isn’t done,” because all but the first few called 
upon to recite could learn their lesson during the recitation 
period. Only about once in two weeks would each child be 
caught by chance among the early victims! To avoid this 
kind of waste we resort to the theory of sampling. Every 
child is called on for his tiny bit of the whole. Again the 
child is fairly safe on the law of chance with only a partial 
preparation, on a shrewd guess at the teacher’s system in 
calling for recitations, or by conspicuous volunteering at the 
auspicious moment. 
Why test in such a wasteful, time-consuming, inefficient 
way, when every pupil can be called to account for practi- 
cally the whole of an assignment in a few minutes at the be- 
ginning of the period? This can be done by the methods to 
be outlined in detail in the chapter (XI) on Tests and Exam- 
inations, and the rest of the class period can then be given 
over to a variety of supplementary instruction, or the intro- 
duction of additional fresh material that will hold the atten- 
tion of all. Testing of such a type will be shown to be an 
effective motivation for every pupil’s preparation of the 
whole textbook assignment, and the class period may then 
be utilized in expanding, reinforcing, and applying the text- 
book material by several of the other methods taken up in 
succeeding chapters.
-P-A-G-E-28
    4 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
We have, so far, tried to impress the idea that there is a 
way not to use the textbook, the way in which it is now most 
commonly used. In the next section we must take up the 
positive, constructive side, How to use a textbook. 
8. How to use the textbook 
Rapid first reading. Use it naturally, as you would use 
any other book. This would mean a rapid first reading or 
even skimming for a bird’s-eye view or pre-survey of the 
field of the book as a whole, or of large natural units of the 
book. Probably the latter will be the better plan in using 
any elementary school text. We must note a few natural 
exceptions, of course, such as the working manual in arith- 
metic, or a foreign-language reader. This extreme sugges- 
tion, which will almost strike some as heresy, is intended 
as an antidote to the conventional nibbling and gnawing at 
a few paragraphs or pages a day, in mechanical succession 
—a tradition which has been built up to keep the class 
within the “semester bounds” and at the rate of the aver- 
age or slowest, or to take only so much as can be con- 
veniently handled in the oral testing of the “recitation” 
period. J 
One of the most important phases of book study is the 
getting of a proper perspective at the very beginning — an 
idea of the outstanding points, the main divisions and their 
relationships, and the relative place of various items in a 
related series. The customary assignment of a few pages a 
day in the textbook prevents this gaining of a proper per- 
spective of the parts as related to the whole. This lack may 
be made up in reviews, after a chapter or an extended sec- 
tion has been completed, but it will be far more helpful to 
get such a bird’s-eye view of the material at the beginning. 
The natural chapter divisions in history and geography, in 
reading work and in English literature in the upper grades
-P-A-G-E-29
TEXTBOOK TEACHING 15 
and high school, and in all science work, should thus be re- 
spected in the first reading of new material. 
AssicnMENT: Make a lesson-plan or study-guide for one or two 
chapters, in a particular textbook for an elementary or high- 
school class, that will apply the suggestions made in this 
section. 
A test for comparison of results. How much pupils can 
get out of such a preliminary skimming or first natural read- 
ing will surprise most teachers if they have never tried it. 
An experiment that ought to be convincing may be sug- 
gested. Let us suppose a class about to begin the study of 
a chapter that contains enough material for five or more av- 
erage lessons of the common type. After the teacher has 
studied Chapter XI of this book, dealing with Tests and 
Examinations, let her prepare a test, using the various de- 
vices shown there, on the experimental material, and a par- 
allel test with practically the same types of testing for the 
next chapter. Now proceed to the teaching of the first 
chapter in the old-fashioned piecemeal way and give the test, 
before reviews, as soon as the work is completed. For the 
second chapter let the pupils have the first class period for 
reading, and at the close tell them to complete the reading of 
the rest of the chapter by the next day. Give the test on 
this chapter at the beginning of the next period, and com- 
pare the class averages on the two tests. It will also prob- 
ably be profitable to compare the individual scores made on 
the two tests. 
Unless the teacher has been unfair to the experiment by 
unduly stressing in the recitation periods the questions she 
has made out for the first chapter, there will probably be a 
revelation as to how much children get in a single reading, 
and how little more they get by supposedly intensive pre- 
paration and recitation on a few pagesaday. The teacher 
need not feel unduly alarmed if the average on the “super-
-P-A-G-E-30
  16 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
ficial reading” method is even higher than the average for 
the “intensive study.” This will especially be a likely result 
if each test includes a question or two related to the “enum- 
eration” of principal divisions or outstanding organization. 
Using the Table of Contents. Teach pupils how to use 
the “Table of Contents” of any textbook that is provided 
with a proper one. This is true of very many of the newer 
textbooks. The ability to judge the value and scope of a 
book, in adult life, is one of the most valuable bits of tech- 
nique that the schools can teach, and one that is not com- 
monly taught. Extensive experience and tests of college 
students along this line have revealed little evidence of this 
ability. If an author has done a conscientious piece of work 
on his “Table of Contents,” if, in other words, the book is 
well organized, the use of this outline and constant reference 
to it by the pupils in their first reading, and in their reviews 
of extended sections, will yield two valuable results. 
Such constant reference from the text to the author’s out- 
line will furnish a condensed scheme of associations that will 
help the pupil to classify and retain, in organized form, much 
of the material he has studied. 
Work once gone over in this way can be reviewed econom- 
ically by the pupil. Reviews made with reference to a 
“Table of Contents,” which has been made a center of asso- 
ciations, can be made without a complete re-reading of all 
the text. Similar help will be obtained if the topics of the 
“Table of Contents” are introduced as black-faced topics in 
connection with their appropriate paragraphs in the text. 
The technique of these processes should be consciously 
taught, and the pupils should be made to understand the 
value of such procedure in their study. 
This technique may even be elaborated, if desired, by 
showing the pupils the value of underscoring key sentences, 
or important individual items in a paragraph; or the pupils
-P-A-G-E-31
  TEXTBOOK TEACHING 4 
may be taught to insert their own topics on the margins, if 
these are not given in the text. Both these suggestions, of 
course, assume that the textbook is the pupil’s own pro- 
perty. 
Teach the use of the Index. Teach the pupils how to use 
the alphabetical Index of a book. The values and purposes 
in the use of the alphabetical Index, at the end of a book, are 
very different from those of the “Table of Contents,” usu- 
ally placed at the beginning. The Index serves two distinct 
purposes: (1) As an aid to find quickly particular items; 
(2) As a help in bringing together all references in a book 
to any topic. The alphabetical arrangement is an aid to 
facilitate both purposes of reference. 
The use of the Index for the former of these purposes may 
be taught by occasional exercises, either when an emergency 
in the class demands it, or by set exercises given the children 
now and then. This is merely intended to demonstrate to 
them the economy of time in finding particular items of in- 
formation. To make the habit useful, as a permanent one, 
the pupils should be given some practice in finding items in 
those sections of the book which they have not yet studied. 
Otherwise, the natural thing to do is to turn to the approx- 
imate place and run it down by glancing at the context. It 
is just this wasteful method of search that the Index intends 
to make unnecessary, a fact which many of us have not 
learned to take advantage of, if we have had any previous 
acquaintance with a book. For this type of particular refer- 
ence pupils should learn that the Index should be a first 
resort, and not a last resort. 
The second purpose of the Index may be put to a further 
use, especially as a basis for certain types of review work. 
This will usually provide a helpful reorganization of ma- 
terials. An illustration from American history will perhaps 
serve best to show the possibilities. In working through the
-P-A-G-E-32
  18 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
history the pupils will come upon a great deal of detached 
information about such general topics as “slavery,” or the 
“tariff.” ‘These will be scattered along the story, in chron- 
ological order, usually being placed by epochs or adminis- 
trations. Helpful unifying reviews on these and similar im- 
portant problems may be made by using the various refer- 
ences under them in the Index, and by following the page 
references in order throughout the book. 
Using the text as a basis for class discussion. Explain, 
interpret, and discuss the textbook in the class period. This 
method of using the textbook is quite like the conventional 
recitation, as far as conducting the period is concerned, ex- 
cept for the fact that textbooks are open. The activity is 
intended as directed, codperative study — not as testing. 
The teacher takes a prominent part, pointing out main di- 
visions and important points, asking questions, giving inci- 
dentally considerable supplementary information, or restat- 
ing and clarifying the statements of the textbook. The 
pupils follow in their texts by reading silently sentences or 
paragraphs as directed from time to time, answering ques- 
tions to show their understanding, and raising questions 
when they do not understand. 
If choice had to be made between this method of using the 
textbook, and the assignment of outside work to be followed 
by the “‘recitation-test,” this method would be preferable as 
far as learning results are concerned. The same simple ex- 
periment suggested above, could be tried out by any teacher 
who is skeptical on this point. The use of this method does 
not, necessarily, preclude the assignment of work for study- 
hour or home-study. The assignment can be devoted to 
collateral reading. 
Certain objections to this method. One objection may, 
however, be valid. This method is not productive of self- 
reliance in the pupil’s study. The exclusive use of this plan
-P-A-G-E-33
  TEXTBOOK TEACHING 19 
of using the textbook would certainly be inadvisable. If the 
outside assignments, though, are such that a pupil will be held 
to rigid account, by tests and reports, the proper experiences 
in self-directed study will be secured and much more ground 
may be covered. This class-period explanation-and-study 
method may also be intentionally adapted to the pupil’s 
consciously acquiring important elements in study tech- 
nique. Larger emphasis may be put on the silent-reading 
of paragraphs for definite answers to questions given out. 
Aside from this conscious emphasis on proper study tech- 
nique, the teacher will also have to prepare carefully and 
conscientiously for the class period. The successive steps of 
the lesson, the questions to be asked, and the supplementary 
information to be given must all be carefully thought out 
and planned in advance. Unless the teacher has had a wide 
experience and is thoroughly familiar with the field, and 
unless she is very familiar with the textbook, careful prepar- 
ation alone will save the class exercise from becoming a halt- 
ing, formal affair, with little interest and no satisfactory 
progress in it. Individual pupils’ reports on supplementary 
topics may sometimes be introduced in their proper setting 
in such an interpretation and study period, although most 
collateral work in the public schools can best be done after 
the pupil has first studied the textbook synopsis. In some 
subjects suitable collateral topics are sufficiently detached 
not to require this background. 
Having topical recitations on the textbook. This was one 
of the earliest innovations in, and protests against, the old 
question-and-answer testing-type of recitation. Advocates 
of the topical recitation called attention to the waste of the 
old method, especially the evil of “yes” and “no” questions, 
the fragmentary-sentence habit, the lack of practice in or- 
ganized response, and the stranding of many a class period 
in the shoais and shallows of the unprepared and incapable.
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
The evident sections of the assignment are, in this method, 
designated as topics for extended, independent recitations. 
The pupil is given a more definite and concrete ideal to work 
for, and he is given, in the class period, a valuable series of 
experiences in social expression, especially if he has to come 
before the class to tell about his topic. The method moti- 
vates a more thorough preparation, and, if the teacher gives 
the proper suggestions, teaches the advantages of simple out- 
lines as an aid to clearness and completeness. 
The disadvantage in using the textbook for such purposes 
lies in the fact that all of the audience is as fully informed as 
the speaker. This destroys some degree of possible interest 
in the recitations, although attention can be held by having 
each topical recitation followed by a few supplementary 
statements from volunteers as to omissions and inaccuracies 
that were made. There may be some objection to this on 
the score that criticisms of this type may tend to inhibit the 
freedom of such recitations as expressional exercises, but a 
spirit may be developed in the class which will meet this 
difficulty for all except those who are consistently poor in 
their preparation or of very limited ability. The disadvan- 
tage to these few must be weighed against the general ad- 
vantages of this method over the question-and-answer test- 
ing period. 
Using certain textbooks as working manuals. It must 
have been evident to the reader that textbooks were princi- 
pally thought of here in connection with content or informa- 
tional subjects. The textbook in certain subjects is of an 
entirely different type; it is intended as a working manual. 
This is true almost wholly of arithmetics, and of all mathe- 
matics textbooks in high-school courses. It is true of large 
parts of the spellers and language books in the grades, and 
commonly of the composition and rhetoric texts in the high 
school.
-P-A-G-E-35
TEXTBOOK TEACHING 21 
But even in connection with such subjects the recitation- 
testing evil has come in. This may be strikingly illustrated 
in the case of the composition manuals and rhetorics, as 
often used in English classes. These textbooks were intended 
as working manuals and reference books, although many of 
them devote disproportionate amounts to the explanatory 
material. It is not an uncommon thing to find teachers us- 
ing such books as material to be learned and recited on, in- 
stead of showing pupils how to use them for reference in ap- 
plying the principles of rhetoric to their composition work. 
This is partly the fault of the textbook itself, and several 
recent composition books * have avoided this evil by largely 
omitting the theoretical discussions. 
Using the textbook as collateral study to supplement 
class work. This method must not be confused with the 
use of several textbooks for collateral reading to the pre- 
scribed textbook used by the class. This latter method will 
be discussed fully in the next chapter. 
The method here advocated is adapted to the use of older 
students only, beginning in the high school, or possibly in 
such a subject as history in the upper grades. The student 
is left entirely alone in his responsibility for the use of the 
textbook. Tests on considerable sections, several chapters, 
are given once every week or two. The study of this core of 
material is then taken for granted as a background for the 
class-period activities, which are filled as full as possible with 
supplementary experiences. This has been found an effec- 
tive method in college work, where the class period is then 
commonly taken up with lectures on new material, or with 
reports on individual collateral reading by the students. 
Leaving the student alone with the textbook, with a gener- 
1 Hitchcock, Practice Manual; Oldham, A Laboratory Manual of English 
Composition; and Miller, Practical English Composition, are good examples 
of this type of working manual. 
‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  22 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
ous time-allowance for preparation, and with the prospect of 
a strict accounting to be made in the periodical written 
quizzes or tests, makes it possible to cover twice as much 
material as could be covered if each class period were used 
for oral testing. Little class time need be taken for the 
written tests if the methods outlined in Chapter XI are 
followed. 
This use of the textbook will not be beyond the ability and 
responsibility of any high-school pupil, if specific study- 
guides are made out. A half dozen questions and direc- 
tions will usually be sufficient for a chapter of fifteen to 
twenty pages. Tell the pupils definitely and frankly what 
you want them to get, and how thoroughly they must mas- 
ter some points. Considerable time can be saved if such 
study-guides can be mimeographed and distributed; the 
next best alternative is writing them on the blackboard to be 
copied into notebooks. If mimeographing cannot be had, 
some care with one set of loose-leaf notebooks, to be handed 
in one semester, may supply material to be handed out to 
the next class, if the same textbook is used. 
It is even possible, by this method, with some adjustment 
in the study-guides and test questions, to have different 
pupils of a class use different parallel textbooks. 
A second careful reading on assigned questions and pro- 
blems. This is a natural complement to the first-reading or 
skimming method, described on page 14. This first reading 
was for the purpose of getting a proper perspective, and for 
the discovery of main points, important passages, items of 
special interest, and the noting of difficult sections. Sim- 
ilar analysis of the assignment should previously have been 
made by the teacher, partly from the pupils’ point of view as 
far as she can put herself in their place, and partly from the 
point of view of her greater experience and maturity in eval- 
uating the relative importance of the various elements. This
-P-A-G-E-37
  TEXTBOOK TEACHING 23 
must now be presented to the pupils in the form of a study- 
guide of questions, problems, and suggestions, similar to 
that outlined in the preceding section.! 
Reorganizing or comparative reviews. These may be 
given at times in relation to parallel textbooks or other ma- 
terial used in collateral reading. This is merely mentioned 
here in order to make a complete survey of the variety of 
methods that can be used in connection with textbook work. 
The full elaboration of the method may be left for discussion 
in Chapter VIII, dealing with Reviews. 
Here it may be necessary to point out that when a text- 
book has once been covered along lines of its own organiza- 
tion, certain related sections that have been separated by 
that organization may be brought together under some dif- 
ferent unifying principle of their own. In connection with 
the use of the Index an illustration has already been given 
from the field of American history, where it was found that 
the chronological organization common in history texts 
scatters material on certain persistent problems, such as 
“Slavery” or the “Tariff.” Similarly, in geography, we 
usually find the common distributions to be organized by 
continents and countries. A reorganizing review of pro- 
ducts, or industries, or physiographical comparisons will pro- 
vide lines for reorganizing reviews. In the present-day lan- 
guage textbook logical organization is giving way to graded 
exercises, usually proceeding in a sort of cyclical repetition. 
When large sections of such textbooks have been completed, 
especially in the upper grades or the junior high school, val- 
uable reviews may be planned to bring certain related ma- 
terials together, as the scattered elements about the sen- 
tence, or the different parts of speech. 
Other helps furnished by some textbooks. Textbook- 
1 The “Test and Study-Guide” at the close of each chapter in this book 
also illustrates the method.

making is constantly improving its technique. Many recent 
textbooks in the content subjects are now furnishing a vari- 
ety of helps which have been worked out independently by 
progressive teachers. Too often the values to be found in a 
use of these are disregarded. Some books give helpful lists 
of references to collateral reading that have gradually been 
accumulated, and to some extent graded and made public 
by a number of independent workers. Such lists of refer- 
ences are usually the best a teacher can find. Other text- 
books give helpful suggestions as to how and where other 
illustrative material, such as pictures, exhibits, etc., may be 
secured. Others give stimulating questions and problems 
that may often be used as study-guides. Some, notably 
recent language books, give a great variety of suggestions in 
the way of exercises and devices. It is getting to be such a 
common thing now for authors and publishers to get out 
Teachers’ Manuals, with a combination of all such helps, 
that a teacher should make definite inquiry, if she does not 
know, whether such a Manual may be obtained for any new 
book taken up in her classes. 
Asstanment: Make a list of five prominent textbooks in reading, 
arithmetic, history, geography, or some other subject desig- 
nated by your instructor; find out whether a Teachers’ Manual 
is published for it, and list the exact titles of the Manuals.

The different types of tests given here, and at the close of succeeding

completed. For an explanation of these, see Chapter XI.

Importance of reading for adults. One of the most impor- 
tant attitudes we must instill in our pupils is the determina- 
tion to derive all the possible improvement and enjoyment, 
in every phase of life, that can be secured by constant, 
varied, purposeful reading. 
One of the most important habits we must build up in our 
pupils is the habit of extensive, rapid, useful reading. 
One of the most valuable skills the schools can and should 3,
-P-A-G-E-43
  USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 29 
give children is skill in finding readily all accessible material 
in books and magazines, on any desired topic, or on any sub- 
ject of value or of interest. We must prepare every school 
child for the adult day of independent literary research or 
recreation, and we have left undone our most important 
duty as educators if any child leaves school unable to use 
books and libraries. 
This involves summarizing the importance of reading for 
the average adult. In studies of school objectives as related 
to preparation for life 1 we find reading as having very great 
significance from the possible vocational, civic, and recrea- 
tional uses to which it may be put. 
Suppose we assume that a man earns his living by an oc- 
cupation in which reading is unnecessary. If he has not 
learned to read and has not learned how to read, he has 
been trained merely to exist. He is unfit to function in 
vital social relationships, and unequipped to enjoy one 
of the most valuable means of leisure recreation. With 
the development of plays and games and the extension 
of the moving picture, we may even waive the third of 
these great values of reading, the recreational, as we have 
waived the vocational for some. But we cannot ignore 
the social; let the civic phase alone be used to illustrate 
our argument. 
Questions of political importance in a democracy have to 
be settled by majorities. They will be settled by ignorance, 
by misinformation, or by wise decisions based on informa- 
tion. Such information on most problems is avaliable in 
books, magazines, and newspapers. Much misinformation 
is also available in the same sources. Only the extensive, 
comparative, critical reader can worthily prepare himself 
for his civic obligations. The generous public support of 
education can only be defended on the assumption that the 
1 Compare, for example, many passages in Bobbitt, The Curriculum.

    30 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
chief function of the public school is the training of efficient 
citizenship. This aim transcends the vocational, and really 
must dominate it, for the public welfare of the group trans- 
cends the welfare of the individual. 
What constitutes training in reading. It has been inti- 
mated that proper training in reading involves an attack 
on attitudes — an implanting of interests and tastes; that it 
involves the development of a habit of constant and varied 
reading; and that it involves training in the technique of 
efficient information-finding and information-getting and 
assimilating. 
Each of these must be largely developed by extensive ex- 
periences of a similar sort during the school years. Atti- 
tudes have to be developed or encouraged, proper reading 
activities repeated until they become automatic, a tech- 
nique of research must be developed to the state of effective 
independence. 
This cannot be developed by the frugal, laborious use of a 
few books, no matter how compact or fundamental they may 
be. The study of textbooks alone cannot serve this purpose. 
The study of textbooks in almost every subject must be ac- 
companied by the liberal use of supplementary or collateral 
reading. As a school exercise, this collateral reading must 
always be consciously directed toward the development of 
attitudes, habits, and technique. 
Supplementary vs. collateral reading. The term “sup- 
plementary” reading is used in various connections and 
with different meanings in the several phases of school work. 
The elementary teacher of reading often uses the term “sup- 
plementary readers” for books used by pupils outside of the 
common reader used by the class. These are other books of 
the same sort, used for the same purpose, to give additional 
reading opportunities and experiences, but the content of a 
class reader and of a supplementary reader may have noth-
-P-A-G-E-45
USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 31 
ing in common except an approximately equal grade of 
difficulty. 
A high-school English teacher commonly uses the term 
“supplementary reading” for that group of classics read in 
connection with literature classes that are not intensively 
studied together in class. The term is then commonly used 
as an alternative for “outside reading” or “home reading.” 
Again there is no necessary relation between such reading 
and a classic that may furnish the intensive work for the 
common class exercise. Such supplementary reading is now 
usually selected from rather extensive lists to meet the in- 
dividual interests of members of the class, and reports or 
tests on the reading are usually individual affairs. 
A third sense of “‘supplementary reading” is implied in 
its more common synonym, “collateral reading,” which is 
the type of reading specially intended in this chapter, and 
for which the latter term will be exclusively used in the 
further discussion of this method. “Collateral reading” is 
intended as extending or developing the pupil’s information 
about selected topics dealt with in the meager compendium 
of the textbook. The most familiar type, and perhaps the 
original form of it, may be seen in the history classes. Fur- 
ther, detailed information, and a different, possibly a con- 
flicting, point of view is desired for some topics; possibly 
events perforce omitted in the condensed textbook outline 
must be supplied; or original sources and documents must be 
consulted to clothe the skeleton, or to give an atmosphere 
of reality. This method of comparing parallel accounts, or 
providing additional information in the interests of com- 
pleteness, clearness, and reality, has been adopted from the 
history teacher’s technique with effective results in other 
“content” subjects of school work, such as geography, lit+ 
erature, and the various sciences.  
-P-A-G-E-46
  32 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
1. Various kinds of collateral reading 
It may be helpful to identify some of the various kinds of 
collateral reading that may be done, for from them we may 
develop the idea that such reading may be done with various 
purposes, and that an accounting for such reading may be 
made by the pupil in various ways. 
Parallel textbooks. One of the common forms of collat- 
eral reading is the use of parallel textbooks. This is largely 
in the interests of clearness, or of completeness on a limited 
scale. Different authors have varying success in their ap- 
peal to the child’s interests on different topics. The style of 
one may appeal to one child; another may make his meaning 
clearer to others. Helpful maps and illustrations may be 
found in one text that are not found in another. One au- 
thor’s outlines may be superior; another may excel in help- 
ful questions or problems; limited extensions of material on 
certain topics may be useful in other texts. Possible contra- 
dictions, or conflicting points of view, may serve to set be- 
fore the pupil material for reflection and solution. 
The parallel textbooks present the easiest and most nat- 
ural beginnings for a school library. The teacher’s own 
proper preparation often implies her possession of such ma- 
terial. It has the advantage, usually, of being graded to the 
same level of ability as that required for the class textbook, 
and herein lies one of the difficulties that has to be met by 
the teacher in selecting collateral reading from other sources. 
Frequently this is too mature for the pupil’s use. The recent 
remarkable development of children’s encyclopedias is a 
good illustration of the difficulties pupils have encountered 
in the use of standard works of reference. 
Asstcnment: Assume that you are going to teach a specific 
lesson in a specific textbook in geography, or American history. 
Show what use you could make of “collateral” material in two 
or three other textbooks, and why you would use that material.
-P-A-G-E-47
  USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 33 
The fragments of such collateral material may often be 
presented to the class directly by the teacher, either in the 
form of telling or reading. Other passages should, however, 
be left to be read by the pupils themselves, especially if they 
contain training-possibilities beyond the mere information 
conveyed, or the superior clearness or force of parallel ex- 
planations. 
General works of reference. The most ready source of 
collateral information for the adult in his reading is the 
encyclopedia, or similar works of general reference. Their 
value for this purpose, and they have this same value for 
readers in training, lies in the alphabetical arrangement 
which makes all of their contents so easily accessible. By 
alphabetical order, by cross references, by indexes, and by 
similar devices, the material related to any topic can be 
found at once. 
Which of these works are of greatest recognized value? 
With which of them, as to content and method of use, should 
the average reader become familiar in his school days? 
With which of the following works of general reference are 
you familiar? Which would you consider most desirable 
for a school library for the specific work of your grade or your 
special subject of instruction? Do you know the relative 
merits, for your prospective line of school work, of these 
standard works of reference?

34 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
More detailed accounts of special topics. Textbooks, as 
we have seen, are intended to give only a compact summary 
of fundamentals. Such books are gotten up for use through- 
out the whole country. In the interests of completeness of 
outline it is inevitable that no single topic can be given very 
extended treatment. Most of the elementary geographies 
well illustrate this point. Read the sections dealing with 
the countries of Europe. We find the limitations of space so 
cramping to the writers that most of the large cities of any 
country have to be dismissed with a sentence or two. Some 
sections read more like a catalogue than a child’s reader — 
intended to give information but failing to give enough infor- 
mation to arouse interest. In one place, or at any one time, 
one country or city may be important in current news and 
of special interest to children as well as adult readers. Early 
in the World War universal attention was focused on Bel- 
gium and Liége; a few years later every one was interested in 
Asia Minor and Smyrna; a few months later the Ruhr Val- 
ley in Germany and its cities occupied the center of the 
stage. The teacher of geography is missing her greatest op- 
portunity if she does not seize such occasions for stimulating 
a search and a contribution to her class periods of materials 
that will lend reality and promote an understanding of cur- 
rent events, far beyond what could be given by a few sen- 
tences of information contained in the complete, balanced 
compendium of the textbooks. 
We may go beyond the rapidly changing topics of interest 
in current events to show the necessity of constant and intel- 
ligent adjustments and supplements to the core of the class 
work in the textbook. Geography or history, and many 
other school subjects, as taught in any one State or city, 
must always differ in completeness and in the emphasis 
given to certain topics from the treatment given in any 
other place. The teaching of geography in California may 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
    
USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 35 
demand an emphasis and an extension of the textbook’s 
treatment of Mexico or Japan that the geography teacher of 
Illinois would not need to expand at all, while the reverse 
would be true of some other topic. Father Serra is as fa- 
mous in the history of our country in the Californian 
teacher’s eyes as Pére Marquette is to the teachers of Illi- 
nois, Wisconsin, and Michigan, while Columbus is treated 
with equal emphasis in all these States, and with probably 
no different perspective in New England or the South. 
Parallel points of view. Again, a teacher may feel, because 
of the social environment or the economic prospects of the 
class of pupils in her room or in the school, or because of the 
tastes or ambitions of the group, that it may be desirable to 
have an almost constant emphasis on some point of view 
parallel, or even contradictory, to that of the regular text- 
book. She may be teaching a course in general science in 
which the college-preparatory aim is constantly in the mind 
of the author of the textbook. She may feel that it is de- 
sirable, for the sake of interest and motivation, to make a 
constant appeal to the spirit of play or of constructive in- 
genuity, or of practical applications of the more theoretical 
and abstract digest of definitions, principles, and classifica- 
tions or descriptions of the text. Or she may feel that in 
geography the emphasis on locational and political and 
physical facts should have a constant blending and enrich- 
ment with the social side, the life and customs of peoples. 
Or in history, dynastic and military resumés may seem to 
call for a similar vitalizing parallel for every epoch. Such 
collateral materials she may find in the different view-points 
of the authors of one or several other parallel textbooks. 
More often it will have to be supplied from a variety of 
sources. Sometimes single volumes may be found that are 
not intended as textbooks, but are definitely aimed to sup- 
ply a common Jack in all leading handbooks used for regular
-P-A-G-E-50
  36 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
class work. Such a book as H. W. Johnston’s Private Life 
Among the Romans is a good illustration of how this element, 
omitted almost altogether in all Roman history textbooks, is 
supplied in convenient form for collateral use. A whole 
series of geographical readers might be named as intended 
for the same purpose. Books of this sort usually have the 
advantage that they were definitely written with the aim of 
being suited to the reading abilities of school children — a 
factor which is often a serious drawback to the use of the 
best standard and authoritative references that might be 
selected at large. 
Suggestions as to where and how to make up such lists of 
collateral reading, intended for school use, will be given 
later in this chapter. 
Assignment: Make a list of fifty geographical readers intended 
especially for elementary school use. Name several “series” 
you found. Make a list of six topics each of which would be 
suitable for such a reader, and which you did not find in any 
lists. Tell just where you found your list of readers. Examine 
several of the books, and write briefly a criticism of the 
language and content, answering the question, “Is the book 
suited to the abilities and interests of the pupils for which it 
was intended?” 
Reading of sources on which textbooks are based. This 
is another type of collateral that has been developed and 
used largely in connection with the study of history, but 
which is gradually finding its way into other subjects. We 
should also note that the use of such “source books” was 
first developed in connection with college teaching, has been 
quite fully extended for certain types of high-school work, 
and is now finding its representatives in a few elementary 
school courses. Just how far this college method may be 
warranted for use on lower levels of instruction appears de- 
batable to some. The answer probably depends on the 
motive with which it is used. Source books may be intro-  
-P-A-G-E-51
    USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 37 
duced into a course to develop a technique of study — a crit- 
ical, evaluating attitude on the part of students; or to add 
reality and completeness to the matter-of-fact summary of 
the textbooks. Their introduction into high-school work 
was probably intended largely to serve the former, or college- 
preparatory, aim. Such a motive can probably find little to 
commend it in high-school classes, and cannot be defended 
at all in elementary school work. But some source material 
can certainly be justified on any level of school work if it is 
intended to serve the same general purposes we find in any 
other collateral reading. The fact that such material gives 
“original sources’’ lends no special sanctity; interest must 
always be the criterion for its use; and much of such source 
material is forbidding in its maturity and technical detail. 
The text-book synopsis of a law and its workings is probably 
a much more readable presentation, to the elementary and 
high-school pupil, than the law itself or a Supreme Court 
decision relating to the law. 
This same objection does not always follow when second- 
ary sources are concerned. What may be dry-as-dust in a 
chapter in Stubb’s Constitutional History of England may be 
burning with the glow of genius in a paragraph of Macau- 
lay’s History of England. The former may be no help to the 
student of history — the pupil’s textbook is clearer and more 
interesting — but the words of Macaulay may so far exceed 
this impression that the thought may be a lasting inspira- 
tion. 
Reading current literature to bring material up to date. It 
is impossible for textbook makers in certain subjects to keep 
up to date. The amount of time elapsing between the writ- 
ing of a book and its use makes this impossible in some 
subjects. Great events or important discoveries, recently 
piled one on the other, have made the newest histories, 
geographies, and science textbooks partly obsolete during
-P-A-G-E-52
  38 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
the process of publication. Many a child studying Ameri- 
can history has been left with the impression that it all came 
to an end when a Garfield or a McKinley was shot. Changes 
in the maps of the world as a result of the World War have 
made a completely new series of geographies necessary. 
Careful supplementing is necessary in such cases, and the 
materials must largely be supplied by current and periodical 
literature. The purpose of such reading is not only com- 
pleteness and correctness of information, but the learn- 
ing of a wise use of materials necessary for the progressive 
adult to keep in touch with the changes brought by each 
new day. 
Reading to give spirit or atmosphere. Imaginative art 
has made reality more real. Fiction has made history live. 
Travels and fiction again give us an insight into other lands 
that careful, logical, scientific description never yields. The 
eye of the poet and of the novelist have a penetration whose 
insight must be borrowed by the average mind to catch an 
understanding of reality. Scott’s romances may exagger- 
ate, but their spirit and atmosphere give an understanding 
of persons and events that the correct historian can never 
convey. 
It is this artistic imagination at its best, often controlled 
by careful research, that lends such promise of possibilities 
to some school subjects in the use of moving pictures.! Ex- 
pensive laborious reconstructions of far-away scenes make 
the past live for the child and common man as no verbal, 
exact description can. 
A vital impression may be more worth while than a pains- 
takingly accurate one. It is more stirring, more interesting, 
1The new series of historical moving pictures — the “Chronicles of 
America’? — being prepared under the direction of Yale University, and 
which begins with “Columbus,” is an example of a careful blending of 
historic research and artistic imagination. These will soon be available for 
moving-picture houses and schools,
-P-A-G-E-53
  
  USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 39 
more alluring to further study. It is more apt to furnish a 
lasting center of interest. 
A gradual development of such material has become, in 
recent years, a conscious effort. Lists are now available 
that will furnish the teacher a wealth of material of this type. 
AssIGNMENT: Find out the name of the book that gives a list of 
all fiction that is in any way related to the leading events or 
epochs of history. 
AssicNMENT: Make out a list of stories or novels that you could 
use for three of four specific topics in geography, or in history 
for a specific grade. 
A similar type of collateral reading that may be grouped 
with this, in several subjects of the curriculum, is that which 
gives personal sidelights to abstract topics or general move- 
ments. This is found, not in the field of imagination or art, 
but in the field of biography. Some high-school texts in 
mathematics now have portraits and brief sketches of fa- 
mous mathematicians. Science offers a rich field for the 
romance of pioneers and discoverers. Textbooks in history 
often need this vitalizing element to make the abstractions 
of causes and effects, and of eras and movements, really live. 
In literature the biography of the author, or that phase of 
his life which gave birth to a masterpiece, is often indispen- 
sable for its proper understanding. Edited texts, with in- 
troductions, often supply the necessary personal background 
and atmosphere. Likewise historical backgrounds are often 
essential to a proper understanding of some topics in various 
school subjects, and history and geography make important 
reciprocal contributions. 
Readings for present-day comparison and applications. 
There is a variety of opportunities for the teacher to relate 
what is more or less stereotyped, formal, and lifeless in the 
textbook to present-day practical needs and problems. 
Collateral reading must be given to the child to effect the 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  40 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
contact between the remote or abstract, and the current 
values. Other methods for introducing such fresh material 
may be used, such as free discussions and extemporaneous 
contributions by the pupil. The most effective form of in- 
troducing such ideas, to supplement and vitalize the text- 
book, is found in the teacher’s careful anticipation of it and 
in having the pupils prepared to take part, in a more com- 
plete and organized way, by having the necessary reading as- 
signed in advance with the lesson in the textbook. 
The superficial, inaccurate, incomplete chance contribu- 
tion may be the starting point for the discussion of matters 
of current comparison, analogy, or application. The mat- 
ter, though, should not end there. If some spontaneous 
suggestion introduces a topic the teacher has not anticipated, 
it should, if deemed worthy, be treated with dignity and 
appreciation, and be made the subject of further reading 
and subsequent discussion. Such treatment will encourage 
spontaneous suggestion of comparisons and applications, 
and will assure the pupils of interested consideration for 
worthy ideas or experiences. This attitude on the part of 
the teacher will open the door to the pupils’ interests and 
experiences, and, reciprocally, will vitalize class work and 
school study as having practical, living significance. 
Sources for such material must, of course, largely be the 
customary, accessible, current reading of the average child 
in the home or in his school library. The newspaper is per- 
haps the most prominent of this type, with the weekly news 
periodicals only less common, but far more valuable. In 
fact, it is just in this field of current practical applications 
that school study should be connected with the develop- 
ment of current-reading habits, which the school must set 
itself to mould and control, and to develop in such ways as 
to form permanent attitudes and habits. The uses, illus- 
trations, and analogies in current events for illuminating 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 41 
and applying history, civics, geography, science, or any of 
the reading selections, must, therefore, be kept in mind con- 
stantly. 
While the sources are the same here as those mentioned 
above under the heading of up-to-date material, it is evident 
that not the same type of material is used, nor is the same 
purpose served. There it was the selection of material to 
complete the textbook; here it is a question of making com- 
parisons and analogies for the purpose of interpreting either 
the textbook or current events, of making present-day ap- 
plications, or of getting practical illustrations of the more 
formal and abstract material of the textbook. 
2. The purposes of collateral reading 
In the foregoing sections it has been intimated, here and 
there, that collateral reading may have various purposes. 
The teacher will sometimes have one purpose in mind, some- 
times another, sometimes several. Most of these purposes 
involve indirect values, some of which are far more impor- 
tant than the direct values. In fact some of these indirect 
values are so important that they must consciously be a part 
of the teacher’s objectives in every subject. We shall now 
consider the more important of these purposes. 
To enrich minimal requirements of textbook. This is the 
most obvious of all purposes in collateral reading, and may 
be called the direct aim of most of it. It is merely the gath- 
ering of supplementary information — an expansion of the 
textbook along its own lines and for the same purposes. 
To expose “interests” toa broad contagion. This is per- 
haps the most valuable of all the aims in collateral read- 
ing. This exposure will sometimes be intentionally specific; 
sometimes intentionally indirect and general. The former 
contacts will be planned in such a way as to put the pupil in 
touch with the best authorities or the most inspiring writers 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  42 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
on the subject. The extent of such specific, intentional, col- 
lateral reading must vary considerably with the age of the 
student. In college work, such collateral reading is usually 
distributed in any course in such a way as to insure some 
contact with all the leading authorities in the field. But in 
high school, and even more in elementary classes, the in- 
spirational motive, the intention to develop interests in the 
field of study, must be more prominent. The more general 
contact is the encouragement of library “browsing”; mak- 
ing the search for collateral serve the purpose of general in- 
fluence on the reading habit. In this we are merely furnish- 
ing the occasion for natural curiosity to make accidental | 
contacts that may promote reading and the use of libraries as 
a permanent habit, or developing the ability in pupils to find 
information for themselves on any topic. 
Our biographical literature is full of illustrations of men 
who have found their careers and achieved almost independ- 
ent, specialized educations for themselves out of such a pro- 
cess of either random or directed “browsing” in collections 
of good books. The story of Samuel Johnson’s exposure to 
such an opportunity in his father’s book shop is one of the 
classical examples. Many a man can get a cue, in an hour’s 
visit to a well-stocked second-hand book store, for a dozen 
different lives he would wish to live. 
In planning and hoping for the implanting of such an in- 
terest in every school child we may have a narrow pedagog- 
ical motive. We know that a single intellectual hobby may 
be used as a focus of interest in nearly all school work; we 
would have all of our pupils of this type, even though the 
interest be far removed from our own particular field. Such 
pupils can be reached easily, while we strive futilely with the 
dormant or the blasé. 
But one’s vision in planning such exposure must be far be- 
yond the needs of the classroom. Such absorbing special-
-P-A-G-E-57
USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 43 
ities are a fundamental prerequisite for success in life, and 
the earlier they can be roused the more valuable and mean- 
ingful will all school experiences become as contributions to 
a preparation for useful living. 
In the intentional exposures we plan for the child we 
should probably have a fairly well-rounded vision of his 
future. This should include the vocational, the civic, and 
the recreational. Every subject in school has its contribu- 
tion to make to each of these phases of life. Our school prac- 
tice may conform to the current philosophy that “educa- 
tion is not preparation for life, that it is life.” The positive 
phase of this epigram presents a wholesome reaction to 
former practices; the negation of the preparatory side may 
be excused as the natural exaggeration of the reformer. 
The practice of such a philosophy has already resulted in 
pernicious trivialities in materials and methods of school 
work. 
Fortunately the majority of teachers still feel they can and 
should prepare children for a worthy adulthood of inde- 
pendence, service, and leisure. Points of interest, vital 
interests, in each of these three should be consciously ex- 
posed before our pupils in every subject in the curriculum. 
If a subject has no such possible interest values, it will not 
long remain in the course of study. We are making these 
uses, future as well as present, the objective in this method 
of collateral reading, just as we should in any other method 
of instruction we may employ. 
Assignment: Make a list of the vocational, civic, and recrea- 
tional interests that should be awakened or stimulated by a 
particular textbook in a particular grade. 
The “bibliographical” purpose. In the previous section 
it was noted that one of the indirect purposes of collateral 
reading was, especially in advanced courses, to give students  
-P-A-G-E-58
  44 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
“contact with the leading authorities in a particular subject. 
This is one phase, an important phase, of the bibliographical 
method as well, but its possibilities for use in public school 
work must be wisely limited. There are, however, other 
phases of the bibliographical method, especially on the tech- 
nique side, with which even the pupils of the upper elemen- 
tary grades should become familiar through practices of a 
simple sort. 
The making of a bibliography is one of the essentials of 
independent investigation, even though this be of the lim- 
ited sort the average adult may have use for. It simply 
amounts to saying that one should know where to find infor- 
mation on a topic, and how to make a practical selection 
from available lists of material. Making a bibliography is 
not an end in itself; it is not the mere collecting of a complete, 
card-catalogued list of titles dealing with a topic or problem. 
It may be a far simpler operation, and in this sense it is a 
necessary first step to any reading investigation. It may be 
done by proxy, but then this much of the technique must at 
least be a matter of school experience. But the process as a 
process should be consciously acquired. At present most 
high-school graduates, when they confront the necessity in 
college, do not know how to go about the matter. It is one 
of those bits of technique that all teachers on the lower 
levels do not feel a responsibility for, and that teachers on 
the upper level take for granted must have been acquired 
somehow before students come to them. 
Training in bibliographical procedure. Bibliography is a 
matter that can be learned, step by step, and should find a 
place in varying degrees of complexity in connection with 
every subject where collateral reading can be used. The 
manner in which many textbooks are now gotten up makes 
the first step in bibliography work rather simple. The pur- 
pose of “‘lists of references” now given in many texts should
-P-A-G-E-59
  
USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 45 
be explained to the children. The possible use of similar 
references at the end of encyclopedia articles should also be 
understood. Such lists are, of course, selected because all 
material is pertinent to the topic in hand. 
The next step should probably be a using acquaintance 
with the Readers’ Guide. Here the pupil must usually do 
his own selecting from a long list of articles in current liter- 
ature that are closely or remotely related to the topic being 
studied. Actual skimming of the material to select the best 
must be encouraged to give the pupil this second step in 
bibliographical technique. 
The third step, the running down of published bibliograph- 
ical lists and a compilation of likely titles from them, may be 
uncalled for before the advanced work in the high schools. 
Those students preparing for inter-school debates are about 
the only ones who now get adequate training in such study 
technique. Material for practice of this sort can easily be 
made accessible, in any school, by using some of the bibli- 
ographical lists published by different bureaus of the United 
States government. These can usually be secured free. 
The fourth step, the collecting of the complete, classified, 
card-catalogue bibliography, will usually be left for special 
courses in college to develop. 
Teachers of history have usually done most of this bib- 
liographical training of pupils in the upper grades and in the 
high school. There is no reason why this should not also be 
a conscious objective in English courses and in some of the 
other content subjects. A school system that has worked up 
an independent curriculum for its public schools should see 
that the responsibility for training in the successive steps of 
bibliography is assigned to certain grades and subjects in a 
progressive way. In schools where this is not officially pro- 
vided for, each teacher should assume such part of the re- 
sponsibility as her judgment dictates.
-P-A-G-E-60
  46 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Organization of material gathered from various sources. 
‘This might be called the “expressional” purpose. One of 
the objectives in all school subjects should be a broader 
training in what is too commonly left to the language or com- 
position classes. English teachers, though usually arguing 
from a narrow specialized point of view, are right in urging 
the necessity of a more general and more generous codpera- 
tion among all departmental teachers in the matter of com- 
position, both oral and written. The expressional experi- 
ence is as important, from the educative point of view, as 
the impressional. Outlining, telling, and writing are as im- 
portant methods of learning history and geography, and 
science and mathematics, as they are for reading and study. 
Tn fact we have ceased to question the old dictum that “there 
can be no impression without expression.” 
But the expression phase of learning activity must be em- 
ployed and developed for its own sake, as well as for the sake 
of success in learning. The technique of clear, forceful 
speech and writing is one of the general agencies of voca- 
tional and civic efficiency that has been too largely under- 
estimated. The values of persuasion and publicity are no 
longer confined to a few professions. The engineer now 
needs them as much as the minister; the business man no less 
than the lawyer. 
There is a significant factor in this learning of effective 
expression that has often been overlooked. It can probably 
be learned more effectively and naturally as a by-product in 
other school subjects than as a persistent practice in the arti- 
ficial setting of composition classes. The prime essential to 
successful, natural expression is having something to say. 
The teacher of English is often hard put to it to motivate 
composition on the content side. The opportunity for co- 
operation in teaching efficient expression is best met here, 
and involves reciprocal codperation. Instead of having prac-
-P-A-G-E-61
USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 47 : 
tice in expression in English classes deal with artificial ma- 
terials or forced interests, the content of other school sub- 
jects may well be used as one of the pupil’s pressing daily 
needs and uses. If the composition teacher desires codpera- 
tion, she can herself make the most effective first step in 
getting it by giving it. In connection with collateral read- 
ing there is opportunity for the teacher of all subjects to 
get the most effective contributions from the collateral 
sources by insisting and helping the pupils to apply what 
they have practiced in their English work — clear outlin- 
ing, effective reporting from notes, readable synopses, or 
well-digested and properly written compositions. 
Wrong extremes. There are two wrong extremes com- 
monly practiced in connection with assignments in collat- 
eral reading that result in very undesirable practices in the 
expressional activities. One is to assign only a single refer- 
ence for the pupil to report on. This is most commonly the 
case in connection with encyclopedia references, and in such 
work in the elementary schools. The result is a report read 
by the child, usually an abstract or a frank, undigested quo- 
tation of some length, not at all understood by the reader be- 
cause of its mature, condensed, technical vocabulary, and 
consequently of little value as a contribution because the 
listeners get even less than the reader. The simplification of 
encyclopedic knowledge in the children’s handbooks will 
somewhat alleviate this evil, but even they have far to go 
still. 
The other extreme is the assignment of too many refer- 
ences, because they are merely intended for reading and 
not for reporting. A well-chosen list of fewer references, 
which can be reported to the class, would seem to represent 
a more happy medium. The assignment of several comple- 
mentary references will give a natural motivation to proper 
organization of the material selected from several sources;   
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  48 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
the preparation of the material will then involve a more 
thoughtful reaction, and a more satisfactory contribution. 
To develop a critical, comparative, challenging spirit in 
reading. Reference has already been made to the common 
“reverence for print.” Thoughtless acceptance of ideas put 
forth in the daily newspapers — credulity often amounting 
to gullibility — is probably characteristic of the average 
reader. This is evidenced no less by the character of the 
material in the newspapers than by the popular reactions to 
such material. Even the fact that in recent years the news- 
papers seem to have lost their power of leadership in politi- 
cal affairs is merely to be interpreted as evidence of popular 
suspicion of the editorial columns; it is evidence rather of a 
wholesale, unthinking suspicion of all newspapers on polit- 
ical affairs than of thoughtful, critical comparisons of oppos- 
ing sides of important questions. The evidence of the news- 
paper’s dominance of popular thought — the fact that its 
news and specialties play a large part in the common conver- 
sation — can hardly be questioned, and the most remarkable 
phase of this influence is the evidence we have that even 
college-trained people will accept, as facts, the hurried, 
amateurish, uncritical reports in the news columns. Such 
gullibility is not even staggered by conflicting reports or 
contradictions on succeeding days. We never realized the 
extent of this common credulity, and its influence in mould- 
ing public opinion, until we saw, during the War, the whole 
country swayed by waves of propaganda that was later re- 
vealed as intentionally misrepresenting or exaggerating the 
true condition of affairs. The present reaction, of suspect- 
ing most news of political importance as “propaganda,” may 
result in the same sort of impotence for the news columns as 
has long existed with reference to the editorial columns of 
the newspapers. The loss of this power of leadership, this 
influence in moulding public opinion, is highly regrettable.
-P-A-G-E-63
USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 49 
The lost opportunity of the newspaper. This regrettable 
failure of journalism to realize its opportunity of leadership 
and its mission of forming worth-while public opinion by 
informing it honestly might be illustrated by the career of 
many metropolitan journals and journalists. Perhaps no 
more striking illustration could be found than the following 
keen criticism of Lord Northcliffe,! the publisher of the 
famous London Times: 
It is already apparent that for want of balance and a moral 
continuity in his direction of policy Lord Northcliffe has done 
nothing to elevate the public mind and much to degrade it. He has 
jumped from sensation to sensation. The opportunity for a fight 
has pleased him more than the object of the fight has inspired him. 
He has never seen in the great body of English public opinion a 
spirit to be patiently and orderly educated towards noble ideals, 
but rather a herd to be stampeded of a sudden in the direction 
which he himself has as suddenly conceived to be the direction of 
success. 
The true measure of his shortcomings may be best taken by see- 
ing how a man exercising such enormous power, power repeated day 
by day, and almost at every hour of the day, might have prepared 
the way for disarmament and peace, might have modified the 
character of modern civilization, might have made ostentation look 
like a crime, might have brought capital and labor into a sensible 
partnership, and might have given to the moral ideals of the 
noblest sons of men if not an intellectual impulse at least a convinc- 
| ing advertisement. 
But instead, the criticism continues later, 
‘consciously or unconsciously he has traded on the people’s igno- 
Trance, ministered to their vulgarities, and inflamed the lowest and 
| most corrupting of their passions. 
The degradation of journalism in this country since the days 
of the Civil War may perhaps be fairly expressed in the 
charge often made that Northcliffe merely imitated Ameri- 
can journalism, and the criticism applied to him would

-P-A-G-E-64
  50 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
apply equally to many leaders in the newspaper field in this 
country. 
Training in historical criticism. The worthy newspaper 
has a place as a powerful, efficient institution in our modern 
life. Wise social action, in any field, must be based on infor- 
mation. There is no institution or agency that can so well 
supply the information necessary to intelligent decisions. 
As teachers of future citizenship we cannot encourage the 
attitude of wholesale suspicion and prejudice. We must 
rather try to build up in our pupils a technique of careful, 
critical, challenging comparison, and ability to read between 
the lines, a determination to make the most reasonable de- 
cisions from an imperfect or biassed reporting of events, a 
desire to get at truth from half-truths, a weighing of evidence 
in light of the rather constant attitude of the publishers or 
known writers in newspapers and magazines. In short, we 
have to teach our pupils the elements of historical criticism. 
We have to teach them how to treat current material in the 
same simple way that the historian treats his sources. One 
of the most valuable courses that a prospective teacher can 
take in the university, or one of the most valuable lines of 
professional reading she could undertake, would be one of 
the elementary textbooks used in such courses in historical 
criticism in the universities. 
AssicNMENT: Find the names of several such textbooks in 
historical criticism, and report on the topics you find included 
in such a course. 
How can we make a simple beginning in the elementary 
schools, and how best continue in the high schools, this tech- 
nique and attitude of thoughtful, critical reading? Perhaps 
the simplest, most feasible, and most important step to 
guard against this subservient, blind credulity in the printed 
page is by confronting the pupil with conflicting accounts in 
“black and white.” | The field of collateral reading is the
-P-A-G-E-65
* USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 51 
chief means for attaining this. In connection with the use 
of parallel textbooks it has already been pointed out that 
pupils can and should be brought into contact with different 
points of view. Where bias is evident in such individual 
viewpoints, the pupil should be made aware of them, and 
the habit of allowing for them or discounting the prejudiced 
selection or interpretation of facts should be encouraged. 
Sometimes a textbook writer’s generalization may be con- 
fronted with the actual data on which his conclusion is, or 
should have been, based, and the pupil may be shown that 
the conclusion was unwarranted. The opportunity for 
selection of such topics will, of course, be rare, but if the 
teacher discovers such in a textbook they should not be 
overlooked. Interesting and profitable exercises may be 
worked up where different authors draw different conclusions 
from the same data. The conflicting deductions should be 
confronted with the source, and the pupils should be en- 
couraged to select the interpretation they approve. 
The purpose in mind. Perhaps the most interesting exer- 
cises in collateral reading, with this purpose in mind, may be 
found in comparison of any type of controversial current 
literature, and especially conclusions of a partisan nature in 
the field of civics and politics. This will make practice con- 
tacts in the realm where critical reading will be most im- 
portant for the adult. It also has the advantage of being 
more easily obtained. Any two newspapers, of opposing 
policies on social, economic, or political questions, will fur- 
nish daily examples. 
The teacher, in carrying out this purpose in collateral 
reading, must keep one thing clearly in mind. The motive 
is not to develop or encourage wholesale skepticism or sus- 
picion of anything in print, although there are leaders of 
thought at present who would prefer this attitude of univer- 
sal doubt to the other extreme of unthinking credulity.
-P-A-G-E-66
  52 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Possibly we may be justified in going to this opposite ex- 
treme with adult readers or more advanced students. The 
motive should be thoughtful, critical, alert challenge rather 
than general doubt or distrust. It should be the begin- 
ning of open-mindedness — of the attitude of keeping judg- 
ment in abeyance, which Dewey has shown us is one of 
the chief essentials of good thinking. This purpose in col- 
lateral reading should be the beginning of weighing facts 
against authority, of preferring experiment to tradition, of 
valuing one’s own deliberate judgment against the judgment 
of another. It is, in short, the beginning of a reverence for 
independent thinking in place of slavish acceptance of any- 
thing and everything that gets by the printer. 
Acquaintance with types and values in current literature. 
The former purposes in collateral reading will naturally run 
on into this. Out of such exercises as have just been out- 
lined, pupils will gradually be led to accumulate general 
evaluations. Such general estimates will probably be ex- 
pressed in an organized way in the high school, but some 
foundations for conclusions will begin to be laid in similar 
exercises in the upper elementary grades. Perhaps the best 
way to explain this purpose would be a mere enumeration of 
certain objectives the schools should have with reference to 
current literature: 
a. The elementary or junior high-school graduate should know 
something about the leading daily newspaper of his commu- 
nity. What is its partisan attitude? If it professes to be 
“independent” in politics, to what extent is it really so? If 
the city is not a large one, to what extent is it a real “news” 
paper, or to what extent merely a purveyor of trivial local gos- 
sip? Does it take a wholesome, progressive attitude on local 
problems? 
b. If the pupil does not live in a large city, he should have similar 
knowledge about one or several metropolitan dailies that are 
widely circulated in his community.
-P-A-G-E-67
ee ee en ee 
USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 53 
c. As a dominant agency in any type of newspaper, local or 
metropolitan, pupils early in their high-school work should get 
to know something about the relative merits and defects of 
the great news-gathering and news-supplying agencies, such 
as the Associated Press, the United Press, and the Interna- 
tional News Service. He should learn, by induction, the reli- 
ability or unreliability, the impartiality and the bias, that is 
apparent upon a little reflection. 
d. He should know the methods and circumstances of news- 
gathering and writing, and of newspaper-making, that will 
help him understand to some extent the reasons for much of 
the unreliability and bias in the news columns. 
e. Beginning in the upper elementary grades the pupil should also 
be inducted into some insight into the relative value of the 
newspaper as compared with the weekly and monthly news 
periodicals, or the magazines that give summaries of, and 
comments on, current events. 
f. A little later he should begin to understand the different 
political and economic points of view of the leading periodicals 
of this type. 
g. He does begin in upper elementary years to develop magazine 
preferences in the non-news class, and here there is imperative 
need for considerable wise guidance. With the meritorious, 
useful types he should get enough directed contacts to develop 
proper evaluations. Acquaintance with certain types will 
serve to broaden his interests in nature, the sciences, mechan- 
ics, inventions, geography, civics, and similar fields. 
h. To others he should later be exposed to bring about some 
inclination toward the more worthy types of recreational 
literature. The negative side, the leading away from the 
“trashy” type, can perhaps best be brought about by building 
up tastes for the superior kinds of fiction and information. 
Assignment: Develop any one of the above sections by concrete 
illustrations. 
38. Assignments of collateral reading 
Methods of assignment. Collateral reading assignments 
may be made in several different ways, one being more in 
line with a particular purpose than another. 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
    54 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
a. Individual assignments of particular selections made by the 
teacher are more common in the grade work or early high- 
school years. Such assignments usually have in mind a report 
back to the class for the purpose of supplementing the text- 
book, for group discussion or comparison, and for training of 
the pupil in expression. 
b. Alternative assignments from a more extended list of references, 
as made by the teacher, found in the textbook, or taken from 
general lists of references, may serve the above purposes and 
also be intended to give the pupil some exercise in evaluation 
and a broader exposure of interests. 
c. A third form is left entirely to the pupil’s initiative. No 
references are given, but the most available material is made 
easily accessible in the classroom itself or on a special reserve 
shelf in the library. This form may not produce such effective, 
systematic results, as far as class work is concerned, but it will 
serve the purpose of bringing the pupils into more interest- 
ing contacts. 
d. The bibliographical search is an extension of the preceding 
form. The material is left in its proper place on the library 
shelves, and the pupil must make his own selections from 
reference lists, Readers’ Guide, and similar aids. This has the 
same advantage and disadvantage as the preceding type of 
work, and gives in addition the occasion for practice in 
bibliographical technique. 
These four types of assignment have been arranged in 
order of increasing difficulty for the pupil. 
Length of assignments. Another question that should be 
raised in connection with collateral assignments is, “What 
is a reasonable amount of outside reading to be expected 
from pupils in any one class, and at different levels?” This 
is to some extent an individual matter, and to some extent 
it is governed by the nature of the course. Some general 
principles for working out a fair average, however, can be 
given. 
The history teacher or the English literature teacher have 
no right to assume that, because the collateral method has
-P-A-G-E-69
  
  USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 55 
been more fully developed in their courses than in some 
other school work, they have a right to claim more than a 
proportionate share of the pupil’s study and reading time in 
and out of school. The student’s total day for school and 
home study may be fairly estimated at eight hours, perhaps 
somewhat less in the grades and somewhat more in the ad- 
vanced high-school classes. This total time should be 
equally divided in an estimate for the four or five “solids” 
the pupil carries. Suppose this gives two hours per sub- 
ject. If we deduct from this the length of the class period, 
we get a reasonable average of what time is left for prepara- 
tion in the textbook or by any other method including col- 
lateral. 
Another principle will help to reduce this to the number of 
pages that may be assigned. A few simple reading tests, 
given in a class period early in the semester to determine the 
number of pages a pupil can read in his textbooks in five 
minutes, will give some valuable results. In making such a 
test give the assignment to “read rapidly, as you would a 
novel”; make the timing accurate, and get a report from 
each pupil as to the exact amount he read. On the basis of 
such a test the class may be divided into three or more 
groups, according to their rate of reading. The amount of 
individual collateral assignments may be governed roughly 
according to such a classification. Let us suppose you have 
a group that reads three pages in five minutes. If your pre- 
vious estimate makes thirty minutes a day seem your fair 
share of the pupil’s time, outside of textbook preparation, 
you have a right to assign fifteen to twenty pages a day in 
your subject to such a group. If the collateral material is 
kept in a library it will probably be more economical to 
make such assignments only a few times a week, so that a 
whole study period may be devoted to it at one time. Esti- 
mates such as this will give the teacher in any subject the  
-P-A-G-E-70
  
  56 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
feeling that she has a right to assign about fifty pages of 
reading per week in the upper grades, seventy-five pages in 
the lower high-school years, and a hundred pages or more in 
the advanced high-school classes. ‘These are conservative 
averages, but they are averages. A few pupils will be found 
who should do twice as much; others will be burdened with 
half such an assignment. 
4. Methods for getting an accounting on collateral reading 
In getting pupils to account for their collateral reading, 
we must recall that such reading may in general serve either 
a direct, or one of several indirect purposes. The direct pur- 
pose is to enrich the minimal requirements of the textbook. 
Material gathered for this purpose should be brought to the 
attention of the whole class by the individual students, 
unless all are doing the same reading. Collateral reading 
assigned for other purposes is usually intended to give the 
individual pupils certain training experiences, and such 
reading has served its purpose when the reading has been 
done. In the former case the pupil’s fidelity to the assign- 
ment is tested in his report to the class; in the latter case 
some of his results may be brought before the class, while 
others will have to be accounted for individually. A variety 
of methods has been used to check up on the collateral work 
in either case, the more important of which will be described 
here. 
Oral report to the class. The most common form is the 
oral report to the class. The reading and report, though, 
are often good for the reporter only. In the section dealing 
with the “expressional” motive it was pointed out that there 
are common faults which the teacher in any subject, no less 
than the English teacher, must try to prevent. Reading 
extracts, or lengthy quotations in adult terminology, are of 
little value to either the class or the reporter. An intelligent
-P-A-G-E-71
USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 57 
understanding of the reference read, a ready recall of its 
general drift, and a clear, simple outline should be insisted 
on. To make such training most effective, and to get a 
worth-while contribution, the pupils should gradually be 
urged to the point where they will need no notes. A simple 
outline of the speaker’s main points may be helpful to the 
class, but this should be put on the blackboard to make the 
use of note slips unnecessary for the speaker. The tempta- 
tion to expand such notes, especially in microscopic writing, 
will hamper the report and fail to develop the valuable 
expression-training that should be prominent in the teach- 
er’s aim. 
A word should be added about the outlines. Much of the 
outlining values are lost, and the chief motive of such work, 
viz., the acquiring of a habit of planning expression, oral or 
written, is often defeated by carrying the outlining work to 
too great a degree of complexity. A simple outline of three 
or four topics, with no subdivisions, if it is followed, is more 
valuable in developing clearness, unity, and coherence than 
an elaborate brief with several degrees of subordination that 
is worked up as an exercise for its own sake, and then laid 
aside or disregarded in the actual composition. 
Handing in outlines or notebooks. This method of re- 
porting on reading done has become almost a tradition. It 
has no value as a contribution to the class unless all are doing 
the same reading. It has its value as a method of checking 
up all pupils on their collateral work, but it has the disad- 
vantage of involving a great deal of laborious work for both 
pupil and teacher. It may, on the other hand, have some 
value in training the pupil in outlining. A limited amount 
of this type of work is probably advisable. Experimenta- 
tion has shown that outlining may become so mechanical an 
exercise that the pupil will retain very little of what he has 
read, even less than he would get if he merely skimmed over
-P-A-G-E-72
  58 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
the passage several times with a conscious intention of get~ 
ting the gist of it. Three or four times as much reading could 
be done, and the material would have more lasting values. 
There are several modifications of this method, some of 
which are intended to prevent the mechanical, unthinking 
form of this activity. Pupils may be asked to combine or 
reorganize, in an original outline, several parallel or comple- 
mentary references. They may be asked to hand in original 
criticism, or reactions to collateral reading, but this is usu- 
ally too difficult to be satisfactory for any but the best high- 
school students. 
Handing in honor slips. If the purpose of collateral read- 
ing has been served when the reading is done, this method is 
sometimes resorted to to eliminate the necessity of the labo- 
rious compilation of notebooks and the equally tiresome task 
of reading them. This method may be justified as a neces- 
sary expedient in very large university classes, where a ma- 
ture sense of responsibility will get most students to do the 
work without being held to account for it. The immature 
grade-pupil and high-school pupil should not be exposed to 
this temptation to shirk his work. 
Oral or written class tests, or quizzes. These can be used 
conveniently only for common assignments, or for readings 
that are very closely related to a common outline. The oral 
quiz has the advantage of bringing all contributions before 
the class, but the disadvantages of wastefulness similar to 
those pointed out for textbook “recitation-testing.” The 
written test is more thorough and efficient, but will deprive 
the class of any possible individual contributions. 
If such tests are given, they probably should be worked 
out in the economical, objective forms to be suggested in the 
chapter on Tests and Examinations (Chapter XI). 
Individual reports or quizzes. If the purpose of the col- 
lateral reading does not include the thought of bringing the
-P-A-G-E-73
  USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 59 
results to the attention of the class, pupils may be asked to 
account for such reading individually, during a regular con- 
ference period or after school. Usually such testing may be 
done very briefly, if it is merely intended to establish the 
fact of the reading having been done. If it was intended to 
accomplish some indirect purpose, the questions may easily 
be adjusted to determine whether the end has been attained. 
The teacher will gradually accumulate a series of efficient 
questions for each piece of collateral assigned. 
For example, if it is merely intended to establish the fact 
that the pupil has read Treasure Island, such questions as, 
“Did John Silver get any of the treasure?” or, “Did he get 
back to England?” would be sufficient. If the purpose has 
been to develop an appreciation of the best, such a question 
as, ““Why did you like the book?” will get a sufficient re- 
sponse to establish the fact of the reading and give a basis for 
a few sentences of suggestive contrast with inferior material. 
Such brief, effective individual quizzes will do much to es- 
tablish an attitude in the pupils that their reading is for 
the reading’s sake, and not for the purpose of testing and 
marking. 
5. Other phases of collateral reading work 
Textbook vs. collateral reading. In summary, it may not 
be out of place here to consider the relative merits of text- 
book study and collateral reading. The former has the ad- 
vantages of economy of time, compactness, organization, 
and of dealing with fundamentals. The collateral reading, 
aside from its direct values of expanding and completing the 
textbook along its own lines, has the further values of giving 
pupils necessary training in a variety of attitudes, skills, and 
habits which must serve the adult vitally in his mature read- 
ing —a training which has been shown to be absolutely es- 
sential to efficient social living.
-P-A-G-E-74
    60 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
It must not be overlooked, though, that collateral reading 
is collateral, and that the core of any course, the best point 
of departure for such reading, should be the textbook. The 
perspective given by the textbook is indispensable to the 
most effective kind of collateral reading. 
The teacher and curriculum-making. Curriculum-re- 
construction is one of the most important phases of the 
reorganization of public school education now taking place. 
Values and objectives are being applied to every topic in 
every school subject. The application of the criterion of so- 
cial need is causing large eliminations, substitutions, and 
additions to be made from and to the various school sub- 
jects. There is good reason to think that this work has only 
as yet really begun. 
Most of this reconstruction of the curriculum seems to be 
carried on by the progressive superintendents and princi- 
pals, or as a result of research work on the part of university 
professors of education and their graduate students. The 
textbook makers are adopting a few of the results of such 
research. In some cities teachers are collaborating in the 
systematic revision of the course of study, working through 
codperating committees. 
Every teacher, though, has an easy opportunity, in the 
daily work in her classroom, to take the initiative in the 
matter of curriculum-reconstruction. She need not wait for 
the formulation of an elaborate and complete revision. The 
work of curriculum-making and of curriculum-adjustment 
is hers every day. Seizing on important current events, 
local needs, and individual tastes, one half or more of het 
daily contribution to the pupils’ development will be suck 
as is not included in the regular course of study or in the 
prescribed textbooks. ‘The collateral reading method just 
described is the most effective of several that she can em: 
ploy for this process of adjustment and enrichment of the 
school curriculum.
-P-A-G-E-75
USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 61 
The teacher who is anxious to improve, who is wide-awake 
and interested, and who feels herself successful in her school 
work, should recognize that prescribed courses of study have 
been prepared with average teachers and average classes in 
mind. Even an average teacher, though, should be able to 
do more than the prescribed work with some of her pupils. 
The superior teacher should be able to do more with most of 
her pupils. It is criminal to drag a whole class over a whole 
semester’s work a second time, in some subject, when it has 
been efficiently covered and satisfactorily mastered — just 
because the course of study sets some average limit for the 
semester’s work in a textbook. Marking time by such repe- 
tition will go far to kill interests that have been aroused when 
the material was fresh. Better employ the time by fresh 
irrelevancies, if there is danger of anticipating or taking the 
edge off the next semester’s work. A wise acquaintance and 
use of suitable collateral materials will make either of such 
alternatives unnecessary. 
Collateral reading for the superior child. One of the most 
important problems the classroom teacher of to-day faces is 
the redemption of geniuses — the rescue of the superior 
child from the boredom and loafing which has engulfed him 
because he has never been challenged to his best by limited 
tasks, suitable to the average child, that are usually set be- 
fore him. The discovery of children of such abilities is now 
made so easy, by the use of a group intelligence test, that a 
teacher hardly seems justified in waiting for administrative 
initiative or the development of a research department in a 
school system to discover and deal with such children. 
When a child of exceptional mental superiority is discov- 
ered there are two common methods of dealing with him. 
One is rapid promotion at the rate, and to the level, where 
he must work. This often involves administrative difficul- 
ties and social objections, if repeated too often. The other 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
62 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
solution is the enriched curriculum. This involves none of 
the difficulties and objections of the other method, and opens 
a field of responsibility which each teacher should assume as 
her own. Collateral reading is the easiest and best solution 
of enriching the course of study for individual pupils. 
Perhaps a single caution with reference to such work is all 
that is necessary. Such extra work must not be loaded on 
too palpably as added tasks that must be accounted for. It 
can be given in all the forms of collateral reading that have 
been enumerated in this chapter, and it should be motivated 
by all the various purposes that have been described. It 
may even be extended to include worth-while reading not at 
all directly connected with the subject in hand, if it serves 
the purpose of exposure to worthy interests. 
The teacher’s collateral reading. Stagnation in teaching 
follows as soon as the teacher ceases to extend her knowledge 
of the subject-matter she is teaching. The daily task soon 
becomes mere routine to the teacher and uninteresting to the 
pupils. The teacher’s knowledge of subject-matter is usu- 
ally woefully inadequate at the beginning of her professional 
career, with the exception of those who take up departmental 
work in a subject that has been a specialty in their univer- 
sity course. Such a teacher may get along successfully for a 
few years on the accumulated reserve, but even for such the 
failure to make efforts for growth is hardly excusable. Con- 
tinued progress in mastery of the subject is necessary, not to 
keep ahead of a class, but to maintain her own interest in it, 
even though the need may not be imperative for classroom 
information purposes. 
There is no excuse for the teacher who is willing to rely on 
adult superiority in the mastery of the child’s textbook for 
her complete teaching stock. A definite, progressive plan of 
collateral reading in one or all of the subjects she is teaching 
should be one of the first duties of a teacher ambitious to im- 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  
USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 68 
prove and advance. It is not a question of professional read- 
ing here — of contacts with educational literature. In this 
context we are speaking only of subject-matter reading. 
The teacher’s program in collateral reading will be much 
the same as that which has been marked out for the pupil. 
Immediate acquaintance with two or three parallel text- 
books, with probably daily or weekly comparisons for her 
own information, as well as for the guidance of pupils in 
their collateral work, would be a good first step. The next 
step would be the compiling and consultation of references to 
further reading, given in the textbooks, again with the same 
double purpose. Next should follow some extensive reading 
in authoritative advanced accounts that cover the whole 
field. Further development will require some work in the 
bibliography of the subject, and the teacher will then be pre- 
pared to choose and follow up more intensive studies of 
selected topics. 
Much of this material must be selected for such complete 
mastery that it can be called into service on the spur of 
the moment for effective, interesting telling to the pupils. 
Nothing will so impress the pupil with his teacher’s ability, 
or give him a lively interest in the subject, as this spontane- 
ous drawing on rich treasures of reserve. 
The teacher’s personal collateral collection. The teacher 
of any subject should accumulate a small library of such 
books and pamphlets in her subjects as will be most usable 
for herself and the pupils. This does not mean the accumu- 
lation of a large private library, such as might be involved in 
the course of personal reading that has just been outlined 
for the teacher. Even college specialists no longer find it 
necessary to accumulate such collections. Their university 
libraries supply their needs far beyond what their own means 
could afford, and comply with their individual requests for 
further material. The teacher in the public schools in any
-P-A-G-E-78
  64 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
progressive community can secure the same kind of service, 
adequate for her own and her class needs, in the school and 
city or county libraries. If she has not had such service 
from the library of her community, it is more likely that she 
has not asked for it than that the request has been refused. 
Professional librarians over the country have developed 
ideals of public service beyond the realization of most of us, 
and as a matter of professional pride they are assuming an 
attitude of codperation it would pay the teacher to test and 
avail herself of. 
For a certain limited type of collateral material, though, 
the teacher should start a collection of subject-matter books 
and pamphlets that may be confined to a desk library. 
These may include a few parallel textbooks, a few of the 
most convenient extensive elaborations of a type readable 
for the pupils of her grade, and a set of general reference 
books or encyclopedias suitable for the type of children in 
her room. In such subjects as geography and history and 
science, many excellent illustrated pamphlets and booklets, 
issued by corporations, railroads, and chambers of commerce, 
may be had for the asking. Encyclopedias should be fur- 
nished by the school for each of the upper grade rooms, or 
several sets, preferably different sets, should be easily acces- 
sible for all the pupils in the school. 
AssicNMENT: Assume that you are the teacher of a specific 
grade; make out a list of fifteen or twenty books you think 
should be in your room, including textbooks, extended manuals, 
and general reference books. Particularize your list for the 
different subjects taught in that grade. 
AssiGNMENT: Examine, in the school or public library, or by 
getting prospectuses from the publishers, three or four 
children’s encyclopedias. Write out a comparison of some of 
their merits and defects. Which would you prefer to own? 
and why? 
The school library. The limitations of the teacher’s

USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 65 
‘means, and the more immediate and constant needs of in- 
‘struction will naturally call for the supplementing of the 
teacher’s desk-collection by the school library. Outside of 
rural schools, which in many States have a special library 
fund for yearly purchases, the development of a school li- 
brary is usually a question for teacher initiative and codpera- 
tion. A school library is neither likely to have a beginning 
nor a constant growth unless teachers ask, and keep on ask- 
ing, for the books they need for collateral purposes. Such a 
library may be started on the initiative of a progressive prin- 
cipal, but, unless the need is felt by the teachers, such a li- 
brary is not likely to be used or to grow gradually and sys- 
tematically, as it should. 
If such a library exists when you come into a school as a 
new teacher, one of your earliest duties should be to make a 
careful examination of it, especially of the sections for gen- 
eral references, and for those subjects you are to teach. 
Another duty to your school is to see that the library is de- 
veloped along the school lines that you are particularly re- 
sponsible for. This is not a question of selfish aggrandize- 
ment of your interests. The principal or superintendent 
will make it his duty to see that all requests are given rela- 
tive consideration, but to expect them to take the initiative 
for your interests is unreasonable, and is not likely to be ef- 
fective. The principal can hardly be expected to help those 
who will not help themselves. Codperative, concentrated 
pressure by all teachers may be warranted if the adminis- 
trators or board have no item in the budget for library pur- 
poses, or if they are inclined to underestimate the importance 
of this item. Spasmodic, over-modest requests in the past 
are probably the reason for such a policy; and the best way 
to overcome it is by persistent, reasonable, requests for such 
teaching aids. If your situation is not what it should be in 
this respect, a few interested teachers can easily get data

from schools more progressive in this matter that will soon 
make its appeal to the pride of local authority. 
Use of the public library. The use of public libraries 
should be developed far more than it is in most communities. 
The readiness of librarians to codperate with the schools has 
already been referred to. We may here raise the questions 
as to why and how the public library, if it is at all accessible, 
should be used. A few brief, specific suggestions may be 
sufficient. 
a. Know what the public library has that can be of use to you and 
your pupils. 
b. Find out what special privileges you and your pupils can get 
in the way of number of books that may be taken out, if for 
school use. 
c. If the library is very accessible to your pupils, ask for special 
reserve shelves for reasonable periods. 
d. Reciprocate by impressing on your pupils the duty of cour- 
tesy and good behavior in the library. 
e. Find out how far the librarian can or will go in getting books 
you suggest. 
f. Plan library trips with your class, if this is at all feasible. 
g. If it is not already the practice, try to get the librarian to per- 
mit pupils to have access to the stacks. 
h. Plan assignments that will give the pupils experiences in find- 
ing things for themselves in the library. A knowledge of 
books gained by independent use of the library should be a 
part of every child’s education, even by the time he graduates 
from the eighth grade. 
i. Help the pupils to understand the use of the book or card cat- 
alogues. Ask the librarian’s codperation in this. 
j. Help the pupils to get a general understanding of the prin- 
ciples on which the library books are arranged in the stacks, 
especially if this is done in the standardized way. Library 
technique has developed to a stage where this ‘‘if’’ is hardly 
necessary. This will help pupils to feel at home in any other 
library they may have access to. 
k. The prime purpose is to teach pupils to become independent 
and efficient in their use of a library; to realize the possibilities
-P-A-G-E-81
  USING COLLATERAL MATERIALS 67 
of its usefulness to them in their school work and in later life; 
and most of all to expose the pupils to a variety of possible 
interest-contacts. In short, it is the culmination of all the 
purposes we are aiming at in our use of the method of collat- 
eral reading.

Herbart’s influence on methods of teaching. About one 
hundred years ago there was developed, in Germany, a gen- 
eral method of teaching technique that has dominated teach- 
ing more extensively than any other form of instruction. 
This was the “inductive development” method of Herbart. 
Its only near rivals in actual school practice are the kinder- 
garten technique of Froebel, and the “‘ object-lesson-observa- 
tion” method of Pestalozzi. 
We are not concerned here with the historical develop- 
ment of Herbart’s method. For practical purposes we may 
illustrate its influence by saying that during the last genera- 
tion it was practically the dominating principle in theory 
and practice in most of the normal schools of this country, 
and it is only during the last few years that recent evolutions 
in method have risen to challenge it. It is probably no ex- 
aggeration to say that a majority of the teachers and teacher- 
trainers of this country, as loyal Herbartians, are trying to 
resist such innovations as supervised study, the project 
method, and other methods, as worthless and temporary
-P-A-G-E-85
  INDUCTIVE-DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUE wel 
“fads.” Not that they are doing this as loyal disciples of 
Herbart, but rather as believers in an Americanized form of 
his technique as introduced by several Americans who are 
still prominent in the field of education. One may go into 
almost any normal school, even the most progressive in the 
country, ask to see some of the student-teachers’ lesson 
plans, and find them so nearly conforming to the Herbartian 
formula that the directness and the extent of the influence 
will be recognized unmistakably. 
In fact, this definite formal planning of lessons is one of 
the characteristic Herbartian ideas. The other is that 
this plan must work up through induction to deduction. 
In both these respects the influence has been a wholesome 
one onthe development of teaching technique. Asa planned, 
well-thought-out process, instruction is bound to be effec- 
tive. Proceeding logically in such a process is open to little 
objection, if the learning is a matter of logic. It is just here 
that we find the Herbartian plan has become subject to fair 
criticism. As a formal method it came to be applied to all 
sorts of materials, even where inductive-deductive logic had 
no chance to function. Formal devotees of the method have 
gone so far as to identify this one method of a possible vari- 
ety as “the method,” in fact as abstract “method,” which 
amounts to taking for granted that if teaching is not for- 
mally Herbartian it is unmethodical or methodless. Text- 
books in educational technique are in wide current use where 
this assumption is unconsciously made by the author in the 
discussion of all other methods, they being regarded not as 
distinctive alternatives but as mere helping devices to the 
formal, logical steps of Herbartian induction. 
The nature of induction. Logic may be defined as a for- 
mal, scientific description of the laws or principles of think- 
ing. One of the most common and most useful ways of 
thinking that logicians have formally isolated and described 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
    72 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
is induction. Another is deduction. Recent writers have 
tended to treat these as a unified, complementary series of 
mental activities which are rarely isolated in practical every- 
day problem solving. But as academic exercises, as a school 
method, it is possible to so manipulate materials of learning 
that now one, then the other, shall have such prominence 
that each may be practiced as a valuable tool of the thinking 
technique. 
In induction, or rather in inductive instruction, the mind 
is confronted with a series of distinct, but related, details or 
particulars, that force one to a general conclusion, a defini- 
tion, a rule, a principle, or aformula. In deductive thinking 
or instruction one takes a rule or formula that has been ‘so 
developed, or that is taken on authority, and applies it to a 
series of particular facts or problems. This results in an in- 
terpretation or solution useful in practical life. 
In practical everyday affairs these reciprocal logical pro- 
cesses go on unconsciously, as we are confronted with new 
experiences, but the genesis of new ideas, the mastery of 
complicated laws and principles, may be developed by a 
formal application of the natural logical steps involved. 
By wise selection and presentation of details, the teacher 
may set before learning minds such material as will make 
possible the comprehension of generalizations that have 
been evolved through many years, or even centuries of hu- 
manexperience. Instruction is thus provided with a method 
that makes thorough and efficient learning possible. The 
learner grasps ideas which pioneers gave a lifetime to dis- 
cover. Thus the passing on of our social heritage from one 
generation to another is made, economically and effectively. 
Explanation of the “inductive-development” method. 
Herbart’s great contribution to teaching as an art was that 
he recognized the value of using the steps in such a logical 
process of thinking as an advisable plan in learning. By
-P-A-G-E-87
  INDUCTIVE-DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUE = 73 
careful thought about the circumstances of the learning 
process, he determined that instruction planned for this 
purpose could best be carried out by having the learner pro- 
ceed, step by step, through a series of four, definite, formal 
phases. These four were further developed by two of his 
pupils and followers, Ziller and Rein, into five distinctive 
steps, with a clear subdivision of two phases for the first 
step. Revisions, in the interest of clearness and simplicity, 
were also made in the terms used for these steps, so that we 
now have what are known as the Five Formal Steps of the 
inductive-development method of teaching or lesson-plan- 
ning. These “five formal steps” are: 
1. Preparation. 
(a) Statement of the aim. 
(b) Providing an apperceptive basis. 
2. Presentation. 
8. Comparison. 
4. Generalization. 
5. Application. 
Each of these may be briefly described and illustrated. 
1. The Five Formal Steps 
Preparation. This includes two distinct subdivisions, 
which may best be discussed separately. 
(a) Statement of the aim. 'This is intended to give pupils a 
clear idea of the trend of the lesson, but it is probably more 
profitable as a conscious declaration by the teacher to her- 
self as to the specific motive she has in mind. Several con- 
ventional refinements are in use in various normal schools. 
Some require practice teachers to state, on each lesson plan, 
the “general aim” and the “specific aim.”” The two are in- 
tended to show clearly the relationship of the particular les- 
son to a larger unit of subject-matter. Frequently this dis- 
tinction becomes a mere formalism, as the general aim is
-P-A-G-E-88
  74 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
stated in such comprehensive form that it may be left as a 
standing declaration for a whole semester’s work. An incor- 
rect and a correct statement of aims in language work will 
illustrate the useless and the useful types. 
Incorrect: General aim — To teach the child to write and speak 
correctly. 
Specific aim — To teach the correct use of lay and lie. 
CorrEct: General aim — To help pupils overcome the most com- 
mon errors. 
Specific aim — To teach the correct use of lay and lie. 
A second common variant in the statement of the aim is to 
state first the “‘teacher’s aim,” and then the “pupil’s aim.” 
In the above lesson the teacher’s aim might be stated as 
either the general or the specific aim, as given above. The 
pupil’s aim would be stated as, “To learn when to use lay 
and when to use lie.” 
At this point we should note the distinctive purposes for 
which the inductive development lesson can and should be 
used. For a common misunderstanding of the inductive 
lesson results in formal planning, and in the use of the same 
plan outline, even though material or the teacher’s aim is 
not at all suited to the kind of exercises involved in the suc- 
ceeding steps. This may be explained and illustrated by 
the concrete material used above. 
The correct use of lay and lie and the other parts of these 
verbs can be learned in two ways — by drill, or by a clear 
understanding and application of the grammatical facts and 
rules involved. The very nature of induction demands that 
the child shall be brought into contact with a sufficient num- 
ber of concrete or particular elements that will practically 
compel him to discover the definition, rule, or principle in- 
volved, or that will help him to understand clearly the rules 
that lie back of particular usages — in this case the gram- 
matical usages in speaking and writing.
-P-A-G-E-89
  INDUCTIVE-DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUE 78 
The correct use of Jay and lie and their forms may be 
learned by drill on the correct forms, without a knowledge or 
understanding of the rules involved. This is done by imi- 
tation and repetition until the use of the correct forms be- 
comes a habit. This is the way in which we all learned prac- 
tically all the correct and incorrect forms we use in conversa- 
tion or writing. Experimental studies ! have shown that a 
few of the incorrect forms are so common and persistent that 
most children have acquired the wrong form as fixed habits. 
One of the most difficult phases of school work is the cor- 
rection of these wrong language habits. We have now come 
to believe quite generally that the best way to overcome 
such wrong habits is to drill on the correct forms until they 
_ become automatic and supplant the others. 
Not so many years ago it was the common conviction 
among teachers that such errors would be supplanted if the 
child learned the rules that governed their correct usage. 
This conviction dominated school practice, and resulted in 
a careful and persistent study of formal grammar. The 
practice became a tradition that was taken for granted, and 
still holds a large place in school language work, although 
experimental studies have shown that many children and 
adults can and do use correct English without knowing the 
grammatical rules involved, while others may know the 
rules and understand them without having such formal 
knowledge control their expression. 
Now it is probably true that, at a certain stage in the 
child’s development, imitation becomes rational, as social 
psychologists have pointed out. At such a stage a rule or a 
reason for or against a practice will serve as a controller or 
governor of conduct. Also there are stages in a child’s learn- 
ing when he demands reasonable authority for the teacher’s 
1 Several such studies are summarized in the Sixteenth Yearbook, National 
Society for the Study of Education, part 1, pages 85-110.
-P-A-G-E-90
  
  16 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
insistence that his common experience is an experience that 
has no sanction in the best usage. 
In this connection it is immaterial how much value as a 
conduct control we are willing to grant lies in a knowledge or 
understanding of rules, as in grammar. We may concede 
such knowledge considerable influence. It is only, though, 
when we are trying to teach children knowledge or under- 
standing of a rule, definition, principle, or formula that the 
inductive development plan of instruction is suitable. Still 
more, when we are teaching such generalizations, at least 
for the first time, it is probably the most suitable and most 
effective method of instruction we can select. In a drill 
lesson on a specific practice, however, or in an apprecia- 
tion lesson, or in reports on collateral reading, or in some 
of the other types of general method, the steps of an induc- 
tive development plan will probably have no place at all. 
The use of such a plan would be highly formal and artifi- 
cial, and might interfere with the most effective kind of 
learning. 
In short, we should not use the inductive development 
steps unless we are actually dealing with an inductive pro- 
cess, proceeding to the learning of a generalization from par- 
ticulars; and we should probably use this method whenever 
we are trying to teach the meaning and significance of any 
generalization. 
— With this in mind, then, we may restate our specific 
aim, saying that the teacher intends “the children shall 
learn why, or the rules by which, they may know when it 
is correct to use the various principal parts of lay and 
of lie.” 
(b) Providing the apperceptive basis. If this clearly is the 
aim of the lesson, the next problem the teacher must work 
out is, “ What knowledge or experiences have the children of 
the class had that are absolutely necessary, or that will help
-P-A-G-E-91
    
INDUCTIVE-DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUE U7 
them, to understand and master this new rule or set of rules 
I am going to teach them?” Herbartians call this phase of 
the preparation step building-up or providing the proper 
“ apperceptive basis,” or“‘apperceptions’ mass.” This step 
insures a thoughtful grading or sequence of materials. the 
child learns. These ideas of proper sequence, and of the im- 
portance of apperception, were other prominent elements in 
Herbart’s educational theory, as well as the effectiveness of 
inductive teaching. 
Let us illustrate again. In the model plan, what would be 
some of the necessary bases for effective learning of the gen- 
eral principles involved in the correct use of the forms of lay 
and lie? 
(1) The fact of irregular verbs. 
(2) The difference between transitive and intransitive verbs. 
(3) What parts of the verb are called the “principal parts”? 
(4) The difference between past tense and past participle. 
(5) The fact that the past participle is used with certain auxiliary 
verbs, such as have and had, or any of their compounds. 
(6) A drill lesson on the principal parts of lay and lie is presup- 
osed. 
(1) A clear understanding of the difference in meaning between 
the two verbs, which is partly involved in the distinction be- 
tween transitive and intransitive. 
AssIGNMENT: These are absolutely essential elements in the ap- 
perceptive basis; can you suggest other items that would help 
in a better understanding? 
** This second phase of the “preparation” is usually an im- 
portant or prominent step in the teaching. Occasionally 
such an apperceptive basis may be taken for granted; usu- 
ally it involves a lively, intense review of such necessary 
related past experiences of the group. Some Herbartians 
suggest that the pupils should be led to recognize the pro- 
blem as a result of such a review; that “the statement of the 
aim” should come “as the culmination of the step of prepa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  78 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
ration”; and that we should “not impose the problems of 
adults upon children.” 
~ Presentation. The class is now ready to have presented 
to it the concrete or particular, new material that involves 
the generalizations that are ultimately to be reached. The 
most important generalizations are: That the past tense of 
lie is the same word as the present tense of lay; that the past 
participle forms of the two verbs are different — lie, lay, 
lain, and lay, laid, laid; that the past tense and past parti- 
ciple of lie are different; and that these two forms of lay are 
the same. 
{ The mere statement of these ultimate generalizations, es- 
pecially when stated in a comparative way, shows the seri- 
ousness of the confusion that is possible. The generaliza- 
tions are given here, not because they are to be introduced 
to the class at this point, but because they must necessarily — 
be in the mind of the teacher in order to select intelligently 
such particulars as shall involve all the data necessary that 
the children may draw proper generalizations.) The gen- 
eralizations are not made until the fourth step of the lesson 
plan is reached, although they must be constantly in the 
mind of the teacher during the third “step,” namely, com- 
parison, and often this comparison is worked out at the same 
time the particulars (second “‘step”’) are “‘presented.” 
In carrying on the model plan that has been assumed thus 
far, it would now be necessary for the teacher to prepare a 
large number of sentences, to be presented to the class, that 
would involve the use of the various forms of lay and lie in 
several of their more common and natural contexts. The 
effectiveness of such sentences would depend on the correct 
usage of the various forms, and this involves a difficulty that 
strikingly illustrates the claim that has been made about 
1 Compare Strayer, A Brief Course in the Teaching Process, pages 53- 
55.
-P-A-G-E-93
  
INDUCTIVE-DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUE 719 
the relative merits of drill and formal knowledge of gram- 
matical rules as controlling correct speech. In presenting 
the particular sentences the pupils either have to accept the 
authority of the teacher for their correctness, or the teacher 
has to assume the children already can do what she is trying 
to help them to know and understand. 
However, for purposes of illustrating the method, it 
will be well to develop the step by a discussion of the ma- 
terial that should be presented. It will be safer to assume 
here that the pupils are still in a state of “original sin” with 
reference to the usage, and that they should be given the 
correct forms on the authority of the teacher. 
AssIGNMENT: Write out fifteen or twenty sentences that you 
would use to present the generalizations involved. Be sure 
there is a great enough variety in the examples to bring in 
most of the more common uses of these verbs. To insure this, 
read the complete sections in a standard dictionary. Avoid 
examples using the verbs in obscure or obsolete usage. Would 
it be advisable to have sentences using such forms as lays, 
lying, laying ? 
The material used in the presentation need not necessa- 
rily be made to order by the teacher. It may be assumed as 
already within the experience of the children, whence it may 
really be drawn by a class discussion. Sometimes it may be 
provided for, if the necessary material is new, by a prelim- 
inary assignment of reading in the textbook or collateral 
work. Again, it may be gathered by a well-directed prelim- 
inary exercise in observation. 
«» Comparison. This third “step” in the inductive plan is 
intended to bring together related elements in such a way 
that the fourth “step” — the generalization — shall pro- 
ceed out of it as a flashing discovery, a natural conviction, a 
forced general conclusion. Like will be brought into contact 
with like, and common features of the several sentences re-
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
cognized. In this particular lesson, for example, a beginning 
of the comparisons might be made by noting that all the 
forms of lay are followed by an object, and that it is a transi- 
tive verb; similarly, that all the forms of lie show it to be an 
intransitive verb. Similar comparisons must prepare for 
each of the generalizations that have been named above. A 
complexity enters into this model series that should usually 
be avoided in planning an inductive development lesson. 
It has been introduced for a double purpose, however, which 
may be explained at this point. 
~ In the first place, the process of comparison will some- 
times involve contrasts, or exclusions — unlikeness which 
will make the likeness more real. There is, perhaps, an em- 
barrassing supply of contrast in this model lesson, but, if the 
particular aim is to be attained, the confusion will have to 
be mastered and the contrasting and comparing will have to 
be emphasized. 
- The second purpose in introducing this complexity was to 
point out the importance of not attempting too much in an 
inductive lesson. Where a particular problem in generaliza- 
tion requires elaborate treatment in the presentation and 
comparison “steps,” the necessity of reducing the induction 
to its simplest terms is apparent. 
It is also necessary here to point out a disadvantage in 
inductive development teaching, which, however, has a com- 
pensating advantage. The inductive lesson is time-consum- 
ing. Probably three or four periods would be necessary to 
develop the plan of the lesson on lay and lie properly, but, if 
the work is well done, the generalization will probably be 
mastered more intelligently and more effectively than it 
could be done by any other method. It is especially supe- 
rior, so far as an understanding of rules and principles is con- 
cerned, to the textbook method, which usually proceeds on 
the deductive plan by giving the rule on authority, with ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
INDUCTIVE-DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUE 81 
ercises to which it is to be applied. The inductive method is 
especially important, therefore, in the elementary phase of 
learning; the deductive is so much more economical that it is 
preferable where maturity makes induction unnecessary for 
a ready understanding of the general rule or definition. 
~ Generalization. In this step the climax to the inductive 
process is reached. Its meaning needs no elaboration here. 
The rule or definition, the formula or principle, has been 
evolved and is stated. 
* Several practices are insisted on as essential in working 
out this step. The most important of these, generally in- 
sisted on by the Herbartians, is that the generalization must, 
by all means, be made and stated by the pupils themselves 
— never by the teacher. If the desired conclusion does not 
force itself on the class, the presentation and comparisons 
have not been efficient and adequate. They must then 
be reviewed and probably elaborated. The generalization 
must be a discovery — never a revelation. The greatest dif- 
ficulty here lies in the range of individual differences in the 
class. A single keen pupil will anticipate the rest of the class 
in the discovery. A common method of guarding against this 
premature exposure is to have all the pupils in the class write 
out the rule or definition they have discovered, thus giving 
them all a chance to make the generalization. 
Another disadvantage met with at this point is the diffi- 
culty experienced by children in expressing the necessary 
abstractness that is often found in a satisfactory generaliza- 
tion. Exactness of expression is also a necessity that is gen- 
erally imperfectly attained. Fairly satisfactory generaliza- 
tions may be accepted, and carefully amended and reworded, 
with proper references to the “presentation” materials to 
show reasons for the corrections. 
~ Application. The fourth “step” has, of course, completed 
the induction. The presence of the fifth “step” makes it 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  82 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
seem more proper to speak of this method as the inductive- 
deductive development lesson, as is often done. The gen~ 
eralization, in its final revised form, is now applied to new 
particulars — sometimes by way of review by application; 
sometimes by way of problem-solving. This depends on the 
nature of the generalization reached. 
To illustrate, in the lesson under discussion, the pupils 
may now be given, as an assignment for the next lesson, a 
number of sentences with blanks in which proper forms of 
lay and lie are to be inserted, with an understanding that 
pupils must be able to give the proper rule or explanation 
for every form used. 
Assignment: Make out an appropriate list of such sentences 
that will involve the necessary variety of forms to involve all 
points that should be stressed. 
2. Principles underlying the inductive-development method 
There are certain fundamental principles in education, es- 
pecially with reference to the psychology of learning and the 
educational aims, which a teacher should clearly keep in 
mind. These may be considered at this point to show the 
special values of the method, and to emphasize further the 
types of material and learning to which induction is spe- 
cially adapted. 
Only a few of the outstanding principles can be introduced 
here. The whole matter has been developed in a very de- 
tailed way in the educational literature of the American fol- 
lowers of Herbart. Among these the most prominent have 
been Frank and Charles McMurry, and Charles De Garmo. 
The McMurrys’ book on The Method of the Recitation is 
probably the classic in this field. 
~» Concepts and percepts. The psychological principle at 
the root of this method, McMurry shows,! is that “concepts 
1 McMurry, Frank, Method of the Recitation, page 11.
-P-A-G-E-97
INDUCTIVE-DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUE 83 
are built up on percepts, general notions from particular.” 
While later psychologists, notably Dewey, have shown that 
in practical everyday life learning is never as clear-cut an 
induction as it is usually made in this method, it must still 
be admitted that teaching may assume that such a con- 
scious, and rather mechanical procedure, does have consid- 
erable value in learning that involves generalizations, con- 
cept-building, or concept-clarifying. 
Selection of particulars. With this principle as a point of 
departure the Herbartians have shown, in an extensive lit- 
erature dealing with various school subjects, such as geog- 
raphy, arithmetic, and reading, as well as in textbooks in 
such subjects, that particulars for teaching should never be 
selected without reference to general concepts to which they 
may be related.! One of the evils in textbook-making and 
textbook-teaching, which the followers of Herbart have done 
much to overcome, was the meaningless cramming of de- 
tached and unrelated facts, especially in the content sub- 
jects, perhaps most notably in geography. Remarkable 
“type studies” are credited to the McMurrys, in this special 
field of geography, which have made it possible for teachers 
and pupils to correlate and combine, in a single principle, 
great masses of detailed information which would have been 
meaningless without such a unifying interpretation. 
A number of such unifying generalizations have become 
valuable permanent principles for the understanding of im- 
portant industrial, economic, and social data. In dealing 
with content subjects the Herbartians have been successful 
in demonstrating their claim that “It would not be difficult 
to show that all the higher studies, as history, science, lan- 
guage, medicine, law, etc., become organized under general 
notions or principles; in fact, the definition of science is ‘gen- 
eralized, classified knowledge.’” ? 
1 Compare McMurry, Frank, Method of the Recitation, page 58 f. 
2 Tbid., page 11,  
-P-A-G-E-98
  84 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Importance of general truths. They have shown, by re- 
sults in the general improvement of teaching technique, 
that “the mastery of the general truths of a study must re- 
main the direct purpose of instruction in each branch of 
knowledge,” ! that it is (a) the mastery of rules and prin- 
ciples, and (b) the ability to apply them, that are, or should 
be, constantly aimed at in all the best school work.” 
Along this line the attention of the progressive teacher 
should be called to an important item in her semester lesson- 
planning, which somewhat anticipates a later chapter on 
that subject.? In making a semester plan of her work in any 
subject the teacher should definitely formulate a list of the 
general truths, principles, or rules that may best be devel- 
oped by the inductive plan. To be successful such lessons 
should all be worked out carefully in advance, with the reg- 
ular outline of the “five formal steps” as a guide. 
3. Advantages of the inductive method 
Teaching the child inductive technique. No type of men- 
tal activity has given the world so many valuable discoveries 
of truth, especially in the realm of science, as has inductive 
reasoning. Such mental activity is perhaps the highest and 
most productive the human mind is capable of. In our 
school work we have ceased to think the most valuable 
thing we can do for the child is stuffing him with informa- 
tion. We have come to think that, even in the purely in- 
formational subjects, much of the material dealt with is not 
intended for permanent retention. It is mere water that 
makes the mill-wheel turn, and then passes on forever use- 
less after it has done its work. 
Much of the informational data in history and geography 
serves the same purposes as the problems and examples in 
1 Compare McMurry, Frank, Method of the Recitation, page 10. 
2 Tbid., page 11. 3 See chapter xu in this text.
-P-A-G-E-99
  INDUCTIVE-DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUE 85 
arithmetic. These are never remembered; they serve their 
function in helping the pupil to use and fix rules and for- 
mule. So, more and more, in all school work, emphasis is 
passing from the learning of information to the acquiring of 
habits, skills, and attitudes developed from the passing con- 
tact or the temporary use of information. Important among 
such aims is the development of a varied mental technique 
— the conscious power of attacking a problem in the most 
economical and efficient way. 
Just here lies one of the chief values and the most impor- 
tant limitation of the inductive-development method. It 
can and should serve to develop conscious control of one of 
the most valuable and productive methods of problem-soly- 
ing. Its possibilities for service, however, are limited to 
that single type of thinking technique, though that one is 
perhaps the most important of all. 
Makes teaching purposeful.. A second advantage of the 
inductive development is that it makes teaching purposeful. 
The teacher must be able to state a clear aim for the pupils, 
either from her own point of view, or the pupils’, or both. 
This definiteness of aim is more easily lost sight of in con- 
nection with some other methods, notably the textbook and 
collateral methods, while the purposefulness is probably still 
more prominent in some of the other methods to be dis- 
cussed later, notably the project method. 
Thoughtful memorization. Generalizations derived by 
this method are much less open to the objection that chil- 
dren will take on authority a meaningless jumble of symbols 
and, by ready repetition, give the impression that what they 
have memorized they have mastered to the point of under- 
standing.

I. Tur Meantne anv Forms or Srupy 
What is meant by “study.” There are various activities 
persons may engage in, in school and out, that we would 
designate as “study.” The International Dictionary gives 
two definitions which imply this variety of activities. — One
-P-A-G-E-103
  SUPERVISED STUDY 89 
reads: “A setting of the mind or thoughts upon a subject; 
hence, application of mind to books, arts, or science, or to 
any subject, for the purpose of acquiring knowledge.” A 
second definition gives, “Mental occupation; absorbed or 
thoughtful attention; meditation; contemplation.” In de- 
fining the verb, “to study,” a distinction similar to the above 
is found in the two relevant definitions given: (1) “To fix the 
mind closely upon a subject; to dwell upon anything in 
thought; to muse; to ponder.” (2) “To apply the mind to 
books or learning.” 
These definitions are given with a purpose of contrasting 
them with an almost universal misconception entertained by 
pupils and teachers alike. To most persons, study means 
getting a lesson, preparing an assignment, learning for the 
purpose of meeting the common artificial school situation of 
being tested in a “recitation.” While this academic activ- 
ity is included in the activities described, it must be appar- 
ent that the common type of school study is only one of a 
variety of mental activities that may be designated as study. 
It must also be apparent that what makes this common type 
of school study artificial is the absence of the real purpose of 
“thought” or “reflection,” which is more or less emphasized 
in the definitions. 
New conceptions as to purpose in studying. In the first 
definition given the purpose is stated as the “acquiring of 
knowledge.” We are now coming to regard the acquisition 
of knowledge as only a partial, and perhaps a less important, 
purpose of study. The acquisition of habits, skills, and atti- 
tudes is now prominently emphasized among educational 
objectives. In the acquisition of some of these, the neces- 
sary knowledge involved is even thought of as incidental, 
and of ephemeral value. 
An analysis of a variety of school and adult activities that 
are designated as study will probably help us to a more ade-
-P-A-G-E-104
  90 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
quate concept of the term. Such an analysis will also make 
us conscious of the fact that pupils may do, and may be as- 
signed to do, very different types of work in school. A clear 
identification and analysis of these various types has been 
one of the most valuable contributions of the supervised 
study movement. Likewise, a conscious use of this variety 
of study-activities will greatly help the teacher in both as- 
signment and supervision, the two most important features of 
supervised study when we think of it as a teaching method. 
1. Reading as a form of study 
The importance of reading. We have already seen that 
the bulk of school work or study consists of reading, prin- 
cipally in textbooks. We have also noted how this reading 
activity may, and should be, extended considerably beyond 
the field of the textbook. 
The whole reading activity in the elementary school has ° 
been revolutionized in the last decade. Emphasis has passed 
from oral to silent reading, and from slow intensive silent 
reading to rapid and more intensive silent reading. The an- 
alysis of the physiological and mental activities involved in 
reading have made possible an adaptation in teaching- 
method in this subject superior to the technique of instruc- 
tion in any other school subject. 
Out of such analyses, especially on the psychological side, 
there has come a most helpful classification of the purposes 
of reading, with a corresponding mind-set which it is possible 
for pupils to assume consciously. This makes possible the 
adjustment by the pupil of his reading activity to serve a 
particular purpose, if he has been consciously trained in this 
variety of reading methods and if the teacher, in any par- 
ticular assignment, takes the pupils into her confidence as to 
the purposes to be attained. 
Rapid silent reading: Skimming. Some reading is under-
-P-A-G-E-105
  
  SUPERVISED STUDY 91 
taken merely for the purpose of getting fundamentals or the 
bare outline of thought. Skimming, hurried intense search 
for just the main divisions, or rapid glancing over page after 
page to glean the bare essentials, or the general trend or 
atmosphere of the selection, best serves this purpose. Such 
reading, introduced into public school work in the last few 
years and spreading rapidly, has to make its way against 
considerable opposition. The old idea that slow, laborious, 
word-by-word reading is the most effective for thought- 
getting is still so widely held, that the advocates of rapid 
reading must sometimes feel they are working against a 
prejudice so universal that they seem to be flying in the face 
of “common sense.” They have, however, the whole trend 
of experimental, scientific studies to support them. Such 
experiments have not fully demonstrated the value of the 
new practice, but they have gone far enough to give us con- 
siderable confidence that one of the essentials in teaching 
reading should be the increase in rate of reading. Such 
studies have shown that there is a high degree of correlation 
between speed and comprehension; more than that, that an 
increase in rate increases comprehension scores generally. 
Enthusiasts may carry the implications too far in actual 
practice. Dr. Burgess wisely warns us ? against presuming 
too much on our correlation data: — 
In reading there is almost always a demand for speed. In the 
early discussions of rates of silent reading, high-school and college 
teachers reported cases of students who, although of excellent 
standing in most of their subjects, were making poor records in 
classes where large amounts of supplementary reading were as- 
signed. It was found that, with these students, the rate of silent 
reading was often so slow that they were genuinely unable to keep

S. A., “Standards in Rates of Reading”; in Fourteenth Yearbook, National 
Society for the Study of Education, part 1 (1915), pages 44-58.

-P-A-G-E-106
  92 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
up with the pace easily set by their classmates. There are students 
who read the ordinary novel at the rate of fifteen pages an hour; and 
there are others, often in the same classroom, who can read the same 
novel at the rate of one hundred and fifty pages an hour. It is, 
moreover, true that, while there are exceptions to the rule, rapid 
readers are usually those who get most out of what they read; in 
general, speed and comprehension increase together. In empha- 
sizing speed, then, we are indirectly emphasizing comprehension; 
and the measure which is of greatest importance to those who are 
teaching reading is that which answers the question, “How much 
can he get, right, how fast?” 
Reading for comprehension. A more advanced purpose 
in reading may be described as simply understanding. Such 
reading involves more thoughtful adjustments than does the 
previous type. The reading activity will vary from skim- 
ming to slow, careful scrutiny of some sentences, or even 
words. Much of the material in school work, especially of 
the narrative and explanatory type, need be read only a 
single time to serve its purpose. The details themselves of 
a story are merely of passing value; they need merely be 
noticed to contribute such values to the plot or character- 
ization as a whole. The same is true of much in an explan- 
atory selection. If we once understand the total idea the 
details have served their purpose. They have no value ex- 
cept in their relationships, and they are not intended for 
permanent retention. This fact is often lost sight of in 
school assignments, and the danger is specially prominent 
when progress is set at such a slow rate that details lose their 
place in a proper perspective, and assume an undue prom- 
inence because their natural context is destroyed. 
When we are reading to understand there are, on the other 
hand, some passages, paragraphs, or sentences that have to 
be read slowly and carefully, either because of their relative 
importance or their relative difficulty. Relative importance 
is inherent in the subject-matter itself. Relative difficulty 
 
-P-A-G-E-107

is an individual matter, depending on the past experiences, 
the mental ability, or the apperceptive basis of each reader. 
Pointing out passages of special intrinsic importance be- 
comes a part of the teacher’s business in making assign- 
ments, at least during that period of a child’s development 
when he is still acquiring the technique of proper study. 
For most pupils this period extends well into high-school 
years. The development of independence in recognizing and 
evaluating such passages as he reads is to be one of the aims 
in teaching, but such independence can be promoted by a 
period of evaluation by the teacher in the making of assign- 
ments, and by calling the pupils’ attention to the necessity 
of such evaluation. Such guidance must not be continued 
too long, but there is less danger of overdoing it than of 
leaving it to be acquired by unguided experience with an 
expectation that necessity will result in the invention of a 
suitable technique of study. 
Reflective reading. A third form of reading that may be 
distinguished is an extension of the foregoing. In reading to 
understand there will occur certain passages which require 
pauses for thoughtful consideration. There is a variety of 
terms to describe the mental processes that may be required 
for complete understanding of difficult, abstract, or ab- 
struse material — reflection, analysis, synthesis, classifica- 
tion, associating experience, concrete imaging, illustration, 
comparison or contrast, definition, and doubt or challenge. 
With the possible exception of analysis or outlining, such 
methods of thoughtful solution or reaction are not suffi- 
ciently or specially encouraged as a phase of study tech- 
nique. The technique of teaching them has, indeed, hardly 
been developed, although the analysis of such a variety of 
study has been developed in connection with the supervised 
study movement. The steps in such processes will be taken 
up in more detail in a later section of this chapter, dealing 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  94 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
with thinking as a form of study, and from another point of 
view in Chapter V in connection with problem-solving. The 
study methods there outlined should also be brought to bear 
on problems arising in connection with reading, and the 
methods of approach to a solution should be developed as 
skills available for any reading difficulty. 
To seek for comparable or related material, and to com- 
pare authorities, is a form of reflective reading. This is the 
method of collateral reading, described in Chapter II, or, 
more distinctively, that phase of collateral study which was 
discussed under the bibliographical purpose. (See pages 
43-45). There is more than the mere reading activity 
involved in this, however. There is the thoughtful search 
itself, and the subsequent reflection, comparison, and organ- 
ization of the materials found. 
Memorizing. A fifth form of reading is for the purpose of 
memorization. This will, of course, involve several or fre- 
quent re-readings, depending on the degree or nature of the 
mental fixing desired. There is the complete and exact ver- 
bal memorization; the fixing of the substance of a passage; 
or, as is more commonly the case in school work, the mastery 
of the substance for a temporary immediate emergency, 
usually the recitation period. Such reading to remember or 
to reproduce, either for temporary or permanent use, should 
be preceded by study for complete understanding. This is 
an apparent necessity, both as a help to economical learning 
and as a preventative against futile verbal memorization. 
In connection with reading to remember we have several 
helpful principles of learning that have been evolved from 
extensive experimentation. These may be conveniently 
stated in the form in which they are given in Whipple’s man- 
ual on How to Study Effectively. 
1. Carry the learning of all important items beyond the point 
necessary for immediate recall.
-P-A-G-E-109
  SUPERVISED STUDY 95 
2. When drill or repetition is necessary, distribute over more than 
one period the time given to a specified learning. 
8. When the material to be learned by heart presents no obvi- 
ous rational associations, it is perfectly legitimate to invent 
some artificial scheme for learning and recalling it. 
4. In committing to memory a poem, declamation, or oration, 
do not break it up into parts but learn it as a whole. 
5. In committing to memory, it is better to read aloud than to 
read silently, and better to read rapidly than to read slowly. 
Reading to locate material for future reference. A sixth 
type of reading is quite like the first in its form, but is quite 
different from it in its purpose. This is skimming, or rapid 
reading, to locate material for future reference, either in the 
field of information or authority. Much of the professional 
man’s reading, both in his university training and in after 
life, takes on this form and serves the double purpose of get- 
ting the “gist” of a book or an article, and of locating a mass 
of such material for future possible use. Sometimes the 
former of these purposes is not so prominent as the latter. 
In this case the perusal will be of the very casual, sampling 
sort. Much of the training and equipment in certain profes- 
sions consists of this knowledge of where and how to find in- 
formation or authority, when needed. This is perhaps most 
characteristically illustrated in the case of lawyers. This 
type of reading is really an extension of what was discussed 
fully as the “bibliographical” purpose, in connection with 
collateral reading in Chapter IT. 
We have now considered six distinctive forms of reading, 
with our analysis based on the various purpose each has. 
These forms of reading taken together constituted only a sin- 
gle phase of “study,” certainly the most common form, and 
perhaps, because it is so universal an activity, the most im- 
portant form of study. There are also other study activities, 
though, both in school and out of it, that ought to be con- 
sidered to make our analysis of study complete.  
-P-A-G-E-110
  96 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Assignment: Is the analysis of the various types and purposes 
of reading complete? Can you suggest any variation that 
might have been included? 
The study of working manuals. Following directions for 
independent operations is a type of study prominent in 
school work in two special lines — in working problems in 
arithmetic and the other mathematical studies, and in labo- 
ratory work in the sciences. Usually such study operations 
involve a small amount of careful reading in the manuals in 
which the problems or directions for work are given, al- 
though this is not an essential characteristic. The problems 
or directions may be given orally. 
Usually such study exercises have the purpose of applying 
rules or principles, or of giving practice for skill in such opera- 
tions. 
As distinctive study activities each of these involves one 
of the general methods in teaching, and they will be discussed 
fully in Chapter IX dealing with “Drill,” and in Chapter 
VII in the discussion of the “Laboratory Method.” 
2. Thinking as a study activity 
Thinking or reflection as a form of study must be distin- 
guished from one of the phases of reading discussed above. 
Thinking as a parallel or complement to certain types of 
reading was there taken up. The highest form of study, 
though, is that in which the thinking process is carried on in- 
dependently, and progressively. This may be done as purely 
mental contemplation, but is more commonly carried on 
with some form of expression — usually writing — to keep a’ 
record of the progress of the thought. The recording is only 
incidental, however; the thinking itself is what we properly 
conceive of as the “study.” 
Fundamental mental processes. The term thinking is 
used here in a very broad sense, and study of this purely 
.
-P-A-G-E-111
  SUPERVISED STUDY 97 
mental type may take on a great variety of activities which 
we can analyze and define in more or less conventional psy- 
chological terminology. Some of these processes progress 
automatically from simpler to more complex forms, but it is 
worth while to isolate and define them for the sake of our 
supervised-study technique. Such analysis will help teach- 
ers plan and direct study activities, and will, if consciously 
trained, improve the pupil’s study technique. 
a. Perception. Perhaps the simplest form is that which is 
usually designated as “perception” in textbooks of psychol- 
ogy. We may accept as a brief definition of perception the 
statement that is commonly given, “sensation with meaning 
attached.” When we consider perception as a phase of 
thinking we may reverse the definition, and say perception 
as a thinking process consists of attaching meaning to any 
sensation. This involves our defining “meaning,” which 
can perhaps be done best by giving synonyms for it, such as 
use, advantage, significance, and value, either immediate or 
remote. In attaching this meaning to a sensation, interest or 
attention is involved. In fact we may perhaps most easily 
define interest as a consciousness that there “is something 
between” ourselves and the object that stimulates our at- 
tention. Unless we recognize such an “interest,” unless we 
are conscious of such a value or meaning in the sensation, we 
are not likely to fix our attention at all. 
b. Apperception. Closely related to perception as a think- 
ing process, but possible of a clear distinction from it, is the 
activity that older psychologists designated as apperception. 
The meaning we put into our sensations, our perceptions, 
has in common the meaning most other persons who have 
the same sensation put into them; but, even in the simplest 
process of this sort that we can isolate, it will probably be 
found that each of those who perceive put something unique 
and individual into the meaning, or estimate its values with
-P-A-G-E-112
  98 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
just a shade of personal bias. This individuality of interpre- 
tation or evaluation may be distinguished as apperception, 
and the differences are due to the fact that each of us has 
a highly individual history of mental experiences. 
Let us suppose I point to a blackboard from which chalk 
marks have been recently and rather imperfectly erased, and 
ask, “What do you see?” If you answer, “White,” or 
“Gray,” or “Black,” you are answering practically in terms 
of pure sensation, and practically every one will agree with 
you. If you answer, “A blackboard,” your answer is in 
terms of perception, i.e., you interpret your sensation in 
terms of “use” or “meaning.” But if you fix your attention 
on an imperfectly erased circle, with a few cross lines barely 
perceptible, and say you see a circle which makes you think 
of an old game of “tick, tack, toe,” which you used to play 
on the blackboard years ago in elementary-school days, your 
unique interpretation would rather be classed as appercep- 
tion, which may not be shared by any one else in the group. 
Probably the moment you suggest such an individual inter- 
pretation you will stimulate every other person to make 
similar personal evaluations. The force of this has often 
been expressed in the common saying that a traveller in for- 
eign lands sees only what he has brought with him. 
c. Conception. A more advanced form of thinking is com- 
monly designated as conception. A concept in its simplest 
form is a generalization involving two or more percepts, 
whether they come simultaneously, successively, or after 
intervals. Such mental reaction involves either the gaining 
of a clearer or more complete understanding of an object, or 
the formation of a class or generic idea resulting from the 
abstraction, or elimination, of accidental or unimportant de- 
tails from individual percepts. Our concept of an orange is a 
combination of sensations or percepts of color, shape, taste, 
texture, and size, and an abstraction of certain limitations
-P-A-G-E-113
    
SUPERVISED STUDY 99 
with reference to all of these qualities. As our perceptions 
are built up by extensive experience we will admit into our 
concept the idea that oranges may be green, that they may 
very irregularly be spherical, and very much smaller than 
we ever see them offered for sale. 
d. Judgments. Continuing along this same general line, 
we pass from concept-building to judgments. When used in 
a restricted sense, we identify as judgment that form of 
thinking which expresses itself in some form of assertion 
that combines two concepts. Often this consists of asserting 
that one concept belongs to, or is the same as, or may be 
classified under, another concept. A judgment has, there- 
fore, often been identified as a “‘sentence,” as we use that 
term in grammar, or as a “proposition,” as that term is used 
in logic. Again, the term judgment is often used in a very 
loose sense as a synonym for any form of thinking. 
e. Reasoning. Similarly, in a restricted sense, the activity 
we term reasoning has been described as the drawing of a 
conclusion from two or more judgments, or passing from one 
judgment to another, and so on to aconclusion. There is a 
variety of classifiable forms of reasoning. A few of these 
may be briefly identified. In inductive reasoning we pass 
from particular judgments or facts to a general conclusion, a 
principle, a law, a rule, a definition, or a formula. In de- 
ductive reasoning we apply any such generalizations to par- 
ticular facts or instances, and arrive at a conclusion or solu- 
tion. Both these forms were fully discussed in the preceding 
chapter. Another common form of reasoning involves the 
relation of cause and effect, and our thinking in this category 
involves either a discovery of the one from the other or an 
understanding of the relationship. 
f. Association. In any of these forms of thinking there is 
usually active the process called association, the connection 
in consciousness of one experience with another or other

experiences so that one tends to recall the other. This con- 
nection is often natural, but it may be forced. Such associ- 
ations may be simultaneous, successive, or may be cumu- 
lative over long intervals of time. Rather definite laws that 
govern such association-processes have been discovered by 
students of the mind.! 
g. Recall. Such associations of past experiences with one 
another or with some new experience involve recall. When 
past experiences are recalled we speak of the process as 
either memory or imagination. Such remembering or imag- 
ing may be either in the form of concrete mental images or 
pictures, or in words or other symbols. Since the image is 
closely associated with the symbol, or involved in it without 
making a mental analysis or substitution necessary for the 
thinking process, it is frequently said that memory and imag- 
ination are alike in that both involve the “recall of past ex- 
periences,”’ and memory is sometimes spoken of as a phase 
of imaging or bringing back a picture of the past before 
the mind’s eye. 
The two are also alike in the fact that they involve a sort 
of double consciousness. In memory we are not alone con- 
scious of images or symbols of a past experience, but we are 
also conscious of the fact that it is a past experience, and we 
usually recall with such an image some of the circumstances 
we associated with it in that past. Ina sense we can identify 
it with a more or less definite past time. In imagination, 
besides the consciousness of the image of the past experience, 
we are also conscious of the fact that the image is present to 
our consciousness only as a mental image. We know the 
thing we are imagining is not a real image, that it is not be- 
ing presented to any of our senses now. We can, therefore, 
without doing violence to any reality, reconstruct or modify 
the image in our mind in any way we please. 
1¥For a good brief discussion of these laws, see Colvin and Bagley, 
Human Behavior, chapter xvt.   
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  SUPERVISED STUDY 101 
Such modifications, in highly imaginative persons, may be 
so great that it would seem as if the mind had really created 
some entirely new image. Because of this it was common at 
one time to call reconstructive imagination creative imag- 
ination. Ifno modification is made in the image, and if there 
is merely the consciousness of unreality, without a definite 
recall of the past circumstances, we call the process repro- 
ductive imagination. Much of our “‘re-citation” of so-called 
memorized material is probably more properly classified as 
this type of recall, on the symbolical plane rather than on 
the plane of concrete imagery. 
Dewey’s method of problem solving. Since Dewey made 
his notable analysis of thinking in his How We Think, it has 
become rather common to speak of any form of thought as 
involving the solution of a problem, or, as he defines it, a 
“question involving doubt or uncertainty.” In attempting 
an application of this idea of thinking to any school problem, 
the teacher may probably get considerable help for her 
method of approach by classifying the kind of thinking that 
is prominently involved in the problem, in one of the con- 
ventional types of mental processes that have just been 
defined. Does the problem involve concept-building or 
clarifying? If so, is there a sufficient number of percepts 
available for the pupil? Or, does the problem involve rea- 
soning? If so, are the necessary judgments or assertions 
available and clear that will normally lead to the necessary 
conclusion? And soon. If pupils are led through a more or 
less mechanical technique for the various phases of thinking, 
and if the technique is made clear to them as a method, they 
should be able to build up helpful processes consciously that 
should promote independent thinking. 
Or perhaps a simpler method of approach, which many 
teachers use unthinkingly, is to confront the pupil’s mind 
with a series of conventional questions, beginning with such
-P-A-G-E-116
102 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
words as “how,” “why,” “when,” “where,” “who,” “which,” 
and all the interrogative pronouns or adverbs. Pupils are 
seldom made to understand that they may start their own 
thinking processes independently on any problem by using 
these stock words, and that in doing so they are running their 
problem through such categories of thought as cause and 
effect, process, function, sequence, critical discrimination, or 
time, place, and personality associations. It is surprising to 
see the results that may be secured in discussions or composi- 
tions when pupils in the upper grades or the high school are 
definitely shown this simple knack, by working out some il- 
lustrative exercises in the class period. Few of us realize 
how extensive a place this process plays in the evolution of 
any extended discussion, how much of our literature is based 
on just this simple outline, and to what extremes of inde- 
pendent research this method will compel one to go, if one 
insists on finding answers or solutions. Dewey’s own plan 
of problem-solving will be analyzed more fully in the follow- 
ing chapter. 
Assicnment: Apply the method suggested in the paragraph 
above to some subject or topic you have never thought about 
before. Make a random selection. Jot down the ideas or 
problems that come to you. Try making these over in an or- 
ganized outline. 
Such analyses of the thinking process as this of Dewey’s 
have done much, in recent years, to help us to build up a con- 
scious technique of study. The analysis becomes so clear 
that we can trace it quite clearly, step by step, and can train 
pupils in the conscious use of the method and help them to 
make the use of such study technique more or less automatic 
— ahabit of thinking. There is much more hope of a “trans- 
fer of training”’ than there was in the old doctrine of uncon- 
scious and inevitable mental discipline, which claimed such 
transfer from any specific mental act to general abilities.
-P-A-G-E-117
SUPERVISED STUDY 103 
It is along this line that such explanations as Dr. Judd’s 
“generalized experience,” ' or Dr. Bagley’s “concepts of 
method,” ? give us a far more definite task as teachers. 
Robinson’s classification of types of thinking. It is, how- 
ever, necessary for adequate problem-solving that we should 
have still more such analyses of different phases or types of 
thinking. A stimulating suggestion along this line has re- 
cently been made in an important non-educational book, 
The Mind in the Making, by James Harvey Robinson.? The 
four kinds of thinking, with a brief explanation of each, will 
help us to understand various forms of problem-solving that 
the teacher should have in mind. 
a. The reverie, or “free association of ideas.” This the 
author describes, as follows: 
We all appear to ourselves to be thinking all the time during our 
waking hours, and most of us are aware that we go on thinking 
while we are asleep, even more foolishly than when awake. When 
uninterrupted by some practical issue we are engaged in what is 
now known as reverie. This is our spontaneous and favorite kind 
of thinking. We allow our ideas to take their own course, and this 
course is determined by our hopes and fears, our spontaneous de- 
sires, their fulfillment or frustration; by our likes and dislikes, our 
loves and hates and resentments. There is nothing else anything 
like so interesting to ourselves as ourselves. All thought that is 
not more or less laboriously controlled and directed will inevitably 
circle about the beloved Ego. 
b. Practical decisions. Decisions form the second main 
type of thinking, of which the author writes: 
The reverie, as any of us can see for himself, is frequently broken 
and interrupted by the necessity of a second kind of thinking. We 
have to make practical decisions. Shall we write a letter or no? 
Shall we take the subway or a bus? Shall we have dinner at seven

well worth reading for every teacher.
-P-A-G-E-118
104 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
or half past? . . . Decisions are easily distinguishable from the free 
flow of the reverie. Sometimes they demand a good deal of careful 
pondering and the recollection of pertinent facts; often, however, 
they are made impulsively. They are a more difficult and labori- 
ous thing than the reverie, and we resent having to “make up our 
mind” when we are tired, or absorbed in a congenial reverie. 
Weighing a decision, it should be noted, does not necessarily add 
anything to our knowledge, although we may, of course, seek fur- 
ther information before making it. 
c. Rationalizing. The next type is described in the follow- 
ing words: 
A third kind of thinking is stimulated when any one questions our 
belief and opinions. We sometimes find ourselves changing our 
minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told 
that we are wrong we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. 
. .. Few of us take the pains to study the origin of our cherished 
convictions; indeed, we have a natural repugnance to so doing. 
We like to continue to believe what we have been accustomed to 
accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast 
upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of ex- 
cuse for clinging to them. The result is that most of our so-called 
reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we 
already do. 
The writer next goes on to show how this necessitates a 
distinction between “good” reasons and “real” reasons for 
our beliefs, and then continues: 
This distinction between “good” and “real” reasons is one of 
the most clarifying and essential in the whole realm of thought. 
. .. This spontaneous and loyal support of our preconceptions — 
this process of finding “good” reasons to justify our routine be- 
liefs—is known to modern psychologists as ‘rationalizing’ — 
clearly only a new name for a very ancient thing . . . And now the 
astonishing and perturbing suspicion emerges that perhaps almost 
all that had passed for social science, political economy, politics, 
and ethics in the past may be brushed aside by future generations 
as mainly rationalizing.
-P-A-G-E-119
  SUPERVISED STUDY 105 
d. Creative thought. Of creative thought, the author being 
quoted writes: 
It is that peculiar species of thought which leads us to change our 
“mind... . This kind of meditation begets knowledge, and knowledge is 
really creative inasmuch as it makes things look different from what 
they seemed before and may indeed work for their reconstruction. 
Several striking examples are then given of creative 
thought in 
the realm of modern scientific achievement, which furnishes the 
most striking instances of the effects of scrupulous, objective 
thinking. But there are, of course, other great realms in which the 
recording and embodiment of acute observation and insight have 
wrought themselves into the higher life of man. The great poets 
and dramatists and our modern story-tellers have found them- 
selves engaged in productive reveries, noting and artistically pre- 
senting their discoveries for the delight and instruction of those 
who have the ability to appreciate them. 
3. Other forms of studying 
Accurate observation as study. We must next notice two 
modes of study that are prominent in all the sciences, and 
that have, therefore, made the most important of all con- 
tributions to the progress of civilization. There are two 
characteristic methods of working in scientific discovery 
and invention, and both these methods constitute a promi- 
nent phase of the study of sciences in the schools. This is 
largely because imitations of these real-life methods are most 
impressive ways of re-learning the discoveries of the pio- 
neers, and also because training in the technique of observa- 
tion and experiment are invaluable in the preparation and 
training of future scientists. 
As methods of teaching, observation and experimentation 
will be taken up in a separate chapter dealing with labora- 
tory work (Chapter VII). As forms of study we will be 
justified in making some further analysis of observation and
-P-A-G-E-120
  106 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
experimentation at this point. As observation is the earlier 
and simpler of these two phases of scientific study, we may 
take this up first. 
As characteristic of scientific method we must distinguish 
observation from the idle curiosity and inconsequential at- 
tention we give to things about us. Keeping our senses 
alert for all familiar or novel sights and sounds as we go 
about does not constitute observation, in the scientific sense. 
Neither is the poet’s or novelist’s keen insight into nature 
and man, even of the realistic type, with its artistic descrip- 
tion or its inspiring analysis, of the scientific type of obser- 
vation. All such observations, whether they be of the cas- 
ual practical sort or of the intense artistic type, are not made 
with that freedom from personal interest or emotional bias 
which would put them on the plane of cold-blooded, impar- 
tial, mathematically exact fact which science demands. 
The scientific observer must be able to set aside all subjec- 
tive bias; he must note and record his observations so ob- 
jectively and accurately that they may be verified by any 
other investigator who wishes to confirm or challenge his 
observations. 
This scientific method has been strikingly described by 
Professor Thorndike in the following words: ! 
The judgments of science are distinguished from the judgments 
of opinion by being more impartial, more objective, more precise, 
more subject to verification by any competent observer, and by 
being made by those who by their nature and training should be 
better judges. 
Science knows or should know no favorites and cares for nothing 
in its conclusions but their truth. Opinion is often misled by the 
“unconscious logic of its hopes and fears,” by prepossessions for or 
against this or that book or method or result. Science pays no 
heed to anything but the facts which it has already made sure of; it 
puts nothing in the scales but objective evidence. Opinion trusts 
  
1 Thorndike, Edw. L., Principles of Teaching, pages 265-66.
-P-A-G-E-121
  
SUPERVISED STUDY 107 
its personal impressions, bows to authority and follows the crowd. 
Any one’s opinion constantly favors the methods he is used to and 
is suspicious of new ideas except his own; it accepts without verifi- 
caticn and rejects without a fair trial. Science seeks precise quan- 
titative measures of facts by which changes and correspondences 
may be properly weighed; opinion is content to guess at amounts of 
difference and likeness, to talk in the vague terms of more or less, 
much and little, to rate a method as better or worse without taking 
the pains to find out just how much better or worse it is. Science 
reveals the sources of its evidence and the course of its arguments, 
so that any properly equipped thinker can verify for himself the 
facts asserted to be true. Opinion offers itself to be accepted or re- 
jected, but not to be verified or intelligently criticized. Science is 
the work of minds specialized to search after truth and selected as 
fit for the work by their equals and superiors in it. Opinion is the 
occasional thought of those who, though important and capable 
people, are yet only amateurs in the work of getting truth. 
Experimentation as a form of study. Independent Re- 
search and Experimentation. The other characteristic 
phase of the scientific method of study is experimentation. 
This is merely a more highly organized and a more techni- 
cally careful method of observation. The phenomenon or 
process to be observed or studied is so arranged that the fac- 
tors involved, such as causes, conditions, and results, may be 
controlled. This control is effected by exclusion, by factors 
being kept constant, by their being allowed to vary but by 
keeping an accurate measurement of the variations, or, if 
any factor is uncontrollable, by repetition of the experiment. 
in such a way that such factors may be averaged or practi- 
cally neutralized. The extent of the presence of uncon- 
trollable factors ultimately determines the real values of the 
conclusions drawn, and accounts for the varying degrees of 
perfection possible in different sciences, or of different laws 
or principles in any one science. 
The fundamental idea in experimentation, as in observa- 
tion, is the accuracy of the measurements involved, whether 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
    
108 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING | 
this measurement is of causes, conditions, or results, and so 
the progress of a science may be said to depend on the inven- 
tion of more and more accurate instruments of measure- 
ment. This accounts for the fact that the history of science 
is so largely the history of the improvement in telescopes, 
microscopes, micrometers, and all the variety of inventions - 
looking to the perfection of measurement. The purpose of 
such measurement is the expression of scientific observation 
in mathematical or statistical terms, which makes their 
analysis, comparison, manipulation, and verification more 
possible and more accurate. 
How do these two scientific methods of study vary from 
other types that have been described? They often involve 
a reading-background and accompaniment; they involve the 
most systematic, painstaking, and rigorous thinking. But 
they also involve the manipulation, often of a highly compli- 
cated form, of objective, real materials, and such an unlim- 
ited succession of the same or slightly variant type that the 
conclusions offered may safely involve the broadest general- 
izations, in the form of laws, principles, and even of pro- 
phecies about all phenomena of the type involved. 
AssIGNMENT: Read any chapter in Libby, The History of Science, 
and report on concrete illustrations of any of the statements 
made in this section. 
Practicing a skill a form of study. In another form of 
study this manipulation of material is still more prominent, 
but is carried on for another purpose — the mere gaining of 
skill in the manipulation of the material. This ranges from 
the very low level that may be exemplified by the attain- 
ments of a juggler, to the highly respected and inspiring ac- 
tivities of the various arts, such as music, sculpture, and 
painting. In some of this skill-training the term “study” 
finds a natural context. We speak of studying music and 
painting, and speak of these as study in a most respectful way.  
-P-A-G-E-123
  SUPERVISED STUDY 109 
It will be seen from the illustrations given that we can 
easily analyze three elements as being prominent in such 
activities: 
a. Physical control or skill, in its narrower sense; 
b. A codrdination of this physical control with certain mental 
activities, the type of mental activity being more or less com- 
plex; and 
ce. An appeal to the feelings, especially pleasurable, in both those 
who perform and those who witness the performance or view 
its results. 
In some cases, as in the performance of the juggler, there is 
a low type of feeling aroused that may be described as idle, 
amused, marvel. In others, as in the case of highly merito- 
rious performances in the fine arts, there is a stirring of the 
noblest and most inspiring esthetic sympathies and appre- 
ciations. 
The study of such skills usually involves varying degrees 
of two distinct psychical developments — habits and ideals. 
In some forms of study in skills the habit, the automatic 
control, is almost exclusively present. In the worthier forms 
of such skill-studies the idealism is most prominent, that is, 
the idea plus the emotion, while the physical habit involved 
is a mere necessary incidental. 
A further discussion of the training in skills will be taken 
up in Chapter IX. 
Attentive listening as a form of study. Certain methods 
of instruction, notably the lecture method of the universities, 
compel us to recognize another possible form of study in 
attentive listening. This differs really but little from the 
type of study found in reading. The difference merely lies 
in the fact that the ideas come to us through the sense of 
hearing instead of sight. The similarity lies in the fact that 
ideas are communicated to us in the form of words, or verbal 
symbols, which are in both cases the same.
-P-A-G-E-124
  110 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
As an effective method of learning listening involves the 
necessity of some adjustment on the part of the learner. 
The symbols and their ideas come to us but once, and are 
then usually beyond reach for further contact. To make a 
more or less complete, permanent record of a lecture, note- 
taking is resorted to. In connection with this adjustment to 
study from oral instruction, experimentation has established 
several principles of value to the student. These may be 
given in the form of the rules given by Whipple: 
a. If your work includes attendance at lectures, take a moderate 
amount of notes during the lectures, using a system of ab- 
breviations, and rewrite these notes daily, amplified into a 
reasonably compendious outline.! 
b. Whenever your desire is to master material that is at all ex- 
tensive and complex, make an outline of it. If you also wish 
to retain this material, commit your outline to memory.” 
In a previous chapter it was pointed out that in such 
activities the outlining must not be carried to the point of 
excessive detail.® 
ce. Before beginning the advance work, review rapidly the previ- 
ous lesson.‘ 
This is one of the most valuable and yet one of the most 
neglected rules of study, whether applied to textbook or lec- 
ture work. The principles of apperception, or perspective, 
of “warming up” — all have an important bearing on the 
significance of this rule. Teachers could do much to put 
students into this reviewing attitude. In textbook work a 
brief summary quiz on the previous lesson will help pupils 
feel that reviewing is part of their preparation. 
In lecture work, a brief summary of the preceding day’s 
lecture, or an habitual quiz of a few questions, especially

with reference to the general organization, will do much to 
motivate such review of the notes taken the previous day. 
II. Supervisep Stupy 
The significance of supervised study. We must now turn 
to that distinctive form of teaching method, recently devel- 
oped as a new sort of instruction technique, known as super- 
vised study. This method is notable because it has con- 
sciously set before the teacher two new attitudes with refer- 
ence to her profession: 
a. Responsibility for learning must be thrown on to the pupil far 
more than has commonly been done under the textbook-reci- 
tation plan of school work. The pupil must be made inde- 
pendent in his study. 
b. The teacher must consciously direct the pupil in methods of 
study so that he may become efficient in his independent work. 
In order to do this successfully teachers and teacher- 
trainers have themselves been compelled to make a more 
exact analysis of the technique of study in all its varieties, 
and have had to invent means of explaining these to the 
pupils and of illustrating the various study methods in prac- 
tice exercises. 
To students of education in normal schools and univer- 
sities we must give preliminary warning that, as a result of 
their own experience in the public schools, and especially in 
high school, the term “supervised study” is apt to be mis- 
understood. Supervised study is not “policed study” — 
the type so commonly found in the “study-room” periods of 
a departmentalized school. The activities of such a study 
period, as far as both students and teachers are concerned, 
are quite different from those found under “supervised 
study” properly so called. In the old form of policed study 
the tea disciplin. he teacher’s function is almost wholly disciplinary; she is 
there simply to keep or see that all students get a fair
-P-A-G-E-126
  } 
112 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
chance to study during the period. The students are all 
studying whatever lesson they please, and often are prepar- 
ing very distinctive types of work for different grades, for 
different teachers, and in different subjects. 
Definition of supervised study. Supervised study may be 
called directed study. The teacher gives very definite direc- 
tions as to steps, methods, and goals of work, and makes 
personal examination of the work of individual students 
without interfering with the continuing study of all others. 
It is a substitute for the inefficient and wasteful “recitation” 
activities of the class-period on the one hand, and for the 
fictitious “home study” of the pupils on the other. The 
studying is usually done under the same teacher who gave 
the assignment, and the teacher usually devotes her time to 
supervision, that is, to supplementary direction and to test- 
ing and approving the work of the pupils. She either moves 
about the room as pupils call her attention, or they come to 
her desk for consultation as they need it. 
An analysis of supervised study. Supervised study is pos- 
sible under two very different conditions. It may be in- 
stalled in its most complete and thoroughgoing form by ad- 
ministrative arrangements within a particular school or school 
system. Or it may be used as a device for teaching within a 
particular classroom, even if administrative arrangements 
are not made for its complete installation. 
If supervised study is instituted by administrators in a 
whole building or system, two characteristic conditions will 
be found: 
One arrangement is the division of the day’s schedule in 
such a way as to provide for study periods during the school 
time of such length as to get the best results, and to bave 
such study periods, even in a departmentalized school, ar- 
ranged in such a way that the pupils will do practically all of 
their study in each subject under the supervision of the
-P-A-G-E-127
  
SUPERVISED STUDY 1138 
teacher who makes the assignments and does the testing, 
and who conducts the recitations in that subject. 
The other administrative arrangement for supervised 
study recognizes the fact that, if assignments and study are 
carried on by this plan, there will be quite a large opportu- 
nity for differences in ability and application to assert them- 
selves among the various pupils in any one class. 
If supervised study is carried through in this thorough- 
going way, individual instruction and individual progress 
will be such important elements that it will be found that 
the brighter pupils will cover satisfactorily any semester’s 
work in one half to one third, or even one fourth of the time 
taken by others. In that case the administration will be 
required to make provisions for a very elastic system of in- 
dividual or small-group promotions. The only alternative 
will be the provision of widely differing courses of study in 
parallels, so as to give the brighter pupils a very much 
larger field of work to cover in the same time taken by the 
average or slow pupils and for a course limited to minimal 
essentials. 
Whatever may be said beyond this of supervised study as 
a method of classroom instruction will also apply to super- 
vised study with the above administrative conditions pro- 
vided. 
Essentials of supervised study as a teaching device. If 
we suppose a school where the administrative arrangements 
are not made for its most successful prosecution under the 
longer-period plan, and where pupils cannot be given the 
advantages of promotion according to their abilities or ap- 
plication, the classroom teacher may still take advantage of 
the supervised-study method for at least a part of her reg- 
ular work with any given class, or in any particular subject, 
or for occasional periods. 
In either case the teacher must understand that supervised
-P-A-G-E-128
  114 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
study as a classroom method involves the following four es- 
sential activities: 
a. Careful, detailed assignments or study-guides. 
b. Study by the pupils under the supervision of the teacher that 
made the assignment. - 
ce. Supplementary, individual supervision and direction of the 
pupils, to round out the general assignment, and while the 
actual studying is going on. 
d. Individual testing of the progress of the pupils. This activ- 
ity, and the one immediately preceding, must be conducted in 
such a way as not to disturb the continued study of all other 
pupils in the class. 
) The purposes and advantages of supervised study. Be- 
fore analyzing these four steps in detail, it may be advisable, 
in order to understand the method more fully, to make some 
statement about the purposes and advantages of the super- 
vised-study method of teaching. 
Where the full administrative arrangements mentioned 
above have been made for the supervised-study plan, there 
are two important initial advantages: 
a. Effective school study is substituted for the ineffective, 
wasteful, and probably unwarranted expectation of home- 
preparation; and 
b. Bright pupils are given a fairer chance to make the most of 
their abilities. 
There will be far less chance to bring the charge, now 
growing in seriousness, that the school is not only neglecting, 
mentally starving, but criminally spoiling this most valu- 
able social asset of genius and leadership. At the other ex- 
treme, the slower pupils will be given a chance to proceed 
through any given piece of work at a rate commensurate 
with their powers, without either being discouraged by the 
repeated failures inevitable under a rigid system of promo- 
tion, or being compelled to waste a large proportion of their 
time in repeating work it is not necessary to repeat.
-P-A-G-E-129
  
SUPERVISED STUDY 115 
Where the administrative arrangements mentioned have 
not been made, and the method is confined to the individual 
classroom, there are advantages in its use that have been 
demonstrated by careful experimentation, and that appeal 
to any thoughtful teacher as of sufficient weight to challenge 
her to some experimentation with the supervised-study 
plan. Primarily, the supervised-study method is aimed at 
doing away with the disgraceful waste of the ordinary “‘reci- 
tation period” in courses involving the use of a textbook. 
4. Guiding Pupils in their Study 
One of the principal functions of the teacher is to guide 
her pupils in their study activities. It may be worth while 
to see this in its larger relationships, before making a de- 
tailed analysis of this particular phase of the teacher’s 
work. 
The four-fold duty in pupil training. In a sense it may be 
said that the teacher has a four-fold duty or relation to her 
pupils: 
. She must guide and lead them in their work. 
. She must police them while at work. 
. She must test the results of their work. 
. She must inspire them with proper attitudes toward their 
work, and toward the relationship they have and will have in 
life outside of school. aeons 
A higher conception of the teacher’s work will result if 
greater emphasis is put on the first and last of these than is 
commonly found at present. Too many teachers, with im- 
proper training and inadequate ideals of their profession, 
are content to do their work on the hack level of policing and 
testing. The words are chosen with a purpose. The prob- 
lem of discipline, of keeping a class or room in order, and of 
calling pupils to account for their work is too often thought 
of as a satisfactory day’s work for a teacher. A much higher  
-P-A-G-E-130
  16 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
ideal should be set for the profession, and this should dom- 
inate most of the teacher’s relationships with her pupils — 
to teach them how to work, and to instill in them the desire 
and the will to work, not to satisfy the teacher or to please, 
not to meet her requirements and tests, but to work for 
the real values and rewards that such work will bring. 
This does not mean that the teacher is to be a preacher, to 
spend her time exhorting pupils to work. It means an ef- 
fort to gain a sympathetic understanding of the needs of the 
children as learners, a clear professional understanding of 
how these learning needs may best be met, and most impor- 
tant of all, to give them an attitude toward, and a vision 
about, the values of the things that are to be learned that 
will inspire the pupils with a realization of these values. If 
this guidance and inspiration is present, the policing will 
become merely incidental to greater and more permanent 
gains. The inspirational function of the teacher may largely 
be a matter of personality, which some think beyond the 
possibility of direct training, and the most important of her 
qualifications or disqualifications. Personality may be sub- 
ject to development and cultivation, but in either case it 
lies outside the field of the present discussion. 
Beginnings of supervised-study technique. But the work 
of guiding pupils in their study is a matter of technique, and 
is capable of being acquired and developed systematically 
and progressively. Just what may and should be done in 
such study-guiding is the problem of this section. 
One of the earliest accounts we have of an experiment in 
supervised study brought out an interesting condition of af- 
fairs that illustrates the needs and possibilities along this 
line of guiding pupils in their study. In one of the progres- 
sive high schools in Illinois, in a pioneer experience with 
supervised study, the school day was divided into six periods. 
: No classes were scheduled for the sixth period, but on Mon-
-P-A-G-E-131
SUPERVISED STUDY 117 
days the pupils went for this last hour to that teacher to 
whom they recited during the first period of the day, on 
Tuesdays to the teacher of the second period, and so on. 
This extra period each week was supposed to be devoted by 
the teachers to explaining to the pupils just how they were 
to study that particular subject — English, history, algebra, 
or whatever the case might be. 
A few weeks after the experiment had been started the 
teachers met in a faculty meeting to discuss their experi- 
ences. The interesting development was that first one, then 
another, and finally most of the teachers declared that they 
had to admit the plan was a failure, as far as they were con- 
cerned, because they simply were at a loss as to what to tell 
their pupils. They had never fairly faced the problem of 
study-guiding. But the experiment was made a success, be- 
cause the teachers were determined to show they were wor- 
thy of their work and would learn how to guide the pupils’ 
study in their several subjects. The development of such 
study-guiding technique, a product of the supervised-study 
movement, has now reached a stage where we have a num- 
ber of books of general guidance for teachers in such mat- 
ters,! as well as several of a series dealing with the supervis- 
ion and guidance of study in particular school subjects.” 
Levels in study-guidance. This leadership or guidance of 
the pupils in their study may take one of several phases,

some dealing with particular lessons or even specified tasks 
in a lesson; other types of this guidance may involve direc- 
tions for studying a particular school subject, or the method 
of study for a whole month or a semester’s work; while the 
most generalized form will consist of giving pupils rules or 
methods of study that will hold for any subject or for any 
teacher at any time. These various levels of study-guiding 
will be explained and illustrated in detail, proceeding from 
the very specific to the more general. 
Definite and exact assignments. The improvement of the 
assignment is one of the values that has come to teaching 
technique from the supervised-study movement. For many 
years educators and supervisors had been denouncing the 
bad-assignment habits teachers had easily and naturally 
fallen into in connection with the textbook-recitation-testing 
method. Assignments were hurried, perfunctory, and often 
unpremeditated statements like these: “Take so many lines, 
or problems, or pages in advance for to-morrow,” or “The 
advance lesson will be from page 60 to 65, middle of the page, 
to the topic, Washington Crosses the Delaware.” 
A bare statement of the limits of the advance lesson con- 
stituted the assignment. The method of preparation was 
taken for granted. All the pupils knew was, that they would 
be expected to “recite” in the usual manner. There was no 
evaluation of the new material. There was no recognition 
of the fact that there were different degrees in thoroughness 
of preparation, or in method of reading and study. There 
was hardly a consciousness that almost every pupil had his 
characteristic conception or misconception of what “study” 
meant. Occasionally there was a bit of introspection and 
readjustment in the pupils’ study “methods.” 
As the pupils came to a new teacher, it was found that the 
method of work that had been done the semester before was 
inadequate or excessive. Some of the pupils readily made  
-P-A-G-E-133
  SUPERVISED STUDY 119 
the adjustment on their own responsibility, others floundered 
in a daze until continued failure made them conscious of the 
new needs, or until the teacher discovered the necessity for 
some general suggestions about preparation. Some pupils 
would never discover the rule: “In general, use in your 
studying the form of activity that will later be demanded 
when material is used,” ! even in its academic implications. 
Some pupils would expend their ingenuity in evolving a 
method of evading the “form of activity”’ that the academic 
situation would methodically demand. Others blindly per- 
sisted in applying their particular and often limited concep- 
tions of study to every situation and for every teacher. 
Highly conscientious pupils have been known who were ab- 
solutely at a loss to know what was the matter with a teacher 
who would not let them recite their history lesson after they 
had gone to the trouble of memorizing it. Equally consci- 
entious students, to whom study meant several careful read- 
ings, resented the injustice of failing on some particular de- 
tail, like a date, that the teacher expected to have mem- 
orized without telling them so, when their general know- 
ledge of the whole lesson was superior to what was accepted 
as satisfactory from other pupils. 
Model assignment in American history. We may con- 
trast such indefinite, irresponsible assignments with the 
following: 
The assignment is for a week’s work in a seventh-grade 
class on Chapter XII of Thwaites and Kendall’s History of 
the United States. Note that the assignment involves con- 
siderable planning and preparation of material by the 
teacher. Also note how a variety of general methods are in- 
cluded, without any “recitation-testing.” The assignment 
is made on the first day the new chapter is taken up, let us 
suppose Monday, at the beginning of the period.

    120 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
For the next five days we are to study Chapter XII, “The Con- 
quest of New France by England.” We will first take ten minutes 
for the class to glance over the chapter to find the main points in 
Questions I, II, and III! written on the blackboard. As soon as 
you think you have found them, write them down. Write your 
name at the top of the paper. They will be passed in at the end of 
the ten minutes. Begin. 
These papers will be glanced over by the teacher during 
the succeeding study period when the assignment has been 
completed, and should yield some helpful diagnosis of indi- 
vidual needs. When time is called, have the papers passed 
in by a system that will bring them to the teacher in the 
order pupils are seated by rows and seats. Some such di- 
rection as, “Pass the papers to the right or left or forward, 
and put your own on top of those you receive,” will effect 
this. 
As soon as the assignment for the rest of the week has been com- 
pleted, I shall pass out the test we are to have on this chapter on 
Friday. We will have a study period to-day and to-morrow; you 
will use the test for a study-guide.? 
When you get the test, first try to recall what you wrote in your 
outlines, and then fill in Questions I, II and III on the test after 
you have skimmed over the chapter. We will discuss this outline 
the first thing in our discussion period on Wednesday. Correct 
your test paper if your later study of the chapter shows you were 
wrong. When you have answered these questions, go ahead and 
fill in the rest of the answers on the study-guide test. 
On Wednesday we will have our discussion period. I shall call 
for topical recitations at that time on these topics which I have 
written on the board: 
1. How New Orleans Was Founded. 
2. Washington’s Expedition to the West. 
3. The Albany Convention. 
4. The Fall of Quebec.

SUPERVISED STUDY 121 
We will also discuss other questions on the test and any ques- 
tions you may want to ask. 
On Thursday we shall have a socialized recitation on the chapter. 
We will have special reports on these topics on the board.!_ I have 
made out slips for each topic with the references, and I will pass 
these out to the pupils who are to make the reports. If any of you 
have time and can find anything on these topics in any book, you 
will be prepared to take better part in the socialized recitation. 
We will have fresh test papers for the test on Friday. The test 
will be the same as that which I am handing out to-day. The test 
will be limited to 20 minutes. After that we will review any ques- 
tions you had difficulty with in the test. 
Next Monday we will have a study period for a review on 
Chapters VI to XII. I will give you, to-morrow, a copy of the 
test we are to have next Tuesday, and you will use that as your 
study-guide. If you have any time between now and next Mon- 
day you might begin your review by yourself.* 
Such specific assignments are especially necessary where 
the supervised study method is used. Pupils must work in- 
dependently and complete their work to the inspection or 
testing state with a minimum of additional individual di- 
rection. This will involve, in a group of mixed abilities, an 
excess of definiteness in the assignment, so that the slowest, 
least independent, have sufficient direction to proceed with 
the work. 
One of the most helpful devices for assignments in work of 
this sort is to give the pupils the test as a study-guide, as was 
done in the model assignment above. This involves making 
a test that shall not be a mere sampling, and that involves a 
thoroughgoing evaluation of most elements in the lesson. 
The use of objective devices in testing, like those that have 
been evolved in connection with the standardized tests in 
the various school subjects, will prove most helpful in work-

ing out a set of combination study-guide tests. This method 
will be explained in detail and will be fully illustrated in 
Chapter XI. 
AssIGNMENT: To what extent would the tests, given at the end of 
each chapter in this book, constitute a satisfactory study- 
guide? In what ways are they inadequate for this purpose? 
Does the instructor’s method affect their possibilities as satis- 
factory study-guides? 
General preparation in a particular subject. Directing 
pupils how to prepare generally in a particular subject may 
be done in connection with a variety of general methods of 
conducting the class period, but it is highly desirable in con- 
nection with the supervised-study method. ‘There is no 
reason why such directions should not be given even if the 
teacher is using the textbook-recitation method. Such 
study-guiding will be an important economy in connection 
with any method, since it will make the daily assignment 
much simpler, and the results much more satisfactory. If 
the teacher prefers a single consistent method of instruction 
in a particular subject for a whole semester, let the matter 
be explained clearly and frankly to the pupils at the begin- 
ning. When they show they have learned to adapt them- 
selves to the new method, the old condemned type of assign- 
ment, which merely states the limits of the advance lesson, 
may be justified. 
Model of more general assignment in literature. Let us 
suppose the pupils are to begin the study of The Lady of the 
Lake. The teacher’s method may involve the idea that it 
will be necessary for all pupils to read the poem through once 
quite carefully, at the beginning; that they must all do this 
at least at a certain minimum rate; and that there must be 
some method of daily accounting to show that each pupil is 
proceeding at this rate. The device of simple outlining 
(probably not the most advisable to keep the pupils from re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
SUPERVISED STUDY 128 
garding the reading of the poem as a task) is resorted to. 
The pupils are told that this outline is to be handed in each 
day, or that each must be prepared to read his topics. The 
assignment and explanation of method might be left at that 
stage. Far more satisfactory results will be secured if the 
first period is spent in helping the pupils to get a more 
satisfactory conception of how to outline the poem. The 
following steps in this introductory exercise would be help- 
ful: 
a. Show pupils how the stanzas correspond to paragraphs in 
prose. 
b. Show that the stanza units are either narrative or descriptive. 
ec. Indicate that a satisfactory topic for a narrative stanza would 
be a single sentence, that tells briefly what happens in the 
stanza. 
d. Similarly indicate that a statement of what is described is 
satisfactory for a descriptive stanza. 
e. Have as many of the opening stanzas read as the time of the 
class period will permit. Ask for several topic suggestions for 
each stanza, compare them, and select the best, giving reasons 
or having pupils give reasons for the selection made. 
{. Tell pupils they are to follow this method throughout the first 
reading as the daily assignments are made. 
General study-guiding. We must recognize successive 
levels, with distinctive needs, in study-guiding. In the lower 
grades we would hardly expect to meet with much success in 
trying to teach pupils some general principle of study tech- 
nique. At first our study-guides will be merely specific 
directions as to how to study a particular lesson. Later we 
may show pupils how to prepare work in a more general se- 
ries of lessons, or in a subject. We will begin to teach pu- 
pils how to study spelling or geography, or how to study 
arithmetic or history. Against a background of such ex- 
periences the pupil will later be prepared to gather general- 
izations as to methods of study, and he can be taught certain 
     
-P-A-G-E-138
  124 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Standard forms of attacking study problems which he can 
apply and modify as occasions demand. 
An illustration of study-guiding in this general way may 
be seen in the following directions, given to a university 
class in an introductory course in education in which Bag- 
ley’s Educative Process and Judd’s Introduction to the Sci- 
entific Study of Education were used as textbooks. It is in- 
troduced in full, not only as an illustration of the method of 
study-guiding, but also because it may serve the same pur- 
pose for this textbook, or for many of the textbooks used in 
education courses in normal schools or colleges. 
STUDYING EDUCATION; MODEL OF GENERAL 
STUDY-GUIDE 
I. Master the text. It is selected as the teacher’s estimate of the 
one best book in the field. But when the instructor assigns a 
lesson for reading or study, the problem is at once raised in 
the student’s mind, What do you want us to do with this? 
a. Why does that question naturally arise? 
(1) Either, you want to do as little with it as is neces- 
sary to satisfy the teacher. Is this a proper atti- 
tude? 
(2) Or, you are conscious that you can do very differ- 
ent things with any reading assignment, from 
“skimming” to memorizing. 
b. In content subjects you have a right to more complete 
and explicit directions. In Educative Process I want you 
to prepare for a quiz, as one of the devices for scoring 
or grading so large a group; and I want to be sure that 
you have studied the assignments thoroughly enough so 
that you will have an intelligent background for class 
discussions and lectures on supplementary material deal- 
ing with the same topics. You can’t tell just what de- 
gree of preparation that involves until you have had the 
experience of the first quiz. I can’t tell you just what 
that quiz will be like, of course, until the time comes. 
The first will be a sample of the succeeding ones. But 
I can tell you that you ought to get: 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
SUPERVISED STUDY 125 
(1) The general organization of the discussion in a 
chapter, or of the principal problems discussed; 
that the topical analysis of the Table of Contents 
will be of great help to you in picking this up as 
you study. : 
(2) That you ought to remember the outstanding 
points or divisions in any well-outlined section. 
(8) That where it is a question of an extended explana- 
tion or argument you should know the principle or 
proposition involved and some of the leading steps 
in the discussion. 
II. Problem solving. Look up any problem that is not clear to you 
in several other books. I could give supplementary refer- 
ences, but we ought to apply Whipple’s Rule 14 here, “Don’t 
apply for help until you have to.” You ought to learn the 
knack of finding your own supplementary references. Too 
much help is usually given here by university teachers. One 
of the valuable concepts of method in intellectual work, that a 
student should have acquired in high school, is often not even 
learned in the university until graduate work is taken up. 
Every undergraduate should have the knack of making a bib- 
liography. There are two reasons for this: 
1. It is the only way of developing intellectual independ- 
ence in research. 
2. It gives you an extended, first-hand contact with the 
literature of the subject. If-you are going into teaching 
you should do a lot of browsing in books on education, 
and especially in the indexes and tables of contents. 
In making such a search of educational literature, be sure 
you know just what you are looking for. We will work out 
an exercise on this some time soon. Tell us of a difficulty you 
met, how you went about getting supplementary material, 
and what you got out of the search in addition to what you 
started to find. 
III. Abstract and concrete. Get at abstract principles by inter- 
preting them in the concrete. When a psychological, philo- 
sophical, or social principle is applied to educational practice 
in the discussion, or is illustrated in a concrete way, it is easier 
to understand and more valuable to remember it so than in 
its more abstract form. However, if the abstract principle is 
quite clear to you, think it through for yourself by working up  
-P-A-G-E-140
  
126 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
examples or illustrations from your own school experiences or 
your present general stock of knowledge. 
IV. Read with a spirit of challenge. Do not hesitate to disagree 
with any opinion you see. In no professional literature are 
there so many enthusiastic hobby riders as in education. 
You have a right to your own opinion and you should think 
for yourself, but do not express your disagreement until you 
have a convincing line of argument worked up. 
V. Learn to skim. Should you outline this material into note- 
books? I should say, “No.” Why not? Outlining is unnec- 
essary, mechanical, laborious, and wasteful of time. Rather 
skim several times, discover the important parts, and devote 
the extra time to clinching the things that look big to you. 
Another helpful illustration of the application of psycho- 
logical analysis applied to the problem of general-study tech- 
nique is found in the following outline of a chapter entitled 
“Rules for Serviceable Memory,” in Seashore’s Psychology 
in Daily Life, chapter II. A careful application of these 
general rules for memorizing will have far more practical 
value than the “systems of memory” so widely advertised 
in some of the popular magazines.

Variety in class work. Where supervised study is used as 
a method of instruction it must be recognized that certain 
socializing values may be lost unless special provision is

128 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
made to conserve them. This may be illustrated by any of 
the content subjects. The history class lends itself specially 
to the development of the pupils along two important social 
lines. One of these is the ability to talk clearly and con- 
nectedly for some time to a small group. The other is the 
ability to take part in a more or less formal way in a general 
group discussion or conversation. These two social accom- 
plishments are perhaps best provided for respectively by the 
class exercises commonly called “Topical Recitations” and 
“Socialized Recitations.” 
The American history class furnishes interesting and im- 
portant content for these two types of social practice, be- 
cause talks and discussions of this kind use an almost identi- 
cal material and method to that found in adult life, in the 
large or small group discussions of civic problems and cu>- 
rent events. 
The general organization of teaching method outlined in 
an earlier part of the chapter (pages 119-21) involves four 
distinct phases of class activity: 
1. Initial study of a large unit (usually a chapter) of the textbook, 
on the basis of detailed assignment and under supervision, 
during the first two or three class periods. 
2. Supplementary presentation, for a single period, of certain 
selected topics in formal talks, or topical recitations. This is 
especially advised for narrative and descriptive sections of 
the text, or collateral reading. 
8. Supplementary group discussions of selected topics in a well- 
organized socialized recitation. This is especially advised for 
the discussion of explanatory and argumentative sections of 
the text, or collateral reading. The civic value of discussions 
of this type on problems that have arisen in our past history, 
and that are still prominent in the politics of to-day, should be 
recognized by every teacher of history. The detailed tech- 
nique of the socialized recitation will be taken up in Chapter X. 
4. Group tests on the material covered by these different exer- 
cises. Further illustration and explanation of economical and 
efficient devices for such testing will be given in Chapter XI.

Interest. As is implied by the derivation of the word, in- 
terest involves a recognition by the mind that there “is 
something between” the thing to which attention is directed 
and itself. That “something between” it and oneself usu- 
ally presents itself to the mind as an advantage, profit, sig- 
nificance, possible satisfaction, pleasure, or usefulness that 
may be derived if continued and more particular attention 
is given it. Interests may be purely intellectual, but more 
commonly have an affective or emotional accompaniment. 
Even in the simpler forms of mental activity, the mere per- 
ception of some familiar or some strange phenomenon, we 
are conscious of an accompanying feeling of pleasure or dis- 
comfort. 
Taken from another point of view, the things that interest 
us do so because we can clearly and readily recognize that 
that which challenges our attention has an advantage, mean- 
ing, or use for us either as an individual, selfish satisfaction, 
or because it has significance for the social relationships with 
which we have identified ourselves. These social relation- 
ships may be on the mere lower level of group consciousness, 
a modified form of egoism, or they may be on the much 
higher level of our ideals of service to a social group with 
whose welfare we have identified our highest interests. 
Motivating attention. The problem of interest plays such 
an important part in education because success in all teach- 
ing involves the arousing of sufficient interest to motivate 
study, that is, to get a pupil to reading or thinking about some 
topic or problem. Unfortunately the values or advantages 
of many phases of school work are not readily apparent to 
the learner. This is partly due to the fact that the material 
is necessarily found in an academic, artificial setting, and 
partly to the fact that the significance or advantage is so 
   
-P-A-G-E-144
180 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
remote, so far in the future, that the pupil is too immature 
to recognize these values. The teacher, as the representa- 
tive of a social organization which requires that the child 
* shall be prepared for a future which he cannot evaluate, and 
by means which do not readily appeal to his interests, must 
in some way motivate the learner’s attention in spite of this 
inability of the pupil to recognize his own great future and 
permanent interests in such matters. 
This school problem of motivating attention on remote 
interests has been met in various ways. 
Its validity and advisability have been challenged. This 
is a doctrine of interest that has become widespread in re- 
cent years, and constitutes one of the cardinal principles in 
Dewey’s philosophy of education.1 Whatever one may 
think theoretically about this attitude as a protest against 
the old extreme doctrines of formal discipline, and the 
“pouring-in”’ of logical systems of verbal information, there 
is no question but what this new attitude has evolved into a 
fallacy in the practices and applications of many of Dewey’s 
followers. It has resulted in a resignation to, or an abdica- 
tion in favor of, pupils’ whims, both as to what is included 
in, and excluded from, school work. We shall presently see, 
in connection with the discussion of the project method (see 
Chapter V) that a wholesome improvement is possible in 
the work of the schoolroom on the theory that “education is 
life,” and that it may be freed from much of its artificiality 
by a program that plans to make as much as possible of 
school activity similar to real-life activity. But this is far 
from identifying real-life interests with childish whims, and 
spasmodic likes and dislikes of the moment. The most in- 
genious teacher or curriculum-maker will easily give up in 
despair if he must find childish interests to attach certain 
items of learning to, which the real world values highly and 
1 Dewey, John, Democracy and Education, chapter x. 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  
  SUPERVISED STUDY 181 
will value still more highly. The solution of that difficulty 
by abandoning the attempt altogether may make school 
work easier and more agreeable for both teacher and learner, 
but will not serve the best “interests” of the child. Many 
teachers, if they were to adopt such a doctrine of interest, 
would have to abandon a considerable part even of those 
items curriculum-makers have set down, in their most dras- 
tic revisions, as ‘minimal essentials.” 
The curriculum-maker’s problem. This situation raises 
the whole question as to the relation of curriculum making, 
child psychology, and teaching technique. Because of the 
present prominence of the first of these three, the relation- 
ship of these different fields of education, especially the 
question of priority, is an important one. By priority we 
mean, Which of the three should be settled first? or, Can they 
be settled simultaneously? The curriculum-maker’s special 
problem is, “What shall we teach?” ‘The teacher’s special 
problem is, “ How shall we teach?” The child is an inter- 
mediate factor. Shall the curriculum-maker settle his prob- 
lem on the basis of social needs, or must he consult the child’s 
interests and capacities, and those at different levels of de- 
velopment? 
This depends somewhat on our conception of the curricu- 
lum-maker’s work. We may admit the more extended view, 
that he must not only select, but that he must also arrange 
and grade the material of the course of study. But the ques- 
tion still remains, “Shall he select his total content on the 
basis of social needs alone, or on the basis of those needs and 
the child’s interests also?” It is evident that the child’s ca- 
pacities and interests must be consulted in grading the ma- 
terial, if this can at all be done. But dare we include any 
items for which the child’s interest cannot be assumed, for 
which, in fact, a lack of interest in the average child is a far 
more reasonable assumption? Dare we omit such items if 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  132 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
social needs imperatively dictate their inclusion in the course 
of study? 
Intrinsic and extrinsic interest. Does not this predica- 
ment pass along the problem of “interesting” pupils in such 
items as the chief function and problem of teaching tech- 
nique? Or does this impose an impossible task? Dewey 
declares it is practically impossible to “interest” by extrin- 
sic means.!_ Most psychologists have taken a different posi- 
tion, and have argued the matter in a practical way by ref- 
erence to three types of attention, primary passive, active or 
voluntary, and secondary passive attention.? It is the inter- 
est involved in the last of these that we must especially use 
as an effective agency in study. 
The approach to secondary passive attention may be made 
through either of the other two forms, and such motivation 
involves appeals to extrinsic interests, or interests not im- 
mediately found in the content or subject-matter itself. The 
latter is the intrinsic interest which must be our ultimate 
goal in study and teaching. Extrinsic interests involve ap- 
peals to instincts such as pride, or rivalry, or approval, de- 
sires for reward, or fear of punishment. Whether interest 
snared by such devices results in efficient, permanent learn- 
ing values, is also a matter of controversy. But, as there is 
no experimental disproof of this, we shall probably be com- 
pelled to go on utilizing extrinsic motivation, if our experi- 
ence shows we can command working attention by it. 
If it is impossible to make tasks or topics or problems inter- 
esting that are initially uninteresting to children, the cur- 
riculum-maker will have to change his point of view from 
social needs to children’s interests. The teacher will have to 
abandon the attempt to deal with any topics or materials 
that do not command immediate and spontaneous attention

from the pupils. This is clearly impractical in school work, 
at least for the present. : 
A working doctrine of interest. A working doctrine of 
interest, as it affects the problem of motivating the attention 
of pupils in their study activities, may be summarized, from 
the foregoing discussion, in a series of propositions. 
1. Some interests need not be aroused. These are in a 
sense innate and universal. Attention is arrested by certain 
phenomena, and this compulsory type of interest has been 
identified in psychological nomenclature as being in the na- 
ture of “passive attention.” 
2. We must be very careful to conserve worthy natural 
interests. The child comes into the schoolroom with an em- 
barrassing bundle of interests. Many of these are instinc- 
tive. Others are unique, but still either specially inherited 
or developed so early and fully that we cannot distinguish 
the strong, acquired from the innate. A few of these may be 
pernicious; most of them will be helpful. AIl must be met 
with the greatest tact and thoughtfulness. Some may have 
to be wisely side-tracked. More may be guided and directed 
into useful channels. A single, strong, worthy, special inter- 
est in a child may be made a center for motivating a great 
part or all of the school activities. Suppression and opposi- 
tion should never be based merely on the inconvenience of 
such an interest in the schoolroom, if the interest is at all 
worthy. The greatest ingenuity should be used to utilize it 
and direct it to educational ends. 
3. Most persons can be interested in most things. By 
Providence, or whatever name we choose to give to the con- 
stituting force of the universe, persons and things seem to be 
so made that the bond of advantage or use can be recog- 
nized, if we can but overcome a momentary diffidence or 
reluctance or inertia in our minds. If we will but cross the 
threshold the house and its occupants will charm us. Psy- 
   
-P-A-G-E-148
  134 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
chologists introduce two other forms of attention here to 
describe the mental phenomena involved, voluntary or ac- 
tive attention, and secondary passive attention. These men- 
tal analyses are perhaps among the most useful education 
has drawn from mental science. 
4. Interests are classified as intrinsic or extrinsic. When- 
ever possible, intrinsic interest should be given the prefer- 
ence to motivate attention; but, corollary to this, extrinsic 
interest should be resorted to to overcome the initial reluc- 
tance to giving attention to elements which society judges of 
value for the immature. 
Thorndike’s evaluation of learning-process factors. Pro- 
fessor Thorndike has given us a helpful summary and a 
critical evaluation of the important factors involved in 
“improvement” in any learning process.! Seven factors are 
named: (1) Interest in the work; (2) Interest in improve- 
ment; (3) Significance; (4) The problem-attitude; (5) At- 
tentiveness; (6) The absence of irrelevant emotional excite- 
ment; and (7) The absence of worry.” 
Experimental data are given to prove the fact of the first 
two.’ The next three are evaluated in the following para- 
graph: — 
The three remaining doctrines of the “interest series,” I need 
only mention. The doctrine so brilliantly and earnestly defended 
by Dewey, that school work must be so arranged as to arouse the 
problem-attitude — to make the pupil feel needs and work defi- 
nitely to satisfy these — would probably be accepted by all, at 
least to the extent of agreement that pupils will progress much 
faster if they do approach work with needs which its accomplish- 
ment satisfies, and with problems whose solutions its accomplish- 
ment provides. The general principle of modern educational the- 
ory that school tasks must be significant at the time to those doing 
them — that a pupil must have some aim in work to give his work

SUPERVISED STUDY 135 
meaning — would also probably be accepted by all, at least to the 
extent of belief that pupils will improve faster in work the nature 
and purport of which they comprehend, than in mere serial intel- 
lectual gyrations accomplished slavishly and mechanically. Most 
orthodox of all is the doctrine that the attentive exercise of a func- 
tion will produce more rapid improvement than exercise of it with 
attention directed elsewhere.! 
Of the last two factors, Professor Thorndike says they 
“would perhaps be disputed.” After reviewing the argu- 
ments with reference to the value of “emotional excite- 
ment” as a factor in promoting learning, he comes to the 
following conclusion: 
All the facts concerning the relation of emotional excitement to 
improvement therefore seem to be explained best by supposing 
that the interest in the function’s exercise and improvement is the 
active force — emotional excitements being indirectly of value if 
they produce interest, and of value as symbols in so far as they are 
produced by it. They probably do not produce effective interest 
so often as has been supposed, the dynamic power of each emotion 
over behavior being able to exist without the crude inner excite- 
ments. When without them, the interest is less tiring and dis- 
tracting, and so more efficient.” 
With reference to the last of these factors, worry, he ar- 
rives at the following conclusion: 
Much the same sort of arguments could be reviewed in the case 
of worry or tension. Other things being equal, tension or worry 
simply wastes energy and distracts the mind, offering so much 
friction to overcome. Zeal, satisfaction at success and annoyance 
at errors, can be present with a relieved state of mind as well as 
with one wrought up to tension by emulation, dread of failure and 
the like; better, in fact.... Active mental life in the prosecution 
of intellect, morality, and skill can go on with no greater excite- 
ment than its own progress provides and with no greater tensions 
than the cheerful alertness of quiet interest. Emotional peace and 
relaxation seem indeed, as I interpret the facts of behavior, to be, 
in and of themselves, always favorable to improvement.

PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Does “study” include the exercise of creative imagination? Would 
you say a poet, a novelist, a musical composer, or an artist is “study- 
ing” when he is engaged in creating an artistic masterpiece, especially, 
as in the case of the poet or novelist, if the creative work is a bit of 
free “fancy”? 
2, Write a list, after thoughtful introspection and analysis, of just what 
you do when you “study.”’ Do this from the point of view of the men- 
tal operations involved. Then make the analysis from a “behavior- 
istic” point of view. 
8. Make a more critical study of Whipple’s “Rules for Study.”’ !_ Think 
of them in the light of such questions as the following: —Which, if any, 
do you consider superfluous? Which would you emphasize on the 
basis of your own experience? Should these rules be “graded”; that 
is, would some be more applicable or appropriate for elementary 
school, high school, or university students? Which could you use as 
goals for teaching pupils the technique of study? Do you know 
whether any of these rules have been quite well established by careful 
experimentation? Do you consider any of them could not be deter- 
' mined by the experimental method? 
4, Formulate a list of the “methods” of study you feel you have acquired 
in your experiences as a student. Does any of these methods have a 
history? Can you tell how and when you acquired it? 
5. Do you recall any particular teacher who distinctively contributed to 
your efficiency as a student? Write a detailed account of this service. 
Do not confuse this training in study technique, with “inspirations.” 
6. Select a particular “study” problem. Outline the “technique” you 
propose to follow in your attack.

1. What the project method is 
Why the project method is developing. Dr. Cubberley, 
in discussing the newer conceptions of educational work, 
points out that, among other recent changes in school work, 
“the commercial and industrial life of the community began 
to be utilized to give point to the instruction in manual 
training, local history, civics, geography, and other related 
studies.” In the same connection he refers to a similar re- 
gard for social and civic needs. 
This movement has hitherto found larger expression in 
the content of the school work than in the method. These

-P-A-G-E-155

new conceptions are revolutionizing the material of the cur- 
riculum, are introducing all sorts of new subject-matter, are 
eliminating much of the dead-wood in the conventional 
“subjects,” and are rapidly changing the emphasis on a 
great variety of topics. 
It remains to instill this same spirit into method, as well as 
into materials. The project method is destined to go far in 
modifying teaching practices, because it offers the means of 
adjusting the learning to the newer subject-matter and the 
more vital needs of real life. 
This suggests lining up our methods with the keynote of 
Dewey’s philosophy of the relations of school and society. 
As expressed in the same connection, we may again quote 
Dr. Cubberley’s brief summary of the Dewey point of view. 
The school . . . began to change from that of a place where chil- 
dren prepare for life, by learning certain traditional things, to a 
place where children live life and are daily brought into contact 
with such real industrial, social, community, and life experiences 
as will best prepare them for the harder problems of living which 
lie just ahead.! 
Tt would seem reasonable enough that this aim can best 
be attained by change in method, as well as in materials. In 
fact, it would seem impossible of attainment without method 
that does not approach real-life activities. Real-life activ- 
ities, as a substitute for academic exercises, are introduced 
for a double purpose — the stimulation of interest in the 
real-life activities themselves, and the building of habits for 
immediate use outside, as well as within the school, and for 
the future as well as for the present. 
When this spirit is incorporated into the teacher’s tech- 
nique, we are likely to find activities and materials that will 
justify our calling such work teaching by either the problem 
or the project method. The recent introduction of these

-P-A-G-E-156
  142 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
methods has been met with a great deal of enthusiasm, 
some confusion and controversy, and some excesses. 
In order to show the meaning of the project method in its 
restricted and unrestricted usages, and to show its relation 
to the problem method (one of the more violent phases of 
the controversy), we may attempt to trace its evolution 
from other methods and from certain related movements 
outside the field of methods. 
Evolution of the project method. In Chapter III we saw 
how, during the last generation, the inductive development 
method practically dominated the schoolroom practice of 
trained teachers, while the recitation on textbooks was the 
easy refuge of the inexperienced. 
Out of the inductive lesson plan there evolved a teaching 
philosophy that included one item which is an important 
feature of the project method, the idea that every lesson 
must have a clear aim or purpose, in the mind of both teacher 
and pupil. How this “purposefulness” has been extended 
and emphasized by the project advocates will be shown 
when we take up a discussion of the definition of “project.” 
The other important element in project teaching is “‘real- 
life” activity, as much like the natural acts of the outside 
world as we can make activity in the more or less artificial 
setting of the schoolroom. This element gained prominence, 
during the last generation, through two simultaneous and 
rather independent movements in education. One of these 
was the educational philosophy of John Dewey; the other 
the manual training and vocational instruction movement. 
That part of Dewey’s creed which is most closely connected 
with the project method development is his insistence that 
school must be thought of “‘as life, not as a preparation for 
life.’ We have already shown (page 43) that the negative 
side of this statement is to be taken as the natural exaggera- 
tion of the reformer, a protest against an extreme academic
-P-A-G-E-157
PROJECT AND PROBLEM METHODS 148 
disregard of the child’s present-day needs and interests. The 
worth of the positive side of this philosophy, and its rapidly 
growing acceptance among teachers and educational lead- 
ers, is shown as clearly by the wide spread of the project 
method as by any other school practice of the present time. 
Ready agreement and thoughtful effort are being made on 
every hand to introduce “real-life” attitudes and activities 
into the work of the schoolroom. 
Origin of the term. The term “project” itself came into 
general use and application from the manual training and 
vocational training activities. These subjects imported the 
word into the public schools. An extended constructive or 
experimental undertaking, which involved careful prelim- 
inary planning and the statement of an aim or purpose, often 
in the form of an exact drawing or blue-print, had come to 
be spoken of as a “project” by engineers, scientific agricul- 
turists, and the like. Manual training teachers came to use 
the term for the individual constructive undertakings of their 
pupils. Such undertakings had the two essential character- 
istics which every project should have in any field of study 
where an attempt is made to vitalize teaching by the meth- 
ods of the workshop or field work. These were: (1) the clear, 
definite purpose; (2) a genuine real-life activity. 
Another element which is a common characteristic, though 
not an essential one, in the project method was probably 
taken over from the supervised-study movement. This is 
the idea of the large unit of individual, self-directed learn- 
ing. The significance of this will be seen presently when 
we come to discuss the topic, “What the Project Method 
is Not.” 
Relation of the project to the problem. One other element 
that has played a most significant part in the evolution of 
the project method is the relation of “project” to “prob- 
lem.” It has already been stated that this is a prominent  
-P-A-G-E-158
  144 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
center in the controversy about the new method, the con- 
troversy hinging about whether one or the other of these 
terms is generic or specific. Attempts at definition of the 
two synonyms have been rather fruitless when attempted on 
the etymological basis, for one is derived from Greek and the 
other from Latin words meaning exactly the same thing. 
It is advocated here that the best interests of teaching 
practice would be promoted if we could come to use the 
project method in its more restricted sense; use “problem” 
as the generic, and “project” as the specific term; and use 
the problem method for certain forms of school activity, and 
the project method for others. It is believed that we will 
ultimately have to come to this, both from the history of the 
use of these words in non-educational activities, and for the 
sake of clearing up a confusion about the meaning of “‘pro- 
jects” that is resulting in the introduction of certain activ- 
ities in the schoolroom that border on the ridiculous. The 
fact that many of these practices are designated as projects 
by those who perpetrate them may result in the discrediting 
of any kind of “project.” This would be a serious loss to 
the development of teaching technique, for there is one type 
of project which involves rare and wholesome possibilities 
for the improvement of school work. 
An illustration to distinguish the terms. An illustration 
may be given to justify the claim that all problems are not 
projects, and that “problem” should probably be thought of 
as the generic term. Problem-solving can be done on vari- 
ous planes. These planes may first be stated abstractly, 
and then be illustrated. 
1. Some problems may be solved on a strictly mental plane; such 
problems are contemplative, reflective, academic, suppositi- 
tious. Perhaps a subdivision of such problems might be 
thought of as vicarious, reconstructive, imaginative. 
2. Some problems may be solved in a symbolical way. Some  
-P-A-G-E-159
  
PROJECT AND PROBLEM METHODS 145 
mode of expression must be used, such as speech, written lan- 
guage, drawing, modeling, etc. 
8. Some problems may be solved in the realm of the real, the ma- 
terial, the physical, the practical. For this type of problem- 
solving we ought to reserve the term “project method.” The 
chief educational argument for this is that this type of pro- 
blem-solving has been too long kept out of the schools. Pro- 
blem-solving in the classroom has been too exclusively men- 
tal and symbolical. 
Now let us see how a particular problem might be solved 
successively on each of these three planes — mental, sym- 
bolical, real. Let us suppose a man is planning the building 
of ahouse. He may construct the general plan and most of 
the detail, and compute his approximate costs almost entirely 
on the mental plane. He may imagine and reason out his 
floor plan, and the dimensions of the rooms and their rela- 
tion to one another. A part of this mental process may be a 
critical reconstruction of several of his neighbors’ houses; he 
may solve his own problem by vicariously re-solving theirs, 
— “if I had been in his place, I would have done so and so,” 
he reasons or supposes. 
Out of this mental solution he may, and usually does, soon 
proceed to the symbolical plane. He makes a rough sketch, 
and then a dimension drawing; he puts down specifications 
in words; he computes costs in actual figures instead of rough 
estimates. If his problem is an expensive and important 
one, and if he is not experienced in the matter, he takes his 
crude sketch and estimates and specifications to an archi- 
tect. Except when he assumes the work of a contractor or 
superintendent, the architect’s solutions of house-building 
problems are all carried out on the symbolical plane. The 
symbolical solution is usually superior in accuracy and effi- 
ciency to the purely mental; all symbols were invented by 
man for that purpose. An expert plan now shows the house- 
builder how a door here, a window there, and the dimensions 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  146. PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
of a closet, as he had mentally placed them, are not feasible. 
The third phase of the house-building problem is the real 
construction. Its superiority over the second is much 
greater even than the superiority of the second over the 
first plane of solution. We are not thinking here of the mat- 
ter of use, but merely as a solution of the problems involved. 
Defects in the solution, which even an expert’s symbolical 
solution had not foreseen, now become apparent. And a 
house-builder often comes away from such an enterprise 
with the thought, “If I ever had to build another house, I 
would never do this or that.” 
From the illustration it must be apparent that there are 
hosts of problems — for example, the vicarious living over 
of the experiences of others in history — which cannot even 
be raised to the symbolical plane of solution. They must 
remain in the mental realm, in imagination and reason. 
Others can never pass for solution beyond the symbolical 
plane. Such is much of the problem material in geography. 
Real solutions are open only in projects of travel, or creation. 
But where problem-solution can be raised to the plane of 
reality we have the only final and true solution — the pro- 
ject method. There are many problems that cannot be ap- 
proached on the project plane, owing to the artificial condi- 
tions necessary to the schoolroom. This artificiality means 
unlikeness to real-life outside, a condition which is more or 
less inevitable for organized mass education. 
Definitions of the project method. The literature dealing 
with the project method, already extensive and growing rap- 
idly, treats largely of three topics: (1) Efforts at definition, 
many of them comparative and controversial; (2) Accounts 
of a variety of unique teaching experiments, some worthy 
and some ridiculous, which are described as projects; and 
(3) Efforts to work out project programs for the various 
school subjects.
-P-A-G-E-161
  
PROJECT AND PROBLEM METHODS 147 
Assignment: Glance through several of the references given in 
a bibliography on the project method and classify them as 
indicated above, or suggest other divisions to the classifica- 
tion, if you think necessary. 
The first formal attempt to launch the project method 
was made by Dr. Kilpatrick, of Columbia.! In this article 
the first systematic definition was given. The project was 
defined as “a whole-hearted, purposeful activity proceeding 
in a social environment, or more briefly in the unit element 
of such activity, the hearty, purposeful act.” This defini- 
tion may be interpreted as containing the two essential fea- 
tures of a project in the restricted sense.we are trying to in- 
sist on as advisable — the “‘purposefulness”’ and the “real- 
life activity” — although it must be admitted that the sec- 
ond of these essentials is expressed in a most abstract form, 
so much so that it has been lost sight of or abandoned by 
some of Kilpatrick’s more ardent followers. The result has 
been that any “purposeful” school activity has been in- 
cluded by them in the project method. 
A more accurate and satisfactory definition has been ad- 
vanced by Stevenson.? His definition is: — “‘A project is a 
problematic act carried to completion in its natural setting.” 
This definition has some advantage in relating project teach- 
ing to problem-solving, although the word “problematic” is 
unfortunate in that it is commonly thought of as synony- 
mous with “questionable, uncertain, unsettled, doubtful.” 
Taken in its context in his book, however, it is clearly seen 
as a convenient substitute for the phrase, “involving a 
problem.” ‘The latter part of the definition has a distinct 
advantage in clearness over Kilpatrick’s definition. Ste- 
1In an article in Teachers’ College Record, vol. x1x, no. 4 (September, 
1918). 
2 In his book, The Project Method of Teaching (1922). This book is quite 
the most consistent and balanced discussion of the method.  
-P-A-G-E-162
  148 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
venson’s advantage in his discussion of the project method 
lies in that he approached the matter from the point of view 
of the project in the teaching of agriculture — its original, 
uncorrupted setting. However, when he extends his illus- 
trations to the field of the more academic subjects, he too 
fails to discriminate between symbolical problem-solving 
and solutions in “a natural setting,” which has otherwise 
been quite clearly adhered to as a “real-lifelike” activity 
solution. 
Other definitions of the project method might be intro- 
duced, some accurate, others very loose. Definitions have 
been attempted in the Journal of Educational Method which 
make the “‘project method” comprehensive enough to em- 
brace all educational activity, such as administration, cur- 
riculum-making, child psychology, etc. It is perhaps less 
confusing and more helpful to try to adhere to the interpre- 
tation of the “project method” as a method of classroom 
instruction, even though we recognize that method may in- 
volve implications for the curriculum and child study, and 
vice versa. One’s educational philosophy must be involved 
in the discussion of what to teach, and how to teach, and 
why, and when. The clearest solution of these questions 
can only come by considering them first as separately and 
as distinctly as possible, and then considering problems of 
reciprocal relationship and implication. 
From the point of view of a strict interpretation we may 
then, from the foregoing discussion, adopt the following as a 
working definition: A project is a definite and clearly purpose- 
ful task, and one that we can set before a pupil as seeming to 
him vitally worth while, because it approximates a genuine 
activity such as men are engaged in in real life. The pro- 
ject method is the solution of problems, on the real plane of 
activity. 
Illustrations of “ projects” in English work. The signifi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-163

eance of the elements in this definition can perhaps be 
brought out best by illustrations in English work in the up- 
per grades and the high school. The distinctions will be 
clarified and the values of the method emphasized by using 
this subject, because it is perhaps most open to reform from 
the artificial, academic traditions. 
English lends itself readily to the use of the project method. 
The Committee on the Reorganization of English in Second- 
ary Schools has pointed this out. They say: 1! 
The subject-matter of English consists primarily of activities, 
not of information. It provides a means for the development of 
ideals, attitudes, skill, and habits rather than for the acquisition of 
a knowledge of facts and principles. That is to say, English as a 
high school study is to be regarded primarily as an art, not as a 
science, and is to be learned by practice rather than by general- 
ization. 
But this is far from the common view and practice of 
English teachers. Grammar is “learned” as a science. 
Textbooks on rhetoric are treated as “content” material. 
Literature is studied and tested as fact-cramming for college 
entrance examinations. So much of the literary study is 
“about” the classics and their authors — so little “of” the 
book itself. 
Analyzing out the needed skills and habits. Emphasis 
should be put on skills and habits, especially on the latter in 
composition work. 
The great problem is to have the school activities by which 
these habits are formed as far removed as possible from arti- 
ficial, academic exercises for drill, and as nearly as possible 
like the genuine real-life activities they are intended to pro- 
vide for. 
In literature the emphasis will be directed toward atti-

Bureau of Education, Bulletin no. 2 (1917), page 33. 
   
-P-A-G-E-164
  150 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
tudes, habits, and ideals. The last is to be a by-product 
from the content. Habits of reading, and of good reading, 
will be developed by the real-life activities. Attitudes to- 
ward good, bad, and indifferent art can also best be devel- 
oped as by-products of activities in selection, sampling, and 
criticism. 
The problem then would seem to become one of stating 
definitely and concretely the projects or enterprises we 
should undertake that will give training in the activities the 
high-school student needs now for efficiency in all his school 
work, and will need for efficiency in his later and larger prac- 
tical and social environment, as well as training in the lit- 
erary activities that will enrich and inspire his life now and 
that will form tastes for a rich leisure occupation after 
school days are ended. 
When we have built up a list of such essential activities, 
the processes involved will find their functional place. So, 
for example, with the rules of grammar and the principles of 
rhetoric. In the end we shall have a useless residue of ma- 
terial found in the logical organization of the technique that 
may be quietly left to atrophy in appendixes. In the case of 
literature we will have left aside the burdensome barriers of 
introductions, and the hurdles in the footnotes and glossaries. 
We will have kept the pupil in contact with the thought and 
feeling of the masterpiece, by virtue of which it has lived, 
and will have left the study of technique and form to their 
proper place in the university training of specialists. 
Projects for a course in English “Expression.” In line 
with this point of view the following tentative list of “‘pro- 
jects” for a high-school course in English is presented. The 
projects are expressed from the point of view of the teacher, 
rather than that of the student. At the close of the list a 
practical mode of attack is suggested in planning the work 
with any particular project.

154 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
2. What the project method is not 
A variety of school activities are being designated as 
“project” teaching which should not be so called. This does 
not imply at all that such activities are undesirable. Some 
are as worthy and educative as the project method itself, 
and should be conserved or extended. A few are not desir- 
able. Some of these activities probably inadvisably called 
projects may be reviewed, with reasons for their not being so 
designated. 
The project not merely an individualistic school exercise. 
The adaptation of school work to individual abilities, needs, 
and interests is as important in the progress of education as 
any movement that could be named. Even if a teacher has 
pupils working individually, by the textbook, with collat- 
eral, or under the supervised-study plan, while it may be a 
big undertaking to her—a “project” in the sense that an 
engineer or a real-estate promoter uses the term — it does 
not necessarily follow that the individual pupil’s work is 
clearly “purposeful” to him, and if he is carrying on his 
work by any of the above methods there is probably very 
little of “‘real-life” activity involved in it. 
The project not even any extended, unified piece of study. 
The course of study is undergoing radical alterations, at 
least in the discussions of curriculum reformers, and, no 
doubt, some of the important changes proposed will be com- 
ing in sooner or later. These proposed revisions are largely 
along two lines: 
1. Revisions within subjects, by eliminations, additions, 
and substitutions; 
2. Rearrangements or codrdinations between subjects — 
cross-sections of materials from geography, history, civics, 
language, and reading are being collected around new uni- 
ties, some natural, others artificial.

  PROJECT AND PROBLEM METHODS 155 
The introduction of such new divisions of work is also 
often called a “project,” ! though such reorganization may 
also fall short of meeting either or both our criteria of the 
true project. Often the “purposefulness” is more apparent, 
the reorganization and codrdination being around more 
natural centers of pupil interests and pupil needs; but, while 
this one criterion may be fairly met, and although such top- 
ics cover a wide range, the term “project” should be applied 
only if the learning is carried on in connection with a “‘real- 
life” activity. 
The so-called “‘play-project.”” There is even closer ap- 
proach to the true project in an extension of the above form, 
where the learning is carried on in the realm of play. But 
even a learning process, involving a considerable unit of 
related material, and made fascinatingly “purposeful” 
through play activities, should not be unqualifiedly desig- 
nated a project. We might well call such an activity a 
“play-project.” Why insist on such close discrimination? 
Play is indeed the child’s life, his “real-life” activity, but we 
ought to look at the matter against a broader background. 
Play is a symbol, a pretense of work, an imitation of “the 
genuine activity men are engaged in in real life.” 
An illustration may serve to clarify the distinction. A 
child may learn valuable lessons in making a toy sled, or a 
wagon from paper — lessons of muscular control and codrdi- 
nation, of measurement, of mechanical relationships, even of 
elementary geometry in the making of wheels that will turn 
true. The whole exercise can rise to higher and more val- 
uable processes and learning experiences the nearer it comes 
to making a real sled or cart — real in materials, dimensions, 
and usefulness. The paper model or toy is clearly a symbol; 
the dividing line between the “play-project” and the real 
1See Bonser, F. G., The Elementary-School Curriculum. Macmillan, 
1921,
-P-A-G-E-170
  156 PROGRESSIVE: METHODS OF TEACHING 
project must be, in this case, the criterion of use. In other 
instances the dividing line between symbolical and real ac- 
tivity might be quite imaginary and hard to draw. 
Again, it must be clear that, although we would do better 
not to call a play activity, whether individual or a codpera- 
tive group activity, a “project,” no prejudice or criticism is 
implied against the spirit or method of play as a useful 
factor in learning. “Play-projects” may even make a more 
interesting appeal to the child at certain levels than do work- 
projects — may appear far more “purposeful,” and may 
even involve more necessary and efficient learning. 
Self-initiated activity not a “project.” The term “pro- 
ject” should not be loosely applied to any self-initiated activ- 
ity of the child. This is often done by kindergarten and 
primary teachers, and there is perhaps more danger of dis- 
crediting the whole project method here than from any other 
form of enthusiasm. Spontaneity, self-direction, initiative, 
and exploration are all worthy attitudes to be developed, 
especially in children in the earlier school levels. The child, 
though, makes many false starts in his spontaneous activ- 
ities, and if every bit of self-initiation is to be hallowed by 
encouragement because it is mistakenly conceived of as a 
“project,” because it is “purposeful,” the teacher may build 
up a sanction for lawlessness and chaos. 
Free play, for example, may accidentally call three blocks 
of wood a train, but, seizing on the accidental whim to de- 
velop a transcontinental system of transportation that re- 
quires the whole room for its orientation and all the avail- 
able material for towns and termini, with all the rest of the 
children mere inhabitants of some way-station, is neither 
good teaching nor good learning. If such teaching is to be 
called project teaching it were better to abandon it at once. 
“Projects” not extreme, unconventional forms of activity. 
Any extreme form of this undirected and uncontrolled spon-
-P-A-G-E-171
  PROJECT AND PROBLEM METHODS 157 
taneity, running under the guise of “project method,” is still 
more objectionable. It is possible to find teachers, in some 
of the larger systems over which the project movement has 
swept as a “fad,” to be doing all sorts of informal, uncon- 
ventional things in the schoolroom, without having any 
sound educational basis for such practices, and justifying 
their vagaries by boasting of their “projects.” This un- 
thinking type has endangered many a hopeful, progressive 
innovation. It is largely because the project method holds 
such large possibilities, if wisely restricted and definitely de- 
fined, that it seems regrettable that some of its leading ad- 
vocates should indulge in vague, abstract generalities. It 
seems most unwise that an effort should be made to glorify 
an innovation in schoolroom methods into a revolutionizing 
movement by dragging into it all educational problems to 
the confusion of well-intentioned teachers. 
It is unfortunate, too, that the Journal of Educational 
Method should have been so called instead of the Journal of 
Educational Methods. The project method is not the only 
method, or all of method. The Herbartians made the same 
mistake of abstraction. There is a variety of general meth- 
ods, and we have reached a stage in teaching technique 
when the professionally trained teacher is eclectic in her 
methods. She knows one type of work will best serve her 
pupils’ learning in one subject, and another in another, or 
she changes from method to method in dealing with differ- 
ent topics of the same subject, or in dealing with pupils of 
varying abilities. 
Not vicarious living-over of others’ problems. One more 
type of school work that has wrongly been called project 
work must be noted. The project method should not be 
applied to the imaginative, vicarious living-over of others’ 
problems, as in history, nor in the working out of reasoned 
solutions of type problems, as in geography. This type of 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  158 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
school activity has been styled project work by Charles 
McMurry in his book on The Project Method. The lesson 
suggestions outlined in this book are worthy, helpful class 
exercises, but they are merely the old inductive develop- 
ment-type lessons dressed over and given anew name. Some 
attain the level of what we might have styled the “problem 
method,” if this method had ever had a fair chance to estab- 
lish itself. It must be apparent, on a little reflection, that 
history is not at all suited to the project method, if we insist 
that the two criteria of “purposefulness” and “real-life 
activity” must both be met for true “projects.” The solu- 
tions in history problems must all be on the purely mental 
plane, except possibly for the statesmen of the day in deal- 
ing with current history. 
Not curriculum reorganization. The project does not 
necessarily involve curriculum reorganization. This ques- 
tion has already been opened above, on page 154, but must 
be examined more fully. Several of the most helpful books 
written in connection with the project method ! take the 
necessity of this reorganization of the course of study for 
granted, and try to further both these school reforms by 
combining them. This is unfortunate and open to serious 
objections. It was pointed out above that curriculum re- 
organization is being conducted along two related lines, 
(1) reform within subjects, which we may call vertical reor- 
ganization, and (2) changes in related materials in different 
subjects, which may be called horizontal reorganization. 
If wholesale changes are made in the latter way, there is 
bound to be a revision too radical for school administrators 
and teachers to meet. Curriculum reform will make its

-P-A-G-E-173
PROJECT AND PROBLEM METHODS 159 
greatest progress if it is kept within the accepted divisions of 
subjects. The project method advocates have attempted too 
extensive changes in the curriculum on the horizontal plan. 
This puts the teacher using it, especially in departmentalized 
work, out of gear with all other parts of the course of study. 
Reform of this sort involves too many conflicts, repetitions, 
and, most serious of all, omissions in the conventionally- 
arranged courses with their subject divisions. 
Moreover, curriculum revision is developing a highly 
scientific technique of its own, and presents such an exten- 
sive and important problem that it is engaging the work of 
trained specialists. The average teacher can codperate with 
this reorganization of the course of study by suggestion, ex- 
perimental application, and criticism, but she is not equal 
to the task of making important modifications individually. 
It may as well be recognized that “courses of study” are 
“handed down” to the teacher by her superintendent, or in 
county or state manuals, and that this is going to be neces- 
sary for many years to come in order to make a school sys- 
tem work as a system. Definite limitations for each grade 
have to be accepted, and an instructional organization 
within subjects must be followed. 
This does not imply the impossibility of teaching by pro- 
jects. ‘‘Purposefulness,” practical motivation, and “real- 
life” activities can be introduced in the teaching of a par= 
ticular topic in arithmetic, in language, or in most other 
subjects without going to the extreme of mixing up all re- 
lated material in all other subjects. Project teaching would 
probably gain in definiteness if the problems involved could 
be reduced to a workable simplicity within the lines laid 
down by the present course of study. 
Assignment: Describe some lesson you have seen that was im- 
properly designated a “project.” Why was it so called, do 
you suppose? Why should it not have been so designated? 
What type of lesson was it really?

3. Limitations of the project method 
In teaching history. The idea has just been suggested 
that the study of history is poorly suited to the project 
method, if we are to insist on the criteria that have been in- 
cluded in our working definition. It must be admitted that 
history is largely an informational subject; one that can best 
be covered by wide reading associated with a fairly well mas- 
tered outline or core, usually gathered from a carefully con- 
densed textbook. Helpful aid in this reading activity, pur- 
sued by the textbook and collateral methods, may be gained 
from the occasional use of other methods, such as object les- 
sons, dramatic expression, topical recitation, drill, lectures, 
and discussions. Much of the material may be given helpful 
organization, especially in reviews, by the problem method. 
This last method will be taken up more fully in the next di- 
vision of this chapter. The other methods will be dealt with 
in later chapters. 
Aside from dramatization, which is merely play or “sym- 
bolical” solution, or possibly an excursion to nearby points 
of historical interest, which is merely a modification of the 
old Pestalozzian object and observation lesson, there is very 
little chance for any genuine activity in the study of history. 
This may be as unfortunate as it is true, and may be one rea- 
son why so little history really “sticks.” 
Reading. In this connection we may well scrutinize our 
working definition more closely. Is not reading, especially 
serious reading for clear understanding and more or less 
ready use in the solution of mental problems, a “real-life 
activity,” and if it is pursued with the conscious or implied 
purpose, as in the case of history, of applying it to the under- 
standing of current problems, is it not highly “‘ purposeful”? 
Does it matter in the case of history whether the problem or 
purpose by which the reading is motivated be civic, politi-
-P-A-G-E-175
  PROJECT AND PROBLEM METHODS 161 
cal, or cultural? It is just here that we have to justify our 
insistence on a strict construction of the project, or we have 
to yield to the confusion and indefiniteness that has been 
warned against. 
To answer the problem we have to open the issue again 
whether the “school is life, or a preparation for life.” Does 
not the issue lie in whether we can motivate the study, find 
a purpose for it, in the present, immediate needs of the 
reader, some real, not academic, problem that must be 
solved now, and can best be solved by a certain line of read- 
ing? May not the identical reading or study activities of 
two students be actuated by such different motives that one 
may be said to be taught by the project method, and another 
by some other method? 
Let us suppose two pupils reading a particular chapter in a 
textbook on Animal Husbandry, one for the definite purpose 
of learning just what to do in a practical problem in real 
livestock feeding, the other for the purpose of passing a test 
the next day. There is absolutely no question here as to 
which form of motivation is “purposeful” in the truest sense 
of the word, or which is the more effective, or advisable, if 
either were possible as methods of teaching the subject. 
An eighth-grade history lesson. Now let us return to 
our problem in the field of history. How can we motivate a 
lesson for an eighth-grade pupil in American history so as to 
make it truly “life,” rather than a “preparation for life’’? 
Can we do it on the civic or political plane? The eighth- 
grade child has no functional use for what he studies about 
the tariff or slavery, or even banking, as far as history is con- 
cerned. We shall see presently how it may be quite different 
in the field of community civics. In so far as the civic and 
political values can be recognized for the child (though 
hardly by him), his American history is all a “preparation 
for life.” So it is on the cultural plane. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  162 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
The illustration may be drawn still closer from the view- 
point of useful purpose. If the child has any functional 
“life” use for his American history it may possibly be found 
in his patriotic attitudes or activities, in the truest and wor- 
thiest sense of the term. Let us suppose he is studying Lin- 
coln’s fight on slavery as part of his preparation for a public 
Lincoln-Day program. Does this motive make his study 
activity a project? The line might be hard to draw here. If 
the program were a school exercise, the term “‘ project ” would 
not apply in the intention of the definition given. If it were 
a public program, if his part in it were like that of an adult 
orator before a real audience, the whole activity might well 
be called a “project.” His speech on Lincoln might be quite 
as informing, as moving, as that of the adult. It must be 
evident, though, that the study of American history on this 
high plane of real use would rarely be feasible. 
AssIGNMENT: Try to formulate another “project” in American 
history, for an eighth-grade pupil, that would be equally “pur- 
poseful” and “‘real.”” Let several of the most plausible be 
criticized and discussed in class. 
In geography. It has already been intimated that similar 
difficulties would be met if one were to attempt to teach 
geography by the project method. Sand-table and “yard” 
projects have been described in detail in some of the litera- 
ture. Are not these “object lessons” wholly on the symbol- 
ical or play level of problem solution? Is there not, more- 
over, as much danger of misinterpretation of the realities of 
distance and material from the miniature topography as 
there is in a map or globe? 
There are some topics in geography that might be at- 
tempted by the project method. The teaching of local 
geography offers the most likely field. Such problems as 
the getting of proper conceptions of direction, of distances, 
of areas, of the relation of maps to reality, of industries, or
-P-A-G-E-177
  
  PROJECT AND PROBLEM METHODS 163 
of elements connected with local transportation could be 
worked out — with “realities.” The activities should be 
carefully scrutinized, however, for it would be likely that the 
method in studying some of these might more properly be 
designated as belonging to the “object-lesson-observation” 
method to be discussed in Chapter VII. Field excursions 
would be more properly classified there than under the pro- 
ject method. 
In other subjects. Illustrations might now be given of 
subjects in which the project method would be suitable and 
advisable generally, but where limitations would still have 
to be recognized in dealing with important topics. 
English has already been cited as especially adapted to 
the project method. But in such an important phase of 
language work as the correcting of common-error habits, the 
simple drill method is best, and probably the only feasible 
method of learning. Although such drill has a worthy 
“purposefulness,” the activity must be strictly academic. 
It may even be that better motivation can be secured by 
artificial devices of competition, games, rewards, and the 
like, than by an appeal to the more purposeful values of 
real life. 
Civics, especially in its more recent form — reformed con- 
tent as distinguished from the old course in civil govern- 
ment — is another school subject offering rich opportunities 
for true project teaching that should not be neglected. 
Many problems in community civics can be solved by chil- 
dren in the elementary grades, even by actual participation. 
The newer textbooks are rich in suggestions as to how school 
children can codperate in sanitation or city beautifying cam- 
paigns; how they can be used as true molders of public opin- 
ion in times of elections. Mock trials, congresses, conven: 
tions, and elections pass from the real project to the play- 
project level. Trips to public buildings, improvements, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  164 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
legislative assemblies more properly belong to the “object- 
lesson-observation” type of method. The latter forms may 
be just as effective and are often more feasible than the 
project method. The experiences involved are highly worth 
while from the educative point of view. Some study of our 
national and state governments cannot be neglected, how- 
ever, yet undertaking it as a true project is quite out of the 
question. 
Science teaching, also, has important project possibilities 
in addition to, and distinct from, the object-lesson and lab- 
oratory methods now already in common use. 
4. The problem method 
What this method is. Hither as a phase of the project 
method, or as a clearly differentiated parallel type lying 
about midway between the inductive-development lesson 
and the project lesson, it will be worth while to develop the 
problem method. Its relation to these, in the historical 
growth of teaching technique, has already been noted. For 
our present purposes its distinction from these may be 
briefly restated. As related to the project method, which, 
as we have seen, involves a “problematic” act, we would do 
well to reserve the term “ problem method” for teaching pro- 
cesses that deal with problems on the purely mental plane, 
or on that phase of the symbolical plane which we would 
not designate as “play projects.” The problem method, as 
related to the inductive-development lesson, would deal 
with any mental problem not specifically involving induc- 
tion or generalization from particulars. It would involve 
such reasoning processes as explaining cause from effect or 
effect from cause, or the reorganization of learned data to 
apply to new solutions in current needs. 
Reference has also been made to the fact that the original 
suggestion for the problem method came from John Dewey,
-P-A-G-E-179
  
PROJECT AND PROBLEM METHODS 165 
especially in his book How We Think, and more specifically 
in Chapter VI of that book. 
For convenience we may quote a concise synopsis of 
Dewey’s plan from Strayer’s Brief Course in the Teaching 
Process (pages 59-60): 
In the ordinary course of our thinking the sequence is as follows: 
We find ourselves in a situation which presents a problem which 
demands an adjustment; we make a guess or formulate an hypoth- 
esis which furnishes the basis for our work in attempting to solve 
the problem; we gather data in the light of the hypothesis assumed, 
which, through comparison and abstraction, leads us to believe our 
hypothesis correct or false; if the hypothesis seems justified by the 
data gathered, it is further tested or verified by an appeal to ex- 
perience; that is, we endeavor to see whether our conclusion holds 
in all cases; if this test proves satisfactory, we generalize or define; 
and lastly this generalization or definition is used as a point of ref- 
erence or truth to guide in later thinking or activity. 
There is danger that we may overlook the very great importance 
of inference in this process. We cannot say just when this step in 
the process will be possible, but it is possibly the most significant of 
all. A situation presents a problem. Our success in solving the 
problem depends upon our ability to infer from the facts at our com- 
mand. Often many inferences will be necessary before we succeed 
in finding the one that will stand the test. Again with the problem 
in mind we may be conscious of a great lack of data and may post- 
pone our inference while we collect the needed information. There 
is one fallacy that must be carefully guarded against in dealing with 
children, as also with adults; namely, the tendency once the infer- 
ence has been made to admit only such data as are found to support 
this particular hypothesis. 
It is evident from the last sentence that the term “‘in- 
ference” in the second paragraph is used as a synonym of 
hypothesis in the first. 
Steps in problem-solving. The steps in problem-solving 
may be summarized as follows: 
a. Recognition of the problem. 
b. Formulating an hypothesis.
-P-A-G-E-180
166 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
ce. Gathering data and applying the hypothesis. 
d. Further testing of accepted hypothesis. 
e. Application of hypothesis as accepted. 
These steps form a good outline of the main points in a lesson 
plan for the problem method. 
Such analyses as that of Dewey’s of the thinking processes 
are doing much to help us build up a conscious technique of 
study. The analysis of problem-solving becomes so clear 
that we can trace it step by step, train pupils in the con- 
scious use of the method, and help them to make the use of 
such study technique more or less automatic — a habit of 
thinking. 
* It is, however, necessary for adequate problem-solving 
that we should have still more such analyses of different 
phases or types of thinking. A stimulating suggestion along 
this line has recently been made in Robinson’s The Mind in 
the Making. The four kinds of thinking there given, with a 
brief explanation of each, have already been outlined in the 
previous chapter (see page 103f.). His fourth type, that of 
“creative thinking,” is closely allied to the “problem-solv- 
ing” method. 
The problem method another name for scientific method. 
It is apparent from the descriptions of the different types of 
thinking which were discussed in Chapter IV (pages 96- 
105), that when we speak of problem-solving, and the value 
of developing a conscious control of its technique, it is 
largely in the type of “creative thought” that we must seek 
worthy questions for study and discussion, with some possi- 
bility of finding worth-while material in the field of “prac- 
tical decisions.” It should also be said that in the context 
of his book Professor Robinson shows clearly that true 
problem-solving can only be attained by “‘scientific method” 
— the method used in the sciences. This follows closely the 
steps outlined in Dewey’s scheme, and involves an emphasis
-P-A-G-E-181
  
  PROJECT AND PROBLEM METHODS 167 
on several of the steps that we ought to notice. These are: 
a. Clear statement of the problem. Problems cannot be 
selected at random and quite outside any related experience 
of the pupil. The best problems will be suggested by diffi- 
culties of the pupils in the work at hand, and will often be 
expressed by them. These will usually have to be restated 
by the teacher before they can be made the subject of study 
or class discussion. Out of her experience with the subject 
and grade she is teaching the teacher will gradually accumu- 
late a considerable list. These should be carefully recorded 
and preserved for future use, together with helpful sugges- 
tions for their solution, such as sources of data that have 
been found helpful or interesting. 
b. Make the problem a constant, purposeful aim in all the 
work. The greatest danger in working with the method of 
problem solving, whether on the mental plane or in the real- 
ities of a project, is that of losing sight of the main object of 
study. Much of the material in a reading problem will not 
immediately appear to be clearly related to the work in 
hand. The contributory material or activities, therefore, 
often tend to become ends in themselves instead of contrib- 
uting to the unitary solution sought. Training in direct, 
straight, eclectic thinking can be secured, if there is a con- 
scious practice of checking up repeatedly, and measuring 
the activity or discussion by the problem that constitutes 
the point of departure, and the solution of which is the goal 
of study. 
c. Stimulate the proposal of definite hypotheses. Dewey, in 
this connection, goes into considerable detail to show the im- 
portance in good thinking of the “cultivation of a variety of 
alternative suggestions.” ! Parker,” who has worked out the 
1 Dewey, John, How We Think, page 75.

20.

168 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
whole question of “problem-solving” more fully than has 
been done in any book on methods, puts emphasis on this 
activity of explanatory guessing. Interesting illustrations 
are given as to the value this phase has had in the develop- 
ment of science. 
d. Develop a cautious, critical attitude when the problem 
seems on the road to solution. Teach pupils the importance 
of suspending judgment, of maintaining an attitude of open- 
mindedness. This is important if we are to keep scientific 
thinking or creative thought from stagnating into “ration- 
alizing.” An apparently acceptable solution on a limited 
amount of data, when too readily accepted as final, is the 
source of most prejudices, which are, as the word implies, 
premature judgments held as final solutions. 
e. Compare solutions with the conclusions of others on the 
same question. 'The problem method can be made a helpful 
method of motivating worth-while reading. Much of the 
explanatory, scientific, critical, and philosophical literature 
is closed to us because we have never confronted the pro- 
blems they deal with, or have never attempted an independ- 
ent solution, or even advanced a guess. If we have, we are 
interested in reading the discussions that relate to such 
problems. This activity is, of course, limited in its possibili- 
ties for immature pupils. Teachers, though, should be ac- 
quainted with some such literature affecting their subjects, 
and, in giving references, should keep them in reserve until 
some independent solution has been offered. The point is 
easily illustrated in questions in civics or in current events. 
After the class has arrived at a solution, and knows the 
reasons for that solution, present some speech or writing by 
a leader who has arrived at a different answer. 
Problems and projects may be for group or individuals. 
It has already been shown (page 154), that any individual 
exercise is not necessarily a project. The reverse is also true,
-P-A-G-E-183
SR RR eR ke Re ERY OS a SOREN PC Tee et es 
PROJECT AND PROBLEM METHODS 169 
and this applies to all the planes on which problem-solving 
may be undertaken. In agriculture and home economics 
work, one of the earliest fields in which true project work 
was developed, under the direction of the Federal Board for 
Vocational Education, considerable use was made of the 
“home-project” work. This was necessarily individual, 
and in the literature of the Federal Board we have several 
important bulletins dealing with the organization, super- 
vision, and reporting of such individual home projects.!_ In 
a similar way individual pupils may be assigned problems 
for mental or symbolical solution, as well as for real solu- 
tion, in the schoolroom. 
On the other hand, in any form of problem-solving, the 
class may work as a group. The whole group may take up 
the solution of the whole problem, if it is a mental one; or all 
individuals in the group may work at the whole problem 
simultaneously, and possibly competitively : or the problem, 
if it is an ambitious one, may, after some preliminary group 
work, be split up into minor units of study or construction, 
so that the group is working forward to a solution codper- 
atively. Some experience in each of these forms is advisable. 
The project lesson plan. The formal organization of a 
lesson plan was shown to be helpful and almost necessary in 
connection with the inductive development method. The 
same is true for the derived problem and project lessons. 
The general outline that is advisable for the problem method 
has already been given (page 165). 
For the project method plan some valuable suggestions 
are found in the Federal Board Bulletin on The Home 
Project, mentioned in the footnote below. The following is 
found on page 12 of this bulletin:

  IL. Name of project. 
III. Why have you chosen this project? 
IV. After conferring with both your teacher and your mother, 
write a plan of the work you expect to do, listing: 
(1) What you expect to accomplish. 
(2) What you must know to accomplish this. 
(3) What you must do to complete your project. 
(4) What books and bulletins will help you. 
Another helpful suggestion comes to us from the fact that 
the project involves a problem, a question about which there 
is uncertainty or doubt that has to be solved. Refer back 
to page 165, and examine the essential steps in problem- 
solving. 
If we adapt the pupil’s plan above to the teacher’s pur- 
poses, and combine this with the problem-solving steps, we 
would have a lesson plan somewhat as follows: 
1. Statement of problem involved, preferably in question form. 
2. Direct class or individual pupil to suggest hypotheses, or 
guesses as to lines of solution. 
8. From this preliminary discussion have pupil draw up a plan, 
stating: 
(1) What he must know or try to find out. 
(2) What he must do to test his suggested solution. 
4. Require pupil to keep an outline record of what knowledge 
was sought and obtained. 
(1) The record of what he does will be in material form. 
5. See that a definite account is given of solution reached and of 
principles or processes learned incidentally. 
The last item in the lesson plan suggests that the “pur- 
posefulness” of a project activity must be educational, and 
that these values must be carefully conserved. We cannot 
take the educative values for granted as an incidental or by-

product of the activity. Neither can we let school work go 
as the mere activity itself, nor may we be satisfied with the 
mere resulting product itself. There must be testing for 
knowledge and technique learned in the processes.

The meaning of “appreciation.” Perhaps there is no type 
of school work that has suffered so greatly from being sub- 
jected to formalizing exercises as the lesson in appreciation. 
Appreciation involves three important phases of mental 
attitude — enjoyment, admiration, and sympathy. It is 
obvious, therefore, that its chief appeal is to the feelings or 
emotions. These feelings accompany, or are aroused by, 
excellence or perfection; or by some large degree of superi- 
ority in execution which inspires us so that the mental ex- 
perience is agreeable and satisfying. The fields in which 
such feelings are most commonly aroused are the arts, na- 
ture, truth, and conduct. The basis or center around which 
the feeling plays is some concept or idea. 
Out of these relationships we realize that appreciation 
may be stimulated by things intellectual, esthetic, or ethical. 
These fields correspond to such school subjects as literature, 
music, drawing and painting, the study of art objects, or
-P-A-G-E-190
  176 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
construction work of various kinds with various materials. 
Since practically all of these subjects but one, literature, 
play such a small part in school life, and since literature 
plays such a very large part, perhaps it will be best to confine 
the explanation and illustration of the appreciation lesson 
largely to this subject, with an occasional reference to other 
subjects if it seems to suggest itself. 
Formalism in appreciation lessons. Against the back- 
ground of the definition given we may return to the opening 
statement that the appreciation lessons have suffered from 
formalism. This formalism in the study of literature may be 
accounted for as being due to two causes. The first of these 
is the effort to cast the appreciation lesson into the mold of 
the inductive development lesson; the other is the incubus 
of the college-entrance requirements, with their insistence 
on factual information about the classics and undue em- 
phasis on technique. Both these formalistic influences are 
rapidly passing. Experience has shown that the inductive 
plan can have only the most general suggestions for the ap- 
preciation lesson. 
Teachers of English in high schools, and principals and 
superintendents, have organized an opposition to college 
domination of the literature courses that has been effective 
in establishing a large degree of freedom. If English in the 
high school, and even in the elementary schools, still has too 
large an element of the scholastic and preparatory, this is 
due largely to the fact that the classics used are still the kind 
edited by the college specialists, with their introductions, 
footnotes, and glossaries of the preparatory type; or to the 
fact that teachers of English, having been trained in the 
university method, are naturally modifying their technique 
only gradually as they come to realize the real needs and 
social values possible in the study of literature from a more 
vital point of view. This grows out of a recognition that
-P-A-G-E-191
THE APPRECIATION LESSON 177 
only a very small percentage of high-school students will 
need the preparation for college English. 
AssicNMENT: Find one or two articles, in the early numbers 
of The English Journal, which discuss the subject of college- 
entrance requirements in English. Prepare a brief report for 
the class. 
To what is “appreciation” applicable? The appreciation 
lesson may be directed at different elements in a piece of 
literature. Sometimes emphasis will be put on one, some- 
times on another, often on several, or even all of these ele- 
ments. What is to be selected for an appeal to the feelings 
of enjoyment, sympathy, and admiration will be determined 
partly by the nature of the classic itself, and partly by the 
level of development of the pupils. These elements may 
be grouped in three pairs, all of which involve every sort 
of reciprocal combination. Appreciation lessons may be 
directed toward: 
a. Thought or Feeling. 
b. Content or Form. 
c. Wholes or Details. 
The reciprocal relations involved in these elements call 
for some explanation and illustration. In the reading of 
some classics we are conscious that their greatness lies in the 
thought stimulated. This stimulation may come not merely 
from the thought content — its truthfulness, its profundity, 
its usefulness; it may arise from the form in which it is ex- 
pressed — its cleverness, its clearness, its force, its scope, 
its skillful massing of details. This appeal may lie in the 
piece as a whole; in its central theme or keynote; or it may 
rise to such levels only now and then, in certain masterful 
paragraphs or stanzas, or even in single lines or sentences 
that have lived as universally-acceptable truths like pro- 
verbs or adages. 
An illustration from the study of Julius Cesar. In
-P-A-G-E-192
  178 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Shakespeare’s Julius Cesar, for example, the thought of 
the play as a whole has been shown by historical research to 
be far from the truth; the political situation at Rome was 
not at all understood as scholarship now understands it; 
neither Cesar nor Brutus is given a proper interpretation. 
To appreciate this the thought-content as a whole must be 
compared with corrective scholarly accounts of the closing 
days of the Roman republic. We have here a type of work 
that is clearly beyond the average upper-grade or lower- 
high-school level where the play is usually studied. Yet 
there are details in the thought-content that can be brought 
out for their values of truthfulness — the envy of Cassius 
and the duplicity and power of Mark Anthony, or the fickle- 
ness of the Roman mob and the superstition of the age. 
In the same way we could take up the thought-form, either 
as a whole or in detail. The general structure of the play, 
the masterful development of the theme to its turning-point, 
and the progress of the resolution to the tragic climax — in 
short, the whole conventional study of the dramatic tech- 
nique as made classic by Freytag ' and Miss Woodbridge.? 
Again we have in this study of the thought-form as a whole a 
more proper subject for study in university classes in dra- 
matic technique than for the grade and high-school students. 
Nor is it easy to find form “details” that would be suitable 
for such students; perhaps the general development of the 
“rising” and “falling” of the action might be even more 
“teachable” from the point of view of appreciation of dra- 
matic skill than the details of the technique. 
The feelings and emotions in appreciation lessons. In 
the general field of feeling or emotions we may likewise direct 
the pupil’s attention to the phases of content and form, as 
seen in the whole of a masterpiece or in selected details.

-P-A-G-E-193
  THE APPRECIATION LESSON 179 
Sympathy or its opposite may be aroused with the emo- 
tional spirit or atmosphere of a poem as a whole, with the 
portrayal of the emotional life of a character in its complete- 
ness, or with occasional or temporary, or even varied feel- 
ings, in particular passages. Or, on the other hand, there 
may be an appeal to the artistic sense, the admiration 
aroused by the beauty of form, the rhythm, and the musical- 
ness of the piece; sometimes as a whole, more commonly in 
specific parts. In connection with the whole matter of ap- 
preciative feeling we must not lose sight of the fact that the 
thought side can hardly be absent; feeling must have ideas 
or concepts to attach itself to. Occasionally such emotional 
reactions may be prompted by elements too subtle or elusive 
to be tangible or expressible in “ideas”; but the intellectual 
side is more commonly prominent enough to be analyzed and 
communicated. 
The element of appreciation comes in in all such experi- 
ences in that the concepts, sympathies, admirations, or even 
the disapproval or repulsion of the thoughts or feelings con- 
templated, give us a feeling of pleasure or enjoyment be- 
cause of the reality, intensity, cleverness, and sincerity with 
which the portrayal is made. 
These emotional relationships may again be illustrated 
from Julius Cesar. We may know Shakespeare’s por- 
trayal of Brutus is unhistorical but we cannot elude his art; 
we sympathize with the aristocratic reactionary as if he 
were a self-sacrificing patriot. Or we feel the cleverness of 
Mark Anthony’s funeral oration as fitting the speaker and 
the occasion, or we rejoice at his well-chosen tribute to dead 
Brutus — “This was the noblest Roman of them all.” 
Assignment: Illustrate the principles discussed under the topic 
“To What Is ‘Appreciation’ Applicable?” by showing how 
they would apply in some other English classic with which 
you are familiar, ;
-P-A-G-E-194
  180 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Appreciation and criticism. In the thought that enjoy- 
ment, induced by intellectual, esthetic, or ethical stimula- 
tions, is the chief aim of the appreciation lesson, we recog- 
nize the distinction that has been made between the liter- 
ature of information and the literature of inspiration, of 
knowledge, and of power. It is the province of the appreci- 
ation lesson to do for the student what, principally, the lit- 
erary critic does for his readers. In this connection there is 
a valuable suggestion in the canons of criticism laid down 
by Coleridge, who was as great a literary critic as he was 
poet. He suggested the application of these three questions 
to any piece of literature: 
(1) What has the author tried to do? 
(2) Was it worth doing? 
(3) Did he do it well? 
Two sorts of literary criticism may be distinguished — 
the practical and the artistic. 
Literary criticism is largely that type of book-reviewing 
which deals with books of the informational class, in which 
the above canons are applied for the purpose of giving the 
reader an idea whether a particular book will have any 
practical value for him, and whether there is any “use” in 
reading it. 
Artistic criticism deals with that type of literature which 
is written solely for purposes of the reader’s enjoyment, 
amusement, recreation, or inspiration. Varying degrees of 
values of this sort determine the literary merit of the work. 
Criticism of the highest type is intended as an inspiration 
in itself; it is appreciation sensed by the keenest intellect, 
the most sensitive feelings and sympathies, and expressed in 
terms that are themselves an inspiration. Criticism of this 
lofty type usually devotes its efforts to worthy materials, 
and largely labors to stimulate appreciation or approval of
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE APPRECIATION LESSON 181 
exceptional merits. Some of the criticism may be negative, 
and in this phase of their work literary critics often con- 
tribute valuable constructive theories or interpretations of 
thought and life. 
In our school work our selection of literature is largely 
confined to the worthy, and our appreciation lesson, there- 
fore, must chiefly deal with the positive side. We must do 
for our pupils, in a simple way, what the critic does for the 
adult reader — inspire an appreciation, admiration, and 
sympathy that will fashion an attitude of pleasant enjoy- 
ment of the thoughts and feelings portrayed, and, to a rather 
limited degree in public school work, an enjoyment of the 
form in which such thoughts and feelings are made effective. 
The aim of appreciation lessons. In a more definite form, 
what shall we aim at in appreciation lessons? What are the 
objectives of our study of literary masterpieces in school? 
Are they not, in general, — 
(1) To get pupils to love good books; 
(2) To value and enjoy high and noble thoughts; 
(8) To understand and sympathize with human nature; and 
(4) To realize the variety and possible intensity of life? 
These may be consciously aimed at in varying degrees of 
the general and the specific in any piece of literature. We 
may be aiming to arouse a love of Dickens for some of his 
characteristic values. We may be striving to expose the pu- 
pil to the rollicking humor and the spirit of good-fellowship 
in Pickwick Papers. We may try to develop a conception of 
the eccentric good-nature of a Sam Weller, as a person we 
would have enjoyed knowing. We may enter into the rare 
humor of a single incident of his life, such as the writing of 
the “walentine.’’ Or we may get to wish we could hear that 
worthy’s father calling him ‘“‘Samivel” for just once. 
AssIGNMENT: Find other statements of the aims of appreciation 
lessons, in any of the general teachers’ manuals that deal with
-P-A-G-E-196
  182 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
The Teaching of English, such as Carpenter, Baker and Scott’s, 
Chubb’s, Bolenius, Thomas, Ward, and others. 
(The teacher of English in the junior or senior high school, 
and the teacher of language and literature in the elementary 
schools, should have a general acquaintance with all such man. 
uals for reference purposes.) 
The method of the appreciation lesson. Many of such 
enjoyments would best be a casual “touch-and-go” affair, as 
it is between two friends in expressions of common appre- 
ciations. To formalize the work, to make too serious a task 
of it, is to reflect on the ability of the author to inspire such 
thoughts and feelings or the ability of the pupil to react if 
he is just naturally exposed. And this fault of over-teaching, 
of making a task of what should be a pleasure, is often ac- 
counted for by the vice of trying to have the immature 
grasp and appreciate all those things the adult easily sees, 
forgetting that in most of the classics the writer had the 
adult audience in mind. 
Much of this guidance in appreciation must be a mere 
matter of contagion. If you yourself clearly see the beauties 
and keenly feel the inspiration, you will communicate it in 
simple, natural enthusiasms that will be accepted in sincer- 
ity by your pupils. If the inspiration is merely the infor- 
mation that it is there, if your analysis or insight is merely 
the affected echo of pedantry, or if you are merely assuming 
a pose for academic or business purposes, you are no “car- 
rier” of the contagion. Your pupils will not catch what you 
do not have. 
The fact that this matter of teaching appreciation is an 
informal “touch-and-go” affair, a subtle contagion, does not 
necessarily imply that school treatment of the classics may 
not be approached systematically, with a consciousness of a 
technique that will set a background for the best communi 
cation of appreciations. The fact that you are trying to
-P-A-G-E-197
  THE APPRECIATION LESSON 183 
avoid the formality that may descend to stupid mechanism, 
or that may be governed by unnatural academic motives, 
does not involve the necessity of discussing a classic in a 
random, haphazard way, trusting to the spur of the moment, 
entering the class period without systematic preparation on 
the part of either pupils or teacher. The appreciative critic 
goes about his work as systematically as a creative artist 
blocks out his novel or his poem. 
Plan for the development of appreciative enjoyment. 
The analysis above of the objects of appreciation in a liter- 
ary masterpiece may give us our plan for the outlining of 
how to develop appreciative enjoyment. This will take into 
consideration the pairing of thought and feeling, of content 
and form, while the relative values of the “whole vs. detail” 
pair will be disposed of incidentally. This will give us three 
main topics for the further discussion of how to develop en- 
joyment of the values in literature: 
(1) How to Develop Appreciation of Thought. 
(2) How to Develop Appreciation of Feeling. 
(3) How to Develop Appreciation of Technique. 
These three topics will form the three main divisions of the 
remainder of this chapter. 
1. How to develop appreciation of thought 
Analysis for larger units and organization. There are two 
ways to achieve this — rapid silent reading, or slow, labo- 
rious outlining or briefing. The former is the natural way; 
the latter, the common academic way. The possibilities in 
rapid silent reading, and in skimming, are just beginning to 
be discovered in school work. Scattered experiments with 
pupils, ranging all the way from primary grades through 
upper university classes, have shown wonderful possibilities 
for individual improvement in rate of reading, even for very
-P-A-G-E-198
184 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
fast readers; and the experiments have likewise shown that 
this type of study pays equal, if not superior, returns over 
outlining as a method of getting the gist or general drift of a 
selection. This has already been discussed quite fully in the 
chapters on textbooks (I) and on collateral reading (II). 
To substitute for this first natural reading the outlining 
method, for the sake of having something tangible to grade 
the pupil on, may have some advantages, but it surely has 
two decided disadvantages: 
(1) The reading of the classic is at once put into the class of 
academic exercises, and a natural prejudice against it is not 
the proper attitude to put pupils in at the outset of the study. 
(2) There is the further disadvantage of having the pupils feel 
that the work is going to be difficult to understand, which is 
an additional discounting of its probable interest. 
The natural questions follow: “Are pupils then only to 
read such classics as are interesting to them?” “Are they 
not to be ‘put through’ the great worth-while standard 
things by any means?” “‘Do we not have to form their taste 
for these great books?” Such questions show a lack of con- 
fidence in the particular classics to be studied, which is often 
warranted, but they also show a lack of faith in the pupils. 
Worst of all, they show a misconception, altogether too com- 
mon, of the aim of the work in literature. Beyond a doubt 
the chief aim is to arouse an interest in the authors studied, 
in the worthy types of literature that are presented, and this 
can never be done by making the samples studied uninter- 
esting or distasteful. More harm than good will result fron 
such a program. 
Handling the first rapid reading. If the piece of literature 
being studied is at all extensive, this method of the first 
natural reading presents some difficulties. We must know 
that all pupils are covering the ground, and that they will all 
have completed the first reading by the time it is necessary
-P-A-G-E-199
  
THE APPRECIATION LESSON 185 
for the class to go on with further study of it along other 
lines. The teacher must estimate carefully how many pages 
of the book may reasonably be assigned each day. Let us 
suppose that the book is a novel, and that pupils may rea- 
sonably be expected to give an hour to preparation. A min- 
imum assignment of from thirty to fifty pages a day, with 
due regard for natural chapter divisions, may be made. 
This will depend somewhat on the character of the book and 
the advancement of the class. 
At the beginning of the class period a brief test of five or 
ten minutes may be given, on the model of some of the de- 
vices shown in Chapter XI, for example, a right and wrong 
test. This need be just enough of a test to show pupils they 
are to be held to account for the assigned reading. The test 
must be general and superficial enough to make a good grade 
possible for the single reading. There must be a frank, clear 
understanding of the nature and purpose of the test between 
teacher and pupils, and the spirit of it must be fairly main- 
tained. The class period may then be devoted to a discus- 
sion of such questions as will clarify the situation, make im- 
portant characters stand out, anything that will promote a 
clearer understanding of what is to follow without in any 
way transgressing on the sequel still to be read. If pupils 
are allowed leeway in reading, as often seems desirable, care 
must be taken that they do not “divulge” anything that 
may take off the edge of the interest for those who are pro- 
ceeding at the minimum rate. 
In this connection it must also be emphasized that this 
first exposure to the classic should in nearly every case be 
the first work that is done. This must precede any “intro- 
ductions” that may be found in the school editions. Could 
anything be more stupidly calculated to destroy the charm 
of surprise in The Lady of the Lake than to have half the 
class discover, before they have started to read the poem
-P-A-G-E-200
  186 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
itself, that James Fitz-James is the King of Scotland? Yet 
school editions of the poem which reveal this in the “Intro- 
duction” are not hard to find. 
Some of the discussion in the class period in connection 
with the first reading may be given to the gradual building- 
up of the main outline of the piece. Beyond this the time 
may be taken up by work on any of the detailed passages for 
thought and feeling, by methods to be explained presently. 
In connection with this first reading for the general 
thought and organization, one further suggestion must be 
made. If some degree of outlining is thought to be necessary 
and helpful, great care must be taken not to make such out- 
lining too detailed. This has been referred to previously, in 
another connection. Even with high-school classes, compli- 
cated degrees of codrdination and subordination are a futil- 
ity and defeat their own purpose. The detailed briefing of 
Burke’s Speech on Conciliation, with the consequent dislike 
universally entertained of this great oration, is fast becoming 
a standard example among progressive English teachers of 
“how not to do it.” 
Give a few stimulating questions, especially intended to 
bring out the theme or the keynote of the selection. This 
method is perhaps more suitable in dealing with shorter 
selections that can be read in a single or a few preparation 
periods. It is especially appropriate for the brief lyrics or 
for the short narrative poems, such as The Vision of Sir 
Launfal or the poems of Longfellow usually found in the 
course of study. 
Individual discoveries and difficulties. Secure, in the 
class period, volunteer expressions of individual discoveries, 
or of individual difficulties. It is very hard for an adult to 
get the immature pupil’s point of view unless an opportunity 
is given for the expression of it. Such difficulties cannot be 
anticipated except by the experienced teacher, but a begin-
-P-A-G-E-201
THE APPRECIATION LESSON 187 
ning toward building up this understanding cannot be made 
too soon, nor can it be followed up too systematically or 
persistently. 
Much of the standard literature we study in the schools 
has this value of stimulating thought or of inspiring por- 
trayal of life as its chief reason for permanence. Some of 
this is too profound for any but adult appreciation, but some 
has the simplicity and universality which appeals to the child 
as well. This appeal must be sounded to be known, and vol- 
untary expression of it must be encouraged by all means. 
The teacher who deals with “classics” effectively and with 
interest soon gets to feel he is a sort of “‘ Professor of Things- 
in-General,” and that all phases of life are his to deal with 
in his guidance of the growing mind. 
Rarely impart or reveal elements for appreciation. If 
pupils cannot be led to make discoveries for themselves, the 
chance of their enjoying such elements is slight. This may 
often strike the teacher as esthetic blindness, but it may 
safely be assumed to be the blindness of immaturity. There 
is too much danger of overloading a child’s capacity for ap- 
preciation by adult subtleties and sublimities, elusive charm 
and cleverness. This well-meaning attempt to serve all one’s 
bounty will create either mental indigestion or a suspicion 
that the teacher’s enthusiasms are not genuine. What the 
pupil himself does not naturally see, he will put down as 
affectation, insistence will be stamped as pretense, and the 
more fervently it is put, the more hypocritical will it be 
judged. 
Have some noble thoughts memorized. The most puz- 
zling problem in this connection is whether those passages 
not fully comprehended by children should be memorized. 
Much might be said pro and con. The position is here taken 
that memorizing of such material, to a limited extent, is 
justified, because of its probably permanent values as an in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  188 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
spiring asset. Only, two cautions should be noted. This 
type of work should not be overdone, and it should not be 
made burdensome in quantity. Moreover, the memoriza- 
tion should not be undertaken before a thorough effort has 
been made to create the fullest understanding possible. If 
the passage is too profound or subtle to make some success 
of a class period of discussion and explanation, the material 
should probably not be memorized. Complete realization 
of all the truth involved need not be attained; more will 
come in the memorization itself, and full significance of val- 
ued passages have dawned on us only after intense experi- 
ences in later years. And who has not valued the possession 
of some inspiring lines hitherto imperfectly understood? A 
single verse of Scripture or of some noble poem has served 
more varied uses, if it was at immediate and complete com- 
mand, than a related volume. 
AssignmMENT: Let each member of the class find a statement or 
argument, pro or con, on the question of Memorizing in School 
Work. 
2. How to develop appreciation of feeling 
Three avenues of appeal to the feelings and emotions. In 
addition to the appreciative enjoyment of clear, subtle, 
noble, inspiring thought, there is large scope, and perhaps 
still larger scope, for the pleasant exercise of the feelings and 
emotions in the reading and study of literature. There are 
three avenues of appeal connected with the better class of 
literature. 
(1) There is, first the appeal to the esthetic or artistic sense, in the 
form or technique, in such matters as style, meter, rhythm, 
choice of musical word or phrase, form of construction, and 
the like. 
(2) Another phase of enjoyment comes in connection with the 
ideas suggested, the descriptions of nature or people, any- 
thing that is set before the mind’s eye objectively that arouses
-P-A-G-E-203
THE APPRECIATION LESSON 189 
sensations or associations with a strong affective accompani- 
ment. 
(8) Third, there is the vicarious sympathy we enter into in the 
feelings or emotions of persons or characters in the piece. 
This might be termed imaginative or dramatic feeling ap- 
preciation. 
The two latter are often so closely related and the ap- 
proach is so similar that these may be treated together as 
far as teaching effort is concerned. The esthetic phase of 
technique appreciation will be taken up separately. Some 
direct suggestions of approach in connection with the ob- 
jective or dramatic phases of feeling will be given first. 
Stimulate by visualization. Plan a careful selection of 
elements for visualization, or stimulation of the imagina- 
tion. My own earliest recollection of “induced apprecia- 
tion” was on the suggestion of the instructor to picture 
what sort of image Milton must have had in mind when he 
wrote the line in L’ Allegro: 
And Laughter holding both his sides. 
It was a flashing human contrast to the Milton of stern 
patriotism and of solemn theology that had been described 
for us in the History of English Literature that had been 
studied before. It led to a reading on a wider scale about 
his career at Cambridge, and the golden years of his youth at 
Horton. 
There is the widest field of choice for such material in 
every poem and novel, every essay and play, sometimes in 
rich masses of description, sometimes in tense scenes of ac- 
tion, sometimes in the whole career of well-drawn characters, 
oftener in single words or lines. The suggested visualiza- 
tions may be scattered with a lavish hand — some will fall 
on stony places, some among thorns, but some will fall on 
fertile ground. The teacher of English literature need not 
be surprised at the display of all manner of individual “‘ap-  
-P-A-G-E-204
  190 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
perceptive bases.” Youth has been charmed with massed 
detail where the adult is often bored. The opening section 
of Ben-Hur, or the ornate imagery of the early descriptions 
in The Talisman will sometimes provoke an adolescent en- 
joyment that rebukes the adult judgment of suggestions to 
skip or skim. 
Ethical values. Search for ethical values, and do not hes- 
itate to provoke discussions about them. These are found 
in the themes or “purposes” of much that appears in the 
course in literature, and there is an even richer field in the 
informal analysis and discussion of characters. Much of 
the study of literature in the public schools comes at a stage 
when ardent judgments of right and wrong in conduct are 
easily aroused. 
Do not tell pupils what to feel. Get the pupils to feel; do 
not tell them what to feel. The danger of “gushing” over 
our own discoveries, our own feelings, is even more damaging 
to our purposes than in connection with the appreciation of 
thought. The tendencies to contempt, or insincerity, are 
even more harmful here. The teacher should have the grace 
and good judgment to respect the tastes of his pupils, even 
their courage to deny they are “charmed” by a particular 
classic, or a particular passage, especially if they are willing 
to advance explanations of dislike. 
Literary criticism is full of individuality; rival tastes do 
not necessarily imply that one side or the other is lacking in 
taste. An appreciation of the realism in the literature of 
to-day may seem preposterous to some; but such “conserva- 
tives” can hardly read the most reliable and respected critics 
without feeling that somehow they have drifted out of the 
current of literary progress. Try sometime to demonstrate 
to a boy the real superiority of Treasure Island or Captains 
Courageous over any common “thriller” in a current story 
magazine.
-P-A-G-E-205
  THE APPRECIATION LESSON 191 
Suggestive questions. Plan your assignments to make 
pupils find beauties. Stimulating the search is the limit of 
our duty; the discovery must be left to the pupil. But an 
occasional gem found is more valuable than a displayed 
hoard. The most feasible method seems to be the suggestive 
question. The collections of available materials are numer- 
ous. The various editions of the classics often contain such 
lists of valuable questions. Several publishers have issued 
Manuals! covering the whole range of their editions. 
Teachers of English have written similar Manuals.” 
With all of this paraphernalia of devices the teacher of 
reading and literature should make herself familiar. A 
selective composite will yield an embarrassment of mate- 
rial. There is probably a greater danger of overdoing this in 
a mechanical way than of failing to find a sufficiency of ma- 
terial for such exercises. The collection and comparison of 
such question lists will in itself be a wholesome revelation to 
the teacher in two directions. She will be surprised at how 
many and what different elements are found by various 
editors and authors; and she will be astonished to find ques- 
tions that confront her in baffling rebuke, “What in the 
world is that question driving at?” Perhaps it is some 
chance misprint; perhaps a revelation of some “blind spot” 
in our own taste. Let us be as charitable to our pupils as we 
are to ourselves in such a dilemma. 
Reading aloud. Read aloud to your class impressively, 
avoiding affectation. Every teacher of literature should be

required to take at least one course in “Expression”; and 
perhaps no more. The best way to communicate the con- 
tagion of feeling is to try to interpret the author to the class. 
Much of poetry should be heard, as well as read. Some- 
times good readers in the class may be entrusted with the 
task, but never should the halting “oral-reading-class” ex- 
ercise of the primary days be allowed to jeopardize the val- 
ues of the appreciation period. If pupils are to read, it should 
be on prepared parts, and then only if a tradition of inter- 
pretative expression has been built up. 
Memorize selected portions. The values and limitations 
of memorizing thought passages were discussed in a preced- 
ing section (page 187). The point of view applies similarly 
to passages rich in feeling content. 
However, in this connection, the value of presenting 
worthy drama that has been memorized may be touched 
upon. The reading dramatization is a hazardous under- 
taking, apt to degenerate into a stumbling, mechanical 
exercise, but if the labor of memorizing can be motivated, 
say by public presentation, there is no more effective way to 
get a real appreciative sympathy with the action and the 
characterization. Even a Shakespearean play is not too 
ambitious an undertaking for high-school freshmen. Some 
of the longer leading parts can often be conveniently divided 
among several actors. As You Like It, with two Rosalinds 
and two Celias, will give no one a part of more than 275 
lines. The staging and costuming can all be undertaken by 
the pupils themselves, and in a most effective way. Give 
each character a free rein to develop his part, and, as he 
learns his lines, he will reveal an appreciation that will win 
real applause. The whole affair —a real project, by the 
way, if it gets a real audience presentation — need not con- 
sume more than the five or six weeks that are usually devoted 
to the academic “frazzling” of a play in class study.

THE APPRECIATION LESSON 193 
Find the “human interest” elements. Some interesting 
analyses have recently been attempted of the motives that 
dominate children’s reading in the upper grades and in high 
school. In one such study, an unpublished master’s thesis 
at the University of Illinois, pupil questionnaires were used 
to find the weight of various elements of interest in a list of 
books popular with boys and girls. The list of books com- 
prised the following thirty books: 
Call of the Wild Shepherd of the Hills 
Treasure Island Robinson Crusoe 
Tom Sawyer Lorna Doone 
Ivanhoe Little Women 
Kidnapped Pollyanna 
Huckleberry Finn Girl of the Limberlost 
Tale of Two Cities Eyes of the World 
When a Man’s a Man Laddie 
White Fang Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm 
Freckles David Copperfield 
Penrod Trail of the Lonesome Pine 
Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come Harvester 
Sherlock Holmes Seventeen 
Swiss Family Robinson Secret Garden 
Lady of the Lake Promised Land 
The elements investigated in the questionnaire were 
these: 
REASONS WHY YOU ENJOYED EACH BOOK 
. Because of the mystery in it. 
. Because of stirring adventure. 
. Because of the boy hero. 
. Because of the girl heroine. 
. Because the principal boy or girl character was like real boys 
or girls you know. 
. Because the principal boy or girl character was unlike the real 
boys or girls you know. 
7. Because of the descriptions of places or persons. 
8. Because it dealt with life on the sea, or Be 09 2 ee o

9. Because of the humor. 
10. Because it dealt with persons or events in history. 
11. Because it dealt with animals. 
12. Because story involved success, especially in gaining money. 
13. Because it dealt with familiar scenes and life. 
14. Because it dealt with strange or novel scenes and life. 
15. Because it appealed to sentiment or emotion. 
Dwell on the heroic in action and character. This is 
evidently justified from two motives. Heroism is one of 
our most potent channels of interest, and it is through this 
indirect means that the most effective ethical inspiration 
comes to adolescence. 
AssIGNMENT: Illustrate, in some detail, how you would apply the 
principles stated in this section on “How to Develop Appre- 
ciation of Feeling” in connection with some particular classic. 
Let each member of the class select a poem or story independ- 
ently for this assignment. Have some of the papers read in 
class and the suggestions evaluated. 
3. The appreciation of technique 
Teaching technique. It has been intimated that only a 
very limited amount of emphasis on the technical, artistic 
side of literature is advisable, even in the high school. The 
reasons for this should be clearly understood. The em- 
phasis on technique in the study of the classics can be at- 
tributed to two causes: 
a. The demands of college preparatory requirements; 
b. The confusion of the two phases of the English teacher’s 
work — the teaching of literature and the teaching of com- 
position — and the natural effort to codrdinate the two. 
The importance of college requirements as a factor in the 
study of literature may be considered by raising the follow- 
ing questions: “Is the teaching of literature in the public 
schools a question of training consumers, or producers; of  
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE APPRECIATION LESSON 195 
developing understanding, or skill; of bringing out taste, or 
talent.” 
University instruction in English. Even university 
courses in literature and composition may be judged by 
these criteria, and found wanting. The average university 
course in composition may be taken as an illustration. Two 
types of work are usually prominent, the compulsory 
“Freshman-English” course, and a variety of upper-class 
elective courses in story-writing, play-writing, and novel- 
writing. Very little opportunity is given for developing a 
practical, usable form of exposition, which is becoming more 
and more necessary for the business man and for men in al- 
most every profession. The course in journalism is the only 
effort recently introduced to supply such needs, and these 
courses usually have a too highly specialized point of view to 
be attractive as electives to the medical or law student as a 
means of giving him a helpful training in practical everyday 
expression. The sorrows of graduate students struggling 
with the organization and writing of a thesis are too com- 
mon, and the product often too pitiful to deny the criticism 
is fair. 
Moreover, the compulsory “Freshman-English” course is 
too often a pious hypocrisy. Universities lament the un- 
preparedness of entering students, and then pretend to make 
good all their shortcomings in a single year of work under a 
host of untrained graduate students, fellows, and assistants, 
who have had no teaching experience, and who are often 
little more than theme-readers. To them is entrusted the 
miraculous transformation of the unprepared Freshman, who 
seems to have profited so little under the instruction of three 
or four years with high-school teachers who are far better 
trained and certainly more experienced in their work than 
the average university instructor of “Freshman English.” 
After this first year the English department has little more
-P-A-G-E-210
  196 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
to offer, for the great majority, on the composition side. 
For the rest — the cream of the class, the English “majors” 
— the elective courses, intended to train literary producers, 
are open. Such courses are not out of place in a university; 
but opportunity for development of the others has certainly 
been neglected. 
The results as seen in the high school. Unfortunately the 
tradition of this type of composition work is also present in 
the high school. English teachers, turned out by the uni- 
versity process, in far greater number than literary produc- 
ers, and textbooks in composition mostly written by univer- 
sity specialists, both carry the method and the aim of devel- 
oping story-writers, poets, novelists, and dramatists into the 
composition work in the high school, and even the grades; 
and, because of their close codrdination, this is carried over 
to an unwise extent into the appreciation lesson. If the 
training of producers were the aim, the study of poetical 
technique, of dramatic technique, and of the short story and 
novel, as gained from masterpieces, would be a reasonable 
enough procedure, as it is followed in such university courses 
in play-wrighting and verse-smithing. 
But the high-school teacher’s chief function as a promoter 
of good literature is the developing of consumers, rather than 
producers. Only a very few in each of her classes will even 
get the chance for university training for production; only a 
fraction of one per cent will join the select group of produc- 
ers, or even of the dabblers at production. An emphasis on 
technique in the appreciation lesson in the public schools is 
largely out of place. Here the function of the study of lit- 
erature is the development of understanding, of enjoyment, 
of sympathy, of interests, and of admiration for the content, 
rather than of skill in the imitation or adaptation of form 
and technique. It is primarily and almost exclusively a 
question of developing good taste in all. This does not mean 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
    
THE APPRECIATION LESSON 197 
that a ready recognition and a generous encouragement is 
not to be given to talent as it may occasionally display itself. 
Nor does this involve a complete ignoring of technique. 
A little of such experience is worth while for all as a mere 
matter of culture. Even those who do not go to college 
should know the difference between a ballad and blank 
verse. They may also have some practical use for Scott’s 
uniform method of describing persons, or of Macaulay’s 
devices of paragraph construction. 
No formal plan of technique study is necessary. Occa- 
sional suggestive questions, thrown in with those relating to 
the appreciation of thought and feeling, or the discussion of 
questions relating to technique raised by the pupils, will 
give this element of literature adequate consideration. 
Using classics for ulterior purposes. A single further 
negative suggestion must be made with reference to the 
study of classic literature. The classics should not be used 
as material for exercises with motives other than apprecia- 
tive study and enjoyment. It is unfair to create a dislike 
for a poem because it offers convenient puzzling material 
for drill in parsing, diagramming, or outlining, or for illus- 
tration of rules and definitions in grammar, punctuation, 
and rhetoric. The relationship should rather be reversed. 
If analysis of a section or of a sentence, or the parsing of a 
word or phrase, will aid in the understanding or appreciation 
of a passage it should be used. We must be careful, though, 
to maintain the correct attitude in the pupils as to which is 
the means and which the end — literature does not exist for 
grammar’s sake, rather grammar and its allies for the sake 
of literature, in the interpretation as well as in the produc- 
tion.

The contribution of Pestalozzi to educational method. 
Modern educational theory begins with the publication of 
Rousseau’s Emile, in 1762. Rousseau himself was not a 
teacher, but rather a social theorist, and it remained for men 
inspired by the French philosopher to modify his theories 
and expand them into practical forms. The earliest, and 
probably the greatest of those whom Rousseau inspired was 
Pestalozzi, who clearly deserves the honor of being recog- 
nized as the founder of modern educational practice. 
Pestalozzi formulated a complete philosophy of educa- 
tion. This has been summarized in a few paragraphs by 
Cubberley in the following words: 
The development of man he believed to be organic, and to pro- 
ceed according to law. It was the work of the teacher to discover 
these laws of development and to assist nature in securing “a 
natural, symmetrical, and harmonious development” of all the 
“faculties” of the child. Real education must develop the child as 
a whole — mentally, physically, morally — and called for the 
1 Cubberley, E. P., Public Education in the United States, pages 264-65.  
-P-A-G-E-216
  202 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
training of the head and the hand and the heart. The only proper 
means for developing the powers of the child was use, and hence 
education must guide and stimulate self-activity, be based on in- 
tuition and exercise, and the sense impressions must be organized 
and directed. Education, too, if it is to follow the organic develop- 
ment of the child, must observe the proper progress of child devel- 
opment, and be graded, so that each step of the process shall grow 
out of the preceding and into the following stage. To accomplish 
these ends the training must be all-round and harmonious; much 
liberty must be allowed the child in learning; education must pro- 
ceed largely by doing instead of by words; the method of learning 
must be largely analytical; real objects and ideas must precede 
symbols and words; and finally the organization and correlation 
of what is learned must be looked after by the teacher. 
Still more, Pestalozzi possessed a deep and abiding faith, new at 
the time, in the power of education as a means of regenerating 
society.... 
Pestalozzi also resented the brutal discipline which for ages had 
characterized all school instruction, believed it by its very nature 
immoral, and tried to substitute for this a strict but loving disci- 
pline — a “thinking love,” he calls it. 
From the first paragraph of this extract let us select a part 
of one sentence for emphasis to show its special relation to 
our problem of method — “Education must proceed largely 
by doing instead of by words; the method of learning must 
be largely analytical; real objects and ideas must precede 
symbols and words.” The extract as a whole shows the 
problem of methods in its setting. 
In tracing the consequences of Pestalozzi’s new ideas, 
Dr. Cubberley makes the following estimate of the effects of 
this element of method: ! 
The introduction of the study of natural objects in place of 
words, and much talking about what was seen and studied instead 
of parrot-like reproductions of the words of a book, revolutionized 
both the methods and the subject-matter of instruction in the de- 
veloping elementary school. Observation and investigation tended 
1 Cubberley, E. P., Public Education in the United States, page 266.  
-P-A-G-E-217

THE LABORATORY METHOD 203 
to supersede mere memorizing; class discussion and thinking to 
supersede the reciting of the words of the book; thinking about 
what was being done to supersede routine learning; and class in- 
struction to supersede the wasteful individual teaching which had 
for so long characterized all school work. It meant the reorganiza- 
tion of the work of elementary education on a modern basis, with 
class organization and group instruction. ... Observation led to 
the development of elementary science study, and the study of 
home geography; talking about what was observed led to the study 
of language usage, as distinct from the older study of grammar; and 
counting and measuring led to the study of number, and hence to a 
new type of primary arithmetic. 4 
The principle of “observation.” The simple “object les- 
son” of Pestalozzi’s day and of its advocates in this country, 
beginning with the Oswego Movement in the middle of the 
last century,” has developed in so many ways in our teaching 
method that hardly a subject is taught without some of this 
element being prominent. The use of objects, globes, ex- 
hibits, pictures, the stereopticon, motion pictures, and, per- 
haps most prominent of all, the laboratory method and the 
field trips of science teaching, are all phases of the recogni- 
tion of the educational value of direct observation, contact 
with material realities, and objective study of processes and 
conditions. 
There are three psychological principles which are recog- 
nized as putting all of this type of study on a high plane. 
a. The superior vividness of reality as over against symbols. 
This involves the distinction between getting ideas through 
sense-impression, experience, and analysis on the one hand, 
1 How this Pestalozzian “‘method” developed and dominated the elemen- 
tary-school system of the United States in the fifties and sixties is shown in 
detail in the next chapter of Cubberley’s Public Education in the United 
States, especially on pages 294-811. 
2 For a good description of this, and its influence in shaping the develop- 
ing normal school, see Part II of Chapter X of Cubberley’s Public Educa- 
tion in the United States.

  204 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING ' 
and verbal definition or description, or by inference from 
verbal context on the other. The latter involves the neces- 
sity of visualization and imagination, and is hampered by 
the fact that the impression is gained in a roundabout way 
and is hardly ever as complete, exact, or economical. 
b. Impression through several senses is most effective. This 
was shown (page 82f.), in the discussion of the inductive- 
development method, to be one way in which concepts 
are built up. 
c. “Learning by doing.” This merely carries over the 
idea of observation to processes. Skills, habits, and tech- 
nique cannot be learned by reading about them. Not even 
observation of others will make one a swimmer or a juggler. 
Models for imitation may be helpful preliminaries, but we 
have to get the “feel” of the movements; we have to learn 
control and proper codrdination by practice. This is as true 
of mental activities as it is of motor acts. 
This implies that the method of learning, the technique of 
study, should be definitely analyzed out of a learning pro- 
cess, and be brought directly to the pupil’s consciousness as 
a method of work that can be generally applied, or that can 
be used in meeting a variety of mental problems. A number 
of such concepts of method, as, for example, outlining, skim- 
ming, use of indexes and tables of contents, and the art of 
definition, have already been referred to in other connections. 
AssIGNMENT: Select some particular topic in any school subject, 
suitable for a single lesson, and try to make an exhaustive list 
of all the “ object” teaching that could possibly be introduced 
in connection with it, if there were no limitations as to expense,

Which, if any, would you use if you were going to teach this

object teaching and observation, consider the purposes this

developed form of laboratory work, and the difficulties we 
encounter in using it. 
The mental-discipline conception. Science teachers often 
indulge in naively contradictory attitudes with reference to 
the theory of mental discipline. In arguing for a larger 
place for the sciences in the curriculum they have been 
among the leaders in the attack on the supposedly disciplin- 
ary values claimed by the defenders of traditional subjects. 
Then, in building up a constructive argument for the sci- 
ences, they have often assumed the validity of the theory 
they had derided. It is a rather common thing to find such 
science teachers commending laboratory work on the ground 
that it develops powers of observation, reasoning, induction, 
etc. This is unfortunate, for the argument could easily be 
validated if methods of science teaching were adapted to 
inculcate “concepts of method,” and if the argument were 
then modified so as to claim training in methods of observa- 
tion, analysis, induction, and the like. 
Real contacts to impress principles. A prime purpose of 
all object teaching, whether in the class-room, laboratory, or 
on excursions, is to clarify and impress principles by real 
contacts. Laws of physics, classifications in botany, and 
formule in chemistry may be learned by rote, or be par- 
tially understood from textbook descriptions, but a great 
advance in effectiveness of teaching is accomplished by 
actual contacts with specimens, materials, and apparatus. 
Such work can be made more effective still by relating ab- 
stract principles and laws to the observation of practical ap- 
plications of them. The motivation for the learning of the 
theoretical side of electricity by the study of the telephone, 
automobile ignition, and radio is beginning to be recognized 
and utilized by progressive teachers.
-P-A-G-E-220
  206 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
To stimulate interest by contact with realities. Some sub- 
jects are confined to reading activities, while others may 
make large use of the object and observation lesson, and of 
the appeal to the natural instincts of curiosity and con- 
structiveness to arouse the interests of pupils. An interest in 
science is one of the most valuable interests a student can 
carry away from high school or college. The allurement of 
discoveries and inventions, and of subjects that have to do 
with nature and man’s processes of production, is recognized 
as a possibility even for upper-grade pupils, and this ac- 
counts in large part for the growth of the general science 
movement in the grades. 
Although this motive of exposure and interest is promi- 
nent, it is not unmixed with the scholastic preparatory aim. 
It is the latter motive which has made general science the 
battle-ground of specialists, and is a retarding influence 
rather than a helpful one. To the extent that the “prepar- 
atory” aim wins out will the general science field suffer in 
the attractiveness of its appeal to the instincts prominent in 
the pre-adolescent age. High-school science itself has sac- 
rificed considerable of the interest-appeal to the preparatory 
objective, as, for example, in the case of the earlier emphasis 
on mathematics in physics. 
To learn the laboratory technique. This is an extension 
of the suggestion made on page 205. Aside from the values 
possible in transferable study technique, there is the method 
of working in each of the different sciences. Skill in manipu- 
lation of the compound microscope and the preparation of 
material for the slides in the biological sciences illustrate this 
phase. The setting-up of apparatus in physics and chem- 
istry experiments are similar examples of the development 
of certain skills. While this is not a prominent purpose, it 
has some value for those who are preparing for more ad- 
vanced work in the same science.
-P-A-G-E-221
  THE LABORATORY METHOD 207 
To teach the spirit of true observation and experimenta- 
tion; to develop the scientific attitude. This purpose of 
laboratory work has hardly been noticed in high school, and 
is often lacking even in university work. Questioning uni- 
versity classes in different institutions, for several years, has 
revealed the fact that very few advanced students, even 
science majors, had gained a true or worthy conception of 
the meaning of an “experiment.” A thorough search of 
scientific literature yielded very meagre results that could 
be used as references to give students of education an idea 
of what is meant by “scientific method.””! We have reached 
the point in a number of social studiés, notably sociology 
and education, where we are ready to lay aside a priori 
reasoning, and the vague empirical literature, for principles 
based on research that follows the same rigid “scientific 
method” that has been developed in the natural and physi- 
cal sciences. 
There are certain fundamental principles of practice in 
scientific observation and experimentation that should be 
“generalized” out of laboratory experiences, so that they 
may be applied in these other fields. The common miscon- 
ception of college students as to the real significance of an 
experiment is amusing. To most of them, as far as they are 
able to express it, it means following the directions of a Man- 
ual, or working out a formula to agree with a principle pre- 
viously learned in a textbook. In short, it is rare to find a 
student who does not think of “experimenting” as synon- 
ymous with “an illustration of principles by the use of real 
materials.” No fault need be found if -much of the science 
laboratory work serves this purpose, but if it ends there it 
falls far short of its possibilities. Science students should not 
be surprised to learn that the genius of true experimenta-

Physics, published by The Macmillan Company, 1922.
-P-A-G-E-222
  208 _ PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
‘tion consists in observation under “controlled conditions,” 
and that “control” of the factors and the determination of 
results is made possible by accurate measurement and exact 
statistical analysis. They ought not to be surprised to learn 
that a science cannot merely be defined as a “field,”’ that it is 
a science only because of the use of a “‘method,” and that 
this method is common in its general principles in all sci- 
ences. 
If even high-school students could be led to understand 
that there are various types of scientific work designated as 
“experiments,” it would be easier for them to understand 
the full significance of true scientific method. If they were 
shown the difference between the experimentation of the 
pioneer,! the confirmatory or challenging experiments, and, 
finally, the academic experiment, it would be possible to get 
them to comprehend the real meaning of experimentation so 
that the method might be applied more generally in prac- 
tical matters. In the same connection some wholesome im- 
pressions might be gained as to the importance of “sus- 
pended judgment” on hypotheses, as was suggested in con- 
nection with the problem method. (See page 168). 
The true work of the high-school laboratory. Aside from 
the purposes outlined above, with special emphasis on the 
necessity of developing the true scientific attitude, labora- 
tory work in the high school should be given a far more prac- 
tical bent. This applies equally to general science work in 
the grades. The science curriculum, as is the case with most 
other subjects, is largely determined by textbook writers, 
and the majority of these are too much influenced by the 
college specialist’s aim of making the work in the public 
schools preparatory. In spite of this preparatory emphasis 
the universities may be charged with a strange inconsist- 
1 Sanford’s How to Study, gives a most interesting illustration of this in a 
résumé of Newton’s work.
-P-A-G-E-223
  THE LABORATORY METHOD 209' 
ency, in that they usually; insist the high-school year of 
science must be repeated “more thoroughly” after the 
student enters college. No one but the college specialist can 
stop this discouraging repetition, as far as the college stu- 
dents are concerned. 
The high-school teacher of science should take for granted 
that the necessary preparation will be done thoroughly by 
the university science courses anyway, and make up his own 
course with prime consideration of the social needs of the 
great majority of his classes who will not be able to go to 
college. New types of science textbooks and laboratory 
guides, with this point of view, are beginning to appear as 
the leaders of high-school science teaching enter the field of 
textbook authorship. 
Where the adopted textbooks are of the college-prepara- 
tory type, science teachers may give their laboratory work a 
more practical turn, and a similar type of material may be 
introduced in the demonstration-lecture periods. These 
offer another helpful form of the “‘object-lesson” method, 
and one that is perhaps even more economical than the 
laboratory method. 
AsstcNMENT: Make a list of such “practical problems” as might 
be taken up in some particular science. 
2. Difficulties and dangers of laboratory work 
There are several difficulties and dangers connected with 
nearly all forms of “object-lesson” teaching — in the simple 
object observations in the elementary school, in laboratory 
work, and in field trips or excursions. 
Mechanical work, and loss of time. In laboratory work 
there is the special difficulty of pupils’ merely following out 
mechanically the directions of a Manual. There is little 
mental reaction, often no clear conception of the purpose of 
the experiment, and, not uncommonly, a dishonest juggling
-P-A-G-E-224
  210 PROGRESSIVE. METHODS OF TEACHING 
with data obtained in order to make the experiment “come 
out right.” This danger has been recognized by many 
teachers of science, and preventive measures can be taken 
to lessen considerably this kind of work. 
Loss of time through inefficient classroom management is 
another defect of much laboratory work. A recognition of 
the fact that much time may be wasted under the informal 
conditions that have to prevail in the laboratory, has led 
many teachers to prefer the demonstration lecture. Stu- 
dents waste time dawdling and visiting during the time of 
setting up apparatus, and it is not an uncommon experience 
to find some just prepared to undertake the actual experi- 
ment when the pericd closes. The sciences in high school 
have been given a generous share of the students’ time, but 
it has been pointed out, with considerable justice, that “it 
is by no means clear that the sciences can profitably use 
double periods.” ! 
This same waste of time must be carefully guarded against 
in every type of “object-observation” lesson. If all pupils 
are to have the experience and contact with the realities in- 
volved, a sufficient number of specimens must be provided 
for all, efficient means of distributing them must be care- 
fully planned, and pertinent questions and suggestions to 
direct the observations progressively must be thought out 
carefully in advance. 
Dangers in excursions and field trips. Similar careful 
planning is highly important in order that all may see the 
things that were intended, and to keep the excursion from 
being a futile frolic as far as educative values are concerned. 
This danger is so apparent that too many teachers hesitate to 
undertake excursions, though they are willing to recognize 
the educative possibilities “if the trip could be managed.” 
1 Judd, Chas. H., Introduction to the Scientific Study of Education, page 
260.
-P-A-G-E-225
THE LABORATORY METHOD 211 
Such management is possible. Any teacher who can con- 
trol her group properly in a classroom should be able to 
make the excursion a success, if sufficient foresight is taken. 
Strayer has given us an admirable series of suggestions for 
such observation excursions: ! 
1. The teacher must have clearly defined in her own mind the 
purposes of the observation. ... 
It is not enough that the teacher know just what data she 
expects the children to gather toward the solution of a par- 
ticular problem; she must know exactly what data are availa- 
ble under the conditions governing the observation. 
8. The preliminary work must have prepared children for their 
observations by giving them very definite problems to solve. 
Often it will be advantageous to have these problems written 
in notebooks. 
4. Children not only need to want to see, but also need to be 
directed while they are observing. Nothing is easier than to 
look and not see what is essential. 
5. It is always advisable to test the success of the observations 
while they are being made. ‘There is nothing more difficult 
than to correct a misconception growing out of careless or 
inadequate observations. 
6. It is well to remember that not merely number of observa- 
tions counts in the solution of a problem. It is rather ob- 
servations under varying conditions which give weight to our 
conclusions. One intensive observation may be worth a 
thousand careless ones. 
7. When children are taken on excursions, great care must be 
exercised to keep them under proper guidance and control. 
The organization of children into smaller groups with leaders 
who are made responsible for their proper observance of direc- 
tions will help. These leaders should have been over the 
ground with the teacher before the excursion. The assistance 
of parents, teachers, or of older pupils will at times be neces- 
sary. 
8. There should be definite work periods during the excursion, 
just as in the schoolroom or laboratory. 2.

9. A whistle, as a signal for assembling at one point, will help in 
out-of-door work, provided it is clearly understood that this 
signal must be obeyed immediately, and under all circum- 
stances. 
Desire for expensive apparatus. A third difficulty often 
met with in connection with science teaching in the upper 
grades, and especially the high school, is the desire or felt 
need on the part of the instructor for too costly and too 
intricate apparatus. This is especially true of beginning 
teachers, just out of the university. They come from lab- 
oratories equipped on an expensive scale, containing, natu- 
rally, all known equipment for each of the sciences. Much of 
this is necessary only for advanced courses and for research. 
They have never been shown that effective work can be 
done, during the first year of any science, with a great deal 
of home-made equipment. Science students looking for- 
ward to work in the public schools should make equipment 
a special study, and should build up a list of needed mate- 
rials, with sketches or descriptions. Some teachers, with a 
special gift at mechanical ingenuity, have worked this out to 
a remarkable degree, even in universities. Science teachers, 
in their early years of teaching, should make it a point to 
visit a number of university and high-school laboratories, 
with a special view to discovering possibilities along this line. 
AssIGNMENT: Collect a list of such “home-made” apparatus for 
teaching any one of the sciences. 
AssicNMENT: Write up your own experiences as a student with 
the laboratory method or object lessons. Evaluate the ex- 
perience critically. Did you learn any impressive, lasting 
lessons? Did any of the dangers and difficulties mentioned 
defeat the purposes that were intended? Do you have any 
objections to laboratory work in science? 
The field for the “object-lesson” method. It is already 
apparent from the foregoing discussion that the object-
-P-A-G-E-227
THE LABORATORY METHOD 218 
lesson, in the form of laboratory work, is prominent in the 
teaching of all the sciences. It has also been brought out 
that there are simpler forms of the object-lesson and of ob- 
servation work than the laboratory exercises, which, in most 
sciences, have considerable of the “experimental” spirit 
about them. But, as commonly conducted in the high 
schools, it is worth while noting that there is a marked dif- 
ference between the type of laboratory work done in physics 
and chemistry, on the one hand, where experimentation is 
more prominent, and the laboratory activities of the natural 
sciences — botany, zoélogy, and biology — on the other 
hand, where accurate and minute observation is more em- 
phasized. 
This brings out the fact that the “laboratory method” 
does not necessarily involve experimentation, and inciden- 
tally refutes the claim often heard that a subject is not sci- 
entific or cannot be considered a “science” unless experimen- 
tation is carried on. In a certain sense experimentation, the 
“control of conditions or factors,” is quite impossible in the 
most exact of all sciences, astronomy. What appears to be 
experimentation is really nothing more than the “control” 
of the instruments of measurement. All the rest of the work 
is pure observation, carried on with a wonderfully exact 
mathematical precision, so that more remarkable predic- 
tions are possible in this science than in any other. And 
exact predictions as to what will happen under certain con- 
ditions are the goal of every science. Only in astronomy all 
the conditions are assumed to be as fixed as the constancy 
of the universe. 
The laboratory method. Under the “laboratory method,” 
then, we may fairly subsume all objective observational 
exercises, or we may revise the point of view, as has been 
done in this chapter. We have been speaking of the labo- 
ratory method as a phase of the more general idea of teaching
-P-A-G-E-228
  214 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
by the use of objects, or by the process of observation. The 
reason for making the obverse suggestion was that teachers 
of more strictly academic subjects are beginning to recog- 
nize the values and possibilities of doing something like 
“laboratory work” in their subjects. Usually this means 
one or two things: 
(1) The introduction of some form of illustrative reality — ex- 
hibits, models, products, and the like. 
(2) Or it may mean a carefully planned series of direct instruc- 
tions for the pupils’ activities, for the solution of a problem, 
similar to that given in laboratory manuals, and having 
pupils carry out these instructions under supervision and 
with supplementary suggestions. In reality this is practi- 
cally the equivalent of supervised study, as defined in Chap- 
ter IV (page 114). 
There is no particular objection to this rather loose use of 
the term “laboratory work.” More strictly it would be 
more appropriate if the latter term were used only if the 
pupil activity were actually confined to exact observation or 
experimentation. This context suggests one of the common 
misconceptions students have of an “experiment,” due to 
an effort to derive a definition from the etymology of the 
word, “trying to do something,” or often “trial-and-error” 
learning. To use the term “laboratory work” for such a 
type of learning is carrying the loose construction alto- 
gether too far. 
But there is an advantage to be gained for a teacher of 
English or history, or any other non-science subject, in at- 
tempting to introduce the method and spirit of laboratory 
work into the class exercises, especially if a conscientious 
effort is made to combine both of the alternative concep- 
tions suggested above — “illustrative realities,” and a 
“carefully planned series of pupil instructions.” 
For example, in English composition work, in the teaching

THE LABORATORY METHOD 215 
of the proper form for business letters, a collection of models, 
with varying approved practices in address, superscription, 
subscription, punctuation, may be introduced. This may 
be accompanied by the assignment of definite letter-writing 
problems, with instructions for observation and production 
carefully worked out in individual assignment sheets or in a 
common assignment on the blackboard, to be carried out 
under supervision and with consultation during the class 
period. Several composition textbooks that carry out this 
“Jaboratory-manual” idea, are among the interesting de- 
velopments in secondary School English Work.

Reviews and drills distinguished. In reviews, material once 
studied is gone over a second time for some definite purpose. 
The form of the review, that is, the degree of its intensity, is 
usually determined by the purpose for which the review is 
taken. What these purposes are will be taken up in the next 
section. The definition was given at this point to make the 
distinction between the review and the drill exercise, which 
is to be taken up in the following chapter. The drill in- 
volves continued repetition, with a view to practically a 
permanent retention of the material studied. The aim of 
the drill is to insure a practically automatic response; the 
aim of the review does not necessarily involve this. 
Reviews not tests or examinations. The review lesson 
should not be thought of as in any sense a test or examina- 
tion. Pupils should be made to understand this attitude on 
the part of the teacher clearly. Only those who are hope- 
lessly wedded to the “recitation-testing” method in daily 
class periods will think of the review as being similarly an 
examination over an extended section of work. The review 
should rather be thought of as a preparation for a test. The 
same waste of time and inefficiency, but on a still larger scale 
than in the daily recitation-test, is present in the oral-review
-P-A-G-E-233
REVIEW LESSONS 219 
test. The whole class can be tested far more thoroughly on 
the whole section of work by methods shown in Chapter 
XI. With the necessity of sampling a pupil’s knowledge 
over the larger field, the chances for injustice or fortunate 
accident are even greater in the oral-review recitation. 
Pupils facing a review-test of this type are apt to feel at sea, 
especially if the teacher has, by past performances, shown 
that she is likely to introduce catch questions and unimpor- 
tant details in the review-tests. 
1. Purposes of reviews 
To select and fix main points. The most common purpose 
and form of the review is the going over large amounts of 
subject-matter for the purpose of fixing most important 
points, for at least a definite time of testing or examination. 
Reviewing for this purpose involves two activities: 
(1) A rapid skimming of the whole field for the purpose of select- 
ing important elements, unless this has been done in such a 
way during the first study that pupils already have this in 
notebook outlines; and, 
(2) The effort to fix these outstanding items. 
If the pupils have no record of this material from their 
previous study there will usually be two assignments for a 
review, with a class discussion on the first step, in order that 
all in the class may have an opportunity to compare their 
selective results with some common composite. This in- 
volves a valuable opportunity for experience in evaluating 
their judgments of what is important. If the ultimate pur- 
pose of the review is preparation for a test or examination, 
pupils should be given to understand definitely that they 
have the duty of “fixing” after the selection has been made. 
The two steps are often combined in a single assignment 
process by giving the class a list of the questions that are to 
be given on the test or examination, and leaving the pupils 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
220 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
on their own responsibility for working out and fixing the 
answers. There is little objection to this method, if the set 
of questions covers the whole field quite thoroughly and is 
not a mere sampling. A more extended list of questions can 
be given than can be used in the test, and pupils can be given 
to understand that the test questions are to be chosen from 
this longer list. It is hardly necessary to add that faith 
must be kept with the pupils, if such an arrangement is an- 
nounced. It should also be pointed out that, if this method 
is used, the test questions must really involve a review plan, 
and must not resort to obscurities or “catch” problems. 
One of the chief values of such a review is the giving of a 
special opportunity to the slower pupils to get elements they 
were unable to handle on the first study. The review is 
undertaken with the advantage of meeting problems with 
a somewhat enlarged apperception, and matters only half 
comprehended on the first study can now be more easily 
taken in with the added knowledge that has come with later 
contacts. This method helps to serve a group which cannot 
be kept at each step until mastery is perfect, because of the 
conditions of inequality of ability in the classifications that 
are necessary in mass education. 
Reorganization or revaluation of knowledge. A second 
purpose of reviews is that of reorganization or revaluation. 
When a large field of content material has been covered 
once, it may be gone over a second time or repeatedly from 
different points of view, either for the purpose of building up 
new association-groups, for fixing data by possible compari- 
sons or contrasts, or for giving a new — usually a length- 
ened — perspective. 
This method may be illustrated in much of the geography 
work. Children in the study of Europe usually take up the 
matter for the first time by countries — the conventional 
method of presentation in the textbooks. For England,
-P-A-G-E-235
REVIEW LESSONS 221 
France, Germany, and most of the other countries they 
take up, in succession, the physical characteristics, the polit- 
ical organization, possibly a bit of the history, the leading 
industries, the prominent cities, and so on. After the study 
of the continent has been completed, in this manner, a 
series of reviews on each of these topics makes possible a 
reorganization that will bring together related facts for the 
different countries with reference to each of the topics indi- 
cated. The “type” studies in geography, as worked out by 
the McMurrys, and referred to in the chapter on the induc- 
tive-development lesson (page 83), illustrate some of the 
effective work that is possible in this type of review. The 
use of the inductive principle, that is, the working out of 
explanatory generalizations from the scattered data, is one 
of the most important that has been achieved in elementary 
teaching technique, and has done much to put the art of 
geography teaching on a higher plane, for several decades, 
than any other elementary-school subject. 
Assignment: Draw up a plan for a “reorganizing” review in 
some selected section of a particular textbook; for example, a 
history. 
To give an apperceptive basis for further study. A third 
form of review serves a less formal purpose — the selective 
recall of known materials for bringing to the minds of the 
pupils the necessary apperceptive foundation for the study 
of new material. This has already been pointed out (pages 
76-78) as a characteristic phase of the “preparation” step of 
the inductive-development lesson. Usually such a review is 
made informally in the class period, but it must nevertheless 
be carefully planned from the point of view of proper selec- 
tion of elements. Only such items as are necessary for the 
understanding or undertaking of the new work must be 
selected for such reviews. Logical completeness of past

‘relationships may be ignored. If the concept of a compound- 
complex sentence is the new idea to be taught, it is neces- 
sary to review the concepts of the compound and the com- 
plex sentence; the simple sentence need not be brought in, 
and a review of declarative and interrogative sentences 
would also be out of place. 
But such “apperceptive” reviews are not necessarily con- 
fined to the inductive lesson: Ifa class period is to be given 
to a series of reports or topical recitations in a history class, 
the outline or core, as gained from the textbook study, may 
be reviewed briefly as a unifying background. This may 
sometimes be advisable as a unit of work at the beginning of 
the period; it may be introduced piecemeal between the suc- 
cessive reports; or it may be made after all the reports have 
been given to lend them a final perspective. Either the first 
or second method is probably preferable as a general practice. 
Again, pupils should be encouraged, more than is com- 
monly done, to review for themselves the material of the 
immediately preceding lesson or lessons before beginning a 
new assignment, if it is related to the new assignment in 
such a way as to make the recall of such material helpful. 
For revealing weak points. A fourth form of review may 
be for the purpose of pointing out weak places in learning, a 
revealing test. Such exercises will usually be surprise af- 
fairs, and are intended to show pupils important elements in 
their past work that have not been as effectively fixed as the 
teacher expects. This type of work not only serves the 
direct purpose of revealing their weaknesses to the pupils; 
it also constitutes an effective form of motivation for more 
careful and thorough work, and for frequent self-reviews, if 
the pupils know this method is a part of the teacher’s habit 
of work. This type of review, with its values and the psy- 
chological justification, will be taken up more fully a little 
further on in the chapter.
-P-A-G-E-237
REVIEW LESSONS 223 
Another form of this review is that often followed by 
teachers after tests have been given. The tests are given 
with a double purpose — to evaluate the work or grade the 
pupils, and to discover their weak points or misunder- 
standings. The written test, then, serves formally to attain 
the revelation that was suggested as the motive of the re- 
view before testing. 
Using the review to impress visitors. A final purpose for 
which reviews are sometimes used is an unworthy one, and 
must be noted merely as a matter of warning. Teachers 
often resort to the review to impress a visitor, especially a 
supervisor. Such a refuge does not impress, unless it be 
with the thought that the teacher is afraid to go on with the 
regular work that was in progress when the visitor enters. 
In a sense such demonstrations are not genuine reviews. 
They are merely recitation tests over a large field, with a se- 
lection of items that are probably better known by the pupils. 
AssiGNMENT: What is the type of review involved in the “Re- 
view Problems,” given at the end of this textbook? 
AssIGNMENT: Write a section that you think would be suitable 
for this part of the chapter on “The Difficulties or Dangers 
Connected with Reviews.” 
2. The value and conduct of reviews 
The value of frequent short reviews. The importance of 
frequent, brief reviews, perhaps daily, both in study and in 
recitation, is frequently overlooked, although the value of 
early reviews is one of the best established facts in the psy- 
chology of learning. Very definite studies have been made 
by psychologists on the rate of forgetting. These studies 
have shown, most convincingly, that a few minutes of re- 
view within the first day or two after original learning pays 
bigger returns in the way of permanent retention than many 
times as much effort expended in the original learning. 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  
224 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
We may illustrate this concretely. If one spends five min- 
utes to-day in reviewing a poem which it took an hour to 
memorize yesterday, the review will help hold a larger per- 
centage of the total for a month or so than the original hour 
would fix. True, the five minutes would be of little value 
without the hour of original learning; equally significant, the 
hour of original learning is of little permanent value without 
the occasional few minutes of review. 
How to conduct fixing reviews. More definite directions 
should probably be given for the reviews that are intended 
to fix the more important elements of a subject. 
a. Give “organizing” questions, expecting both extensive 
and intensive preparation. The questions will first have the 
intention of directing pupils to select the main points of a 
general topic. Several typical illustrations may be given. 
In a history review, these organizing questions will be of 
this type: 
(1) What were the chief phases of a particular movement? 
(2) Who were the leaders or prominent men in the era, and what 
part did each play? 
(3) What were the contributing causes of a certain important 
event or movement? 
Or assuming the section on European geography, previ- 
ously referred to, we would formulate questions such as the 
following: 
(1) Be able to name and locate the principal rivers of Europe; 
the principal cities. 
(2) What industries are important in most of the countries? 
(3) What is the leading industry of each country? 
In working out answers to such questions it will often be 
helpful for pupils to make written outline answers to the 
1 See a synopsis of such experimental studies in Starch, Daniel, Educa- 
tional Psychology, pages 156-58.
-P-A-G-E-239
  REVIEW LESSONS 225 
questions. This will make possible a checking up of individ- 
ual pupil efforts with those of others in the class, or will give 
the teacher an opportunity to set the pupil straight on ma- 
terial not clearly grasped. : 
The second phase of such an assignment must not be 
overlooked. Pupils must be instructed to fix these outline 
answers, as well as make them, unless it is understood that 
a class discussion for purposes of comparison and correction 
is to precede this. 
b. Give sampling short tests, especially as surprises, as a 
helpful means of motivation and as a good background for a 
review of essentials, with an assurance that each pupil will 
have been forewarned as to his particular needs for the sub- 
sequent fixing review. The form of tests, so as to make 
them economical of class time and in correcting, will be sug- 
gested in detail in Chapter XI. 
c. The oral class review, with codperative contributions, 
may either follow the preparation of pupils on organizing 
questions outlined above, or it may be undertaken more in- 
formally without that preparation. The discussions may be 
impromptu, with helpful contributions by the brighter or 
more conscientious pupils, but the slower pupils will also 
profit by such an exercise. The results must be such as to 
be recognized clearly by the pupils, either in something like 
several repetitions, or in an exact summary restatement by 
the teacher, or in condensed outlines on the blackboard for 
pupils to jot down in their notebooks. 
Such class discussions must adhere closely to their original 
intention; they must move progressively and efficiently over 
the large field marked out; and they must not be allowed to 
fall into the wasteful shoals so common in recitation periods. 
This is not the time for testing; no review values are gained 
if the discussion halts to “show up” too many of the poorer 
students. Let this be reserved for the following test itself.
-P-A-G-E-240
  226 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
d. Teach pupils how to “cram.” This practice is often - 
disapproved. But usually certain conditions of previous 
neglect are then taken for granted. The ability to cover a 
large amount of ground, with the intention of using the re- 
sults for an emergency, is really worthy of some practice. 
There is an element of efficiency in the method, by way of 
high-pressure attention and the devising of schemes for fix- 
ing essentials, that all should learn with a view to probable 
use in further school work, or in life by way of preparing for 
emergencies. Pupils should be taught the technique of 
making such reviews efficiently, somewhat along the line of 
method that has been suggested in the previous sections. 
e. Plan a program of reviews. In planning the semester’s 
work the teacher should definitely commit herself to a pro- 
gram for reviews. These should be set for all the natural 
large divisions of a semester’s work, each chapter or a set of 
chapters, depending on the grade of advancement of the 
class and the character of the textbook. In addition to this 
there should be frequent, shorter reviews as particular occa- 
sions seem to warrant them. The reasons for the latter, and 
also for encouraging pupils to do considerably more of this 
type of work independently, have already been stated.

those of the following chapter.)

A new attitude toward drill. At present the attitude of 
many teachers toward drill work is undergoing a wholesome 
change. We are coming back to drill, which, until recently, 
and for several decades, was regarded as old-fashioned and 
almost as out of date as corporal punishment. The neglect 
of necessary drill work has been one of the bases for just 
criticisms of the “soft pedagogy” in the schools. The newer 
educational psychology, however, is giving us an analysis of 
school objectives which leaves us no alternative, in some 
subjects. 
The school has the task of increasing the pupil’s stock of 
usable knowledge, but it also has to train him in certain 
skills, habits, abilities, and attitudes. All material which 
involves skill or habit, which necessitates the making of a
-P-A-G-E-242

reaction, or the performance of a process, automatic, that is, 
wholly or largely uncontrolled by consciousness, must be 
acquired by practice, constant repetition, and drill, and can 
be acquired in no other way. There may be some help in 
the practice by understanding the process, or the work may 
be made more agreeable or efficient by an appeal to certain 
attitudes, but the necessity of repetition — to the point 
of “over-learning” — cannot be ignored. While the word 
“drill” has acquired certain unpleasant associations, as the 
compulsory movements under direction of a superior, the 
fact remains that skills and habits can only be learned by 
constant repetition and such practice need not take the dis- 
agreeable form of compulsion. 
The definition given of drill in the previous chapter, to dis- 
tinguish it from review work, may be repeated here. Drill 
ts a continued repetition of any learning process, with a view to 
practically permanent retention, or automatic response. 
AssIGNMENT: Find several statements or arguments for or 
against drill work in school. Consult especially the indexes of 
educational books dealing with psychology or methods, and 
the bibliographies giving references to some of the periodical 
literature. Look in the indexes of the Proceedings of the Na- 
tional Education Association. Collect extracts from several 
addresses that show trends 15 or 20 years apart. 
The value of skilis and habits. Useful skills and good 
habits are an essential in efficiency for all of us. Much of 
the world’s work must be done by skilled hands and minds, 
and can be done only by such dextrous, automatic perform- 
ances, controlled by proper ideals of pride in workmanship 
and of worthy social service in daily occupation. Too much 
emphasis has perhaps been put on the need for skill in man- 
ual work, and too little on efficient, ready technique in men- 
tal work. The training by drill must not be confined to the 
shops and laboratories. It must not be degraded as a form
-P-A-G-E-243
  SKILLS, HABITS, AND DRILL 229 
of learning especially adapted to the slower mental types 
who will probably not continue intellectual pursuits. The 
noblest arts and professions place a high premium on man- 
ual skill, and the humblest mental worker needs the same 
type of training for thinking that he needs for trade prepara- 
tion. A priggish avoidance of drill because of the associa- 
tions with physical or motor skills is quite out of place in a 
theory of instruction. 
The major part of an adult’s day, in his work, his reading, 
his conversation, his recreation, is spent on the moron level 
as far as necessary intellectual effort is concerned, that is, we 
can make most of our necessary mental reactions in life on 
the level of twelve-year-old intelligence. Much of this ap- 
parent lack of necessity for higher thought is probably due 
to the fact that so much of the day’s activity may and should 
be reduced to the automatic level. Reducing activities to 
the level of skills and habits makes for economy and effi- 
ciency, as well as for a release of mental energy for more use- 
ful possibilities. 
A realization of this economy of habit should lead the 
teacher to make the most careful analysis of subject-matter 
and processes in every school subject that she teaches, in 
order that she may isolate the items suited to skill or habit 
development. For these, effective drill programs must be 
carefully planned. The wastefulness in neglecting drill 
phases in school is painfully apparent to teachers of ad- 
vanced arithmetic, when dealing with pupils who have not 
been properly trained, to automatic readiness and one hun- 
dred per cent accuracy, in the skillful use of the tables and 
ordinary number-combinations. In content subjects the 
same inefficiency in technique of study is apparent in high- 
school and university students. Wasteful study habits 
again are due to lack of drill, as well as a lack of an under- 
standing of economical and effective methods of work.  
-P-A-G-E-244
  230 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Types of skills. The various skills that are prominent in 
the school subjects may be classified into three distinct 
groups: 
1. Physical or motor skills; 
2. Automatic fact associations, or memorized subject-matter; 
and 
8. Mental-method skills. 
Each of these requires some explanation and illustration. 
The illustrations may be drawn in some detail, from par- 
ticular elementary-school subjects. Incidentally these illus- 
trations will show how the analyses of learning processes by 
educational psychologists have contributed greatly to effi- 
ciency in teaching and learning. 
1. Physical or motor skills 
Skills vs. habits. This type of skill is specially prom- 
inent in writing, typewriting, manual training, and physi- 
cal education. The activities in such subjects are not clas- 
sified as physical skills because they are exclusively motor. 
Mental activity is more or less prominent in such processes, 
but it finds expression in the codrdination of mind and body, 
with the accurate physical reaction or response prominent. 
Some would classify habits in such a way as to reserve the 
term “skill” only for activities of this type, in which phys- 
ical activity is prominent. 
A formal definition may help us in the explanation and 
comparison. Skill has been defined ! as: 
The familiar knowledge of any art or science, united with readi- 
ness or dexterity in execution or performance, or in the application 
of the art or science to practical purposes; power to discern and 
execute; ability to perceive and perform; expertness; aptitude; as, 
the skill of a mathematician, physician, surgeon, mechanic, etc. 
  
1 International Dictionary
-P-A-G-E-245
  SKILLS, HABITS, AND DRILL 231 
In comparing skill with dexterity, the following discrimi- 
nation is made: ! 
Skill is more intelligent, denoting familiar knowledge united to 
readiness of performance. Dexterity, when applied to the body, is 
more mechanical, and refers to habitual ease of execution. 
Habit is defined ! as: 
The involuntary tendency or aptitude to perform certain actions 
which is acquired by their frequent repetition ...a disposition or 
tendency leading us to do easily, naturally, and with growing cer- 
tainty, what we do often. 
While it is apparent that skill and habit have elements in 
common in that the ability or tendency to respond is due to 
frequent repetitions, the two do not necessarily have suffi- 
cient common characteristics to make it advisable to sub- 
sume one under the other. There are habits which have 
none of the fundamental qualities of skill about them. In 
fact habits may easily be conceived that are highly unskill- 
ful. For example, a man may have a very unskillful way, or 
habit, of lacing his shoes, or using a tool that is important in 
his trade. Again we may speak of skills that are not at all 
followed as habits. 
We should rather think of skill as a form of activity in 
which one has become expert, dextrous, or efficient by prac- 
tice or repetition; it is a term always complimentary to one’s 
mental control over the motor activities. But there is no 
necessary moral approval involved; a burglar may be skill- 
ful in some of his criminal activities. Many habits involve 
no such compliment to one’s physical or mental controls. 
Another reason for the confusion or frequent association 
of skills and habits lies in the fact that skills may, and habits 
always do, attain a stage of automatism, a condition when 
the activities involved are not consciously controlled. A 
1 International Dictionary.  
-P-A-G-E-246
  232 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
prominent element in most skills is the quick or accurate re- 
sponse, or both, to the stimulus, or the ready, easy sequence 
of responses, if a series is involved. 
Skill in handwriting. Formerly systems or methods of 
teaching handwriting consisted principally of copybooks, 
with models of varying degrees of slant and styles of letter- 
formation, which were to be imitated. Such methods were 
in time supplanted on the theory that handwriting thus be- 
came a sort of laborious and slow method of drawing, and 
that the copybook model at the top of the page almost 
naturally slipped out of sight as the pupil worked down the 
page, resulting in his imitation of his own gradually deteri- 
orating lines. 
The present-day systems of teaching handwriting are con- 
sciously based on the theory that writing is a motor skill, 
that mastery involves the learning, to a stage of practical 
automatism, of a certain codrdination of bodily position, 
free-arm movements, and finger controls. Each of these 
phases of the skill has been carefully analyzed out of the 
total learning situation, so that teaching attention may be 
distributed to these elements in practice. In the earlier 
stages of learning little emphasis is put on resulting product; 
attention is centered on the process or the correct perform- 
ance of the codrdinations involved. 
Skill in typewriting. The importance of skill in typewrit- 
ing can best be seen in a comparison of the “self-made” op- 
erator and one who has thoroughly mastered the touch sys- 
tem. The former is never freed from the necessity of read- 
justing his divided attention, now to his copy or his thought, 
now to the machine, or particular places on the keyboard. 
The skilled operator has trained himself to react directly and 
in rapid succession by the sense of feeling or the kinesthetic 
sense to the positions of all the symbols of the keyboard. 
There is a much higher degree of automatism, and the cir-
-P-A-G-E-247
SKILLS, HABITS, AND DRILL 233 
cuit of stimulus-response has been made a short-circuit 
which has eliminated the eye-search for the keys entirely, so 
that the work can even be done without symbol marks on 
the keys. 
The place of skill in manual training. Many teachers 
make the unfortunate mistake of thinking of manual train- 
ing, or any form of shop work, as merely manual. They as- 
sume a rather supercilious air of superiority for their own 
work of a more academic type, and advise manual-arts work 
for boys who are mentally slow, almost in a spirit of con- 
demning such to an inferior type of learning activity. This 
attitude is sometimes accompanied by an equally erroneous 
notion that if a boy cannot do well in academic work he will 
probably do quite well in manual work. In other words, an 
inverse or negative correlation between the two abilities is 
assumed, while the reverse is probably true. Then, too, the 
elements of planning, reading, and mathematical computa- 
tion as important phases of the manual arts are quite ig- 
nored. 
There is, of course, some excuse for this misconception, 
because of the prominence of physical skills in manual train- 
ing and trade courses. The mastery of every tool involves a 
separate skill, and many of the processes involved in con- 
struction, fitting, and finishing equally require training in 
skills, not to mention the operation of such machinery as 
may be used. Much of such learning has as its first step the 
imitation of an expert, the teacher. Because this observa- 
tion of objective materials and processes, this learning by 
imitation, is a more easy and simple method than the learn- 
ing through abstract symbols, pupils with limited mental 
ability can meet with some success in the manual subjects. 
There may be the additional stimulus to effort in the in- 
stinctive interest in real or material things. 
Skill in play, games, and gymnastics. Skills of different

  234 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
types are involved in the field of physical education, in the 
games and sports, the gymnastics, calisthenics, and folk- 
dancing. Some manual skills are involved in some of the 
games, but one valuable feature of all such is the prominent 
call for the training of the larger muscles and for the skillful 
codrdination of the whole body. 
In this connection we may also note that motor or physi- 
cal skills may involve group coéperation in drills, notably in 
calisthenics, gymnastics, folk-dancing, and maneuvers of 
various types. This is a distinctive form of skill from most 
of the individual skills that have been involved in the other 
illustrations given so far. 
AssiGNMENT: Make a list of all the physical “skills” you have 
learned, in or out of school. Was any one of them acquired 
efficiently? Whose fault was it that you did not learn any one 
of the skills in your list more quickly or more thoroughly? 
Save your paper for a future assignment. 
State one or two “habits” you have that are not “skills.” 
2. Automatic fact associations 
Memorizing fact associations. The second type of school 
activity involving learning by repetition or drill is the mak- 
ing of certain fact associations automatic, an activity com- 
monly designated as memorizing. There are varying degrees 
of intensity or exactness in such memorization work. In 
history and geography we are familiar with the memorizing 
or fixed association of isolated pairs of facts, such as dates 
and events, or states and capitals, or an extended sequence 
of facts that are merely related in some accidental succes- 
sion, such as a list of presidents or rulers. A more advanced 
type of memorization, because some element of thought 
usually enters in, may be illustrated by a recital of the 
thought of a passage, the principal items in a narrative, or 
the successive steps in an explanatory or argumentative
-P-A-G-E-249
  SKILLS, HABITS, AND DRILL 285 
passage. Sometimes the learning of definitions or rules 
would fall in this type, and it should always be of this char- 
acter. 
Often, though, such memorization must rather be de- 
scribed as the mere learning of more or less meaningless sym- 
bol associations. Rules are learned as a sequence of words 
that cannot be applied, because the abstract verbal symbols 
involved are not fully understood. Such memorizing of 
verbal sequences is also too often permitted in the rote learn- 
ing of poetry, when adequate comprehension is not insured 
by proper preliminary study of the passage. 
Combination skills. Certain school activities combine 
skills of the two foregoing types — motor skills and auto- 
matic fact associations. In learning to spell words correctly 
there is a large element of mere memorization of symbol, or 
letter sequences. There is some thought control in words 
that are spelled phonetically, and rarely some applications of 
general rules. But with the large number of exceptional, 
non-phonetic words in English, considerable drill has to be 
expended in fixing the proper letter combinations with cer- 
tain misleading sounds and meanings. While the fixing of 
symbolical associations is most prominent in the spelling 
skill, educational psychology has also shown that there is an 
element of motor control, largely resident in the vocal or- 
gans, and exercised almost unconsciously in most of us. 
A similar analysis could be made in almost every detail 
for correct or grammatical speech and writing. The ear or 
sound learning and control is more prominent; rules pro- 
bably play a more important part; and vocal-motor elements 
may also be analyzed out of the learning and expression ac- 
tivities. But here also the element of correct symbol-asso- 
ciations is the most important element in acquiring language 
mastery. Drill and repetition of correct forms must be 
prominent in the formation of language habits, and espe-   
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  236 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
cially drill of the ear-training type, for it is by that agency 
that correct as well as incorrect forms are largely fixed. 
3. Mental-method skills 
In making the foregoing analysis of various types of skill 
it was shown that in some of the school subjects, such as 
writing, typewriting, manual training, domestic science, 
and physical education, the physical or motor type was a 
prominent essential in the learning of these subjects. In 
important phases of other subjects, notably arithmetic, 
geography, and history, or in any piece of memorization, the 
making of fact-associations automatic was shown to involve 
drill. Again, in spelling and language work, combinations 
of these two types of skill were shown to be prominent factors 
in the mastery of these subjects. 
In illustrating the third type of skill, the ready use of 
mental-methods, we may make an analysis of reading, in 
which this type is prominent, but in which we also find 
important phases of the other two types of skill. 
Importance of various types of drillin reading. One of the 
great contributions of educational psychology to the art of 
teaching, in recent years, has been the analysis of the learn- 
ing processes and activities in the various school subjects. 
By such analyses certain important processes have been so 
isolated that in this simplified form experimentation was 
made possible. Such experiments with highly essential 
phases of the learning processes have resulted in valuable 
practical contributions toward promoting efficiency in both 
the teaching and learning. This may be illustrated in con- 
nection with the various phases of the work in reading. 
Beginning work in reading. In the earliest phases of 
learning to read pupils must have constant drill to fix the 
associations between ideas, represented by word-sounds, 
with written or printed forms of the word-symbol. A con-
-P-A-G-E-251
  SKILLS, HABITS, AND DRILL 237 
siderable stock of ideas associated with word-sounds has 
been acquired by the child during the years just before com- 
mencing school, and this stock is gradually enlarged by new 
experiences and exercises in vocabulary building. The 
learning of the reading process proper involves the fixing of 
the association of these ideas with the visual symbol. 
Whether this is done by the letter-spelling, syllabication, 
phonogram, whole-word, phrase, or sentence method is 
immaterial at this point. The process of associating symbol 
and idea is practically the same, and involves constant 
repetition until the association is fixed to the degree of an 
automatism. As this stock of fixed associations increases, 
the reading process is reversed and begins to consist of get- 
ting new ideas from such symbol combinations. 
Up to this stage of learning the reading process the neces- 
sity for drill on the physical or motor skill has not become 
very prominent, but as soon as the making of association- 
recognition and responses begins to become ready, two im- 
portant physical skills begin to demand attention. One of 
these is the process of pronunciation and enunciation in oral 
reading; the other is the control of eye-movements. These 
two motor skills have to be developed at about the same 
time, according to the latest findings of the experimenters in 
reading. Until very recently the necessity of improving 
control of the eye-movements in reading was unknown. The 
studies of educational psychologists who have revealed the 
importance of this skill have also shown the danger of pro- 
longing the drill in pronunciation, and other elements in- 
volved in oral reading, for too long a period in the child’s 
development. 
Oral control. Beginning as soon as the child has formed 
enough of the more common word-idea associations to read, 
oral reading becomes necessary in order that the teacher may 
give necessary instructions in correct pronunciation, enun-  
-P-A-G-E-252
  238 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
ciation, and other features involved in indicating meaning. 
How important this physical skill, the control of all the 
vocal organs, is may be seen in the contrast presented by a 
child who reads correctly and fluently and the child who has 
any of the more common speech-defects, such as lisping, 
stuttering, and stammering. The difficulties encountered by 
a foreign adult, often insurmountable, in learning to pro- 
nounce correctly, further illustrate the significance of these 
skills, which are so generally attained to a practical degree of 
perfection that their importance is often overlooked. The fact 
that most of us attain these pronunciation and enunciation 
skills to only a practically satisfactory degree of perfection 
may likewise be seen in the large number of niceties we vio- 
late when the study of orthoépy is taken up in adulthood. 
Eye-movement control. The second phase of motor 
skill involved in the learning of reading, the control of eye- 
movements, has recently been shown to be one of the most 
important phases of the reading ability. The invention of 
reading tests, in which an accurate record could be made of 
speed or rate of reading; the experimental analyses of the 
physiology of the silent-reading process; 1 and the experi- 
ments that have shown how large a percentage of improve- 
ment in rate of silent reading is possible even for educated 
adults ? — all tend to show the importance of training in 
proper habits in this physical skill. The fact that this skill 
is based on an inconspicuous reflex in the movements of the 
eyeball accounts for the fact that this element in reading 
skill was only recently discovered. But since its discovery,

the matter has been given such intensive study that the 
results are among the most important that the psycholog- 
ical laboratory has given to education. 
It was intimated that these two motor skills, oral control 
and eye-movement control, were to be developed at the same 
stage, and that drill in the former should probably be dis- 
continued after a few years. This is due to the fact that the 
oral-reading exercise begins to interfere with improvement 
in the more important skills involved in silent reading, effi- 
ciency in which is far more essential. Studies made in the 
University of Chicago educational laboratories have shown 
that at about the fifth-grade level the skill in the control of 
the eye in rate of reading begins to exceed the rate of vocal- 
organ codrdinations in oral expression. Beyond that point 
the further practice of oral reading, in any great amount, will 
interfere with improvement in the rate of silent reading and 
thought-getting to such an extent as to make the whole 
process an irksome one that may seriously affect the child’s 
whole reading future. 
Practice in the third type of skill involved in reading, the 
acquiring of mental-method technique of various sorts, 
should have been started in a limited way in the interme- 
diate grades, and will continue to offer opportunities for prac- 
tice and improvement as long as school life continues, even 
through the university. These mental-methods, such as 
skimming, outlining, getting the paragraph topic, the use 
of indexes, the art of bibliography, and others have been 
fully described in Chapter IV, dealing with Supervised 
Study. 
4. The laws of habit formation 
The attainment of skills of various types in all of these 
school subjects involves some or all of the so-called laws of 
1 See especially pages 90-96. 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
240 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
habit formation. These laws are rather a set of common- 
sense psychological principles that have largely been evolved 
empirically, although some are beginning to be reinforced 
by experimental data. These principles were first an- 
nounced by James, and have been modified and amplified 
by other writers until now they have become such a com- 
mon tradition in the manuals of general psychology and the 
introductory textbooks in education courses that any ex- 
tended discussion of them is probably unnecessary. Their 
special reference to the learning of some of the skills that 
have been mentioned may, however, be illustrated. A few 
of the important principles will be stated. 
Get the correct start. A great deal of attention must be 
given to “form,” at the time when the learning of a skill is 
started. A detailed analysis of every phase of a complicated 
movement should be in the mind of the teacher, and the 
learner should be made conscious of these elements. In the 
case of motor skills, teaching by model or learning by imita- 
tion is possible, and is far preferable to learning by “trial and 
error.” By the latter method the learner is too apt to be 
satisfied with a partial success, and the practice is then con- 
tinued in the “form” in which such partial success is at- 
tained. This is strikingly illustrated in the case of the self- 
taught typist. One who has learned typewriting by such 
trial-and-error or hunt-and-peck methods has much greater 
difficulty in learning the touch system later, because there 
isfirst'a series of incorrect habits to be unlearned which inter- 
fere with the learning of the reactions in the more efficient 
system. The same is true of the skills and habits involved 
in writing, spelling, and language mastery. In the case of 
the last of these the school is at a serious disadvantage be- 
cause the incorrect habits get such a considerable start be- 
fore the child comes to school, and also, as we shall see in 
following sections, because there is a continuous and even
-P-A-G-E-255

SKILLS, HABITS, AND DRILL 241 
more considerable exposure to the fixing of wrong speech- 
habits in the out-of-school associations. 
AsaziGNMENT: Show, in the same way, from your own experience, 
that the learning of a skill by imitation is also more effective 
and economical than learning it from abstract verbal direc- 
tions. 
Where the school starts the process of learning skills it is 
important that the law of correct habit initiation should be 
strictly observed. The correct, efficient technique may be 
more difficult and complex at the beginning, and more dis- 
couraging as far as immediate results are concerned — the 
experiences one has with “systems” of handwriting and 
typewriting illustrate this — but where such systems have 
been established for a skill, by professional analysis and ex- 
_ perimentation, they must be followed conscientiously. As 
| Colvin well says: 4 
It is particularly essential in the beginning of all school activities 
that the teacher see to it that the pupil’s attention is upon that 
part of the learning which is essential for the correct formation of 
the habit to be desired. 
Be attentive in each repetition. The importance of this 
principle has well been illustrated by the challenge that has 
been given to the old adage that “practice makes perfect.” 
The revised form of the adage should read, “Correct prac- 
tice makes perfect,” while, obversely, incorrect or inatten- 
tive practice results in either incorrect or uneconomical 
learning. The former is readily seen in the case of language 
learning. It was suggested in the previous section that 
practice in speech does not make for correct language mas- 
tery. The greatest failure of the schools, the ungrammatical 
graduate, is a product of a double training. - The teacher has 
the pupil under her influence only a few hours each day, 
1 Colvin, 8. 8., The Learning Process, page 65.    
-P-A-G-E-256
  242 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
while the repetitions of language forms go on the rest of the 
day without the pupil’s giving any attention to the matter. 
This situation ought to demonstrate to us quite clearly 
that in many of the skills and habits, which we have to deal 
with in the schoolroom, the responsibility has to be assumed 
by the learner himself to insure any satisfactory results. 
The problem often has to be attacked as a problem in get- 
ting the right attitudes. The reader of compositions knows 
that the incorrectness of grammatical, spelling, and punctu- 
ation elements is, for most pupils, not a matter of ignorance 
or lack of understanding. Most errors of this sort in a com- 
position can be found in their correct forms more often in 
the same composition. 
All this is the evidence of incompleted skills, to the repeti- 
tion of which no attention is being given. In other words, 
this inattention is an attitude of carelessness on the part of 
the learner. The teaching problem becomes one of making 
the pupil want to care, or to give attention to the details of 
his expression habits. This raises the problem of drill 
motivation, which is to be taken up as a separate topic 
later (page 247f). Where the proper attitude cannot be 
secured, where the child refuses to take the responsibility 
for attentive correct repetition, the problem for drill becomes 
amore serious one. Fortunately the attitude is not enlisted 
on the opposing side either; the child is not willfully incor- 
rect in his spelling and grammar. He is neutral, inattentive 
to right or wrong; he does not care. Then it becomes a 
question of preponderance of correct experiences and ex- 
pression; so much drill must be given that the right sup- 
plants the wrong as a more ready and easy reaction. 
Permit no exceptions. An interesting illustration of the 
importance of this rule could be worked out in a discussion 
of the topic, “Why do most systems for teaching hand- 
writing fail?” There is no fault in the theory of these sys-
-P-A-G-E-257
  
  SKILLS, HABITS, AND DRILL 243 
tems, and there is no doubt that remarkable results can be 
secured by a few months of systematic training by any 
adult, but the imperfect result of years of such training in 
the elementary schools is largely to be attributed to the fact 
that the correct practice in the proper combination of motor 
skills involved is only insisted on for a half-hour or so daily 
during the handwriting practice period. All the rest of the 
day’s writing work is an exception or contradiction, to a 
greater or less degree, of the correct form. 
This is due to two natural practical difficulties. The 
teacher cannot supervise all writing work as if it were a 
writing lesson, and there seems to be a natural perversity in 
most children to do their ordinary writing work by some 
cramped, inefficient way they have acquired “out of 
bounds.” One may meet such a situation with a cynical 
helplessness, or a counsel of perfection. But the teacher 
may not ignore and neglect the effort to implant correct 
habits; nor can she, in some of the most vital social skills, 
hope to observe this law of “no exceptions.” She cannot 
turn the whole day and every day into a writing lesson. She 
cannot put gags and ear-mufis on the pupils when they 
leave the schoolroom to prevent the saying and hearing of 
incorrect speech forms. She must choose a happy mean 
between helpless despair and impossible perfection. She 
must do all she can to get the correct form practiced, and to 
get pupils to take the responsibility of correct attitude; but 
she must also learn to be content with limited success. 
“Over-learn ” the skill in most cases. The value of over- 
learning is one of the best authenticated rules, as far as 
experimentation is concerned. The law applies, perhaps, 
more distinctively to memorization and to some motor 
skills. The importance of “over-learning”’; that is, of learn- 
ing beyond the point where the skill is just attained or the 
memorized material can be recited the first time, has as its  
-P-A-G-E-258
Te Se ee! EE ROE ee ae CEES NTR EUR RRL OER Ge Pa RS Gate, DERE ot eae 
| 244 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
reciprocal what has been called the law of forgetting. The 
rate of forgetting is very rapid in the period immediately fol- 
| lowing the learning. One of the experimenters, in learning 
nonsense syllables, is reported to have forgotten as much in 
the first twenty minutes as in the following thirty days; 
another, in the remembering of a poem which had been 
learned to the point of two perfect repetitions, found that as 
much was forgotten in the first two days as in the next 
twenty-five days.! 
In evaluating the results of such investigations Starch 
makes the following practical deductions: 
The experimental work on forgetting is too limited as yet to 
permit of much definite application in the practical procedure of 
learning school material. The one suggestion that may possibly be 
made would be this: Since the rate of forgetting is very rapid at 
first and more gradual later on, it probably would be highly ad- 
vantageous to have relearning of a given material come very fre- 
quently at first, and more rarely later on. Thus the facts of a les- 
son in history or the newly acquired words of a spelling lesson 
should be reviewed the next day, or perhaps preferably on the 
same day, then again two or three days later, and then a week or 
ten days later, and so on.   Start strong. This principle is somewhat related to the 
first that has been given. The first had special reference to 
the “form” of the activity; this has in view the attitude or 
intent to learn. As James expressed it :? 
We must take care to launch ourselves with as strong and de- 
cided an initiative as possible. Accumulate all the possible cireum- 
stances which shall reinforce the right motives... envelop your 
resolution with every aid you know. 
Gratuitous practice for development. This was one of 
James’ original three rules of habit-formation, and was in- 
tended more directly to refer to habit in the moral realm of 
1 Starch, D., Educational Psychology, page 158.

SKILLS, HABITS, AND DRILL A5 
activity, although its implications for some of the types of 
skill that have been suggested will be evident, as, for ex- 
ample, in the field of language mastery. In summary this 
principle was originally stated as follows :! 
Seize the very first possible opportunity to act on every resolu- 
tion you make, and on every emotional prompting you may experi- 
ence in the direction of the habits you aspire to gain. ... No matter 
how full a reservoir of maxims one may possess, and no matter how 
good one’s sentiments may be, if one has not taken advantage of 
every concrete opportunity to act, one’s character may remain en- 
tirely unaffected for the better. . . . As a final practical maxim rela- 
tive to these habits of the will, we may, then, offer something like 
this: Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous 
exercise every day. 
AssIGNMENT: Review, and, if you think it worth while, in view of 
the discussion on “‘The Laws of Habit-Formation,” rewrite the 
last part of the paper you wrote on “Physical Skills,” in a 
previous assignment in this chapter. 
5. Practical teaching suggestions with reference to 
drill work 
Plan your drill work. Select the elements for drill or 
memory work as part of your semester planning. An effort 
has been made, in a considerable part of this discussion of 
drill, to show how prominent the skill-types of learning are 
in almost every elementary-school subject. Further illus- 
trations could be added for most of the high-school studies. 
The illustrations given were merely general suggestions, and 
were not at all intended as an exhaustive list involved in the 
subjects discussed. Such lists are beginning to be made 
available in the Manuals dealing with the special methods of 
teaching the various subjects. One of the important pieces 
of planning a teacher should do at the beginning of each 
semester is the drawing up of a list of items that will require 
1 James, Wm., Principles of Psychology, vol. 1, chapter tv, pages 124-27.
-P-A-G-E-260
  246 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
the use of drill methods. For each a scheme of motivation 
should be worked out, and a systematic search and record of 
suitable devices should be accumulated to make such drill 
work interesting and effective. 
AssianMEnt: Select a semester’s work in some school subject, 
and outline a plan of drill topics. For one or several of these 
make a list of motivation devices, or describe some drill game 
you would use. 
Plan some drill work early in the semester. Oppor- 
tunities for drill work are so plentiful in every school subject 
that but little adjustment of a semester’s program will be 
necessary to introduce some drill work early in each semes- 
ter. This is advocated for the psychological or “moral” 
effect it will have, especially on a new class. It will give the 
pupils an early impression that the teacher means business, 
and that she expects earnest work. It will be much easier if 
the start is madewith this attitude in the minds of the pupils; 
its wholesome effects will outlive the period of drill. 
Material selected for drill must be worth while. The 
pupils, too, should be helped to realize the values as fully as 
possible. Selections for memorization may be interesting, 
even if they are trivial; but they need not be uninteresting 
because they are worth while, worth knowing for a lifetime. 
If the choice lies between the worthy and the trivial, the de- 
cision should not be hard to make. Material that is mem- 
orized should have enough in it to grow on the learner as he 
memorizes the lines. It is wholly indefensible to require a 
pupil to spend hours on the learning of something that has 
no permanent values. 
We have here another illustration of the fact that we can- 
not always move in the child’s childish sphere of interests as 
a basis for the selection of subject-matter. This is true in 
the field of memorization, but even more so in regard to
-P-A-G-E-261
SKILLS, HABITS, AND DRILL Qa7 
much of the other material that must be mastered by the 
drill method, notably in some of the elements that have been 
suggested as skills or habits in writing, spelling, arithmetic, 
@ed-language work. To try to show the value of these to 
~ the pupils, as a part of the natural motivation for drill, the 
teacher will have to inform herself fully as to their possible 
social uses. The more immediately and the more evidently 
these can be related to the child’s present needs, the more 
effective such motivation will be, but there need be no hesi- 
tancy in trying to get pupils to understand as fully as they 
can the great practical importance of such elements in adult 
life. 
Motivate your drill work. Motivate drills by extrinsic 
interest if necessary, but only if necessary. If intrinsic in- 
terest is present, or can be aroused, it should be used. If it is 
possible to show a pupil the natural value or advantage or 
his need of the skill, this motivation must not be neglected. 
Again, drill itself, as drill, has fortunately considerable at- 
traction for most children. Repetition of familiar move- 
ments or of familiar ideas has some sort of fascination, and, 
as the consciousness of skill in the activity itself develops, 
there is an accompanying feeling of pleasure, satisfaction, 
and pride which will motivate the repetition. The ability to 
solve a puzzle the first few times does not end a child’s inter- 
est in it. A large part of the secret of craftsmanship lies in 
this satisfaction in skills attained, as well as in contempla- 
tion of the product, whose art to the creator lies in the recol- 
lection of the processes rather than in external standards of 
beauty and use. 
If, however, such intrinsic interests do not appeal as a 
motivation for practice and drill, there are a number of in- 
stincts to which appeal may be made, either to get the repeti- 
tions started, or continued with attention and interest. 
Dr. Starch has given us a critical summary of the possible 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  248 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
values of instincts in school work, especially as motivating 
the learning processes. He first shows ! that the number of 
instincts, in a list of forty-two, 
which may be directly and concretely appealed to in the learning’6f 
a school subject is relatively small... . Two thirds or three fourths 
of them are probably never immediately but only indirectly con- 
cerned in school exercises, and most of the remaining ones, such as 
rivalry, codperation, and collecting and hoarding, are serviceable 
chiefly as general motives. 
The importance of instincts as general motives, for drill 
work, as well as for other learning processes, and the channel 
through which such motivation flows, is then explained and 
illustrated by him, in the following paragraphs:” 
Perhaps the most important rdle of instinct in education lies in , 
motivating and energizing the learning processes. There can be no 
education except through the activity of the child himself; and no 
activity can take place which does not ultimately depend upon 
native tendencies. They are the origin of effort, the springs of 
action. The skillful teacher plays upon them and appeals to them 
in countless ways. The ability to do this is an art which is not 
easily learned from books; it is acquired rather by patient practice 
and by sympathetic contact with children. 
The energizing power of instinct makes itself felt largely through 
its control of the attention processes. ... 
Apparently back of every act of attention lies somewhere a more 
or less primitive, innate tendency to action. To focus the atten- 
tion of a class upon various associations involved in learning the 
multiplication table, a skillful teacher may on one day appeal to 
curiosity in the novelty of the combinations; on another day she 
may appeal to the native pleasure in rhythm by making the table 
into a rhyme or song. Or the tendency to play will be utilized by 
making the number combinations into a game. More than likely 
the game itself will depend upon instinctive rivalry and emulation. 
The love of social approval is appealed to by giving distinctions, 
marks, gilt stars, and the like. Future advantage may be used as 
an inducement for present application. The instinct of pugnacity   
1 Starch, D., Educational Psychology, page 12. 2 Ibid., pages 12-14. 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
4 
SKILLS, HABITS, AND DRILL 29 
may be utilized in wanting to succeed in a hard task. The teacher 
herself, in standing position with face and body in animated atti- 
tudes, may appeal to the fundamental interest in change and ac- 
tion. Lastly may be mentioned the more doubtful negative mo- 
tives of deprivation from coveted privileges and, biologically per- 
haps the most fundamental and powerful of all motives, physical 
pain. It may be worth noting that animal psychologists have 
found pain in some cases a more potent motive to learning than 
pleasure. 
One of the most effective devices that has been discovered 
to motivate learning through the instincts of pride and 
approval is the self-kept learning curve. This is especially 
adaptable to work in drill subjects, and is most effective in 
stimulating pupils along inevitable “plateaus” in the learn- 
_ing process, in preventing careless lapses, and in reversing 
such lapses to former or even greater efficiency when they 
are allowed to occur occasionally. The values of keeping 
such records of one’s learning have been demonstrated by 
accurate experimentation, and have been widely approved 
by experiences in the classroom. 
AssIGNMENT: Find some article in an educational magazine or a 
section in a book which opposes the appeal to extrinsic inter- 
ests as means of motivating learning. Try to evaluate the 
opposing views by thinking out how the question is solved 
practically in real life; for example, in business. 
Teach the concept and ideal of efficiency. One of the 
most potent attitudes or ideals that a pupil should get out 
of his whole school experience is the ideal of efficiency. 
This term has been overworked in recent years, and a rather 
unfortunate motive has been associated with it in the in- 
dustrial world. We cannot, though, ignore the fact of its 
importance in all learning processes, and especially in those 
that involve the attainment of skills by long periods of repe- 
tition and practice. 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
    250 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
The concept of efficiency involves two elements — getting 
the best results, and the economizing of time or energy in 
the process. The desire and determination to do these two 
things transforms the concept into an attitude or ideal that 
can have the most varied applications. The possession of a 
pride in efficiency is perhaps one of the most important ele- 
ments that will account for what was long thought to be 
transfer of training or mental discipline. The proof or dis- 
proof of the latter theory is still to be produced, but a much 
more effective program of teaching will result if we do not 
trust to the unconscious transfer or spread of learning ex- 
periences. Much more can be accomplished in training and 
disciplining the mind if concepts, such as efficiency and the 
technique of various mental-methods, are analyzed out of a 
learning situation for the pupils, and if they are taught to 
give these a general application to all their mental problems. 
The value of a conscious striving for efficiency, the combina- 
tion of excellence and economy, is easily demonstrated to 
any one who conscientiously tries to apply it in some new 
learning task, especially one that involves drill of any sort. 
Keeping a learning curve, referred to in the previous section, 
is but the objective representation of this ideal for one’s 
work and progress in learning. 
Vary the methods and motives in drill work. The experi- 
enced teacher who has read this chapter up to this point, 
may feel that there has been a studied effort to glorify drill 
work, and a determined ignoring of the drudgery involved. 
Unless one has a close daily contact with the labors of the 
elementary-school teacher, especially in the primary and 
intermediate grades, it would be easy to make this mistake. 
The greater part of the day must be spent in just the types 
of work that have been described, and, at best, there is a 
great deal of inglorious and wearing monotony about the 
learning of the fundamentals, both for teacher and pupils.
-P-A-G-E-265
  SKILLS, HABITS, AND DRILL 251 
The difference between the successful and the unsuccess- 
ful teacher in this type of work is marked by the extent to 
which study and ingenuity is expended in collecting and 
inventing devices for introducing variety. The compelling 
drill-master, who persists in monotonous, uninteresting 
regularity of method, gets no more happiness out of the 
day’s work than do the poor victims who are driven through 
their tasks. The humane, thoughtful teacher, who recog- 
nizes the true nature of such work as well as its necessity, 
devotes herself to all the varieties of motivation and all the 
play-interest that can be put into the required tasks. She 
substitutes her insight into childhood for their lack of vision 
as to the values of what they must learn.

New purposes for the class period. There are several modi- 
fications of the “recitation-testing” period that involve only 
slight changes in form and procedure, but which must be dis- 
tinguished from it because of an important difference in pur- 
poses. The conventional class period is a formal exercise, 
largely for individual testing purposes, with the oral 
“question-and-answer” method playing a prominent part 
in it. The modifications of this form in the methods to be 
discussed in this chapter are so slight, that the teacher who 
has been in the old wasteful rut of recitation-testing can  
-P-A-G-E-270
  256 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
perhaps use these types for her first experiments at improv- 
ing her class-period technique. 
The purpose of these modifications of the class period 
may be summarized by saying their aim is learning, rather 
than testing. Using the class period in helping the pupils to 
get clearer understanding of what they are to study individ- 
ually, or supplementing the previous individual study of the 
textbook during the class period, may take on a variety of 
forms, which should be discussed separately and with more 
or less detail, according to their variation from the original 
type form. The four most important modifications of the 
class period that have learning as their aim are: 
1. The Topical Recitation. 
2. The Lecture Method. 
8. The Discussion Period. 
4. The Socialized Recitation. 
We shall consider each of these, in order. 
1. The topical recitation 
The topical recitation has already been discussed at some 
length in Chapters I and II (see especially pages 19-20 and 
56-57). It is merely necessary in this connection to point 
out that the topical recitation is the easiest modifica- 
tion of the conventional plan, and that, unlike the other 
three forms to be discussed, it may, and usually does, retain 
some of the purpose of that plan, namely, testing or marking 
the individual pupil. But along with this, if the topical reci- 
tation deals with any supplementary material not studied by 
the whole class, it also serves the purpose of teaching the 
other pupils something in addition to the material learned 
in their own study. The details of the technique, and the 
values of this modification, do not need to be repeated here, 
but may be reviewed in the chapter on Collateral Reading.
-P-A-G-E-271
  THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 257 
2. The lecture method 
Nature and use of. This is nothing more than a topical 
recitation by the teacher, with the purpose of clarifying, 
interpreting, or supplementing the pupils’ learning from 
textbooks or other sources. There is a possibility of greater 
or less extension of the method. It may, and often does in 
university instruction, take up the entire class period, and 
furnishes the core or even the whole content of the subject- 
matter learned. 
For public school work we are not interested in this ex- 
treme form of instruction by listening, but a limited amount 
of it, often of a spontaneous character as the class-period 
emergencies demand it, is not out of place in elementary or 
high-school classes. Occasionally whole periods may be 
taken up in this way by the teacher. More often the teacher 
will use this method to supplement the material that is avail- 
able in the textbook, and the combined experiences or learn- 
ing of the class. Sometimes material learned may be re- 
stated in a formal way on some plan of reorganization which 
the teacher feels will contribute qualities of emphasis or 
clearness in the learning. 
Advantages and disadvantages of the lecture method. 
It must be kept in mind that methods are here being dis- 
cussed from the point of view of work in the elementary and 
high school, not in the university. The lecture method is a 
favorite form in higher education. A few university grad- 
uates attempt it on an extensive plan in their first weeks of 
high-school teaching, but are soon forced to abandon it be- 
cause of their own limitations, and because at this age, if 
carried to any length, “lecturing” taxes the good-will of 
their pupils beyond endurance. Immature pupils lack the 
necessary self-control for sustained auditory attention, with- 
out the opportunity for reaction or anticipation. They have
-P-A-G-E-272
  258 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
not, moreover, developed an ability to condense and an- 
alyze what they hear into satisfactory notebook résumés, 
and cannot be held responsible for the materials of such 
instruction. 
From the point of view of public school work then, we are 
rather considering the occasional “telling” interludes of the 
teacher. Used in this way, the method has the advantages 
of clearness, emphasis, and economy for the learner. The 
teacher can simplify and adapt an important idea of a text- 
book or a bit of supplementary reading. She can enliven it 
with all the emphasis that voice and gesture and expression 
may lend to the presentation of an idea; she can make cold 
print glow with the warmth of understanding and convic- 
tion. There is a further incidental advantage, apart from 
the subject-matter learning. The pupils in the elementary 
and high schools should hear more good language than they 
ordinarily do. Language mastery is a matter more largely 
of ear imitation than we have suspected. Correct and ready 
speech must come more fully through ear-training than 
through reading or the learning of rules. These are but 
auxiliaries, that have been too greatly emphasized in correct 
speech control. 
As compared with the question-and-answer method, tell- 
ing in a well-organized form is far less wasteful, and should 
be employed whenever a very clear or an effective impres- 
sion is essential. The responses of even the best pupil to the 
teacher’s questions are not always to the point; they often 
introduce irrelevancies; they often involve incompleteness 
or even introduce entirely erroneous ideas. All such re- 
sponses may, and often do, involve digressions in which the 
main issue may be clouded or lost altogether. 
Planning summaries. One of the most effective pieces of 
“lecture” work a teacher can do, even in the elementary 
grades, is to prepare a concise summary for each lesson, as a
-P-A-G-E-273
THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 259 
final clinching of a period of learning. In most cases this 
can be prepared in connection with the lesson planning. 
If the summary must develop from a discussion, the prepa- 
ration can be going on thoughtfully in the teacher’s mind as 
the work of the period proceeds. 
Assignment: Make out a lesson plan, based on a particular sec- 
tion of work in a textbook, so as to show topics for topical 
recitations to be given by pupils, and several topics with ap- 
propriate outlines for brief supplementary “lectures” you 
would give. Also give the outline for a “summarizing lec- 
ture” you would give for the whole section. 
8. The discussion period 
Purpose an important factor. From the point of view of 
the teacher the instruction aim, and from the point of view 
of the pupils the learning aim, are practically the only things 
that will distinguish the discussion period from the recita- 
tion-testing activity. The testing purpose is entirely absent, 
and the pupils should understand it so. If the discussion is 
on the textbook, the books may, and probably will, be open. 
There will be the same devices of questioning by the teacher, 
of some explanatory and supplementary “lecturing,” possi- 
bly of topical recitation. There will also be questioning of 
the teacher by the pupils, and probably reading aloud by 
individuals or silently by the group, of selected sentences or 
paragraphs to be discussed. Such an exercise may be in- 
tended to clarify a difficult assignment, preliminary to fur- 
ther individual study by the members of the class, or it may 
be intended for the study itself —a sort of codperative, 
directed study. 
This type of discussion period may be used in connection 
with various other general methods, or it may be thought of 
as a general method of instruction to be followed from day 
to day as a distinctive type. The class discussion, directed
-P-A-G-E-274
    260 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
by the teacher, is a common phase of the inductive-develop- 
ment method, and all of the activities suggested in the pre- 
vious paragraph, notably the question-and-answer device, 
may be used in each of the five formal steps of the induction. 
In fact, it may be said that the inductive-development les- 
son is really a discussion lesson, following an inductive out- 
line of progress in its arrangement. 
The class discussion method is also a useful form for re- 
view lessons, either of the recall and fixing type, or of the 
reorganizing type. In such review discussions the topical 
recitation may have a more prominent place. Summa- 
ries and outlines by the teacher and pupils should also be 
stressed. Considerable independence of judgment in the 
evaluation of topics may be thrown upon the pupils in such 
discussions. 
Use of judgment-forming discussions. The discussion 
method will also be well adapted to exercises which are in- 
tended to form opinions or attitudes, rather than the learn- 
ing of subject-matter, notably in such connections as the 
study of current events, or the evaluation of conduct in the 
study of literature and history. In such cases a common ex- 
perience or a common knowledge of facts is assumed for all 
members of the class, and this foundation is laid in the early 
part of the class period, or by assigned preliminary reading. 
In such circumstances the teacher can exercise her most 
important influence over the minds of her pupils, not in the 
way of forcing her own opinions or evaluations in politics, 
economics, and literature on the pupils, but in training them 
to form their own judgments, by reflection and conversa- 
tion, from the facts. In the matter of thinking out problems, 
and suspending judgment, all of the technique of thinking 
that has been discussed in the chapters on supervised study 
(especially pages 96-105) and on the problem method 
(pages 164-168) may be employed. While getting at facts
-P-A-G-E-275
THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 261 
and opinion by the conversational phases, the pupil will 
have an opportunity for training in courtesy, codperation, 
tolerance, and other social attitudes that will be discussed 
more fully in the next section dealing with the socialized 
recitation. ' 
Dangers in desultory discussion. In connection with the 
discussion method of instruction there is considerable danger 
of aimless, desultory conversation, or of wandering from the 
particular topic in hand. Where the discussion is going on 
for purposes of assignment, or for clarifying the textbook in 
a directed-study period, the concrete presence of the subject- 
matter, with its natural demands for steady progression, 
prevents any considerable temptation to wandering. In 
some of the other discussion periods, though, notably those 
intended for reviews and for the development of opinion and 
judgments, there is considerable danger of this wasteful 
side-tracking. In university and high-school classes espe- 
cially, students are tempted to take advantage of leading 
discussions into digression far from the main issue. Where 
the period has no testing aim, the danger of these excursions 
as a willful distraction is diminished, but even in purely in- 
structional periods, the teacher must guard against the tend- 
ency to examine side-issues which soon run into the irrel- 
evant. The variety of needs, interests, and experiences of 
the pupils makes this a natural difficulty, and the main line 
of discussion must be resumed the instant the teacher be- 
comes aware of digressions that destroy the plan or progress 
of the class work on the main issue. 
Further, the teacher must judge constantly as to the most 
effective and economical method of imparting the instruction 
involved in a lesson planned for the discussion method. 
There is no virtue in the question-and-answer extraction of 
vague impressions, or unorganized experiences from a num- 
ber of pupils, if the particular idea can be presented in a few
-P-A-G-E-276
    262 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
sentences by the teacher, or by a more deliberate topical 
recitation by some specially prepared pupil. On the other 
hand, the latter devices may be more economical of time in 
some circumstances but far less effective and educative than 
the questioning process, if the aim is individual reflection 
and evaluation. A teacher may lay down her own opinion 
on a political problem in a few words, when it may be far 
more important for the pupils to argue and think about it, 
even though they consume the whole period for the exercise. 
., Assignment: Make out a lesson plan for a discussion lesson that 
* will provide for the varied activities by teacher and pupils that 
have been suggested in the entire section devoted to the dis- 
cussion method. 
The technique of questioning. Perhaps the most constant 
and most important phase of the discussion period is the use 
of questions and answers. Since the use of these for oral 
testing purposes was condemned as wasteful (pages 10-13), 
the principles involved in the intelligent and effective use of 
questioning were not discussed in that connection. Their 
use for teaching instead of testing will considerably modify 
the questioning technique, and this should, therefore, be 
taken up in this connection. 
Bagley has given us a well-organized summary of prin- 
ciples that should be observed in questioning:! 
(a) The function of the question . . . is to direct attention to the 
salient features of the text. That it may not distract the attention 
from essential to non-essential points, the question should be: (1) 
definite, that is, limited to a particular fact that the lesson brings 
out; and (2) unequivocal, that is, admitting but one correct answer. 
(b) The question should be so framed that the answer will fulfill, 
as far as possible, the conditions of efficient recall. This demands 
that the question should, as a rule, demand an answer in judgment 
form, for a clear formulation of experience in judgment is a power- 
1 Bagley, W. C., The Educative Process, pages 324-25.
-P-A-G-E-277
THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 263 
ful factor in promoting retention and recall. For this reason, ques- 
tions are to be avoided that: (1) imply the answer (“leading ques- 
tions’’); (2) permit of answer by “yes” or “no”; or (8) can be 
answered with single words. (2) and (8) are subject to many quali- 
fications, and are not to be followed dogmatically. It is pedantry 
...to banish all questions that can be answered by yes and no. 
We need only to be sure that sufficient reason follows or sufficient 
experience precedes the answer. In other words, the yes or no 
should not be a fortunate or unfortunate guess. 
Can questions be classified? Various efforts have been 
made by students of method to classify questions into differ- 
ent types. Such classifications and the effort to define the 
various types have as yet contributed little to the technique 
of question-making, largely because the nature of a question 
is so largely determined by a specific situation, involving 
such elements as the nature of the subject-matter dealt with, 
the type of pupil to which the question is put, the relation of 
the question to the immediately preceding discussion, and 
the purpose of the teacher in her plans for the period. All of 
these elements may enter in in various degrees with the 
range of the question, from a very general problematic sort 
to the very specific question calling for a single fact. 
Of these elements entering into a questioning situation, 
perhaps the one that will give us the best point of departure 
for a classification will be the purpose of the teacher. The 
difference in purpose between a testing question and a 
thought-stimulating question is evident, yet the very same 
question might serve either purpose. The question, “Why 
did Washington choose to cross the Delaware under such un- 
favorable conditions?” may be a problematic question if 
used in a study-guide, or a discussion lesson, or it may be a 
memory or testing question if given in a recitation, or re- 
view, or examination, if the pupil has previously studied a 
discussion of the incident in his textbook. Again, if this 
incident were used in the discussion of a more general pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  
264 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
blem, such as, “Why was Washington a great general?” the 
question might be classed as developmental. Under certain 
circumstances the question might be condemned as a 
“catch” or as “misleading,” as, for example, in connection 
with a textbook that brought out the fact that the condi- 
tions were really favorable, when considered from a military 
point of view. It would seem as if we might as well try to 
classify topics used in outlining. Out of this discussion it 
would seem that we might derive a general principle, that 
questions should be so selected and so stated that they will 
serve the particular purpose the teacher has in mind for the 
class period. 
The Monroe-Carter list. However, we may examine 
some of the attempts that have been made at question anal- 
ysis and classification. Monroe and Carter give the follow- 
ing descriptive list 1 of thought questions used in a question- 
naire to get at teaching practices.

  suggested that were only partially included in the above list — 
were:

or 18 and without 1, 7, or 8? Formulate a series of questions  
-P-A-G-E-281
THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 267 
in your major subject, which might serve as illustrations of the 
types, one for each of the twenty types. Do not word any of 
them in the form of “directions” to the student; but use the 
question form. If you cannot do this, answer this question; 
are these all true question types, or are they methods of pupil 
activities in a “recitation,” or in a “discussion” period? Clas- 
sify all the “questions” in this paragraph. 
The fundamental principle in questioning. The funda- 
mental modifying principle that must be kept in mind in 
formulating questions in a discussion period is involved in 
the purpose of such a discussion period. Questions must, 
therefore, have the purpose of stimulating thought or com- 
pelling study, instead of testing knowledge. Since the 
period is a study period, all questions must be intended for, 
and be addressed to, the whole class — not to individuals. 
The need of group attention is more important here than in 
the oral testing period. 
Questions in a discussion period will properly tend to be 
more specific. General questions will occasionally be in 
place, but as a preliminary to a common study of several 
consecutive paragraphs. In case such questions develop 
commonly in the discussion method, all pupils must be made 
to understand that they must attack the reading involved, 
intensively and efficiently. Answers must not be taken 
until the greater part or all of the class have had a chance to 
do the necessary reading. To.“2:cept an answer from one of 
the faster pupils, as soon a, uishes, will destroy the value 
of the study for the major: i the class. 
For this reason, general questions and long silent reading 
periods should be infrequent. Time for a hurried skimming 
of the whole section to be coygred during the period may be 
taken at the beginning of riod, the reading being cen- 
tered around some general Qanizing problem, the answer 
to which may be kept in res ve for the final summary, near 
   
-P-A-G-E-282
  268 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
the close of the period. If such a problem can be set for a 
lesson it will serve to give a fundamental unity to the whole 
discussion; the initial skimming will also help pupils find par- 
ticular passages more readily as the discussion proceeds in a 
more detailed way. Some lesson units will permit of the 
class period’s being divided into a series of such sections. 
4. The socialized recitation 
Meaning of the term. The socialized recitation should 
perhaps rather be called the socialized discussion. In gen- 
eral we may say that this method, recently developed and 
one of the favorites among progressive teachers, is quite 
like the discussion period that has just been explained, with 
the exception that the conduct of the discussion has largely 
been transferred from the teacher to the group itself, and 
that, consequently, it has certain additional social purposes 
or results that must be taken into consideration. We shall 
have to retain the term, socialized recitation, however, be- 
cause it has been in use for a sufficient time, and with a gen- 
eral understanding as to the procedure involved, so that a 
modification now will not be warranted. 
In general, the aim of the socialized recitation, as in the 
teacher-directed discussion, is not testing, but learning. As 
a device for testing it would be even more inefficient and 
wasteful than a similar exercise conducted by the teacher, 
but as a learning period the socialized recitation differs from 
the teacher-directed discuss} riod in that certain addi- 
tional social values are invo as the term itself implies. 
It is a discussion that is socialized because its aim is social- 
izing. Pupils are to acquire certain social skills and atti- 
tudes which cannot be devel-ygod »nder the more formal dis- 
cussion led by the teacher. ore, there is an implica- 
tion and a possibility that the§focializing values are of such 
importance that the method n#ty be advisable to use, more
-P-A-G-E-283
THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 269 
or less frequently, even though it may not be as effective for 
subject-matter learning as the discussions controlled by the 
mature expert in instruction. 
The socialized recitation and the socialized curriculum. 
Before proceeding with a detailed discussion of the socialized 
recitation, its method of organization, purposes and values, 
and its dangers, we must clear away a common misunder- 
standing and confusion that has arisen in connection with it. 
This is the confusion in the minds of some teachers that the 
socialized method is necessarily related to, or is even iden- 
tical with the socialized curriculum. As far as any relation 
is involved it merely lies in the fact of an identity in aims. 
Both intend to improve the pupil’s fitness to meet social 
needs, but the preparation given by the content of the 
course of study should be thought of as quite independent in 
general of the method of instruction used. Different teach- 
ers in the same system may have the same course of study. 
Whether this is archaic or whether it has been wisely ad- 
justed to modern social needs, is, as a rule, no necessary 
factor in their methods. One may select the socialized reci- 
tation throughout the semester, another supervised study, 
and the third may pursue the primitive rut of recitation- 
testing. The confusion of these two distinct phases of edu- 
cation, which have a socializing ideal as their basis, has been 
increased by the adoption of elements from both in the more 
recent movement to reorganize all school work, subject- 
matter as well as method, by the new unit of “projects.” 
The concept of the socialized curriculum as a separate 
problem may be expanded a bit more fully to show its dis- 
tinction from the question of methods. Bobbitt, in his 
epoch-making book on The Curriculum, dealing especially 
with its social needs and socializing values, points out this 
distinction. In general his discussion shows that, while the 
technique of curriculum making along scientific lines has de-
-P-A-G-E-284
  270 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
veloped but little up to the present time, schools are experi- 
menting in order to determine what the socialized curriculum 
should be. As yet the controlling purpose of education is 
not sufficiently particularized; however, a few outstanding 
points seem evident. 
Life, and the social method. First, the fact that life con- 
sists in the performance of specific activities leads to the con- 
clusion that education must prepare for specific activities. 
Just what they are must be determined by searching out in 
real life the attitudes, habits, appreciations, and forms of 
knowledge men need. This must be done by the expert cur- 
riculum maker who makes a thorough study of every phase 
of the social life of the community. He must go into the 
homes and determine the need; he must become thoroughly 
familiar with all kinds of industrial life in which the com- 
munity is interested; he should know the churches, the clubs, 
and all other social organizations. The environment should, 
as far as possible, be such that, as in the Gary system, school 
is like real life with its needs to be met and problems to be 
solved, not in symbol but in reality. The curriculum must 
be a series of experiences by means of which the youth devel- 
ops the ability to do things well, and in which there is a 
clearly defined objective. Of course this objective contin- 
ually changes with new experiences. The objective which in 
the lower grades must be immediate, becomes more and 
more remote with the development of the pupil. The draw- 
ing up of appropriate studies as a means of affording oppor- 
tunity for these experiences is the work of the curriculum 
maker, who must be an analyst of human nature and of 
human affairs. 
We may now note the relation of method to this problem 
of content. Though a socialized curriculum or some of the 
other elements of the socialized school may not exist, a 
teacher can make use of the outstanding principles of mod-

ern social educational ideals and introduce in her methods 
the activities that are social in their nature. The social 
method implies opportunity for initiative, spontaneity, in- 
dividuality, reasoning, and responsibility on the part of 
pupils, as well as placing the emphasis on the group rather 
than on the individual pupil. Groups may undertake the 
solution of definite problems and by research, by investiga- 
tion, and by the free interchange of ideas, may arrive at con- 
clusions which may be announced in a more or less formal 
way before the class. 
The socialized recitation, when conducted with a con- 
scious recognition of its possibilities, affords one of the best 
opportunities for showing that there are other, and perhaps 
more important elements in a child’s education than getting 
facts from books and being tested on them in order that he 
may be marked and graded. The socialized recitation is a 
recognition of the need of a child’s being trained in atti- 
tudes, especially in attitudes affecting his social relation- 
ships, as well as his being informed on a socially useful 
content.! 
Organizing the socialized recitation. The teacher who is 
contemplating an experiment with the socialized method will 
do well to make the transition from the conventional recita- 
tion lesson to the socialized type by way of the discussion 
method, as outlined in the previous general section of this 
chapter. It will probably be helpful to the ultimate success 
of the plan to take the pupils into confidence as to the ulti- 
mate intention of turning the class over to them. Also have 
them understand that the testing purpose is abandoned in 
the discussion and socialized lessons, except when specific

planation as the socialized method has in a little volume of less than one 
hundred pages, by Charles L. Robbins, entitled: The Socialized Recitation. 
Considerable use has been made of this monograph in the following sections.  
-P-A-G-E-286

preparations are involved, and that then general impres- 
sions of excellent work or failure to contribute are bound to 
be made. After a few periods with the discussion method, it 
may be suggested that voluntary contributions, and phases 
of pupil challenge and questioning of other pupils, or pupil 
answers to pupil questions, may be introduced. When these 
phases of the socialized method have been introduced, the 
final suggestion for pupil organization, leadership, and re- 
sponsibility may be suggested. 
Some simple organization — the use of a pupil chairman, 
or a program committee — may be tried out first, with the 
teacher acting as guide and referee in crises. After several 
periods of this, a critical discussion of the method may be 
taken up with the class, and remedies for undesirable pro- 
cedure may be called for from the pupils or suggested by the 
teacher. Different degrees of complexity in organization 
may be attempted at different levels. Elementary and 
junior high-school pupils will probably be unable to manipu- 
late the machinery of a more complicated form than has al- 
ready been outlined. High-school students may attempt 
more complex parliamentary or institutionalized forms of 
organization. Whatever ultimate form is developed for the 
general conduct of the socialized recitation, the teacher 
should not lose sight of the fact that the ultimate purpose is 
twofold — (a) the learning of subject-matter, and (b) the 
opportunity for all to have a variety of experiences that will 
have a socializing value.! 
Place and work of the teacher in socialized discussions. 
To attain the best results, either from the viewpoint of learn- 
ing or from that of socializing values, the teacher must avoid 
1 An excellent tabular comparison is given in Robbins, The Socialized 
Recitation (page 42), of the distinctive features of the organization, the 
pupils’ activities, and the teacher’s activities, for three different types of 
socialized work — the informal group, the institutionalized group, and the 
self-directing group.
-P-A-G-E-287

two possible extremes of attitude. She must not dominate; 
neither should she be a mere interested or amused spectator. 
If she presides or constantly interrupts, the class exercise is 
hardly different from the directed discussion method, and 
there will be but little opportunity for some of the more im- 
portant socializing activities. If she is a mere spectator, ex- 
cept in very advanced classes, the work of the class may get 
nowhere. Enthusiasts may advocate the value of the class 
extricating itself from tangles, but the work of the day may 
not be sacrificed to the immature confusion that may arise. 
The dangers of such situations will be discussed more fully 
later. 
The teacher’s work will involve careful planning, not only 
with reference to the organization of the class, but also as a 
leader or supervisior of the assignments that are involved. 
There must be a well-thought-out distribution of tasks, to 
give all pupils a chance at the various types of experience 
involved. Supervision or preliminary instruction of a leader 
or committee may be sufficient, and some effort must be 
made to keep such leadership on the part of the teacher 
from being too evident. A sense of responsibility in plan- 
ning the work is one of the possible valuable social experi- 
ences for the pupils. 
During the socialized recitation the teacher must codper- 
ate with the class, as one of their number, as far as possible, 
both in keeping the machinery moving and in making con- 
tributions, or taking part in the discussions on subject- 
matter. The latter must only be offered when no proper 
contribution seems to come from the pupils. It is evident 
that this will involve thorough preparation in the subject- 
matter on the teacher’s part. It is a mistake to organize the 
class and then to assume that they will furnish all necessary 
content, or to be satisfied with whatever happens to be con- 
tributed by the pupils. 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  274 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Occasionally suggestions or directions that will promote 
the progress of the discussion, or that will defer the discus- 
sion of some topic for further reference, may be required. 
Variety of pupil activities in the socialized period. The 
socialized organization of class discussion will involve a 
variety of activities and experiences for the pupils. If the 
method is used at all extensively, the planning should in- 
volve as wide a distribution of these experiences as possible. 
These activities involve the social values that lie in the use 
of the method. At this point the activities will only be 
enumerated and briefly described; the values of the method 
will be taken up more fully in a following section. 
a. Planning. This will usually be in some form of pro- 
gram committee work, in consultation with the teacher, 
except for advanced pupils. ‘This will involve the assign- 
ment of individual tasks if such contributions constitute a 
part of the plan. 
b. Presiding or conducting. Some pupil will act as chair- 
man in a more or less formal manner, depending on the com- 
plexity of the organization, or will take the part usually 
taken by the teacher in a discussion period. 1 
c. Individual contributions, on assigned topics. These will 
usually be in the nature of topical recitations on selected 
items of the general assignment, or on individual supple- 
mentary reading. 
d. Voluntary supplementary contributions. These may be 
offered by pupils on the basis of individual experience or 
general reading, that is, not specially assigned reading, on 
the topics reported on by other members under item ¢, or 
on phases of the general discussions that develop 
e. Challenging or questioning another pupil’s statements. 
Questions for further information, for source or reliability of 
information, or the presentation of rebuttal material. 
f. Correction, criticism, approval, or confirmation. If the
-P-A-G-E-289
  
  THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 275 
discussion becomes general and continues for some time, the 
group will begin to take sides on debatable questions, and an 
informal argument may draw many into the discussion with 
activities of the type named. 
g. Summarizing. This activity must be carefully planned 
by the teacher. It should be suggested as desirable to 
leaders or committees to present or provide for such sum- 
maries, either as their own function, or as particular assign- 
ments; or the pupils should, perhaps preferably, understand 
that any one may be called on to do this. This summarizing 
phase is one of the most important from the learning point 
of view, and is too commonly neglected in the socialized 
exercises. 
Assignments for a socialized period. There will usually 
be two types of assignments for the socialized discussion. 
The teacher, or the planning committee, must, above all, be 
sure that the class will have a common core of knowledge 
about the problem or subject to be discussed. The social- 
ized recitation, like the directed discussion period, may 
profitably be used for review lessons. In this case the com- 
mon knowledge may be presupposed, but if the method is to 
be used on some new material, there will be the necessity for 
all making some preparation. This should be as complete as 
for a class exercise of any other type. In order to insure 
participation by pupils in the way of volunteer contribu- 
tions, challenge, questioning, correction, criticism, etc., such 
a common core of information will be absolutely essential. 
The second type of assignment is of the individual collateral 
reading for the special contributions to be made. 
5. Values of the socialized recitation 
Gives a social motive. The method gives a social motive 
to the work of the pupils. There is a feeling in the pupils 
that preparation and activity are contributions of value to 
   
-P-A-G-E-290
  276 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
the members of the group, instead of a formal exercise to be 
presented to a teacher who already knows what is presented 
and is imagined to know very much more. There is the 
natural stimulus of evaluation and criticism, if not ex- 
pressed, just as surely felt, by the child’s peers — not by a 
superior who has no other function than that of judging and 
testing. Occasionally a teacher may have an air of sym- 
pathetic and genuine interest in the child’s thoughts and 
activities, and may inspire confidences about play and life, 
but even such personality can hardly function as a “natural- 
auditor” situation for academic activities. 
The preparation of work and participation in the social- 
ized recitation ceases to be a perfunctory, artificial exercise. 
The value of this natural-audience situation is a powerful 
motivation in oral and written expression work. The so- 
cialized recitation offers large opportunity for oral expres- 
sion of a slightly different type, the large-group formal con- 
versation, and it offers a proper motivation as well as a 
proper control for the necessary amenities involved, as will 
appear presently. 
Develops a group consciousness. The social recitation 
develops group consciousness. It puts the pupil’s work and 
attitudes under contribution to group loyalties and codpera- 
tion, and arouses a consciousness of common interests and 
common needs which all can serve. The ideals of loyalty and 
codperation are available and probably impressive, for every 
member of the group, in the very conditions of the socialized 
recitation. Each is challenged to do his part, or the success 
of the whole undertaking is affected, the work of the whole 
group is hampered. It is not a mere question now of the 
individual’s own record in the teacher’s class-book. It is a 
question of the success of a joint undertaking in learning. 
This stimulus to codperation will be promoted as much by 
the spirit of group loyalty, which is natural, as by the feeling
-P-A-G-E-291
THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION Qr7 
of fear of group criticism and disapproval if the responsibil- 
ities are not faithfully met. 
While codperation has an almost instinctive basis, it is 
equally true that this tendency can be atrophied by lack of 
exercise, or can be highly developed by practice and experi- 
ence. Franklin tells an interesting anecdote in his Autobi- 
ography of how he got a great man’s friendship by getting 
him to do a favor, the lending of a book. Social friendliness 
can be developed in the same way; one’s community be- 
comes his if he serves it in some way, much more certainly 
than if he can derive some service from the group. Such com- 
munity service can be developed in the class group, and a 
feeling of satisfaction in codperative service can be engen- 
dered that will become a permanent attitude. 
In this quality, codperation, and in the one to be discussed 
next, leadership, we have the great fundamental needs for 
success in a democracy. The socialized recitation is a demo- 
cratic substitute for the ordinary autocratic situation in the 
schoolroom, and whatever values the recitation may have in 
the way of opportunities for training in these civic virtues 
should commend it to the teacher for experiment. In pro- 
gressing with it, and in trying to perfect it from its earlier 
crude stages, this chance for training in codperation, in group 
loyalty, should constantly stand as one of the conscious aims 
of the teacher. 
Training in leadership and in initiative. The socialized 
recitation gives an opportunity for training and development 
of leadership and initiative. Such opportunities are too un- 
common in the schoolroom situation to be neglected. The 
presence of adult authority is necessary, but it has been so 
obtrusive as to develop a variety of undesirable attitudes in 
both the best and the worst types of children. On the one 
hand the schoolroom situation has bred a regrettable docil- 
ity, on the other a still more regrettable spirit of evasion and 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  278 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
defiance. The military type of teacher has not altogether 
disappeared; the necessity of domination and discipline still 
haunts us, and unavoidably so to a large degree. The school- 
room is an artificial form of group organization; autocratic 
government is its most natural solution. Recent attempts 
to supplant it by freedom, especially in certain types of 
kindergarten and primary classes, have often led to chaos 
and near anarchy. The socialized recitation seems to offer a 
happy medium for at least a part of the day’s work. This 
solution lies partly in the feature of the teacher’s sharing the 
responsibility of authority with selected pupil-leaders, and 
partly in placing the responsibility for self-control and co- 
operation on the whole group. The former concerns us spe- 
cially in this section. 
Such activities as planning, presiding, leading in discus- 
sion, giving summaries, and committee work, or activities as 
an officer in the more complicated forms of socialized organ- 
ization, are experiences which must be provided in the 
period covered by school training. There is perhaps an ad- 
ditional value in the fact that such leadership activities 
come in connection with the day’s work. This should offer 
a more valuable background for these activities than can be 
found in the volunteer literary societies, clubs, and sim- 
ilar play and extra-curricular activities. 
Wasted ability in our schools. While opportunities for 
such leadership should be as widely and as impartially dis- 
tributed as any of the class activities, such training in leader- 
ship will have special value for two types of pupils — the 
capable docile child, and the exceptionally bright child. One 
dealing with advanced students, in high school and univer- 
sity, cannot help but regret the waste of human ability the 
schools are guilty of in connection with these two valuable 
social types. One’s greatest regret in a teacher-training 
school, where many young women of exceptional ability in
-P-A-G-E-293
  
  THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 279 
scholarship give but small promise of success in teaching, is 
due to this spirit of meek and modest docility, this lack of 
self-confidence and self-reliance that are such vital qualities 
for success in instruction. Such docility is largely a product 
of training, in fact the word itself implies that it is the atti- 
tude most desirable for instruction purposes. It is not an 
attitude desirable for success in life. 
The other type of ability that is wasted, exceptional men- 
tality, is wasted in another way, and results in a far less use- 
ful product. The neglected near-genius, capable of large 
service in social leadership, because it is never challenged to 
do its best and is never practiced in its superior abilities for 
leadership, is atrophied into the loafer or distorted into the 
“bluffer” or the trickster who relies on his “smartness” as 
a substitute for work. The socialized method is one of the 
best situations to-day offered in the schools for utilizing and 
properly developing and directing these two valuable types 
of ability. The principle of impartial assignment may be 
materially stretched to give to such the opportunities they 
need and deserve. 
AsstcNMENt: Write a short paper on the question, Is it demo- 
cratic to give opportunities for special training or exercise to 
pupils of special ability in the public schools? 
Training in courtesy and consideration. For all in the 
group the socialized method gives a natural opportunity for 
training in courtesy and consideration. One of the fine arts 
that one reads such idealistic accounts of in fiction, and so 
rarely meets in real life, is the fine art of conversation, 
either in small-group or large-group forms. One wonders 
how much fiction there is about the dinner conversations of 
fiction, and how much history there is about the salons and 
levees of history. Conversation may have become one of the 
lost arts, like the art of letter-writing with the advent of the
-P-A-G-E-294
280 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
picture postcards. If it has been lost, it should be revived; 
if it is still really in the stage of development, education owes 
that development a duty. 
A true conversation can never be developed, nor can train- 
ing in the art be promoted in the artificial situations of 
teacher and pupil, the mature autocrat and the immature 
“subject.” Conversation and discussion demand a group 
setting, with a minimum of formality, and an equal freedom 
to participate, a freedom limited only by courtesy and con- 
sideration. Such elements as interested listening, waiting 
one’s turn, contributing when possible, toleration and open- 
mindedness, are all essentials in the art of small-group con- 
versation or large-group discussion. Such courtesies and 
attitudes are brought out in all only by experience, and the 
training may well begin as early as the other forms of ex- 
pression, writing or speaking to an audience. The social- 
ized recitation, when properly organized, offers splendid op- 
portunities for just such training, and, even if such class ex- 
ercises were ineffective as a method of learning subject- 
matter, their occasional use would be fully justified for this 
purpose alone. 
But this purpose must be served, even though none of the 
other values are insured. If the socialized recitation cannot 
be so conducted as to observe the courtesies necessary for the 
interchange of ideas, it should not be continued at all. If it 
becomes a period of indiscriminate babbling, of confused 
contradiction, of resentful and resented criticism, of aimless 
altercation, the evil effects will outweigh any planning, 
preparation, or learning that might incidentally be involved 
for a few. 
Lends a play-interest to learning. As a final value it may 
be pointed out that the socialized recitation lends a play- 
interest to the learning period, or rather that it eliminates 
the formal academic atmosphere of the usual schoolroom
-P-A-G-E-295
    THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 281 
situation. It offers one of the best opportunities for realiz- 
ing the ideal that the school should be real life or like real 
life. It gives the democratic organization to the group in the 
place of the autocratic. It substitutes the method of learn- 
ing by the interchange of ideas with one’s peers for the learn- 
ing for a task-master. All of this has the charm of novelty 
and good-natured play for the average group, and is wel- 
comed as a change from the formal situation. 
6. Difficulties and dangers in the socialized recitation 
Lack of system and organization. Turning over the class 
period to the pupils involves some difficulties and dangers 
that must be thoughtfully guarded against. The first and 
most common of these is a lack of system and organization, 
resulting in desultory discussion, in futile rambling, in lapses 
and halts, and in a lack of thoroughness and progress in 
learning. Such a situation is likely to develop if the class is 
plunged into the new experiment without complete planning 
and a careful explanation of the method in advance. A 
gradual approach to it through the teacher-conducted dis- 
cussion period has also been advised, as well as considerable 
participation by the teacher in the earlier stages of such 
work. Such difficulties, when they arise, should be pointed 
out and discussed with the class. Pupils should be made to 
understand that the responsibility of overcoming these diffi- 
culties must rest on them, if the experiment is to be a success. 
If, with a particular group, there seems to be no inclina- 
tion to solve this difficulty, and especially if there seems to 
be a tendency to take advantage of the situation and a 
spirit of making light of it, as will sometimes be found, the 
method would better be abandoned. The socialized recita- 
tion is, at this point, open to the same objection that is 
found in experiments in student self-government. Such a 
pupil organization cannot be substituted for the autocratic
-P-A-G-E-296
  282 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
form of government, if the latter is itself weak and ineffec- 
tive. A poor teacher can no more succeed with the social- 
ized method than a poor principal can succeed with a stu- 
dent government scheme. In fact, the failure will probably 
be more marked if, under such circumstances, the responsi- 
bility is thrown upon the students. It will merely give a 
larger chance for them to take advantage, if the spirit of 
respect and codperation is not present already. 
However, such a condition must not be confused with the 
elements of freedom and enthusiasm that are certain to de- 
velop under the most successful forms of the socialized reci- 
tation. If the purpose of learning is being met, some noise 
and confusion may be as permissible as it is natural. The 
strict militarist should not undertake the socialized exercise; 
the best developments of eagerness will not conform with 
her ideas of orderliness and discipline. The spirit and intent 
of the pupils must determine the difference between a free 
and successful codperation in learning and willful disturb- 
ance. 
Assertive pupils may dominate. A second danger lies in 
the tendency of a few assertive or capable pupils to dominate 
the period. The inclination in pupil committees and chair- 
men to give such more than a fair share of the individual 
assignments, and to give them the floor too often in the dis- 
cussions, is as natural a mistake for them as for the teacher 
in regular recitation work. Especially in the discussions 
will the more enthusiastic and talkative pupils tend to assert 
themselves. Reciprocally, there is the danger of complete 
non-participation by the slow or the reticent pupils. To a 
large degree this must be anticipated in the planning, but 
this may only provide for equalizing the work on the more 
formal individual reports. The chairmen and the class gen- 
erally should be shown this difficulty and should be urged to 
draw the backward into the discussions, just as a clever,
-P-A-G-E-297
  
THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 288 
thoughtful hostess will try to draw all her guests into a con- 
versation. The teacher’s participation, and occasional inter- 
ference, should also be directed to overcoming this difficulty 
if it becomes too prominent. Unless this difficulty can be 
progressively overcome, by such plans and by appeals for 
more general participation and codperation, the socialized 
period should not be given a large place in the week’s pro- 
gram of methods. 
May be wasteful of time. It must also be admitted that 
the socialized recitation is wasteful of time, when viewed 
merely from the point of view of the efficient learning of 
subject-matter. If it were to be judged by this learning 
result alone, there would be little to justify it. But the 
socializing values must also be considered. Every one is 
entitled to an opinion as to the relative importance of these 
two values, but no one can deny the importance of some 
training in the social values involved. 
This difficulty of waste of time has been strikingly pointed 
out by Robbins. He says:! 
It cannot be denied that when the process of socialization is 
added to that of mastering subject-matter there is need for great 
economy of time during the class period. Otherwise each day will 
find the class handicapped because of failure to cover the materials 
that properly belonged to that day’s work. The need of develop- 
ing a sense of the value of time is further emphasized by the fact 
that in any kind of group activity, individual waste is multiplied by 
the number in the group. When the individual is alone and wastes 
five minutes, the loss is just that. But if in a class of twenty he 
wastes five minutes of class time, the total is twenty times five. 
The method may be overworked. This condition leads to 
another danger that lies in overdoing the socialized method. 
This method should only be an occasional method. The 
point of view has been taken throughout the present discus- 
sion that the socialized exercise is well adapted to review 
1 Robbins, C. L., The Socialized Recitation, pages 88-89.
-P-A-G-E-298
  284 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
work, to dealing with supplementary learning, or to such 
exercises as revolve around the purpose of forming opinions 
and attitudes. The socialized recitation should not be fol- 
lowed as the regular process of class work from day to day; 
it should not be relied on for the bulk of content learning; it 
has little value for drill work. On the other hand, it makes a 
valuable supplement to the supervised-study method, fur- 
nishing just those opportunities for social experiences which 
are quite lost in the supervised-study program. 
Danger of a fixed procedure. A final danger to be avoided 
is a lack of variety in the socialized recitation itself. Pupils 
are too apt to fall into a stereotyped form of procedure. 
This has been well described by Robbins as “perfunctory 
routine.” Pupils read reports in a lifeless way, and no back- 
ground is furnished for enthusiastic discussion and the in- 
formal interchange of ideas. It must not be lost sight of 
that the discussion phase of the socialized recitation is the 
most important of the activities involved, not only because 
it gives the largest chance for free and general participation, 
but also because in the discussion the more important social- 
izing activities find their largest expression. A program 
committee should not be allowed to plan for a series of top- 
ical recitations that will take up the whole period, nor should 
they be of such a nature as to fail to provoke some sort of 
spontaneous reaction in the group.

Purpose of tests and examinations. Final examinations and 
periodical tests, either oral or written, must be thought of as 
serving two distinct purposes. First, as both words imply, 
they are a device for evaluating a pupil’s work or his pro- 
gress; this is the purpose they are most commonly made to 
serve. A second use, their serving as a method of instruc- 
tion, is also occasionally found, and should probably be em- 
phasized much more than it is. The reason for not employ- 
ing them more for teaching purposes is probably to be 
found in the fact that, as usually conducted, tests and exam- 
inations are in disfavor with both pupils and teachers as 
laborious, time-consuming, and, in many other ways, ineffi- 
cient and unsatisfactory. 
As a method of evaluating the pupil’s efforts — that is, 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  290 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
for grading, marking, and promoting purposes — tests and 
examinations serve the incidental purpose of motivating 
much of our school work at present. As such, they are an 
extrinsic form of motivation. Interest lies not in the subject- 
matter of the course itself, but in the comparative marks or 
in the promotion involved. There is, therefore, an appeal to 
instincts of rivalry or of social approval, and, in some cases, 
where there are home sequels to school careers, an appeal 
to the fear of punishment. Such motivation is perfectly 
proper in cases where it is necessary, and it is usually neces- 
sary to make such appeals to extrinsic interest, because 
pupils cannot readily recognize the values of much they 
must learn. Intrinsic interest is, of course, always prefer- 
able, but is not always secured readily enough to make mass 
education go at the rate it must. 
AssIGNMENT: Study carefully Question II, in the Test at the 
end of this chapter. Show that it might be ambiguous — that 
two quite different answers oe be accepted by one who

Types of examinations. Because this motivation forces 
pupils to work, and often to work hard and feverishly for 
special school emergencies, the method of testing has been 
popularly condemned. “Cramming” for examinations, and 
the strain of the examination period itself, especially when 
extended over several hours, has been denounced in popular 
magazines as a barbaric cruelty and a menace to health, as 
well as an improper method of education. Most of such 
denunciation is merely a matter of misplaced sentimental- 
ity; it has no worthy experimental basis, and studies in 
fatigue rather tend to show the dangers have been greatly 
exaggerated. The nervous strain of such strenuous work 
periods may be a severe one on a few pupils in delicate 
health, who should probably not be in the schoolroom at all. 
To argue the case against tests and examinations from such
-P-A-G-E-305
  NEW METHODS IN TESTING 291 
occasional victims is wholly unwarranted, although we may 
take the hint that, if examinations can be shown to be nec- 
essary or even worth while as a school method, improve- 
ments might be undertaken which would remove such pos- 
sible objections. 
It is largely the purpose of this chapter to show that such 
changes can easily be made, and that such modifications will. 
also contribute largely to making tests and examinations 
far more thorough and efficient, far less laborious, and much 
more impartial, objective, and economical of time spent in 
taking or marking them. The solution will lie largely in 
adapting a number of devices that have been evolved by the 
makers of~standardized tests to the regular work of the 
school. Any one who has seen a school group working for a 
half or three quarters of an hour with a standardized intelli- 
gence or educational test, must have been impressed with 
the thoroughness and efficiency that could be introduced 
into school work if similar methods were more largely em- 
ployed. 
Examinations cannot be abolished. The use of tests and 
examinations cannot be discontinued in the public schools. 
Their necessity lies in the demand that the schools shall 
evaluate the abilities and achievements of the pupils. The 
public demands this evaluation. Standings, marks, grades, 
estimates and letters of recommendation are demanded by 
the world from administrators and teachers. The further a 
child advances in school the more importance. we find 
attached to such estimates of ability, work, and attitudes. 
Parents, employers, and each advancing step of the educa- 
tional system itself, demand accurate grading. The present 
system of promotional organization makes such evaluation 
essential. 
There are a number of administrative problems in the 
school besides mere promotion that require as accurate an
-P-A-G-E-306
  292 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
evaluation as can be obtained. When a pupil leaves the 
grammar school and enters junior or senior high school, a 
program of educational and vocational guidance begins to 
be necessary. This involves an accurate estimate of past 
performances, as well as an accounting of interests, atti- 
tudes, and abilities. Then, again, the success of a teacher 
must often be evaluated by a principal or superintendent, 
and one of the few available bases of judgment is the work 
of the pupils. We may have a difference of opinion as to 
how such evaluations of the work of pupils should be made, 
but we cannot deny the necessity of having such evaluations. 
Taking the teacher’s judgment. Some suggest that such 
evaluations should be made on the teacher’s general impres- 
sions of the pupils’ abilities and of their work. Such im- 
pressions as a teacher may have may be of value in propor- 
tion to her experience with children, but there are certain 
disturbing factors that cannot be ignored as sources of 
serious error in making such judgments. Classes are usu- 
ally so large and the period of contact, in departmentalized 
schools usually only a semester, is so short that a satisfac- 
tory estimate cannot be made. The extremes will stand out 
in a group of thirty-five to fifty children; the best and the 
poorest will be known; but the middle fifty per cent of aver- 
age pupils will not be as accurately evaluated as they should 
be. 
Then, again, teachers are naturally too much impressed 
by certain externals, such as general appearance, dress, 
physiognomy, pleasant or disagreeable social qualities, and 
the like. This has been repeatedly shown in comparisons of 
teachers’ estimates of intelligence with standardized test 
results. Moreover, the disciplinary point of view has neces- 
sarily been too prominent; deportmental attitudes of pupils 
have made teachers quite short-sighted about achievements 
as well as abilities. Recent experiences in special rooms
-P-A-G-E-307
  
NEW METHODS IN TESTING 298 
with superior children have shown how unfairly some of 
the disciplinary “problems” have been evaluated. Small 
children are underrated; and often too much is expected of 
large children in a class. If children of superior mental 
ability are kept in “lock step” too long, their tendencies to 
loaf or to engage in undesirable activities in school tend to 
give teachers a prejudice against them which extends even 
to serious underestimation of their real abilities. 
The daily markings. An improved form of this teacher 
judgment-evaluation suggests the importance of daily work 
and daily grades as a basis for estimating pupils. In so far 
as the keeping of such a record is feasible, it should, beyond 
question, be given a high place in evaluating pupils, but the 
feasibility of keeping the record is a considerable objection. 
The method is open to all the objections that have been 
raised (see Chapter I) against the “recitation-testing” 
method of teaching. Such daily, oral testing was shown to 
be highly inefficient and wasteful. The advantage of the 
glib talker and the “bluffing” pupil were also pointed out, 
and now the advantage for such a type adds to the objec- 
tions to daily marking as a basis of ultimate evaluations. 
We may admit the teacher’s personal impressions and 
daily grades as a part of the basis of evaluation, but we can- 
not accept them as the whole basis. There are values in the 
frequent written quiz and final examinations that must be 
conserved, notably the perspective and organization neces- 
sary for mastering and accounting for larger units of work. 
In such aims the test and examination may well be placed 
alongside reviews as an effective method of summarizing 
learning. And they may be used as a most effective way of 
motivating real work in the review itself. 
Use of standardized tests. A third substitute has recently 
been suggested for the old type of examination, the use of 
standardized tests — both intelligence and educational tests. 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  294 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
These have certain advantages over the old type of examin- 
ation and their use is spreading rapidly, but there are also 
certain disadvantages which make too great a reliance on 
them unwise. Ability, as shown by an intelligence test, 
should be a prominent factor in promotion and in the evalu- 
ations the school is called upon to make for other purposes. 
Ability as shown by such testing, though, is not a complete 
evaluation, and, as schools are organized at present, the 
farther advanced a pupil is the more exceptional ability is 
likely to be overlaid by attitudes that must considerably 
modify the evaluation. The tendencies to loaf and rely on 
smartness are often too painfully evident by the time the 
upper grades are reached. When we work out correlations 
between intelligence and performance, it is this group which 
considerably reduces the coefficient of correlation. If we 
work out achievement quotients, this type usually has an 
insufficient numerator of performance to keep the quotient 
at or above 100. 
Using the standardized educational tests as a substitute 
for school tests and examinations has its values for estimat- 
ing the work of a class, or of a teacher, in comparison with 
national standards. The sampling in most of the school 
subjects, though, is too small a part of the subject-matter 
covered to use them as a substitute for the regular and con- 
tinuous evaluation that has to be made. This may be illus- 
trated in arithmetic, one of the best worked fields of stand- 
ardized testing. With the standardized material it is pos- 
sible to get an effective evaluation only of the ability to do 
the fundamental processes with abstract numbers, a little of 
the work in fractions, and a very limited test of the ability 
to work problems involving reasoning. In contrast to this 
field we may point to the very limited beginnings in some of 
the content subjects; for example, United States history. 
Other phases of history work, holding a large place in the
-P-A-G-E-309
  
  NEW METHODS IN TESTING 295 
high-school curriculum, have just been touched. All the 
history tests have little more than the intent and appear- 
ance of a very general “final” examination. Naturally all 
local significance must be ignored in the standardized tests, 
and the instructional emergencies of each teacher and each 
group are not at all met by such tests. 
AsstGNMENT: Illustrate the statements made in the preceding 
paragraphs by making a specific examination of several stand- 
ardized tests, in some particular school subject. Show how 
inadequate these standardized tests would be for the testing a 
teacher would probably want to do in that subject. 
Yet these standardized tests, while limited in their scope 
as related to regular school work, have one decided advan- 
tage over the old type of tests and examinations in their form. 
This form makes them fair, impartial, objective, and eco- 
nomical, thus meeting directly some of the most serious edu- 
cational objections that have been raised against examina- 
tions in the past. 
1. Educational objections to the old form of testing 
Examination-question types. Reference has already been 
made to the popular objection made to tests and examina- 
tions that they involved a severe nervous strain on the pupil, 
both in the preparation for them and in the actual writing. 
The educational objections that can be raised against the old 
type of examination are more serious. Perhaps the type 
should be more clearly described. The written “discus- 
sion” of topics, or extended answers to general questions, 
have until very recently constituted the examination method. 
Usually questions or topics were given that called for some 
organization of thought on the part of the writer. Both 
organization and discussion might range from quite accurate 
recall of learned material, or might involve the free reorgan- 
ization of such material, or the original organization and 
   
-P-A-G-E-310
  296 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
reaction to a new problem related to previous study experi- 
ences. The first of these is the most common type. Fre- 
quently topics or questions are so general that only a chance, 
random phase is discussed, no two papers being at all alike in 
material presented. Sometimes examinations were more 
detailed and exact, and occasionally unimportant details 
were included as “catch” questions. 
A few illustrations may be given of this type of examina- 
tion, using questions which have been used not only for 
school purposes, but for a variety of evaluating activities in | 
everyday life — in examining teachers for certification; in 
selecting candidates for the civil service; and in any field 
where an estimate of an applicant’s knowledge was essential 
for his selection. 
Following are a few sample questions for examinations mn 
English history set for college entrance by some of the lead- 
ing colleges: 
1. How has English history been affected by English geograph- 
ical position and physical features? 
2. The career of Marlborough. 
8. What rank would you give the elder Pitt (Earl of Chatham) 
among the statesmen of England? Justify your opinion by 
a discussion of his public career. 
4. Discuss the ministry of Walpole. 
5. Oliver Cromwell as a statesman. 
In Greek history the following are typical examples of 
college-entrance examinations: 
1. Write an account of the career of Philip of Macedon. 
2. Describe the fortifications and.principal buildings of Athens 
at the time of Pericles. The addition of a sketch-map would 
make the answer more definite. 
8. Give an account of the conflict between Aristides and The- 
mistocles. 
4. Describe the government, institutions, and mode of life in 
Sparta.
-P-A-G-E-311
    NEW METHODS IN TESTING 2907 
5. Give some account of the Hellenic migrations; of the degree 
of civilization in prehistoric Greece. 
Such examinations merely samplings. This is apparent 
from even a casual examination of the type of questions 
asked. They attempt to mitigate this necessity by making 
the samples so broad and general as to admit of some attack 
by almost any degree of ability or acquaintance with the sub- 
ject-matter. They give an advantage to the ready writer to 
which he is possibly entitled, if the examination is intended 
to be one in composition ability or a test of speed in hand- 
writing. A premium is placed on quantity, regardless of 
quality of thought. The most experienced teacher will 
admit this as a problem in reading “discussion” papers. 
Many likewise will admit the inevitable effect of such inci- 
dentals as general neatness and quality of handwriting in 
grading such papers. 
Such tests not economical of time. An unwarranted pro- 
portion of class time is taken up if the testing is to be fre- 
quent and extensive enough to get a satisfactory estimate 
of the pupils’ attainments in any subject. The wastage, 
though, is probably still more serious when considered from 
the teacher’s point of view. If discussion tests are given 
often enough, and are of sufficient length to give pupils a 
reasonable chance to show what they have learned, the 
teacher is burdened with the drudgery of reading intermin- 
able compositions in connection with almost every course. 
The hours spent on such monotonous tasks might well be 
devoted to better uses, if the same results in the way of 
testing can be secured by more economical means. This can 
now be done. The devices for getting exact responses, so 
that a large number of papers can be graded in a very short 
time, have been brought to a high state of perfection in the 
standardized tests. Further, this economy in marking can 
readily be adapted to all manner of tests in any subject, as
-P-A-G-E-312
  298 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
will be shown in detail in the description of these devices 
presently. 
The time usually spent by the teacher in scoring papers 
may be much more profitably and agreeably spent in plan- 
ning and preparing the test, so that it may be efficient, 
economical, thorough, and objective. Too often the dis- 
cussion test is made up on the spur of the moment, with 
little regard to the relative values and the important aims of 
the course. Some teachers even pride themselves on this 
spontaneous random “sampling” as a good method to insure 
impartiality. They do not want to know their own exam- 
ination and test questions in advance. They do not want 
to “give away” the important points by too conscious a 
stress in their teaching. They have a contempt for a teacher 
who will give pupils a set of test questions in advance. 
There is, though, far more good pedagogy in the latter prac- 
tice, if it is intended as a frank list of the important things a 
pupil should know in the course. 
Discussion tests not fair and impartial. This is because 
they are not objective enough to admit of accurate and con- 
sistent scoring. This is the most serious charge that can be 
brought against the “discussion” type of examination. 
There are several elements involved in their subjective char- 
acteristics. 
A test is said to be objective when practically the same 
scores or results are secured if the same test is given to the 
same group by different teachers, and if the scoring is also 
done by them. How widely teachers vary in their estima- 
tion or scoring of the same paper has been shown by a num- 
ber of experimental studies. One of the earliest of these has 
become a classic in showing how prominent the personal 
equation is in grading the same paper. Starch and Elliott? 
sent out several examination papers, two in English, one in 
1 Starch, D., Educational Psychology, pages 433-34.
-P-A-G-E-313
  NEW METHODS IN TESTING 299 
geometry, and one in American history, to teachers of these 
subjects. Of 142 English teachers who marked one English 
paper, the marks ran all the way from 64 to 98, and on the 
second paper from 50 to 98. The range of 114 mathematics 
teachers who marked the geometry paper was from 28 to 92, 
and the grades on the history paper by 70 teachers ranged 
from 43 to 90. 
Objectivity is sometimes attained in tests and examina- 
tions in school work. A spelling test is almost absolutely 
objective, if only spelling is marked, and if credit is given 
only for correct spelling. Any two teachers would have to 
agree exactly in scoring the same paper. Similarly, an 
arithmetic test is very objective, if only answers are marked 
correct or incorrect. If the process is considered, or if credit 
is given if most of the work is correct, the marking then be- 
comes more or less subjective. 
Such evidence of subjectivity in marking examination 
papers need not be accepted by any teacher who is at all 
sceptical. She may try the experiment on herself with a 
group of “discussion” examination papers, grading them 
several weeks apart, indicating the grades given each time 
on a separate sheet of paper, and then comparing results. 
Factors in the test itself will thus be eliminated. If the 
papers be identified only by a series of figures which would 
make the writers unknown to the teacher, and if they be 
typewritten to eliminate the influence of neatness and legi- 
bility, the results would probably be convincing enough. 
The conditions in the scorer that cause this fluctuation are 
many and various — health, fatigue, mental states, the place 
of a paper near the beginning or end of a bundle — all con- 
tribute to the subjective phase. If different persons, affected 
differently by all these elements, grade the tests, the per- 
sonal equation appears still more prominently. 
Again, in a discussion test, a teacher will have very sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
ee 
300 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
jective evaluations as to the importance of particular facts 
or elements in the exercise, or very different standards of 
what is acceptable. This was shown strikingly in the 
Starch-Elliott experiment. 
AssIGNMENT: Let a committee of three or five score a set of your 
class papers of the discussion type, as outlined in the above 
paragraphs, and compare results. Have the same committee 
score the papers again after a few weeks, and compare results 
again with the previous grades. 
Degrees of failure not revealed. Another weakness usu- 
ally found in the traditional discussion examinations is the 
failure of teachers to recognize adequately the different 
degrees of failure in their pupils. Usually the percentage 
basis of evaluation is followed, with seventy or seventy-five 
per cent as the lowest passing mark. When papers are 
graded under this system a failure is commonly marked just 
below, but not too discouragingly below, the passing mark. 
The relative rating of pupils with their more successful 
classmates is abandoned. The twenty and thirty per cent 
pupils are lumped with the fifties and sixties. 
Then, as affecting the same problem, some tests are easy 
and some are hard, and when the scores are interpreted into 
semester marks this fact is often lost sight of. 
A number of principles affecting testing and grading have 
been worked out, as a result of experiences in standardizing 
tests, and these should be noted here: 
a. Any test should be so hard that there will be very few, if any, 
perfect scores. 
b. Any test should have elements in it so easy that every pupil in 
the group can make some score. There should be no zero 
scores. 
ce. A good test will have enough elements, sufficiently varying in 
difficulty, to get a fair distribution of the whole class. 
 
-P-A-G-E-315

2. The improved testing devices 
In this section will be given a description of a variety of 
devices that have been evolved in the standardized test 
movement, which, in general, are advised as substitutes for 
the old conventional discussions, or loose general questions. 
The various devices are first described separately, and their 
respective advantages and disadvantages are explained. 
Some incidental illustrations have already been given in the 
tests at the end of each chapter, but the descriptive section 
is followed by a set of illustrative tests that have actually 
been used extensively in the public schools in Los Angeles, 
by various teachers, in experimental codperation with the 
writer. These tests were based on specific textbooks, and 
the references are given in order to make it possible for the 
reader to compare the tests with the subject-matter covered 
by them. 
Enumeration tests. In these tests pupils are asked to 
“name” or “state” a very definite series of facts or topics. 
Questions of this type should usually call for broad outline 
or organization facts, or should compel such analysis of a 
large body of material. Pupils understanding that ques- 
tions are likely to be asked involving the relationship of 
various parts of an extended series of lessons, showing their 
grasp of the perspective, will begin to prepare for such ques- 
tions in tests and examinations, and one of the most helpful 
forms of study has then been motivated. This sort of anal- 
ysis is usually expected from advanced pupils, in high-school 
and university tests and examinations, and sometimes it is 
called for as a preliminary in extended discussions. If it is 
not specifically required, it is not only not given, but is sel- 
dom apparent in the discussion itself. 
In asking pupils to “enumerate” a series of facts it is 
usually advisable to give some reasonable leeway. If five
-P-A-G-E-316
  302 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
important phases of a movement in history have been dis- 
cussed, it will seem fairer to ask for three or four. Espe- 
cially if the enumeration calls for more subordinate elements 
or details, allowing such a margin will seem to avoid an 
unreasonable demand for memorization. 
Completion tests. One of the most effective of these test-_ 
ing devices is the completion test. This is also sometimes — 
called the “mutilated sentence,” or “mutilated page” test. 
The Starch American History Test was entirely composed of 
this type of exercise. Perhaps the best-known standardized 
test of this kind is the Trabue Language Completion Scale. 
As commonly used in the standardized tests, and as used in 
the present series, the work consists of reproducing the sub- 
stance or the exact wording of important sentences or para- 
graphs, with blank spaces for a number of the most impor- 
tant or key words of the thought. The tests are all so made 
as to require the filling in of only a single word for each 
blank. As far as possible, such words are selected for omis- 
sion as would require the pupil to give special attention to 
these words in studying the passage involved, if the tests 
themselves are used for study-guides. 
Good points of the completion test. The advantages and 
disadvantages of this type of test may be briefly enumer- 
ated. We will enumerate the advantages first. 
a. Very easy to make. The teacher will find the method of 
the completion test a very easy one to duplicate and modify. 
If such tests are used as study-guides, as is advised, the 
teacher may deem that more intensive study of certain para- 
graphs is desirable. To make a completion test that will 
compel the concentration of the pupils’ attention on im- 
portant words or facts, such as dates and names, will be easy 
and effective. The completion test model is also one that 
lends itself readily to the use of teachers of any content or 
information subject, notably history, geography, reading for
-P-A-G-E-317
  NEW METHODS IN TESTING 308 
comprehension, general science, or any of the textbook work 
in particular sciences. 
b. Searches for mastery of thought. Another advantage of 
this test is that it permits the pupil to master the thought or 
substance of an important passage without requiring verbal 
memorizing. In many cases teachers, in marking the papers, 
will be surprised at the ingenuity of the pupil either in fur- 
nishing acceptable synonyms or substitutes for the exact 
language of the textbook, or, when he does not know the 
proper sense of the passage, in trying to make something 
intelligible out of it. The verbal memorizing of the text is 
obviated by reproducing so much of the proper context of 
the key words that there are all sorts of helpful associations 
and a proper framework to fit the missing idea into. 
c. Rigid tests of real preparation. Another value of the 
completion tests is that they are rigid tests of real prepara- 
tion. In several years of experience, in testing university 
students with weekly or bi-weekly tests built up with the 
various devices used in the present series,.it has been found 
that this apparently simple mutilation of sentences is one of 
the most rigid that can be put to test their preparation. 
d. Easy to give. The completion test takes very little time 
to give. This is especially true if the tests can be prepared 
in mimeographed form. If they are written on the board, 
the blanks may be numbered and the pupils directed to write 
a list of words to correspond with the numbers. 
e. Good vocabulary training. In answering the completion 
tests the pupil gets a really valuable experience in vocabu- 
lary work. The teasing context forces him to call up every 
word at his command that will express the idea involved in 
the mutilated sentence. This value can be intensified if the 
teacher who uses the tests as study-guides will call the atten- 
tion of the pupils to the possibility and desirability of get- 
ting the idea so clearly in mind that they will have several 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  304 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
synonyms at their disposal, wherever they can think of such 
asubstitute. It should be especially helpful if students were 
instructed to be sure to look up definitions of such key words 
as they do not thoroughly understand. 
Disadvantages of the completion test. There are also a 
few disadvantages in connection with the completion tests 
that should be noted. 
a. Not very objective. The test is not as fully objective as 
might be desired, and is, therefore, not easy to score impar- 
tially. The teacher will often feel forced to fall back on her 
subjective judgment as to whether certain offered synonyms 
are acceptable or not. Some degree of arbitrariness must 
sometimes enter in. Fine, border-line shades between the 
acceptable will sometimes have to be drawn. The only cau- 
tion that must be observed here is that the marking must be 
perfectly consistent as between the different papers. A 
synonym must not be accepted as right in one paper, and be 
marked wrong in another. There are two ways of meeting 
this difficulty, which may confront the teacher in about ten 
per cent of the blanks. One way is to make out an arbitrary 
key at the beginning, and refuse to accept any alternative, 
no matter how plausible it may be. This will insure abso- 
lute impartiality as between different papers. Perhaps a 
better way is to keep an expanding key, adding for each 
blank the accepted synonyms as they are marked right. 
This will make the marking fairer without danger of par- 
tiality, and also less arbitrary. 
b. Requires care in construction. One must also be careful 
in making out a completion test to have only a few blanks 
in each sentence. It is possible to make the tests too difficult 
by leaving too bare a context. If one were to omit all words 
but articles, prepositions, and other unimportant elements, 
the sentence would give no intelligible clue for thought. For 
example, if we were to use the first sentence of this para-
-P-A-G-E-319
  
  NEW METHODS IN TESTING 305 
graph, it would evidently be ridiculous to offer the student 
the following sentence to complete: “One must also be 
eas eee an madking: OUbar ees 2 ts cs ei acca eiscin cae 
to have only a few ............ OF S808 i 
There is not enough context here to relate the sentence to 
education, or any other general field of thought. The omis- 
sion of the word “completion”? and the word “blanks” or 
“sentence” would be sufficient. 
AssIGNMENT: Criticize some of the completion tests you have 
had in this textbook, by applying the principles that have been 
given in this section. 
AsstcNMENT: Prepare several completion tests on chapters in 
some public-school textbook. 
“YES” and “NO” tests. The “Yes” and “No” tests 
as here described are a modification of the so-called “Right 
and Wrong,” or “True and False,” tests, commonly used in 
both the standardized group intelligence tests and various 
educational tests. Usually the test consists of a series of 
statements, true and false, or right and wrong, mixed in an 
irregular succession with about an equal number of true and 
false for any particular series. The pupil being tested is 
then required to write opposite each statement whether it is 
right or wrong, either by writing the word or the initial let- 
ters, or by underscoring “true” or “false,” which are both 
printed opposite each of the statements. 
In the present series the modification has been introduced 
because a number of teachers who have been experimenting 
with the tests of this type believe that it is an undesirable 
practice, from a psychological point of view, to put wrong or 
misleading statements before a child. This objection is 
therefore here avoided, without doing away with other 
desirable elements involved in this type of test. With older 
pupils, possibly in the high school, the original “true” or 
“false” form may be permissible. In that form it has proved
-P-A-G-E-320
306 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
a very desirable and effective test with university students 
in education classes. 
It is possible to take advantage of much of the contro- 
versial matter in educational textbooks as material for this 
type of test. One of the most effective tests is offered on 
topics that involve discussions of popular fallacies, or unde- 
sirable common practices in school work which are discussed 
in such texts. The statement of the fallacy is certain to trip 
up those who have not carefully prepared on the required 
assignments. 
Advantages of this type of test. These may be enumer- 
ated as: 
a. Absolute objectivity. One of the most striking advan- 
tages of the “YES” and “NO” test. In selecting state- 
ments for such a test the teacher must be careful to avoid 
debatable statements; if such are left out there is no possi- 
bility for difference of opinion in marking the tests. 
b. Easily given. A second advantage is the ease with 
which such a test may be given, and the very short time it 
takes to write such a test. In some subjects a very free use 
can be made of this device. 
c. Economical. The test is also economical, in that it may 
be used for group work in oral form. The statements or 
questions may be read, usually twice in succession, to a class, 
and the papers will then merely consist of a slip with num- 
bers corresponding to the questions, each with its “Yes” or 
“No,” or “R” or “W” answer. In this form the test con- 
stitutes one of the important elements in the Chapman Oral 
Intelligence Test. 
d, Easily marked. Such papers are also easily and quickly 
marked and scored. Where the teacher has any helpers this 
marking can be done by others, if a proper key is furnished 
them. 
e. Require little verbal memory. Some, who believe that
-P-A-G-E-321
NEW METHODS IN TESTING. 307 
less emphasis should be put on memory work in content sub- 
jects, will find an argument for these tests in the fact that 
very little verbal memory is involved. 
Objections to this type of test. One objection or difficulty 
in the use of the “Yes” and “No” tests must be noted. 
There is a possibility that the element of guessing may enter 
in. It might even be possible for a pupil to get a perfect 
score, without any preparation, by a lucky series of guesses. 
This objection, though, has been effectively met by the 
method in which these tests are usually scored. It is cus- 
tomary to score by subtracting the total value of the wrong 
answers from the total value of the right answers given. 
This is done on the theory that where there are only two 
alternative answers possible the “guesser” has a “50-50” 
chance, and that on this basis it is fair to assume that for 
every wrong guess there was also a right guess. The wrong 
guess is therefore doubly penalized. The justice of this 
method of marking is sustained by all educational statis- 
ticians, and the principle has been incorporated in the 
marking of a number of the most prominent tests on the 
market. 
If the test is given orally, it must also be noted as a disad- 
vantage that the pupil is not given a chance to look over his 
paper, after the test is completed. 
Association tests. This type of test may be used where 
there is a natural mental connection between any two facts. 
The test consists in giving one of the members, and expecting 
the other to be given. The type of connected-member or 
association may often be specified. The method is espe- 
cially adapted to content subjects with a rich factual element, 
as in history or geography. In history the “dates-events,” 
“men-movements,” and “cause-effect” are familiar pairs. 
Either may be given in the test, and its proper associate 
called for. In geography we would find such natural pairs  
-P-A-G-E-322
  308 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
99 66 as “country-capital,” “region-product,” “resource-indus- 
try,” and the like. 
There are a number of possible modifications of the Asso- 
ciation Tests that have been used extensively in the group 
intelligence tests, and in various devices used for objective 
testing in psychological laboratory experimentation. 
One of the common forms is known as the “opposites” 
test, which requires the giving of antonyms. Such elements 
could easily be used for certain types of content material, 
and would be especially useful in some of the drill work in 
vocabulary studies in English or reading, or in the form work 
in language. 
Another phase of the Association Test is the so-called 
Genus-Species Test. The cue-word may be either the gen- 
eric or specific term, and the related word is to be supplied. 
Tests of this sort would probably be convenient variations 
in some of the science work. 
It will be apparent that both these variations may com- 
bine a considerable element of reasoning, along with the 
memory-element involved. 
Asstenment: Explain why there is little opportunity for the use 
of the “association” device in this textbook. 
Asstenment: Make a short association test covering any of the 
material you have studied in this book. Let the various papers 
of students be compiled for a general association test for the 
class. 
Reasoning tests. The most difficult task that has been 
met by the makers of standardized tests is the making of 
devices that would give a large place to reasoning or judg- 
ment activities. The intention is to present material in an 
economical way that will involve some form of thinking, 
without the need of any recall of memorized learning. 
Such tests of the higher mental powers would be especially 
valuable in the rating of general intelligence. A few such
-P-A-G-E-323
NEW METHODS IN TESTING 309 
devices have been developed, but the field is still largely 
unexplored. In some of the group intelligence tests the 
scheme has been used of what might be called a common- 
sense selection of the right reason, from a list of several 
alternatives. In the Terman group test, for example, we 
have a test including items such as the following: 
Why do we buy clocks? Because 
1. We like to hear them strike. 
2. They have hands. 
8. They tell us the time. 
Spokes of a wheel are often made of hickory, because 
1. Hickory is tough. 
2. It cuts easily. 
3. It takes paint nicely. 
In attempting to work out reasoning tests of this sort, it 
will probably be helpful to try to work out problems along 
some of the more common categories of thinking, such as 
cause-effect, effect-cause, classification, general-particular, 
fact-principle. 
Illustrations of Testing Devices. Following are shown 
a number of tests, based on Thwaites and Kendall’s 4 His- 
tory of the United States (1924 revised edition). Tests for 
general review sections are shown, as well as tests for a 
single chapter. In each test a combination of testing de- 
vices was employed as the material permitted it. The words 
Completion, Enumeration, etc., over each section of the 
test are given here for identification of the various devices. 
Each of the tests was worked out on a basis of a total of 
fifty or one hundred points for the test. Each question or 
section and each item was then weighted with an arbitrary 
value by an estimate of its relative importance in the lesson. 
If the tests were standardized these values would probably 
have to be changed some to conform to the relative diffi- 
culty of the items, as shown by pupil performances.

_ NEW METHODS IN TESTING _ 317 
8. Objections to these testing devices 
They deprive students of free expression. One of the 
common objections made to these testing devices by univer- 
sity students is that they are deprived of the opportunity for 
free, organized, and individual expression on the topics in- 
volved. The tests are said to be too particular and cramp- 
ing in their demands for specific responses. It has been 
brought out in several connections that two of the most 
valuable skills pupils can learn are the ability to organize 
their thoughts by outlining, and to express them in a clear, 
ready form of composition. 
As far as the former of these abilities, the opportunity for 
practice in outlining, is concerned, the charge against these 
testing devices is entirely unwarranted. It has been shown 
in the description of the “enumeration” tests that ques- 
tions of this type are specially intended to test the student 
on his ability to grasp and retain, or to formulate such ele- 
ments of an organization or outline. By this device the 
pupil is required to give his outline without expanding it. 
If one has to choose between testing a pupil on his mere 
grasp of the analysis or organization of a body of material 
he has studied and his ability to produce a formless, dis- 
jointed, incoherent mass of sentences on the same topic, 
surely the former must be recognized as the more efficient 
and satisfactory test. And it is more satisfactory, not only 
from the point of view of thoroughness and completeness in 
testing the pupil’s evaluations of a large body of material, 
but it is also much more satisfactory from the point of view 
of the teacher’s evaluating the relative merits of the differ- 
ent papers. The “enumeration” device gives a group of 
test papers that are far more objective and tangible for 
grading, and much more economical. 
As far as the other phase of the expression objection is con-  
-P-A-G-E-332
    318 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
cerned, the charge must be admitted. It becomes a question 
that each teacher must settle for herself, — Is the testing 
period intended to test, or is it intended to give pupils prac- 
tice in composition, especially of the evasive, incoherent 
type we so often find? Are the conditions of the testing or 
examination period, with the limited amount of time that is 
available, suited to the proper exercise of written expression? 
If there is a call for composition in connection with the sub- 
ject in question, should not the students be given an oppor- 
tunity to do such work under more favorable circumstances 
than the stress and hurry of the examination period? 
Easy to be dishonest and copy. Another objection raised 
is that it is easy for pupils to be dishonest in such tests. It is 
easy to catch the single word inserted in a specific space on a 
neighbor’s paper in a completion test, or to copy his “yes” 
and “no” or “R” and “W” list in the Right and Wrong 
test, or to get one or more of his items in an enumeration 
test. 
If the seating arrangement is such in a room that such 
copying is made easy, the teacher may resort to one of sev- 
eral devices to frustrate this. If the test covers two pages of 
mimeographed material, as is often the case, pages one and 
two may be distributed alternately if a natural break is 
made at the bottom of page one. These may be completed, 
and the pages may then be distributed again with a reversed 
alternation, those who had page one being given page two. 
Or two nearly identical tests with questions arranged in dif- 
ferent order, may be made. In giving a “yes-and-no” or 
“right-and-wrong”’ test orally, the students in the class may 
be numbered consecutively and be instructed to write the 
proper answers only for the “odd” or “‘even” statements as 
they are read. The whole list may then be read twice, with 
the second reading following a different set of numbers, so 
that each question will be read “odd” one time and “even”
-P-A-G-E-333
NEW METHODS IN TESTING 319 
the next, and vice versa. Each pupil will then answer all of 
the statements, and the correction will involve the use of 
two keys, one for the “odd” numbered papers and one for 
the “even.” 
Time and cost of preparation. A third objection is the 
time and cost of preparing such tests. Considerable thought 
and ingenuity have to be expended in the original composi- 
tion of them — far more than is necessary to select a set of 
random topics or problems for a discussion paper. Then the 
tests are all more economical of class time if they can be 
mimeographed. If such facilities are not furnished in the 
school there are possible substitutes; the right-and-wrong 
test may be read to the class; completion and enumeration 
tests may be put on the board to be copied and answered, or 
the blanks may be numbered and the answers be written as 
a list to correspond with the numbers. 
The time expended on composing the tests is well in- 
vested. Such tests, when once gotten up for any textbook, 
can be used over and over with successive classes, if the com- 
pleted papers are retained by the teacher or destroyed. If 
the test is a thorough and reasonable one, there is hardly 
even an objection to the pupils seeing the tests. In fact, 
such tests are here advised as one of the most satisfactory 
types of study-guiding. 
Too great emphasis placed on memory. Another objec- 
tion raised against such tests by university students is the 
charge that these devices place too great an emphasis on 
memorization, especially of exact details. The charge is 
sometimes made in a contemptuous way, with the implica- 
tion that memorizing lessons was quite beneath the dignity 
of a university student. High-school students may be ex- 
pected to enter a similar protest. 
To some extent the charge must be admitted as an objec- 
tion; the best thing to offset it is to work out as generous an 
   
-P-A-G-E-334
  820 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
amount of “reasoning” tests as can be devised, although it 
must be admitted that it is easier to give this advice than to 
follow it. The reasoning test is the most difficult to work 
out. On the other hand, we must not allow the complaint 
to stand at its full value. There is not enough serious intent 
to learn for permanent retention, and perhaps such tests 
may have a wholesome effect in curing students of too great 
a tendency to superficial and temporary learning. 
Assignment: Work out a reasoning test for one of the chapters 
you have studied in this book. 
Involve too tense a nerve strain. A final objection that 
must be noted is the fact that students are put to some nerv- 
ous strain, especially if a time limit is set on the tests. If 
the teacher does not wish to do this, the objection, of course, 
does not hold. This time-limit is an advisable condition, 
however. Usually the time should be sufficient for only a 
few to finish, if there is a desire to rank the students on the 
results. This will observe the principles advised for all good 
testing, to insure a satisfactory spread of the group over the 
total range. Students will become accustomed to the 
methods and to the idea of a time limitation, and they will 
come to recognize the superior fairness of having all treated 
exactly alike in the matter of time. Only a small percentage 
of gain is to be derived by letting all have as much time as 
they need to finish, and the whole value of economy is lost. 
Moreover, the chance for copying is increased, unless papers 
are turned in as soon as they are finished, and this will con- 
tribute an unnecessary confusion. 
4. Summary of advantages of such tests 
General advantages. The advantages of the various 
testing devices have been considered in connection with each 
type. The general advantages may be summarized briefly.
-P-A-G-E-335
NEW METHODS IN TESTING 321 
a. They are all much more objective than the discussion 
examinations, and therefore they can be scored much more 
impartially, and the scores permit much more exact grading 
of a class. 
b. They are much more effective. More ground can be 
covered by a twenty-minute test than by a week of “recita- 
tion-testing,” or than an hour of written-discussion testing. 
As compared with the recitation, every pupil is made re- 
sponsible for every element in the ground covered. As com- 
pared with the discussion, the tests are really severe in their 
accurate searching of a student’s work; there is a pointed- 
ness to the responses called for that makes it impossible to 
evade. Mature students, who are perfectly frank, admit 
this is their most serious objection to them. 
c. All forms of the tests are more economical, not only in 
the time taken to give them, but especially in the time taken 
to mark and grade them. They relieve the teacher of one of 
the most unsatisfactory pieces of drudgery she has to deal 
with. 
There are four further advantages that have not been 
taken up in connection with any of the specific types that 
should be discussed more fully at this point. 
Diagnostic value. Such tests can be made very valuable 
for accurate diagnosis, because they can be made so specific 
and because they can test the pupils in such a variety of 
ways. All that can be said for standardized tests as a means 
of pupil diagnosis can be claimed for these imitation tests. 
The technique of diagnosis based on such tests cannot be 
developed fully here.!_ Such pupil weaknesses as inability to 
organize, failure to select and study carefully important

paragraphs and an unwillingness to exert himself to the 
limit of his ability, are a few of the general results aa will 
stand out as soon as a few of such test scores are combined. 
One of the most startling revelations as to the presence of 
two distinct types of attitude in university classes of large 
size, where personal acquaintance is quite out of the ques- 
tion, was made by the persistent recurrence of a bi-modal 
curve for every test, with the lower mode near the passing or 
“credit point” dividing line. Individual follow-up inter- 
views were productive in admissions that justified all the 
time that had been spent on the making of the tests and the 
scoring of results. 
Make grading of subject-matter possible. A further value 
is found in the fact that the tests make it possible to grade 
the relative difficulties of subject-matter in terms of pupil 
performances. In the sample tests given on pages 310 to 
316, each part of each test has been arbitrarily evaluated 
and weighted. The teacher using such tests for several 
semesters would not only have an accurate basis of true 
weighting, but would obtain an illuminating insight into 
difficulties and needs for supplementary emphasis and ex- 
planation. 
Make experimentation possible. Another advantage and 
use of such objective testing devices is in experimentation. 
To some extent standardized tests are available for this 
purpose, and where they are available they are probably 
preferable. A large number of teaching experiments, espe- 
cially in the comparison of various methods, have been car- 
ried on under the writer’s supervision by teachers in the ele- 
mentary and high schools of Los Angeles and vicinity, in 
which it was often found necessary to make a distinctive set 
of objective “end” tests, as well as considerable material 
of the same sort for practice. In all such work these testing 
devices were found most valuable; in fact, many of the ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
  
NEW METHODS IN TESTING 323 
periments could not have been undertaken without them. 
Useful as study-guides. A final use of the tests is for 
study-guides, in either supervised study or individual in- 
straction schemes. The samples given for the Thwaites 
and Kendall History of the United States, on pages 310 
to 316 were used in modified form to fit another textbook 
in the opportunity rooms for exceptional children in Los 
Angeles. 
In order to carry out the study-guide scheme in super- 
vised or directed study it is desirable that the teacher should 
have two copies of the test for each pupil in the class. One 
set is distributed to the pupils at the beginning of the work in 
each chapter. This serves as a study-guide, or assignment, 
for the week’s work. It is a frank contract with the pupil 
that these questions cover the important elements to be spe- 
cially studied and learned. The second copy, an exact du- 
plicate, is used for the final test on the work of the chapter. 
This may be given as soon as the work on the chapter is com- 
pleted, or it may be deferred a week, thus motivating a fur- 
ther review of the previous week’s work just before the test 
is given.

Phases of the teacher’s planning. There are three phases of 
the teacher’s work in which careful, systematic forethought 
will help to meet important problems. These are: 
(1) The organization of the subject-matter she is dealing with; 
(2) The methods to be used in connection with the subject- 
matter; and 
(3) Certain phases of classroom management that are connected 
with the conduct of the recitation or class period. 
The last of these lies outside the province of this book. 
The first two are commonly thought of together, and as 
such are usually referred to as “lesson-planning.” As will 
soon appear in the development of the chapter, though, this 
customary term is somewhat misleading, and its use has 
probably been one of the reasons for a neglect of one of the 
most important phases of planning a teacher should do, 
For this reason a more inclusive term was taken for the title 
of this chapter. This neglected phase of instruction plan-
-P-A-G-E-342
  828 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
ning has to do with the larger units of work — the task of 
the semester, or of a month or week — and both organiza- 
tion of subject-matter and the selection of methods are in- 
volved in this large-unit phase of planning, as well as in the 
more specific and detailed “lesson-plan” for the ultimate, 
daily units of work. | 
This introductory section suggests that there will be two 
main divisions to the discussion of instruction planning: 
1. Planning the Organization of Subject-Matter, or the analysis, 
arrangement, and evaluation of what is to be taught. 
2. Planning Teaching Methods, or the careful determination of 
how the subject-matter is to be presented, or how the teacher 
and pupils are to proceed in their work. + 
We shall now proceed to consider each of these, i | order, 
1. The organization of subject-matter 
fiche plan- Planning the units of material. The teacher’s 
ning must deal with the distribution of the large units of 
work. As arule teachers who have had several years of ex- 
perience begin to discontinue making daily-lesson plans. 
This detailed preparation for the day’s work becomes less 
necessary, especially where material is being re-taught; the 
teacher gains confidence in her ability to plan most of her 
work mentally instead of continuing the formal, laborious 
planning that was necessary in training school days; and 
the stress of work often makes this careful, systematic 
preparation impossible. 
The teacher, though, never reaches a stage where she can 
well afford to neglect the large-unit phase of instruction 
planning. Her work is usually set before her in large 
semester-units in the course of study. Only a few superin- 
tendents or principals provide a course of study in which a 
teacher is required to cover a specified part of a semester’s 
work in a week or a month. In a system of any size the
-P-A-G-E-343
  PLANNING INSTRUCTION 329 
need for an elastic program, to be determined by the teach- 
er’s judgment, is felt to be more advisable, or absolutely 
necessary. Under such circumstances the teacher must re- 
- cognize the responsibility, and prepare early in the semester 
at least a tentative program that shall properly break up the 
semester’s work into reasonable units for the different weeks. 
Working out the daily units. If it seems at all feasible, 
such large-unit programs should at once proceed to « plan- 
ning of daily units, at least for the first few weeks, and such 
daily-unit planning must be continued well in advance of 
the progress made by the class. The daily unit may have 
been consciously kept in mind in the planning of the weekly 
units. This can be done roughly by establishing a reason- 
able “pages-per-day” unit for distributing the semester’s 
work. Such a unit may easily be established by a mere 
mechanical computation, dividing the semester’s total num- 
ber of pages by the total number of days, but in making 
such a rough approximation there are several modifying con- 
ditions that must be kept in mind. 
Observe natural divisions in subject-matter. We have 
already noted that textbooks, the usual core of the semes- 
ter’s work, are already highly organized, with chapter, 
section, and topical divisions. These natural divisions must 
be taken into consideration when the daily unit organiza- 
tion for instruction is being planned. Sometimes textbooks 
are made with such natural lesson divisions that the matter 
of unit planning is practically unnecessary. More com- 
monly, though, some thought must be given to the relation 
of these two factors to one another. One day’s assignment 
may have to be stretched a bit beyond the unit, the next 
may have to fall short of it. The less consideration the text- 
book maker has given to the teaching unit, the more atten- 
tion will the teacher have to give to her semester plans. 
Make allowance for losses. In planning the “pages-per-
-P-A-G-E-344
  » 830 PROGRESSIVE. METHODS OF TEACHING 
day” unit careful foresight must be exercised in making al- 
lowances for loss of time due to apie, reviews, and 
tests, with a reasonable margin for interruptions and repeti- 
tions that cannot readily be foreseen. The total of such 
allowances may well be averaged at two or three weeks for 
the semester. 
It is in this connection that the bhkpaee and importance fo 
this rather mechanical planning must be apparent. The 
teacher who fails to make some plan of this sort is sure to 
come to the end of the semester with part of the work un- 
done. She will either have to send her pupils on to the next 
grade poorly prepared, or will have to impose an extra bur- 
den on the next teacher. If the lagging behind schedule is 
discovered a few weeks before the close of the semester, the 
pupils may be subjected to the burden of an unfair propor- 
tion of the term’s work. The semester ends in an unneces- 
sary tangle of worry for the teacher. If the lack of foresight 
cannot be overcome, and if the pupils are passed on without 
the next teacher’s being informed of their shortcomings, the 
new semester will open with an injustice for both teacher 
and pupils. Usually the teacher lagging in her program will | 
be loath to reveal her failure. Such professional unfairness 
cannot be too strongly condemned. 
AsstGNMENT: Make out a semester plan. Select a particular sub- 
ject for a particular grade. Assume a textbook basis. Get 
some city or state course of study, and use the semester’s total 
there given for your exercise. Select some unit for which a 
semester’s assignment in a particular textbook is given. Com- 
pute and state your “daily unit.” Indicate what sections you 
would expect to cover each week. Show why you modify 
your “pages-per-day” unit in some instances according to the 
principles stated in the foregoing discussion. Indicate, in 
connection with the first two weeks of work, your daily units. 
Also indicate probable supplementary material you would 
expect to use for the first two weeks.
-P-A-G-E-345
PLANNING INSTRUCTION 331 
Organization of subject-matter. In most cases where the 
textbook is used as the principal source of subject-matter for 
the semester’s work, little need be done in an original way in 
the organization of subject-matter. More may have to be 
done in the way of reorganization, which will be discussed in 
the next section. 
In the semester plan the general organization has been 
provided for, in the principle of having regard for the natural 
main divisions in breaking up the material into lesson units. 
In the daily-lesson plan there is a distinct place, however, 
for the teacher’s own outline of the material to be taught. 
Such analysis or outlining of the content of the lesson will 
be carried out in the plan in various degrees of detail, de- 
pending partly on the teacher’s own mastery of the subject, 
partly on the complexity of the material, and partly on the 
stage of advancement of the pupils. 
Reorganization of textbook material. The thoughtful 
teacher will usually give the question of reorganization of 
subject-matter considerable attention, and the outline of 
such a reorganized lesson will appear in the lesson-plan. It 
will have an important influence on both assignment and 
the class-period activities. Various reasons for such reor- 
ganization may be indicated. 
a. To meet the values of the material. The teacher must 
exercise her judgment in evaluating the material, just as the 
author of the textbook has done. The first consideration, in 
this connection, is that of logical arrangement. The teacher 
has a right to review the material by this criterion, and from 
her own point of view. She need not agree with the author. 
She may rearrange to insure a different emphasis. She may 
eliminate, substitute, supplement, or bring separated sec- 
tions together for purposes of comparison or contrast. 
b. To meet the purposes of instruction. The teacher may 
decide on a pedagogical arrangement that will be more  
-P-A-G-E-346
  | 
382 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
effective, even if the logical acest is thereby disre- 
garded. This may be done for large or small units, for a 
whole week’s work, or for topics within a single lesson. The 
fact that logical arrangement is not always best suited for 
teaching purposes is illustrated in a striking way by the 
newer types of arithmetics and language textbooks, that 
feature the setting aside of logical arrangement for pedagog- 
ical or psychological reasons.! 
c. To meet the needs, interests, and capacities of pupils, 
either as individuals or as distinctive groups. The most sig- 
nificant variations in the needs of pupils are social, and the 
variations are due to such factors as time and place, and 
economic circumstances or prospects. The interests of 
pupils are not to be localized, nor are they necessarily dom- 
inated by any of the other factors in social needs. Interests 
vary largely according to the child’s previous experiences in 
school, as well as out of school. In so far as interests are a 
controlling factor in selection of subject-matter the adjust- 
ment is largely one to be made by the individual teacher, not 
by the general curriculum-maker, as has been shown in 
another connection (see pages 60-61. A third pupil factor is 
the matter of variation in ability or capacity. Rapid read- 
justment is going on in the more progressive public school 
systems, to meet the variations in ability, usually for groups 
of slow, average, or bright pupils, but at present large ad- 
justments of this sort still remain for the teacher to make. 
AssiGNMENT: Select a chapter in some school textbook, and show 
how you would plan to reorganize the material to meet the 
needs, interests, and capacities of a particular group or class of 
pupils. For example, how would you plan modifications if 
  
1 One of the best illustrations may be found in the Thorndike series of 
arithmetics, with an explanation and defense of such radical rearrange- 
ment in Thorndike’s Psychology of Arithmetic and his New Methods in 
Arithmetic.
-P-A-G-E-347
  PLANNING INSTRUCTION 333 
you had a very bright class? a very dull class? a class in an 
aristocratic neighborhood? a tenement district? a farming 
community? Or select any other definite modifying condition 
you wish. 
d. To meet the ability, tastes, and interests of the teacher. 
Adjustments here must be made thoughtfully and con- 
scientiously. This principle may only be given secondary 
consideration; the subject-matter, the method of instruction, 
and, above all, the children’s needs may never be sacrificed. 
An illustration may serve to make this clear. If the choice 
of several poems is offered in the course of study for mem- 
orization, it may be presumed that there is no need for 
evaluation by the teacher on the ground of subject-matter; 
and there may be no choice from the point of view of in- 
struction. If the teacher can find no preference on the 
basis of probable interest in the children of her group, there 
is no reason why she should not consult her own taste in the 
matter. Similarly with books for supplementary reading, 
or with possible alternative topics in any lesson. 
In making such decisions there must never be an evasion 
of instructional responsibility on the grounds of difficulty 
for the teacher. On this ground we must justify the inclu- 
sion of teacher “ability”’ in the topic at the head of the sec- 
tion. If there is a choice between two reading selections, 
one a valuable bit of explanation that will lend itself to in- 
tense, quiet supervised study, the other a dramatic selection 
requiring considerable skill in class management because of 
possible confusion that might be hard for the teacher to 
reduce, there is no objection to taking that selection which 
the teacher’s abilities will fit her to carry through more suc- 
cessfully and with more profit to the class. 
Such alternatives may even dominate the major portion 
of the teacher’s method of instruction. Types of person- 
ality are important factors in determining the effectiveness
-P-A-G-E-348
BE ge Pe ee GE Re eS ee a e, eR ape Eee ape) a ee 
334 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
of various methods. Each teacher, by experience in the 
classroom, will sooner or later become conscious of special 
abilities and limitations. One could never successfully man- 
age a class discussion or socialized recitation; another may 
be conscious of special success with the telling or lecture 
method. Yet neither of these teachers might do well with 
supervised study, in which a third type might succeed pre- 
eminently, though meeting with only average results in the 
other types of work. Often the method will determine in- 
clusions and eliminations of subject-matter, just as the ma- 
terial may at times dictate a particular type of method as 
the most natural one to use. 
Principles of organization. The matter of organization 
and reorganization may be analyzed from a different pcint 
of view, technical rather than practical, rhetorical rather 
than pedagogical. Such an analysis will give us three im- 
portant principles that should be observed in outlining 
subject-matter. 
a. The principle of unity. Lesson units should be units, 
not merely from the point of view of logical subdivision, but 
also when considered on the side of aim. In making the 
lesson-plan for the day, the single purpose, from the stand- 
point of instruction, must be clear and definite. In discuss- 
ing the statement of aim in connection with the inductive 
development method (pages 73-74), it was pointed out that 
one of the recent modifications of the original Herbartian 
scheme made provision for both a “general aim” and a “spe- 
cific aim.” This was merely intended as a device to prevent 
scattering, a fault that would be especially fatal in lessons 
of the inductive type. The danger of such lack of unity in 
purpose, though, is not absent in connection with other 
methods, and is sometimes greater in dealing with small 
units of subject-matter than in dealing with larger units. 
In sthe latter case a better perspective and the need for  
-P-A-G-E-349
PLANNING INSTRUCTION 335 
steady progression compel a more careful attention to organ- 
ization on the principle of unity. 
b. The principle of codrdination. This principle applies 
especially to the selection and arrangements of the main 
topics in the outline of subject-matter. The questions of 
coherence and sequence both enter in. Usually the “main 
topics” of the teacher’s lesson plan will be the only ones in 
the outline that will be apparent to the pupil as the lesson 
proceeds. The need of careful selection, balance, and pro- 
portion will therefore be plain. 
c. The principle of subordination. In outlining technique, 
while unity and coherence for the work as a whole are con- 
trolled by the selection, proportion, and sequence of the 
_ main divisions, the unity of each division is controlled by 
two elements, the proper subordination of the subdivisions 
to their main division and the codrdination of these sub- 
divisions to one another. In any scheme of outlining a more 
or less arbitrary set of symbols is used to indicate codrdina- 
tion, while the fact of subordination is shown both by a 
change from one series of symbols to another, and by the 
equal indentation of each successive subordinate series. This 
may be illustrated by one of the systems of symbols com- 
monly used for outline analysis: 
I 
te 
ve (1) Ser  
-P-A-G-E-350
336 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Il. 
a. 
b. 
2. 
Topics that would be indicated by the Roman numerals 
are codrdinate to one another, and subordinate only to the 
general subject. Those indicated by Arabic figures under 
any one of the Roman numerals are all subordinate to it, and 
codrdinate to one another. The subordination is shown by 
the use of a different series of symbols and by indentation. 
Similar is the subordination of topics under I, 2, and under 
III, 1, shown by letters of the alphabet. The series of 
symbols available for showing different degrees of subordi- 
nation is practically unlimited, and the most intricate sub- 
ordinate relationships may thus be expressed in a formal 
outline or brief. The selection of various conventional 
systems is largely an arbitrary matter, though there is a 
somewhat standard uniformity as to the order in which the 
different series are to be used, which is that given above. 
The symbolism is not so important, however, as the fact 
of proper codrdination and subordination, for the main 
divisions and for all subdivisions alike. Careful attention te 
these relationships in the thought is absolutely necessary to 
secure clearness, completeness, unity, sequence, coherence, 
‘and proportion. This method of outlining was originally 
invented as an aid in composition, then as an aid in the 
analysis of printed material, and in this connection the 
same principles are urged for effectiveness in teaching. 
The observance of these rhetorical principles is as important 
to secure clearness, completeness, proportion, and all the 
other qualities named above in instruction in the class 
period as it is in written expression. That teaching may 
have such qualities it is necessary to introduce the outline

of subject-matter into the lesson-plan — in some detail for 
the practice teacher and the novice; in more meagre detail 
for the experienced teacher.

principles discussed above. This is one of the early forms of 
the outline of this part of the present chapter. Can you ac-

Dangers to avoid in organizing subject-matter. The 
teacher in planning a lesson and in selecting, arranging, or- 
ganizing, and reorganizing subject-matter must be careful to 
avoid certain dangers. 
a. “The fetich of completeness.” It has already been 
pointed out that in textbook making one of the difficulties a 
specialist in subject-matter easily falls into is the reverence 
for “completeness” — the touching on every detail of a 
logical outline of his subject. This results in introducing
-P-A-G-E-352
  338 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
materials to be learned which have no justification on the 
basis of practical values; it confuses the essentials in a mass 
of detail; and it compels the study of topics at a time when a 
pupil is not prepared to deal with them. In many subjects 
the teacher will have to deal with the textbook material 
fearlessly. Revision on a scientific basis in the interests of 
teachableness has made considerable progress in a few sub- 
jects. Revision in other subjects, or in cases where the more 
progressive books are not in use, still lies in the hands of the 
teacher. 
Another factor that indicates the responsibility of the 
teacher here is the fact that many textbooks give an over- 
abundance of certain types of material, problems, and exer- 
cises, with the expectation that the teacher will make her 
own selection of material from the variety offered. 
b. Easy uniformity, or repetition. A second mistake a 
teacher should avoid in the selection and organization of 
subject-matter is easy uniformity, or repetition. It is desir- 
able to plan constant experiments in dealing with materials, 
either in connection with successive topics or in going over a 
semester’s work a second time. This is necessary not only 
for the sake of maintaining pupil-interest by variety, but 
also for developing mastery of the subject-matter on the 
part of the teacher. We may recall the sections in the older 
American histories in the constitutional period when the 
author fell into an easy uniformity of procedure in dealing 
with each successive administration. The Civil War was 
welcomed as a relief from this monotonous uniformity. 
Similar mechanical monotonies of organization are being 
discarded in the newer geographies, in dealing with the 
various countries, and in some of the high-school geome- 
tries. 
In some courses of study this selection and arrangement 
of subject-matter has continued in a uniform repetition for
-P-A-G-E-353
PLANNING INSTRUCTION 339 
so long as to have become a tradition. In the Latin course 
in the high school, not only in its entirety, but even within 
the sections of each year or semester’s work, in the Cesar, 
Cicero, and Virgil classes, the selection of “books” displays 
a slavish uniformity and a considerable lack of imagination 
or invention on the part of teachers. This deadening monot- 
ony is much further intensified by a traditional method of 
teaching. For this reason such a subject has long held a 
specious reputation for developing docile, conscientious, 
capable students; when the fact probably is that none but 
those born that way could survive. 
This traditional selection and arrangement of material, as 
well as this easy uniformity and monotonous repetition in 
method, spread to the teaching of the English language and 
literature, and to the modern languages, making them to a 
regrettable degree futile, until the very recent movements 
for revision in both subject-matter and methods. 
c. Too great reverence for the printed teat. A third danger in 
the selection of subject-matter is too great reverence for the 
printed text. This mental subservience to print has been 
discussed at some length in the chapters on the textbook, and 
on collateral reading (See especially pages 9-10 and 48-51.) 
It is merely mentioned in this connection because it is in the 
lesson planning that the teacher can do most to combat this 
tendency in herself, and insure its correction in the minds of 
pupils. If for no other reason than the shaking of the pupils’ 
unthinking acceptance of the printed page, the teacher 
should definitely plan to “skip” worthless sections, and to 
reorganize with a view of bringing in contradictory “print,” 
because of the opportunities to give training to this chal- 
lenging critical spirit. Perhaps the inexperienced teacher 
should take this opportunity to give herself some training in 
the same line.

  340 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
2. Planning teaching methods 
General form of daily lesson plans. We must now take up 
the specific form that will be desirable for the daily lesson- 
plan. The form is important at this point, because it is 
necessary to see how teaching procedure is to be related to 
subject-matter. 
Except for the teacher who has a fixed uniformity of 
method and who dares rely on the inspiration of the moment 
for devices, illustration, and questioning, an outline of 
method is as important as an outline of subject-matter. 
To bring these two outlines together in the most conven- 
ient way, teacher-training schools have, in the last few 
years, used a double-column scheme for lesson-planning, in 
which the organization of subject-matter is usually made in 
the left-hand column, and the parallel analysis or sugges- 
tions as to method of procedure and devices are stated in the 
right-hand column. 
One further feature of this double-column outline should 
be noted. The material is usually divided horizontally in a 
series of successive “steps.” This is largely an influence 
carried over into present practice from the “formal steps” of 
the inductive-development method. That method largely 
introduced the idea of having a lesson-plan, and developed 
the scheme to a highly formalized stage. It is impossible to 
get away from the influence of this Herbartian plan alto- 
gether, nor is it desirable, because some of the phases of les- 
son-planning under this method have values for almost any 
type of lesson. The general attitude of the teacher in mak- 
ing daily lesson-plans, as far as the question of form is con- 
cerned, may be summarized by saying the plan should be 
systematic, but it should also be elastic.

2. Be sure your “assignment” complies with

signment of mere limits of work is hardly satisfactory; pupils should be told how as 
well as what, and this should appear in 
Jesson-plans in this column. 
Steps I and I have to be worked out for an advance lesson before step V, the assignment, can properly be made. Often there will be considerable identity between step II and step V.
-P-A-G-E-356
342 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
eral methods that have been discussed, we therefore meet 
with two difficulties. The outline for the successive steps 
in the plan will be either too general to be suggestive, or too 
rigid to be adaptable to the various methods. The result is 
that the model may be recommended only with the injunc- 
tion that the teacher should use it as a suggestive scheme 
which may be modified with considerable freedom as her 
judgment may dictate. It may not always be necessary to 
work out both columns, nor is it necessary always to include 
all the steps. 
The form for the model plan may now be introduced (see 
page 341) and this may be followed by a series of further 
suggestions relative to its use. 
Use of textbook nucleus for subject-matter. It has been 
shown (Chapter I) that the textbook is an almost universal 
core for the subject-matter of instruction in American 
schools. This must be recognized frankly in lesson-planning, 
and the teacher should probably begin with a textbook dis- 
cussion as a nucleus for the subject-matter column of the 
lesson-plan, even if, in rare cases, the textbook is not actu- 
ally used. The suggestion is based on the fact that the 
textbook offers the most compact, complete, and convenient 
material for the general outline, even though it may have to 
be modified considerably. Where the textbook is used, it is 
advisable in most cases to keep fairly close to the pupils’ 
probable experience with the subject-matter in question. 
Even a university instructor who does not contemplate 
the use of a textbook in a course, but contemplates instruc- 
tion by the lecture method and supplementary reading, usu- 
ally finds it convenient to use, as a starting-point for his 
organization of the course, some textbook outline or a colla- 
tion of the outlines of several such books. This basis may be 
considerably altered, but it is a convenient and economical 
nucleus as a point of departure. For convenience in refer-
-P-A-G-E-357
  PLANNING INSTRUCTION 343 
ence the same thing is even more true in dealing with elemen- 
tary and high-school students, and this is as true for daily 
lesson-plans as it is for semester planning. 
Variety of possible methods of instruction. The whole 
purpose of this book has been to show teachers, and those 
preparing for the profession, that there is a variety of possi- 
ble general methods in teaching. The point of view was 
taken in the opening chapter that conducting recitations on 
the textbook material for the purpose of testing the pupils’ 
study was not only a natural method to begin with, but that 
it was for most necessary if not unavoidable. But it was 
also shown that this method was very wasteful, and should 
be modified as soon as possible by the selection of other 
methods that were shown to be more economical and effec- 
tive. 
It has also been implied in several connections, similarly, 
that some of these methods are better adapted to certain 
kinds of subject-matter, some more effective for various 
| purposes, some more suited to different types of teachers, or 
to the varying abilities or interests of pupils. The decision 
as to selection of method must be made by the teacher at the 
time of her lesson-planning, and that decision will largely 
determine the type of suggestions put into the second col- 
umn of the lesson-plan. The selection of method will be 
made on the basis of considerations named in the sentence 
preceding the last. One value of the formal double-column 
plan lies in the fact that it offers a direct challenge to make 
such a selection of method, to make it intelligently, and, 
when it has once been made, to give considerable thought to 
the detailed application of the method to the particular 
subject-matter in hand for the day. 
Gradual improvement in method. The question of a 
teacher’s improvement in her work will probably hinge 
largely on her use or neglect of lesson-planning. This does 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
  344 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
not imply that a teacher who does not make lesson-plans 
every day will not be progressive; neither is the reverse true. 
It is in connection with lesson-planning, whether this be 
daily, occasional, or spasmodic, that the most natural stim- 
ulus will come for professional improvement, both in extend- 
ing one’s mastery over subject-matter and in giving atten- 
tion to improvement in technique. 
An impossible ideal program could easily be mapped out 
for the’ teacher who has determined to stop wasting her 
pupils’ time in textbook recitation-testing. Such a program 
might easily be made so ambitious as to be a counsel of per- 
fection. If in her lesson-planning, in addition to a program 
of reading for improvement in her grasp of the subjects she 
is teaching, a beginning teacher should propose to try out 
one or two new methods each semester, for occasional class 
periods, or for a few weeks at a time, she would probably be 
undertaking enough. Almost every one of the general 
methods discussed in this book, which is intended as only an 
introductory survey of them all, has an extensive literature 
devoted to it. To keep up with the books and periodical 
literature dealing with a single one of the newer methods 
would be an impossibility for any teacher. To initiate a 
trial of some new method will involve the reading of consid- 
erable selections from such lists. A modest, gradual modifi- 
cation of methods is all that is advised. 
Progress lies only in constant experimentation with 
methods. Teachers who have made some advance in tech- 
nique, away from the primitive recitation of their inexperi- 
enced days, may have found a professional haven of content. 
At some progressive stage a new method was discovered, 
tried, and found particularly suited to the teacher’s tastes 
and personality. The method perhaps first attracted atten- 
tion because of such reasons, and its success argues for its 
permanent and universal use. Such a teacher may be more
-P-A-G-E-359
Ca ee PLANNING INSTRUCTION 845 
successful than another who uses a more wasteful method, 
but she is no longer a progressive teacher. Progress lies 
only in constant experimentation with methods. This does 
not involve that all new “fads” must be tried, nor does it 
mean that the new must necessarily supplant the old. The | 
fact that a method is new does not necessarily prove its 
superiority, its adaptability to all subject-matter, or to every | 
type of teacher and every type of pupil. | 
An experimental knowledge of the values of a variety of 
methods, though, and an open-minded willingness to test 
out any new suggestion with a fair trial, mark the truly 
progressive teacher. Convictions about various methods, 
especially new ones, are desirable if they are based on careful 
experimentation with them. Prejudices are never justified, 
whether they are positive or negative. Knowledge about 
all methods is a worthy goal for every teacher; contented ig- 
norance of any is a sure sign of arrested professional growth. 
The true experimentation attitude. While the experimen- 
tation with methods must be in the spirit of true experimen- 
tation, based on an adequate understanding of the distinc- 
tive technique involved in the new method, with prejudices 
carefully laid aside, with conditions as rigidly controlled as 
work in the classroom will permit, and with objective tests 
to measure initial and final abilities of pupils,! the teacher 
should not lose sight of the fact that such experimentation is 
largely carried on for her own guidance. The personal equa- 
tion in determining teaching method cannot easily be con- 
trolled, nor should it be disregarded. The purpose of such 
experimentation may be frankly individual, though it may 
sometimes, if conducted on a high plane of scientific ac- 
curacy, give results worth publishing. Because of the im- 
portance of the personal element, every progressive teacher 
1 These essential features of experimentation have been developed more 
fully in other connections; see especially page 107f. and 207. 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
  346 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
will want to know for herself what results she can get with 
various methods. 
The occasion for determining and selecting such methods 
for experimentation will largely become a conscious process 
in connection with the planning of instruction, whether this 
be in the blocking out of large units in the semester program 
or in connection with the daily lesson-plan. 
Avoid burdensome detail in daily plans. To prevent the 
condemnation and neglect of lesson-planning as a hopeless 
burden, the teacher must proceed, as rapidly as her experi- 
ence warrants, with an intention of simplification of plans. 
Drudgery for the sake of formalism will not encourage sensi- 
ble, thoughtful planning. As a method is mastered by ex- 
perience, the second column of the lesson-plan will become 
briefer. As a mastery of subject-matter is extended by 
several repetitions, and by a considerable cumulation of sup- 
plementary material, the first column of the plan will become 
less specific. The planning is to be thought of as a necessary 
crutch. As a consciousness of mastery through experience 
and experimentation increases, the progress in planning will 
become more of a mental process, and the detailed writing of 
plans may then be discontinued.

AssIGNMENT: At this point students should be given a number of 
definite assignments of subject-matter for which to prepare 
lesson-plans. Perhaps five or six different types of material in 
different school subjects should be assigned to each student. 
Emphasis should be laid on the formal use of the model for 
such exercises. The student should be able to defend, on the 
basis of lesson-planning principles here given, the inclusion or 
omission of steps and topics in each plan. If time permits, 
several of the plans should be critically discussed in class, and 
individual conferences should be held with such students as 
show they have not mastered the principles.

CHAPTER XIII 
THE TREND TOWARD INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTION 
IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Present-day trends — Individual differences a teaching problem — Read- 
justments in organization — The discovery of retardation — Adminis- 
trative devices to reduce retardation — Supervised study as an individ- 
ualizing movement — The scientific classification of individual differ- 
ences — Special classes and rooms for extreme types — Individual 
attention for normal children — Vocational guidance — Individual 
trends in the project method of instruction — Actual individual- 
instruction experiments — Much of this trend incidental. 
Parallel readings — Review problems on the book. 
Present-day trends. Most of us have a social philosophy 
that associates mass education with public education, and 
individual instruction with private instruction. Such an 
association is not a necessary one, and there is a danger that 
it may stand in the way, as a prejudice, against a general 
movement in American education that is becoming more cer- 
tain and more widespread every year. Our public school 
system is fast headed toward individual instruction, and 
that in spite of increased costs and of the staggering difficul- 
ties it involves in school administration, classroom manage- 
ment, and teaching methods. 
Most of the movements now prominent in the best schools 
and school systems that suggest we are headed, far more 
rapidly than most of us realize, toward individual instruc- 
tion or something closely approaching it, do not at all have 
this as their aim; but they are contributing to the trend be- 
cause of the incidental emphasis on the individual that is 
involved in them. 
It is only within the last few decades that these more or 
less independent movements in educational practice and in
-P-A-G-E-366
352 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
educational research have given us a most convincing mass 
of evidence that the work of the classroom teacher will have 
to be modified radically, in the direction of individual atten- 
tion, in order to meet the needs of most pupils. School sys- 
tems are still administered on the principle that equal edu- 
cational opportunity must necessarily involve mass teaching. 
Individual differences as a teaching problem. The whole 
elementary-school population in almost any community is 
divided into eight or sixteen groups, supposed to be suffi- 
ciently homogeneous for the average teacher to give from 
thirty to fifty children adequate training in the elementary- 
school requirements. Our system of grading schools, after 
less than a century of practice, has almost become a fixed 
tradition. Teachers are expected to do well by almost every 
child in a group that may contain mentally superior children 
and morons, retarded children of normal ability, foreigners, 
children with all manner and degree of physical defects, and 
with two or three emotional or moral misfits thrown in to 
keep the teacher in practice on “discipline.” All these 
types are distributed throughout all the rooms in the average 
school, with about an equal number of normal, healthy 
children of about average mental ability, and of a docile 
disposition. 
What is the teacher’s solution? Usually there is a combi- 
nation of special attention and special neglect. Some teach- 
ers, inspired by the bright pupils, give them a chance to lead 
and control all class activities, and leave the “stupids” 
alone except for an occasional question to justify to the 
teacher and pupil alike the foregone conclusion of a sem- 
ester failure and repetition of the work. Other teachers, and 
most commonly this is the case, devote most of the school 
day to trying to help the slower minds up to the average 
performance that is acceptable as “passing,” while the 
bright pupils are left to shift for themselves and to develop
-P-A-G-E-367
  INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTION 353 
gradually but certainly into academic “loafers.” Either 
alternative involves tragedy for some pupils, and a most 
serious social waste. 
The teacher’s excuse is usually that she has done her best 
with the limited time she has, and with the variety of work 
and the large number of pupils she has to look after. She is 
often justified in the claim that she is required to do the 
impossible. But she is also, in most cases, the victim of a 
tradition in her method of working, which would probably 
involve a considerable degree of failure, even if she were 
working under more favorable conditions as far as numbers 
are concerned. 
Readjustments in organization. The recent research and 
experimentation referred to have clearly defined the prob- 
lem of individual differences in children, which makes neces- 
sary an effort at individual treatment for at least one half of 
the present school population, both on the part of the school 
administrator and on the part of the teacher. Several of the 
larger cities of the country have made considerable progress 
in the discovery and definition of the individual differences 
in school children, and in making special arrangements for 
individual treatment based on the results of such analyses. 
Where administrative arrangements have regrouped 
children, it often becomes a problem of selecting special 
teachers for some of the special groups. Such teachers must 
have special interests and sympathies, and usually a special 
technique. Where such arrangements have not been made, 
the teacher is left with a heterogeneous group to which she 
must adapt her methods and devices to meet individual 
needs as best she may. Much of the variety in general 
method can be employed to meet such classroom emergen- 
cies. 
The trends toward individual instruction are found partly 
in the field of methods, and partly in other educational move-
-P-A-G-E-368
354 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
ments. Or, expressing it in another way, we find a number 
of educational activities that are revealing and constantly 
refining the differentiation between individual pupils; and, 
almost as rapidly as these individual differences are being 
revealed, we find progressive administrators and teachers 
making experimental provisions for adjusting the work of 
the schools to these individual differences. 
The discovery of retardation. The first event of impor- | 
tance that showed all was not as it should be with our mass 
education in the public school system was the discovery, in 
1904, by Superintendent Maxwell of New York City, of the 
appalling amount of retardation in the schools of that city. 
When he announced, to a national gathering of superin- 
tendents, that 39 per cent of the New York City children 
were above the normal age for their grades, there was an 
amused expression of condolence that things should be so 
bad in New York, and a large measure of rather smug self- 
congratulation on the part of the other administrators. 
A few went home and began to investigate their own schools, 
and before very long many cities were admitting equal or 
worse conditions. 
Several systematic studies were soon made of retardation. 
The most notable of these, under the direction of Leonard 
P. Ayres, resulted in a report, in 1909,1 which showed that 
in thirty-one leading cities the average proportion of pupils 
who were a year or more behind the grade in which they 
should have been was 33.7 per cent, and that 16 per cent 
of the school children were “repeaters.” Among the im- 
portant causes for retardation found in this extensive study 
were late entrance, irregular attendance, and illness or 
physical defects. It is significant to note that “mental in- 
feriority”” was not included in Ayres’ list of causes. The 
means for discovering this, perhaps the most important of 
1 Ayres, L. P., Laggards in Our Schools.
-P-A-G-E-369
INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTION 355 
all the causes, were just being worked out at that time. 
The work of the French psychologist Binet in testing intelli- 
gence was then just being tried out in a few institutions for 
the feeble-minded in this country. 
Administrative devices to reduce retardation. Among 
the remedies that were suggested for overcoming the waste- 
ful results of mass education, the following were listed by 
Ayres: 
. Better compulsory attendance laws and better enforcement. 
. Better school census methods. 
. Medical inspection.

The result of the exposure proved to be a wholesome one. 
Administrative machinery was renovated, and, most signif- 
icant of all, various experiments were undertaken in the 
more progressive cities, both in the way of improving and 
adjusting the course of study to individual needs and in 
making the grading and promotion more flexible. A number 
of cities were distinguished by having these educational 
schemes become identified with their names, and so we have 
come to speak of the Batavia plan, the Cambridge, St. 
Louis, Santa Barbara, Pueblo, and other city plans. Sey- 
eral convenient descriptions are available, and a detailed 
outline of these schemes is beyond our purpose in the present 
discussion.1 In general these experiments were classified as

Pupils,” in Cubberley’s The Principal and his School.

“flexible promotion schemes” and “differentiated-course 
plans.” ! The solutions combined adjustments in the ad- 
ministration and instruction in various proportions, and, as 
the earlier experiments were adopted in other cities, a great 
variety of combinations and modifications resulted. All 
served the common purpose, however, of giving more and 
more consideration to the individual needs of pupils who, 
for one reason or another, did not fit in readily with the basic 
graded systems or the methods and materials used in group 
instruction. 
Supervised study as an individualizing movement. Su- 
pervised study has already been analyzed fully as a teaching 
method, in Chapter IV. Asa motive for the adoption of the 
method we must recognize it as a development of the move- 
ments outlined in the previous section. The adoption of 
supervised study was generally made, not only because it 
was recognized to possess a more economical and a more 
effective instruction method, but also because it offered a 
still better opportunity for meeting individual differences. 
Each pupil was given a better chance to work at his own 
rate over the same field, or was given such an amount of 
material to study as he was capable of handling in a given 
period. The result was, as has been pointed out, either an 
opportunity for individual promotion at a rate conforming 
to the pupil’s abilities, or an enriched curriculum for the 
more capable ones, if the individual promotion scheme did 
not seem feasible. 
The individual values are more considerable if the admin- 
istrative arrangements are made for flexible promotion, but 
even as an independent classroom method the organization 
is largely intended to obviate the losses due to the group 
recitation, or to the necessity of repeating the work of a 
partial success. Every type of pupil — bright, average, or

dull— can proceed at his own rate over the essential ma- 
terial, and each can get as much supplementary direction 
as he needs to do the work. If the method is in regular use 
there is also the provision for individual testing of results, 
each pupil giving his account for a unit of work as fast as it is 
completed. 
The scientific classification of individual differences. All 
of these movements, at first largely based on the desire to 
reduce retardation and repeating, were given a great rein- 
forcement and expansion by the invention of standardized 
tests. The working out of objective, scientific devices for 
rating every pupil in a group according to his general intelli- 
gence, or his “ability”? to do school work, and according to 
his achievements or attainments in each school subject, 
made the fact of individual differences so exact, so striking, 
and so reliable, that all of the schemes could be carried to a 
much higher degree of effectiveness. 
The revelations as to the enormous range of mental abil- 
ities in any class were astounding, and their range of per- 
formance so remarkable that the trend toward individuali- 
zation was more than justified. The earliest perfected intel- 
ligence test was made public by Binet, in France, in 1907, 
and within a few years these had been introduced into this 
country. Within five years this individual test had been 
greatly improved, and in five more it had been adapted to 
more economical use in the form of group tests, by means of 
which the mental abilities of all individuals in any class 
could be ranked in the few hours taken to give and score the 
tests. The movement for getting an individual rating for 
every pupil in every elementary-school subject was going on 
at the same time. The technique of such testing has now 
been improved to a stage where even particular needs within 
school subjects can be diagnosed for all. In fact, the move- 
ments for the discovery and diagnosis of individual differ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
358 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
ences has gone far beyond our present means to adjust 
either the administrative machinery or the instructional 
methods to the individual needs that have been revealed. 
Methods of tabulation and analysis of the scores made on 
such tests are now beginning to appear, which make it pos- 
sible for a teacher to interpret and follow up the results of 
the standardized tests according to the individual needs that 
are revealed. The work with standardized educational 
tests has gone quite beyond the stage of mere comparison of 
class averages with national standards. The largest use of 
the tests now is this analysis of the individual pupil. 
Special classes and rooms for extreme types. One of the 
most general adjustments to individual differences that has 
grown out of the previous movements is the establishment 
of special rooms and schools for some of the more extreme 
types. There are rooms for feeble-minded, for stupid 
children, and for superior or exceptional children. There 
are rooms for children who have normal or more than normal 
ability, but who have been retarded for other reasons. There 
are rooms for those who need special physical care, the 
tubercular, the crippled, and those otherwise handicapped. 
In most of these special rooms there is not only “type” 
treatment, but also a larger degree of individual attention 
on the educative side. This is due to the fact that such type 
children are usually collected into a special room from vari- 
ous classes, and therefore the group methods of instruction 
cannot be employed. 
In such rooms, designated variously in different cities 
as development, adjustment, opportunity, “express,” and 
“booster” rooms, and by other similar terms, we find a 
special type of teacher, being trained usually by experience, 
and a great deal of special material in the way of devices. 
Some of the best of this material is finding its way into the 
market, and is beginning to be adapted by general-room
-P-A-G-E-373
INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTION 359 
teachers for the individuals of the various types, where the 
school has no provision for special rooms. This is made 
possible because so much of the ingenuity of the special- 
room teachers is being expended to make such materials 
self-directing, and therefore suitable for independent indi- 
vidual use. More and more the teachers are developing 
into supervisors of individual self-activity and self-instruc- 
tion. 
Individual attention for normal children. But the trend 
toward individual instruction has not been confined to the 
atypical, the subnormal, the supernormal, and the retarded. 
These exceptional cases started the movement, but there 
are other activities in the average school system which are 
tending to give more and more individual attention within 
the average, normal group. 
Among these provisions must be classed the rapid spread 
of departmentalization, and especially the spread of the 
junior high-school movement, which finds one of its largest 
justifications in bringing departmental work to the elemen- 
tary-school child. There is an element in this that solves the 
individual-promotion difficulty. Promotion now comes by 
subject, instead of by grade. Irregularities in abilities, 
and individuality in tastes and application, are more easily 
met. 
Allied to the departmental scheme is the extension down- 
ward and the lateral expansion of the elective system. 
-Pupils are given the opportunities to make their own indi- 
vidual adjustments, as far as tastes and needs in subject- 
matter are concerned. 
Along with the elective system there is the rapid expan- 
sion of courses to meet individual needs. The vocational 
education movement in public education has this recogni- 
tion of individual differences in mind, as well as the intent of 
social, economic service to the community. The training 
 
-P-A-G-E-374

360 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
for a trade is now offered in such variety, in the larger cities, 
that individual tastes and ambitions can be met. 
Vocational guidance. Along with this extension of elec- 
tives in the senior and junior high schools, and the offering 
of opportunities for vocational training, there has developed 
the movement for vocational and educational guidance. 
The opportunities are so varied, and the selection of a trade 
or profession is requiring such high degrees of specializa- 
tion, that pupils are being forced to make important individ- 
ual decisions as to courses and subjects before they have suf- 
ficient. perspective to make such decisions wisely. The 
needed guidance cannot be given intelligently by parents, 
and even the general faculty advisers are no longer consid- 
ered adequate to give such advice expertly. Vocational 
and educational counselors, with the machinery for getting 
and keeping complete individual records, are now relied 
on in many progressive communities to give this advice. 
Usually such guidance is given in connection with the public 
schools, and the larger high schools, junior and senior, are 
undertaking this service for the community and for the 
individual. 
Individual trends in the project method of instruction. 
Besides all the arrangements, largely of an administrative 
nature, that have been discussed as contributing to a larger 
and larger recognition of, and provision for, individual dif- 
ferences, there are also several important movements in the 
purely instructional field that have tended to place large 
emphasis on the individual. The supervised study move- 
ment, which combines both administrative and instructional 
features contributing to the Seek acl oi: trend, has al- 
ready been discussed. 
Another of the prominent new methods, though it was 
not primarily introduced for this purpose, has large individ- 
ual instruction values and possibilities. The project or the 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
  INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTION 361 
project-problem method was largely developed to bring more 
real-life materials and activities into the school. It has been 
found, too, in the working out of laboratory problems, and in 
the field and shop projects, in agriculture, domestic science, 
and the manual arts and trade courses, that most satisfac< 
tory results can be obtained if each pupil works independ- 
ently. Under such circumstances it soon transpires that, 
with the individual rates of working, different pupils will 
soon be working at different tasks, even though they may 
have started on a common program. The same condition is 
a natural one when the problem or project method is carried 
over into the more academic subjects. Again the teacher 
becomes an adviser and supervisor of individual learning 
units. 
Actual individual-instruction experiments. Finally we 
must note that some school leaders who were in a position to 
do so have made extensive out-and-out experiments with 
individual instruction. A number of private institutions 
have advertised the success of such schemes, and their suc- 
cesses have been approved and commended by enthusiastic 
educators ! for imitation in the public schools. 
One of these experiments has been carried on for several 
years under public school conditions. In the city school 
system at Winnetka, Illinois, a complete scheme of individ- 
ual instruction has been carried on for some years. The 
superintendent of schools has been most enthusiastic in his 
claims of results, and a number of critical visitors have given 
the experiment a rich measure of praise. 
One of the significant phases of this experiment has been 
the energetic effort made to get out textbooks and study- 
guides, and a variety of practice materials of the self- 
directing type, that could be put into the hands of children 
so that they would be largely independent in their study.

-P-A-G-E-376
  362 PROGRESSIVE METHODS OF TEACHING 
Some of this material has been published for general use in 
the schools. The demand for it has reached considerable 
proportions. 
Much of this individual instruction trend is incidental. 
In conclusion it must again be stressed that, while some of 
these movements have the conscious aim of giving individual 
attention in instruction, most of these movements were 
started to meet other needs, and the emphasis on the indi- 
vidual has been an incidental by-product. The various 
promotional schemes were intended to diminish the waste 
of the lock-step system. Departmentalized teaching was 
largely intended to furnish pupils with better teachers be- 
cause they could specialize in their preparation and in their 
work on a single subject. The elective system was intended 
to place the opportunities for a practical or vocational train- 
ing alongside of the traditional classical course. Supervised 
study was intended primarily to diminish the waste of the 
recitation-testing method. Intelligence tests were first 
evolved to locate and isolate feeble-minded children from 
the general group. Other school tests were first suggested 
and used as a supervisory device, to see whether teachers 
were keeping their classes up to national standards. Most 
of the types of special rooms were started to take the diffi- 
cult problems off the hands of the regular room teacher, and 
to reduce the grade group to a more homogeneous average. 
Vocational education and vocational guidance were largely 
introduced to promote economic efficiency, and to supply a 
substitute for former methods of trade training that were 
falling into disuse because of industrial conditions. 
Yet all of these movements have made their peculiar con- 
tributions to the development of two general trends in the 
public school, both of which are already radically modifying 
mass education. These trends are: (1) the discovery and 
diagnosis of individual differences in abilities, needs, and
-P-A-G-E-377
INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTION 368 
| performances; and (2) the adjustment of the work of the 
classroom to these individual needs and abilities by a rapidly 
- increasing development of individual instruction.

14. Why is the textbook-recitation-testing method so wasteful and inefli- 
cient? 
This common, primitive method of teaching may be modified and im- 
proved in two general ways: (a) By improving the methods of testing 
pupils; (6) by supplementing textbook teaching by other general 
methods. 
. How may our methods of testing pupils be improved? 
. Why are the new testing devices more effective? 
. What general methods may be used to supplement work with the 
textbook? Which of these are to be thought of as purely supplemen- 
tary? Which are to be thought of as substitutes for the textbook 
method? 
. For what particular type of subject-matter is the inductive-develop- 
ment method specially suitable? 
. Why is it ridiculous to plan an appreciation lesson on the plan of the 
“formal steps”’ of the inductive lesson? 
. Make a list of five problems that could best be taught by the project 
method. Then make a list of five problems that could not be taught 
by the project method, but could be taught by the problem method. 
. Could any of the problems in this list be taught by the project method? 
. What is the difference between the object lesson and the project 
method? 
Have any of the fundamental principles of this book been taught by 
the object lesson method? 
To what extent should the selection of general methods enter into a 
teacher’s semester planning? 
Why should a teacher experiment with a variety of methods when she 
is sure she already has a successful method? 
To what extent may the nature of the subject-matter determine the

the general methods; find sections in the various chapters which refer 
to this relationship; make a list of subject-matter topics specially 
suited to each of the general methods. Start your comparison with 
considering the inductive, appreciation, and drill methods. 
Why are the collateral reading and the lecture and discussion methods 
the easiest to make a beginning in breaking away from the textbook- 
recitation-testing method? 
What is the psychological basis for a fearless emphasis on drill work in 
connection with much of the work in the elementary grades? 
Show that habit learning is more important than content learning in 
connection with oral and written expression. 
Would it be possible to determine by true experimentation that cor- 
rection of written compositions by the teacher does or does not result 
in correctness of expression on the part of pupils? How? 
Make a list of experiments suggested in the text and add several other 
experiments in method you think it would be interesting to make. 
In what other way, besides the problem method here used, could a 
review be worked out for this course?

  ACKNOWLEDGMENT 
When I first gathered data and material of various 
sorts on art subjects it was wholly for my own use in 
classwork without a thought of publication at the time. 
Often at lectures or from my reading I jotted down 
things worth while and in this way collected many 
valuable notes to which, however, I did not always 
append the name of the speaker or writer. Hence the 
frequent quotation marks and seeming inconsistency 
in crediting source. 
In freely using the words of others and passing on 
their thought, I feel that I am enlisting their various 
services in the great cause of good citizenship. 
To the many who have thus contributed so much 
valuable material my grateful acknowledgment is ten- 
dered.

  FOREWORD 
“Art should not be for the few any more than lib- 
erty is for the few.” Educators are beginning to 
realize more and more the truth of this creed of 
William Morris. Educationally, it should be made 
impossible for anyone to deprecate the fact that he 
“knows nothing about art.” /The power to feel and 
to express, to judge and to execute, lies dormant in 
every soul; in some to a greater degree than in others 
Those with the greater inherited capacity and better 
training will become creative artists, perhaps; but all 
may become, at least to some extent, users of good 
judgment and taste. So intimately are we in touch 
with art principles in our daily lives, that we con- 
stantly use or misuse them/ 
With practical art training, there is no reason why 
any boy who grows up to be a carpenter should not 
know that a door or window that equals two squares 
is a commonplace proportion, nor is there any reason 
‘why the president of a bank or the superintendent of 
a school who engages the carpenter should not know. 
that the portico of his house is ill proportioned and 
why, should it be so. With practical art training, 
every girl should know how to dress simply and in 
good taste, and knowledge of color harmony should 
be general. The wish to have a well-planned, beauti- 
ful city is a matter of training, education; and the wish 
is father to the thought.

  Foreword 
  The course of study, as outlined here, is designed 
to give a general training or appreciation to those who 
will have no further opportunity to study the subject; 
or, preferably, it may supplement exercises in design 
or art structure. The somewhat prevalent idea that 
art appreciation means the appreciation of pictures 
only, influences us, perhaps, to take up pictorial art 
last. Such subjects as city planning, landscape gar- 
dening, house decoration, and costume design are too 
little thought of in connection with art principles. 
This outline is meant to be suggestive, flexible, to 
point out the way, and to stimulate the desire for orig- 
inal research work. Its study may be taken up by 
individuals, but the best results are to be obtained 
working in groups under leadership. It has been 
found very helpful, in this sort of study, to keep note- 
books wherein findings of various sorts, clippings, 
magazine illustrations, etc., may be kept. Each note- 
book should be the expression of the taste, judgment, 
and the sense of value of its owner. There should 
be individual choice in the matter of tracings, clip- 
pings, etc., so that each notebook shall be characteristic 
of its owner, and, therefore, the more interesting. 
Following the approved method of modern ped- 
agogy, the student should be encouraged by the teacher 
or leader of a group to inquire into all reference mate- 
rial and to collect his own data as far as possible. 
The bibliography at the end of each subject should 
be added to from time to time, as new works on the 
subject are published.

GENERAL THEORY OF ART 
The Three Elements Structural Principles: 
of Art: 1. Symmetry or Balance 
1. Line 2. Repetition or Rhythm 
2. Tone 3. Opposition 
3. Color 4. Transition 
5. Subordination 
GENERAL DEFINITION OF ART 
Art in one word: Arrangement. 
Question: Arrangement of what? 
Answer: The three elements— Line, Tone, Color. 
Question: Arranged how? 
Answer: According to certain laws or principles, 
namely, Opposition, Repetition, etc. 
USES OF ART 
1. To the Community (city planning, landscape 
gardening, etc.). 
2. To the Home (house construction and decora- 
tion, etc.). 
t 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  2 Better Citizenshiz 
3. To the Individual (costume design, developmen: 
of good taste). 
4. As Pictorial Expression (from both the creative 
and appreciative standpoints). 
METHOD OF APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF ART 
The old academic method contrasted with the new 
synthetic or compositional method: 
The one method makes drawing an end in itself 
and many years are spent working from the cast and 
life, composition being a mere by-product. 
The other method designs to trafn the creative and 
inventive powers with which all normal individuals are 
endowed, and to put drawing in its rightful place as a 
means to an end—a very necessary and important, but 
nevertheless rightly considered tool. 
“Drawing is the tool by which ideas are expressed.” 
“Drawing is only one application of art.” 
“ Choosing is the field of art.” 
“Nature drawing has nothing to do with the culti- 
vation of fine choices.” 
“ Choice is the concomitant of art.” 
“Separation of design and drawing is a fatal thing.” 
«“Art is built up of certain uses of order” (arrange- 
ment). 
“Art, after all, in its largest sense, lies in a peculiar, 
harmonious use of spacing.” 
The great purpose of art instruction is to train 
judgment — cultivate the appreciation for what is good

1The Indian woman or Oriental rug-maker has an art education 
that few acquire even with years of training. The constant choices 
made in weaving a blanket or basket or rug as to this width or space, 
this dark or light, this color or that—this constant appeal to judg- 
ment develops the power of discrimination. If then, we can provide 
opportunity for making choices, we are educating along this line. 
Therefore, exercises in original design, and more exercises in original 
design! Not only for creative work, but for true appreciation also, 
the element of participation is necessary; therefore, again, exercises — 
opportunities for choice-making. (Note assignments under Line, Tone, 
and Color.)

THE THREE ELEMENTS 
I, Line: By Line is meant spacing. A good line 
composition is one that is broken up into well-related 
spaces. 
By analysis of the line composition of great mas- 
terpieces in painting, architecture, etc., and by consult- 
ing our own feeling in original exercises, we find that 
beauty of line composition is the result of variety of 
shapes and sizes of spaces and a harmonious relation 
of these. 
“The term Line refers to boundaries of shapes and 
the interrelation of lines and spaces.” 
Illustrative. matter in the way of photographs, or 
tracings of the main spacings of great cathedrals, etc., 
should be used to explain this element of art to class. 
Assignment: a. Make tracings of the spacings of 
facades of buildings, masterpieces in painting, sculp- 
ture; also illustrative material from the different 
crafts: tracings or clippings of weavings, furniture, 
metal work, etc. 
b. Original line designs or exercises in square, ob- 
long, and circle.

SIGNIFIGANEE @F LINE BIRESTION 
1. Vertical Line: Majesty, dignity, grandeur, cour- 
age, sternness, sublimity, austerity, etc. 
Example in nature: Tall forest trees. 
Example in architecture: Great columns, etc. 
2. Horizontal Line: Rest, calmness, serenity, peace, 
quiet, tranquillity, death, finality. 
Example in nature: Horizon line on plain or ocean 
when calm. 
Example in architecture: Long, low lines of bunga- 
low, etc. ’ 
3. Oblique Line: Motion, movement, joy, horror, 
treachery, threat, anxiety, weirdness, etc. The zigzag 
line, a line of action and violence —the “busy line.” 
Example: The ocean in storm, lightning, etc. 
4. The Curve Line: Beauty, grace, elegance. Re- 
strained curves more beautiful and refined. Half of 
circumference, a commonplace curve. 
Example: The human body, etc. 
Eye follows leading line in a composition. 
Assignment: Paste in notebooks clippings of mag- 
azines illustrating “significance of Line.” 
II. Tone: Notan, which means “dark, light,’ is 
the Japanese word for this element of art. By Tone 
is meant the amount and quality of Dark-and. 
Light in a composition. We are not to confuse the 
term Light-and-Shade with Dark-and-Light. (Dow, 
Composition, chap. 1x.) Value is another word for 
Tone. Expression, ‘‘ out of value’? means wrong rela- 
tions of tones.  
-P-A-G-E-20
  Better Citizenship 
  The acquiring of beautiful tone relationship is a mat- 
ter of feeling rather than of rule. The feeling is de- 
veloped by original exercises and by the constant use 
of critical judgment with regard to works of art. Orig- 
inal exercises, therefore, important. Necessity also 
for having at hand examples of great art in all periods. 
It is a scientific fact that the smallest amount of dark 
in a light composition or the smallest amount of light 
in a dark composition attracts the eye. This fact is 
used either consciously or unconsciously by great mas- 
ters to lead the eye toward the important part of the 
design. i 
Assignment: Scale of values. Clippings for note- 
book, examples of good tone relationship—some 
showing values closely related; others, strong contrast. 
Original exercises in Dark-and-Light. 
III. Color: Color has three attributes: hue, as red 
or blue; value or notan, as dark red, light blue, etc.; 
intensity, as bright red, dull blue, etc. 
Old theory of three primary colors. A good work- 
ing theory. 
The Munsell theory: 
Yellow 
    Hue Value Intensity or chroma
-P-A-G-E-21
    Through Art Training i 
Color Combinations: 
1. All in one hue. 
2. Pure hues nearly related. 
3. Pure hues contrasted in subordinate relation. 
4. Pure hues used with black or white. 
5. Pure hues used with neutral. 
6. Hues harmonized by common hue running 
throughout. 
For Closer Harmonies: 
1. Hues of middle intensity or chroma (so-called 
“pastel shades’’). 
2. Hues in low chroma (comparable in refinement 
to low voice in speaking, slow dance, etc.). 
3. To balance neutralized tints use small amount 
of brilliant color. Brilliant hues have a very limited 
use. Three hues suffice for almost any color scheme. 
Dependence of the three elements upon each 
other: Color upon Dark-and-Light, or Tone, and 
Tone again upon Line. 
Assignment:s If water colors or crayons may be 
used, | scales of hue, value, and i intensity made for note- 
books. Experiment with complementary and adjacent 
hues. Clippings from color reproductions in magazines 
or bits of textiles pasted in notebooks to illustrate color 
combinations above.

STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES 
First and foremost is the great fundamental, under- 
lying principle of proportion. 
Test with regard to feeling for good proportion: 
Have students draw, or tear from paper, what seems 
to each a well-proportioned rectangle. Ask that best 
judgment be used. Now direct that a dotted line be 
drawn or the paper folded through the middle short- 
wise the rectangle, thus: 
Ask how many find that their rectangle is equal to 
two squares. Call attention to the fact that an area 
equal to two squares is a commonplace proportion. If 
rectangle is equal to three squares, still not a good pro- 
portion, though better than two. 
For further exercise or test:. Have students draw 
two or more straight lines, as for a border, across the 
two shorter ends, choosing where they will place them. 
This Not Compare results.
-P-A-G-E-23
  Call attention to the interest which variety of spacing 
gives. 
PRINCIPLES OF COMPOSITION OR DESIGN; OR WAYS OF 
CREATING HARMONY 
1. Symmetry: Two or more sides alike —balance. 
One of the most obvious ways of creating harmony. 
Examples: The human body, furniture, pottery, etc. 
2. Repetition: Marching, rhythm. The produc- 
tion of beauty by using the same lines, unit, or motif 
over and over again in rhythmical order. One of the 
oldest forms of design—the basis of all music and 
poetry. 
Examples: Pattern designs on pottery, textiles, etc. 
The swastika unit found in designs of all primitive 
peoples. (This principle the opposite of subordina- 
tion. ) 
3. Opposition: The meeting of two lines at right 
or nearly right angles. A most severe and simple 
harmony. Also opposition in Tone; in Color. : 
Examples: Doorways, windows, Greek, Egyptian, 
and early Renaissance architecture. 
4. Transition: A softening of the severity of oppo- 
sition. The eye is led less abruptly from one point of 
composition to another by addition of a third line or 
other feature. Also transition of Tone; of Color. 
Examples: The capital in architecture, bracket, 
drapery in costumes, etc. 
5. Subordination (sometimes called Principality) : 
A principle which has developed with civilization. An
-P-A-G-E-24
    10 Better Citizenship Through Art Training 
emphasizing or stressing of one part of composition at 
expense of another in order to bring about unity. 
There may be: 
1. Subordination to an axis, as branches of tree 
to trunk, 
2. Subordination to a center, as rosette. 
3. Subordination by size or interest as the 
predominance of main entrance of cathe- 
dral over side doorways, etc. 
Subordination may be used in Tone and Color as 
well as in Line. 
Assignment: Find a number of examples illustrat- 
ing each principle. Clippings from magazines, tracings, 
etc.

CITY PLANNING 
Era of city is just beginning — humanity must solve 
the problem of the city. 
I 
“WHAT Is CITY PLANNING? City Planning is the 
name given to the science and art of providing for the 
most practicable and agreeable development of a city 
or town. City Planning would not usurp the functions 
of existing city departments or civic organizations, but 
it would harmonize their conflicting projects and evolve 
in cooperation with them a comprehensive plan for the 
best economic, social, and esthetic development of the 
community as a whole. 
“City Planning would first investigate all of the 
physical ills of a community; it would diagnose them; it 
would determine all those matters which need improve- 
ment; it would determine, in consideration of all points 
of view, the relative urgency of the various needs; it 
would plan in view of this a consistent program of pro- 
cedure; it would work out solutions for all of these 
problems, keeping a due relation and proportion among 
them; it would meet the peculiar needs of the com- 
munity and preserve the city’s individuality; it would 
concentrate on the various problems in turn and get 
tangible results. 
“City Planning is not a squandering of the city’s 
3
-P-A-G-E-28
  14 Better Citizenship 
  money on vague splendid dreams, but, in recognition 
of the fact that good design costs little, if any, more 
than bad design, City Planning would insist on such 
taste and dignity in the design of all that which affects 
the appearance of the city that the citizens would have 
just cause to glory in its beauty.” — GerorcE B, Forp. 
“ City Planning —an altruism that guards the rights 
of the future as well as those of the present genera- 
tion.’ — Henry C. WRIGHT. 
“City Planning is the application of wise fore- 
thought to the control of a city’s destiny. 
“City Planning attracts industries, commerce, and 
visitors; it produces better transportation facilities, im- 
proved hygienic conditions, more adequate and less 
expensive living quarters, and food supplies. It de- 
velops artistic taste, civic pride, and patriotism, it 
makes better citizens and artisans, it creates health, 
comfort, happiness; it helps to increase the population 
and to produce industrial prosperity. City Planning is 
a business proposition of the first importance. It is 
real civilization.” — FRANK KOESTER. 
“The ideal of City Planning will be reached when 
cities are built upon the broad basis of the common 
welfare of the human race, not to gratify the vanity 
of autocrats, or to create wealth and power for the 
favored few through the concerted energy of the cit- 
izen masses, but to gratify the wish and confirm the 
right of those citizen masses to enjoy their just sharé 
of the fruits of their united efforts and the amenities 
that are the just reward of civic and social duties well 
and faithfully performed.” —B. A. HoLpEMan.
-P-A-G-E-29
  Through Art Training 15 
_ “City Planning would so model the setting of the 
life of the community with regard to health, safety, 
convenience, and comfort as to make it the ideal place 
in which to live. Than this there is nothing of which 
a city may be more proud.” — Georce B. Forp. 
“Until our streets are decent and orderly, and our 
town gardens break the bricks and mortar every here 
and there, and are open to all people; until our mead- 
ows even near our towns become fair and sweet, and 
are unspoiled by patches of hideousness; until we have 
clear sky above our heads and green grass beneath 
our feet; until the great drama of the seasons can touch 
our workmen with other feelings than the misery of 
winter and the weariness of summer; till all this hap- 
pens, our museums and art schools will be but amuse- 
ments of the rich; and they will soon cease to be of any 
use to them also, unless they make up their minds to 
give us back the fairness of the Earth.” — WILLIAM 
Morris. 
City Planning Means: 
1. Conservation of human energy and life — 
Not merely SUPERFICIAL beautification. 
2. A definite plan of orderly development into which 
each improvement will fit as is needed — 
Not the immediate execution of the whole plan. 
3. Business methods for city work — 
Not the surrender of the city to artists with vague 
schemes for civic adornment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
16 : Better Citizenship 
4. Correlation of city’s activities — 
Not wholesale alterations at great expense with 
no assured financial returns. 
5. Encouragement of commerce and facilitation of 
business — 
Not the interruption of commerce and business. 
6. Preservation of historic buildings with their as- 
sociations — 
Not the destruction of old landmarks and city 
individuality. 
7. The development of an American city — 
Not the imitation of London, Paris, Vienna. 
8. Exercise of common foresight and prudence — 
Not ruinous expense and debt. 
9. Happiness, convenience, health for all citizens — 
Not expensive boulevards and parks available 
only to the rich.— ARTHUR C. COMEY.

B. City Building in Ancient Times: (Further re- 
search work suggested—notes to be taken by 
entire class from findings of those having assign- 
ments. ) 
. Sites — fortifications — plans. 
2. Babylon: First city laid off according to definite 
plans; Queen Semiramis. 
3. Athens:. Planned by Pericles; Acropolis; Phid- 
ias; Parthenon. Civilization never equaled. 
. Rome: In its early days squalid. Victorious 
generals. National pride born. The Caesars. 
First city to realize that city must provide for 
health and convenience of its people: 
(15 B. c.) Population 1,630,000. 
Eight great spaces set apart for games. 
Eighteen public squares. 
Thirty parks, great temples and their courts. 
Baths—with accommodations for 62,800.

ment, General Federation of Women’s Clubs.) NN S 
C. City Building in Europe: (Assignment as before.) 
1. Paris: Best example of successful City Planning. 
Planned by Louis x1v (1700 a.p.). Later Napo- 
leon did much for city: first sidewalks, street 
lights, bridges, etc. Baron Haussmann and what 
he did for city. Two hundred and sixty-five mil- 
lion dollars spent on completing plans —has been 
good investment.

2. London: (7,000,000 population). Suffers for 
lack of City Planning. Contrasted with Paris. 
Futile desires of Sir Christopher Wren. London 
has spent millions trying to undo, and has pro- 
duced the most degraded and socially dangerous 
population on earth. London Traffic Commission 
has recently decided that two new streets must be 
cut through city—estimated cost $125,000,000 
for land damages alone. 
3. Germany: Much interested in City Planning. 
Has only university for study of city building. 
Many cities planning for future. Dusseldorf 
(300,000) has plans for fifty years to come: upon 
maps in city hall future streets, parks, public build- 
ings, etc., can be located. All this planning for 
constructive work, however, did not prevent the 
initiation of, and participation in the greatest 
destructive work of the ages in the late war. 
Think what it might have meant to the world 
if these four years had been devoted to ‘‘con- 
servation of human energy and life” and to “‘an 
altruism that guards the rights of the future as 
well as those of the present generation.” 
D. City Building in America: (Assignment as be- 
fore. Plans of cities in book or pamphlet form 
may be secured. Also guidebooks with maps.) 
I. Washington: Best-laid-out city in United States. 
Planned by L’Enfant. 
2. New York: Gridiron plan—upper part. Broad- 
way.

3. Philadelphia: Checkerboard, or gridiron. 
4. Indianapolis: Several diagonal streets focussing. 
5- Chicago: Has adopted plans— idea inspired by 
World’s Columbian Exposition (1893). Plans 
completed in 1909. School children study text- 
book, Wacker’s Manual of the Plan of Chicago. 
There are in the United States sixty-one cities and 
towns engaged in City Planning.1 These are scattered 
throughout the country and have in almost every in- 
stance employed experts to guide them in their work. 
E. City Keeping as Important as City Building: 
(Assignments: Research work.) 
. City sanitation. 
. Smoke nuisance. 
. Overhead wires. 
. Street noises. 
. Unsightly water-fronts. 
. Objectionable billboards, signs. 
. Parks, playgrounds. SIAN

1. What we need. 
2. Have we an Art Commission? 
3. Have we Civic Improvement Clubs in different 
wards? 
4. What can we do to help?

CITY PLANNING AN APPLICATION OF ART PRINCIPLES 
1. Design in City Planning: Spacing, proportion. 
Principle of subordination. Civic Center and lesser 
groups. Rosette form of ideal city. Accents of 
interest, such as schoolhouses and other public build- 
ings scattered throughout city. Orderly arrangement 
of street plan and park system. Color— Jules 
Guerin and the Panama Pacific Exposition. 
“Beauty is to be desired and sought for in the de. 
sign of any and all parts of the system of circulation, in 
streets, in railway buildings, in cars, and the alignmeni 
of the very tracks themselves, but not as somethin) 
to be applied like a pink ribbon which a designer 
insensitive to beauty, may hire some other man t 
tie upon his previously created and otherwise un: 
lovely work. . . . . To obtain the best results 
regard for beauty must neither precede nor follow re:
-P-A-G-E-37

gard for the practical ends to be obtained, but must 
accompany it step by step. 
“The demands of beauty are in large measure iden- 
tical with those of efficiency and economy and differ 
merely in requiring a closer approach to practical per- 
fection in the adaptation of means to ends than is re- 
quired to meet the merely economic standard. So far 
as the demands of beauty can be distinguished from 
those of economy the kind of beauty most to be sought 
in the planning of cities is that which results from 
seizing instinctively, with a keen and sensitive apprecia- 
tion, the limitless opportunities which present them- 
selves in the course of the most rigorously practical 
solution of any problem for a choice between decisions 
of substantially equal economic merit but of widely dif- 
fering esthetic quality.”.— FREDERICK L. OLMSTED. 
2. What is Civic Art? 
(Exhibit of civic art, photographs, illustrations, 
clippings, and sketches, arranged on mounting 
boards and accompanied with lectures and bibliogra- 
phy may be had from Art Department, General Fed- 
eration of Women’s Clubs.) 
“So long as art is regarded as a trimming, a spe- 
cies of crochet-work to be stitched in ever-increasing 
quantities to the garments of life, it is vain to expect 
its true importance to be recognized. Civic art is too 
often understood to consist in filling our streets with 
marble fountains, dotting our squares with groups of 
statuary, twining our lamp-posts with wriggling acan-
-P-A-G-E-38
  24 Better Citizenship   
  thus leaves or dolphin’s tails, and our buildings with 
meaningless bunches of fruit and flowers tied up with 
impossible stone ribbons.” — RAYMOND UNWIN. 
Civic art is a matter of construction; fundamental 
form; design; plan; not a matter of superficial and 
often superfluous adornment. 
In this connection, consider the axiom that ‘‘ we may 
decorate construction, but never construct decoration.” 
Organizations such as Civic Improvement Clubs are 
often short-lived and seemingly futile because their 
aims are superficial. The planting of vines and rose 
bushes to hide unsightly and often insanitary conditions 
is the work of well-meaning perhaps, but nevertheless 
misguided enthusiasts. ‘‘ Beauty cannot easily be en- 
grafted upon rottenness.” 
VI 
SOCIALIZING INFLUENCE OF CITY PLANNING 
By improving civic conditions we do not mean the 
advancement of beauty alone; civic art represents a 
moral, intellectual, and administrative progress. — 
Joun W. WIEsE. 
1, Improved Municipal Housekeeping — “ Municipal 
Socialism.” 
a. Control: Sewer system, water supply, streets, 
housing conditions, disposal of garbage, smoke 
nuisance, general sanitary and living conditions. 
b. Provide: Protection against fire, park systems, 
free school system, public playgrounds, free libra-

ries, free art galleries and museums, municipal 
theaters, public baths, and gymnasiums — proper 
environment in which to develop life and char- 
acter. 
c. Development of suburbs through rapid transit, 
public service, and privately owned cars. 
2. Influence of Study of City Planning in Schools: 
a. Gives intelligent conception of meaning of City 
Planning as a modern movement. 
b. Great opportunities for correlation with history, 
geography, and the industries. (Investigate work 
of Newark, N. J.) 
c. A very practical reason for study of art princi- 
ples. 
d. Cultivation of civic pride and responsibility : 
1. Children in Chicago schools study plan of their 
city. 
2. “In New York City the time is fast approach- 
ing when the citizens will be called upon to vote 
upon matters which will bear the name of City 
Planning.” 
In this connection it is most interesting to 
note the oath taken in recent years by grad- 
uates of New York City College. This oath 
(almost verbatim the old Greek oath taken by 
the ephebi in Athens) is as follows: 
“*We, men of the class of 19—, today re- 
ceiving the arms of the city as a symbol of her 
faith in us, take this oath of devotion to her: 
“<We will never bring disgrace to these arms
-P-A-G-E-40

. Responsibility of all. 
  Better Citizenship 
by any act of dishonesty or cowardice. We 
will never desert our suffering comrades in the 
ranks. We will fight for the ideals and sacred 
things of the city both alone and with many. 
We will revere and obey the city’s laws and do 
our best to incite a like respect and reverence in 
those about us who are prone to set them at 
naught. We will strive ever to do our whole 
duty as citizens, and thus in all these ways to 
transmit this city not only not less, but greater, 
better, and more beautiful than it was trans- 
mitted to us.’” 
“tis we ourselves, 
each one of us, who must keep watch and ward 
over the fairness of the earth, and each with 
his own soul and hand do his share therein 
lest we deliver to our sons a lesser treasure 
than our fathers left to us.” — WILLIAM 
Morais.

GARDEN CITIES 
This is the essence of the Garden City movement 
— “to give to every inhabitant an interest in his hold- g J 
ings.’ — ESTHER MATSON. 
The Garden City movement originated in England. 
A book by Ebenezer Howard, published in 1898, en- 
titled Garden Cities of Tomorrow, is credited with 
being the inspiration of the movement. In rgot, a 
group of idealists decided to translate the book into 
reality—they would create a town where there would 
be “fresh air, sunlight, breathing room, and playing 
room.” Thus was born the first Garden City, Letch- 
worth. 
Garden City movement now enrolls twenty societies 
in England alone.

LANDSCAPE GARDENING 
Seen through each arch of pale green leaves, the gate 
Of Eden swings apart for Summer’s royal state. 
— ALFRED NOYES. 
Landscape Gardening is of two kinds, formal and 
informal. 
I. The formal has several characteristics: 
1. It shows man’s mastery over nature —clipped 
hedges; carefully placed shrubbery; vistas shown 
here or screened there; the use of garden fur- 
nishings, such as statuary, marble terraces, per- 
golas, etc. 
The design of the formal garden is at once ap- 
parent—is characterized by unity—has one 
dominant idea: perhaps a water garden with foun- 
tains and pools, or a rose garden with pergola or 
summer-house as center of interest. Its design 
may be a thing apart from, and independent of 
any architectural features, or may be a setting for 
some mansion. 
3. The formal garden gives wide scope for the ex- 
pression of individuality. The personality of the 
designer, his tastes and modes of thinking are 
everywhere evident. The garden speaks of the 
master-mind that conceived it; but also of the nN
-P-A-G-E-49
Through Art Training 35 
master-doer who tends, guides, encourages, and 
restrains its growth. 
4. The formal garden must have an enclosure of 
wall or hedge. There must always be a definite 
boundary or outline. This limitation of a given 
space is characteristic of all gardens of this style. 
II. Informal Gardens: 
1. Need not be enclosed. They may wander on over 
hill and dale and, as a rule, cover considerably 
more ground. 
2. The design in this sort of garden need not be at 
once noticeable. 
3. Are not an instance of the will of man superim- 
posed upon nature, but rather nature deferentially 
assisted and gently led. 
4. This last type of garden is much more restful; is 
more practical and less expensive; is better for 
the masses. 
Of the two styles of gardening, the formal is best 
typified by the wonderful Italian gardens. The infor- 
mal garden is represented most satisfactorily, perhaps, 
by the great English estates, and England is called the 
most beautiful country in the world because of the 
number of these estates and their general continuity. 
PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN APPLIED TO LANDSCAPE

roportion in planning or spacing. Beautiful leading

“Ancients regarded nature as servant not mistress, 
and indulged little sentiment for nature in the abstract.” 
They did not seek to counterfeit meadows, forests, etc., 
but each garden was designed as decorative setting to 
palace or villa. Symmetry, order, balance, contrast 
— evidence of nature subdued to human control.

IV. Gardens of Renaissance: (Reconstruction of, or 
development from old Roman gardens)— ex- 
tremely formal. Not, however, until 1540 did any 
garden receive the form that we know today. 
Italian Villa Garden: Not a park or reserved terri- 
tory. Designedly an artificial creation, an artistic 
ensemble of which house and gardens are distinct 
} and complementary parts—the whole treated as 
a decorative composition.

and scattered elements of preceding practice.”

VI. English Gardens: 
A Frenchman has said, ‘There is nothing easier 
than to lay out an English garden: one has only to 
make the gardener drunk and then follow his 
meanderings.”’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  Through Art Training 41 
1. Character: Sloping lawns and meandering paths. 
“As exponents of the art and science of landscape 
gardening, French and Italian examples are su- 
perior to English, but for mere lovable beauty, 
fitting the needs of the true country lover, nothing 
can approach the English garden.” 
Love of nature, as nature — modern sentiment 
due to influence of poets of eighteenth and nine- 
teenth centuries. The English a sport-loving peo- 
ple. Direct response to need: the bowling green, 
croquet ground, lawn-tennis court, etc. Common 
sense and thrift, also characteristic of English 
people. . Therefore their belief in satisfying need 
rather than supplying luxury. Approaches and 
courts—fore-court; kitchen-court. Great care 
given English gardens. 
The English longing for nature unrestrained. 
In almost every place of size some wilderness — 
some copse. There is always, however, transition 
through pasture land. 
2. Two aims in laying out English garden: 
a. To give, by occasional long vistas, a sense of 
size. 
b. To give, by screened enclosures and half-con- 
cealed exits, a sense of privacy. Stimulus to 
imagination—element of the unexpected in 
most interesting gardens. 
3. Influence of Sir Christopher Wren (classic plan- 
ning): Introduced formal terrace, walled gar- 
dens, clipped hedges, architectural accessories. cs Influence of Brown —slogan “imitate nature.”

Influence of Kemp—advocated formal treat- 
ment about house, more natural away from 
house. 
4. Famous English estates. 
5. Public parks and gardens. 
VII. Japanese Gardens: 
Japanese gardens are (1) finished, (2) intermedi- 
ary, or (3) rough. They may be flat or a part of 
a hillside. 
Symbolic treatment. 
Temple gardens. Teahouse gardens. 
Garden Accessories: Stones, bridges, arbors, gate- 
ways, trees, stone lanterns, and usually three 
knolls or hillocks.

2. Old-fashioned southern gardens. 
3. Small home grounds — rules for planning: 
a. Keep center of lawn open. 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  Through Art Training 43 
b. Plant in masses. 
c. Avoid too many straight lines. 
d. Fill in angles—transition of line. 
4. Well-known estates. 
5. Public parks—community gardens —play- 
grounds. Democratic conception of the garden of 
the future, ‘‘ For whereas the gardens of the past 
belonged to the few, the gardens of the future will 
belong to the many.” It seems that Bacon’s 
prophecy, “men come to build stately sooner than 
to garden finely,” has in part come true. But now, 
since man has solved his steel-construction prob- 
lem will he not turn his inventive genius to gar- 
dening, and the making perhaps of many Garden 
Cities ?

ARCHITECTURE 
Architectural styles grow out of human needs and 
aspirations. 
I. Primarily: The character of architecture due to 
climatic conditions: 
Grass huts of Ethiopians 
1. Inthe Tropics;Tents of Arabs 
Dome-crowned buildings of Orient 
2. Northern Shores of {Colonnades of Greece 
Mediterranean | Open courtyards 
3. Temperate Zone: Buildings with many open- 
ings; doors and windows to be opened and 
closed at will. 
4. Arctic Region: Igloo or ice hut of Esquimaux. 
Only one opening—a small door. 
II. As Civilization Developed: A tendency to appro- 
priate architectural forms or structure without re- 
gard to fitness for climatic or social needs. 
Why we find every style in the United States. 
“Sky-scraper”? an American invention. 
III. Three Great Principles: Stability, Utility, Beauty. 
The underlying principle of all: Perfect adaptation 
to limitations and environment. 
Our “Colonial School” an example of the frank

acceptance of local limitation. No architects — 
the result of the interested cooperation of those 
who were to use the buildings with those who 
were to construct them. Most careful attention 
given to proportions and proper spacings — de- 
sign of doors, windows, facades.

“All good architecture is the sincere response of the 
architect to the conditions which circumscribe his work, 
the uses to which his building is to be put and the cli- 
matic and social conditions of his entourage.” 
Topics suggested for further consideration: 
1. Modern School Buildings — the Educational Influ- 
ence of Environment. 
“In the past twenty-five years the average 
school building has become an object of some beauty 
and interest in marked contrast to the earlier build- 
ings. This greater attention now paid to appear- 
ances cannot fail to react favorably upon the chil- 
dren, giving them a more vital interest in the appli- 
cation of general art principles.’—-REPORT OF 
ComMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 1915. 
2. Community Use of Public Buildings. 
“The study of the civic center is the study of the 
spontaneous life of communities. . . . . What 
I see in the movement is a recovery of the con- 
structive and creative genius of the American people. 
And it seems to me that the school- 
eae dotted here, there, everywhere, over the 
great expanse of this nation will some day prove to 
be the roots of that great tree of liberty which shall 
spread for the sustenance and protection of all man- 
kind.” — Wooprow WILson. 
3- Colonial Architecture of New England. 
4. Architecture of the West. 
5. The Old South in American Architecture.

6. Building for the People or the Influence of Dem- 
ocratic Ideals. 
7. The Fireplace—the Heart of the Home. 
8. Stairways—Their Charm of Line and Element 
of Mystery. 
9. Doorways — Beautiful and Historic. 
10. Modern Architecture for Country Life. 
“T have thought that a good test of civilization, 
perhaps one of the best, is country life.” —JoHN 
BURROUGHS. 
11. Consider the axiom: ‘‘ We may decorate construc: 
tion but never construct decoration,” in its rela- 
tion to the study of architecture. 
“©The world is still deceived with ornament,’ la- 
mented Shakespeare, and for many years this has 
been widely true. But the deception is one that is 
being gradually and steadily discarded, especially in 
the building of our homes. We are no longer sat- 
isfied with the kind of architectural frills that can be 
‘nailed on.’ Ornate designs and gilded imitations 
are ceasing to attract us.”

HOUSE DECORATION 
T have always felt that the best security for civiliza- 
tion is the dwelling, and that upon properly appointed 
and becoming dwellings depends more than anything 
else the improvement of mankind.— DISRAELI. 
The cultivation of good taste and judgment in the 
matter of house furnishing is one of the most impor- 
tant aims of art education today. The far-reaching 
psychological effect of a restful, yet cheerful, environ- 
ment is being recognized more and more fully. 
Art principles become more lucid in the study of 
their application to everyday problems. ‘Good pro- 
portion,” “beauty of line,” “satisfactory tone rela- 
tionship,” “color harmony,” are things that may be 
brought to mean more to the student than vague terms. 
But it is by systematic study that this is so; by exercises 
designed gradually to train the student in the knowl- 
edge of these things. 
In taking up this outline we are presupposing that 
simple exercises suggested under the first chapter on 
art principles have been given. It is important that 
such things as were learned about spacing, Dark-and- 
Light, and color harmony, should be constantly kept in 
mind when judging textile designs, when studying the 
proportions of a piece of furniture, and when consid-

TEXTILES 
The more I work in the weaving of tapestries and 
fabrics, in the designing of hangings, in the combina- 
tion of colors, in an appreciation of the beauty of the 
fabrics made luminous with light streaming through 
them, or rich and opaque against solid backgrounds, 
the more I appreciate the fact that we have not com- 
menced to apprehend all that may be done with color, 
texture, and line, that the days are not long enough for 
the development of new beauty for the furnishing of 
our homes. — ALBERT HERTER.

“The historic point of view has its own very real

AMERICAN FURNITURE 
“The difference between period furniture and fur- 
niture based entirely upon good craftsmanship is the 
difference between the need of the people and the 
whim of the aristocracy. 
“American furniture should embody the same prin- 
ciples that made the slender French, painted Russian, 
and carved English work such perfect creations of © 
their kind, namely fitness and an expression of the 
needs and ideals of the people who made it.
-P-A-G-E-78
64 Better Citizenship   
“American furniture should never be flamboyant, 
nor an imitation of any. period no matter how excel- 
lent it may appear; it should be honestly constructed 
and designed with fine thought for grace and beauty. 
“Contact with strength and sturdiness is good for 
a nation, whether that strength is in character, in archi- 
tecture, or in furniture.” — Gustav STICKLEY. 
“T feel that the time has come when absolute imi- 
tation of any period in architecture, furniture, or dec- 
oration is not greatly valued except for educational 
purposes. We are becoming more and more a devel- 
oped personality as a nation, we are losing our provin- 
ciality, we are ceasing to be fearful of our own ex- 
pression; in other words, the American has developed 
an outline.” — ALBert Herter. :   “Tt is pleasant indeed to look back upon a fine and 
distinguished period of architecture and of house fur- 
nishing, but it is pleasanter, I think, to look back upon 
it than to live in it. To be sure it is better to have 
periods of beauty than periods of ugliness, but how 
much more interesting, how much more generous, the 
nation’s feeling that demands intelligence and culture 
for all the people in order that all the people shail 
create about them beautiful surroundings. This is in 
reality the true democratic ideal.”

found a new decorative period —that of the twentieth 
century American!” —Hazet H. ADLER,

WOODWORK AND FLOORS 
Feed the oak with oil and polish it with wax.— OLD 
ENGLisH Maxim. 
“Tn finishing woodwork, we believe—and Amer- 
ican architects, decorators, and homemakers are com- 
ing to share our opinion—that stains rather than var- 
nishes are preferable, soft mellow tones of brown, 
green, and gray that protect the surface and deepen 
the color of the wood without obscuring its natural 
beauty of grain and texture.”” — GusTAv STICKLEY. 
“To the Japanese, wood, like anything that pos- 
sesses beauty, is almost sacred, and he handles it with 
a fineness of feeling that at best we reveal when we 
are dealing with precious marbles.” — RALPH CRAM. 
The peasants of Europe use paint most successfully 
but not to cover up the grain of the wood. “ Pine is 
the wood employed, and it is first given a coat of paint 
— usually blue—which is wiped off before it dries. 
The paint sinks into the pores of the wood, empha- 
sizing the grain and giving a wonderful satin sheen 
to the surface.”

a. Should not be obtrusive in Line. That is the 
woodwork should follow the construction lines of the 
room—should be simple and not ornate. Dignity © 
and beauty are to be obtained by well-proportioned 
spacing of walls and windows. Often the decorative 
use of structural woodwork and trim, together with 
division of walls into beautiful spaces, leaves very lit- 
tle to be desired in the way of “ ornament.” 
b. Should not be obtrusive in Tone. That is the 
value of the woodwork should not be too dark or too 
light for walls. Floors, particularly, should not be 
too light in value. Woodwork that is “ out of value” 
jumps, will not “‘ stay put.” 
c. Should not be obtrusive in Color. ‘It naturally 
seems best, in coloring wood, to give to it by art such 
colors, on the whole, as. might have been given by 
nature. There are many rich browns, for instance, 
that resemble the colors in the bark of a tree; mellow, 
greenish stains suggest the moss-grown trunk and col- 
ors of the foliage; while the soft shades of brownish 
gray recall the hues produced by weathering.” — Gus- 
TAV STICKLEY. 
d. Woods appropriate for ditferent rooms: 
Living-room, Library, Dining-room, Halls, etc.: 
Woods of pronounced grain, rough texture, as oak, 
ash, elm, chestnut, or cypress. 
Parlors, Bedrooms: 
Woods of smoother texture, less defined grain, as 
poplar, maple, birch, our native gum woods, etc.

WALLS AND CEILINGS 
The first impression of a room depends upon its 
walls. 
As has been said, the walls and ceiling of a room 
should be considered as part of the background or 
setting for the furnishings. They may be, according 
to the style or character of the house, of rough plas- 
ter, papered, tinted, painted, calcimined, paneled with 
wood, burlap, and other textiles, or with beaver-board, 
compo-board, and the like.

OUTLINE FOR STUDY 
Assignment: Clippings, illustrations for notebooks. 
Line: The division of the wall spaces by placement 
of windows, doors, molding, paneling, etc., is a mat- 
ter of line composition and should be considered most 
carefully. A room whose ceiling is too high may be 
improved by lowering molding (principle of opposi- 
tion), one that is too low by placing molding at ceiling. 
Remember that a rectangular space that is equal to two 
squares is a commonplace proportion. Feeling and 
judgment are to be consulted in choosing a beautiful 
proportion. 
Value: As to value, or Dark-and-Light, the lighter 
the value of the ceiling the higher it will appear, and 
the size of a room will appear larger or smaller ac- 
cording to the value of its walls and ceiling. Figured 
paper has the effect of bringing the walls closer to- 
gether, plain paper of making them recede. Avoid the 
spotty appearance of too great a contrast in Dark-and- 
Light in figured wall paper. 
Color: Value and color are so intimately associated 
that while value may be considered without color, color 
may not be considered apart from its value. Chroma, 
or intensity, is another attribute of color that must be 
reckoned with. The following general rules relating 
to color schemes for rooms is offered for discussion: 
For formal room—cool hues, light value. 
For informal room — warm hues. 
Living-room — middle or low chroma, any hue, 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
    
Through Art Training 71 
Sleeping-room —light value, low chroma, not more 
than two hues. 
Kitchen—light value, strong chroma, cool hue. 
These are very general rules. The situation of a 
room, whether it be a north room or a south room, 
its lighting, etc., all have direct influence upon the hue, 
value, and intensity of color used. Color will be 
treated more specifically under ‘General Arrange- 
ment.”

GENERAL ARRANGEMENT 
Have nothing in your houses that you do not know 
to be useful or believe to be beautiful. — WILLIAM 
Morris. 
Perhaps if we begin with Morris’ injunction, the task 
of assembling and of arranging our furniture will, in- 
deed, no longer be a task, but a joy and privilege. 
“Tn every homemaker is the artist’s power to vis- 
ualize a perfectly appointed home and the humble 
workman’s willingness to patiently work out the de- 
tails that would be troublesome enough without love 
of the work. To select the proper furniture, draperies, 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
72 Better Citizenship 
rugs, and all the manifold little things that go to make 
up a livable, lovable home involves knowledge of ma- 
terial gained only by study and experience, a sense of 
fitness, and an inner feeling for beauty.” 
OUTLINE FOR STUDY 
Assignment of papers. 
1. The Place of Period Decoration in American 
Homes 
“We. have had period decorations and all their 
forms of variation given us till we have finally and 
with determination demanded something distinctly ex- 
pressive of our own period, which is a fitting setting 
and background for our own modern, alive selves.” 
— ASCHERMANN. 
oe beautiful things from many ages can 
be gathered together by proper selection with artistic 
result. Rooms should not be historical collections of 
period furniture, for then they would be too formal, 
too much like a showroom instead of an inviting place 
to live. 
“Certain pieces of furniture of widely different 
types are companionable as are some people of dia- 
metrically different characters. ‘Why not have our 
rooms filled with furniture of different types as we 
enjoy having friends of different interests? 
“Tf we can have but one living-room, why should 
we have only one type of thought in it, such as is rep- 
resented by a set of furniture? Variety of form and
-P-A-G-E-87
  Through Art Training 73 
type, of color and size, makes for far greater grace, 
informality, and sense of comfort.” 
_ Period furniture is more suitable for formal pub- 
lic places, such as clubhouses, hotel apartments, etc. 
While such places, since they are community homes, 
should be dignified, beautiful, and appealing, no per- 
sonality is expected nor desired; an intimate touch here, 
contrary to what is looked for in the real home, is out 
of place. 
2. Selection of Furnishings 
By what net of selection or rearrangement of objects 
is beauty caught? 
a. Many things to be considered: 
Furnishings must be in keeping with house (suita- 
bility) ; 
Must be of good design and finish (art qualities) ; 
Must be of honest craftsmanship (sincerity) ; 
_ Must be of lasting worth, not a fad of the hour 
(simplicity) . 
Consider the three S’s —Sincerity, Suitability, Sim- 
plicity. 
b. Selection by Elimination 
“In place of the restless over-furnished, over-dec- 
orated rooms that were in vogue a few decades ago, 
our homes are growing more gracious with the beauty 
of simplicity. Elimination, blowing like a refreshing 
breeze through open doors and windows is sweeping 
away that which was needless or ugly, leaving the use- 
ful, the comfortable, and the beautiful behind.” 
“Tn every phase of life in America we are coming 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  74 Retter Citizenship 
  to recognize the importance of elimination, and espe- 
cially is this true in the furnishing and decoration of 
our homes in what may be known as the American 
style.” 
“Thus we see that in order to achieve real distinc- 
tion and beauty in American home furnishings we must 
approach the undertaking from the standpoint of elim- 
ination, or judicious selection of objects, textures, and 
color harmonies.” 
“T have never been in any rich man’s house which 
would not have looked the better for having a bon- 
fire made outside of it of nine-tenths of all that it 
held.” — WiLi1AM Morris. 
c. Japanese Influence 
“The Japanese show their appreciation of a perfect 
article in a manner that has much to recommend it. 
They place but a single beautiful object in the’ niche 
reserved for it. The objects are changed to show 
honor to a guest, upon holidays, with the changes of 
seasons, or for any other good reason that occurs to 
the household. 
“Our tendency is to crowd our rooms with as many 
costly things as we can get into them, while theirs is 
to have as few as possible in evidence at one time. 
They feel that the full beauty of an object can only be 
gained by giving it a setting that in no way distracts 
attention from it.” (Principle of subordination.) 
d. Selection by Assimilation 
“There is a limit to our capacity for appropriating 
and assimilating material things. Mere ownership 
is not possession. The only houses which have real
-P-A-G-E-89
  Through Art Training 75   
meaning and beauty are the ones into which the owner 
has toilsomely, yet lovingly, worked a part of him- 
self.” 
Often owners of mansions, occupied only a few 
months ‘“‘in the season,” “‘are haunted by the desire 
to own more things than their souls can grasp and 
their personalities can vitalize.” 
“We should give more study to the matter of 
furnishing our homes, buying a few things at a time, 
as we find articles that we like, and thus gradually 
build up our home as we build up our education.” 
e. Expression of Personality in Selection 
“More and more we are doing our own thinking and 
planning and selecting, and expressing our own indi- 
viduality in an environment that we ourselves help to 
create.” 
3. Arrangement of Furnishings 
It is well to remember that in the beginning of this 
study we agreed that art was arrangement — arrange- 
ment of Line, of Tone, of Color, and arranged accord- 
ing to certain principles of balance, symmetry or order, 
of opposition, transition, repetition, and of subordina- 
tion. (See Composition, by A. W. Dow.) 
In arranging or placing furnishings in a room, we 
are dealing with the three elements of art— Line, 
Tone, and Color, and we must dispose of them accord- 
ing to certain laws or principles if we expect a harmo- 
nious whole. 
Line. The structural lines of the room must be 
strengthened, not weakened, by the placement of fur-
-P-A-G-E-90
76 Better Citizenship 
niture and the hangings of draperies, etc. The vertical 
line, we must remember, is a line of dignity, the horizon- 
tal line, one of rest. For grace, and to avoid stiffness 
and formality, the transitional line may be used, but 
the oblique line, used indiscriminately, will cause con- 
fusion and unrest. 
If a room is too long its length may be apparently 
shortened by using the principle of opposition — per- 
haps by the placing of a rug or table. Other ways in 
which this principle may be used, or is used, will occur 
to anyone giving the matter some thought. An in- 
stance of balance or symmetry is not hard to find. It 
may be a so-called ‘‘occult balance” or the simple 
order or balance secured by the placing of two chairs 
on either side the mantelpiece. 
The principle of subordination is apt to seem, to 
the untrained mind, somewhat elusive, but it is a vastly 
important principle—the one that brings about unity, 
cohesion, and simplicity. The Japanese understand 
this principle thoroughly. It is a matter of ‘‘creating 
beauty by the elimination of the superfluous.” 
“Every part of an interior, evety wall space, man- 
telpiece, corner, or grouping of furniture should be a 
beautiful still life, its elements so juxtaposed as to make 
in itself what is called a picture—a paintable thing 
just as it stands, with lights and shades, harmonies or 
contrasts, accented or plain surfaces as in a well-com- 
posed and balanced canvas. It is this studying of the 
problem as an ensemble, this subordination of detail, 
which should be the artist’s work in the creation of any 
room, and it is in this most essential quality that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  Through Art Training — 71 
amateur or the commercial and untrained decorator 
makes the flagrant mistake of assembling objects 
which, however good in themselves, are unrelated.” 
— ALBERT HERTER. 
~ Tone. Under “Walls and Ceilings,’ Tone, or 
value, was discussed. In furnishings as well, this ele- 
ment is to be considered. The principle of opposition 
is used for the sake of contrast and variety, yet a 
spotty appearance must be avoided by keeping in mind 
the principle of subordination. A certain amount of 
balance in value relationship is inevitable in a beauti- 
ful tone harmony—transition used also. 
Color. The principle of opposition (the use of 
complementary colors) overcomes the unpleasant 
monotony of a scheme of one hue or adjacent hues, 
but in order to gain unity the principle of subordination 
must come into play. The repetition, or echo, of a 
hue in a room, by way of textile, pottery, rug, etc., is 
a necessary means of distributing color. Transition 
applied to color harmony is a means by which we may 
soften what might otherwise be too severe a combina- 
tion. 
“The obvious consequence of ill-considered com- 
binations is a subtle irritation, an unrest, which carries 
its inevitable but usually unanalyzed reaction. For 
some reason the ear protests against discord in sound, 
while the eye adjusts itself more easily to disharmony, 
and fails to recognize what is subconsciously a factor 
of unrest and nervous strain. . . . . Wecanbe 
trained to formulate our unconscious sensitiveness and 
to more or less scientifically apply our conscious knowl-
-P-A-G-E-92
  78 Better Citizenship   
edge, so that we can control and improve our color 
surroundings as we try to the noises and smells that we 
find obnoxious.”” — ALBERT HERTER. 
The following are topics that should be considered 
in connection with the study of color in furnishings: 
. The Influence of Peasant Art. 
. The Influence of Leon Bakst. 
The Influence of the Japanese Print. 
. The Influence of the Oriental Rug. 
. Symbolism in Color. 
aoe oO 
Color was first used symbolically in the hieroglyphics 
of Egypt. It played a part in the religious rites of all 
primitive peoples. The colors in an oriental rug are 
symbolic. 
White is always used for purity; 
Black for evil; 
Blue for virtue and truth; 
Yellow for royalty (in China) ; 
Green is regarded as a holy color by the Turks; 
Red is symbolic of blood, fire, excitement. 
f. The Mental Influence of Color: 
Yellow brings cheer and light into a dark room. 
“ Morbid dispositions require this color though they do 
not choose it.” 
Red irritates the nerves — may be used in clubrooms, 
dance halls, etc., ‘‘where gaiety and a certain amount 
of excitement are desirable, but for other interiors it 
should be employed only in occasional detail. Often 
mothers choose red for the nursery because the chil-
-P-A-G-E-93
  
comeing 
dren like it; but the normal child is naturally excitable 
and nervous, and does not need this rousing note.” 
Blue is calm, retiring, refreshing in character —is 
successfully used in warm climates, in summer homes, 
and sunny south rooms. 
Orange, the combination of yellow and red, is sym- 
bolic of light and heat which makes it the hottest color 
possible. Since it is the strongest and most intense of 
colors, it should be used in small areas only. 
Violet, composed of red and blue, suggests heat and 
cold combined—which results in ashes. It is the color 
of shadows; it expresses restrained heat, or mystery 
and gloom, and this is the psychological reason for its 
use in mourning and religious rites. 
Green, the result of mixing yellow and blue, ex- 
presses light and coolness. Generally speaking it is 
the most successful color that can be used in interior 
furnishing, for it eliminates the nerve-exciting red and 
combines rest and cheer—than which nothing can be 
better for a home. 
4. Individuality or Personality in Furnishing 
There may be many ways of solving a problem — 
all equally good, as far as theory goes. There may be 
innumerable ways, all admirable, in which harmony 
may be brought about in house decoration. 
The choice of the way indicates the individuality of 
the decorator. However, we should not expect the 
professional decorator to be able to put himself — 
that is, to make a choice that is expressive of his per- 
sonality — into the decoration of other peoples’ homes, 
   
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 Better Citizenship   
That is asking too much; in fact, the impossible. He 
will follow the rules of the game but the result is apt 
to be an interior that is “‘too perfect, with an unpleas- 
ant air of aloof superiority, an unlovable trait in rooms 
as well as in people.” 
No, we may not shift the responsibility for the dec- 
oration of our homes on to other peoples’ shoulders. 
It is a matter of training and education in which we 
all should participate. It is this sort of education that 
we want in our schools, the sort that shall “help the 
men and women of America to achieve not mere houses 
or mansions, but real homes.” 
sf here in America we have newly awak- 
ened to a realization that all homes should be well 
built, beautiful in architecture, that all these well-built 
homes should possess lovely gardens made fair by the 
hand of the mistress, that the inside of the home should 
express the personality of the woman who lives in it, 
who is the spirit of it. In order to accomplish all these 
delightful things it is necessary that American women. 
should really learn to understand gardening and should 
elect in many instances, more than we can compute, to 
become the decorators of their own houses.”

WILLIAM MORRIS 
“Even if Morris’ writings were but half as beauti- 
ful as they are, he would still have touched eminence 
in his day and generation, for his apparently exhaust- 
less energy, his diversified interests, his untiring occu- 
pation, his command over so many mediums of literary 
expression, his wide scope of handicraft achievements, 
would have left their impress upon the taste and opin- 
ion of his time and country.” 
Any study of the principles of good taste and of art 
applied to daily living would be incomplete without an 
acknowledgment of the influence of William Morris, 
and a consideration of those ideals for which Morris 
lived his life. 
In the books of almost every writer on interior dec- 
oration and kindred subjects, in the writings of almost 
every social reformer, we see his words quoted. It is 
patent that certain of our American craftsmen are fol- 
lowing in his footsteps, and that students and teachers 
of the arts in general find great inspiration in his life. 
“His medievalism was in the spirit more than in the 
letter, and he opened up a vast field for activity in all 
branches of the arts and crafts. In doing this he did 
a noble work, and a work that will continue to de- 
velop through many arts-and-crafts societies. Through 
his connection with art workers and art problems he
-P-A-G-E-97
  Through Art Training 83 
came to his position of a socialist, through art and 
its needs, not through the usual channels of political 
economy and kindred lines.” 
Did not Morris have the same purpose in studying 
medieval life that the Renaissance leaders of thought 
had in studying the lives of the ancients? The Re- 
naissance idea was to “‘study the grammar, in order 
_to learn the language, to get the life, to live the ideals 
of the Athenians.” Was there not something of this 
sort in Morris’ passion for medievalism?

6. Morris and Company. N 
Consider in connection with the study of Morris: 
1. The relation between industry and art. 
“Life without labor is guilt, and industry without 
art is brutality.” 
“To give people pleasure in the things they must 
perforce use, that is the one great office of decoration; 
 
-P-A-G-E-98

to give people pleasure in the things they must perforce 
make, that is the other use of it.” 
2. What should be the spirit of the true craftsman? 
1. “Als ik Kan.” 
“The lyf so short the craft so long to lerne.’’ 
“That thing which I understand by real art is the 
expression by man of his pleasure in labor.” — WIL- 
LIAM Morris. 
“The hand can execute nothing higher than the char- 
acter can inspire.” 
3: What responsibility have we zs individuals in 
helping to cultivate good taste and judgment? 
a. As consumers — purchasers. 
b. As producers—creators, makers, doers. 
Awful is Art because ’tis free. 
The artist trembles o’er his plan 
Where men his Self must see. 
Who made a song or picture, he 
Did it, and not another, God nor man. 
—SipNey LANIER. 
“What does all this art movement mean to Amer- 
ica? It means that William Morris alone descended | 
from the clouds of romanticism to put into practical, 
utilitarian form the charms and value of Beauty. This 
was work enough for one man to have done. We 
must see that he did not live in vain. Let us gird on 
the armor and attack the thousand-headed monster of 
Ugliness that crowds us at every turn. If we cannot 
all of us be William Morrises, let us be his disciples

for better taste, fight ugliness with beauty, and thus 
reap a share of the reward that was so sweet to him.” 
4. Is the understanding then of this whole subject 
a matter of education? And that brings us to the 
question, what is an education? A matter of tabulated 
knowledge, useful information, perhaps. Or shall we 
say rather a matter of right attitudes, a sense of values, 
a matter of seeing things in their true proportions? 
5. What sort of an art education do we want? 
A study of art principles so that there may be true 
appreciation on the part of many. In that sense Mor- 
ris says: “I do not want art for a few any more than 
education for a few or freedom for a few.” He speaks 
also of “‘a new art, a glorious art, made by the people 
and for the people as a happiness to the maker and 
user.”

COSTUME DESIGN 
The study of art principles as applied to dress may 
not begin too early. Even in elementary schools the 
subject is taught most successfully, with the result that 
there is great improvement in the choice and judgment 
displayed by the children in matters of dress. 
In high schools and colleges the study of costume 
design, in all its phases, should receive serious atten- 
tion. Gustav Stickley says: ‘‘I myself have for years 
felt that dress was one of the significant issues of the 
day, that our social and political conditions were ex- 
pressed in it, or hampered by it.” He asks: ‘‘ What 
does the dress of our women as it stands today cost 
us materially and spiritually? Where do we find the 
salvation for this condition? Must our women create 
the reform themselves? Is it a matter of education? 
Can we hope for better things from the present gen- 
eration or must it lie wholly in the training of our chil- 
dren?” 
To answer these questions intelligently requires in- 
terest, thought, and a certain amount of research work 
on the part of the student. The following outline is 
offered: 
I. History of Costume. 
II. The Esthetic Study of the Person. 
III. Dress from the Standpoint of Design.

Early Gauls: 
Painted and tattooed bodies. 
Skins of Animals. Hip aprons. Barbaric jewelry. 
After the Roman Conquest, the tunic, mantle, etc., of 
the conquerors were worn. (Caesar conquered Gaul 
55 B.c.) Later, in the fifth century, after the estab- 
lishment of the French kingdom, a combination of 
Roman, Gallic, and Frankish costume was worn.

French Costume: 
The eighth century the beginning of French dress. 
Women wore two tunics —under one long, straight, 
and narrow; outer one short and full. 
In the eleventh century, silks, cashmeres, etc., were 
introduced by returning crusaders. Buttons appeared 
for the first time. 
The fourteenth century was a period of luxury. This 
century is noted for its eccentricities of dress. Pointed 
shoes, high pointed headdress harmonized with the 
turrets, pointed arches, etc., of Gothic architecture. 
In the fifteenth century, reign of Louis x1, dress was 
more simple. The latter part of the fifteenth century 
French costume was characterized by rich materials, 
bright colors, but greater dignity and grace of line. 
In the sixteenth century, Renaissance, there were 
great changes in dress. Introduction of crinoline, 
hoops and corsets for women; bodice with pointed 
waistline, front panel, and over this a robe which fell 
to the floor in great tubelike folds. Garments for both 
men and women were much slashed. In the reign of 
Henry m1 many men adopted feminine fashions, wear- 
ing enormous ruffs and tight corsets. 
In the reign of Henry tv the hoop skirt became 
barrel shaped and so large that the arms rested upon it. 
Waists were smaller, more pointed, padded, and puffed. 
Sleeves had very large ruffs. The corset had become 
a true instrument of torture; the whole costume a 
ridiculous silhouette. 
Louis x111— hoops and padding discarded, lines be- 
came more graceful.
-P-A-G-E-105
  ee ee 
Louis x1v—again the pointed waistline, very low 
necks, no hoops, but stiff materials with much fullness. 
Introduction of the bustle. Enormous headdresses 
sometimes two feet high. 
Eighteenth century —charming Watteau costumes, 
characterized by grace —influence of Marie Antoinette 
—enormous headdress, hoops, profusion of laces, rib- 
bons, puffings, ‘‘ pannier.” 
During Revolution, at first styles and materials were 
simpler. Later, with the Directoire, Greek and Ro- 
man costumes were copied but in an exaggerated way. 
The men copied English fashions. 
Costumes, at the time of Napoleon, which we now 
call Empire, were revivals of Greek fashions. Dresses 
had short waists, long skirts, low necks and short, puffy 
sleeves. Shawls were used. 
Period 1815-1830, the Restoration — fashions were 
very ugly; bad proportions in everything. 
In 1850—luxury and extravagance. 
In 1854—hoops returned and polonaise was intro- 
duced with triple flounces on skirts. Until 1870 the 
most fantastic costumes for women were worn. After 
that time skirts became smaller, hoops disappeared, and 
lines of gowns were more dignified. Exaggeration and 
vulgarity were no longer prevalent. In 1880 dress 
was more simple. Gloves adopted generally at this 
time. 1880-1900— development of better taste. Bus- 
tles and pads were worn fora time. ‘‘ Leg-o’-mutton” 
sleeves and other idiosyncrasies. Since then there have 
been many changes but the novelties have not lasted 
long. 
 
-P-A-G-E-106

“More intelligence and thought have been given 
in the adaptation of the best of the costumes of the 
past to the needs of today.” 
Regular fashion sheets have been in vogue only since 
the French Revolution. 
OUTLINE FOR STUDY 
(Using as text History of English Costume by D. 
C. Calthrop.) 
As an interesting climax to the study of the history 
of costume, an evening of Tableaux Vivants might be 
given, tracing the evolution of dress, in chronological 
order, from early times down to the present. 
Chap. 1— William 1. 
Chap. 1— William u. 
Chap. 11— Henry 1. 
Chap. 1v—Stephen—and so on through contents 
of book. 
The different chapters may be assigned to different 
students who may report their findings for the benefit 
of others in the class. All should make tracings for 
their notebooks of the important periods. 
“The tendencies of other generations can be studied 
in dress as well as in architecture and language.” 
Il. THE ESTHETIC STUDY OF THE PERSON 
Esthetics —theory of good taste—the science of 
the beautiful in nature and art. 
Dress should be subordinate to the wearer; should
-P-A-G-E-107
  Through Art Training 93   
be persuasive not self-assertive; should emphasize the 
personality of the wearer. 
1. In taking up the study of dress from this stand- 
point there are many things to consider: 
. Care of the person—cleanliness, etc. 
. Arrangement of the hair. 
c. Proper dress—as to outergarments and under- 
garments. 
d. Shoes, gloves, hats. : 
e. Accessories —jewelry, bags, scarfs, parasols, etc. 
oe 
2. Suitability, Sincerity, Simplicity—three watch- 
words. 
“Simplicity is not plainness, nor stupidity, but the 
intelligent omission of the superfluous.” 
Considering these we find selection based upon: 
a. Time of year g. Hygienic laws 
b. Time of day h. Means or wealth 
c. The occasion i. Use of garment— 
d. Style of figure does it answer the pur- 
e. Coloring pose for which it was 
f. Age of wearer designed? 
Any violation of the law of Suitability or Appropri- 
ateness brings the transgressor face to face with Con- 
spicuousness, than which there is no deadlier sin against 
good taste.  
-P-A-G-E-108
  94 Better Citizenship   
Ill. DRESS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF DESIGN 
Decoration is the most powerful and controlling fac- 
tor in the selection of body covering. 
Design or Art in dress is a matter of Line, Tone, and 
Color arrangement. These three elements may be so 
used and manipulated as to conceal or exaggerate 
faults, a sort of art jugglery, or they may be used to 
enhance nature’s most wonderful handiwork. 
OUTLINE FOR STUDY 
Assignment: Clippings from fashion sheets, illus- 
trating each principle under each element, mounted and 
brought in for class criticism. Clippings or tracings 
also for notebooks. 
LINE 
Line in dress design takes into account the silhouette 
of figure, or boundary of space; and also the breaking 
up of the space, as in other designs, by other lines: 
construction lines and lines of trimming or decora- 
tion. Here again we must remember that we may 
“decorate construction, but never construct decora- 
tion.” And again we must remember the significance 
of the various kinds of lines, the vertical, oblique, etc. 
Do we wish to express dignity in our dress? Are we 
willing that our appearance should give the feeling of 
unrest —a subtle annoyance?
-P-A-G-E-109
  
Through Art Training 95 
Consider the following principles in connection with 
Line —when they may be used to advantage and how: 
Opposition —as use of horizontal lines to oppose 
length of tall person. 
Transition —used where too much opposition would 
be severe, as “‘V.” neck instead of sauare neck, long 
transitional lines in drapery, etc. 
Repetition—as motifs in bands of trimming, etc. 
Too many lines of opposition, as many tucks from 
waist to hem of skirt, produce repetition rather than 
opposition and add to apparent height of figure. 
Symmetry, or balance—either obvious or occult as 
the placing of an ornament on the uptilted side of 
hat, etc. 
Subordination — the bringing about of unity in @ cos- 
tume by centering the interest, usually near the face; 
by considering all parts of the costume in relation to 
the whole. 
“The subordinate relation of the costume to the 
wearer and the unity of the whole is a result of the 
study of art principles; for dress design is first of all 
an art vroblem.” 
TONE 
(Make tracings of costumes, changing Dark-and- 
Light schemes. ) 
As in Line, the principles of opposition (contrast), 
of repetition (echo), of transition (gradation), of 
symmetry (balance), of subordination (unity), come 
into play. 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
96 Better Citizenship   
Discuss these and illustrate each principle with find- 
ings from fashion sheets, as Vogue, Vanity Fair, 
Harper’s Bazar, etc. 
COLOR 
Opposition in color means the use of complementary 
hues, and this use must be in subordinate relation as 
explained in the first section under ‘‘ General Art Prin- 
ciples.” The other principles of repetition, transition, 
symmetry, and subordination applied to color arrange- 
ment may be studied and color theory reviewed. 
To illustrate color harmony in dress design by use 
of clippings from fashion sheets may perhaps be diffi- 
cult. A most satisfactory way out of the difficulty is 
to have students bring a number of costumes to class. 
A frank criticism of these on the part of the teacher 
or leader of group and students will bring out many in- 
teresting points. 
In connection with the study of color harmony in 
dress, the coloring of the wearer must be considered; 
and the general becomingness of the gown not only 
from point of color, but also from suitability of line 
and beauty of tone. 
Several types, a blonde, a brunette, a person with 
auburn hair or red hair, might pose before the class in 
costumes of different colors, etc. This practical demon- 
stration can be made of great value if serious thought 
is given to the selection of costumes to be shown, and 
the principles underlying each are brought to the atten- 
tion of the class.

IV. SELECTION OF CLOTHING FROM THE. STAND- 
POINT OF: 
1. Hygiene. 
2. Economic and Sociological Responsibility. 
3. Ethics. 
1. Hygiene of Clothing. 
a. Clothing in relation to body heat. The purpose 
of clothing primarily is to protect the body from cold 
and to maintain a constant body temperature. Heat 
and energy are generated by the body. If heat is dis- 
sipated too quickly by exposure of the surfaces of the 
body, there is waste of energy and danger. In sum- 
mer, clothing should not interfere with the dissipation 
of heat. In winter, proper clothing should prevent un- 
due loss of heat. 
Study of the qualities or properties of different sorts 
of material, wool, cotton, linen, silk, as to which retain 
heat, moisture, etc. 
b. Not only heat of body must be considered but 
also cleanliness. Study of materials with this in mind. 
c. Unrestricted body—a consideration of the evils 
of tight clothing, high-heeled shoes, etc. (Charts may 
be obtained from physicians showing the danger of 
throwing weight forward on ball of foot instead of 
sharing weight with heel.) 
d. Dangers in textiles—from dyes, insanitary con- 
ditions of factory, workshop, or home. 
. e. Relation of fashion to the hygienic clothing of the 
body. Should fashion dictate where laws of hygiene 
are concerned?
-P-A-G-E-112

Consider that: 
Velvet hats and furs are worn. 
Heavy clothing is often worn by men. 
Coat suits of women are often uncom- 
fortable. In summer 
and 
Straw hats are introduced in January. 
Thin clothing that is suitable for indoor 
In winter wear in steam-heated buildings, is 
often worn where conditions are not 
so favorable. 
Origin of these customs among the ultra-fashionable 
—do we have to “copy?” What of our vaunted 
American independence ? 
2. Economic and Sociological Responsibilities. 
“The study of the economics of consumption must 
be, in a large degree, a study of the time and its needs, 
a consideration of the influence of factors large and 
small in the home life, and a realization of the re- 
quirements for woman’s training for service in the 
home, and also in civic and national life.” 
(1) Economic Study of Woman as a Textile Con- 
sumer. (She has ceased to be a producer except in a 
small way in factories.)

“As a class, women neither choose materials wisely, 
nor indicate satisfactorily what shall be produced from 
manufactured goods—hence are not efficient as plan- 
ners or users of wealth for textiles.”

  terial is made upon foreign countries; consequently 
American factories are obliged to specialize on me- 
dium-grade fabrics. Domestic goods, when equal in 
quality, should have preference with American consum- 
ers.” 
Question: Have we the technical equipment (ma- 
chinery, etc.) in America to produce textiles as beau- 
tiful as those we import? (We could have, of course.) 
Have we in America designers of fabrics equal to the 
designers or artists of Europe? (We could have.) 
“What shall it profit a nation that possesses the 
treasures of earth if it cannot refine them to its highest 
needs?” 
(Read articles by M. D. C. Crawford, of the 
American Museum of Natural History, on this sub- 
ject.) 
(2) The Consumers’ Responsibility to the Producer.

of wealth rather than producers, and they owe the 
women workers their intelligent consideration—and 
‘their assistance for further betterment.”

3. Ethical Standpoint. 
“Tt is impossible to state the relation in exact terms, 
but we believe that adequate, attractive, neat clothing 
is a factor in virtue, and that being well dressed gives a 
feeling of satisfaction and self-confidence which often 
enables the wearer to conquer a difficult situation.” 
(1) Obligation to train for the highest service that 
can be given through wise consumption. 
Each woman must decide which, for herself, is the 
best method: Shall she wear ready-made or home- 
made clothing? Buy a few expensive, exclusive styles 
that last; or a greater number, perhaps, of simple and 
inexpensive clothes? 
(2) Obligation to consider: 
a. The objective and subjective influence of dress. 
The matter of modesty. Beauty in clothes. Self-con- 
fidence. 
b. The amount of time that may rightly be given to 
the subject of dress. 
Shall women adopt a uniform business dress? etc.

  ART HISTORY 
“The evolution of art is never complete; to speak 
of perfection in art is a dangerous error, for by impli- 
cation, it condemns artists to an eternal reproduction 
of the same models, to the renunciation of progress. 
The function of men of genius is rather to prepare the 
way for new tendencies by giving adequate and definite 
expression to those of their own times.” 
The history of art, in its beginning, is a story of ap- 
plied art. ‘From the time of the cave-dweller man 
has sought to spell out his soul in line and pattern.” 
Until the time of Leonardo da Vinci the story of art 
is the story of man’s spiritual longing “to decorate 
his person, his weapons, his home and all his belong- 
ings.” 
“Soon after the time of Leonardo da Vinci art ed- 
ucation was classified into Representative (imitative) 
and Decorative, with separate schools for each—a se- 
rious mistake which has resulted in loss of public ap- 
preciation. Painting, which is essentially a rhythmic 
harmony of colored spaces, became sculptural, an imi- 
tation of modeling. Decorations become trivial, a 
lifeless copying of styles. The true relation between 
design and representation was lost.” — A. W. Dow. 
In studying art history the foregoing must be kept 
in mind. Also we must remember that as art students
-P-A-G-E-118
104 Better Citizenship 
we have certain standards by which we may judge of 
the merits of a work of art; for instance, we do not 
have to depend upon the traditional valuation of a pic- 
ture. It may be that, because of its historical or other 
associations, because of its reputation, or because it is 
the work of an old master, its monetary value is very 
great. However, the catalogue of an art gallery should 
not be our sole criterion. If we are at all sure of our 
own judgment, if we have had sufficient training in such 
matters, we may ask this question concerning any so- 
called great work of art: Is it beautiful or forceful in 
line, in line composition or spacing; is it beautiful or 
satisfactory in its tone relationship; is it beautiful or 
striking in its color harmony? 
OUTLINE FOR STUDY

Assignments may take the form of illustrated lec- 
tures, prepared or delivered by individual members of 
class. The stereopticon may be used. Lantern slides 
may be obtained from the Metropolitan Museum or a 
permanent collection may be purchased. Prints should 
be ordered from different publishing houses by the stu- 
dents themselves for their notebooks. This individual 
choice in the matter of illustrative material for note-

Speaking of the French school of the nineteenth cen-

peared; we find it embracing Classicists, Romanticists, 
Realists, Idealists, Impressionists. Thus, everything 
points to the assumption that schools will henceforth no 
longer bear the names of cities or of nations; there 
will no longer be rivalries of countries, but of prin- 
ciples.”

After predicting this internationalism of art, he 
closes his text with these words: 
“Far from believing that the social mission of art 
is at an end, or drawing near that end, I think it will 
play a greater part in the twentieth century than ever. 
And I think—or at least hope—that greater impor- 
tance than ever will be attached to the study of art 
as a branch of culture. This study is one which no 
civilized man, whatever his profession, should ignore 
in these days. It is in this belief that I have prepared 
this brief survey, which I hope may serve the educative 
purposes of art.”

STATUS OF ART EDUCATION IN THE 
UNITED STATES 
Very likely, when speaking of the ‘social mission 
of art,’ Reinach did not have in mind the introduction 
of such subjects as City Planning, Landscape Garden- 
ing, House Decoration, Costume Design, etc., into the 
school curriculum. But his intuitive powers declared, 
no doubt, that in manifold ways the ‘‘ educative pur- 
poses of art” would be served. Considering these 
things, it seems not inappropriate, before closing this 
syllabus, to look into the condition of art education in 
the United States. 
OUTLINE FOR STUDY (QUESTIONNAIRE) 
Assignment of theme, or class discussion. 
1. What is your conception of an art education? 
2. How are you to get the proper training for this 
sort of education? What kind‘of training will give you 
an art education? 
3. Where can you get such training? 
(A thorough study of the art courses offered in pro- 
fessional art schools, in colleges and universities, in 
private schools, and in public schools, should be made. 
Catalogues from the various schools should be sent

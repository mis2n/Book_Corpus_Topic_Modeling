PREFACE 
“The Danish Folk-Dances have the freshness, simplicity and appealing charm 
that is common to all real folk-dances\and folk-songs. The dances contained=in 
this _volume-are-real-folk-dances of Denmark which were collected, described and 
published by the Danish Society for the. Promotion of Folk-Dancing, who have 
done me the honor of authorizing my translation of their work. ee a 
The idea of forming\a Folk-Dance Society in Denmark grew out of a demon- 
stration of Swedish folk-dances given in Copenhagen in 1899 by the Swedish 
Society ‘‘Philochoros,”’ and it was Swedish folk-dancing that was first taken up 
there. 
Later, however, in 1901, the Danish Society for the Promotion of Folk-Dancing 
was organized and the work of collecting the folk-dances, music and costumes of 
Denmark was begun. This was carried on with some financial aid from the gov- 
ernment and resulted in the accumulation of a store of valuable material. 
ems 
The descriptions of the dances were written out and the music arranged by 
committees and later were published by the Society. A collection of costumes 
was made which is particularly valuable, as in many localities the beautiful and 
quaint old folk-costumes have now entirely disappeared. : 
It was to this Society that Rudolf Petersen, the Danish artist, came for assist- 
ance in painting his now famous frieze of National Costume in Gruntvigs House, - 
which Ihave used as the-cover-decoration of this volume.

  FOLK-DANCES OF DENMARK 
INTRODUCTION 
Music 
The repetitions of the music are indicated at the 
beginning of the description of each of the dances.— 
‘The numbers in parentheses that appear in the de- 
scription of the dances refer to those measures of 
the music which correspond with that part of the 
description which immediately follows the paren- 
theses. [This is slightly different from the method 
of describing the dances in the original Danish 
publication, in which the description precedes the 
numbers in parentheses indicating the corresponding 
measures of music.]|—In the music for each dance 
the measures are numbered to correspond with the 
description. 
Formations 
The Front means the end of the room where the 
music is. : 
Starting Position is the position one occupies at 
the beginning of the dance. 
Row Formation. Ladies and men stand opposite 
each other in two rows, ladies to the left, men to 
the right, as seen from the front, the first couple 
standing at the end nearest the front. 
Reversed Row Formation is the same as row for- 
mation, except that the ladies are on the right and 
the men on the left, as seen from the front. 
Quadrille is a set of four couples, the first couple 
standing with back toward the music, the second 
couple facing them, and the third and fourth couples 
to the right and left respectively as seen from the 
first couple’s position. 
Double Quadrille consists of eight couples, two 
couples on each side of the square. We speak here 
of first, second, third and fourth sides instead of 
25614 xi couples. The positions of the sides correspond to 
those of the couples in the quadrille. 
Hand Positions and Ways of Holding Partner 
When nothing else is specified the position of the 
hand is free. 
In Row Formation both hands are free. 
In Quadrille and Double Quadrille the man 
holds the lady’s left hand with his right and the 
lady’s right hand is free. 
Ordinary Position. The man puts his right arm 
around the lady’s waist and holds her right hand in 
his left, the lady placing her left hand on the man’s 
right shoulder. 
One Hand Grasp. Each of the two dancers 
grasps with the right hand the other’s right, or with 
the left hand the other’s left. 
Two Hand Grasp. The two dancers face each 
other and, with arms held straight, join both hands, 
the right hand with partner’s left and the left hand 
with partner’s right. 
Arm Hook. Facing in opposite directions, the 
two dancers hook right arms with the elbows very 
much bent (Right Arm Hook) or hook left arms 
(Left Arm Hook). 
Back Grasp (or Three Hand Grasp). Each of 
the two dancers turns the right side toward the 
other, and each puts the left arm behind the back. 
The lady takes hold of the man’s left hand with her 
right, and the man puts his right arm under the 
lady’s right and takes hold of her left hand. 
Cross Grasp. Standing either face to face or side 
by side (“Front Cross Grasp” or “Side Cross 
Grasp”’), partners join both hands, right with right 
and left with left.
-P-A-G-E-14
  INTRODUCTION 
Back Cross Grasp. Partners stand side by side 
and, with their hands behind them, each with the 
right hand grasps the other’s right hand and with 
the left grasps the other’s left. 
  
    
    
Waist Grasp. The In couples (or in a circle). 
men hold the ladies around the waist and the ladies 
put their hands on the men’s shoulders. 
Shoulder Grasp. The dancers place their hands 
on each others’ shoulders. 
Steps 
Walking, Running, Polka, Hopsa, Waltz and 
Mazurka steps scarcely need to be described. 
Hop Step is danced with a hop, first on one foot 
and then on the other, as in stepping. In some 
dances this may be a long or a short hop forward. 
Sometimes, especially in dancing around in place, 
the step is taken backward (“Other Night’s Steps”). 
In some dances there will be added a lifting of the 
heel, as for instance in the “Jew Dance”; but 
always in the hop step the feet constantly move 
past each other as in ordinary walking. 
Two Step. This is done by turning quickly 
around on the left foot, a half-turn, at the same 
time swinging the right leg around in a circle (the 
feet some distance apart like the legs of an open 
compass), then putting down the right foot and 
turning around on it; at the same time swinging the 
left foot around in a circle, and so on:

  Reel Step. The right foot is put down on the 
floor directly behind the left, and at the same time 
25614 the left is raised. Make a little hop forward on the 
right foot, at the same time bringing the left around 
in a little circle behind the right. Put down the 
left foot close behind the right and at the same time 
raise the right foot. Make a little hop forward on 
the left foot, and so on. The step is danced on 
the same spot and as high on the toes as possible. 
— Quick time:

French Reel Step is like the Reel Step, except 
that the free foot describes a /arge circle forward, 
outward and backward and is placed beside the 
other:

Side Run. One foot is moved one step to the 
side, the other foot is brought up to it; the first 
foot is moved again one step in the same direction 
as before, and the other is brought up to it; and so 
on. 
Buzz Step. 
a couple swings around in place, and sometimes in 
“Mills” and “Circles.”” When danced by a couple, 
the dancers put their right feet together, so that the 
outside edge of one touches the outside edge of the 
other (in “Mills” and “Circles” the right foot is 
placed toward the centre), and then run around with 
the left foot, the right foot moving only a little for 
each step taken by the left foot. This step is sometimes used when

Balancé. The right foot is moved a little to the 
right side, the left foot is placed a little in front of 
the right, the right foot is moved a little forward 
close behind the left. The left foot is moved to. 
the left side, the right in front, the left brought up 
close behind the right; and so on. 
Chassé. The left (or right) foot is moved one 
step, the right (or left) foot is brought up to it, the 
left (or right) foot is moved again one step in the 
same direction as before. 
Spring Away Step is usually danced to the left 
(“with the sun”) with, for instance, two hand grasp.

-P-A-G-E-15
  
INTRODUCTION 
In dancing around on one spot put down the left 
foot, then place the right foot straight in front of 
the left; move the left foot again a little step to the 
left and then place the right foot straight behind the 
left. The step is continued in this manner with 
the right foot placed alternately in front of and be- 
hind the left foot:

ae ee ee TT NaN aN o o os @ 
DP arsleses etc. 
    
In dancing around the room the steps are a little 
different. After the right foot has been placed in 
front of the left, the left foot is moved a longer or 
shorter step to the side with a jump, after which the 
right is placed behind it; and so on. 
Tyrolian Step. The step used in the beginning 
of the common Tyrolian Waltz. [Editor’s Note. 
~The Tyrolian Waltz referred to is as follows: 
Partners stand side by side with inside hands joined. 
(A) Beginning with the outside foot they make four 
balancés, during two measures of music, swinging 
the joined hands forward and back twice. (This 
is the “Tyrolian Step.”) (B) Then in ordinary 
position they waltz together during two more 
measures ; and so on. | ; 
[Tyrolian Hopsa. The same as Tyrolian Waltz, 
except that in dancing around after the four balancés 
Hopsa is danced instead of ordinary waltz. Ed.] 
Tinker’s Step. Put down the right foot in front 
of the left, step backward on the left foot and draw 
the right foot after it, then swing the left foot slowly 
around ina circle and put it down in front of the 
right. Step backward on the right foot and draw 
the left foot after it, then swing the right foot 
around in a circle and put it down in front of the 
left; and so on. i

Trip Step. The man, with an appel, places his 
left foot a little to the left and then without replac- 
ing it makes a second long step with it still further 
to the left. After this he brings the right foot up 
to the left foot and rises a little on the toe. Now, 
with an appel on the right foot, the same step is 
repeated to the right. The lady dances it in the 
same manner, except that she begins with the right 
foot. 
25614 Miscellaneous Terms 
With the Sun means in the same direction as the 
hands of a clock. (For instance, in the case of a 
circle formation the dancers would move from right 
to left around the circle. In the case of an indi- 
vidual dancer the movement would be a right about 
turn.) 
Against the Sun means the reverse of the above. 
Dancing Around may be done either “with the 
sun” or “against the sun,” in place, around the 
room, or around in the set. If not otherwise 
specified, it is done moving around the room 
“against the sun” and turning about “with the sun.” 
Reverse. Turning against the sun in round 
dancing is called “around wrong,” or Reverse. 
Pretty Side Out means when the dancers are in 
circle formation facing outward with backs turned 
toward the centre of the circle. 
Strange Lady is the lady at the left of a man as 
they stand in circle or quadrille formation. 
Strange Man is the man at the right of a lady as 
they stand in circle or quadrille formation. 
Figures 
Circle. Unless otherwise specified, this is formed 
by dancers joining hands in a ring. 
Big Circle is a circle in which all the dancers take 
part. 
  
  One Hand Mill is made by the dancers in a set 
joining right hands with each other across the centre, 
keeping arms straight and dancing around with the 
sun (or joining left hands and dancing around 
against the sun). 
xiii  
-P-A-G-E-16
  INTRODUCTION 
Two Hand Mill is made by four dancers facing 
inward toward the centre of the square and each 
  
  
    
joining both hands (right with left and left with 
right) across the centre with their opposite. In 
25614 joining hands thus across the centre the arms are 
interlaced. In mills and circles which are danced, 
first to the left and then to the right, the change 
of direction is made with an appel. 
Arch is formed by two dancers joining both 
hands and raising them so that the arms form an 
arch under which the other dancers pass. 
Chain is done by couples in a circle. If not 
otherwise specified, each man takes first his own 
lady’s right hand with his right, then the next lady’s 
left hand with his left, and so on. The men dance 
around the circle against the sun and the ladies with 
the sun. Other kinds of chain are described in 
the dances in which they occur. 
Turns during a dance in a circle or quadrille are 
made facing inward. 
If the dancers do not wish to go through all the 
figures of a dance, they agree beforehand on the 
figures they will dance.

In this way they went from farm to farm and 
were entertained. 
The dance may also be danced toward the oppo- 
site side.

  SONDERHO DANCE 
(Island of Fang) 
Music | 1-8 | 9-16 |. 
Danced in couples. 
A. (1-8) Man and lady go slowly arm in arm 
or hand in hand around the room. 
[In olden times the lady used to step in front of 
the man over to his left side, and then behind him 
back to her place during the last two measures 
(7-8).] B. The man takes the lady’s right hand in his 
left, which he holds on his hip; he places his right 
hand high on the lady’s back while she places her 
left hand on his right shoulder-blade. With this 
grasp they dance, turning around right with the fol- 
lowing “Sonderho Step”: The man puts the left 
foot one step straight forward, swings the free right 
foot ina circle and puts it down a little way behind. 
At the same time he turns around on both feet, 
lifting the heels and then putting them down. 
After this he places the right foot a bit to the side. 
Meanwhile the lady has moved the right foot a 
little forward, moved the left foot up to it, and 
again moved the right foot forward. After this 
little chassé step a long step or jump is taken on 
the left foot. Sometimes after the jump the tip of 
the right toe acts as a light support, which is then 
placed lightly on the floor beside the left foot. To 
25614 the first four measures of the music the steps are as 
follows : 
S NNANANAN Jett eal Man {1 r i ies 1 r 
(turn) etc; 
Lady |r 1 r(jump)} 1 rl fr ] ioe 
Though the music is in 2 time, three quarter-notes 
will be used to execute the step. In the eight meas- 
ures (9-16) five Sonderho steps will be danced. 
During these steps the couple progress only a 
short distance (some few feet) around the room 
against the sun, but at the same time on each Son- 
derho step they make a complete about turn, with 
the sun. The movement should be continuous 
and smooth and without any sudden change in 
speed. The lady’s jumps are smaller or larger ac- 
cording to the way the music is played. During 
the turn the man should swing the lady around 
vigorously but smoothly and, if necessary, lift her 
in the jump. 
[The lady’s step is practically the same as in the 
Polonaise (“Jydsk Paa Naesen’’), while the man’s 
is very much like the step of the Swedish “Hambo 
Polska,” except that the time is different. ]

dances back again in and out between the blocks in 
a curved track in the other direction. The middle 
man follows close behind. The last man must

STICK DANCE 
It seems that this dance was generally used as a 
kind of competition between farmhands to show 
who was able to stand it longest. To the tune 
“The Ever-Happy Coppersmith” they used to 
dance a dance in Br¢gnderslev which was called by 
the name of the tune. 
During the first part of the music the farmhands 
joined hands in couples and danced with polka steps 
around the room with great speed. Then they re- 
leased each other and danced opposite each other 
with hop steps, clapping their hands (1) under the 
right leg, (2) above the head, (3) under the left leg, 
(4) above the head, (5) again under the right leg, 
and so on. The legs were swung high when the 
hands were clapped under them. 
ued to the end of the music and then the dance was 
begun anew. In Salling a stick dance was known 
which was danced to the tune of “The Time I 
Went Away.” It seems that here each man danced 
by himself. Each held a stick in either hand and 
danced backward with hop steps, at the same time 
beating his sticks together thus: — (rz) in front of 
him, (2) under the left leg, (3) in front of him, (4) This was contin- under the right leg, (5) in front of him, (6) behind 
his back with the ends pointing toward the floor, 
(7) in front of him and (8) at last he struck both 
sticks against the ceiling. 
The “Stick Dance” published here is from Him- 
merland, Jutland, but it is not know what the dance 
was like there. 
At Lonstrup it was danced in the following man- 
ner to a little melody in 2 time: 
Music |: 1-8 :|: 9-16 :| 
(1-8) The two men first took each other by the 
hands (or around the waist) and danced hopsa or 
two-step. 
(9-16) After which they clapped their hands as 
described above. 
(1-8) Then they danced around again together, 
(9-16) and then with a stick in each hand they 
danced in the same way as in the Stick Dance from 
Salling. It is evident that the dance was a test of 
endurance, for we are told that when one man had 
to stop the other kept it up for a while longer and 
continued swinging the sticks alone.

  CATCH DANCE 
(Vicinity of Skanderborg, Jutland) 
Music |: 1-4 :|: 5-8 :| 
Starting Position. Reversed row formation. 
Steps. Side Run, Chassé. 
A. (1-4) With two hand grasp, first couple 
dance down between the rows with side running 
step (or four chassés). 
(1-4) They release hands, and with same steps 
dance back, behind own row, to place. 
B. (5-8) The lady slips away from the man, 
who has to catch her, both dancing chassé steps 
25614 13 (the music being repeated over and over until the 
lady is caught). The first couple then place them- 
selves at the end of the row. 
After this the second couple start from the be- 
ginning and dance in the same manner. 
When the whole row has been through it, and 
the first couple again stand first, the whole dance is 
repeated, but this time the ladies have to catch the 
men.

SEVEN JUMPS 
(Jutland) 
This Jutland folk-dance is usually done by two 
men, who swing each other around in place until 
the end of the music, on the last note of which they 
both stamp with the right foot. Now they swing 
around again, and then (the last two notes of the 
music being repeated) stamp first with the right feet 
as before, then with the left, and stand still on the 
last note; then swing again. It is continued thus: 
After each swing around, the last two notes are re- 
peated one time more than the last, and each time a 
new movement is added, namely : 
After the third swing around touch the right 
knee on the floor. 
After the fourth, the left knee on the floor. 
After the fifth, the right elbow on the floor. 
After the sixth, the left elbow on the floor. 
After the seventh, swing around, when the last 
two notes are repeated seven times; these 
repeated last notes are accompanied by 
. A stamp on the right foot. 
. A stamp on the left foot. 
. Right knee on the floor. 4. Left knee on the floor. 
5. Right elbow on the floor. 
6. Left elbow on the floor. 
7. Forehead on the floor. 
Now the dance is continued,’ and at every repe- 
tition the last notes and their accompanying move- 
ment are omitted in the reverse order of that in 
which they were added, so that the thirteenth swing 
around ends with a stamp of the right foot. 
Berggreen, from whom the above description is 
taken (see A. P. Berggreen’s “ Danish Folk-Songs 
and Melodies,” page 377), mentions that he has 
seen a description of this from Kullen (Sweden), 
and says that it is found not only in Denmark but 
in Sweden, Switzerland and France, as well. 
In some parts of Denmark it is danced by one 
man and one girl (around Hobro), and in other 
places (around Horsens) by several couples together, 
who join hands in a circle. In the Od District it is 
occasionally varied by one man’s turning a somer- 
sault over the back of the other fellow, instead of 
touching his forehead to the floor.

facing a third couple, with a distance of three steps 
between couples. Seen from the front, first couple 
to the left, second couple opposite them and third 
couple behind second couple. 
Step. Running Step. 
All three couples begin running at the same time. 
First couple “cross,” the lady running across in 
front of man to the left and the man to the right, 
passing outside the second couple and on to the 
third. At the same time, the second couple, hand 
in hand, run through, down to the first couple’s 
place and face about without letting go of each 
other. 
Meanwhile the first couple cross with third cou- 
25614 71 ple, passing outside them, the lady this time running 
to the right and the man to the left. They take 
the third couple’s place and face in the same direc- 
tion as the third couple did. This brings them so 
that the second couple occupy the first couple’s 
place, first couple the third’s place, while the third 
couple run over to the second couple’s place. 
Without pausing, the second couple now cross out- 
side the third and first couples, who run, hand in 
hand, down toward first couple’s place. In this way

A. (1-4) First man and his right lady turn fac- 
ing each other, and with two hand grasp dance four 
Tinker’s Steps in place. 
(5-8) Then they dance around in place with 
«The Other Night’s Step,” the man holding the 
lady with waist grasp and she putting her hands on 
his shoulders. 
(1-8) The first man now turns to his left lady 
and dances with her in the same manner. 
B. (9-10) First and second threes, with an ap- 
pel, advance toward each other three steps and give 
a little bow and 
(11-12) retire again to place. 
(13-16) First man lifts both arms and his right 
lady turns twice around to the left in place, under 
his arm with Hop Steps, at the same time still 
holding his hand. (9-16) Repeat as before, only this time the left 
lady turns around to the right under the man’s arm. 
C. (17-20) First and second threes form a circle, 
with arm grasp, and dance around with hop steps to 
the left. 
(21-24) The same to the right. 
(17-24) Each three now forms a circle of its own

face about to the front and stand still during one : 
time. The threes moving away from the front, 
dance as described for the first three, while those 
moving up toward the front dance as described for 
the second three. When many threes take part in 
the dance, the fifth, ninth (and so on) threes may 
stand with backs toward the front, and begin at the 
same time as the first three. They thus remain as 
first three in relation to the three following threes.

FOREWORD 
To the Readers of ROADS TO CHILDHOOD: 
HIS is a new book. You will find 
new experiences of life in it as well 
as new books, and you will quickly dis- 
cover that the book you already know has 
yielded nothing to this one. 
“New Roads to Childhood” contains 
the reviews of children’s books which 
have appeared in The Bookman from 
November 1920 (when “Roads to Child- 
hood” was published) to November 1923. 
The chapter called “Making a Library” 
was written at the request of William 
Fayal Clarke, Editor of St. Nécholas, in 
1919. It is here presented with acknowl- 
edgment to the Century Company, as a 
small tribute to the half-century anni- 
versary of the founding of St. Nicholas in 
November 1873. But it is your many 
kind words about the title chapter of 
vii
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii FOREWORD 
“Roads to Childhood” and Eugene F. 
Saxton’s genuine interest in the children 
of other countries which have led me to 
share the more intimate experiences of this 
book. 
Five years ago I wrote my first review 
for The Bookman at Mr. Saxton’s request, 
and the sense of freedom and assurance of 
loyal support then accorded me has grown 
into a continuing relationship of happy 
and suggestive association. And so it is 
to you and to Mr. Saxton peculiarly that 
the chapters called “The Romance of the 
Streets” and “The Children of France” 
belong. 
Without the wealth of encouragement 
expressed in your many kind letters the 
writing of these chapters would have been 
impossible. It was because you seemed to 
be listening that I could go on writing 
them. 
Thad intended to include in this book a 
chapter called Books of Information, but 
it remains unwritten for the simple rea- 
son that'while I regard the subject as im- 
portant, I could not at this time give it
-P-A-G-E-9
FOREWORD ix 
the selective and illuminating treatment it 
needs. The same reason holds good in 
relation to several other subjects which I 
am holding in solution for that leisure 
which lies always just ahead. 
In writing of children’s books no less 
than in personal introduction of them to 
readers, I feel it more important to rouse 
the spirit of curiosity, to send the reader 
on a voyage of exploration and discovery 
~—to make books come alive—than it is to 
outline the subject or present the static 
grouping by age and grade which leads, in 
my opinion, straight to the separation of 
children’s books from life as well as from 
literature. Children’s reading is not a 
problem to be solved by anyone. It is, or 
may be, a very wonderful, rich, and free 
experience which should never be cheap- 
ened by artificial stimulation or reward. 
The glow of enthusiasm a boy or girl 
brings to the first reading of a fine book 
to which he feels spiritual kinship is an 
infinitely precious thing to be cherished 
and respected. However old the book, it 
now lives again for a new reader, who
-P-A-G-E-10

may be very young, but who, if he has 
chosen to read it of his own free will, may 
be able to teach us—if we are in his con- 
fidence—something about the book we 
have never known before. And how may 
we be sure that we are in his confidence? 
We may not limit him, says Quiller-Couch, 
to the things we admire ourselves, lest we 
“pauperize his mind.” That means, I take 
it, that we must follow after and find him 
where he is in his own generation if we 
would build for ourselves new roads to 
childhood.

NEW “ROADS

CHAPTER ONE 
THE ROMANCE OF THE STREETS 
I am aready believer in relics, legends, 
and local anecdotes of goblins and great 
men; and would advise all travelers who 
travel for their gratification to be the same. 
—WASHINGTON IRVING 
RE you a citizen of New York?” 
“IT am,” I admitted joyfully. 
“JT thought you must be. I once met an- 
other citizen of New York in Westminster 
Abbey and he amused me greatly telling 
about the wonders of his city. 
“Tt is not very ancient but it is roman- 
tic. There are many strange peoples there 
and they live in strange streets. I should

  16 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
like to hear more about New York from 
a citizen. It seems more real than it does 
in any books I have read.” 
“How old are you?” I asked wonder- 
ingly, still under the spell of that arrest- 
ing phrase—“‘a citizen of New York”— 
which had fallen so naturally from the 
lips of this slender, delicate-looking boy 
with the deep-set burning eyes. He looked 
barely eleven years old. 
“Tm fourteen past, Miss. I’m leaving 
school to-morrow and I must find work to 
do. My sister wants to put me to a trade 
but I want to be a librarian. 
“T love books better than anything else 
in the world. I have a hundred and thirty 
books of my own—fourteen by Sir Walter 
Scott and thirty by Shakespeare. I save 
all my pennies to buy books. I can do 
without sweets but I can’t live without 
books. Just to stick the labels and file the 
cards of books I would like better than 
anything. 
“Do you think, Miss, I could get a posi- 
tion here?” 
I was standing at one of the bookshelves  
-P-A-G-E-15
ROMANCE OF THE STREETS 17 
of David Copperfield’s Library when this 
intense little being appeared at my side 
pouring forth in book language his eager 
tale of the books he owned and of those 
he had read. 
And when he had finished that story he 
told me another—of his dread of being 
“put to a trade” and of how when he had 
heard there was a library in the house 
where Charles Dickens once lived he had 
walked to it from Islington, his mind made 
up to be a librarian there. 
“Will you speak for me, Miss?’ he 
asked eagerly. 
It was not easy to tell a boy who wanted 
so much to be a librarian, that there was 
no money in the little house to pay any 
one for the work of carrying it on, but a 
way of telling him took shape in my mind 
when I discovered that it was his first 
visit to David Copperfield’s Library and 
that he had never seen a children’s library 
before. It was my first visit also, although 
I had seen many children’s libraries and 
had even found work in one. We would 
look about this place together, just as he
-P-A-G-E-16
  18 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
had walked about Westminster Abbey 
with that unknown genial person—‘“an- 
other citizen of New York”—whose tales 
of wonder he carried home with him to 
Islington. 
The little rooms of the old house of 
Dickens’ boyhood were filled with chil- 
dren who might have stepped that very 
day from the pages of Charles Dickens so 
little is Somers Town changed from the 
days of the Micawbers—so perfect the 
transcript of life experienced there by 
David Copperfield. 
With books of their own choice in their 
hands, these children were “reading for 
life” just as he did. In his low chair be- 
side the fire sat another Tiny Tim. So 
like him that when he smiled I reached 
instinctively for the hand of my com- 
panion. 
“There’s Tiny Tim!” I said, and the 
boy from Islington whispered, as he 
slipped his hand into mine: 
“T should like, Miss, just to sit down 
and read a book here.” 
I left him then, his trouble forgotten for
-P-A-G-E-17
ROMANCE OF THE STREETS 19 
the time, and stole out of those mysterious 
rooms where bright ghosts of Charles 
Dickens were taking on living form more 
rapidly than brain or heart could bear 
without “space and air in the mind.” 
Downstairs I fled to the “Fairy Dun- 
geon” presided over by the elder sister of 
Tiny Tim. Florry Adams had “found her- 
self” at the early age of scant twelve 
years. Not only did she tend her little 
crippled brother with deep devotion and 
tenderness, she had proved that she could 
“mind” any number of restless little broth- 
ers and sisters and give them all a good 
time. 
In Mrs. Micawber’s old kitchen Florry’s 
word was law. To those too young to 
listen to the stories she read or told as the 
spirit moved her, she gave toys—each after 
his kind—and freedom to play within the 
law which she expounded as the occasion 
demanded with strict sense of justice, im- 
agination, and a saving measure of true 
Cockney wit. 
“What are you reading to them?’ I 
asked.
-P-A-G-E-18
  
20 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
“Firy tiles, Miss. 
“They like firy tiles so I alwiys read firy 
tiles. It would be a wiste of time to bring 
any other books to the Dungeon.” 
It certainly would, I silently agreed as 
I passed from the Fairy Dungeon to the 
Wigwam, the favorite haunt of the older 
boys. The Wigwam was once Mrs. Micaw- 
ber’s parlor. A ring of boys from twelve 
to fifteen years old were sitting about the 
historic little grate completely lost in the 
books they were reading. 
What were they reading? 
They too were reading “firy tiles. “At 
the Back of the North Wind,’ The 
Arabian Nights, Hans Andersen, King 
Arthur, Robin Hood, English Fairy 
Tales, were all in their hands and later 
in the evening they told me that they 
cared most of all for stories of romance 
and adventure. 
Thad come to test the reality of this lit- 
tle library to the children of the neighbor- 
hood, but long before I saw the inside of 
it, I knew what the children thought of it
-P-A-G-E-19
ROMANCE OF THE STREETS 21 
for I arrived alone in time to mingle with 
the gathering crowd in the street outside. 
If the street is drab and sordid, not so 
the children. They are as remarkable, as 
colorful, as richly imaginative, in life as 
they are in fiction. 
From the moment I appeared on the 
scene the freedom of the Borough of St. 
Pancras, as well as that of their library, 
was mine. I felt as if I had known the 
children of Somers Town always, al- 
though I had never seen one of them before. 
With that instinctive, deep-rooted cour- 
tesy and definiteness which was to impress 
me more and more strongly as the evening 
wore on, one of them called out: “Mike 
wiy for the lidy!” and the crowd fell back 
from the steps as if by magic. 
, Crossing the threshold of the house of 
Charles Dickens’ boyhood, just ahead of 
the staff of twenty boys and girls who had 
been entrusted with its administration, I 
watched them disappear into the scullery 
behind Mrs. Micawber’s kitchen. 
In a very few minutes they reappeared 
with shining faces and incredibly clean 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  22 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
hands, clothed in smocks of blue or brown 
linen. Swiftly, quietly, and competently, 
they took up their various posts of duty. 
The Master of Keys gradually admitted 
the waiting readers to the number the 
house would hold and they passed in turn 
to the Master of Soap and Towels, the 
Master of Robes, and the Master of Books. 
~They were soon choosing the books they 
wanted to read from the shelves and here 
it was my privilege to mingle with them. 
Never before have I seen children touch 
library books with such love and respect, 
and I soon saw that this proceeded from 
their natural love of books and a genuine 
regard for their outward form. 
I was not surprised to learn that it had 
been their own decision to leave the books 
in their library rather than allow them to 
be taken home. Their library was a safer 
place for books than their homes, and they 
knew it. 
Establishing a plan of administration 
had been very simple. As soon as the chil- 
dren knew that they were to have a library 
they knew exactly what they wanted to do  
-P-A-G-E-21
ROMANCE OF THE STREETS 23 
there—to read undisturbed and to take 
care of their books. Since the books were 
all in their original covers, many of them 
in beautiful and perishable bindings, it 
was suggested that they might like to slip 
into smocks themselves instead of putting 
paper covers on the books. 
They took to the idea of wearing smocks 
like ducks to water, not merely for the 
sake of the books, but because it gave them 
a sense of transformation. The smocks 
were a touch of costume, not a livery. 
Taking over the management of their 
library was an idea born of that practical 
necessity with which these children were 
familiar in every circumstance of their 
daily lives. 
“The play’s the thing,’ and carrying 
out the idea called for a creative concep- 
tion of the whole nature of the work, dra- 
matic presentation of it, and absolute faith 
in the children. I have seen millions of 
children reading in well-ordered libraries 
in poor neighborhoods. I know something 
of the measure of their influence and the 
cost of sustaining it, but I have never been
-P-A-G-E-22
24. NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
so profoundly moved as by what I saw and 
felt in David Copperfield’s Library. The 
quest of beauty and romance still goes on 
in the streets of Somers Town. The chil- 
dren’s ready response in giving their serv- 
ices to making and carrying on such a 
library there is in itself a proof of that. 
No one watching the face of one of those 
remarkable boys swinging far out to sea 
in a book of his own choice, or that of an- 
other, tearing the heart out of his with the 
intensity of his reading, can have any 
doubt of it. 
“What a fine thing it is,” someone says, 
“to have such a library to keep the chil- 
dren off the streets.”’ Off the streets! Oh, 
no! I who lingered on in the little house 
with the Boy from Islington after all the 
readers had gone knew that they carried 
the crock of gold back into the streets 
with them. 
After their work was done, we sat about 
the Council fire in the Wigwam with Tiny 
Tim, the Keeper of the Fairy Dungeon, 
the Master of Books, the Master of Keys 
and all the others. And the Boy from
-P-A-G-E-23

Islington joined in the songs they sang, 
and in the ringing cheers they gave for 
friends in New York, and laughed heart- 
ily at the funny stories they told. When 
it was time to go there was no longer any 
need of telling him that the children of 
Somers Town were not paid for working 
in their library. He knew it already and 
he also knew that some of them were leav- 
ing school and must find paid work just as 
he was trying to do. The strain began to 
ease up then. 
“IT have never seen a library like this 
before,” he said. ‘I shall remember this 
evening a long time.” 
The Boy from Islington turned home- 
ward at the first corner, leaving the full 
staff of David Copperfield’s Library to 
escort me to the frontier of Somers Town 
where they took leave even more cordially 
than they had received me in Johnson 
Street four hours before. 
A few days later I sat in the company 
of those assembled at the Mansion House 
by invitation of the Lord Mayor, to testify 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  26 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
to the value of David Copperfield’s Li- 
brary, which was that day being turned 
over to the great City of London. 
It was All-Hallows Day, the first of 
November—the very day, so the story 
runs, that Dick Whittington heard Bow 
Bells at Halloway: 
Turn again, Whittington, 
Thrice Lord Mayor of London. 
Never had I dreamed of coming so close 
to Whittington and the heart of London. 
We were all sitting in the Egyptian 
Room of the Mansion House—those who 
had given of their art, their time, their 
books, and their money, to transform the 
wretched house of Charles Dickens’s boy- 
hood into a children’s library. 
The Burgomaster of Leyden had come 
over from Holland bringing a gift of 
Dutch children’s books in token of the ad- 
miration of his countrymen for the great 
novelist. The French Ambassador had 
already placed the books sent by his Gov- 
ernment on the shelves of the little house. 
Kate Douglas Wiggin had flung a golden
-P-A-G-E-25
ROMANCE OF THE STREETS 27 
cable across the Atlantic. And now we 
were listening to the living words of an- 
other great novelist—John Galsworthy 
was telling of the romance and mystery 
of the streets, and picturing childhood as 
the time of all others when the reading of 
a book becomes a true adventure on un- 
charted seas. 
“It is the realest children’s library I 
have ever seen,” I said at last, ‘“‘the chil- 
dren have made it so by their own gift of 
intelligent work.” 
And then I told how I had gone to see 
it first from the outside through the eyes 
of children waiting for the doors to be 
opened. Then from the inside with the 
little booklover of Islington—the boy who 
wanted to be a librarian, who thought of 
New York as a city of wonders—a place 
of strange people and strange streets—who 
hailed her travelers as “citizens,” the boy 
who came to David Copperfield’s Library 
looking for work and carried away from it 
only the memory of something he had 
never seen or felt before.

Charles Dickens alone could picture 
such a boy and his need in memorable 
words. I can only remind you of his con- 
tinued existence.

Louis,

—ALFRED NOYES 
HAVE been telling stories in David 
 Copperfield’s Library,” writes Marie 
Shedlock, the fairy godmother of the 
American library story hour. 
Although she had often told her dra- 
matic stories at Rugby, Cheltenham, and 
other English schools and colleges, Miss 
Shedlock had never before told stories in 
a children’s library in England—a chil- 
dren’s library with an intimate background 
of books and pictures so placed as to invite 
29
-P-A-G-E-28
  30 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
reading for sheer love of it—‘‘making 
reading a regular sport,” as one American 
boy has characterized it. “I had a won- 
derful audience of boys,’ Miss Shedlock 
tells us; “they came out of one of the most 
sordid quarters of London—they were 
simply delightful and completely absorbed 
in the stories.” 
What kind of stories did she tell the 
boys of Somers Town? Nothing short of 
her best. Miss Shedlock mentions no titles 
rhe we can be certain there was mystery, 
adventure, nonsense, and some reflection 
of the great poetry at the heart of litera- 
ture. One of the stories may have been 
the legend of the Welshman who met the 
sorcerer on London Bridge, for it is a 
favorite story with both English and 
American boys and Miss Shedlock includes 
it in the admirable selection of stories to 
be found in her own book ‘The Art of the 
Story-teller’”—a book which May Sinclair 
says every writer of stories should read, 
since it is amusing as well as wise. For 
the story-teller it remains the best book on 
the subject.
-P-A-G-E-29
COPPERFIELD’S LIBRARY 31 
The story of David Copperfield’s Li- 
brary begins with the eleventh chapter of 
David Copperfield with its intimate record 
of what we now know to have been Charles 
Dickens’s daily life with the Micawbers. 
“My address,’ said Mr. Micawber, “is 
Windsor Terrace, City Road. J—in 
short,” said Mr. Micawber, with the same 
genteel air, and in another burst of con- 
fidence, “I live there.” 
The small house in Windsor Terrace 
was shabby in Mr. Micawber’s day. It 
may be remembered that he often went 
to bed ‘making a calculation of the ex- 
pense of putting bow windows to the house 
‘in case anything turned up.’ ”” 
Nearly a century went by before any- 
thing did turn up, and then one day in 
1911 the London County Council appeared 
in Johnson Street, Somers Town, bringing 
a small tablet with this inscription: 
Charles Dickens 
1812-1870 
Novelist 
Lived Here 
in Boyhood 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  32 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
The tablet was fastened to a house bearing 
the number 13 in a terrace of tottering 
brick cells. It is significant that it should 
have been placed between the two front 
windows of the first floor. In the Micaw- 
bers’ day “‘the first floor was altogether 
unfurnished and the blinds were kept 
down to delude the neighbors.” The Lon- 
don County Council, having done its duty, 
went away again and nothing else hap- 
pened until the early spring of 1920, when 
to a young man walking through Somers 
Town this “Tiny Tim of a house,” as it 
has been called, came alive. ‘Some houses 
live and others die; some have the gift of 
perpetual youth.” 
A Dickens lover by inheritance, the Rev- 
erend J. Brett Langstaff, who was at the 
time in charge of Magdalen College 
House, lost no time in writing to his par- 
ents in America: 
I have discovered a house in which Dickens 
lodged during the David Copperfield part of 
his boyhood. It is a small building, a door 
and a window on the ground floor and above 
that two floors, each staring drearily out into 
the narrow street. The conditions have re-
-P-A-G-E-31
COPPERFIELD’S LIBRARY 33 
mained unchanged since the time Dickens took 
his first impressions as a boy. The appeal for 
the people and especially for the children is the 
same as he makes in his novels. It seems to me 
that if one could make in this David Copperfield 
house a happy book world for the boys and 
girls it would in some way make up for the 
miserable times Dickens had when as a lad of 
thirteen he lodged there with Mrs. Pipchin, be- 
cause his father (Mr. Micawber) was most of 
the time in a debtor’s prison. I would have the 
furnishing throughout of the Dickensian period 
and on a miniature scale so that one would feel 
a true giant on entering unless one were a child. 
I would not have a nursery in any sense but a 
teal library for children, filled with books and 
pictures and pictures and books from top to 
bottom. And for those who could not read I 
would have someone come to read or tell stories. 
Two months after this letter was written 
an attractive and convincing illustrated 
circular appeared in England containing a 
letter of indorsement of the idea from 
Henry Fielding Dickens and a group of 
councilors bearing names touched with 
power and magic—Sir James Barrie, Ken- 
neth Grahame, Edmund Gosse, John Gals- 
worthy, H. G. Wells, and others. Nor 
was the interest confined to writers. The

actors gave a Charles Dickens Birthday 
Matinée arranged by Ben Greet, a substan- 
tial sum of money was realized from this 
performance, the freehold of 13 Johnson 
Street was received as a gift, and the re- 
construction of the old house was begun. 
It was still in the hands of the workmen 
when I visited it one hot afternoon in July, 
1921, on my way back from the Eton- 
Harrow match at Lord’s Cricket Ground 
—the caretaker’s twins asleep in Mrs. 
Micawber’s parlor lending a touch of real- 
ity to its tradition. A workman took us 
from bottom to top of the house, new and 
delightful possibilities revealing them- 
selves at every turn. Since then the 
Micawbers’ parlor has been converted into 
a reading room for the older boys and girls, 
and the kitchen behind it into a kind of 
“fairy dungeon” for little brothers and 
sisters who have to be “minded.” The 
extension, comprising a washroom and 
scullery built out into a small back yard, 
is now used as a place for the children to 
wash their hands. The old copper in 
which the Christmas pudding was steamed,

COPPERFIELD’S LIBRARY 35 
remains where it was in Dickens’s day, 
while on the floor above—the mysterious 
first floor—its two rooms connected by 
folding doors, the books of David Copper- 
field’s Library are to be found. Between 
the two front windows, where a school- 
mate remembered Charles Dickens kept 
his own books in a cupboard, stands a 
small chiffonier containing the books Dick- 
ens read as a boy, together with a selected 
edition of his works, presented by his pub- 
lishers. The low book shelves fitted to the 
adjoining walls contain some five hundred 
volumes presented by English and Ameri- 
can authors, illustrators, and publishers. 
There is also a gift of children’s books 
from the French Government. The front 
room is decorated with three large panels 
in color, representing Dick Whittington, 
the Babes in the Woods, and the children 
of China. These crayon drawings, with 
three others representing the children of 
Canada, Russia, and India, are the work 
of L. Leslie Brooke, whose picture books 
are much loved in American children’s 
libraries. They were chosen by Miss Shed-

original sketches by Raven Hill, Frank 
Reynolds, H. M. Bateman, and other il-

Here is also the poem in manuscript writ- 
ten by Alfred Noyes on the occasion of 
establishing the library, and the letter

Copperfield’s room, second floor back,

“My room was at the top of the house at 
the back, a close chamber; stencilled all 
over with an ornament which my young 
imagination represented as a blue muffin; 
and very scantily furnished.” 
In this room, no doubt, was conceived 
the plan of the distinctive Souvenir Book 
printed in connection with the play at 
Devonshire House last November—a re- 
vival of Bulwer-Lytton’s comedy ‘Not So 
Bad as We Seem,” produced by Nigel

Playfair with the support of contemporary 
representatives of art and letters, under the 
patronage of Queen Alexandra. The play 
was originally produced by Charles Dick- 
ens and his circle in 1851 and the Souvenir 
Book contains a picture of the stage at 
Devonshire House, the royal box with 
Queen Victoria and King Albert seated in 
it, a section of the audience, and a 
reproduction of the play bill. The poem 
written and read by Alfred Noyes, as 
an epilog to the production of 1921, is here 
given in its entirety. Mr. Noyes has 
caught and recorded the spirit and essence 
of the children’s library idea for any 
country. 
Hugh Walpole’s fine tribute to Mrs. 
Ewing and Mrs. Molesworth will not sur-

the children’s library idea to his father’s

A. E. Richardson describe Somers Town.

There is a reproduction of Hanslip Fletch- 
er’s sketch of No. 13 Johnson Street and 
of a delectable cartoon by Bateman repre- 
senting “Eustace, the child who, having 
read every volume in David Copperfield’s 
Library, asks for more.” Bernard Shaw 
says, “The first condition of a children’s 
library is that there should be no children’s 
books in it,” reminding us that ‘Dickens 
. read Smollett and Fielding and all 
the other grown up books he could lay his 
hands on (as I did myself). But Dickens 
also read the books on the lower branches 
of “The Christmas Tree,” and if ever a 
book belonged in a children’s library it is 
his own nonsense story “The Magic Fish- 
bone.” The spirited and childlike pictures 
Francis Bedford has made for the new edi- 
tion of it might have been conceived at 
13 Johnson Street. The Princess Alicia 
with her seventeen children to be 
“minded” would revel in the “fairy dun- 
geon.” The picture representing Dickens 
and little Alice Rainbird was hailed with 
joy in an American children’s library 
whose birthday was once celebrated by

Kate Douglas Wiggin, as an authentic 
portrait of that author at the age of seven. 
“Why not a ‘Dickens Reader’?” asks 
Mrs. Belloc Lowndes. Because there is 
abundant evidence in England and Amer- 
ica that readers made up of selections from 
great authors are too often joy killers to 
potential readers in the flesh. Children 
no more than grown ups like literature 
presented piecemeal. Better typography, 
a freer field for the artist who has the gift 
of seeing something new in an old book, 
more variability in joutward form, the 
break up of traditional sets and series 
which look alike and look du//—these are 
important considerations in the publication 
of books for children at the present time. 
When they have been more effectively 
acted upon, children’s libraries will scrap 
the type of book which Carl Van Doren so 
aptly characterizes as “immental.” Al- 
though applied to the American novel, the 
word fits the kind of book I suspect Mr. 
Shaw has in mind when he says “no chil- 
dren’s books.” 
“I dare say you might like a present of
-P-A-G-E-40
  42 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
books,” writes Hilaire Belloc to David 
Copperfield’s Library; “and, if so, let me 
know which of my books may be of service 
to you.” Would that more gifts to libra- 
ries were preceded by a similar inquiry! 
Isn’t Mr. Belloc’s “Cautionary Tales” too 
sophisticated or too suggestive of wrong 
things to do, to place in a poor neighbor- 
hood? This question may not have been 
put in England, but it is sure to be in 
America, where a new edition of these non- 
sense verses with their inimitable illustra- 
tions (“The nicest things you ever saw’’) 
has just appeared. Those who “see no 
sense” in Edward Lear will probably see 
none in Mr. Belloc. But I would deprive 
no boy or girl of the privilege of making © 
acquaintance with Henry King, who 
chewed Bits of String, Rebecca, who 
slammed Doors for Fun, and Charles Au- 
gustus Fortesque, who always Did what 
was Right, and so accumulated an Immense 
Fortune. Humor, the most democratizing 
of all influences, is too seldom trusted to 
do its own work in its own way. 
Fortunately, David Copperfield’s Li-
-P-A-G-E-41
COPPERFIELD’S LIBRARY 43 
brary did not inherit a fixed selection of 
books, and I find it a refreshing thing to 
speculate which of ‘the new books one 
would like to have tried out in a new en- 
vironment. The book which attaches it- 
self first by giving a picture of child life 
in London a hundred years ago is ““Mem- 
oirs of a London Doll,” written by her- 
self and edited by Mrs. Fairstar. This 
little book was first published in Boston 
in 1852 and has been out of print for a 
number of years. The Swedish picture 
book by Elsa Beskow, called “Lillelbror’s 
Segelfard,” is another. The pictures alone 
tell the story of a little boy who sails away 
to see the world, just as Beatrix Potter’s 
pictures tell her stories. 
Walter de la Mare must already have 
sent his “Peacock Pie” and with it, per- 
haps, his charming new book of fairy 
poems “Down-Adown-Derry,” illustrated 
by Dorothy Lathrop. 
Sara Teasdale’s “Rainbow Gold” is a 
very real invitation to English as well as 
American children, to read poetry.

of all to send to David Copperfield’s Li-

the reproductions of her mural decorations 
for the Governor's Room and the Senate

printed under her direction, has. been

CHAPTER THREE 
ILLUSTRATING BOOKS FOR 
CHILDREN 
“What is the use of a book,” thought 
Alice, “without pictures or conversations?” 
—LEWIS CARROLL 
HE greatest artists are none too 
good to make drawings for chil- 
dren’s books,” wrote Rockwell Kent from 
Alaska in 1918. He tells of reading from 
a book of King Arthur stories to his nine 
year old son. “I don’t think the pictures 
in the book are half nice enough,” said 
Rockwell. “I think of a wonderful picture 
when you read the story and when I see the 
one in the book I’m disappointed.” 
No wonder the boy who watched the 
making of the drawings for “Wilderness” 
was disappointed by a conventionalized 
illustration for a King Arthur story. The 
45
-P-A-G-E-44
46 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
names of the artists are not given in the 
list of books mentioned in Rockwell Kent’s 
delightful journal of a winter spent in the 
wilds of Alaska, but I am quite ready to 
believe there wasn’t a breath of life in the 
King Arthur pictures and that the illustra- 
tions for Andersen’s Fairy Tales were 
also a disappointment. 
Every time I’ve opened ‘“‘Wilderness” I 
have been tempted to slip in a short list 
of books whose illustrations live in the 
memory and which I think would light up 
a cabin in Alaska or elsewhere for a boy 
like young Rockwell Kent. Since his 
father clearly states that imagination and 
romance in pictures and stories are what a 
child wants above everything else and that 
those qualities in illustration are the rarest, 
he may like to be reminded of a few books 
whose pictures possess them to a degree 
which sets them apart from all others. 
Without any hesitation at all, I should 
leave ‘Water Babies” behind to make 
room for the Ruskin Grimm—“German 
Popular Stories” is the title under which 
the first selection and translation of 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
BOOKS FOR CHILDREN 47 
Grimm’s Fairy Tales into the English 
language was reprinted, at Ruskin’s re- 
quest, in 1868. The book was edited by 
Edgar Taylor, who made the original 
translation just a hundred years ago in 
1823. Of the original etchings by George 
Cruikshank, Ruskin says they were unri- 
valed in masterfulness of touch since Rem- 
brandt, while to Gleeson White, after days 
spent in hunting up children’s books of the 
period, they appeared as masterpieces of 
design, justifying for the first time the 
great popularity of Cruikshank and giving 
almost the first glimpse of the modern 
ideal in illustration. 
In its present form the book is not at- 
tractive to children without introduction, 
but I have never known a child who did 
not respond to the inimitable drawing for 
“The Elves and the Shoemaker’ and, 
once discovered, turn back to it again and 
again. Of the versions of Grimm this is 
the most satisfactory to read aloud. Ethel 
Sidgwick has lately dramatized from it 
“The Giant with the Three Golden Hairs” 
and “The Robber Bridegroom,” keeping 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  48 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
very closely to her favorite text. Ruskin’s 
introduction in defense of children’s rights 
to their inheritance of fairy tales as the 
remnant of a tradition possessing historical 
value is even more needed today than at 
the time it was written, for on both sides 
of the water there has been far too much 
careless editing and rewriting of old fairy 
and folk tales to accompany new illustra- 
tions. ‘“Grimm’s Household Stories,” as 
pictured by Walter Crane, has delighted 
two generations of children in American 
public libraries and bids fair to hold a high 
place in years to come. 
And after I had put the Ruskin Grimm 
in place of “Water Babies” on the Alaska 
bookshelf, I would substitute for “The 
Tree Dwellers,’ the “Nonsense Books” of 
that prince of travelers and painter of 
mountains, Edward Lear. The first of 
these books appeared in 1846, the fourth 
and last in 1877. For “The Cave Dwell- 
ers,’ I would substitute Thackeray’s 
Christmas Pantomime “The Rose and the 
Ring” with his own matchless drawings, 
published in 1850. “The Sea People”
-P-A-G-E-47
BOOKS FOR CHILDREN = 49 
would give right of way to Tenniel’s 
“Alice” in the order of chronological 
sequence. The first volume appeared in 
1865, the second in 1871. 
To share the approach to any one of 
these books through the pictures and the 
artist’s personality as revealed by his con- 
temporaries is a delightful experience. If 
the text has seemed silly or has bored any- 
body, M. H. Spielmann’s “History of 
Punch” and the bound volumes of the 
magazine itself will send that person to look 
at the pictures in “Alice” and “Through 
the Looking Glass” with a new sense of 
wonder and admiration for the artist who 
took so much out of his own head. It is 
thrilling to boys and girls to know that Sir 
John Tenniel never forgot anything he had 
ever seen, and that he could reproduce it 
to the life. “I have a wonderful memory 
of observation,” he says, “not for dates 
but anything I see I remember.” When 
Lewis Carroll wanted him to use models 
for the illustrations of “Alice” he flatly re- 
fused and declared he needed none, any 
more than the author—a mathematician—
-P-A-G-E-48
  50 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
“needed a multiplication table to work a 
mathematical problem.” It has been said 
of Tenniel that his pictorial memory sur- 
passed his imagination but to “Alice” he 
brought both. “It is a curious fact,” he 
wrote some years later to Lewis Carroll, 
when asked to illustrate another of his 
books, “that with ‘Through the Looking 
Glass’ the faculty of making drawings for 
book illustrations departed from me and 
notwithstanding all sorts of tempting in- 
ducements, I have done nothing in that 
direction since.” 
I know of only one other artist who so 
perfectly realizes the conception of the 
author while communicating his own es- 
sential spirit. In his introduction to the 
new edition of “Uncle Remus: His Songs 
and His Sayings,” published in 1895, Joel 
Chandler Harris wrote of A. B. Frost’s 
illustrations: ‘You have breathed the 
breath of life into these amiable brethren 
of wood and field. By a stroke here and 
a touch there you have conveyed into their 
quaint antics the illumination of your own 
inimitable humor which is as true to our
-P-A-G-E-49
  
  BOOKS FOR CHILDREN 51 
sun and soil as it is to the spirit and essence 
of the matter set forth.” 
Gleeson White had said of Frost in 
“Children’s Books and Their Illustrators” : 
“By his cosmopolitan fun he has probably 
aroused more hearty laughs by his inim- 
itable books than even Caldecott himself.” 
The pity is that Frost has done no series 
of picture books corresponding to the 
Caldecott picture books of which “John 
Gilpin” published in 1878 was the first, 
and ‘The Great Panjandrum,” appearing 
in 1885, the last. The proposal to illus- 
trate these books to be printed in colors 
was made to Caldecott by Edmund Evans, 
who had begun printing the Walter Crane 
toy books more than ten years before. It 
is interesting to learn from Walter Crane’s 
“Reminiscences” that while Caldecott ar- 
ranged for the drawings of his toy books 
on a royalty basis, Walter Crane was never 
able to make a similar business arrange- 
ment for himself. Whether Caldecott’s 
motto “‘the fewer the lines the less error 
committed” had anything to do with it 
is difficult to affirm, but we like to think 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  52 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
it may have. There are far too many lines 
drawn which mean nothing in books de- 
signed for children. 
Caldecott’s love for animals and knowl- 
edge of them, his interest in everything 
connected with farming, markets, and 
country life in general, his lively humor 
and sense of beauty make of each of his 
picture books a pictorial record of Eng- 
land looking from the nineteenth century 
back to the eighteenth. 
Randolph Caldecott is bound to Amer- 
ica by many ties and by none more securely 
than those fastened upon him by the chil- 
dren of the public libraries. His illustra- 
tions for Washington Irving’s “Old 
Christmas” brought the book to life, and it 
is amusing to find that these illustrations 
were considered “‘inartistic, flippant, vul- 
gar and unworthy of the author” by one of 
the leading publishers of London when the 
drawings were submitted. “Old Christ- 
mas” was published in 1876. 
Caldecott met Mrs. Ewing while the 
story of “Jackanapes’” was simmering in 
her brain and at her request made a colored

BOOKS FOR CHILDREN 53 
sketch of a fair haired boy on a red haired 
pony. At this time he designed a cover for 
“Aunt Judy’s Magazine” and arranged to 
illustrate other stories of Mrs. Ewing, who 
had unbounded admiration for his work. 
After years of ill health Randolph Cal- 
decott died in St. Augustine, Florida, in 
1885. 
Kate Greenaway gives two or three 
charming glimpses of her friendship for 
Caldecott in the letters included in her 
Life and her correspondence with Ruskin, 
edited with rare interpretation of the artist 
and the child in “Kate Greenaway” by 
M. H. Spielmann and G. S. Layard. I do 
not suggest this book to take to Alaska, 
although I could be quite happy in reread- 
ing both text and drawings any time, 
anywhere. 
It is next to being in England in spring- 
time to look at these drawings of old cot- 
tages and farmhouses set in fields or 
gardens where flowers bloom more natu- 
rally than in any book I know and children 
dance and play with a grace, and gravity, 
and charm that Kate Greenaway alone

  54. NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
knew how to give. “Marigold Garden,” 
the “Pied Piper’ (of which 150,000 copies 
were sold), “A Day in a Child’s Life,” 
will be looked at with new eyes after read- 
ing what the critics of her own and other 
nations, notably the French, have said in 
praise of her art and her love of childhood 
for its own sake. The publication of 
“Under the Window” in 1878 gave Kate 
‘Greenaway a place of her own in the world 
and doubtless was a determining influence 
in Boutet de Monvel’s decision to make 
picture books of and for the children of 
France, for it was in that very year that 
he made the drawings for a French 
edition of St. Nicholas by which he be- 
‘came known as an illustrator. Delagrave, 
who asked Boutet de Monvel to make the 
illustrations for a child’s history of France, 
published this French S¢. Nicholas. Be- 
tween 1883 and 1897 Boutet de Monvel, 
a portrait and genre painter, was painting 
the children of France, creating and nam- 
ing characters so true to life that no one 
who has met them in his books will fail 
to recognize them in the Luxembourg Gar-
-P-A-G-E-53
BOOKS FOR CHILDREN 55 
dens or on their way to a village school in 
the Aisne. Many of Boutet de Monvel’s 
pictures are true portraits of his own chil- 
dren, or of his brothers and sisters as he 
remembered them. “Nos Enfants,” “Filles 
et Garcons,” “La Civilité,” “Vieilles Chan- 
sons,” and “Chansons de France”’ all record 
children playing, singing, and dancing 
under French skies. 
“Jeanne d’Arc’” was published in 1897 
and became deservedly popular among 
American children as soon as it was given 
a place in the children’s room of a public 
library as well as in its art department. 
I would take a copy to Alaska by all 
means, and preferably in the French lan- 
guage, to fix the authenticity of the book 
in the boy’s mind and stimulate a spon- 
taneous desire to read the simple text 
which accompanies the pictures. It is now 
possible to include two or three of Beatrix 
Potter’s little books which are as true to 
nature and art in the French language as 
in their native English. 
“Pierre Lapin” or “Jeannot Lapin,” ac- 
companied by Beatrix Potter’s Christmas

  56 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
story, “The Tailor of Gloucester,” in Eng- 
lish, would make a child or grown-up feel 
at home anywhere. 
Two books I should want to take to 
Alaska for their remarkable pictorial im- 
pressions of the north and the folk interest 
are: Snorre Sturlason’s “Kongesagaer,” 
which is illustrated by six of the leading 
artists of Norway, and “Norske Folk- 
eeventyr” illustrated by Erik Werenskiold. 
The illustrations in both books are unique 
in their power to reincarnate the old sagas 
and invest the life of both animals and 
people of the north with the racial inher- 
itance which belongs to them. Since 
neither of these books is readily obtainable 
for a journey I would make a point of 
asking a boy to go to see them wherever 
they could be found. Asking boys to look 
at certain special books in libraries or book- 
shops is a most interesting thing to do. If 
I could find a volume of St. Nicholas 
between the date of its first publication, 
1873, and 1883, I would certainly add it 
to the Alaskan collection, for among the 
pictures the drawings of the best artists of

the day would be reprinted. Mary Mapes 
Dodge did not hesitate to ask anyone, 
writer or artist, to do his best work for 
children. The reason why so many of the 
pictures in S¢. Nicholas are remembered 
is for the simple reason that the drawings 
were good and the subjects interesting. 
Howard Pyle was a contributor to Sz. 
Nicholas years before his illustrations for 
“Robin Hood,” “Pepper and Salt,” and 
“Wonder Clock” gave him his own place 
among American illustrators of children’s 
books. Palmer Cox, whose “Brownie 
Books” are still the favorite picture books 
in American libraries after more than forty 
years, made his first drawings for Sz. 
Nicholas. 
The good art of this American magazine 
stands out in constructive testimony of 
what could be done in a period when 
esthetic movements of one sort or another 
were playing, as they are still, with all 
sorts of things which had no bearing on 
the illustration of books for children. 
‘Young Rockwell Kent must be fourteen 
years old now. He came back from Alaska

  58 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
at the end of six months, but that book- 
shelf still intrigues my imagination and I 
should like to add to it two books of Lovat 
Fraser, “Nursery Rhymes” and “Pirates,” 
both of which have been received with 
enthusiasm by big boys and little ones in 
the children’s rooms of the libraries in the 
holidays of 1922. “Nursery lore remains 
with us, whether we would or not, for all 
our lives,” he says in his introduction to 
“Pirates,” published in 1913; “and gen- 
erations of ourselves, as schoolboys and 
pre-schoolboys, have tricked out Piracy in 
so resplendent a dress that she has fairly 
ousted in our affections, not only her sis- 
ter profession of ‘High Toby and the 
Road,’ but every other splendid and vil- 
lainous vocation.” 
The untimely death of Lovat Fraser in 
1921 is as great a loss to children’s books 
as to the dramatic world, which he en- 
riched by his “Beggar’s Opera.” 
To place “The Velveteen Rabbit” at the 
end of a bookshelf which spans a century 
of illustration of children’s books may 
seem a strange thing to do to those who

have not seen William Nicholson’s pictures 
for it, and who are unacquainted with the 
artist's remarkable character portraits 
which appeared about twenty-five years 
ago. 
Mr. Nicholson has always been thought 
of as the painter of what he sees. His 
character portrait of the old Queen with 
her dog done from life anticipated Lytton 
Strachey’s book by many years and sur- 
passes it for those pictorially minded. He 
has painted some remarkable portraits of 
children. 
Why should he be interested in bring- 
ing a velveteen rabbit—a child’s nursery 
toy—to life? I wanted to know so I went 
to Appletree Yard to ask him. The story 
touched him, he said, and he had taken it 
away with him on a holiday at the request 
of Sydney Pawling, who had fallen in 
love with the story, believed it a classic for 
children, and wanted to give it the best 
form he could devise. 
Mr. Nicholson had worked from models 
to some extent—I found the velveteen 
rabbit on the chimney piece in the studio,

the old skin horse had been in his family 
for many years—but it is his imaginative 
understanding of the past—the reality of 
children and their interests in his own 
life which enabled him to give personality 
to a velveteen rabbit in a nursery and place 
him in the open fields and woods with his 
wild brothers with a certainty of record 
that admits of no challenge by child or 
grown up. 
The children say of the pictures, “You 
can almost see the Velveteen Rabbit 
changing.”

O you wish a ticket to go away and 
come back, or do you wish a ticket 
to go away and never come back?” 
If Carl Sandburg’s sleepy eyed ticket 
agent had been sitting in a window of The 
Bookman office in New York in the year 
1918 and had asked me that question, I 
should have snatched W. H. Hudson’s 
“Little Boy Lost” and Hendrik Van 
Loon’s “Short History of Discovery” from 
reviewers’ shelves and I should have 
grabbed that new “long slick yellow 
leather slab ticket with a blue spanch

across it” and I should have run over Mur- 
ray Hill laughing and shouting, “It zs too 
much to be too long anywhere”—all the 
way to the Grand Central Station. 
Like Gimme the Ax, I should first have 
sold everything—lions, libraries, literary 
lights, lodgings, to buy that wonderful 
ticket to ride “on and on to where the 
railroad tracks run off into the blue sky” 
and everything is quite different from the 
way it always was. And when I had gone 
far enough out into the Rootabaga Coun- 
try—way béyond Chicago—and had seen 
the corn fairies stitching and laughing 
away under the harvest moon in Iowa, 
Kansas and Nebraska, I should have 
jumped on the observation car of the 
Golden Spike Limited and from the rear 
platform of that glorious “free child” of 
two city skyscrapers, I should have called 
back to everybody living anywhere: “Carl 
Sandburg, the poet, has written a remark- 
able book for children. I know because 
I’m seeing it all come true. Don’t wait 
for reviews. Get the book and read it 
aloud. It’s about America and all of us.”
-P-A-G-E-61
  WRITING FOR CHILDREN 63 
And after that I should have climbed 
into an upper berth of the Golden Spike 
Limited, and while the train rushed on to 
distant mountains and the sea, I should 
have dreamed every night of the two sky- 
scrapers leaning across the street to whis- 
per together in the city I’d left behind, of 
the Old Wooden Indian riding down Main 
Street on the back of the Shaghorn Buffalo, 
of the Balloon Pickers, the blue foxes, and 
the yellow flongboos ‘‘waving their long 
yellow tails like torches to light up their 
way over the prairie” ; of Rags Habbakuk, 
Any Ice Today, and an army of newsboys, 
firemen, and policemen. And when the 
Golden Spike Limited stopped at the 
Golden Gate I should have been the first 
person to step off the train to tell the chil- 
dren of the Pacific coast that “Rootabaga 
Stories” belonged to them quite as much as 
to the children of the east, of the middle 
west, and the south. 
It would have been easy for this re-

dren of the country. Hendrik Van Loon’s 
illustrations for the “Short History of Dis- 
covery” then looked so queer to the book- 
seller, that his first book was rarely to be 
found in any bookshop, although in daily 
use as a picture book in the children’s room 
of a public library. New writers with 
ideas and originality in expressing them 
were sorely needed in the field of children’s 
books. Writers of promise are bound to 
lose both spontaneity and dramatic force 
under pressure of writing a sequel or a 
series following a single successful book. 
It is a wise publisher who reminds himself 
of the six years between “Alice’s Adven- 
tures in Wonderland” and ‘“‘Through the 
Looking-Glass” before he asks an author 
te “do it again.” 
In contrasting the rich and varied out- 
put of children’s books in 1922 with the 
static conditions of 1918, illustrators no 
less than authors have disclosed new ways 
of looking at people and things.’ Such 
original work as that of Hendrik Van 
Loon in his pictorial histories and Hugh 
Lofting in his “Story of Doctor Dolittle”

Hilaire Belloc reminds us in ‘More Beasts

mammoth or the microbe and Oliver Her- 
ford’s inimitable personifications of wasps 
and worms, crickets and bumblebees, in a 
delightful new book called “The Bird- 
Nest Boarding House” by Verbena Reed, 
will raise a laugh with a deeper interroga- 
tion born of the desire to share an experi- 
ence of getting at life rather than to pose 
before a child as a know-it-all. There 
have been many attempts to teach the

appreciation of art, but I know of none 
so effective as giving fine picture books 
and drawings right of way with children. 
Lovat Fraser’s pictures for “Nursery 
Rhymes” appears in an American edition 
this year, lending the pictorial fancy of 
this gifted artist of “The Beggar’s Opera” 
to “Hot Cross Buns!”, “An Old Man 
Clothed All in Leather,” and other fa- 
miliar rhymes. The book is reminiscent of 
the old broadsides and will lend color to 
any Christmas exhibition. 
The rarest of books is an acceptable 
Christmas story and “The Velveteen Rab- 
bit” by Margery Williams (who is Pamela 
Bianco’s mother) is destined to live in the 
remembrance of every child and grown- 
up who follows the adventures of the Vel- 
veteen Rabbit from his first appearing in 
a Christmas stocking until he is turned into 
a real bunny by the Nursery Magic Fairy. 
The story is told with simplicity and direct 
appeal to a child’s heart. The seven 
lithographic illustrations by William 
Nicholson suggest the freedom of wild 
rabbits in the fields and woods, as well as

and the old Skin Horse in the nursery. 
These pictures will make a charming frieze

Rose Fyleman, who has been uncon-

now plays “The Fairy Flute.” 
A real child looks out from Hilda 
Conkling’s “Shoes of the Wind” as from 
her earlier poems, but she appears more 
rarely in a playful and objective mood. 
She is growing more and more concerned 
with thoughts and feelings as she nears 
the teens, and in my judgment it would be 
wise to delay publication of her writing 
during the next few years. A judicious 
selection from the two books with appro-

priate line drawings would give Hilda 
Conkling a place on the shelves of a chil- 
dren’s library. These shelves are enriched 
by several new anthologies. Sara Teas- 
dale’s “Rainbow Gold” is a small and ex- 
ceedingly well chosen selection of poems 
for children of over, rather than under, ten 
years. The decorative illustrations for the 
book are by Dugald Walker and the intro- 
duction by the compiler is a direct invita- 
tion to read poetry for its own sake. Mary 
G. Davis has compiled a selection of 
poetry of personal interest to girls in the 
teens, basing it upon her own natural ap- 
preciation of poetry and her intimate ex- 
perience with girls in library clubs and 
story hours. Dorothy Canfield has written 
the introduction to a book which supplies 
a very real need in books for girls. 
“The Way of Poetry” contains an 
introduction by its compiler, John 
Drinkwater. 
“Battles and Enchantments” is not a 
book of poems, but one of Irish folklore 
retold by an American poet, Norreys Jeph-

Mr. O’Conor has applied both head and 
heart to recreating these old romances in a 
form appealing to boys and girls, as well 
as to the mature reader and lover of Celtic 
legend. “Mighty Mikko” is the title given 
by Parker Fillmore to his fairy and folk 
tales from the Finnish. This rendering of 
stories hitherto locked away in the Kale- 
vala is a capital piece of work and reveals 
a fine appreciation of the storehouse from 
which Mr. Fillmore drew. Jay Van 
Everen has illustrated the book in black 
and white with a colored frontispiece. 
Anyone who thinks of the North Amer- 
ican Indian as always serious should study 
the fascinating pictures made from the 
paintings and sketches of two boys of the 
Hopi Tribe for “Taytay’s Tales.” These 
stories were collected by Elizabeth Willis 
De Huff, who first told them to the three 
children to whom the book is dedicated. 
Some of the tales are like Uncle Remus 
stories and all of them are very well told. 
The book is a distinct addition to Indian 
lore and will lend color to an experience 
of travel in the Desert.

Ernest Thompson Seton has told the life

by the author. 
Samuel Scoville, Jr., writes interest- 
ingly of raccoons, black bears, and other 
animals in “Wild Folk.” Fortunately for 
other boys, Mr. Scoville is sharing with 
them out of doors experiences he has en- 
joyed with his own son. This attractive 
book is illustrated by Charles Livingston 
Bull and Carton Moorepark. 
James Willard Schultz tells one of his 
best stories in “The Trail of the Spanish

Queen, a buckskin mare, who finally

Saskatchewan. 
Stewart Edward White has written a

as a children’s book it is eagerly read by 
older boys and girls. 
Dan Beard’s first story book for boys— 
“Black Wolf Pack”—is of special interest 
to Boy Scouts, but it is the sort of book 
any boy, or any man who carries his boy- 
hood with him, will like to read. Mr. 
Beard knows the American boy from a 
lifetime of daily association with him and 
he has made notable contributions to the 
literature of boyhood. Moreover, he 
knows how frontiersmen talk and carries 
the eye of an artist as well as a nature 
lover when he goes into the woods. 
American admirers of “Shasta of the 
Wolves” will look forward to reading Olaf 
Baker’s “Dusty Star.” Paul Bransom has

It is not generally known that Padre 
Luis Coloma, the novelist, has written a

the loss of the first tooth. 
The adventures of a family of mice who 
lived in an old rectory in Denmark are 
told in “The Mouse Story,” an amusing 
and well known Danish tale by K. H. 
With. This story has been translated 
by Gerda F. Behrens and Dorothea Prall. 
The illustrations by V. Y. Fischer are as 
quaint as the story. 
Katharine Adams has created a charm-

“Stories by Mrs. Molesworth” have 
been selected by Sydney Baldwin and il- 
lustrated by Edna Cooke, forming a com- 
panion volume to “Stories by Mrs. 
Ewing,” published last year. While I 
prefer the separate stories in an English 
edition, I am prepared to welcome the 
stories of either of these favorite writers 
of Hugh Walpole’s nursery days in any 
form assuring a wider acquaintance among 
American children.

Brock’s illustrations are so exactly what 
the text calls for that I think the artist 
must have loved the little book in 
childhood. 
Elizabeth Shippen Green Elliott has 
illustrated Charles and Mary Lamb’s 
“Tales from Shakespeare” with very real 
appreciation of what lies behind this much 
loved book. Her frontispiece tells the 
story pictorially and with fidelity to 
Shakespearian detail. In it Shakespeare 
appears presenting his book to Queen 
Elizabeth and below are the smaller figures 
of Charles and Mary Lamb presenting the 
first edition of their book with the William 
Blake frontispiece to the children for 
whom they made it. A holiday edition of 
“Master Skylark,” illustrated by Henry 
Pitz, represents a very different approach 
to the Shakespearian period. John Ben- 
nett’s story needs no word of praise. Kay 
Nielsen’s illustrations for “East of the 
Sun and West of the Moon” appear in a 
new edition of a notable book. Frances 
Jenkins Olcott has edited a new selection 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
74 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
of “Grimm’s Fairy Tales” with illustra- 
tions by Rie Cramer, a Dutch artist. Miss 
Olcott has also made a useful collection 
for libraries and schools which she calls 
“Good Stories for Great Birthdays.” 
Padraic Colum says he has done the last 
of his editing and retelling of the classics 
for children in the selection he has made 
from “The Arabian Nights.” Two charm- 
ing little books of plays to be acted or 
read are Cornelia Meigs’ “Helga and the 
White Peacock”—she put trolls into her 
story with a sure sense of the northern 
tale—and Netta Syrett’s “The Fairy 
Doll,” which includes “Christmas in the 
Forest” and other short plays. Ethel 
Sidgwick, the novelist, says that she has 
used her favorite text for the two fairy 
tales from the Brothers Grimm which she 
has dramatized—the Ruskin Grimm it is 
often called, although the translation was 
made by Edgar Taylor and the pictures 
by Cruikshank. Miss Sidgwick’s little 
book appeared in England in an attractive 
paper cover as “Two Plays for Schools.” 
The American edition bears the title of one

of the plays, “The Three Golden Hairs.” 
Old English folk songs are very happily 
introduced, and the music for them is indi- 
cated in a note in the English edition 
which is unfortunately omitted from the 
American. 
Last of all there is “Martin Pippin in 
the Apple Orchard,” a book of as inde- 
scribable charm of its kind as ““Rootabaga 
Stories,” although it is quite different in its 
appeal. Probably Eleanor Farjeon never 
rode on the Golden Spike Limited al- 
though her grandfather (Joseph Jefferson) 
often did. But she has a way of “trans- 
porting” lesser readers than Mr. Beresford, 
who writes the introduction to the Amer- 
ican edition of her book. Girls of high 
school age who love poetry and romance 
and who like to dramatize plays from old 
tales will find a mine of treasure in Martin 
Pippin’s stories, while to those of us who 
know and love Sussex it is an ideal book 
to read aloud, as I read it under an old 
apple tree in a Staten Island garden. And,

HEN I saw “Moonshine and 
Clover” and “A Doorway in Fairy- 
land” clinging to the shelves of their Lon- 
don publisher in November 1922 and 
learned that both books were to be pub- 
lished in New York in early spring, my 
mind leaped to the delightful prospect of 
contrasting new stories of Laurence Hous- 
man with his tales of a generation ago, in 
a spring review of children’s books for 
The Bookman.

-P-A-G-E-76
  78 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
So I asked to have the new books sent 
to the steamer that I might read them for 
the first time on the homeward voyage. 
But never “A Doorway in Fairyland” nor 
a glimmer of “Moonshine and Clover” ap- 
peared on the France at Plymouth, and 
I waited four long months to look inside 
their covers and behold “The Blue Moon” 
rise from “A Doorway in Fairyland,” 
while “The Field of Clover,’ ““The House 
of Joy,” and “A Farm in Fairyland” yield 
tribute to both books, neither of which, 
as a matter of fact, offers any new stories 
at all. 
The publishers have wisely recorded in 
each volume the titles of the four collec- 
tions from which the stories are taken and 
the original dates of publication, but they 
have not been so careful as one could wish 
about the form. The paper, the sacrifice 
of initial letters, and the poor reproduc- 
tions of the “dear wood engraver,” as 
Clemence Housman is called by her artist 
brother who made the original designs, 
lead me to register a strong protest on a 
tendency to make an ordinary looking book
-P-A-G-E-77
STORY-TELLING 79 
out of an unusual one in the rapid pub- 
lication of folk and fairy tales. 
It is twenty-nine years since “A Farm 
in Fairyland” appeared as a new book, 
and I well remember that it found a rela- 
tively small number of readers among the 
children of an American public library 
during the years it remained in print. 
Within the past fifteen years, however, 
changes have been taking place under my 
direct observation which lead me to predict 
a large and expectant group of readers for 
“The Galloping Plough,” “The Rooted 
Lover” (in which a ruddy faced plow boy 
turns into a red poppy), “The Prince With 
the Nine Sorrows” (a story blessed with a 
“family fairy”), “The Luck of the Roses,” 
“The Wishing-Pot,” and A Capful of 
Moonshine.” ‘How is it that one gets to 
see a fairy?’ Toonie asks the old fagot 
maker on Drundle Head; and the old man, 
ignorant of spirit photography, replies: 
“There are some to whom it comes by na- 
ture; but for others three things are needed 
—a handful of courage, a mouthful of 
silence, and a capful of moonshine.”

  80 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
To quote from “Rocking-Horse Land” 
(a delightful birthday story destined to be 
a favorite in library story hours) is to 
deprive the reader of the joy of discovery. 
Girls of high school age, from twelve or 
thirteen on through the teens, will readily 
associate several of these stories with their 
reading of poetry, with old French ro- 
mances, with such books as “The Children 
of the Dawn,” Kipling’s “Brushwood 
Boy,” “The Happy Prince” of Oscar 
Wilde, with Barrie, with Laurence Hous- 
man’s garden play “Prunella,” with that 
more recent out of door fantasy conceived, 
not by an artist, but by a scientist, ‘The 
Treasure of the Isle of Mist”; and, as it 
becomes better known, with Eleanor Far- 
jeon’s “Martin Pippin.” 
Aline Kilmer loves the Housman tales. 
She tells me that she came by “‘The Field 
of Clover” when she was twelve and “A 
Farm in Fairyland” a year later, but she 
waited for “The Blue Moon’ until she 
was nearly eighteen. She has kept on 
reading the stories ever since she began 
and is now sharing them with her children.
-P-A-G-E-79
STORY-TELLING 81 
The story which stands out to me and 
to all the story-tellers in the New York 
Public Library, because we heard it per- 
fectly told in a setting which gave it some- 
thing of its own background, is ““A Chinese 
Fairy Tale.” Others may ask whether 
Laurence Housman invented the whole 
story—it has a very intricate plot—or 
whether he invested an old Chinese legend 
with his own experience of an artist’s life 
and aspiration. I shall never seek to 
know. I am quite content to accept it 
without speculation as the life story of a 
true artist to be told only by the rare story 
teller who is an artist in her own right. 
Marie Shedlock told the story of ‘Tiki- 
pu,” as she calls it, in the art gallery of 
Pratt Institute Free Library as a tribute 
to a librarian who, if she was not the first 
to discover, was the first to make a living 
connection between the art of reading with 
appreciation—as distinguished from the 
mere act of reading a book or seeking 
information from books in a library—and 
the other arts, including the art of the story 
teller. Mary Wright Plummer rarely

missed an art exhibition, a dramatic or a 
musical event of any significance. When 
she learned that an English story-teller 
was telling dramatic stories in French as 
well as in English at a series of matinées 
for children at Sherry’s, she knew at once 
that she wanted to hear the stories and see 
the children. 
The library story hour was unknown in 
1900, but these miniature dramas—‘‘The 
Tin Soldier,” ‘The Swineherd,” ‘The 
Princess and the Pea’”’—seemed to belong 
naturally among the resources of a chil- 
dren’s room. Why should not they be 
given a chance there? No one who heard 
a story told as these stories are told 
could possibly forget it. Hans Ander- 
sen’s “Fairy Tales’ might live forever, 
not merely in the hearts of children, 
as was said when he died, but in their 
minds. Everything about children in- 
terested Miss Plummer, but she was al- 
ways concerned with their minds. Char- 
acteristically and courageously (for the 
story telling of the time was laden with 
information, elocution, and propaganda),
-P-A-G-E-81
  
STORY-TELLING 83 
Miss Plummer invited Miss Shedlock to 
come over Brooklyn Bridge and tell her 
stories first to the trustees, directors, and 
teachers in various departments of Pratt 
Institute, which at that time included a 
kindergarten and a high school so far in 
advance of the time as to anticipate in 
practice many things strongly urged by 
Quiller-Couch in “The Art of Writing” 
and “The Art of Reading.” Story-telling 
for the grown people soon led to a mem- 
orable story hour for children. The cir- 
culation of books was stopped one Satur- 
day morning and the children came to their 
room to listen to stories while the books 
stood listening also. 
There was never any doubt in my mind 
after that morning that a children’s library 
should have a regular story hour, but find- 
ing a story-teller of the right sort was not 
an easy matter. Poor story telling is more 
disastrous than poor story writing, which 
can be skipped or left entirely alone with- 
out affecting anyone else. I had been con- 
scious from the first months of my personal 
work in a children’s room of the need for

investing reading with dramatic interest 
and pictorial tradition, if it were to have 
any real meaning in the daily lives of hun- 
dreds of children who were coming to the 
library—many of them from very sordid 
homes—with all the freedom of voluntary 
and familiar association. 
For a year I carried on an experimental 
story hour, inviting different people to 
come to tell stories while I listened with 
the children. I learned a very great deal 
from listening. In the spring of that year 
Miss Shedlock came back again and told 
Hans Andersen’s “Nightingale.” It woke 
the story-teller for whom I had been wait- 
ing so long, and on May Eve, a Robin 
Hood story from Howard Pyle and a true 
story out of her own childhood marked the 
first of Anna Cogswell Tyler’s distinctive 
contributions to story-telling. Two years 
later she was appointed to assist in an or- 
ganization of the work with children in 
the New York Public Library which called 
for a projection of the library story hour 
and reading club to meet the varying needs 
and desires of children from the picture

book age on through a continuous range 
of old and new fairy and folk tales, myths 
and legends, poetry and romance, mystery 
and drama, history and biography. Miss 
Tyler's natural gift of understanding 
adolescent boys and girls in their relation- 
ship to the theater and to other forms of 
recreation, as well as to the schools, the 
museums, and their own homes, has con- 
tributed much to the fund of actual knowl- 
edge of those associative tastes in which 
appreciation takes root. Her direction of 
the work has been continuous for nearly 
the entire period of fifteen years to which 
I have referred, and the impact from her 
groups of readers may be traced all over 
Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island. 
Miss Tyler’s ‘Twenty-four Unusual 
Stories,” is a discriminating selection from 
a wide range of literary sources of those 
stories to which the boys and girls of her 
story hours listened with keen and re- 
peated enjoyment. Two of Sir Arthur 
Quiller-Couch’s best short stories, “My 
Grandfather Hendry Watty” and “The 
Roll-Call of the Reef” are here brought
-P-A-G-E-84
  86 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
into active association with other stories 
for the first time in a form acceptable to 
boy and girl readers. The entire selection 
is reinforced and enlivened in its arrange- 
ment by the dramatic gift of a story teller 
whose art was her own. Among the stories 
for Hallowe’en is a prose version of Tam 
O’Shanter, made by Miss Tyler herself. 
The collection has taken a new place 
among books of its kind as a book for gen- 
eral reading as well as for the story teller. 
While the library story hour has been 
under my immediate observation as regis- 
tering fresh powers of appreciation and a 
vastly extended range of interest in read- 
ing among the youth of the time, I am con- 
scious that the schools, notably the English 
departments of private schools and high 
schools, have enlivened their courses and 
are giving more attention to those interests 
in reading which spring from the love of 
the thing itself rather than as a means to 
an end. The same thing is true in the 
placing of exhibits, in the Museums of Art 
and Natural History, and the more hu- 
manized lectures and stories for small
-P-A-G-E-85
  
  STORY-TELLING 87 
groups given in connection with them. 
The tendency here is still too strong to give 
more information than exposure to the sub- 
ject warrants. I know of no better anti- 
dote for too much museum at one time 
than reading out of such a book as W. H. 
Hudson’s “A Traveller in Little Things.” 
There are some half dozen short chapters 
about little girls, including ‘“‘A Little Girl 
Lost,” which are more revealing of Hud- 
son’s understanding and love of children 
than a whole book on the subject by 
another writer. ' 
That reading has been coming into even 
closer association with the drama in the 
experience of boys and girls in their teens 
than in that of their elders, must have been 
observed by all who are having any oppor- 
tunity to talk with them. The boys and 
girls seem to me to have the signal advan- 
tage of a more informed approach to dra- 
matic stories and plays as well as a clearer 
sense of beauty and form. 
Investing books and reading with a dra- 
matic quality and pictorial appeal may 
well be thought of as promising something 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
    88 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
for the theatre audiences of the future, as 
well as for the writer and reader of stories 
and plays. The circumstances which de- 
termined the writing and the first produc- 
tion of Walter de la Mare’s “Crossings” 
should make other boys eager to read this 
play and to act it as soon as it becomes 
available. 
Those who have indifferent knowledge 
of boys and young men are often surprised 
that they care so much for beauty and ro- 
mance. Not so the story-teller, nor the 
writer of the books boys care most about. 
All sorts of vacuous impressions prevail 
concerning boys and girls of high school 
age, most of which can be replaced with 
finer and truer ones by forming a genuine 
friendship or two. “Barrie Marvell” is 
Charles Vince’s search through childhood, 
and he remains always a little boy hearing 
the night winds blowing and trying to get 
the smell of the sea in his far off garden. 
The chapter on ‘““Words and Words” is a 
perfect account of a child’s discovery that 
he could make words of his own. It is a

very nice book to read aloud and holds 
admirable child psychology. 
“Wizards and Enchanters’’ is the title 
of an absorbing chapter in Edmund L. 
Pearson’s “Books in Black or Red.” In 
it he pays tribute to “Davy and the Gob- 
lin,” and the other stories he still cherishes 
in St. Nicholas of the 1880's. The well 
chosen familiar illustrations in this book 
reinforce Mr. Pearson’s reminiscence. 
“A Century of Children’s Books” ends 
with the Edgeworths. Florence Barry be- 
gan the book before the war while a stu- 
dent in Sir Walter Raleigh’s class. Her 
appreciation of the subject in its relation 
to children and childhood is fresh and un- 
studied. The comment and the selections 
chosen for quotation are, in the main, ex- 
cellent. Such a book calls for pictorial 
accompaniment to stay the mind of the 
reader and the decorative cover jacket 
and more liberal margin to the page of

Winifred Bromhall’s illustrations and 
the attractive form of the new edition of

go NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
‘Walter de la Mare’s “A Child’s Day,” bid 
fair to place these charming verses directly 
in the hands of the children themselves. 
The photographs with which the earlier 
English edition was illustrated carried 
only a limited appeal, and as a result the 
book was hardly known at all in America. 
The new edition is an ideal birthday gift 
for a child of four, five or six years old. 
It is difficult to rest content with quoting 
these few lines from the verses: 
Softly, drowsily, 
Out of sleep 
Into the world again 
Ann’s ee aks 
And all that nny, song is meant to cay 
Is just what she did one long, long day 
With her own little self to play with only 
Yet never once felt the least bit lonely.

The verses in “Fifty New Poems for 
Children” have been carefully chosen from 
books recently published by Basil Black- 
well, and there is an index and bibliog- 
taphy of the authors — Robert Graves, 
Eleanor Farjeon, the Nightingales, and

child verses of E. Wyndham Tennant are 
to be found in it. After seeing the wood- 
cuts of Charles T. Nightingale which illus- 
trate Madeline Nightingale’s “Ring a 
Ring o’ Fairies” it seems a thousand pities 
to have used but one, and that on the outer 
cover of “Fifty New Poems,” where it 
will be quickly defaced. These delicate 
woodcuts are so much a part of the verses 
that they should be regarded as insepar- 
able from them. 
A new edition of “The Wind in the 
Willows” is said to have brought joy to 
Kenneth Grahame, since Nancy Barnhart’s 
pictures in color and line have caught the 
very spirit of his fantasy. That “The 
Talking Thrush,” a volume of East Indian 
stories, retold by W. H. D. Rouse and 
illustrated by W. H. Robinson, is again 
in print will be welcome news to story 
tellers.

S it worth while?’ asks a young 
mother, not long out of college, “to 
devote any time to the children’s books 
which are being published from year to 
year? The modern books all seem so 
much alike. Why not stick to the classics 
and standard authors for children?” 
“Because I neither want to miss for my- 
self nor do I want children to miss in books 
or in life a vivid sense of the present mo- 
ment,” is my invariable reply to such a 
question. It is too often forgotten that 
classics and standards were new books

once. There’s always a chance of discover- 
ing a new classic, since @:: for chil- 
dren is by no means finished. Any list of 
best books should hold spaces for the un- 
written books of the future. Some of us, 
watching the publishers’ output for a score 
and more of years, welcomed such authors 
as Kipling, Barrie, and Kate Douglas 
Wiggin, although we were not on hand to 
greet Hans Andersen, Lewis Carroll, Ed- 
ward Lear, and Mary Mapes Dodge. I 
have watched many good stories come to 
stay or come and go. I have seen the 
whole field of science, invention, games 
and sports, admirably covered with up-to- 
date, accurate, well written, and well 
illustrated books for boys and girls. Out- 
of-door books, the modern animal story, 
popular books about birds, insects, trees 
and flowers have all come into existence 
and general use within my memory. I am 
inclined, therefore, to be very hospitable 
to new books of all kinds, provided they 
can show credentials of authenticity, 
originality of conception or selection, and 
sound workmanship. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  94. NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
I always approach the fall output with 
a thrill of expectancy even when I begin 
to read from galley proofs in the summer 
and take my impressions of the make-up 
of the books from such publishers’ dum- 
mies as may be seen in advance. 
The most beautiful American book of 
1920 is “The Story of Jesus,” by Ethel 
Nathalie Dana. Mrs. Dana has made a 
rare selection of reproductions in color 
from the early Italian painters. The text 
of her book is taken directly from the New 
Testament and with the pictures was orig- 
inally arranged for the education and en- 
joyment of her own children, without 
thought of publication. Mrs. Dana, like 
many another mother, looked in vain for a 
book associating the Bible story with pic- 
tures which should carry its meaning and 
beauty to children. She reminds us in an 
admirable introduction to the book that 
“Jesus, Mary, and the Saints were intimate 
friends and helpers in medieval times and 
every one wanted to know the story of 
their lives. But in those days printing had 
not been invented, books were rare and
-P-A-G-E-93
SOME UNUSUAL BOOKS 95 
few could read. The best way, therefore, 
of telling these stories was to make a series 
of large pictures which could be seen at 
the same time by many. So the walls of 
the churches were like picture books.” 
Brief but effective notes concerning the 
lives of the artists who made these picture 
books—Giotto, Fra Angelico, Ghirlandaio, 
Duccio, Barnja da Siena and Gentile da 
Fabriano form a part of Mrs. Dana’s in- 
troduction. The book includes forty very 
beautiful color prints and its typography 
and make-up are in keeping with the sub- 
ject. Looked at as a single book its price 
may seem prohibitive to many parents and 
institutions. Regarded as a substitute for 
any one of a number of sets of books, cost- 
ing from ten to twenty dollars more, Mrs. 
Dana’s book fills a larger and more per- 
manent place in any home or library. 
“The Treasure of the Isle of Mist” is 
an exquisite fantasy of youth and autumn, 
“a fairy tale for my daughter,” says the 
author; and when one has read it one feels 
certain that Fiona, the long-legged crea- 
ture of fifteen with the warm heart and the
-P-A-G-E-94
96 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
“largish size in shoes,” is the veritable 
daughter of W. W. Tarn, who lives in the 
Highlands of Scotland. ‘To most people 
there is some corner of the earth which 
means more than all others,” and to Fiona 
is given the gift of the search for her own 
treasure—the spirit of the island she loves. 
“There are no short cuts to Fairyland,” 
she is told; and she does not reach the 
Fairy World till Hallowe’en, although the 
old hawker starts her off in September. 
“How shall I know where to begin? 
And may I take the Urchin with me?’ 
Fiona wants to know, like many another 
girl of fifteen. “Whether you can take the 
Urchin with you depends on his capacity 
to go,” says the old man. “And as to be- 
ginning I think you will find that the 
Search will begin itself, independently of 
you. It always does.” The Urchin (who 
is a real boy) goes along, but vanishes after 
exciting adventures in a haunted sea cave 
where he insists upon searching for his own 
treasure. “Carried off by the fairies,” 
Fiona tells her father, and straightway 
climbs old Heleval on the morning of
-P-A-G-E-95

October first to find a way of bringing him 
back. All the beauty of the autumn is in 
these descriptions of the Oread of the 
mountain-top, the King of the woodcock, 
and the fairy ring. As for the Fairy 
World—Fiona enters it at last and finds 
such a gathering as she had never dreamed 
of. “All the lost peoples and nations and 
languages were there in miniature; every 
one that Fiona had ever heard her father 
speak of and many another of which he 
knew nothing.” I am not surprised to learn 
that “The Treasure of the Isle of Mist” 
is the work of a distinguished scholar— 
an authority on the third century, B.C., 
and the author of a learned history pub- 
lished in 1913. “Hardly a writer for chil- 
dren,” I am reminded by someone who 
forgets about Charles Perrault, Lewis Car- 
roll, and the Grimms, and who has yet to 
make the acquaintance of Mr. Tarn’s 
“King’s Remembrancer—those two with 
the books.” “Why are there two?” Fiona 
asks the Leprachaun. ‘One to remember 
and one to forget, of course, stupid. Wher- 
ever were you educated? Do you think
-P-A-G-E-96
  98 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
kings want to remember everything?” “It 
must be very easy forgetting,” said Fiona. 
“Hardest job in Fairyland,” said the 
Leprachaun. 
Since ever and ever the world began 
They have danced like a ribbon of flame, 
They have sung their song through the cen- 
turies long 
And yet it is never the same. 
And though you be foolish or though you be 
wise, 
With hair of silver or gold, 
You could never be young as the fairies are, 
And never as old. 
It is Rose Fyleman who reminds us that 
“The Fairies Have Never a Penny to 
Spend.” Her charming verses ‘Yesterday 
in Oxford Street,” “White Magic,” “A 
Fairy Went a-Marketing,” which first ap- 
peared in Punch, are now collected under 
the fascinating title of ‘Fairies and 
Chimneys.” 
It is from the work of a distinguished 
oriental scholar, who has also the gift of 
telling stories, Professor Rhys Davids, 
that Marie Shedlock made her discriminat- 
ing and valuable selection of stories in 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
SOME UNUSUAL BOOKS 99 
“Eastern Stories and Legends.” The story 
of “The Hare That Ran Away,” which 
has been completely adapted and rewritten 
by Miss Shedlock, is often told by her in 
connection with Hans Andersen’s ‘‘Scan- 
dal in the Poultry Yard”—“‘the first story 
being simple and direct,” she says, “the 
second veiled in gentle satire.” Phrases 
out of “The Monkey and the Crocodile,” 
one of the most spirited and humorous of 
the stories of this collection, still lingered 
in my memory as I picked up the galley 
proofs of “The Story of Dr. Dolittle,’ the 
most delightful nonsense story of many 
years, with its delectable line drawings of 
Dr. Dolittle and his sister Sarah, the King 
of Polynesia and his son Prince Bumpo, 
the bridge of apes in the jungle, the leader 
of the lions, and all the rest. The author, 
Hugh Lofting, who is also the illustrator, 
must have first told the tale to pictures 
drawn for his own small boy. Dr. Dolittle 
gives up a practice among “the best peo- 
ple” of Puddleby-on-Marsh to become an 
animal doctor. His fame goes far and 
wide and he is sent for to cure an epidemic 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  100 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
among the monkeys of Africa. Of course, 
he had to go. Monkeys have such a lot 
of sense. “O silly Crocodile!” said the 
monkey of that remembered eastern story 
from the Pali, “you thought that there 
were creatures that kept their hearts hang- 
ing in a tree-top! . . . Your body is great 
but you have no sense.” (The Crocodile’s 
mate had wanted the monkey’s heart to 
eat.) Of the sense and gratitude of mon- 
keys you may learn from Dr. Dolittle, for 
whom they captured and to whom they 
gave that rare, shy, two-headed animal the 
pushmi-pullyu. Any father with a sense 
of nonsense and love of animal and hu- 
mankind will enjoy reading “Dr. Dolittle” 
aloud. I fancy it will be found as often 
in the hands of big boys and girls as little 
ones, since it is the real thing in the way 
of a “funny book.” 
The “Burgess Animal Book for Chil- 
dren” by Thornton Burgess is illustrated 
with colored plates by Louis Agassiz 
Fuertes. 
Of books relating to the Pilgrims, “‘The 
Argonauts of Faith” by Basil Mathews has

the best dramatic form and the most sug- 
gestive content for the story-teller, teacher, 
or librarian. Such chapter headings as 
“On the Great North Road,” “The House 
With the Green Door,” “The Ship of Ad- 
venture” are indicative of the romantic 
treatment of the author, who has held 
closely to historical records of facts. The 
book contains a foreword by Viscount 
Bryce, which relates to the Plymouth Pil- 
grims and the effect of their migration on 
England and America. 
“An Island Story” and “An Empire 
Story” by H. E. Marshall have been re- 
printed. Mary MacGregor’s “The Story 
of France” is also available; and the large 
print English editions of “Ivanhoe,” ‘The 
Talisman,” and Kenilworth’ are to be 
had once more from an American pub- 
lisher. 
N. C. Wyeth has illustrated “The 
Courtship of Miles Standish,” “Robinson 
Crusoe,” and ‘Westward Ho!” 
“The Shoemaker’s Apron” is a second 
volume of ‘“Czecho-Slovak Fairy Tales” 
by Parker Fillmore. Both its title and the  
-P-A-G-E-100

contents place this book more readily in 
the hands of a wide circle of readers. 
Of new stories for boys, I have read with 
interest “The Black Buccaneer,” by Ste- 
phen W. Meader. It is the story of a boy 
carried off the Maine coast by pirates in 
the year 1718, and gives promise of good 
work from a new author. 
James Willard Schultz’s “In the Great 
Apache Forest” adds another well-written 
story of Indian life to the list under his 
name. 
Edna Turpin’s “Treasure Mountain” is 
an adventure story for girls. I feel sure 
that girls will take from it genuine impres- 
sions of life in the Blue Ridge mountains. 
Eliza Orne White’s “The Strange Year” 
is a sequel to “The Blue Aunt.”

MAKING A LIBRARY 
One of the earliest books that captivated 
my fancy as a child was a collection of 
Robin Hood ballads “adorned with cuts? 
which I bought of an old Scotch pedlar at 
the cost of all my holiday money. How I 
devoured its pages and gazed upon its un- 
couth woodcuts . . . Robin Hood, Little 
John, Friar Tuck . . . were my heroes of 
romance.

N the Children’s Room of the great 
library which stands at the corner of 
Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street in 
New York City, you will find a fat little 
volume bound in faded red and gold, bear- 
ing on the fly-leaf this inscription:

The book is accounted one of the chief 
treasures of this children’s library, not be- 
cause of the authorship, although the wri- 
ter, Samuel G. Goodrich, was well known 
in his day for his tales from history and 
travel; nor yet for its contents, ‘Peter 
Parley’s Tales about Europe, Asia, Africa, 
and America,” which may amuse, but have 
long ceased to charm or inform the boy and 
girl readers: the little book is valued be- 
cause it held a place in a library made long 
ago in Scotland by the boy who was to 
write “Treasure Island,” “Kidnapped,” 
and “The Child’s Garden of Verses.” 
With some books there remain associa- 
tions of time and place and of other books, 
as well as of the personalities of their read- 
ers; the Stevenson “Peter Parley” is such 
a book. It belonged to Robert Louis Ste- 
venson from his sixth birthday, and many
-P-A-G-E-103

of its illustrations are crudely colored by 
his childish hand. It stood on the same 
shelf with his copy of ‘Robinson Crusoe,” 
and we know it was one of the books he 
carried to the South Sea Islands, for on 
the end-paper is pasted this label: 
From the Library of Robert Louis Stevenson 
At Vailima. 
‘When the Stevenson library of books and 
manuscripts was sold, his copy of “Peter 
Parley’s Tales” passed into the library of 
the children of New York. It seems to 
us, especially on his birthday, as if he 
might have placed it there himself as a 
perpetual reminder that books loved in 
childhood should go with us in our pil- 
grimage through the world. 
How often these books, or stories out of 
them, are carried only in half-memories. 
“Have you ever come upon a story called 
‘William, the Woodcutter’ ?”’ asked a Brit- 
ish naval commander visiting our chil- 
dren’s library just after the signing of the 
Armistice. “It is a story of wolves that I 
remember reading with great delight when

a lad, but I’ve never been able to find it 
since I grew up. I would give anything 
to read it now.” Rarely do we meet the 
man or woman who has kept intact the 
books of childhood and youth and given 
them their place in a library of mature 
years. If we hold it true that “authors 
are to their readers little new worlds to be 
explored,” how interesting it becomes to 
look back over the books we read and re- 
read and associate with our earliest birth- 
day and Christmas recollections! 
“The Christmas Tree,” of Dickens, 
David Copperfield “reading for life,” Jo 
March crying over the “Heir of Redclyfie” 
in a Concord garret, bring back memories 
of books to all of us. But what of the 
books themselves—those books which de- 
lighted us from the time we discovered that 
pictures could tell stories? Where are they 
and what were they? 
At a primitive mountain inn far up in 
the land of the Frost Giants I found, in 
the summer of 1912 a copy of “Little 
Lord Fauntleroy” in the Norwegian lan- 
guage. On the flyleaf was the name of
-P-A-G-E-105
MAKING A LIBRARY 107 
the proprietor, the only English-speaking 
person in the place. His boyhood had 
been spent in Minnesota, and he had read 
the story there in English. Coming in one 
day from a long tramp over the snow- 
fields, I picked up the book, and, as I began 
to read, sitting in the glow of that glorious 
sunshine, I seemed to be holding a much 
larger and a very friendly and familiar 
book, bound in red and black and gold, 
volume thirteen of St. Nicholas, in which 
I first read the story. Sz. Nécholas might 
well be called the forerunner of children’s 
libraries, since so many of the favorite 
books of boys and girls first appeared 
within its hospitable covers. In the chil- 
dren’s room of the public library in Chris- 
tiania I had already seen not only “Little 
Lord Fauntleroy,” but “Little Women,” 
“Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,” “Hans 
Brinker,” “Tom Sawyer,” and many an- 
other familiar title translated into the 
‘Norwegian language. 
No community library ever can or will 
take the place of a library formed by the 
boy or girl who has money to spend for
-P-A-G-E-106
108 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
books. And every boy and girl, by gift or 
by their earnings, should have money with 
which to buy books of their own and suit- 
able book-shelves on which to keep them. 
The training in judgment, discrimination, 
and sense of values acquired in making a 
thoughtful selection is of lasting benefit, 
and habits of careful handling and good 
arrangement of books can be formed in no 
other way. 
I would by no means advocate that boys 
and girls have no books given to them. 
That would mean cruelty to parents, to 
devoted uncles, aunts, and _ friends. 
Rather, I am inclined to urge the thought- 
ful giving of books the year round, instead 
of heaping them too high at Christmas and 
on birthdays. In my own experience, the 
unexpected gift of a well-timed book on 
Thanksgiving Day, St. Nicholas Eve (De- 
cember fifth), St. Valentine’s Day, May 
Day, or Hallowe’en has proved a great de- 
light. Biographies of Lincoln, Washing- 
ton, Grant, and Roosevelt may well be as- 
sociated with the birthdays of these great 
men; histories of America and of Euro-
-P-A-G-E-107
  MAKING A LIBRARY 109 
pean countries would often be more ac- 
ceptable if they were associated with the 
myths, legends, and folk-tales of the 
Northern, Southern, or Oriental countries. 
Books dealing with the sciences, inven- 
tions, handicraft, games, sports, and out- 
of-door life usually make a very definite 
and insistent appeal, and should be given 
when they are wanted rather than before 
or afterward. In determining the psycho- 
logical moment at which to give one book 
or another, the children’s room of the pub- 
lic library so constantly acts as a clearing- 
house not only for the boys and girls, their 
parents, teachers, and friends, but for the 
authors, artists, publishers, and booksell- 
ers, that I venture to suggest some general 
principles of book selection and purchase 
for the making of a library. 
I—Buy only those books of which you 
have first-hand knowledge and which are 
going to mean something to you at the time 
they are bought. Books should satisfy de- 
sires or supply needs. 
I—Considerations in the selection of 
books:

The Author. Has he or she the ability 
to write interestingly ? 
The Subject. What is the book about? 
Is it well written? If a book of informa- 
tion, is it accurate? If a story, is it orig- 
inal? Is this the best book on the subject 
for your library at this time? 
The Artist or Illustrator. Do the pic- 
tures add to the interest of the book? Has 
the artist interpreted the text? 
The Typography. Is the book printed 
in type that is easy to read? 
The Paper. The quality of paper used 
has very much to do with the legibility of 
the text, with the effect of the illustrations, 
and the general appearance of the book. 
The Binding. Is the book well put to- 
gether? 
If bound in more than one color, choose 
the color you like best. 
In the first volume of S¢. Nicholas 
(1873) there is an illustrated story called 
“Making a Library” that I have remem- 
bered from childhood. Little Charlotte, 
on a visit to her uncle, discovers that the 
books on the upper shelves of his library
-P-A-G-E-109
  MAKING A LIBRARY 111 
are not real ones. ‘“They were nothing but 
pasteboard boxes made like books and 
with the names printed in gold letters on 
the backs.” ‘“Charlotte’s uncle,” we are 
told, “was an uneducated man who had 
suddenly become rich. He wanted his 
house to have a fine library in it, but as 
he did not care for reading or for spending 
much money on books that would be of no 
use to him, he had these mock books made, 
and they looked just as well on the upper 
shelves as real ones.” One day when Char- 
lotte was playing house she determined to 
make a library of her own of these big 
books, which she could throw down so 
easily as she climbed from shelf to shelf. 
In passing the cradle where the baby was 
sleeping, Charlotte let several books slip 
from the great pile she was carrying. If 
they had been real books the baby would 
have been killed, the story runs, but they 
were all so light that the baby was un- 
harmed. The baby did wake up, however, 
and cried his loudest, to the undoing of 
Charlotte’s uncle. “It now became known
-P-A-G-E-110
  112 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
just what sort of a library Uncle Harry 
had.” 
The artist who illustrated the story 
added to the dramatic force of the situa- 
tion. He drew a little ‘girl who might be 
the great-aunt of Peter Newell’s child who 
feared “the Flowers—they are wild” car- 
rying a pile of books extending high above 
her head, from which several are falling 
about the cradle. 
I was old enough when I read the story 
to make immediate application of it, and I 
never failed to assure myself that the 
books were real in the libraries I visited. 
But there came a day when I learned that 
some books may be as great a sham as the 
pasteboard boxes of Charlotte’s uncle.

HE most invigorating, and I venture 
to predict, the most influential chil- 
dren’s book for many years to come is 
Hendrik Van Loon’s “Story of Mankind.” 
I shall leave his fellow historians to deal 
with any sins of omission or commission. 
But this I do know, that after many years 
of believing that universal history can be 
made a living thing to growing boys and 
girls and after many more years of looking 
and longing for real books to add to our 
libraries, a book is here that bids fair to 
revolutionize the writing and illustrating 
113 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  114 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
of history and biography for the fortunate 
youth of this generation and the next. 
Far and few may be the historians or 
the biographers who can make their own 
drawings and animated maps, but ideas 
have been liberated in “The Story of Man- 
kind” as well as in “Ancient Man” and 
these ideas are bound to multiply and bear 
fruit in the work of the artists as well as 
the writers of the next decade. 
I had the rare pleasure of introducing 
“The Story of Mankind” to a twelve year 
old boy in the midst of the ice storm which 
so cruelly wrecked many of the fine old 
trees in New England at Thanksgiving 
time. This boy had followed Wells a third 
of the way and expects to finish the book 
after reading Van Loon’s. He had just 
finished reading ‘‘Captain Scott’s Journal” 
and could talk of nothing else. As we fol- 
lowed the twelve year old Hendrik Van 
Loon to the top of the old tower in Rotter- 
dam, with the uncle who shared his love 
of books and pictures leading the way to 
his first glimpse of the great world, I real- 
ized how absolutely with the heart of a

boy and the brain of a man this book has 
been conceived, written, and illustrated. 
No boy is likely to skip a “foreword” that 
records an experience he can claim in im- 
agination as his very own, nor will he skip 
a chapter of the story which makes the 
world he lives in seem so spacious and so 
teeming with human interest from the days 
of primitive man, rollicking and philoso- 
phizing down through the Middle Ages 
and the Napoleonic era, to the invisible 
heroes of “A New World.” Before he fin- 
ishes the book he is almost certain to turn, 
as this boy did, to the reading list at the 
back to see how many books he has read 
already and which ones he would like to 
read next. 
This reading list is informed by an inti- 
mate personal knowledge of the books and 
a very true appreciation of the author’s 
plan and purpose. Leonore St. John Power 
made the selection and arrangement of 
books. Country libraries have great need 
of such a book to stimulate the reading of 
legends and stories with historical associa- 
tions.

The country library should by all means 
have a copy of the new edition of “The 
Scottish Chiefs.” Kate Douglas Wiggin’s 
spirited introduction supplies a charming 
touch of reminiscence and these strong 
words which have a bearing for translators 
as well as for editors of the classics: 
Neither of the editors believes in abridging 
the classics; still less in altering, interrupting, 
or adding to a text that should be sacred... 
not allowing a single romantic incident to escape 
us in a world that sometimes threatens to be 
dull, dreary and lacking in idealism. 
Nora Archibald Smith’s graphic and 
witty account of her own and her sister’s 
editorial work on “The Scottish Chiefs,” 
“Golden Numbers,” and other classics, 
was the event of the opening of a Holiday 
Exhibition for 1921. John Farrar’s read- 
ing to the same audience from his “Songs 
for Parents” was a happy introduction of 
a book already claimed by children. There 
has been no alteration of text in carrying 
out N. C. Wyeth’s long cherished idea of 
making a series of illustrations in color for 
“Rip Van Winkle.”

A new translation of Hans Andersen’s 
“Fairy Tales’ challenges comparison of 
text with proved versions. Those who are 
familiar with the best interpretations of 
Andersen’s philosophy and with renderings 
of his stories will look in vain for an essen- 
tial quality in Miss Toksvig’s work, the 
re-creation, in another language, of the 
spiritual atmosphere in which the story 
was conceived. It is not enough to trans- 
late the incident of the story nor is such 
phrasing as “step lively” and a score of 
similar terms calculated to bring an Amer- 
ican child nearer to the real Andersen. 
No, it isn’t done that way, nor by the kind 
of preface that Francis Hackett has 
written. Even with Parker Fillmore’s 
command of idiomatic English, I wish 
more time had been spent on “The 
Laughing Prince”’—a book of Jugoslav 
stories. His free rendering of “The Shoe- 
maker’s Apron” was better work and his 
introduction more in keeping with it. Jay 
Van Everen’s drawings are something 
more than a series of decorations. There 
is a very real imaginative quality in each

story as he has seen it and lived in it and 
one feels he has more in reserve. The 
make-up of this book is attractive and it 
should be of general interest. 
New translations of the tales of Per- 
rault, including two or three from Ma- 
dame d’Aulnoy, appear so often and in 
such indifferent form as to make very lit- 
tle impression on the reader. The distinc- 
tion of ‘Old-Time Stories’”—a very beau- 
tiful book—is given by the illustrations in 
color and in full page black and white 
drawings of great charm, provided by W. 
Heath Robinson—‘“Puss became a person- 
age of great importance” gives “Puss-in- 
Boots” a new place in the memory. “Fa- 
vourite French Fairy Tales” is a smaller 
volume in large type, containing the same 
stories retold from the French in more 
lively form by Barbara Douglas and illus- 
trated in color by R. Cramer. 
A spirited translation or re-rendering of 
the classics should be insisted upon by the 
artist on whom the success of a new book 
depends. Far too many good drawings 
have gone forth in company with inferior

texts. Readers in general are more critical 
of the work of editors and translators than 
they were ten years ago. There is daily 
evidence of this in the Central Children’s 
Room of the New York Public Library, to 
which all kinds of people come in steadily 
increasing numbers for comparison of texts 
and illustrations before making their own 
selection for purchase. Such evidence is 
confirmed by the practical experience of 
the Bookshop for Boys and Girls in Bos- 
ton, by the Children’s Bookshop in New 
York, the Hampshire Bookshop in North- 
ampton, Massachusetts, and by those gen- 
eral book-shops and book departments 
which have provided thoroughly informed 
service for the sale of children’s books. 
No phase of public work is so absolutely 
fascinating to me as this voluntary educa- 
tion of all sorts of people in country or in 
city communities concerning children’s 
books. Very early in my library experi- 
ence, I discovered that it was not possible 
to accomplish this by speaking from a 
library desk or an educational platform, 
without an outside point of contact with
-P-A-G-E-118
  120 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
the people who were making, selling, and 
buying the books we buy or do not buy for 
libraries. And so I began to visit publish- 
ers in midsummer and early autumn and 
to haunt the bookshops and book de- 
partments of department stores between 
Thanksgiving and Christmas, to the neg- 
lect of many other duties, but to the infi- 
nite delight and profit of the person the 
children began to speak of as “the lady 
who knows the books.” To keep that title 
in the active tense challenges one’s full 
powers of observation and absorption in a 
season when so many good books are ap- 
pearing. “It’s impossible to write the holi- 
day review without visiting the Boston 
publishers,” I said firmly to the editor of 
The Bookman. “TI had a very good time 
with Palmer Cox and Gelett Burgess and 
all the others on ‘Children’s Day of 
Bookman Week’ at the Wanamaker Audi- 
torium, and I enjoyed seeing Hector Mac- 
Quarrie’s surprise and delight over Ber- 
nard Sleigh’s ‘Ancient Mappe of Fairy- 
land,’ but I want to be surprised and de-

lighted myself by somebody or something 
in Boston.” 
My first surprise was in the nature of a 
shock when I found the ten year old sister 
of the boy to whom I carried “The Story 
of Ancient Man,” reading “Elsie Dins- 
more,” borrowed from the little friend 
with whom she had been dramatizing 
“Fairies and Chimneys” a few months 
ago. “Do you really like Elsie?’ I asked. 
“Nobody reads about her in New York. 
They just laugh at her and call her an in- 
sufferable prig.” The phrase insufferable 
prig captured her dramatic sense and she 
repeated it frequently during my visit. 
Next day I visited the Bookshop for Boys 
and Girls in the character of a bona fide 
aunt to buy the book I did not bring from 
New York, because I wanted to give her 
the fun of choosing it for herself. 
There was no hesitation in her mind. 
She laid a firm hand on Montrose Moses’s 
“Treasury of Plays for Children” and ap- 
parently lost all power or inclination to 
look at any other book. “I suppose it costs 
too much,” she remarked. ‘‘Mother said so 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  122 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
the day we came here to see Marshal Foch 
go by. We had to hurry and I got ‘Peggy 
in Her Blue Frock’ by the author of ‘The 
Blue Aunt’ and love it, but it isn’t long 
enough. This is such a ¢héck book and I 
love plays, and all their names sound so 
interesting.” 
Here was confirmation of my own rem- 
iniscent reaction to Mr. Moses’s altogether 
admirable book, as I reviewed it for the 
library. It is a book with which I should 
have been delighted between the ages of 
ten and perhaps fifteen. Notwithstanding, 
I deferred purchase for this particular 
child because I wanted her to discover 
other books for herself. She assisted in 
making a choice of books for a brother of 
six and a baby sister of three. “It has 
to be funny,” she stipulated. “She’s 
so funny inside.” Then she wandered 
away by herself into the fairy tale 
alcove of the fascinating new quarters 
of the Bookshop. Nearly an hour later 
she came back very hesitatingly with 
“The Princess and the Goblin.” “I wish 
TI could have this book—it has the loveliest
-P-A-G-E-121
HOLIDAY BOOKS 123 
pictures, but it costs more than the plays.” 
“Never mind the price if you are quite 
sure you will like it.” It was the beginning 
of the tragic ice storm, and after we had 
had tea we came back to the Bookshop and 
read poetry and selected more books to 
carry home to the other children. Next 
day I was housebound with the four chil- 
dren and I watched with a new thrill of 
admiration the power of George Mac- 
Donald to interpret and dramatize the 
spiritual experience of childhood. I didn’t 
offer to read the book aloud. This child 
manifestly preferred to read it alone, ex- 
pressing only her love of it and of the pic- 
tures Jessie Willcox Smith has made for 
it. To the boy of six I read Nancy 
Byrd Turner’s charming verses and stories 
in “Zodiac Town” from beginning to end. 
Then he brought out the books he likes 
best and we reread most of them, ending 
the day with “Russian Picture Tales,” 
“Uncle Remus,” Edward Lear, and 
Mother Goose. 
Then came two delightful days in the 
cozy offices and book-rooms of Boston pub-

lishers. Most of them are in houses, but 
LeRoy Phillips keeps his books in a stable 
—a stable with fireplaces, and brick walls 
with a strong reminder of London quar- 
ters. There I found Oliver Herford’s 
“Z7Esop,” rejoicing in a red Christmas 
jacket with a lion on it. At the Atlantic 
Monthly Press I was greeted by the orig- 
inal drawings which give such charm to 
Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer’s ‘Many 
Children,”’ a book of verse which is more 
of children than for them. Florence Wy- 
man Ivins, who made these lovely line 
drawings of children, which were recently 
exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum, 
made the decorative illustrations for a 
fascinating edition of “A Visit from St. 
Nicholas,” reprinted from the edition of 
1837. This Christmas poem was composed 
in New York’s Chelsea at Christmas time 
1822 by a man I’ve called from childhood 
Clement C(hristmas) Moore. 
I visited Little, Brown’s on Louisa Al- 
cott’s birthday and it struck me as a very 
happy coincidence that one of the books 
of the year from this house should be the
-P-A-G-E-123
  HOLIDAY BOOKS 125 
“Treasury of Plays.” At Houghton Mif- 
flin’s I had the happy inspiration of taking 
a load of books to review in the train. So 
I gathered up “The Puritan Twins,” which 
is remarkably human, John Martin’s 
“Children’s Munchausen,” illustrated by 
Gordon Ross, “Peggy in Her Blue Frock,” 
one of Eliza Orne White’s happiest stories 
for girls, and with these books and others 
to bridge the distance between Boston and 
New York the afternoon seemed hardly an 
hour long. I came back to find in my office 
that fascinating “Gargantua” extracted 
from Rabelais, and translated by Frederick 
S. Hoppin who has given a charming and 
entirely innocuous rendering of it. The 
full page pictures of Paris in color and the 
black and white drawings are by Adrien 
Leroy, a French artist, who was killed 
early in the War. 
There is a new edition of “The King of 
Treland’s Son,” which is, in my opinion, 
the most distinctive of Padraic Colum’s 
books for children. 
Two excellent annotated lists of chil- 
dren’s books suggested for purchase have

been published. One, compiled by Bertha 
Mahony of the Women’s Educational and 
Industrial Union, appears in its fourth edi- 
tion. The other, compiled by Jacqueline 
Overton and Marian Cutter, is printed for 
the first time. These two lists are very 
suggestive to the student as well as to the 
discriminating purchaser of children’s 
books.

CHAPTER NINE 
THE UNWRITTEN REVIEW 
Keep the young generations in hail and 
bequeath them no troubled hours. 
—GEORGE MEREDITH 
ON’T you give us something new 
and different in place of the old 
omnibus review? Make it purely fanciful 
if you like.” It was the editor of The 
Bookman who thus tempted me as we 
talked about a spring review of children’s 
books for the May number. My own in- 
tentions were then beyond reproach. It 
was early in January and I proposed to 
keep faith at all costs with the readers who 
had scrambled to the top of my ’bus or 
kept their seats inside since the fall of 
1918. 
“We must not disappoint readers who 
are depending on a general survey of chil- 
127 
   
-P-A-G-E-126
  128 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
dren’s books,” I repeated with the empha- 
sis of conviction and a certainty of accom- 
plishment. I had just returned from an 
inspiriting New Year’s visit to Maine and 
to the new offices of the Atlantic Monthly 
Press in Boston where I had discussed all 
sorts of stimulating ideas concerning chil- 
dren’s books, past and present, with Mr. 
Sedgwick, Mr. Howe, and the author of 
“The Firelight Fairy Book.’ I had also 
seen some fascinating illustrations for a 
new children’s book for which Ralph Ber- 
gengren was writing the story. There were 
other rumors of delights to come. In 
imagination I could already see advance 
galleys of books born of the impetus given 
to the spring publication of children’s 
books, by my review for May, 1920. To 
these forthcoming books I would add ap- 
praisals of holiday books received too late 
for the November review and of unusual 
books which had been given too little at- 
tention. Everything that anybody, in- 
cluding myself, might want to know about 
recent books for children should be con- 
tained in this review.
-P-A-G-E-127
THE UNWRITTEN REVIEW 129 
I honestly meant to write such a review, 
and if even one advance galley had come 
in I am sure I should have made a begin- 
ning. Not a single one appeared, and 
again I went a-journeying. This time to 
Pittsburgh and Cleveland accompanied by 
“An Ancient Mappe of Fairyland” sealed 
in blue and gold, Rose Fyleman’s “Fairies 
and Chimneys,’ Hugh Lofting’s “Doctor 
Dolittle,’ “The Firelight Fairy Book,” 
some fascinating old paperbound books for 
children sent over from London at Christ- 
mas by our Fairy Godmother—Marie 
Shedlock—and last, but not least, photo- 
graphs of the new libraries for French 
children established by the American Com- 
mittee for Devastated France. Perish all 
thought of an omnibus review in such com- 
pany and on such a pilgrimage in the year 
1921—the majority year of the children’s 
century. The approach to Pittsburgh, al- 
ways singularly dramatic, was made mem- 
orable to me this year by a marvelous sun- 
rise over the mountains. As the train sped 
on into the new day my thoughts went 
back to my first visit to the Training 
   
-P-A-G-E-128
130 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
School for children’s Librarians of the 
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. How 
vividly it all came back in a series of pic- 
tures of communities in which a children’s 
library, reading room, and story hour were 
then new, and fascinating experiences in 
everyday life. One of the graduates of 
the first class of children’s librarians 
(1902) is now directing the children’s 
library work in France. One of the stu- 
dents of the present class is a young 
French woman, a professor of history who 
expects to return to her own country to 
teach and to do library work. ‘The Chil- 
dren’s Library at Home and Abroad” be- 
came something more than a lecture title 
in the friendly atmosphere of this early 
stronghold of library work with children. 
By the time I reached Cleveland, an 
earlier and even stronger centre of influ- 
ence in the development of children’s 
reading and of the children’s library idea, 
the tide of reminiscence was carrying me 
back of my first experience of library com- 
mission work in Iowa to the year of my 
birth as a librarian (1896), when the
-P-A-G-E-129
THE UNWRITTEN REVIEW 131 
American Library Association met in 
Cleveland. The director of the Library 
School of Western Reserve University, 
Alice S. Tyler, is this year president of the 
American Library Association, but I shall 
always think of her as I first saw her in 
Iowa building a pontoon bridge across the 
chasm which so often separates our univer- 
sities from the popular educational insti- 
tutions of the state. Her early and strong 
championship of children’s reading and of 
the more personal methods by which it may 
be successfully carried on in the libraries 
and schools of the country, gave courage 
and freedom to an inexperienced lecturer 
whose chief concern then, as it is now, was 
to give literature the right of way with 
growing, changing, boys and girls. 
My second lecture at Western Reserve 
University—‘“Children’s Books: Past and 
Present”—did not bring me back, as I had 
thought it might, to the omnibus review. 
This road, like every other I had taken, 
led straight to France, to the old French 
fairy tales of the seventeenth century, the 
tales of Perrault and the Comtesse d’Aul- 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  132 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
noy—to the impetus given to the educa- 
tion of English and American children by 
the French writers who preceded and fol- 
lowed the French Revolution; to the sim- 
ilarities between our own time and that 
of the French Revolution; to our debt to 
the French authors and artists of children’s 
books—second only to that we owe to 
England. I read from “The Firelight 
Fairy Book” (whose author says that he 
has been more influenced by the French 
fairy tales than by any others) that de- 
lightful Franco-New England tale ‘‘The 
Seller of Dreams,” and Rose Fyleman’s 
“Yesterday in Oxford Street” and “Dif- 
ferences.” There is no recent book to com- 
pare with the verses of ‘Fairies and Chim- 
neys” for those who would play with both 
mind and spirit but have lost the magic 
touch. In its atmosphere more than one 
“fairy tree” has been planted by children 
in the Land of the Pilgrims and Puritans. 
I was invited one evening during my 
visit to see a colorful and remarkably well 
presented Pageant of the Book given by 
pupils of a junior high school at the Cleve-
-P-A-G-E-131
THE UNWRITTEN REVIEW 133 
land Art Museum. The text for this pa- 
geant has not yet appeared in print, but 
it deserves a place of its own to carry over 
the idea to other cities. It was distinctly 
a civic performance rather than a school 
exhibition. The modern book, as such, had 
no place in it, but the feeling for all that 
has gone into the making of books, the rich 
background of the guilds and crafts in- 
formed with human interest and associa- 
tion, was the more convincing because 
these book-loving boys and girls of an ele- 
mentary school had caught the spirit of 
the time in its relation to good workman- 
ship in any age. Still wondering over the 
simplicity and the beauty of a performance 
of school children in the Art Museum of 
their city, I began to read from Sir Arthur 
Quiller-Couch’s lectures to students of 
Cambridge University “On the Art of 
Reading”: 
I have often wished, Gentlemen, that some 
more winning name could be found for the 
thing we call Education, and I have sometimes 
thought wistfully that, had we made a better 
thing of it we should long ago have found a 
more amiable, a blither name. For after all it  
-P-A-G-E-132
  134 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
concerns the child; and is it quite an accident 
that weaning him away from lovely things that 
so lovelily call themselves “love,” “home,” 
“mother,” we can find no more alluring titles 
for the streets into which we entrap him than 
“Educational Facilities,’ “Local Examina- 
tions,” “Professors,” “Certificates,” “Diplomas,” 
“Elementary or Primary and Secondary Codes” ? 
« . . Take, even such words as should be per- 
ennially beautiful, by connotation—words such 
as “Academy,” “Museum.” 
But this lover of French fairy tales, of 
English poetry, of the legends of his own 
Cornish hills, reminds us that academy, 
museum, even education are sound words 
if only we would make the things corre- 
spond to their meanings. He defines once 
more the meaning of education as “‘a lead- 
ing-out, a drawing-forth’ of what is 
within a child. Speaking to university 
students and to all readers of his book, 
whether his subject is “Children’s Read- 
ing’’—to which he devotes two lectures of 
the twelve,—“The Value of Greek and 
Latin,” “On Reading the Bible,” or “Of 
Selection,” Arthur Quiller-Couch stands 
in the presence of childhood as a veritable 
part of life as he knows it, and states its  
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE UNWRITTEN REVIEW 135 
imperishable claim to literature. “All 
great literature,” he says, “is gentle toward 
that spirit which learns of it. It teaches 
by apprehension not by comprehension.” 
From the preface, dated July, 1920, two 
lines leap out in italics: “The real battle 
for English lies in the Elementary schools 
and in the training of Elementary teach- 
ers.” And the reason why this battle is 
worth hard fighting is given in a final lec- 
ture on “The Use of Masterpieces” : 
This War will leave us bound to Europe as 
we never have been: and whether we like it 
or not, no less inextricably bound to foe than 
to friend. Therefore, it has become important, 
and in a far higher degree than it ever was 
before the War, that our countrymen grow up 
with a sense of what I may call the soul of 
Europe. . . . Nowhere so well as in literature 
can they find this sense. 
It is as impossible to teach this as a sub- 
ject as it is to teach patriotism as a sub- 
ject in the schools of England (or Amer- 
ica). The only way it can be acquired is, 
by first of all gaining possession of the 
“master key”—the ability to read for one’s 
self—that ability to take a book apart and

let the author speak in his own way to a 
new reader and gradually to establish 
first-hand contact with great minds whose 
“speech has become memorable.” ‘There 
is no such thing as ‘mere literature,’ ” as- 
serts Quiller-Couch, and he as steadfastly 
refuses to disconnect national literature 
from national life as he refuses to treat 
the humanities as ‘“‘a mere crown and orna- 
ment of education; they should inform 
every part of it,’ he says, “from the be- 
ginning, in every school; and whether a 
child have more education or less educa- 
tion what he has can be and should be a 
‘liberal education.’ ” 
I wish Sir Arthur might have seen the 
Pageant of the Book at the Cleveland Art 
Museum. That he might listen to a tale 
told from one of his own books, “The 
Wandering Heath” or “The Splendid 
Spur,” at a Library Reading Club in New 
York. The very thought of reading as an 
art, of the readers who throng our schools 
and our libraries as potential artists, gives 
a lift and a promise to those who believe 
in the love of reading for its own sake.

‘, . And as new nations with ¢heir cities 
and villages, their fields, woods, moun- 
tains, and seashores, rise up into the moun- 
tain-side, lo! fresh troops, and still fresh 
troops, and yet again fresh troops of these 
school-going children of the dawn.” Years 
ago I had read that vision of children in 
William Canton’s “The Invisible Play- 
mate,” but it takes on new beauty and 
meaning set in the foreground of Quiller- 
Couch’s first lecture on “Children’s Read- 
ing.” I have marked a dozen pages for 
quotation and I can give but one, char- 
acteristic, as I think, of the charm, the 
humor, the deep understanding of child- 
hood and that attitude toward literature 
and the age to which it belongs which sets 
this book apart from all others which treat 
of children’s reading: 
There are no new fairy-tales of the days 
when your grandmothers wore crinolines—I 
know, for I have searched. Mothers and 
nurses taught the old ones; the Three Bears 
still found, one after another, that “somebody 
has been sleeping in my bed”; Fatima con- 
tinued to call, “Sister Anne, do you see any 
one coming?” the Wolf to show her teeth un-

der her nightcap and snarl out (O, great mo- 
ment!), “All the better to eat you with, my 
dear.” Those of our grandfathers and grand- 
mothers who understood joy and must have had 
fairies for ministers—those of our grandmothers 
who played croquet through a hoop with a bell 
and practiced Cupid’s own sport of archery, 
those of our grandfathers who wore jolly peg- 
top trousers and Dundreary whiskers, and built 
the Crystal Palace and drove to the Derby in 
green-veiled top-hats with Dutch dolls stuck 
about the brim—tot circa unum caput tumul- 
tuantes deos—and those splendid uncles who 
used to descend on the old school in a shower 
of gold—half-a-sovereign at the very least—all 
these should have trailed fairies with them in 
a cloud. But in practice the evangelical parent 
held the majority, put away all toys but Noah’s 
Ark on Sundays, and voted the fairies down. 
I know not who converted the parents. It 
may have been that benefactor of Europe, 
Hans Christian Andersen, born at Odense in 
Denmark, in April, 1805. He died, near Co- 
penhagen, in 1875, having by a few months 
outlived his seventieth birthday. I like to think 
that his genius, a continuing influence over a 
long generation, did more than anything else to 
convert the parents. 
At this very time Arthur Quiller-Couch 
was sharing his understanding of child- 
hood and his love of literature with Cam-

bridge University students, Rockwell Kent 
was sharing with his nine year old son an 
experience of life and of literature in rare 
accord with the principles established in 
“The Art of Reading.” ‘We live in many 
worlds, Rockwell and I,” he writes in his 
Alaska journal,—‘‘the world of the books 
we read,—an always changing one, ‘Rob- 
inson Crusoe,’ ‘Treasure Island,’ the vis- 
ionary World of William Blake, the Saga 
Age, ‘Water Babies,’ and the glorious Cel- 
tic past,—Rockwell’s own world of fancy, 
kingdom of beasts, the world he dreams 
about and draws,—and my created land 
of striding heroes and poor fate-bound 
men—teal as I have painted them or to me 
nothing is,—and then all round about our 
common, daily island-world itself more 
wonderful than we have half a notion of.” 
Fascinated at first by its drawings—‘The 
Snow Queen,” “The Sunrise,” “The Star- 
lighter” — the frontispiece — “Rockwell, 
Alaska MCMXVIII,” I paid no heed to 
the text, but as soon as I began to read I 
found I could not afford to skip one word 
of the journal lest I miss one of those sim-

  140 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
ple revelations of the mind and heart of 
the growing boy or his artist father. There 
is no trace of condescension in the relation- 
ship between Rockwell Kent the artist and 
his little son. Their six months of life to- 
gether in the white north, remote from all 
human companionship save that of Olsen, 
the old Swede, is just a dream come true 
_ to both of them. Dorothy Canfield has 
said in her introduction to ‘Wilderness’ : 
“The man who can extract the whole 
quaint savor out of that magical, prosaic, 
humorous moment of human life, the first 
stretching dawn of early morning, that 
man can make me believe that I too see the 
North Wind running mightily athwart 
the sky.” I question the appeal of this 
book to boys and girls but its value to those 
who would have a fuller understanding of 
childhood is beyond computation.

Dorothy Canfield writes from Vermont: 
“I have read through the report of the 
Libraries in the Aisne, with the deepest 
interest and delight, almost incredulous 
delight! I suppose to people who do not 
know French village life as I do, it can’t 
seem such a miracle to have a children’s 
reading-room, but it is a miracle none the 
less!’ What an element of sweetness and 
light in a French village, to have the chil- 
dren using a public library freely!”

CHAPTER TEN 
THE CHILDREN OF FRANCE 
Ils chantent comme le rossignol, parce 
quvils ont comme lui le coeur gai. Ils 
chantent une vieille chanson qu ont 
chantée leurs gran’méres quand elles 
étaient des petites filles et que chanteront 
un jour les enfants de leurs enfants; car 
les chansons sont de fréles immortelles, 
elles volent de lévre en lévre a travers les 
ages. 
—ANATOLE FRANCE. 
HILDREN are as vital to the land- 
scape of France as the birds, the 
trees, the flowers of her gardens and spring 
forests—the light of her sky. 
French poets and artists have been tell- 
ing us so for more than two hundred years 
—ever since Charles Perrault claimed the 
priceless right of the children of Paris to 
142  
-P-A-G-E-141
THE CHILDREN OF FRANCE 143 
continue to play in the gardens of their 
kings—even in that of the Tuileries in the 
reign of Louis XIV when Colbert sought 
to reserve it for the King and his Court. 
But it appears that every Anglo-Saxon 
must rediscover for himself this miracle of 
the continuing tradition of children and 
childish play in the everyday life of 
France which makes Paris, above all other 
cities, a children’s paradise. It was my 
good fortune to spend the months of April, 
May, and early June going back and forth 
to Paris, at intervals of a fortnight or 
more, from the ruined villages of the 
Aisne. 
Since I do not speak the French lan- 
guage I was more than ever grateful for 
Boutet de Monvel’s accurate pictorial in- 
terpretation of the daily life of French 
children in village and town. 
I could, and did, easily forego all other 
sights to spend hour after hour in the gar- 
dens of the Luxembourg and the Tuileries, 
along the Champs Elysées where the Gui- 
gnols are, at the Jardin des Plantes with 
the peacocks and the tigers, wherever chil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  144 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
dren were flying their kites, sailing their 
boats, spinning their big tops, rolling their 
hoops, riding fearlessly on ponies, ele- 
phants, camels, or calling gaily from little 
carts drawn by goats, or little carriages 
drawn by ostriches—there I followed to 
look and listen and feel my own childhood 
coming back by leaps and bounds. 
In a quiet stretch of the Bois de 
Boulogne I saw many a happy picnic en 
famille on Sundays and holidays. Wher- 
ever I went on a holiday—at the grave of 
the Unknown Soldier beneath the Arc de 
Triomphe, at Notre Dame, or thronging 
the Madeleine for their First Communion 
—the children were there before me in 
such numbers that I think of France now 
as a nation of children, with many wise 
parents, rather than as a nation of people 
with an “only child.” 
My hair-dresser was one of these wise 
parents and from him I learned more con- 
cerning the education of French children 
before the school age than I had ever 
known before. He was the father of a 
three year old boy who could already
-P-A-G-E-143
THE CHILDREN OF FRANCE 145 
speak English fluently. His mother had 
learned English while at a hair-dressing 
establishment in England. She had taught 
her husband to speak the language on her 
return to France, although neither of them 
expected to leave their own country, and 
the ultimate pinnacle of their ambition 
was to save enough to buy a little hair- 
dressing establishment by the seaside. 
Jean had been to the Spring Salon with 
his parents—they had not spent too long 
a time there, Jean would have been fa- 
tigué—he had liked two of the paintings 
very much. Jean would remember them 
perfectly, his father said. 
Jean was very fond of music and he was 
allowed to hear only the best. They had 
been fortunate in finding a small apart- 
ment high up in a great building with a 
beautiful outlook over Paris, which Jean 
would never forget. He already knew by 
name the buildings and statues he saw on 
his daily walks. 
“Does Jean care for the country?” I 
asked. 
“Oh, yes, Madame, Jean loves Nature. 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  146 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
We go always to the forest in Springtime 
and to the seaside in Summer. 
“To be sure Jean knows the names of 
the flowers and birds he sees. And he is 
very curious about the fishes and the shells 
at the seaside.” 
“Does Jean find any time to play?’ I 
asked at length. 
“Oh, Madame! Jean is always playing 
and singing and dancing. When he goes 
to school one day he must work for some 
hours. ‘ 
“He likes very much to see the Guignol 
on the Champs Elysées—Punch and Judy 
it is called in England—and Jean rides 
often upon the elephants at the Jardin des 
Plantes and drives a little goat sometimes. 
He is playing every day in the Luxem- 
bourg Gardens.” 
“Does Jean like fairy tales?’ 
“Mais oui, Madame, Jean likes most of 
all ‘Le Petit Chaperon Rouge’ (Little 
Red Riding Hood). 
“Does he fear the wolf, Madame? I 
do not understand—every child in France 
knows the old tale—it is very amusing and
-P-A-G-E-145
  
THE CHILDREN OF FRANCE 147 
lively and it asks have you courage? All 
children desire to be amused. Is it not so, 
Madame? 
“La Fontaine and M. Perrault under- 
stood very well that we must laugh some- 
times. Life would be too sad for a child 
if he did not learn early to laugh and to 
have courage in time of danger. We are 
often in danger. 
“Where there is courage there is no fear, 
Madame, and when a child laughs he is 
happy.” The father of Jean was not a member 
of any parents’ association nor was he a 
reader of books upon child training. He 
had neither time nor inclination for arti- 
ficial stimulation of his vivid interest in 
knowing Jean better and better every day. 
His hours at the hair-dressing establish- 
ment were long and he had only Sundays 
and holidays with Jean. 
But he, and others like him, gave the 
answer to my question: 
“Why are the French children so en- 
tirely unself-conscious and so charming?” 
It is because their fathers and mothers  
-P-A-G-E-146
  148 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
are by long inheritance unself-conscious 
students of child nature, who take time to 
live with their children and teach them by 
their companionship to enjoy life as they 
live it. 
As soon as a child learns to talk he be- 
gims to acquire naturally the art of in- 
formal conversation because his parents 
talk with him. There is no forcing or 
exploitation of this new personality. To 
know how to talk well is essential. It can 
be learned nowhere else than at home, 
and from learning to express himself well 
in spoken language he learns in due time 
that writing a letter is conversation too 
and he writes of the things he would nat- 
urally speak about. 
The antiquity of the French cradle songs 
of which Alice Meynell so delightfully 
reminds us in her essays “The Children” 
and “Childhood,” and I would say also 
the persistence of the familiar tradition of 
classic fable and tale in the purest form, 
give the French father and mother an easy 
and natural means of communication with
-P-A-G-E-147
  
THE CHILDREN OF FRANCE 149 
this new personality who is growing up in 
the family. 
Personality, individuality, is welcomed 
and given opportunity to express itself but 
not at the expense of courtesy and consid- 
eration for other people. The promise of 
unusual talent implies a corresponding 
obligation to work hard to make good use 
of it. Whatever a child learns to do he 
learns to do well, not as a means to a dis- 
tant end but as an end in itself. 
The question seems always to be not 
what business, what trade is my child go- 
ing to be fit for bye and bye, but what is 
there in him and how can I help him to 
express it here and now? 
From Paris I went first to one of the 
oldest towns in France and there in sight 
of its shattered cathedral, in a wooden 
baraque which stands on the ruins of its 
theater, I found children singing the old 
songs they have sung for centuries in every 
French village and town, singing softly as 
they turned the pages of one of the best 
loved books of the Bibliothéque de Sois- 
sons.  
-P-A-G-E-148
  150 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
My impressions of French country chil- 
dren are taken not alone from the libraries 
but also from many visits to village 
schools, to the homes in company with the 
nurses or the director of the centers, on 
long rides in camions with chauffeurs who 
knew the roads leading straight from the 
battlefields into the daily lives of the 
people. 
If no other equipment had been avail- 
able I am entirely convinced that the es- 
sentials of this demonstration of a popular 
library could have been administered from 
the tail end of one of these camions, which 
seem to me more marvelous than any Cin- 
derella coach. On my first visit I saw 
them loaded with every conceivable sup- 
ply—food, clothing, furniture, medicine 
for the sick, baskets for new babies. A 
few weeks ago I saw them loaded with 
happy-faced children, on their way from 
their temporary homes in shattered vil- 
lages to hear the Fée Marraine, Marie L. 
Shedlock, tell stories at Anizy, Coucy, 
Soissons, or Blerancourt. 
As I listened to the story of Pandora,  
-P-A-G-E-149
THE CHILDREN OF FRANCE 151 
more exquisite even in French than in the 
English rendering in which Miss Shedlock 
first gave it in an American children’s 
library more than twenty years ago, there 
came a strong sense of the creative power 
as well as the present happiness of a new 
generation of children whose childhood 
has been violated and of our obligation to 
sustain it spiritually as long as the need 
exists, for the sake of art as well as for 
humanity’s sake. We cannot afford to lose 
out of the world what these wonderful 
children of France have to give. 
The reality of what has already been 
done is revealed in such letters as this one 
written by a girl of thirteen living at 
Coucy-le-Chateau, in reply to letters of 
New York children: 
“Dear Little Friends: 
“I see that you do not forget the chil- 
dren of the devastated regions, and also 
that you love your American libraries very 
much. 
“Notwithstanding that ours is in a 
wooden baraque we think it very pretty. 
Its beautiful shelves full of books interest

us vividly and on Thursdays and Sundays 
we come to read them. We can also carry 
the books home and we spend the long 
winter evenings reading them in the fam- 
ily. Nowthat winter is approaching we 
love our library even better than in sum- 
mer, for the good fire attracts us also. 
“The library has many charms: on 
Thursday and Sunday we are told pretty 
stories and if they are translated into 
English you should read them also—‘The 
Blue Bird,’ ‘Prince Charming, ‘Tom 
Thumb.’ I could mention many other 
books which I have read but I should 
entirely fill the page and I must reserve 
part of it for other things even more 
useful. 
“In our geography lessons I have been 
much interested in your country, its situ- 
ation, its customs and in other ways. I 
have been given such a good account of 
your habits that I am happy to be able to 
say they play just as we do, they talk 
as we do, they read even as we do beautiful 
books.
-P-A-G-E-151
  
THE CHILDREN OF FRANCE 153 
“Across seas and oceans I embrace you 
affectionately, dear little ones of America.” 
The charm of these letters is broken by 
translation. I will give two others just as 
they were written by the children. Many 
of the letters contained pressed flowers 
and two boys sent drawings of their own 
village.

CHAPTER ELEVEN 
VISITS TO FRENCH AND ENGLISH 
PUBLISHERS 
HAD long been eager to visit French 
publishing houses—to put a living 
picture behind the imprint on each familiar 
title-page; but I shall have to confess that 
although I visited the length of the rue de 
la Seine, and round about, my pictures 
are all “still life’’ Not a single French 
publisher did I see and not a trace of the 
activities of publishing. Thanks to 
Madame Fischbacher, to M. le Texier of 
Brentano’s in Paris, and to other sources 
of information, I was able to verify and 
extend certain observations of my own. 
No new literature for children, poetry or 
prose, is known to be in the making. It is 
forty years and more since the strong group 
of writers to which Jules Verne belonged 
made its contribution to books for chil- 
162  
-P-A-G-E-161
  VISITS TO PUBLISHERS 163 
dren and young people. French girls are 
reading the stories of the Comtesse de 
Ségur and Madame de Pressensé as their 
great-grandmothers did before them. Not 
only is there a dearth of original work in 
the French language, there is a correspond- 
ing lack of spirited translations of English 
and American children’s stories. French 
publishers are republishing the children’s 
books which they had before the war, and 
are making no apparent resistance to the 
flood of old commercialized translations in 
new and attractive covers. These poor 
translations of mediocre English texts and 
the red and black and gold prize books 
stand in the way of the reprinting of many 
worthy books. The absence of informing 
lists of books for children and of any lit- 
erature on the subject of children’s reading 
renders more important and illuminating 
the free use of books in the libraries opened 
at Soissons and in the villages of the Aisne, 
at the municipal library in the rue Fessart, 
and at the American Library in Paris. 
In London I visited fifteen publishing 
houses and put living personages behind
-P-A-G-E-162
  164, NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
many names which have been household 
words since early childhood. I also dis- 
covered some new ones. 
While I found no very notable writing 
or illustrating of books for children going 
on in England at the time, I was delighted 
to learn that the picture books of Kate 
Greenaway and Leslie Brooke were being 
reprinted. At Bedford Court I saw, also, 
the advance sheets for a beautiful book 
of letters and sketches bearing the name 
of Kate Greenaway, the original drawings 
for Leslie Brooke’s new book of “Nursery 
Rhymes,” Francis Bedford’s for ‘The 
Magic Fishbone,” and some French trans- 
lations of Beatrix Potter’s “Peter Rabbit 
and Benjamin Bunny,” which are des- 
tined to be as popular in France as in 
England and America. 
I could secure no satisfactory informa- 
tion at John Lane’s in Vigo St. as to the 
future of Walter Crane’s picture books, 
many of which are out of print. From 
Philip Allan in Quality Court I learned 
that “The Treasure of the Isle of Mist’ is  
-P-A-G-E-163
VISITS TO PUBLISHERS 165 
the one and only children’s book W. W. 
Tarn is likely to write. 
Frank Sidgwick told me something of 
the history of the production of Bernard 
Sleigh’s “Mappe of Fairyland” and the 
difficulties in the way of proper display 
of it. 
With George Harrap and Jonathan 
Cape I discussed the well-worn theme of 
children’s books in series and the books 
which are too English for America or too 
American for England. 
I found myself extraordinarily inter- 
ested in the environment of each publisher. 
It acted as a kind of protective coloring, 
lending an air of mystery to everything he 
might have done or hope to do, which 
was not expressly stated in his printed 
catalogue. 
“Why should a librarian be interested 
in the publishing of books?” some one 
asked. 
“Because we are always seeing your 
books living or dying in the hands of ac- 
tual readers,” was my reply. 
John Murray was out of London, but a 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
166 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
very gracious letter from him led me to 
his historic office in Albemarle Street where 
I discussed with his son the possibliity of 
a new English edition of Marie Shedlock’s 
“The Art of the Story-teller,’” which had 
been repeatedly asked for in New York 
by educators from the British Colonies. 
My call upon T. Fisher Unwin in his 
beautiful office in Adelphi Terrace was one 
of the most delightful and suggestive of all 
my visits, and although I talked for but 
a very few moments with Sydney Pawling 
of Heinemann’s, I carry a strong remem- 
brance of a personality unsubmerged by 
the detail of business. I was not surprised 
to learn afterward that “The Velveteen 
Rabbit” was a special pet of his. 
St. John Adcock of The English Book- 
man confirmed my impression that no real 
criticism of children’s books, literary or 
humanized, was being printed in England. 
The holiday reviews are in the main re- 
statements of the publishers’ announce- 
ments. Mr. Adcock gave me courage to 
ask questions I had not dared ask any one 
else and suggested new points of inquiry.

I shall remain always in his debt for plac- 
ing his imagination as well as his time so 
generously at my disposal. 
George Grubb of Putnam’s in Bedford 
Street illuminated many points of dispar- 
ity between the publication and the dis- 
tribution of books on both sides of the 
Atlantic. 
On my return to New York, I learned 
from Ernest Eisele of Brentano’s, on whose 
admirable selection of European children’s 
books I have depended for many years, 
that while I had been gliding over the pol- 
ished surfaces of French publishing houses 
in Paris he had been further afield and had 
brought back genuine treasures from 
other countries, notably from Italy and 
Czechoslovakia.

  CHAPTER TWELVE 
RECENT ITALIAN CHILDREN’S 
BOOKS 
HE most notable of post-war Euro- 
pean books for children are coming 
from Italy. Two or three Italian pub- 
lishers are concerning themselves to an 
extent indicative of a new era in the pub- 
lication of children’s books. The mere 
cover design of one—a book of national 
songs—will furnish thirteen variations of 
Italian costume. The influence of Dulac 
and other illustrators is to be seen, but 
these Italian artists are bringing to their 
illumination of national and popular songs 
and stories, qualities of childlike imagina- 
tion, humor, and a freedom from artistic 
self-consciousness, most stimulating to 
artists of other countries. 
The attitude of the compiler or author 
of the text is no less refreshing. “Children

of Italy,” runs the brief dedication to 
“Cantilene Popolari,” ‘future defenders 
of the rights and honor of our nation, to 
you we entrust this little treasure which 
we have hunted out with patient love and 
intense joy. Guard it tenderly as if it 
were a fragment of our sacred flag; love it 
as you would love a fragrant flower out of 
an enchanted garden and let your little 
comrades repeat with you the easy rhymes 
of the old children’s games of our land— 
games which your fathers and grandfathers 
and their ancestors played thousands of 
times and which are a living symbol of 
Italianity.” The songs of this very beau- 
tiful collection appear in each instance in 
the language of the province from which 
the song has been taken, followed by a 
version in idiomatic Italian. The songs 
were transcribed and harmonized by Elisa- 
betta Oddone. Marco Montedoro’s illus- 
trations are in color. The book is pub- 
lished by the Istituto Italiano d’ Arti 
Grafiche.

tures by Corrado Sarri, published by Luigi 
Pampaloni. As an Italian picture book for 
little children it seems to me quite as rep- 
resentative as “Pinocchio” asa story. The 
pictures are so full of the detail children 
love as to tell their own story to children 
of any race. The artist has the gift of a 
modern unsophisticated touch in an old 
world atmosphere. It is bound in boards 
covered with a flowered Italian paper. 
Their publishers deserve special thanks 
for giving us such admirable examples of 
children’s book making at this time. 
“A Voi Bimbi” (To You Children) is

CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
THE CREATIVE SPIRIT IN 
AMERICA 
Oh what land is the land of dreams? 
What are its mountains and what are its 
streams? 
—WILLIAM BLAKE 
RIGINALITY, personality, and va- 
riety in form distinguish so many of 
the books of the year 1923 as to indicate 
that authors, artists, and publishers are 
all seeking escape from the commonplace 
and the attenuated both in new titles and 
in new editions of old favorites. 
Back to the Alphabet with Charles B. 
Falls is an excellent rallying point and we 
may well feel proud that an A B C book 
so admirable in design and in color print- 
ing has been produced on this side of the 
Atlantic. Mr. Falls designed the book for 
173
-P-A-G-E-172
  174, NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
his little three year old daughter who 
likes ‘a big book with lots of pictures.” 
The drawings are cut on wood blocks and 
printed from four-color plates and the 
artist personally superintended the repro- 
duction of them. The highly decorative 
treatment accorded this group of animals 
and birds, freshly chosen from Zoo and 
farm yard, has robbed no one of them of 
lifelike quality because of the simplicity 
and strength of line. The text is wisely 
limited to E is for Elephant, F is for Fox. 
The imagination of a child or grown-up is 
left free to capture by its own thrill of 
recognition the familiar in a new-old me- 
dium where color has not obscured the out- 
line nor played too many tricks with 
Nature. 
The book will take its own place in the 
art departments of schools and libraries, 
but the fact that it was designed for a liv- 
ing child for whose mentality the artist 
had such evident respect stamps it first 
of all as a children’s book which bids fair 
to exert a very considerable influence on 
American picture books.
-P-A-G-E-173
  
CREATIVE SPIRIT IN AMERICA 175 
It is high time we set about in earnest 
the production of American picture books 
of original character in distinctive form. 
Our own country needs them and other 
countries might even come to enjoy them 
as they now enjoy the best of our chil- 
dren’s stories. 
Their creatjve influence upon the illus- 
tration and the writing of children’s books 
in general is bound to be felt if they are 
strong enough in original conception and 
are reproduced in accordance with authen- 
tic artistic standards. 
To make them good enough calls for 
genius, a rich background, and a fresh 
outlook on the part of the artist—faith 
and determination to set new standards for 
reproduction on the part of the publisher. 
A notable instance of such faith and 
willingness in England led to an exact 
reproduction of William Nicholson’s litho- 
graphs for “The Velveteen Rabbit.” 
Mr. Nicholson led the revival of print- 
ing from wood blocks about twenty-five 
years ago with “An Alphabet,” ‘The 
Square Book of Animals,” “An Almanac 
   
-P-A-G-E-174
176 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
of Sports” and his character portraits— 
historical and legendary, notably his por- 
trait of Queen Victoria. While none of 
his earlier work was done for children, the 
portraits were always, in my own experi- 
ence, of great interest to boys and girls. 
“Nursery Rhymes,” with unforgettable 
drawings in black and white and color, by 
Lovat Fraser, is another outstanding in- 
stance. It is the most widely and deserv- 
edly popular picture book that has been 
added to public library collections in many 
years. There is a book after everyone’s 
heart for the Christmas holidays this year, 
and I have amused myself by setting up 
a series of imaginary exhibitions of chil- 
dren’s books extending from Maine to 
California, from Florida to Canada, as I 
have studied the new catalogues of the 
publishers or turned the leaves of dummies 
and advance copies of new books. 
I should start every such exhibition with 
The All Mother Goose Panorama, which 
is not a book at all, but a wall decoration 
for a child’s own room, a school room, or 
alibrary. Luxor Price designed this pano-
-P-A-G-E-175
  
CREATIVE SPIRIT IN AMERICA 177, 
rama in collaboration with his little boy 
who is four years old and who told him 
just where to place everything. The work 
was a commission for another little boy’s 
room and the child who gave it both charm 
and character missed it so much that it was 
first photographed and then reproduced 
in color under Mr. Price’s direction. 
Nothing at all like it has appeared within 
my remembrance, and since it is perhaps 
the most unusual piece of reproduction in 
color yet attempted in this country the out- 
come is awaited with interest. 
Kay Nielsen’s illustrations for “East of 
the Sun and West of the Moon” were last 
year brought within reach of many libra- 
ries and schools by the publication of a 
cheaper edition. This book of old tales 
from the North or “The Twelve Dancing 
Princesses,” a book of well known and less 
known fairy tales retold by Sir Arthur 
Quiller-Couch and illustrated by Kay 
Nielsen lend color and interest to any 
exhibition. 
Dulac’s illustrations for Lawrence 
Housman’s “Stories from The Arabian
-P-A-G-E-176
178 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
Nights,” Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch’s ren- 
dering of “The Sleeping Beauty and Other 
Tales from the Old French” and “Stories 
from Hans Andersen,” also appear in 
cheaper editions. Arthur Rackham’s illus- 
trations for “Grimm’s Fairy Tales,” and a 
new edition of “The Fairy Book,” the tales 
in which were selected by Edmund Gosse, 
appear in new editions with the imprint of 
new publishers. It should be realized and 
remembered that the work of these more 
sophisticated artists is not designed nor 
should it be recommended for children of 
picture book age. 
For older boys and girls and for all 
grown people with any love of art, they 
renew and extend the early charm of fa- 
miliar tales and keep them in sight and 
in mind through a stretch of adolescence 
and middle-age that was colorless before 
they came. 
The English version of the Queen of 
Roumania’s “Naughty Kildene” with its 
lovely illustrations in color by Job is for 
the unusual child and her parents. It is a 
very clever, lively, and sophisticated story 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
CREATIVE SPIRIT IN AMERICA 179 
with an unmistakable moral. The book 
was first published in French and I am 
told that many American parents objected 
to the eagles in both pictures and story as 
“too frightening” for young children. So 
frequently has a similar objection been 
urged concerning the drawings of Arthur 
Rackham and other artists, that I would 
like to urge an even greater danger—that 
of the commonplace both in illustration 
and in text. 
The remedy lies, I think, not in going 
without the book, but in looking deeper 
and further and choosing the right time 
and the right person for the presentation 
of it. Many children see ghosts and gob- 
lins and all kinds of things up to about 
seven years old and then usually the illu- 
sions pass away. The artist retains this 
power. 
Quiller-Couch has well said that if we 
limit children of the next generation to 
what we admire ourselves we pauperize 
their minds and this is no less true in the 
field of art than in that of literature. 
I may remind the reader that I place the
-P-A-G-E-178
  
180 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
most liberal construction possible upon the 
term children and include all ages falling 
there under the law. By his refusal to be 
tagged or too definitely prescribed for in 
life, in story, or in picture, the ageless 
child remains always in our midst to prove 
the exception to every list of books ever 
made for his benefit. 
“This Singing World” sounds a new 
and refreshing note in anthologies for 
children. Louis Untermeyer’s plan for the 
book is his own and is based upon creative 
ideas. He states it clearly in his intro- 
duction—which is a direct and very sim- 
ple appeal to the reader to read wherever 
it pleases him in the book—and he affirms 
it in the titles he gives to the various 
sections. 
Mr. Untermeyer has not made a book to 
please himself as poet and critic, nor has 
he brought together a miscellaneous col- 
lection of poetry and verse from other 
anthologies. He has gone straight to the 
field of modern poetry and verse with 
which he is thoroughly familiar—‘‘Most 
of the poems in this book were written by
-P-A-G-E-179
  CREATIVE SPIRIT IN AMERICA 181 
living poets’—and has made a liberal se- 
lection (the book includes about 350 titles), 
with allowance for the widely differing 
tastes of many readers concerning which 
he has taken the trouble to inform himself 
—“and so” he is able to say with truth, 
“ft is ¢hés singing world—your world as 
well as theirs (the poets) that is between 
these covers.”’ Such a live anthology with 
direct appeal to older boys and girls has 
long been needed in library reading-rooms. 
and school libraries, and Florence Wyman 
Ivins’s drawings, while turning it into a 
gift book of genuine value, have not 
blinded the publishers to the necessity of 
giving it a durable but very attractive out- 
ward form. 
Winifred Bromhall’s pictures for “A 
Child’s Day” while in no way remarkable 
are very childlike and true and are intro- 
ducing hundreds of children and their 
parents to the poetry of Walter de la 
Mare. 
Those who liked Carl Sandburg’s 
“Rootabaga Stories’ and found in them 
something new and different than we have 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
    
182 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
had in any book before, will go further 
and find still more in ‘Rootabaga 
Pigeons.”’ Most of the stories in the second 
book were written before the first volume 
was published. As a matter of fact, Carl 
Sandburg, who is the father of two little 
girls and an older one, has been writing 
these stories for some years, storing them 
away in a household crock of gold, which 
I trust will never be entirely empty, al- 
though I am told there will not be another 
volume of Rootabaga stories. 
Those who did not like the first book 
will do well to read the second before 
forming a final opinion as to the value of 
Carl Sandburg’s contribution to American 
children’s books. I feel sure that a defini- 
tive volume from the two books will 
eventually be made by the author, since 
the stories are unequal in content and form 
and some of them were manifestly not 
written for children. But for that matter, 
few of the books written directly for 
children survive a generation of readers 
and critics. Such stories as “Slipfoot,” 
“Pig Wisps,” “Deep Red Roses,” the “Six
-P-A-G-E-181
  
CREATIVE SPIRIT IN AMERICA 183 
Pigeons who sent the Telegrams” and 
others—whether nonsense or beauty is 
their theme—are bound to live because 
they are works of art—‘‘a work of art can 
walk again” Hans Andersen tells us in 
his story of that marvelous clock—the 
clock that marched up the church aisle at 
a wedding and planted itself between 
bride and bridegroom after it had been 
smashed with an ax by the man who sought 
to do “the most incredible thing” in order 
to win the Princess for his bride—‘the 
spirit of the work walked and that in 
deadly earnest.” The spirit of genuine 
creative work will always walk in America 
no less surely than in distant and older 
countries. 
There is very much of the same spirit 
that lies behind Rose Fyleman’s verses, 
as well as of that she has caught from 
John Farrar’s charming plays, in the illus- 
trations Mary M. Ludlum has made for 
“The Magic Sea Shell.’ They are her 
own interpretations of the seven original 
plays which make up this book rather than 
mere pictures for it. Mr. Farrar has I be-
-P-A-G-E-182
184, NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
lieve “started something” in play litera- 
ture for children which has been sadly in 
need of a creative touch. The appeal to 
the imagination is in these little masques 
which are written to be given in garden, 
field, or meadow, or indoors without for- 
mal preparation, and the book’s essential 
atmosphere is “It’s such fun to give a 
play!” 
In “The Starlight Wonder Book” 
Henry B. Beston has dipped his pen in a 
well of pure English to write another book 
of his romantic out-of-door tales. I heard 
him read “The Man of the Wild Wood” 
and “The Brave Grenadiers” in the woods 
at Peterborough a year ago and they 
seemed to me even better than the stories 
of “The Firelight Fairy Book.” Such 
titles as “The Bell of the Earth and the 
Bell of the Sea” and “The Wood Beyond 
the World” suggest that the stories are of 
the type of “The City Under the Sea” of 
the earlier volume. 
“A Traveler's Letters to Boys and 
Girls’ is gay without and pure gold 
within. Caroline M. Hewins, who wrote
-P-A-G-E-183
CREATIVE SPIRIT IN AMERICA 185 
these letters from Florence, from London, 
from Edinburgh, from Algiers, to actual 
boys and girls with whom she wanted to 
share the pleasure of her own holiday, is a 
born traveler with a true love of art and a 
sure knowledge of literary and historical 
associations. Miss Hewins has made a 
distinctive contribution to an undeveloped 
field of children’s books and her publishers 
have wisely refrained from disguising the 
book under a made-up title. The illustra- 
tions have been carefully chosen to rein- 
force the text and the decorative map and 
gay end papers make it a most attractive 
book for a prospective traveler. 
“The Wizard of the North” is an ad- 
mirable piece of work, the strongest of 
Parker Fillmore’s free renderings of folk 
literature, in my judgment. Jay Van 
Everen has made the drawings for these 
stories from the Kalevala, which abound 
in pictorial suggestion. Mr. Van Everen’s 
pictures for “Nicholas, A Manhattan 
Christmas Story” are entirely different 
from any other work he has done since the 
subject called for action, simplicity, and
-P-A-G-E-184
  186 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
a rediscovery of actual New York as well 
as for pictorial imagination. His colored 
frontispiece carries the very spirit and 
essence of Christmas in a new way and 
his pictorial map of Manhattan, which ap- 
pears as end papers to the book, and also 
in a separate wrapper, is unique. 
The full page drawings and the head 
and tail pieces for the book are authentic 
in their representation of things actual and 
historic and amusing in the portrayal of 
the imaginative. The story is a true story 
of Nicholas, a strange Dutch boy, written 
for the ageless child living anywhere. 
Nicholas is of the race of Knickerbockers 
and sheds a bright light on Washington 
Irving’s relation to children. His pub- 
lishers have given him the best of typog- 
raphy and distinctive form. 
“‘Franconic Stories,” edited by Margaret 
Armstrong, sent me straight to the ten 
little red volumes as Jacob Abbott wrote 
them in the 1850’s to find that Miss Arm- 
strong had treated her text with respect 
and genuine affection. The first three 
chapters of her book are taken from
-P-A-G-E-185
CREATIVE SPIRIT IN AMERICA 187 
“Malleville’ and the remaining chapters 
are from “Wallace” and other volumes of 
this fascinating series. While I can ill 
spare some of the charming bits Miss Arm- 
strong has eliminated from her text,—not 
a word the inimitable Beechnut said should 
ever be lost nor a single explicit direction 
of Jacob Abbott himself,—I welcome a 
new and attractive form of the stories for 
the children of today. 
Whether the children of today read the 
stories or not the re-presentation of them 
is both a reminder and a challenge to the 
writer of children’s stories that there is 
much to learn from the American pioneer 
in the field. Jacob Abbott began to write 
his children’s books to miscellaneous en- 
gravings for the Harpers in 1837, yet he 
did not turn into a hack writer. Rollo, 
although dominating a long series, was 
never a lay figure. He was a personality 
from the day he learned to talk to the last 
of his travels. To be sure it is only once 
recorded that “Rollo laughed long and 
loud.” He had no sense of nonsense, yet 
Rollo was a real character at a period
-P-A-G-E-186
  188 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
when wax works of high moral principles 
were being shown all over the land in the 
guise of impossible Sunday school book 
characters of the 1840’s whose names have 
passed into oblivion or ignominy. 
But it is Beechnut, the French boy who 
comes over the White Mountains from 
Canada on foot, carrying his bag of gold 
and his picture of Paris who is invested 
with Jacob Abbott’s true creative fancy 
and dramatic power of historical associa- 
tion. Beechnut might have lived in a 
Beadle Dime novel of the late fifties and 
sixties, for he is vivid, adventurous, and re- 
sourceful, even in a domestic environment. 
The spell of repression and prohibition 
was lifted now and then from American 
authors of children’s books as the influence 
of European folk literature began to be 
felt, but it was not broken until Mary 
Mapes Dodge wrote her “Hans Brinker,” 
which was published in 1865, the same 
year as “Alice in Wonderland.” 
Eight years later, when she became the 
first editor of Sz. Nicholas, she made her 
declaration of freedom: “A children’s
-P-A-G-E-187
CREATIVE SPIRIT IN AMERICA 189 
magazine should be their playground.” In 
that spirit Mrs. Dodge wrote for Sz. 
Nicholas herself and with a touch of magic 
that was all her own she induced many 
well known authors to write for it, holding 
each of them strictly to account for his 
performance in the interest of children— 
the best was none too good—yet giving a 
hearty welcome to genuine nonsense and 
to all fresh fields of creative writing. Kip- 
ling’s “Rikki-tikki” and ‘Little Toomai 
of the Elephants” first appeared in St. 
Nicholas. 
The best of American stories for boys 
and girls of the nineteenth century were 
born of the incentive and encouragement 
given by Mrs. Dodge and Frank Stockton, 
who was associated with her as editor of 
St. Nicholas. 
This year marks the passing of a half 
century since the founding of Sz. Nicholas, 
and as I write these words, over the cable 
comes the sad news of the death of Kate 
Douglas Wiggin in England. 
It is not too soon for one who knew her 
well and who has lived in intimate asso- 
   
-P-A-G-E-188
  190 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
fi 
ciation with two generations of children 
from all nations who have loved both her 
books and her vivid personality to give 
“Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm” and “The 
Birds’ Christmas Carol” a high place in 
American creative writing for children. 
Kate Douglas Wiggin will live in the 
hearts of children to come by virtue of all 
that is timeless in the quality of her dra- 
matic art, and she leaves no successor in 
her field. The creative spirit pervaded 
everything that Kate Douglas Wiggin 
touched. Even the anthologies—‘‘Golden ; 
Numbers” and ‘““The Posy Ring,”’ the col- 
lections of fairy and folk tales, “Tales of 
Wonder’ and “Tales of Laughter,” 
“Magic Casements,” “The Fairy Ring”— 
which she made in collaboration with her 
sister, Nora Archibald Smith, were chosen 
and named out of the fullness of her own 
strong romantic association with the 
things in literature she loved and wanted 
to share. 
The true art of the story-teller, the in- 
tegrity of a fine critical judgment, were 
behind this work, but there was more—
-P-A-G-E-189
CREATIVE SPIRIT IN AMERICA 191 
the suré touch of one whose deep human 
interest in all children was founded upon 
a bedrock of practical experience and il- 
luminated by a vision of their future. 
William Blake was the first to see chil- 
dren, to feel childhood, and to so illumin- 
ate the record of what he saw and felt as 
to give children a place in the world they 
had never held before. ' 
And it is to heer place—to the wide- 
open fearless eyes, to the readiness for 
fresh adventure, to the gay, laughter of 
children who are allowed to take the read- 
ing of books as naturally as they turn to 
the light of the sun, the moon, and the 
stars, that the poet must ultimately come 
for judgment of his song, the artist of his 
picture, the story writer of his story. Chil- 
dren are the truest of all critics when they 
are free to speak their minds -in simple 
terms. ; 
It is the impertinent “Why?” or the 
irrelevant comment of the unimaginative 
parent or teacher that seals the lips of 
many children and sends others, like the 
little hero of Wordsworth’s “Anecdote for
-P-A-G-E-190
  192 NEW ROADS TO CHILDHOOD 
Fathers,” in hot pursuit of weather cocks 
wherever they may be found. 
William Blake remained all his life in 
the visionary state of childhood. It was 
Wordsworth who left the record not only 
of visionary children, and of childhood 
as a remembered part of life, but of his 
personal debt to that living boy “of five 
years old” with whom he walked at Liswyn 
Farm. | : 
It is the most human touch in all Words- 
worth and it rises like a golden milestone 
at the beginning of the long road of com- 
munication with English speaking children 
that crosses and recrosses the Atlantic.

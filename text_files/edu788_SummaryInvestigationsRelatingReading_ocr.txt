PREFACE 
The summary contained in this monograph was made possible by a 
subvention from the Commonwealth Fund. The preparation of the report 
was a part of the work assigned to the subcommittee appointed by the 
Research Committee of the Commonwealth Fund, which was charged 
with the duty of inquiring into the possibilities of reorganizing the 
administrative units of the American school system. This subcommittee 
undertook to collect and summarize the scientific studies in arithmetic 
and reading. The present monograph is a summary of reading investiga- 
tions. An earlier monograph summarized the studies in the field of 
arithmetic.

CHAPTER I 
THE PROBLEM 
Purpose.—The purpose of this monograph is to summarize for the use 
of teachers, supervisors, and investigators the results of scientific studies 
relating to the problems of reading instruction. Such a report should 
provide school officers and teachers with the facts and principles which 
must be considered in any serious effort to reorganize courses of study in 
reading or to improve the technique of teaching. In addition, it should 
indicate the extent to which progress has been made in the scientific 
study of reading and should suggest additional problems for investigation. 
Sources of material—The materials on which this summary is based 
are the published reports of most of the reading investigations made in 
America and England prior to July, 1924. Reference is also made at times 
to studies carried on in Germany and France that contribute to a clear 
understanding of the problems under discussion. Unfortunately, it was 
impossible to secure copies of all the studies to which reference was found 
in a preliminary survey of the field. For example, a large number of 
magazines and bulletins which contain suggestive titles are out of print. 
Method.—A word of explanation is included concerning the procedure 
followed in the preparation of this monograph. As reports of investiga- 
tions were secured, they were read carefully for the purpose of determining 
whether they contained valid conclusions or facts which could be used 
in the summary. A list was also made of the specific problem or problems 
which were studied. These statements, together with the appropriate 
bibliographical references, were then classified and filed. Finally, a sum- 
mary was prepared of the facts and conclusions concerning various im- 
portant problems of reading instruction. On account of the limitations of 
space, fewer critical discussions of the technique used in the various stud- 
ies are included than was originally planned. 
Organization of report-—The chapter which follows presents a brief 
historical sketch of the development of scientific interest in reading in 
Europe and America. It also presents a bird’s-eye view of the problems 
that have been studied and describes the tendencies that have developed 
as investigation has gone forward. The remainder of the monograph 
summarizes the results of investigations that relate to fifteen major 
problems or phases of reading instruction.

CHAPTER IL 
HISTORICAL SKETCH OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS 
OF READING 
Introductory statement.—The scientific study of reading problems 
began in the laboratories of Europe about the middle of the nineteenth 
century. The motive for these studies was the interest in the psycho- 
logical processes involved in reading. Prior to 1900 most of the investiga- 
tions were made in Germany and France. Since that date scientific inter- 
“est in reading has increased so rapidly in this country that the United 
States now surpasses all other countries in productive work in this field. 
In’ the brief historical sketch that follows, the developments in 
Germany and France will be summarized as a unit because the studies 
made in these countries were carried on contemporaneously and related 
to essentially the same problems. The investigations made in the United 
States and England will also be discussed together because they relate 
for the most part to similar problems. : 
Scientific studies in Germany and France.“Interest in the scientific 
study of reading began in Germany and France about 1850 and increased. 
very slowly for a period of thirty years. The problems which commanded 
most attention related primarily to perception and eye-movements in 
readingY By 1855 investigations of these problems were under way in 
most of the leading universities in each of the two countries. "During the 
twenty years that followed, a large number of important studies were 
completed and published by such well-known scientists as Cattell, Erd- 
mann, Dodge, Goldscheider, Mueller, Zeitler, Messmer, Landolt, Lamare, 
and Javal’ Since 1905 important studies have been made in both 
countries. However, the period of greatest productivity preceded that 
date. 
Studies of visual perception—As early as 1844 Valentius became 
interested in studies of the perceptual processes in reading. His investiga- 
tions led to the conclusion that a reader perceives from three to four 
_ letters simultaneously in from 100 to 270 thousandths of a second. It was 
his judgment, however, that each letter is perceived separately. By 1886 
Cattell’s extensive studies began to appear. From the results of experi- 
ments in which letters, phrases, and sentences were exposed by means of 
a fall chronometer, he concluded that in ordinary reading perception 
2
-P-A-G-E-11
HISTORICAL SKETCH OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS 3 
proceeds by words, frequently by phrases and sentences, rather than by 
letters. These conclusions were later confirmed by the work of Erdmann 
and Dodge, who showed that words may be recognized at times even 
when individual letters are too small to be identified. The experiments 
of Goldscheider and Mueller followed shortly, supplying evidence that 
reading takes place not solely by letters or by word-wholes but rather by 
phrases, words, or letters, according to the reader’s familiarity with the 
reading matter and the difficulties which he encounters. 
Studies of the problems which have been described stimulated interest 
in a whole series of perceptual problems of which the following are 
examples: the most desirable grouping or arrangement of visual impres- 
sions, the value of different letters in the perception of words, the relation 
of the forms of letters to perception, and the fluctuation of attention 
during perception. The scientists who participated actively in the study 
of these problems were Goldscheider and Mueller at Berlin, Erdmann and 
Dodge at the University of Hallé, Zeitler at the University of Leipzig, 
and Messmer at the University of Zurich. Their investigations are im- 
portant because they contributed significant facts concerning the proces- 
ses involved in reading, the best form and arrangement of units of percep- 
tion, and desirable methods of primary reading. They also laid the foun- 
dation for much of the work along related lines which has been carried on 
recently in the laboratories of this country. The investigations made by 
these scientists have been summarized at considerable length by Dearborn 
(77), C. T. Gray (124), Huey (18s), and Schmidt (329). 
Studies of eye-movements in reading —While studies of perception were 
going forward, scientists in both France and Germany were keenly 
interested in studies of the behavior of the eye in readingWAbout 1879 _ 
Javal made the important discovery that eye-movements i reading are 
discontinuous, consisting of a series of alternate movements and pauses. 
This fact was highly significant and directed the attention of subsequent 
experimenters to detailed studies of the path of the eye’s fixation point 
and to the nature, function, and relation of fixation movements and 
pauses. ~ . 
Erdmann and Dodge were the first to discover that the first and the 
last fixations are located within the limits of the line. They also estimated * 
that from 44 to 34 of the time pf the eye’s passage from left to right along 
the line is spent in fixations.“The great rapidity at which the eye moves 
led to wide discussion concerning the possibility of vision during inter- 
fixation movements and to detailed experiments later both in Europe and 
in America.
-P-A-G-E-12
4 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
The early experiments concerning the fixation pause related primarily 
to the number of pauses per line and to their duration and location. Javal 
inferred that there is uniformly one pause to every ten letters. The results 
of Landolt, Dodge, and Erdmann differed somewhat and suggested the 
possibility of individual differences as well as differences due to the nature 
and difficulty of the material read. Dodge made detailed studies of read- 
ing pauses and discussed at length how the complex interpretative 
processes could occur during very brief intervals. Erdmann and Dodge 
also studied eye-fixations to determine their location with respect to 
syllables, words, and phrases. Their conclusion, that the fixation is 
usually near the middle of a word, was not supported by later experiments 
in which more refined laboratory methods were used. 
Results of early European experiments here were at least three 
notable results of the early studies of perception and eye-movements in 
Europe. First, facts were secured which presented a new and significant 
view of the processes involved in reading. This, in turn, suggested addi- 
tional problems for investigation and stimulated keen interest in America 
in the scientific study of reading problems. Furthermore, rapid progress 
was made in the development of experimental technique and mechanical 
devices for securing. accurate records or example, the work of Lamare 
and Javal at the University of Paris and of Ahrens at the University of 
Rostock on devices for studying eye-movements paved the way for the 
work in American laboratories by Lough, Delabarre, Huey, Dodge, 
Dearborn, Judd, Freeman, Schmidt, C. T. Gray, and Buswell and led 
ultimately to highly refined methods of photographing eye-movements., 
Scientific studies in the United States and England—An extensive 
bibliographical study of investigations of reading in the United States 
and England resulted in references to 436 studies which are more or less 
scientific in character. Of'these, more than 95 per cent were made in this 
country. By tabulating the studies published during each period of five 
years since 1880, facts were revealed concerning the development of in- 
terest in this field of research. These facts are summarized in Table I. 
One study included in the bibliography which bears no date of publication 
was omitted from this table. 
Table I shows that prior to 1896 only four studies were reported. 
From 1896 to 1910, inclusive, considerable interest developed in the study 
of reading problems. Between 1911 and rors there was a notable increase 
in the number of investigations reported. Since 1916 this country has 
witnessed an interest in the scientific study of reading problems which has 
never been equaled. A study of the investigations referred to in the table
-P-A-G-E-13
HISTORICAL SKETCH OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS 5 
shows that the period since 1880 divides somewhat naturally into three 
divisions, namely, the early period from 1884 to r9ro, the transition 
period from 1911 to 1915, and the current period, which began about 1916. 
The early period (1884-1910).—The first study in the early period 
was made by Romanes and was concerned with the rate of adult reading. 
By the end of rg9z0 at least thirty-four studies had been published. It is 
both interesting and significant that more than one-half of these investiga- 
tions were laboratory studies relating to problems in the psychology and 
physiology of reading. This is not surprising, however, when it is recalled 
that laboratory studies were pursued vigorously in continental Europe. 
The reports of such studies published in this country clearly recognize

their relation and indebtedness to various investigations in Germany - 
and France. The scientists who contributed most generously during this - 
early period were Huey, Dearborn, Dodge, Dockeray, Franz, Griffing, . 
Quantz, Sanford, Secor, and Whipple. 
Other problems which were studied prior to 1911 relate to children’s 
interests in reading, vocabulary tests, rate of adult reading, rhythm in 
oral reading, and the historical development of school readers. Although 
several classroom studies were made during this period, most of the 
contributions are directly traceable to the interest and laboratory work of 
educational psychologists. Two important results of these studies form’ 
the basis of present-day reforms in reading. They are the clear-cut dis- 
tinction between oral reading and silent reading and the recognition of 
individual differences in reading habits.
-P-A-G-E-14
6 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
The transition period (1911-15).—The period from rorzr to 1915, 
inclusive, is rightly characterized as a period of transition. It marks the 
beginning of a broader interest in scientific studies of reading and a larger 
recognition of the importance of applying scientific methods to the study 
of classroom problems. For example, between 1911 and 1913 most of the 
studies which were made related to such problems as methods of learning 
to read, the relative merits of different methods of primary reading, 
the need of phonetics, the Course of study, and the amount and quality 
of reading in various schools and grades. The explanation of this wide 
interest in classroom problems is found in the fact that the results of 
studies made in the early period challenged the validity of traditional 
methods of teaching reading and suggested numerous practical problems 
for investigation. 
A second fact which explains the transitional character of this period 
was the introduction of a new instrument of investigation. During 1914 
and 1915 two-thirds of the studies reported related to the organization, 
standardization, and application of reading tests. Through their use it 
became possible to study, under classroom conditions, the reading habits, . 
achievements, and difficulties of large groups of children. As a result, 
studies were undertaken on a scale which had been impossible under 
the restrictions of laboratory technique. By the close of 1915 scientists, 
administrators, and teachers were measuring the results of instruction in 
reading, comparing achievement in oral and silent reading, determining 
the factors which make for rapid progress, studying the errors and diffi- 
culties of individual children, and measuring the progress of pupils 
taught by different methods. These examples indicate only a few of the 
new problems which began to command attention about 1914 and 1915. 
The transition from the somewhat exclusive study of laboratory problems 
to scientific inquiries into practically every phase of reading is due largely 
to the contributions of the earlier laboratory studies and to the develop- 
ment of instruments of investigation which could be used on a wide scale 
under a variety of conditions. 
The current period of unprecedented interest in reading investigations.— 
There are at least three characteristics of the current period which should 
be emphasized. The first is the tremendous increase in the number of 
studies published. At least sixty-nine praiseworthy studies were published 
in 1923. This number is almost equal to the total number reported be- 
tween 1880 and 1916. This increase was due to the fact that scientists, 
school administrators, and teachers recognized the urgent need of study- 
ing reading problems. The interest has become so widespread that there
-P-A-G-E-15
HISTORICAL SKETCH OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS 7 
are very few progressive school systems and research centers which are not 
making each year scientific studies of one or more reading problems. 
A second characteristic of this period is the wide variety of problems 
which are commanding attention. In harmony with expectation, studies 
relating to the derivation, standardization, validity, and use of tests have 
been very numerous. In addition, keen interest has been shown in such 
problems as are suggested by the following: methods of learning to read; 
relative merits of different methods of teaching beginning reading; the 
need of phonetics; the content of school readers; children’s interests in 
reading; appropriate reading materials for the various grades; the physical 
makeup of books; the hygiene of reading; provision for individual differ- 
ences; diagnostic and remedial work; prognosis; relation between reading 
achievement and intelligence; relation between reading achievement and 
class marks; effect of practice on specific phases of reading, such as speed 
and comprehension; the advantages of classification into ability groups; 
the objectives of reading instruction; and the uses of reading in school and 
in adult life. While these studies have been in progress, a series of very 
“important investigations have been carried on in reading laboratories. 
For example, C. T. Gray (124) made extensive studies of the differences 
between good and poor readers. Buswell (sx) studied the significance of 
the eye-voice span in reading. He also distinguished fundamental habits 
* in both oral and silent reading and determined the periods at which they 
develop most rapidly. Judd and Buswell (203) made extensive studies of 
types of silent reading amd pointed out the effect on reading habits of 
changes in the purpose and content of what is read. In fact, during the 
last eight years practically every phase of reading has been examined 
critically and subjected to one or more forms of scientific study. 
yA third characteristic of the current period is the large number of 
studies which have been madé in classrooms by teachers and school 
officers. This is one of the most significant and hopeful tendencies of the 
times. It is due in part to the development of instruments of investigation 
which may be used effectively in studying practical issues. It is due 
primarily, however, to a clear recognition of the fact that there are numer- 
ous classroom problems which await solution and to a desire and willing- 
ness on the part of school officers and teachers to make use of scientific 
methods in the study of these problems. 
The problem of the future —The lesson to be drawn from the history 
of scientific studies of reading is perfectly clear. As investigation proceeds, 
there must be active co-operation between scientists, school officers, and 
teachers. The scientist must continue his laboratory studies, discover
-P-A-G-E-16
8 . INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
fundamental differences in reading processes and habits, outline the 
principles which determine effective methods of teaching, and develop 
methods of investigation which can be used in the classroom. Adminis- 
trators must provide agencies for dealing effectively with. the mental 
processes and habits discovered in the laboratory, for applying the instru- 
ments of investigation which are available, for checking the results of 
teaching, and for discovering additional problems for study and investi- 
gation. Teachers must be zealous students of reading problems, must ° 
apply the results of scientific studies in improving and refining their 
technique of teaching, and must make use of scientific methods in the 
daily study of classroom problems. Only through continuous and whole- 
hearted co-operation on the part of all the agencies interested in reading 
problems can we hope to attain an adequate solution of both the theoreti- 
cal and the practical issues that are involved.

SIGNIFICANT FACTS CONCERNING READING IN MODERN LIFE 
Problems for consideration—The purpose of this chapter is to sum- 
marize the results of investigations that contribute information concern- 
ing reading in modern life. The specific problems to be considered relate 
to the importance of intelligent reading, the rapid increase in the amount 
of reading, wide variations itz the reading proclivities of adults in different 
sections of the country, possible causes of these variations, and the per- 
sistence of illiterac: 
Importance of uelligent reading. —In a series of investigations which 
included conferences with more than nine hundred adults, Gray (140), 
Parsons (290), and otliers found “that intelligent reading is a most 
significant means of familiarizing adults with current events, with signifi- 
cant social issues; with community and national problems, and with 
American institutions, ideals, and aspirations” (140: 349-50). It was also 
found to be an indispensable means of attaining vocational efficiency, of 
extending experience, of developing a broad outlook on life, and of secur- 
ing pleasure and profit during leisure hours. 
Some of the most frequently mentioned specific purposes of silent 
reading follow: to keep informed concerning currént events; to secure 
specific information of value in making plans; to learn more about events 
or problems of special interest; to secure the opinions of others concerning 
civic, social, or industrial problems; to keep in touch with business or 
professional developments; to secure suggestions concerning efficient 
methods of doing work; to determine the important items in correspond- 
ence, messages, and instructions; to follow directions; to advance in one’s 
field of work; to broaden one’s range of information; to keep the mind 
stimulated with important things to think about; to develop a broad out- 
look on life; to secure pleasure during leisure hours; to satisfy curi- 
osity. EW 
Practically all the reading of adults is done silently. Nevertheless, 
several important purposes or occasions of oral reading were mentioned. 
The three which were mentioned most frequently were to inform or 
entertain others in private or public, to increase one’s understanding and 
appreciation of materials read, and to entertain children or interest them 
in reading.
-P-A-G-E-18
10 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
The materials read included practically every field of interest and 
activity. Searching investigations are needed concerning the value of 
much of the material that is read. However, evidence of the social need 
of intelligent reading was so clear and convincing that there can be no 
question concerning its importance as a subject of instruction. 
Rapid increase in the amount of reading —Judd (202) summarized 
facts which show that from 1850 to 1880 the percentage of increase in 
the number of issues of newspapers and periodicals which were published 
in the United States paralleled somewhat closely the percentage of in- 
crease in the population. From 1880 to 1910, however, the number of 
issues of newspapers and periodicals increased more than 500 per cent. 
During the same period the increase in population was less than 100 per 
cent. Interesting facts concerning the situation at a later date have been 
summarized by Reeder as follows: 
According to Ayer’s American Newspaper Annual and Directory for 1922, 
there were circulated in the United States each day last year 31,810,672 copies 
of daily newspapers, an average of more than one for each family. Besides these 
daily newspapers, there were distributed millions of copies of weekly newspaper: 
magazines, and books. The twenty largest magazines of the country had : 
combined circulation of 21,430,615, while the several thousand smaller magz. 
zines had a combined circulation almost as large [312: 236]. 2 
The percentage of increase in the amount of library reading durin: 
recent years has been at least as great as the percentage of increase i: 
the number of issues of newspapers and periodicals. Parsons (290) studie: 
the facts for Chicago and found that in 1880 the population of that cit: 
was 503,298 and the public-library circulation, 306,751. In 1920 thi 
population was 2,701,705, and the library circulation was 7,651,928. A: 
compared with 1880, the population had increased at least five times an: 
the library circulation more than twenty-five times. Such facts indicat: 
that the United States is rapidly becoming a nation of readers and tha 
the responsibility of the school to teach pupils to read intelligently grow 
larger each year. © 
Wide variations in amount of reading.—Unfortunately, the readin, 
proclivities described do not exist to the same degree in the various state 
and sections of the country. By studying the circulation in each state c 
the ten magazines having the largest average number of paid subscrig: 
tions, Reeder determined the percentage that the circulation for eacl 
state is of the population of that state. Table IL (312: 239) shows thi 
ranks of nine groups of states and reveals wide differences in the readin; 
proclivities in different sections of the country. In discussing these differ 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
FACTS C@NCERNING REABING IN MODERN LIFE Ir 
ences, Reeder pointed out the fact that there are high correlations be- 
tween the ranks of the states in amount of reading and their ranks on 
the basis of such other items as intelligence, the efficiency of their school 
systems, their productivity “as determined by agricultural and manu- 
factured goods produced,” and the extent to which they furnish national 
leaders. No definite conclusion was reached, however, concerning the 
causes of the sectional differences in amount of reading.

Keator (208) challenged the validity of Reeder’s list of the ten most 
popular magazines because they do not correspond with the figures in 
the American Newspaper Annual and Directory for 1922. He also “ven- 
tures the guess that the relative magazine reading rank of the states is 
due to the interaction of the travel and distance upon the relative 
literacy of the population of each state.” In a subsequent study Reeder 
(313) compared the circulation of the ten most widely read magazines 
and of thirteen “high-brow” magazines. The correlation between the 
results for the two groups of magazines was .93, which indicates that the 
states which read popular magazines most widely are also the states 
which read the so-called “better” magazines most frequently.
-P-A-G-E-20
12 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Possible causes of differences in reading proclivities—Bagley (11) 
determined the correlation (Pearson formula) between magazine circula~ 
tions as given by Reeder and the Burgess indexes of school efficiency for 
twenty-six states in which “at least 55 per cent of the total population 
was native to the state according to the 1910 census.”” The correlation 
coefficients for 1910 and 1920 were .84 and .82, respectively. Additional 
findings follow: 
With literacy [white adults, 1920 census], the correlation of magazine 
circulation for the twenty-six states is much lower (.76). Magazine reading 
seems to go well with the kind of intelligence measured by Army Alpha; here 
the correlation is .89. The states that read magazines seem also to be the states 
- that produce leaders, the correlation with birth-states of Who’s Who notables 
being .85. In every way, however, good schools seem to have the best claim to 
whatever honor there may be in causing people to buy the ten magazines listed 
in Mr. Reeder’s table. And this, I think, is no slight degree of honor [11: 532]. 
Parsons (290) made a detailed study, through personal conferences, 
of the reading habits of 314 adults distributed among eight occupational

In addition, 523 adults were questioned less fully. An analysis of the data 
secured revealed three possible causes of differences in the amounts read by 
the adults who were questioned: (1) The amount of reading is much greater 
in cities than in the country, as shown in Table ITI (2go: 52,56,60). (2) The 
amount of reading varies widely in different occupational groups. This is 
shown clearly by the data in TableIV (290: 68, 71), which gives the average 
number of books read in six months and the average amount of time given 
daily to the reading of books, newspapers, and magazines. (3) The 
amount of reading varies widely with the educational advantages which 
the individuals have had. ‘The data in Table V (290: 75, 78) show clearly
-P-A-G-E-21
FACTS CONCERNING READING IN MODERN LIFE s 33 
the influence of education on the number of books read in six months and 
on the amount of time given daily to the reading of books, magazines, 
and newspapers. The additional fact should be mentioned that the per- 
centage of the total reading time given to the reading of newspapers 
decreases as the amount of education increases.

The studies to which reference has been made show that the amount 
of reading in social life varies with intelligence, the efficiency of schools, 
the amount of education received, occupation, place of residence, and the 
influences which make for leadership. In commenting on variations with- 
in groups, Parsons pointed out the following significant causal factors: 
lack of available reading materials, little or no interest in reading, lack
-P-A-G-E-22
4. INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
of knowledge of sources and value of different types of reading material, 
and poor reading habits. There is need at present for detailed studies to 
verify the significance of these factors and to determine others. When the 
list has been completed, it will doubtless be found that many of them can 
be controlled and modified. There is clear evidence at the present time, 
however, to justify each state in providing the best schools it can afford 
and in demanding a type of instruction that results in permanent habits 
of intelligent reading. 
The persistence of illiteracy.—A significant measure of the nation’s 
problem in teaching reading is the number of illiterates among its popula- 
tion. A conservative estimate of this number was obtained in 1920 by 
the Census Bureau, which applies the term “illiterate” only to those who 
“have had no schooling whatever” (273). On this basis, the total number 
of illiterates was 4,931,905; of these, 3,084,733 were native born. These 
numbers are appalling and suggest one of the weak spots in our present 
educational system. 
More serious evidence of illiteracy in this country was secured during 
the war, when 1,522,256 soldiers and sailors were given tests which re~ 
quired “ability to read and understand newspapers and to write letters.” 
The results of the tests showed that 24.9 per cent of the men tested were 
unable to read and write sufficiently well to do the simple tasks assigned 
(273: 280). The significance of these facts has been discussed by Burgess 
as follows: 
These findings have attracted widespread attention and comment; but 
there is another significant fact concerning them that has not been emphasized. 
This is that although one-fourth of the men could not read well enough to take 
tests based on reading, this deficiency was not caused by their never having 
learned to read. The fact is that an overwhelming majority of these soldiers 
had entered school, attended the primary grades where reading is taught, and 
had been taught to read. Yet, when as adults they were examined, they were 
unable to read readily such simple material as that of a daily newspaper 
[48: 12-12]. 
An additional fact concerning the status of illiteracy should be men- 
tioned. ‘Between 1910 and 1920 there was an average annual decrease 
in the United States of 58,426 in the number of illiterates. If this rate of 
decrease continues, illiteracy will not disappear for eighty-four years” 
(273: 278). These facts make it clear that action should be taken at once 
to insure effective reading habits on the part of an increasingly large 
proportion of our prospective citizens.

Summary.—The investigations to which reference has been 
justify the following summary statements and conclusions: (1) Intelligent 
reading is indispensable to effective participation in modern social life 
and should be emphasized vigorously in every program of instruction. 
(2) The amount of reading that is done is increasing rapidly. Conse- 
quently scheols should use every effort to familiarize young people with 
the sources and value of different types of reading material and should 
train them to read intelligently and to utilize their reading time wisely. 
(3) The amount read varies widely in different sections of the country and 
even within small groups. We need to know more concerning the causes 
of these differences. It is clear, however, that each state should provide 
the best schools it can afford and should insist on a type of instruction 
that results in permanent habits of intelligent reading. (4) Illiteracy is 
widespread and is decreasing at a surprisingly slow rate. Each community 
should launch at, once a campaign to eliminate illiteracy from its midst.

CHAPTER IV 
THE RELATION OF READING TO SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 
Problems for consideration—Habits of intelligent reading are as 
essential in school activities as in adult life. One measure of their impor- 
tance is the wide variety of uses made of reading in school. Another meas- 
ure is their relation to progress in various subjects, particularly those that 
involve reading. It is the purpose of this chapter to summarize investiga- 
tions which supply information concerning the uses of reading in school 
activities and the relation of reading ability to progress in school work. 
USES OF READING IN SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 
Uses of reading in elementary-school subjects—Only three tabular 
studies of the uses of reading in school are available. The first, hitherto 
unpublished, was made by the writer in 1918. Two hundred and fifty 
fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade teachers of Rochester and Buffalo, New 
York, and Rapides Parish, Louisiana, were asked to submit lists of the 
ways in which pupils use reading in preparing assignments in content 
subjects. Ten of the most frequently mentioned purposes for which 
reading is used follow: 
Associating ideas read with previous experience. 
Finding answers to thought-provoking questions. 
Finding the author’s aim or purpose. 
Finding the most important idea of a paragraph or selection. 
Selecting important points and supporting details. 
Drawing valid conclusions from materials read. 
Selecting facts which relate to a problem under consideration. 
Judging the validity of statements. 
Discovering problems for additional study. 
Remembering and reproducing what is read. 
An analysis of the teachers’ reports by subjects showed that reading: 
is essential in most school activities and that its uses vary somewhat im 
the different subjects. Examples of the uses which were reported in four 
subjects follow: 
Literature 
To get the central point 
To determine the sequence of events 
To remember and reproduce the plot of a story

To determine motives of people and to form ideals by reading of the lives of 
others : : 
Geography . 
To prepare detailed, well-organized reports for class discussion 
To trace causes leading to certain events . 
To find out the reasons, the why’s, the how’s 
To compare statements and draw conclusions 
To verify conclusions reached in class 
History 
To distinguish between the important and the unimportant 
To distinguish between cause and effect 
To compare arguments or reports in different books 
To trace the development of historical events 
To select facts from several sources concerning problems discussed in class 
Arithmetic 
To determine the essential conditions of problems 
To secure information necessary in understanding problems 
To understand and remember definitions and rules 
The results of this investigation show clearly that reading is intimate- 
ly related to the study activities in such elementary-school subjects as 
literature, geography, history, and arithmetic. Similar studies should be 
made in order to determine more fully the uses of reading in all school 
activities and their relative importance. 
Types of learning required in textbook study—Monroe secured the 
co-operation of 317 teachers in the seventh and eighth grades and in the 
high school in a study of the types of learning in textbook study “in 
which reading is the central activity.” The following list includes the 
twelve types of learning that were selected. 
I. Comprehension of material read plus memorization so that it can be 
reproduced. 
II. With the text at hand preparation of a summary which contains the 
central ideas of the assignment studied. 
III. With the text at hand preparation of an outline which gives the princi- 
pal points and supporting details arranged to show order of relative importance 
and relation to each other. 
IV.. Obtaining information for the purpose of solving problems or answering 
questions. 
V. Extension of one’s range of general information by reading widely 
material directly related to a given subject. 
VI. Discovery of co.lateral or illustrative material for topics or problems 
under discussion.
-P-A-G-E-26
18 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
VIL. Enlargement of vocabulary. 
VIII. Appreciation of the significance of each word used in a concisely 
expressed statement or principle. 
IX. A clear comprehension of the essential conditions of a problem which 
is to be solved. 
X. Discovery of new or supplementary problems related to the topic being 
studied. 
XI. Drawing valid conclusions from given data or statements. 
XII. Following directions with accuracy and reasonable speed [266: 5~7]. 
The percentage of teachers in eleven subjects mentioning each type 
of study is shown in Table VI (266: x1). The data indicate that pupils

are required to engage in several types of learning in each subject. There’ 
are wide differences among teachers with respect to these requirements. 
“Some teachers appear to be restricting the learning process to one or 
two types, while others are requiring many types of learning.” A second 
fact revealed by the table is that the two most frequently mentioned types 
of learning vary for the different subjects. For example, in geography 
Types I and V are most prominent; in literature Types I and VII are 
most prominent; and in arithmetic Types IV and TX are most prominent. 
“The fact that different subjects demand different types of learning 
makes it necessary that the teacher of each subject give training to the - 
pupils in the type of learning required in that subject.” Similar conclu- 
sions were reached in a study (135) of the uses high-school pupils made 
of reading in preparing assignments as reported by 250 teachers.
-P-A-G-E-27
RELATION OF READING TO SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 19 
Two additional facts brought out by Monroe’s study concern the 
relative importance and difficulty of the twelve types of learning. Their 
relative importance was determined on the basis of the frequency with 
which they were mentioned. Their relative difficulty was determined on 
the basis of statements made by teachers concerning the difficulties en- 
countered by pupils in preparing assignments. The order of importance 
is as follows, the most important first: I, IV, XI, XII, IX, V, VII, TU, 
X, OT, VI, VEIL. The order of difficulty is as follows, the most difficult 
first: XI, IX, X, VIII and XII, IV, II, I and VI, V, VII, I. The data 
secured indicate that these types of learning vary widely in importance 
and difficulty. 
Concluding statements.—The results of these studies show that reading 
is used in both elementary and high schools for a surprisingly large num- 
ber of purposes and that the uses made of it in one subject differ to a con- 
siderable degree from the uses made of it in other subjects. It is evident, 
therefore, that reading is as essential and its uses are as varied in school 
as in other life activities. As will be shown later, the habits and attitudes 
employed in reading differ with the purpose. It follows, therefore, that 
teachers face the responsibility of teaching pupils to read effectively in a 
large number of situations. In order to determine a more complete list 
of essential reading activities and their relative importance, studies should 
be made of all school activities that involve reading. Furthermore, de- 
tailed analyses of the reading activities themselves are necessary in order 
to determine the attitudes, habits, and skills that should be emphasized 
in class instruction. 
RELATION OF READING ACHIEVEMENT TO SCHOOL PROGRESS 
Plan of discussion—A second measure of the importance of reading 
in school is its relation to progress in various school subjects. In sum-. 
marizing the investigations that relate to this problem, those studies will 
be referred to first which relate to progress in all subjects. Later, those * 
studies which relate to progress in specific subjects will be summarized. 
Studies relating to progress in all subjects —In 1916 and again in 1917 
Fretwell (100) gave the following tests to seventy-four sixth-grade boys: 
Thorndike visual vocabulary, Thorndike reading, Trabue composition 
(two tests), Ayres spelling, Woody arithmetic (multiplication and divi- 
sion), and Woodworth-Wells logical relations (opposites, mixed relations, 
and easy directions). The average of all school marks made during the 
first six grades was correlated with the results of each test and with the 
composite results of all tests. The correlation with comprehension, as
-P-A-G-E-28
20 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
measured by the Thorndike Scale Alpha 2, was .22 in 1916 and .20 in 
1917; the correlation with the composite results of all tests was .29 in 
1916 and .32 in 1917. These findings suggest that the relation between 
reading achievement and general standing in all elementary-school sub- 
jects is somewhat low. They also suggest that a wide range of abilities 
is essential to rapid progress in school work. 
Correlations were also found by Fretwell between class marks for 
the first year of the junior high school and (1) comprehension and (2) the 
composite of all tests. The correlation between comprehension and class 
marks was .43 in 1916 and .37 in 1917. The correlation between class 
marks and the composite of all tests was much higher, being .57 in 1916 
and .55 in 1917. These findings are in harmony with natural expectation. 
As one advances through the grades, the ability to understand what is 
read becomes increasingly important. The findings also support the 
conclusion that abilities other than those involved in intelligent reading 
are necessary to success in school work. 
Other studies at the junior high school level confirm Fretwell’s 
findings as to the degree of relationship between the results of reading 
tests and the general average of class marks. They also show that the 
relation varies among schools and with the type of comprehension test 
used. For example, Case (57) gave two tests to ninth-grade pupils in 
two schools in order to determine their ability to grasp the main items 
and fundamental principles in passages relating to physics and economics. 
The results were correlated with the average of the final marks in all 
subjects. The coefficients of correlation in School A were .42 for Test I 
and .39 for Test IT; in School B, .49 for Test I and .43 for Test II. Smith 
(343) gave four different tests to ninth-grade pupils and correlated the 
results with the average marks in all subjects. The correlations between 
class marks and the scores for the problem-solving test, the paragraph 
test, the information test, and the narrative test were .46, .54, .51, and 
40, respectively. These findings indicate clearly that there is a very 
definite relation between comprehension and class marks but that the 
degree of relationship varies for different schools and with the type of 
test used. , 
Two investigations among college students deal with the relation 
between reading achievement and class marks. Webb (407) gave the 
Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test for high-school pupils to 
eighty-seven college students. The correlation between the comprehen- 
sion scores and scholarship was .36; between the rate scores and scholar- 
ship, .27. These findings indicate that comprehension as determined by 
the Monroe test has greater prognostic value than has the rate of reading.
-P-A-G-E-29

RELATION OF READING TO SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 2r- 
Webb also combined the scores on the Army Alpha Intelligence Test with 
the scores on the comprehension test and computed the correlation be- 
tween these combined scores and scholarship marks. The result was a 
correlation of .60. These findings indicate that scholarship depends on 
ability to read, supplemented by other qualities or abilities, such as a 
high level of intelligence. 
At the close of the spring semester, 1917, Haggerty and Thomas (154) 
gave the Haggerty reading test for college students to all the Freshmen 
in the academic college of the University of Minnesota. The results of 
the test were correlated with class marks in rhetoric (.392) and with the 
year averages in all subjects (.256). Correlations were also determined 
between rhetoric marks and the year averages in all subjects. The corre- 
lations show that “efficiency in the reading test was not a measure of the 
attainment of students in all college work to the same degree that it 
indicated success in rhetoric. .... Furthermore, the rhetoric marks were 
more indicative of success in other school subjects than were the scores 
in reading.” The authors point out the fact that the tests were open to 
the criticism that they contained questions too easy to differentiate the 
students and that the time element was not controlled. Nevertheless, the 
results show that habits of intelligent reading are important factors in 
‘college work and that they seem to be of greater value in some subjects 
than in others. 
The various studies to which reference has been made lead to the 
following conclusions: (1) There is a fair degree of positive relationship 
between reading achievement and class marks in all subjects. (2) This 
relationship varies with the reading tests used and with the schools 
investigated. The causes of these variations present excellent problems 
for further investigation. (3) The results of reading tests do not correlate 
as highly with class marks as do the composite scores of reading and 
intelligence tests or the marks in rhetoric in the University of Minnesota. 
These findings indicate clearly that abilities other than those involved 
in intelligent reading are essential to success in school work. 
Studies relating to progress in specific subjects,—Reference has already 
been made to the fact that Haggerty and Thomas found a. correlation of 
.392 between the results of the Haggerty reading test and class marks in 
rhetoric in the freshman year at the University of Minnesota. This 
correlation was much higher than the correlation between reading achieve- 
ment and the average of all class marks (.256). 
Interesting studies have been reported at the high-school level. Smith 
determined the correlation between the results of four reading tests and 
the class marks of pupils in several subjects. The findings appear in
-P-A-G-E-30
22 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Table VII (343: 499). They indicate that in general the relation between 
reading achievement and the average of all class marks is greater than 
the relation between reading achievement and either English or algebra 
marks and that the degree of relationship varies with the subject and

with the type of test used. For example, the narrative test has much 
greater value in predicting success in English than in predicting success 
in algebra. The reverse is true in the case of the problem-solving test. 
Tn a study of high-school pupils made by Hackler (gr) the correlation 
between the scores on the Kansas Silent Reading Test and the class marks 
in first-year mathematics was .23. The correlations between class marks 
and intelligence-test scores were much higher, being .69 in the case of the 
Otis Group Intelligence Scale and .38 in the case of the Chicago Group 
Intelligence Test.

In the same study, Hackler determined the correlation between the 
average class marks in arithmetic and (1) the scores on the Kansas Silent 
Reading Test and (2) the scores on the Burgess Scale for Measuring 
Ability in Silent Reading. The coefficients of correlation for each grade 
are shown in Table VIIT (1g1: 50). The data show that there is wide
-P-A-G-E-31
RELATION OF READING TO SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 23 
variation in the degree of correlation in the different school grades be- 
tween class marks in arithmetic and the scores on each test. Unfortunately, 
class marks represent largely the personal judgments of teachers regarding 
the quality of the work of pupils. If we assume that variations in the . 
coefficients of correlation are due primarily to the unreliability of class 
marks, it is difficult to explain the wide differences in the coefficients of 
correlation for a given grade when different reading tests are used. 
Concluding statements.—The studies of Haggerty and ‘Thomas, Smith, 
and Hackler suggest several important conclusions: (1) There is con- 
siderable correlation between reading achievement and progress in par- 
ticular subjects, as measured by class marks. (2) The degree of correlation 
varies with the type of test used in measuring reading achievement. This 
is to be expected in view of the fact that the uses of reading vary with 
the different subjects. There is need of studies to determine the types of 
reading that are most essential, their relative importance in different 
subjects, and methods of making reading habits function to the maximum 
in each school activity that involves reading. (3) Scholarship depends on 
ability to read, supplemented by other qualities, such as a high level of 
intelligence. ~

CHAPTER V 
THE IMPORTANCE, ECONOMY, AND EFFICIENCY OF 
SILENT READING 
Problem.—The fact has been emphasized that habits of intelligent 
reading are essential both to4uccessful participation in the ‘activities of 
modern social life and to’satisfactory progress in school. It is the purpose 
of this chapter to summarize investigations which show the importance, 
economy, and efficiency of silent reading. 
IMPORTANCE OF SILENT READING 
Wider social use of silent reading —Information (140: 349) secured in 
conferences with more than nine hundred adults indicates that practically 
all their reading is done silently. “Fewer than 5 per cent reported that 
they read aloud on other than very infrequent occasions.” Parsons 
(ago: 96) secured information from 211 adults concerning their reading 
habits. Of this number, 137 reported no use of oral reading whatever. 
The answers of the 74 who read orally were distributed as follows: very 
seldom, 47; seldom, 19; frequently, 7; very frequently, 1. It is no doubt 
true that many adults who do not read orally could do so on occasions to 
distinct advantage. Even when such facts are taken into consideration, 
it is evident that silent reading is of greater social value than oral reading. 
. ECONOMY OF SILENT READING 
Superiority of silent reading in rate-—A distinguishing characteristic 
of oral reading is the fact that the words of a passage are pronounced 
audibly. This necessarily limits’ its rate, since the reader cannot proceed 
more rapidly than the vocal cords react. Inasmuch ai silent reading is 
not restricted in this way, it is natural to assume that it is a more rapid 
process than oral reading. 
Studies of adult reading.—Huey (185: 175) determined the rate of 
reading of twenty graduate students who had read extensively. “The 
average rate of the twenty students when reading silently was 5.63 words 
per second at their ordinary speed ‘and 8.21 at their maximal, while in 
reading aloud they averaged 3.55 words per second at their ordinary 
speed and 4.58 at their maximal.” Pintner and Gilliland (298: 204) also 
found that college students read more rapidly silently than orally. The 
4
-P-A-G-E-33
THE IMPORTANCE OF SILENT READING “25 
average time of reading twelve passages was 13 seconds for silent reading 
and 15.4 seconds for oral reading. Schmidt (329: 61) made careful labora- 
tory studies of the rate of reading and found that his adult subjects 
averaged 5.1 words per second when reading silently and 3.08 words per 
second when reading orally. These investigations make it clear that in 
general adults read much more rapidly silently than orally. 
Wide variations in rate of silent reading —When variations in rate of 
reading are considered, the superiority of silent reading becomes even 
more apparent. Huey (185: 174-75) found in his study of twenty adults 
that the readers ranged in rate “from an average of 2.5 words per second 
for the slowest reader to an average of 9.8 words for the fastest, when

  * Rearranged from authors’ data, 
reading silently at their ordinary rate. When the silent reading was at 
maximal speed, the rates ranged from 3.5 to 13.5 words per second. In 
reading aloud, the average of the slowest reader was 2.2 words per second 
and that of the fastest 4.7 at the ordinary rate, and at maximal speed the 
corresponding range was from 2.9 to 6.4 words per second.” Records 
secured by Schmidt (329) and Judd (204) confirm Huey’s findings con- 
cerning the wide variations in rate of silent reading. A comparison of 
these records shows that many adults read silently from three to five 
times as rapidly as they read orally. 
Studies of children’s reading —Children as well as adults read more 
rapidly silently than orally. Oberholtzer gave tests to eighteen hundred 
children in Grades III to VIII, inclusive. A summary of the results 
appears in Table IX (276: 317) in terms of the average number of words 
read per second. Judd studied the rate of oral and silent reading of several
-P-A-G-E-34
26 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
thousand children in forty-four schools. The results in terms of the 
average number of lines read per minute are included in Table IX (200: 
130). 
The data in Table LX show that in all the grades included in the two 
studies the average rate of silent reading was higher than the average 
rate of oral reading. Practically all the published studies confirm this 
general conclusion. For example, Mead (254) tested 112 sixth-grade 
pupils and found that in all classes but one the average rate was more 
rapid in silent reading than in oral reading. In a later study (255), 
including 340 pupils representing all grades from the third to the tenth, 
inclusive, except the ninth, he found that the average number of lines 
read per minute was greater for every class in silent reading than in oral 
reading. Pintner (296) reported the results of a study of twenty-three 
fourth-grade pupils which showed that the average rate of oral reading 
was twenty lines a minute and of silent reading twenty-eight lines a 
minute. : 
The results of a study by Pintner and Gilliland (298) do not agree 
fully with the results which have been presented. Their data show that 
high-school pupils and seventh- and eighth-grade pupils read on the 
average more rapidly silently than orally and that pupils in Grades ITT 
to VI, inclusive, read at about the same rate silently as orally. It is 
difficult to explain the cause of the relatively low average rate of silent 
reading for the grade pupils who were tested. It is possible that they had 
never acquired effective habits of silent reading. Inasmuch as practically 
all the studies that have been made show a decided superiority for rate 
of silent reading, we are justified in concluding that most children and 
adults read more rapidly silently than orally, 
-EFFICIENCY OF SILENT READING 
Superiority of silent reading in comprehension—~The statement is 
frequently made that oral reading is more effective than silent reading in 
the interpretation of what is read because the reader secures impressions 
through the ear as well as through the eye. Studies of this problem, how— 
ever, show that comprehension is usually greater in silent reading. Foy, 
example, Mead (254) found in two-minute tests that reproductions were 
better in each of the five sixth-grade classes which he tested when the 
reading was done silently. In a subsequent study (255) one-minute test 
were given to seventeen classes in Grades III to X, inclusive, except the 
ninth grade. “Fifteen out of seventeen classes did better by the stent 
method of reading. Seventy per cent of the children taken separately dia

better by this method.”. Pintner (296) reported that a group of twenty- 
three fourth-grade children reproduced 34 per cent of the points when 
reading orally and 4o per cent when reading silently. 
Pintner and Gilliland (298) gave tests to pupils in Grades III to XII, 
inclusive, and to college students, Each of the paragraphs read contained 
“about fifty words and seven distinct ideas.” The results showed a de- 
cided similarity in the number of ideas reproduced when reading orally 
and silently. Summary records are included in Table X (298: 207). 
In a subsequent test (298) in which longer passages, each containing 
about two hundred words, were used, the records of fifty adults (uni-

versity students) showed higher rate and better comprehension when the 
reading was done silently. 
The studies to which reference has been made show clearly that 
comprehension is usually better in silent reading than in oral reading. 
The evidence is much stronger in the studies which made use of tests 
covering a definite period of time, such as two minutes, than in the studies 
using tests which required the reading of passages of prescribed length, 
such as two hundred words. A possible explanation for this difference lies 
in the fact that the slower rate of oral reading may have aided some pupils 
in a more intensive study of the content while reading. When we take 
into account the amount of subject-matter read per unit of time, however, 
the evidence is decidedly in favor of silent reading. 
Summary.—The data presented in this chapter show that silent read- 
ing is used far more widely in social life than oral reading, that it is a 
much more rapid process, and that it is usually accompanied by better 
comprehension of what is read. When the amount that is read per unit 
of time is considered, the advantage of silent reading is even more appar- 
ent. Because of its greater importance, economy, and efficiency, the 
development of effective habits of silent reading should be emphasized 
in programs of instruction.

CHAPTER VI 
CURRENT READING AIMS, TIME ALLOTMENTS, AND AMOUNT OF 
READING IN THE VARIOUS SCHOOL GRADES 
Problems for consideration.—The preceding chapters have emphasized 
the importance of intelligent reading in school and life activities, the wide 
variety of uses made of reading, and the importance, economy, and 
efficiency of silent reading. It is the purpose of this chapter to summarize 
investigations concerning current aims of reading instruction and to 
discuss time allotments, uses made of the reading time, and the amount 
of material read. 
CURRENT AIMS OF READING 
Few investigations available-—Although the aims of reading instruction 
have been discussed widely during recent years, the results of only a - 
limited number of scientific studies of this problem have been published. 
The four which are summarized in this section reflect widely different 
views. 
Aims as stated by elementary-school teachers.—In 1917 the “most desir- 
able results or outcomes of the teaching of reading in the elementary 
school,” as reported by 715 teachers in a large city, were tabulated. The 
various aims mentioned and the percentage of teachers mentioning each - 
appear in Table XI (136: 340). It is evident that these aims reflect 
largely the earlier views with regard to reading instruction and fail to 
emphasize many of the uses made of reading in school work and other 
life-activities. . : 
Aims of reading in state courses of study for rural schools —Reinoeh] 
made a detailed analysis of the aims and content of reading instruction 
as given in forty-four state courses of study for rural schools. He wrote 
as follows concerning the courses studied in his survey: 
All but eight of the forty-four courses used were issued since 1914. Thirty— 
five appeared within the years 1915 and 1917. By January 1, 1920, twenty-one 
had been revised or reprinted. Of these, only 40 per cent show marked revisions, 
as to point of view, content, organization, or adaptation to rural schools. The 
forty-four courses surveyed may, therefore, be said to represent, to a very large 
extent, the courses still in use in rural schools [314: 2]. 
The aims which appeared most frequently in the courses studied 
follow:

The prevailing views of reading instruction were summarized by 
Reinoehl in a second way. He arranged the topics in elementary-school 
reading in the order of their frequency of appearance in thirty-five state 
courses of study. The topics which appeared in more than 80 per cent of 
the courses follow (314: 66)': stories, story-telling*; phonetics, phono- 
grams*; supplementary reading; pronunciation*; sounds, sound combina- 
tions*; blackboard lessons; silent reading; drill lessons; sight reading; 
natural expression; thought-getting; beautiful passages*; memorization; 
use of dictionary; clear enunciation; classics, literature; mechanics of 
reading*; correct articulation; poetry, poemis*; use of library books; oral 
reading; dramatization; picture study*; emphasis, inflection; voice train- 
ing; talking lessons, conversations; word method; action words*; sentence

method. It is evident from this list that the problems emphasized most 
vigorously are mastery of the mechanics of reading, effective oral reading, 
and enjoyment of good literature. 
Extensive survey of English objectives—Pendleton (292) has doubtless 
made the most detailed study of objectives of reading which has ever 
been undertaken. This was accomplished in connection with the painstak-* 
ing collection of 1,582 social objectives of English instruction. The seven 
sources of information consulted were “‘the hitherto unpublished state- 
ments of 272 current teachers of English, contributed to us personally; 
the similar utterances of about one hundred other educators; a perusal 
of all the articles, editorials, and notes pertaining to English which were 
published in eleven important educational periodicals during the years 
1915~20; a reading of pertinent portions of sixty-seven standard general 
volumes on education; an examination of 118 standard volumes about 
English or the teaching of English; a scrutiny of forty-nine particular 
state or municipal school courses of study, or teachers’ manuals, in 
English; and, finally, a scansion of a group of sixty-two current school 
textbooks on various phases and educational levels of this subject” 
(292! 11-12). 
The second step in the study was to catalogue the 1,581 objectives 
according to their comparative importance as judged by eighty competent 
teachers of English. For this purpose the objectives were typewritten on 
separate cards, and each judge was instructed to sort them into five or 
six piles, “indicating thus the degree of importance attached to each 
objective.” The rankings of the various judges were then combined and. 
the objectives arranged in the order of importance. The twelve objectives 
relating to reading which were considered most important follow: 
The habit of reading for enjoyment literature of the better sort. 
A taste for reading books (not merely magazines) of an excellent sort. 
An attitude of alert interest in the world and all things in it and a desire to 
increase one’s knowledge. 
A perennial, never failing interest in people; the habit of studying them 
sympathetically. 
The ability to refrain from marking or marring in any way a borrowed book. 
Habitual realization that good physical and mental health is fundamental 
to really profitable reading. . 
A taste for reading the better class of magazines, not the inferior fiction sort. 
—~The ability to rest one’s self and divert one’s mind from business or social 
perplexities through the enjoyable reading of literature. 
The ability to determine quickly and accurately from a dictionary the 
pronunciation of a word.
-P-A-G-E-39
AIMS, TIME ALLOTMENTS, AMOUNT OF READING 31 
An attitude of never injuring in any way library books which one is consult- 
ing. 
—~A genuine, deep-seated interest in the world of books. 
The complete list of objectives include 409 which relate more or less 
directly to reading. ‘It is evident from the examples given that the most 
important objectives reflect largely the views of teachers of literature. 
Limitations of the reading aims presented.—The studies of reading aims 
to which reference has been made have serious limitations. They indicate 
primarily what teachers of reading and literature have emphasized in the 
past and what has appeared most frequently in state courses of study. 
They summarize current practices rather than seek to determine the most 
valuable uses of reading in school and in modern social life. They are, 
therefore, of limited value in efforts to reorganize courses of study or to 
improve and refine the technique of teaching. The methods and results _ 
of the study reported in the following paragraphs are far more valuable 
and suggestive. 
Objectives of literature and general. reading.—In connection with a 
curriculum study in Los Angeles, teachers of literature selected from a 
comprehensive list those abilities “which should be kept in view as the 
goals of the work in literature and general reading. After they had thus 
pointed out the abilities to be aimed at, a statement of literature objec- 
tives which involved the more fundamental ones chosen was drawn up 
and submitted to the teachers for their consideration” (33: 45). The list 
of objectives which they selected follows: 
1, The ability, disposition, and habit of abundant and greatly diversified : 
reading as a means of enjoyable and fruitful indirect observation of men, things, 
and affairs, and of vicarious participation in those affairs. . 
2. The ability through reading to enter into and participate in the varied, 
but especially the serious, thought-life of the world. 
3. A proportioned intellectual apprehension, such as one’s native capacity 
will permit, of men, things, and affairs; together with the necessary normal 
interests, emotional accompaniments, etc. Specifically, such as the following: 
a) The nature of man, types of men, social classes, etc. 
6) Human institutions. 
c) Manners and customs. 
d) Special human groups and their specialized situations, activities, duties, 
problems, etc. [This includes occupation groups.] 
e) The genesis of man and his institutions, customs, arts, etc. 
f)} Man’s creations of myth, legend, and folklore. 
g) The world of technology. 
h) The world of fine arts.
-P-A-G-E-40
32 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
- 4) Man’s physical and geographical habitat: (r) the world of plant life, 
(2) the world of animal life, (3) the world of chemical phenomena, (4) the world. 
of physical phenomena, (5) the geological world, (6) the astronomical world. 
* A mind enriched with the world’s great literature. 
. A “human race,” “brotherhood of man,” “large-group” social conscious 
ness. * sympathetic and intelligent social attitudes and reactions—to things 
local, state, national, and international. 
6. Language abilities which in part result normally from abundant and 
diversified reading: 
a) Ability to read with proper ease, speed, and comprehension. 
8) Ability to spell the words of one’s writing vocabulary. 
¢) Command over an adequate reading, speaking, and writing vocabulary. 
d) Ability to use English which is grammatically correct, 
e) Ability to organize and express one’s thoughts effectively. 
f) Ability to get the essential thought of books or articles quickly with a 
minimum amount of reading. 
g) Ability to read a foreign language. 
h) A proper character and degree of language-mindedness. 
4) Amateur ability to do literary production of different kinds [33: 45-46]. 
The advantage of such a list is that it represents the results of a care— 
ful analysis of the objectives that are essential if selected abilities are to 
be emphasized. The limitation of the list is that the abilities and objec— 
tives were selected on the basis of teacher judgment. The list is only as 
valid as the judgments of the teachers were refined and exact. 
TIME ALLOTMENT 
The problem.—The amount of time which should be given to reading 
is a problem which has commanded attention in the past and which is 
still a vital issue. Only a limited number of studies of this problem have 
been published. Fortunately, those which are available represent practice 
in a variety of school situations. - 
Time allotted to reading in fifty large cities —An investigation of time 
allotments was made in 1914 by Holmes, who studied the time distribu— 
tions by grades and subjects for fifty cities. His results showed that an 
average of fifty-three minutes each day, or 30.6 per cent of the schoolday, _ 
was given to reading in the first grade and that the total amount of time 
and the percentage of recitations given to reading decreased gradually 
from the first grade to the eighth grade. His findings appear in Table 
XII (273: 26-27). 
Comparison of time allotment in Seatile with average time allotment zp 
forty-nine large cities —In 1924 Ayer reported the results of a comparative 
study of the time allotment for reading in Seattle with the average allot—

ment in forty-nine large cities. Table XTII contains a report of his find- 
ings (9: 140). 
These data indicate that some cities, such as Seattle, devote a much 
larger amount of time to reading than do other cities. The findings of 
Ayer are verified in a sense by the results of a study by McGaughy (244), 
who secured information from 375 cities. His data showed a total of

   1,914 minutes a week in Grades I to VI, inclusive, whereas the corre- 
sponding data for Seattle showed a total of 2,130 minutes a week. 
Ayer’s study revealed another important fact. He found that many 
large cities are at present modifying their courses of study and time allot- 
ments. “This is particularly true of the seventh and eighth grades, which 
in the majority of the cities are being gradually included in the junior 
high school organization. There is also a tendency in many of the cities
-P-A-G-E-42
34 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
to give less attention to arbitrary daily time allotments in the primary 
grades, where the work frequently goes by projects rather than by 
subjects” (9: 139). 
Time allotted to reading in thirty-one first-class schools of North Dakota. 
—Kirk secured copies of the actual schedules which were followed in 
thirty-one school systems, from which he calculated and tabulated the 
exact number of minutes a week spent in recitation. A summary of his 
findings appears in Table XIV (219: 537). 
The data show that on the average the first-class schools of North 
Dakota are giving more time to reading in each grade than are the schools

in the fifty cities studied by Holmes. They are not giving as much time 
to reading, except in the first grade, as the schools of Salt Lake City were 
at the time of the survey of that city (334: 140). Neither are they giving 
as much time to reading in the first grade as ten school systems of Michi— 
gan (427), for which the median is 88.6 minutes a day, or 443 minutes @ 
week. On the other hand, they are giving far more time to reading thay, 
are rural schools throughout the country. 
Time allotted to reading in rural schools—Reinoehl (314) tabulate, 
facts from the daily time schedules recommended in twenty-six mode} 
programs for one-year rural schools as they appeared in as many state 
courses of study. Special attention was given to the number of dail 
recitation periods and the total number of minutes a week allotted ta 
reading in each grade. The results of his study are presented in Table 
XV (314: 23-24). ; 
A comparison of these data with the data presented in Tables XI 
and XIII shows that the average amount of time given to reading jy, 
rural schools equals in very few cases the minimum amount of time giveyy 
to reading in schools in the larger cities. 
Tendencies in time allotment—Studies of time allotment in readin ge 
reveal several significant facts: (1) Schools in the large cities are siving
-P-A-G-E-43
. 
AIMS, TIME ALLOTMENTS, AMOUNT OF READING 35 
more time to reading in each grade than are schools in the smaller cities 
or county schools. (2) More time is given to reading in the first grade 
than in any other grade. (3) The amount of time given to reading 
decreases more or less gradually from the first grade to the eighth grade. 
(4) There are very wide differences among cities and within school sys- 
tems as to the amount of time devoted to reading in any given grade. (5) 
There is a distinct tendency to give less attention than formerly to arbi- 
trary daily time allotments. This is particularly true in the seventh and 
eighth grades.

USES MADE OF THE TIME DEVOTED TO READING | 
The problem —Recent investigations reveal the fact that the results 
which a school secures in a given subject depend as much, if not more, — 
on the way in which the time is used as on the total time allotment. At 
least four studies have been published which show how the time set aside 
for reading is used. The results of these studies suggest a number of 
problems for further investigation. 
Uses of the reading time in first-grade classes —Woody determined 
the percentage of the total time devoted to reading that was given to 
phonetics, to word-study, and to actual reading in 175 first-grade classes 
in ten school systems of Michigan. A summary of his findings appears in 
Table XVI (427: 8). This table shows that about two-thirds of the read- 
ing time is devoted to actual reading and that the remainder of the time 
is divided about equally between phonetics and word-study. “The quartile
-P-A-G-E-44
36 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
points deviate only 5 per cent from the central tendency and indicate, 
in general, uniformity of practice within the different cities. However, 
the distributions show many cases of extreme variations which raise many 
interesting problems of supervision” (427: 7). 
Distribution of time between recitation and study in the fifth grade——In 
connection with the Salt Lake City study, Sears secured data which

showed the distribution of the reading time in minutes per week between. 
recitation and study for the fifth grades in twenty-five schools. The 
distribution of the reading time for the first ten schools in Sears’s list 
is shown in Table XVII (334: 147). The facts presented represent quite

  accurately the practice in all the schools. It is evident, so far as this study 
is concerned, that no agreement existed with regard to the best distribu— 
tion of time between recitation and study. It is doubtless true that the’ 
practice must vary in different schools in harmony with the number of 
sections in a room and with the level of advancement reached by the 
pupils. , 
Distribution of time between oral and silent reading.—In the Indianap— 
olis survey of reading, detailed information was secured (136) concernin, 
the percentage of the total reading time devoted to oral reading and toe
-P-A-G-E-45
AIMS, TIME ALLOTMENTS, AMOUNT OF READING 37 
silent reading. Wide variation in practice in each grade was shown. A 
large majority of the first-grade teachers stated that they gave most of 
their time to oral reading and very little to silent reading. In the grades 
above the first there was a distinct tendency toward an equal distribution 
of time. This tendency became most pronounced in the fourth grade. 
The greatest diversity of practice was exhibited in the grades above the 
fourth. In interpreting these findings, two facts should be kept clearly 
in mind. First, the data were secured in 1917, before schoolroom practice 
had been greatly influenced by the recent emphasis on silent reading. 
Second, the records were based on teachers’ statements of their practice 
and not on records of the actual distribution of time. 
In a more recent study, McGaughy (244) secured reports of practices 
in 375 cities. In tabulating his data, the cities were classified into three 
population groups, namely, cities with populations from 8,000 to 29,999, 
cities with populations from 30,000 to 99,999, and cities with populations 
of 100,000 or more. The tables revealed several significant facts. (1) 
Oral reading was reported in 331 cities, and silent reading was reported 
in 305 cities. Thus wider provision is made for oral reading than for silent 
reading. (2) Larger cities provide silent-reading instruction in all grades 
more universally than do smaller cities. (3) Silent reading begins in the 
first grade in approximately six-sevenths of the larger cities. It is not 
reported for the first grade in almost one-half of the smaller cities. (4) 
Oral reading is provided in the lower grades in practically all the school 
systems. Only five of the 331 reporting do not include oral reading in the 
first grade. (5) Most of the school systems provide instruction in oral 
reading throughout the elementary grades. 
McGaughy’s results agree with the findings of the Indianapolis study 
concerning the wide diversity of practice in the distribution of the reading 
time to oral reading and silent reading. His results indicate a growing 
tendency to emphasize silent reading earlier in the grades. It seems, how- 
ever, that the traditional emphasis on oral reading still dominates and 
that silent reading is not yet emphasized in harmony with its importance. 
AMOUNT OF MATERIAL READ 
Few studies available—Very few studies relating to the amount of 
reading actually done in the various grades have been published. The 
reports that are available are very illuminating, and their implications 
are quite significant. 
Amount of reading in the primary grades.—Clark (63) secured a list 
of the books read in class periods in the first three grades of eight schools.
-P-A-G-E-46
38 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Stories read to the class were not included. An adult then read the listed 
material and kept a record of the time required. The data for each grade 
appear in Table XVIII. This table reveals wide variations in the amount 
read in different schools. Some schools, such as No. 1, read a relatively 
large amount in all grades; others, such as No. 6, read a relatively small 
amount; still others, such as No. 7, vary noticeably from grade to grade. 
When the fact is recalled that the amount of time given to reading in 
many third grades is two hundred hours or more a year, it is evident that 
the pupils of the schools included in this investigation were very slow 
readers, or had a very small amount of material to read, or devoted most 
of the class period to activities other than reading. .

* Rearranged from author’s data, 
Number of pages read in the first grade in ten school systems of Michigan. 
—Woody reports the results of a study to determine the numbers of pages 
read during the first five months and the second five months of the first 
grade in ten school systems of Michigan. Table XIX (427: 18-19) pre- 
sents a summary of his findings. This table shows that the median nura- 
ber of pages read was 157 for the first five months and 371 for the second. 
five months. Other tables showed that individual classrooms varied in 
the amount read from a very small number of pages (0-24) toa very large 
number of pages (800-899). The widest variations and the largest num~ 
bers of pages read were in the schools having “two groups” and in the 
“undifferentiated” classes. On the basis of these findings, Woody suggests 
that from 175 to 200 pages is a reasonable requirement for the first five 
months and that from 140 to 250 pages represents reasonable limits of q 
“zone of safety”; for the second five months he suggests 375 pages as q

reasonable requirement. These recommendations are based on current 
practice. There is need for additional studies to determine the causes of 
the wide differences in the amount that is read and to determine the 
amount which should be read under favorable conditions. 
Number of pages read in the first six grades.—In connection with the 
self-survey of the public schools of Sterling, Colorado, a study was made 
of the number of pages read in each grade during the year ending June 1,

    1917. Table XX (270: 54) presents a summary of the findings. The read- 
ing “includes the prepared reading, the sight reading, and the supervised 
or tested silent reading, but takes no account of library books, untested 
reading, or reading done in the preparation of other subjects.” 
Table XX reveals three facts. First, there is a gradual increase in the 
amount read from the first grade to the third and fourth grades and a 
much smaller amount read in both the fifth and the sixth grades than in 
the preceding grades, Second, there is wide variation in the amount read -
-P-A-G-E-48

in each grade. ‘This was naturally to be expected for a number of reasons, 
the more notable among which are variations in class ability, in‘ class 
attendance, in teaching ability, and in the individual interpretation of 
aims and the divergent ideals and methods of the various teachers.” 
Third, there is a much greater amount of material read in the first grades 
of Sterling than in the first grades of ten Michigan cities. 
Evidence that amount normally read may be greatly increased.—Ford 
(95) reports very significant results of a study in the schools of a, parish 
in Louisiana. A preliminary investigation showed that the average num- 
ber of basal texts required in any grade was 2.75 and that the range was 
from 1 to 6. The teachers were then asked how many they thought it 
possible for their pupils to read. The average number reported by fifty- 
six teachers was 3.25. The range was from 1 tog. Definite steps were then

taken to provide a greater amount of reading material, to improve the 
quality of the teaching, and to stimulate interest in independent reading. 
The amount read during the school year 1922-23 is reported in Table 
XXI (95: 34). This table shows that the average amount read exceeded 
the maximum amount suggested by the most optimistic teachers. More 
significant still is the fact that in every grade the rate and comprehension 
of the pupils, as measured by the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading © 
Tests, were decidedly below standard at the beginning of the school year 
and distinctly above standard at the end of the year. 
Amount of reading in community-life classes.—An effort is being made 
in many schools to enrich specific content courses by providing wide 
reading opportunities: This plan has been followed with marked success 
"by Hill, in the teaching of community life in connection with first-year 
English in the University High School of the University of Chicago.

the amount which can be read under favorable conditions in each grade 
present problems for further investigation. It is very significant that 
in the study reported by Ford the rate and comprehension of the pupils 
improved greatly with the increase in the amount read. The tendency 
to increase the amount of material read in content subjects is also very 
promising.

CHAPTER VII 
INDIVIDUAL- DIFFERENCES, RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE TO 
ACHIEVEMENT, TYPES OF CLASS ORGANIZATION 
Problems for consideration.—The purpose of this chapter is threefold: 
first, to discuss four important facts concerning individual differences and 
the provisions which are made for them in teaching reading; second, to 
consider the relation of intelligence to achievement in reading; and, third, 
to present the results of three types of experiments in providing for the 
needs of children. These experiments relate to grouping on the basis of 
general intelligence, grouping on the basis of achievement and needs in 
reading, and providing varied activities for pupils in the same group who 
differ widely in intelligence and reading needs. 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN ACHIEVEMENT 
Three significant facts concerning differences in achievement—One of 
the most impressive facts revealed by objective studies of reading relates 
to wide differences in achievement and rate of progress. Evidence of these 
differences has been secured in so many investigations that their existence 
is clearly recognized and accepted. It will be sufficient here merely to 
illustrate four significant facts about them. The first is that the children 
of a given grade vary widely in achievement; the second is that there is 
very great overlapping in achievement from grade to grade; the third is 
that a given pupil is much more advanced in some phases of reading than 
in others; and the fourth is that pupils progress in reading at different 
rates. In later chapters detailed reference will be made frequently to 
individual differences in specific phases of reading. / 
Wide differences and overlapping in achievement.—The wide variation, 
in achievement among pupils of a given grade and the extent of overlap— 
ping in different grades are illustrated in Table XXIII (131: 113). This 
table shows the distribution of 1,172 pupils in three grades on the basis, 
of the time required to read one hundred words silently. The average 
time required in Grade IV was 45.5 seconds; in Grade V, 38.9 seconds ; 
and in Grade VI, 35.8 seconds. These time units are equal to the folow— 
ing numbers of words a second: 2.20, 2.57, and 2.79, respectively. While. 
there was some progress from grade to grade, the impressive fact is the 
great amount of overlapping from grade to grade. Furthermore, the 
4 ; 
fy,

table shows that some pupils read from eight to twelve times as rapidly 
as other pupils in the same grade. What is true with regard to rate is 
equally true with regard to all other phases of reading. It is evident, 
therefore, that the pupils of a given grade or class do not as a rule repre- 
sent a given level of achievement. They represent rather different levels,

corresponding frequently to the achievement of pupils in more advanced 
or less advanced classes. 
Variations in achievement in different phases of reading —The fact that 
a given pupil is far more advanced in some phases of reading than in 
others is illustrated in Figure 1 (133), which gives the relative standing 
of thirteen pupils in seven phases of reading. The vertical divisions refer 
from left to right to general oral-reading achievement, rate of oral reading, 
and number of errors in oral reading as measured by the Gray test; rate 
of silent reading, number of questions answered'in five minutes, and
-P-A-G-E-52

accuracy of interpretation as measured by the Courtis Silent Reading 
Test No. 2; and comprehension as measured by the Thorndike Scaler 
Alpha 2. The broken vertical line in the middle of each section represents 
the average score of the grade. Distance to the left of the vertical line 
in each section represents relatively poor accomplishment, and distance 
to the right represents relatively good accomplishment. The figure 
reveals at a glance wide differences in the ability of pupils in different 
phases of reading. For example, Pupil 7 is somewhat deficient in oral 
reading but ranks above the average in silent reading. Pupil 16, on the

  Fic. 1.—Diagnostic chart of the reading accomplishment of thirteen pupils 
other hand, is much stronger in oral reading than in silent reading. Even 
more striking variations in achievement have been described by Buswell. 
(53) in his study of fundamental reading habits. Such findings make it 
perfectly clear that achievement in reading should be considered not in 
terms of gross scores on particular tests but rather in terms of achievement, 
in each of the important phases of reading. 
Differences in rate of progress —The fact that pupils differ widely in 
rate of progress is well illustrated by the results of studies which are 
summarized later in this chapter on pages 48-54, inclusive. Further 
more, training experiments, such as that of O’Brien (280) to increase the 
rate of reading and that of C. T. Gray (124) to increase comprehension , 
supply convincing evidence of differences in rate of progress. There jg 
need of additional studies to determine, more fully the nature of these
-P-A-G-E-53
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND RELATED PROBLEMS 45 
differences and to discover their causes. The general fact, however, that 
differences exist has been clearly established. School systems, therefore, 
are justified in introducing radical changes in class organization in order 
to provide adequately for these differences. 
PROVISIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
Provisions for individual differences in elementary schools —Since 
pupils differ widely in achievement and in rate of progress, it is important 
to determine the provisions which are made for such differences in teach- 
ing reading. An extensive study of this problem was made by Theisen, 
who secured from 118 teachers and supervisors information concerning 
methods of providing for individual needs. The replies are listed in 
Table XXIV (367: 562) under seven general headings. / 
The items in the table suggest a wide variety of practices. The 
validity of many of the suggestions should be determined experimentally, 
and the relative merits of others should be investigated. The value of 
‘some of them will be discussed more or less fully in the sections of the 
chapter that follow. Whatever the ultimate decision may be with regard 
to their validity, the results of Theisen’s study are very valuable. They 
present a much broader conception of the problem of providing for indi- 
vidual differences in reading classes than is found in the majority of 
classrooms today. 
RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE TO READING ACHIEVEMENT 
Statement of the problem.—One of the important questions which must 
be considered in providing for individual needs relates to the correlation 
of intelligence with achievement in reading. It is the purpose of this 
section to summarize the results of investigations concerned with correla- 
tions between mental capacity as measured by intelligence tests and read- 
ing achievement as measured by silent-reading tests. In the discussion 
that follows, the studies made among grade pupils, among pupils in 
special classes, and among college students will be discussed separately. 
Studies among grade pupils —True (386) made an elaborate study 
based on records from 218 pupils in Grades IV to VIII, inclusive. Three 
general intelligence tests and four silent-reading tests were used. They 
wete the Illinois Examination; the Otis Group Intelligence Scale; the 
Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Tests; the Monroe, Courtis, and 
Burgess silent-reading tests; and the silent-reading test in the Lllinois 
Examination. The correlations varied from —.10 to +.87. The mean 
correlation between the silent-reading records and the Terman intelligence

quotient was about 50, which indicates a fair degree of relationship. 
The general correlation was greatest in the fourth grade, was relatively

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND RELATED PROBLEMS 47 
group intelligence tests and the silent-reading tests than between the 
Stanford test and the reading tests. This was doubtless due to the fact 
that reading is required more or less largely in the group tests used. 
The results of other studies confirm the findings of True. For example, 
Madsen (250) gave a battery of tests to pupils in Grades V B, VIB, and 
VII B. The correlation between the scores on the Terman Group Test 
of Mental Ability, Form A, and the Thorndike Reading Scale, Alpha 2, 
was .53. Hilliard (rzo: 39) gave three intelligence tests and four reading 
tests to five fifth-grade classes. The correlations ranged from .38 to .go, 
with most of them above .60. Theisen (368) reported a correlation of .84 - 
for two hundred pupils in Grades I and IL between the Haggerty Intel- 
ligence Examination and the Haggerty Reading Examination, Sigma 1. 
In the case of 144 eighth-grade pupils, the coefficients were .65 for Test 1, 
.67 for Test 2, and .7o for the two tests combined. In another study, 
which included the VII B classes in fourteen schools, Theisen (370) found 
a correlation of .44 between comprehension as measured by the Monroe 
Standardized Silent Reading Test and intelligence as measured by the 
Mlinois intelligence test. In a study including several grades, Gates (103) 
found somewhat lower correlations, based on the results of two intelligence 
tests and five reading tests. They varied from —.o2 in the case of the 
Brown Silent Reading Test to -++.69 in the case of the Thorndike-McCall 
test. 
Studies among pupils in special classes.—Merrill (260) gave the 
Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Tests to 210 retarded pupils in 
Oakland, California. The correlation between the results of the intelli- 
gence tests and of each of the reading tests used follows:

Hewes and others (168) found in the case of 1,007 retarded pupils a 
correlation of .68 between mental age as determined by the Stanford 
Revision of the Binet-Simon Tests and attainment in reading as revealed 
by school records. 
Studies among college students ——Webb (407) reported the results of a 
study made in one of his psychology classes through the use of the Army 
Alpha Tests, two group tests devised by Thurstone, and the Monroe
-P-A-G-E-56
48 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Standardized Silent Reading Test for high-school pupils. The correlation 
between the various units of the Army test and comprehension varied 
from .17 to .68. In the case of the Thurstone tests the correlation ranged 
from .47 to .64. 
Tentative conclusions and problems for further study ——With very few 
exceptions, the studies to which reference has been made show a greater 
or less degree of positive correlation between general intelligence and 
reading achievement. It is in harmony with natural expectation that 
accomplishment in reading should vary with the level of intelligence of 
the learner. The fact that the coefficients vary widely is not so easily 
explained. When different reading and intelligence tests are used, varia- 
tions in coefficients of correlation may be due to the fact that somewhat 
different abilities are measured. At least, this problem merits additional 
study. Furthermore, there is need of investigations to determine the 
degree of correlation between intelligence and achievement when reading 
for different purposes. The fact that correlations vary widely among 
classes when the same tests are used suggests that pupils in different 
schools do not. approximate their maximum achievement to the same 
degree. At this stage in the study of the relation between intelligence 
and reading achievement it is very important that measures of the abilities 
involved be refined and that causes of variation in the degree of correla- 
tion be determined. 
GROUPING ON. THE BASIS OF INTELLIGENCE 
Statement of problem.—Since there is a positive relation between intel- 
ligence and reading achievement, it is natural to assume that pupils can 
be grouped to advantage for purposes of reading instruction on the basis 
of their intelligence. It is the purpose of this section to summarize the 
results of such experiments and to discuss their implications. 
Studies among primary pupils —In October, 1920, Theisen grouped 
992 first-grade pupils into bright, medium, and slow groups through the 
use of the Pressey primer scale. In the following May the children were 
tested with the Haggerty reading test for the primary grades. The 
average scores of the pupils in each of the three groups are presented in 
Table XXV (369: 531). This table shows clearly the more rapid progress 
of the pupils ranking highest on the intelligence test. 
Studies made by Oglesby (282) with X, Y, and Z classes in Detroit, 
Lowell (238), and Dickson (79) supply additional evidence of the superi~ 
ority of children of high intelligence. These studies also show that there 
is much overlapping in the achievement scores of bright, medium, and
-P-A-G-E-57
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND RELATED PROBLEMS 49 
slow pupils. For example, Oglesby (282: 60) found that in one class the 
overlapping was as follows: between X (bright) and Y (medium) pupils, 
7o per cent; between Y (medium) and Z (slow) pupils, 43 per cent; and 
between X (bright) and Z (slow) pupils, 30 per cent. 
These data indicate that there are factors other than intelligence 
which must be considered in teaching primary pupils. Oglesby suggested 
the following: ‘difference in health, in attendance, in the nationality of 
the pupils, in the attitude of the pupils toward school work, in the ability 
of the teacher, and in the quality of the materials and the methods of 
instruction” (282: 61). 
Studies among older pupils and college students.—Sangren reported a 
study in which pupils in ninth-grade English were classified in the autumn

of 1922 into three groups on the “basis of their scores on the Terman 
Group Test of Mental Ability.” All the pupils were tested both in the 
autumn and in the following spring with the Van Wagenen Reading Scale 
in English Literature. The results are presented in Table XXVI (328: 
548). This table shows that in the autumn the median achievement of 
the groups varied with the median intelligence scores. During the year 
the slow group made remarkable progress. No explanation of this fact 
is given in the report. If the difference in the autumn and spring scores 
of Group C represents genuine progress in achievement, we have clear 
evidence that there are factors other than intelligence, such as kind of 
instruction, motives for study, and attitude of Pupils, which affect 
progress in reading. 
Patrick reported the progress of a group of bright pupils from March,
-P-A-G-E-58
5° INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
1922, to April, 1923. This group was drawn chiefly from the fourth 
grade, with a few pupils from Grade III A. The chronological ages of 
the pupils varied from 94 to 122 months, and the mental ages varied from 
132 to 184 months. From September, 1921, to February, 1923, the 
methods employed “tended to produce acceleration, enrichment being

more or less incidental.” After the latter date, the methods were changed 
to provide for enrichment. Table XXVII (291: 264, 266) shows the quar- 
tile reading ages of the pupils studied as determined by the Thorndike- 
McCall Reading Scale. This table is interpreted by Patrick as follows: 
The median reading age in 1922 “corresponds to a median school grade of

7B, with 50 per cent of the scores lying between 7 B and the end of 8 A, 
while 16 per cent make scores corresponding to the median for 12 A.’? 
In 1923, “23 per cent (four pupils) . . . . made scores equal to or above 
the norm for ‘superior teachers.’ An additional 12 per cent (two 
pupils) . . . . made scores equal to or above high-r2th-grade norms, 
Only 35 per cent fell below the low-gth-grade norms.” These results
-P-A-G-E-59

supply striking evidence of the very remarkable progress of which bright 
pupils are capable. 
Concluding statements.—The studies referred to in this section show 
clearly that progress in reading depends to a considerable extent on the 
level of intelligence of the learner. It is clear that this factor must be 
taken into consideration in providing adequately for individual differ- 
ences, The fact that pupils at the same intelligence level do not advance 
equally rapidly shows that factors other than intelligence determine 
progress in reading. It follows, therefore, thad if pupils are classified on 
the basis of intelligence, careful studies must be made of important 
characteristics and needs of the pupils of each group and adequate provi- 
sion made for them. Ability grouping merely eliminates one variable and 
simplifies the problem of teaching. There is need of investigations to 
determine whether this is the most important variable to control or 
eliminate. There is also need of experiments to determine the most 
appropriate types of instruction for pupils at various levels of intelligence 
and at various levels of progress in school. 
GROUPING ON THE BASIS OF READING NEEDS 
Statement of problem—A second method of providing for individual 
differences is to group pupils for a time on the basis of their accomplish- 
ments.and to differentiate instruction according to the needs of the various 
groups. It is the purpose of this section to describe one such experiment 
and to summarize the results. 
An example of differentiated instruction—The experiment (89) was 
based on an effort to differentiate instruction in ninth-grade English. 
The study as a whole considered both reading and the mechanics of 
English. Attention will be given here only to the former. The reading 
sections were formed on the basis of scores made on the Monroe and the 
Haggerty silent-reading tests and on an informal rate and comprehension 
test. The comprehension scores on each test were assigned to four equal 
groups, and a rank of 1, 2, 3, or 4 was given to each score. The ranks of 
each pupil in the three tests were then added to secure comprehension 
indexes. Grouping was accomplished by putting into Section C pupils 
who read fewer than 20 pages in a half-hour and “who ranked moderately 
low in comprehension.” Section A included rapid readers “who were also 
unusually strong in comprehension.” Section B included those not in 
Section A or Section C. 
The instruction given to the three groups differed widely in character. 
Section C received intensive help on such matters as rate and accuracy of
-P-A-G-E-60
52 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
oral reading, pronunciation, enunciation, syllabication, accent, diacritical 
marks, the use of the dictionary, speed of silent reading, and habits of 
thoughtful reading with emphasis on specific study habits. Section A 
was given opportunity to read widely materials relating to their interests. 
Attention was directed pritnarily to the content rather than to literary 
or artistic qualities. Group B presented the most serious problem, for it 
contained pupils who needed various types of help. For example, some 
pupils needed wide reading of simple content material to promote speed; 
others needed training in careful reading to overcome carelessness and 
inattention to content. 
The training continued from October to February. When the tests 
were repeated, the following results were revealed: (r) all sections in- 
creased their rate. (2) Sections B and C gained in comprehension, while 
Section A lost. In commenting on the results of the experiment, the report 
states, “Pupils who cannot read very simple expository prose under- 
standingly and economically have been spared the farce of studying 
classics far beyond their powers of comprehension. .. . . If the objection 
be raised that this ninth grade was not taught literature, the reply is 
that the only group ready for literature as it is usually taught was given 
a half-year course in belles lettres and that all of the groups were reading 
materials and using reading methods which approximate the needs of 
everyday life” (89: 788). 
Concluding statemenis—This study demonstrates two advantages of 
instruction differentiated on the basis of needs: first, appropriate instruc- 
tion in fundamental reading habits for all pupils who need such help with- 
out retarding those who are prepared for more advanced work; second, 
differentiation in the content and in the quantitative and qualitative 
requirements according to the preparation and needs of the pupils. The 
study shows, however, that grouping on the basis of reading needs merely 
simplifies the problem of providing for individual differences; it does not 
eliminate it. There is need of similar experiments at various levels of 
progress to determine the conditions under which differentiation can take 
place to best advantage, the distinguishing characteristics of groups to 
which pupils may be assigned, and the kind and amount of instruction 
best suited to the needs of each group. 
PROVIDING VARIED ACTIVITIES FOR THE PUPILS OF A 
GIVEN CLASS 
Statement of problem.—A third procedure which has been adopted in 
providing for individual differences is to assign varied activities to the
-P-A-G-E-61
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND RELATED PROBLEMS 53 
pupils of a given class on the basis of their needs. The example which 
follows supplies convincing evidence of the value of this plan. 
An example of varied activities for a fourth-grade class —When Guilfoile 
(1g0) tested a class of forty-three fourth-grade children in November by 
means of the Monroe Silent Reading Test, it was found that the class as 
a whole “ranked lower than the third-grade standard in comprehension 
and barely attained the third-grade standard in rate.” Furthermore, 
the results showed that the pupils were poorly classified with respect 
to reading ability. “Six children could do only second-grade work. 
At the other extreme, two children made better than sixth-grade 
records.” 
The low average of the class was attributed to the following facts: 
The class ranked lowest in intelligence among the fourth-grade classes of 
the city; eight pupils were border-line cases, and there was no special 
room to which to assign them; five pupils had entered the fourth grade 
from Grade ITI A of another school, where semiannual promotions were 
employed; eight negro children had inadequate vocabularies; the most 
common fault was word-reading accompanied by lip-movement; the 
entire class lacked power of concentration; many pupils lacked an ade- 
quate literary basis for the usual fourth-grade material; their chief 
difficulties in oral reading were poor articulation, carelessness, and physi- 
cal defects, such as adenoids, diseased tonsils, and poor vision. 
The corrective steps taken will be summarized briefly. (x) A com- 
mittee of ten pupils went to the library with the teacher to select books 
covering a wide range of interest and difficulty. (2) A library club was 
organized. (3) About sixty books were kept on a library table in the class- 
room for daily use. (4) During the recitation period the class was divided 
into two groups. The poor readers, who included one-third of the class, 
were given oral reading or individual help by the teacher. The remainder 
of the pupils selected books to read and enjoy independently. (5) All 
pupils were given frequent opportunity to read in an audience situation 
after fifteen minutes of preparation. (6) A record was kept of the diffi- 
culties of each pupil, and constructive suggestions were offered. As a 
result, the pupils endeavored to overcome many different weaknesses. 
No pupil was given help outside the reading period. 
The Monroe test was repeated January 11. “Whereas in November 
the class as a whole fell below the third-grade standard in comprehension 
and barely attained the third-grade standard in rate, the group now fell 
only one point short of the fourth-grade standard in comprehension and 
went slightly above the fourth-grade average in rate.” Other valuable
-P-A-G-E-62
54 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
results were reported, such as forming the library habit, learning to care 
for books, learning to distinguish a good book from a poor book, and 
finding a new world to explore independently. 
Concluding statements-~There were no control groups in this experi- 
ment, and there is no evidence that some of the progress was not due to 
practice in taking the Monroe test. Nevertheless, the experiment demon- 
strates the fact that provision can be made to meet individual needs even 
in a class of forty-three. It is an open question whether the procedure 
adopted by this teacher is more economical and effective than the method 
of grouping pupils into classes on the basis of reading needs or intelligence. 
This experiment, as well as the two preceding experiments relating to 
grouping on the basis of reading needs, shows clearly that, no matter 
how classes are organized, the achievements and needs of pupils must be 
+ studied carefully and that teachers must ever be on the alert if all pupils 
are to make rapid and satisfactory progress.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE MERITS OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF TEACHING 
BEGINNING READING 
Statement of the problem —The selection of a method of teaching 
beginning reading presents a problem of practical significance and merits , 
intensive study. Three types of studies have been made of the relative 
merits of various methods of teaching beginning reading, namely, tests 
of the achievements of pupils taught by different methods, experiments 
to determine the merits of particular methods, and analyses of the achieve- 
ment records, progress, and difficulties of pupils. It is the purpose of this 
chapter to summarize the results of these studies and to point out the 
conclusions which they justify. , 
TESTS OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF PUPILS 
Number and types of studies —The method used most widely in efforts 
to determine the merits of different methods of teaching beginning reading 
has been to test groups of pupils taught by various methods and to com- 
pare the results. Such investigations have been made in this country 
by Bliss (31), Gray (131), Harris and Anderson (158), Hendricks (163), 
Theisen (368), and Waldo (40x), and in England by Ballard (13), Gill 
(117), Hassall and Varley (159), and Valentine (392). Some of these 
investigations are of very little value. The remainder may be classified 
into two groups for the purpose of this discussion. The first group includes 
studies made in a small number of schools, the results of which suggest the 
superiority of particular methods. The second group includes much more 
extensive investigations. The data show that a given method does not 
always secure the most satisfactory results. 
Investigations which suggest the superiority of particular methods— 
Harris and Anderson (158) gave tests to determine the efficiency of the 
Beacon, the Horace Mann, and the Aldine systems of primary reading. 
The results of the tests in both oral reading and silent reading showed 
that the pupils taught by the Beacon system had made the most satis- 
factory progress. However, there was no evidence to show that the 
superiority should be attributed to the specific type of training given 
rather than to differences in the capacity of pupils to learn, in the skill 
of teachers, or in other conditions affecting each group.
-P-A-G-E-64
56 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Hassall and Varley (159) determined the reading rates and the nature 
of the mistakes of eighty-five children in School A who had been taught by 
the sentence method and of sixty children in School B whose attention 
had been directed’ to the content but who were taught the “phonic 
analysis of both spoken and ‘printed words.” The test consisted of. a 
story which the children had neither seen nor heard before. As each pupil 
read, the head’ mistress recorded the time consumed in reading and the 
errors. With regard to rate of reading, the results showed distinct 
superiority and wider variation in School A than in School B. Each group 
contained approximately the same proportion of pupils who read words 
as wholes and who sounded the letters. Nine out of eighty-five pupils-in 
School A analyzed words, although this method was discouraged in class 
teaching. Six out of sixty pupils in School B sounded words; in addition, 
fifteen spelled them in the conventional way. 
Hendricks (163) gave tests to determine whether pupils who-had been 
trained by the Rational Method could read as well as, or better than, 
"pupils trained in schools where no specific system of technique was used. 
The results showed that the pupils who were taught by the Rational . 
Method were superior both in rate of reading and in comprehension. 
Inasmuch, however, as the second group had followed no specific method, 
itvis ‘possible that the results merely indicated the superiority of a well. 
organized method of teaching reading as compared with a poorly organ= 
ized method. 
'” Gill (117) reports the results of an investigation made j in England . 
_ to determine the relative efficiency of three methods, namely, the Dale 
‘Phonic Method (X) with slight modifications, a phonetic method (¥) 
in which the “forms of the letters had been made attractive to the children 
by ingenious, but irrelevant, associations,” and a “thought” or “sentence”? 
method. (Z). Three groups of children from different schools were tested. 
These groups will be referred to as Group X, Y, or Z, according to the 
method used. Groups X and Y had been learning to read for two years 
and-Group Z for sixteen months. Two simple paragraphs of equal length 
were used for the test. They weré printed without punctuation or spacing, 
In the case of one of the paragraphs the initial letters of nouns were printed 
in capitals. Records were made of the time consumed in reading and of 
comprehension. The time required in the case of Groups X and Y. was 
more than double the time required by Group Z, “who in fluency and L 
‘intelligence of reading also were equally superior.”* 
Valentine (392), whose experimental work will be reported later, 
pointed out. the following criticisms with regard to Gill’s investigation,
-P-A-G-E-65
MERITS OF METHODS OF BEGINNING READING 57 
the first two of which apply also to the other investigations which have 
been ‘discussed: (1) No evidence was given concerning the comparative 
intelligence of the children of the three schools mentioned. (2) The 
quality of the teaching in the three schools was not discussed. Gill stated, 
however, that the new method had been introduced in the school which 
' contained Group Z and suggested that the teachers in this school were 
probably alert and progressive beyond the average. (3) The reading of 
passages in which the words were run together probably favored Group 
Z, which had been taught to read sentence-wholes. 
The results of the four investigations which have-been reported lead 
to conflicting conclusions. In two cases phonetic methods secured the 
better results, and in two other cases thought methods proved to be 
superior. Inasmuch as the conditions under which the children learned 
to read were not controlled, it is possible that the results of these investi- 
gations do not indicate the relative merits of the methods of teaching __ 
which were described. Additional evidence in support of this view is 
presented in the section which follows. 
Investigations which reveal wide variations in the results of particular 
methods.—In ‘an ‘effort to determine which phorietic system is the most 
effective, Theisen (368) measured with the Haggerty reading tests. the 
achievement of seventy first- and second- -grade classes in fifteen school 
. systems using ten different methods of primary reading. Records of 
pupils were excluded “who had been present less than 130 days, who were 
transferred from other schools, or who had not had the advantage’ of 
kindergarten training.” Thé results of this investigation were summa- 
rized by Theisen as follows: 
Although reports were received from forty-one first-grade and twenty-ninie 
second-grade classes, the numbers were insufficient to warrant final conclusions. 
Not all of the good nor all of the poor records were confined to classes ‘trained 
in any one of the phonic systems... . . The system which produced the best 
class record in the first grade produced another that was among the poorest 
three. Two of the four best records were made by classes not reared by any 
of the commercialized systems, but on adaptations arranged by the teacher or 
the supervisor in charge [368¢ 14]. 
. Similar results were obtained in a study (31) to determine whether 
the Aldine or the Ward method secured the more effective results in rate 
and accuracy of otal reading.’ Of the forty-four schools tested, twenty-six 
. used the Aldine method; seventeen used the Ward method; and one school 
used a method of its own. Differences in method were not accompanied by 
uniform differences in accomplishment, The average score for each of the
-P-A-G-E-66
58 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
two groups was approximately the same. A study of the records of individ- 
ual schools showed that of the schools which ranked highest in the primary 
grades, some had used the Ward method and some the Aldine method. Of 
the schools which ranked lowest,,some had used the Ward method and 
some the Aldine. 
These investigations show quite clearly that a given method does not 
always secure equally satisfactory results. They support the current 
belief that there are factors other than the specific method employed, 
such as the skill of the teacher, the economic level of the pupils, their 
nationality, and their capacity to learn, which must be considered in 
determining the causes of success or failure in primary reading. Addi- 
tional evidence in support of this view is presented in the next section. 
There is need at the present time of carefully controlled experiments to 
determine the conditions under which given methods secure the best: 
results. 
EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE MERITS OF PARTICULAR METHODS 
Types of studies.—Two experiments have been reported from England 
which wére carried on for the specific purpose of determining the relative 
merits of phonetic and the Look-and-Say methods of teaching reading. 
One experiment has been made in this country to determine the effective- 
ness of the Detroit Standard Practice Tests in Reading. 
The Dale Phonic Method versus the Look-and-Say Method. —Dumville 
(85) organized an experiment to determine the reading time and errors 
of older children when taught by the Dale Phonic Method and the Look- 
and-Say Method to read with a new alphabet, namely, that of the Associa~ 
tion Phonetique Internationale. Thirty-six pupils from Standard Seven of 
an elementary school were divided into two equal groups, and twenty- 
five pupils from Form VI of a secondary school were divided into two 
approximately equal groups. Thirty minutes were devoted to learning by 
each of the elementary-school groups and twenty-five minutes by each 
of the secondary-school groups. The methods of learning were as follows: 
_ The members of the Look-and-Say Section were each given a list of all the - 
words occurring in the text, printed in phonetic transcript, in irregular order, 
and with ordinary spelling opposite. They were told to learn the new forms as 
wholes, going over them again and again in order to be able to recognize and 
name them at a glance. They were also told the nature of the test awaiting 
them and wére recommended to continue running over the words in order to 
increase their speed. The Phonic Section were also told the nature of the test 
awaiting them, But they were prepared for it by having the powers or sounds 
of the symbols imparted to them. It was pointed out that many’of the sym-
-P-A-G-E-67
MERITS OF METHODS OF BEGINNING READING 59 
bols would be the same as in ordinary spelling but that the new ones re- 
quired special attention. And a table indicating clearly the sound correspond- 
ing to each new symbol, and giving a sample word in phonetic transcript 
containing the symbol in question, was handed to each pupil [85: 412]. 
The results of the experiment were determined by two tests: The 
first contained only words previously presented to the pupils; the second 
contained many new combinations of the same sounds. The records 
showed superior results in rate and accuracy for the two Look-and-Say 
sections on the first test and for the Look-and-Say elementary section 
and the phonetic secondary section on the second test. In commenting 
on the results of the tests, Dumville said that if analysis had not taken 
place ‘‘in the minds of the ‘Look-and-Say’ pupils,” their results would have 
been hopelessly inferior to those of the pupils in the phonetic sections. 
Furthermore, he pointed out the fact that the pupils who were taught by 
the phonetic method probably soon began to learn words by the Look- 
and-Say Method. These results may be interpreted to mean that the 
exclusive use of either method may not be as effective as an appropriate 
combination of the two. \entiee 
A phonetic method versus the Look-and-Say Method —Valentine (392) 
conducted an experiment with two groups of college students, twenty- 
four in each group, to secure evidence with regard to the relative value 
of a phonetic method and the Look-and-Say method of teaching reading. 
Each class studied for two minutes, according to carefully planned direc- 
tions, a passage of English prose written in Greek letters. Three tests 
were then given, including both seen and unseen words. The phonetic 
group made distinctly superior scores. Two additional experiments based 
on only five Greek characters were organized, one with a group of children 
who had been learning to read for only a year. The results indicated 
distinct superiority of the phonetic method. An analysis of the records 
of individual pupils showed that “with the lower halves of the classes 
‘the Look-and-Say Method’ proved almost as effectual as, or even more 
. effectual than, the Phonic Method in the seen work, though less effective 
as a rule in the unseen.” . 
The experiments of Dumville and Valentine do not lead to final 
conclusions concerning the value of phonetic methods of teaching reading. 
They are open to the criticism that they did not include either normal 
reading situations or real tests of reading achievement. It is possible that 
the methods which are the most effective in teaching pupils who have 
learned to read to recognize unfamiliar isolated symbols may not be the 
most effective in teaching children to read English sentences. Never- 92)
-P-A-G-E-68
60 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
theless, these experiments suggest two facts which are of wide signifi- 
cance. The first is that pupils taught by one method made use of habits 
emphasized in the other. It is possible, therefore, that a combination of 
the two methods would be more effective than the exclusive use of either 
one. The second fact is that the two methods differed somewhat in effec- 
tiveness for pupils of superior and inferior intelligence. This suggests that 
possibly the use of various methods which can be adapted to the needs 
and capacities of pupils will be far more effective than the universal use 
of a given method for all pupils. 
The Detroit practice tests versus another method of teaching beginning 
reading.—Smith (346) reports the results of an experiment in which “the 
Detroit Standard Practice Tests in Reading were used as a method of 
teaching reading to beginning first-grade children.” This method was 
used with 180 beginning first-grade pupils in Detroit during a period of 
five months. For each class using the practice tests there was a control _ 
class using “another method.” The control groups and the experimental 
groups were equivalent in the following respects: “type of school, ability 
of teacher (as nearly as it was possible to judge), number, age, intelligence, 
nationality, previous training, and type of children and the amount of 
time devoted to reading.” The pupils were tested at the beginning of the 
experiment with the Detroit Group Vocabulary Test, and the records of 
those pupils were disregarded who were able to recognize any words. 
Throughout the experiment the teacher kept a record of the number 
of books and pages read by each pupil. At the end of the semester the 
pupils were tested with the Gray Oral Reading Test, the Haggerty 
Achievement Examination in Reading, Sigma 1, the Detroit Group Vo- 
cabulary Test, and the Detroit Story Picture Test. With regard to the 
amount of reading, the tabulations showed that the experimental group 
varied from three to thirty-two books while the control group varied 
from one to four books. The results of the tests are shown in Table 
XXVIII (346: 49). 
The data in the table supply striking evidence of the superiority 
of the methods used with the experimental groups. Unfortunately, no 
information is given concerning the methods employed in the control 
groups. Furthermore, the fact should be recalled that the experimental 
groups read much more than the control groups. This implies that tech- 
niques were used other than those which belong to the practice tests. 
It is therefore impossible to determine whether the superior results at- 
tained by the experimental groups should be attributed primarily to the 
use of the practice tests, to techniques employed in securing independent
-P-A-G-E-69

reading, or to the large amount of reading which the pupils did. The 
experiment as reported might more properly have been called, ‘An Ex- 
periment to Determine the Effectiveness of the Detroit Method of Teach- 
ing Reading during the First Semester.”

  ANALYTICAL STUDIES OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS, PROGRESS, 
AND DIFFICULTIES OF PUPILS 
Importance of analytical studies —Without doubt, the most valuable 
studies of methods of teaching beginning reading which have been made 
‘are those which make detailed analyses of the achievements, progress, 
and difficulties of pupils taught by different methods. The virtue of this 
type of investigation lies in the fact that it secures specific evidence of the 
advantages and limitations of each method studied. The two studies of 
this type which have been reported show clearly that contrasting methods 
secure different results in various elements of reading. 
A detailed laboratory study —A very significant study has been reported 
by Buswell (53), who photographed the eye-movements and secured 
phonographic records of the oral reading of two groups of children at 
different stages of progress during the first year of school. One group was 
taught by a method which emphasized word recognition. 
Elaborate phonetic drill was provided in a separate period. Sufficient drill 
was given to secure great independence in the recognition of words. In teaching 
a new selection, the teacher first told the story in her own words in order to 
stimulate an attitude of interest on the part of the pupils. Next she wrote the 
new words on the board, drilling the children on them as she proceeded. .. . . 
After all the new words had been studied, the pupils read the selection orally. 
Following the oral reading, they were drilled in finding certain sentences or 
lines [53: 63]. 
In the case of the second group, attention was given to developing a 
correct reading attitude, to securing meaningful experiences from the
-P-A-G-E-70
62 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
printed matter, and to creating a desire to read by providing interesting 
content. 
The method proceeded from the whole story to lines and phrases, and 
finally to individual word-study. The word-study was not given major con- 
sideration but was subordinated to the development of a proper reading atti- 
tude [53: 63]. 
The B section of each group was tested during the seventh, thirteenth, 
and seventeenth weeks of the school year. Records were also secured from 
the I A pupils at the same time. Owing to the fact that they had already 
attended school one semester, “‘their records were secured after a school 
experience of twenty-five, thirty-one, and thirty-five weeks. This method 
gave records at six intervals during the first school year.” A detailed 
analysis of the records led to the following conclusions concerning the 
results of the methods which were used. 
If the primary emphasis is placed on word-recognition, the outcome is the 
ability to follow the printed lines, to pronounce all the words, but to display 
no vital concern for the coritent. It produces what is familiarly called word. 
reading. This is not the complete attitude of the mature reader. The method 
goes far in the development of word-recognition, an element which all pupils 
must ultimately develop. It leaves much to be done in securing an attitude of 
reading by thought-wholes. 
On the other hand, when the chief emphasis is placed on the thought and 
the story is memorized, the pupils do develop a vital concern for the content, 
but develop more slowly in word-recognition and in ability to follow the lines 
[s3: 72]. 
A classroom study. _Fssentially the same conclusions were reached 
by Currier and Duguid, who followed two first-grade classes and two 
second-grade classes throughout a year. Significant differences between 
the phonetic and non-phonetic groups were described as follows: 
The phonic classes so concentrated upon letter sounds that the attention 
was diverted from the sense of the paragraph to word pronunciation. This 
brought about lack of interest and fatigue and destroyed the pleasure which the 
story should yield. The reading was generally less smooth, slower, and the 
idea confused. 
The classes having no phonics were found to enjoy reading for the sake of 
the study... .. They were less careful and less correct than the phonic classes 
in regard to word pronunciation. Keeping the sense in mind, they often substi- 
tuted words from their own vocabulary for difficult or unfamiliar words in the 
text. They read more swiftly and with more expression [74: 286]. 
The results of the two studies that have been summarized show that 
thought methods and phonetic methods emphasize different phases of
-P-A-G-E-71
MERITS OF METHODS OF BEGINNING READING 63 
reading. As a result, pupils start toward maturity in reading over some- 
what different routes. The exclusive use of either method results in the 
neglect of habits that are cultivated by the other. Ultimately, pupils 
should become mature in all phases of reading. 
Concluding statements —The studies to which reference has been made 
do not supply conclusive evidence of the relative merits of different 
methods of teaching beginning reading. They do indicate, however, that 
contrasting methods emphasize different elements of reading and that 
probably a combination of the effective phases of various methods 
would prove more valuable than the exclusive use of any of the methods 
that have been experimentally studied. Furthermore, experiments indi- 
cate that some methods may prove mére effective with certain types of 
children than with others. There is urgent need of a series of analytical 
studies and experiments to determine the elements of strength and weak- 
ness in each method in current use, the conditions under which it proves 
most effective, and the types of pupils for which it is best adapted.

CHAPTER Ix 
FUNDAMENTAL HABITS OF RECOGNITION IN SILENT 
AND ORAL READING 
Purpose.—Investigators have distinguished five habits, or groups of 
habits, relating to recognition that are essential in both silent and oral 
reading. These are usually designated as follows: accuracy of recognition, 
a wide span of recognition, speed of recognition, rhythmical progress of 
perceptions along the lines, and accurate return sweeps from the end of 
one line to the beginning of the next. It is the purpose of this chapter to 
summarize the results of investigations that contribute information 
concerning the nature of these habits and the conditions that favor their 
-development. : : 
ACCURACY OF RECOGNITION 
Nature of perceptual ability in reading fEvery teacher of reading 
faces the problem of training pupils to recognize words accurately and- 
independently, )One of the important questions which arise in this con- 
nection relates to the nature of perceptual ability in reading. In an inten- 
sive study of defects in vision and visual perception among children, Gates 
(104: 20-37) secured evidence which led to two significant conclusions. 
, First, “there is no“general perceptual ability’ but many relatively specific 
abilities for specific items,” such as words, digits, and letters. Second, 
poor performance is to be explained in terms of specific causes or defects 
rather than in terms of defects or deficiencies in “general perceptual 
ability.” These facts are illustrated in the descriptions that follow of the 
habits of good readers, the difficulties encountered by poor readers, and 
the types of errors made by pupils in the primary grades. 
Facts concerning recognition among good readers—In a detailed discus— 
sion of perceptual processes in reading, Huey (185: 102-16) emphasized 
the fact that in the case of many mature readers the general form or 
outline of the word is a sufficient cue to its recognition. The cue given by 
the context “tips the balance in favor of the unitary recognition of the 
word..... With very familiar words, the letter recognitions are checke@ 
in their incipiency. With new words, the recognition of certain letters 
may quite complete itself before the whole word is known.” It is evident, 
therefore, “that we read by phrases, words, or letters, as we may serve 
our purpose best.” Huey emphasized the fact, however, that there are 
- 6
-P-A-G-E-73
FUNDAMENTAL HABITS OF RECOGNITION 65 
very great individual differences, based, in part at least, “on the methods 
by which the reader has learned to read.” 
Hamilton came to similar conclusions as a result of laboratory studies 
in which both children and adults served as subjects. (He found that in a 
' majority of cases the general characteristics of a word are the cues by 
which it is recognized, : 
But when some unfavorable condition arises or when the words are strange 
or difficult, additional distinctions within the word are required, in which case 
the parts of the word must be brought more or less clearly to consciousness, 
according to the degree of complexity or unfamiliarity... . . The form of 
procedure may therefore be described as predominantly synthetic-analytic, the 
amount of analysis tending in general to decrease with, growth in-ability and 
with increasing familiarity with the material read [rg5: 52-53]. 
These findings make it clear that the good reader uses a variety of 
habits in recognizing words and that his efficiency is due, in part at least, 
to the use of specific habits which enable him to recognize new or difficult 
words quickly, accurately, and independently. 
. Difficulties encountered by poor readers.—In an analytical study of eye- 
movement records of children, Judd (204: 58-65) found that poor readers _ 
recognized some words quickly and accurately during single fixations. 
Other sections of the records of the same readers revealed serious diffi- 
culties and periods of confusion. In commenting ‘on one third-grade record, ~. 
Judd said, “The child is evidently compelled to make the greatest efforts 
before he can master the words. He moves his eyes about, restlessly 
trying, by getting different views, to recognize the complex of letters.” 
The need for training in the orderly analysis of words was emphasized 
in the following terms: 
We have found grounds in earlier records for the s ment that training 
enlarges the unit of recognition. We have here come ogevidence which shows 
us the necessity of teaching analysis. There is a neo in many cases for a 
smaller unit than the word. Unless the school trains the pupil to work out his 
words systematically, he will do it badly and will exhibit confusion [204: 60]. 
In a detailed study of the habits and errors of children in reading, 
Gates secured additional evidence of deficiencies in word recognition. 
Two of his conclusions follow: 
(1) The poor readers seem to react to the word vaguely as a whole, or to 
react chiefly to certain parts of a word (usually the first part) or at least fail 
to perceive certain significant features of words; and (2) the poor readers 
usually have no satisfactory method of attacking a new or difficult word. Many 
of them were quite helpless when they could not recognize the. word correctly 
at a glance [104: 43].

Types of errors or inaccuracies in recognition.—Many types of errors 
which occur frequently in learning to read were distinguished in two 
studies made among primary pupils. McGrath secured stenographic les- 
son reports of twenty-five recitations in first-grade reading and tabulated 
all the errors. The types of errors‘and the percentage of each are shown in 
Table XXIX (245: 39). So far as the recognition of words is concerned, . 
the errors may be grouped under six headings: _non-recognitions, total 
mispronunciations, partial mispronunciations, omissions,. substitutions, 
and insertions, : : ‘

Anderson and Merton tabulated the errors made by pupils in the 
third-grade classes of four schools when passages from the Gray Oral 
Reading Test were read. Their results appear in Table XXX (s:'685). 
It is apparent that they used a classification of errors somewhat different 
from that adopted by McGrath. The tables show, however, that the 
dominant types of errors differed in the two grades. For example, the 
most frequent errors in the first grade were non-recognitions, meaningful - 
substitutions, partial mispronunciations, and total mispronunciations. In 
the third grade substitutions, repetitions, and insertions were most fre-~ 
quent. These comparisons make it clear that many types of inaccuracy 
occur in recognition in the primary grades and that the character of the 
errors changes from grade to grade. Ultimately, pupils should recognize 
accurately and independently all the words of the passages that they read.

FUNDAMENTAL HABITS OF RECOGNITION 67 
Aids to accurate recognition.—The foregoing discussion shows clearly 
that aids to recognition are essential. It is the purpose of the discussion 
that follows to summarize the résults of investigations which relate to 
_ factors or conditions that contribute to accuracy of recognition, . Vo + 1. The meaning or context.—The value of the context as an aid in 
word recognition has been clearly demonstrated in a number of experi 
ments. For example, Boggs (35) conducted an experiment to determine 
the number of times each of the following had to be shown to a child 
before it was recognized: a letter of the Greek alphabet, a meaningless

syllable, a word with definite content, and a sentence. In all cases the 
sentence was grasped more quickly than any other unit. Hamilton (155) 
presented material to children in four different arrangements, “which 
may be designated as (1) whole paragraphs, (2) miscellaneous sentences, 
(3) miscellaneous phrases, and (4) miscellaneous words.” The children 
‘were trained individually, each child being given ten trials, one trial each 
day for ten days. The time of each reading was recorded with a stop- 
watch, “With two or three minor exceptions, the reading time throughout 
was diminished consistently with the increasing organization of the 
material.” In an analytical study of errors in recognition, Bowden found 
that the children learned to recognize nouns and adjectives more quickly 
than they learned to recognize other parts of speech. “This would seen:
-P-A-G-E-76
68 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
to indicate that the content of a word and its use in the sentence are 
factors which influence the ease with which it is learned” (37: 26). 
Numerous experiments (134) with more mature subjects show that individ- 
uals learn to recognize words more quickly when the words are associated 
‘with content than when they are presented in isolation. We are justified 
in concluding, therefore, that accuracy of recognition is greatly facilitated 
by presenting words in meaningful situations and by concentrating 
attention on the content of what is read. The investigations of Buswell 
(g3: 58-105) and of Currier (73) show clearly, however, that the context 
has serious limitations as a sole means of recognition. 
2. Total form of words—In a series of experiments with five children 
who had been léarning to read for six weeks, Bowden (397: 29-32) first 
presented words right side up and five minutes later presented them ~ 
upside down. Three of the children did not notice the change; the other 
two did. Bowden concluded that “it would seem that the child sees the 
word as a, whole and recognizes it upside down, just as he would recognize 
a toy upside down.” In a second experiment the letters of the word were 
shifted, but the general form of the word was preserved; for example, 
“mittens” was changed to “nettims.” This change disturbed the children 
little more than inverting the word. In a third experiment a letter not 
in the word was substituted for one in the word; for example, “dihac” for 
‘dilac.” The percentage of mutilations read as words was 42.6, as compared. 
with 75.9 per cent in the case of the words with shifted letters. In mutila- 
tions affecting the length or contour of the word, such as “‘coast” for 
“cat” or “fed” for “red,” the percentage of recognitions fell “to 37.4 for 
length and 30.7 for contour.” The conclusion to which these experiments 
led was that “the children saw the words as wholes and, while not con- 
scious of the position of the parts, were conscious of their presence or 
absence.” It follows that the general form of words plays a more or less 
important part in their early recognition. Huey also points out the fact 
that “the context ‘set’ for words tips the balance in favor of the unitary 
recpfnition of the word” (185: 113). 
3.» Length of words.--Conflicting evidence’ has been reported concern- 
ing the influefice of the length ofthe word on recognition. For example, 
Bowden found that the length of the word was.not a very significant 
factor, with but one exception. “In the case of ‘E’ the figures show that 
the short words and the long words were most readily learned and that 
the words of five letters gave most difficulty” (37: 28-29). She explains 
her results as due, in part at least, to the fact that “there was not variety 
enough in the length of the drill words.” Gates and Boeker (106: 472-74),
-P-A-G-E-77
FUNDAMENTAL HABITS OF RECOGNITION 69 
on the other hand, found that “long words are harder to learn than short 
words,” other things being equal. ‘‘There are, however, differences in 
difficulty among words of the same length when learned in the same list 
at the same time. Factors other than lehgth influence the ease of learn- 
ing.” The fact should be pointed out that in each of these experiments’ 
the words were presented in isolation. In all probability, the influence of 
the length of words would have been even less noticeable if the words 
had been presented in context. 
4. Special forms of words—Early psychologists (37: 26-28) divided 
words into four groups on’ the basis of form: “Tinear,”. such as “saw,” 
with all letters of the sanie height; “superlinear, ” such as “shell,” with 
letters extending above the line; “sublinear,” such as “going,” with 
letters extending below the line; “‘superlinear and sublinear,” with letters 
extending both above and below the line. It was maintained that words 
belonging to these classes differ widely in ease ‘of recognition. For 
example, Messmer said that “the linear words are less easily recognized 
because the contour is unbroken.” So far as young children are concerned, 
this classification is of very little significance. Bowden found that “four 
of the six children learned more of the linear words than of the other 
groups” (37: 28). Very few sublinear words were included in the study. 
“Tn only one case were the superlinear words, which Messmer holds to 
be more easily recognized, learned more readily than those of any other 
group.” Gates and Boeker also failed to find any “type of word shape - 
which is consistently easy or hard to learn” (106: 476). 
Words have also been classified (37: 28) according to the type of 
line of which the letters of the word are made. Thus, Messmer “speaks 
of letters of straight lines, like and f; letters of curved lines, like o 
and s; letters of curved and straight lines, like d and #; and letters of 
oblique lines, like w and y.” He maintained that words of straight 
lines have no distinctive features and are, therefore, least easily recog- 
nized. The results of the studies by Bowden and Gates give little or no 
support to Messmer’s claim. In fact, Bowden found that in the case of 
the words which she presented the children learned to recognize most 
easily those of straight lines. 
\ 5. Similarities in words.—It is a widely recognized fact that words 
which are similar in form, such as “man” and “mat,” are frequently 
confused by trained readers. Gates and-Boeker did not find this notice- 
ably true in the case of beginners. “It appears that ‘hen’ is confused equal- 
ly often with ‘man’ and ‘box,’ while ‘pen’ is confused with ‘pig’ and ‘rat’ 
as often as with ‘hen.’ ” They did find, however, that “there appears a
-P-A-G-E-78
7° INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
tendency for words having a similar ending to be mistaken for each other; 
similarities in the middle or beginning have no calculable effect” (106: 
477-82). 
6. Detailed features of words:—Bowden and Gates and Boeker secured 
striking evidence of the fact that children learn to recognize words by 
noting detailed characteristics of the words. “For example, six children - 
reported that they know ‘pig’ by means of the dot over the 7. Four 
children learned to recognize ‘box’ by means of the ‘funny cross’ at the 
end; three said they would know ‘window’ because the beginning was 
like the end” (106: 482). Bowden found that “it may be the length of * 
the word, the initial letter, the final letter, a characteristic letter, the ~ 
position of the word in the sentence, or even the blackness of the type. 
that serves as a cue” (37: 32). These facts make it clear that, while the 
general outline of words is important in recognition, words are often 
recognized in the case of young children by small or trivial details. 
7. Ability to perceive the details of words.—The fact that many children - 
distinguish words by means of detailed characteristics suggests that 
ability to perceive the details of words is a very important factor in learn- 
ing to read. This view finds justification in the results of Gates’s study 
(104: 20-37) to determine defects of vision and visual perception. By 
means of partial and multiple correlations Gates found an ability or 
abilities “common to all perceptual tests involving words as materials, 
sufficient to cause fairly high correlations between them. By hypothesis, 
this common factor is defined as an ability to perceive clearly the signifi- 
cant details of words” (104: 37). 
.. 8, Phonetics —The investigations of Buswell (53) and Currier and 
Duguid (74), summarized on pages 61-63, showed clearly that training in 
phonetics contributes to fluency and accuracy in word recognition. One 
of its virtues, so far as oral reading is concerned, lies in the fact that the 
phonetic analysis of words provides cues to their pronunciation. These 
cues have constant value and can be used repeatedly in determining the 
pronunciation of phonetic words. The studies which have been made, 
however, indicate that certain disadvantages and questions attach to the 
use of phonetics. 
In the first place, both Buswell and Currier found that pupils taught 
by phonetic methods frequently direct their attention primarily to the 
recognition of words and fail to interpret well what they read or to develop 
a vital concern for the content. Furthermore, Gates (104: 43) found that 
many pupils who had been given “one or another type of phonetic drill” 
were unable to deal successfully with new ox difficult words. He was led,
-P-A-G-E-79
FUNDAMENTAL HABITS OF RECOGNITION 7I 
therefore, to question the effectiveness of some of the phonetic training 
that is now given. There is need of intensive studies of the merits of 
different phonetic methods to determine if the limitations pointed out 
by Gates are inherent in these methods or are due to the way in which 
they are presented in the classroom. 
In the second place, it appears that training in phonetics is not 
equally effective in the case of all types of pupils. For example, Valentine 
(392) found that pupils who ranked low in intelligence made better 
progress with the Look-and-Say Method than with a phonetic method. 
On the other hand, Schmitt (331: 57-60) found that elaborate’ phonetic 
drills proved very effective in the case of certain pupils who were back- 
ward in reading “for a variety of causes.” Furthermore, Currier pointed 
out that “foreign children, children with impediments of speech, and 
children who had previously formed bad habits of pronunciation were — 
much helped by phonetic drills” (73: 448). Although these findings are 
not conclusive, they indicate that certain types of pupils can profit very 
much more from work in phonetics than can other types. There is need 
of studies to determine the kind or kinds of training in word recognition 
propriate for different types of children. 
In the third place, there is evidence that some children learn to 
analyze words with little or no specific instruction. For example, Currier 
pointed out the fact that a “certain number of pupils evidently possess a 
natural ‘phonetic sensé’ and employ it.” For these pupils “phonetic drills 
as a part of the daily réutine proved very tiresome” (73: 449). It follows 
that the current practice & subjecting all the pupils of a class to the same 
amount of drill in phonetics is open to serious criticism. 
‘Effect of practice on accuracy of recognition—The value of practice . 
in word recognition has been clearly demonstrated. For example, Schmitt 
reports the results of systematic training in phonetics in the case of 
children who encountered unusual difficulty in learning to read and whose 
cases had been diagnosed as congenital word-blindness. “Since they had 
gained almost nothing in their previous school life and had been making 
no observable progress up to the time of their residence in the special 
room, the new acquisition must be credited to the specialized teaching 
received there” (331: 759). 
In a study of a number of pupils who encountered difficulties in 
recognition (142: 101-7), the following methods were found effective: 
directing attention to the content; drilling on words similar in form, such 
as “come” and “came,” “how” dnd § ‘now”; training in the recognition 
of phonetic elements and providing practice in word-building and in the
-P-A-G-E-80
72 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
phonetic analysis of short words; training in the analysis of polysyllabic 
words--that is, the recognition of familiar parts, the division of words 
into syllables, and the recognition of prefixes, suffixes, and roots. 
Gates adopted a method of training in word perception with ele- 
mentary-school pupils involving the following features: ‘(1) Words mis- 
pronounced in reading were studied piecemeal by (2) division into 
syllables exposed singly with effort to increase gradually the size of the 
unit to two or more syllables, followed by (3) re-reading of sentence or 
paragraph to keep comprehension foremost” (104: 63). Very satisfactory 
results were obtained, as shown by the descriptions of individual cases. 
Concluding statements The discussions of this section have shown that 
the accurate recognition of words involves a number of perceptual 
processes and that inaccuracies should be attributed to specific causes 
rather than to defects in “general perceptual ability.” The studies to 
which reference was made show that there are several aids to recognition, 
namely, meaning or context, the general forms of words, ability to per- 
ceive the details of words, phonetic analysis, special characteristics of 
words, similarities in the endings of words, and possibly the length of 
words. There is need at the present time of detailed studies of the methods 
by which pupils recognize words at the beginning of their reading experi- 
ences, the stages through which they pass, and the habits which are 
essential at maturity. Furthermore, the advantages and limitations of 
each aid to word recognition, the conditions under which instruction can | 
be given to best advantage, and the types of training which will meet the 
needs of individuals most effectively should be considered. 
SPAN_OF RECOGNITION 
The size of the recognition unit—The amount recognized at each 
fixation of the eye is “a very strong factor in determining speed efficiency 
in both silent and oral reading” (329: 57), as shown by the high correla- 
tion between the number of fixations per line and.the rate of reading. 
Gt is also very significant in comprehending what is read, because a wide 
recognition span “relieves the mind of a detailed form of word analysis 
and makes possible the focusing of consciousness on the process of inter- 
pretation” (53: 30). The amount which the eye can perceive at a single 
fixation has been measured in two ways: first, in terms of the spat of 
perception as determined by short-exposure experiments an and, second, in 
terms of the span of recognition, or the amount recognized per fixation in 
reading. The studies of the span of perception and of the amount’ Tecog- 
nized per fixation will be summarized separately.
-P-A-G-E-81

FUNDAMENTAL HABITS OF RECOGNITION ~ 73 
Span of perception —Cattell (78: 34-36) exposed numbers, letters, 
words, and sentences to adults by means of a fall chronometer. The 
records showed that “ “on an average, consciousness can at one time gtasp 
. four numbers, three or four letters, two words, or a séntence compgsed. 
of four words... .. Not as many words as letters can be grasped at one 
time, but three times as many letters when they make words as when 
they have no connection.” As reported by Whipple in a summary of 
previous investigations (410: 232~33), the span of perception for digits 
is usually three or four with the upper limit at six or seven; for consonants, 
from four to seven letters and possibly eight if vowels are interspersed; 
for isolated words, four and not infrequently five; for short words com- 
bined into sentences, from four to six words, Sentences including thirty- . 
four letters have been grasped at a single exposure. Kibbe (214: 36) 
exposed sentences containing as many as sixteen letters to pupils 
in Grades II to VI, inclusive, and found that some pupils in the 
lowest grade tested were able to recognize them accurately at one exPo- 
sure. 
It is evident that the span of perception varies with the kind of 
material read and with the relationships that exist between its parts. 
The additional fact should be mentioned that there are wide individual 
differences (124: 140). These are much less striking for the perception of 
digits or non-sense material than for sense material. 
Size of units recognized in reading —Short-exposure studies, such as 
Cattell’s, reveal possible units of recognition. Photographic records of 
eye-movements in reading indicate the amount actually recognized at 
each fixation. In a laboratory experiment including children and adults, 
Schmidt found considerable range in the average number of words recog- 
nized per fixation. The records which are shown in Table XXXI (329: 56) 
are based on different passages for the three groups tested. They agree 
somewhat closely with the findings in other investigations. For example, 
Dearborn (77: 26) found that his adult subjects averaged from 1.0 to 
1.9 words per fixation in reading newspaper columns silently. Further- 
more, Table XXXI shows that there are very wide differences among 
readers at each level of maturity. The additional fact should be empha- 
sized that the amount recognized by a given reader varies widely from 
time to time. After summarizing all experiments published before 1907, 
Huey concluded that “we read by phrases, words, or letters as we may 
serve our purpose best. But we see, too, that the reader’s acquirement 
of ease and power in reading comes through increasing ability to read in 
larger units” (185: 116).
-P-A-G-E-82
74 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Comparison of units recognized in oral reading and silent reading —A 
comparison of the records in Table XXXI for oral and silent reading 
shows clearly that the number of words recognized per fixation is greater 
in silent reading than in oral reading. This fact harmonizes with the results 
of recent eye-movement studies except in the case of very young children. 
The explanation for the wider span in silent reading lies in the fact “that 
oral reading is controlled by speech units rather than divided into units 
of visual perception. The unit of speech is the word. In oral reading 
the eye moves from word to word, directing in this way the vocal appara- 
tus as it utters each unit. In silent reading, on the other hand, the unit 
for the trained adult is wholly different. .... If the mind can grasp a 
phrase, that becomes the unit governing fixation” (204: 21). 
A further analysis of the records in Table XX XI shows that some 
readers recognize fewer words per fixation in silent reading than others do

in oral reading. As a rule, this indicates very poor reading habits. Com- 
parative studies (329: 56) of oral-reading and silent-reading records show 
that a reader who recognizes a large or small unit in-one type of reading 
tanks correspondingly high or low in the other. 
Comparison of the span of recognition in reading and the span of 
perception-—A comparison of the number of words recognized at each 
fixation, as shown in Table XXXI, with the number of words recognized 
in short-exposure studies, such as Cattell’s, shows that few readers ap- 
proach in either oral or silent reading the limits set by their capacity, 
Striking evidence of this fact has been reported by C. T. Gray. “Take 
the case of subject No. 58, who made 68 pauses in a seven- to ten-word 
~ ling With a span of attention of 3.9 words, she should have read the 
line with about 3,0 instead of 6.8 pauses” (124: 127). Schmidt (329: 56), 
Dockeray (80: 128), Ruediger (326: 62), and other investigators present 
strong evidence in support of the view that even the most rapid readers 
seldom make use of the entire extent of the visual field that is available
-P-A-G-E-83
FUNDAMENTAL HABITS OF RECOGNITION 75 
for seeing words. It follows, therefore, that one of the major problems 
confronting teachers of reading is to develop a wide span of recognition. 
In this connection it is important to know the conditions that affect the 
size of the unit recognized. 
Conditions affecting the span of recognition.—The fact has been deter- 
mined that the size of the unit recognized varies with the thought rela- 
tionships that exist between its parts. For example, Hamilton’s studies 
of word perception show clearly that the amount recognized per exposure 
was less when reading words than when reading phrases or paragraphs. 
He therefore concluded that ‘‘the higher logical processes enter into and 
reinforce the processes of perception to a greater extent than we are 
accustomed to suppose” (155: 20):

The size of the unit recegnized varies alsé with the type of material 
read (203: 7-46). An example of such variation is presented in Table 
XXXII (203: 23-24), which-shows the number of fixations per line for 
four subjects in reading silently different kinds of passages. Although 
the passages used were not standardized as to difficulty, there is clear 
evidence that the amount recognized per fixation varies noticeably with 
the kind of passage read. 
Table XXXII reveals another fact that is equally significant. Some 
readers make relatively fewer fixations in one type of material than in 
other types. The explanation as given by Judd and Buswell is not far 
to seek. “‘One reader is absorbed in mathematics and to him this subject 
is almost as easy as fiction, while another reader finds mathematics 
difficult to a degree that makes it utterly distasteful” (203: 24). Conse- 
quently, the former grasps rapidly the meaning of passages in mathe- 
matics and recognizes large units s at éach fixation; the latter may excel ~~ 
in some other field.
-P-A-G-E-84
76 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Judd and Buswell also found that the number of fixations per line, 
and hence the size of the unit recognized, varied with the difficulty of the 
material and with the purpose of reading. They found, furthermore; that 
the unit recognized was greatly reduced in analytical study and in reading 
a foreign language (203: 47-89). 
In a study of growth stages of certain elements of reading, Buswell 
found that “up to a certain stage of maturity, growth in general achi¢ve- 
ment in oral reading is accompanied by a correspondingly rapid growth 
in span of recognition” (53: 45). No effort is made to prove a causal 
relationship between the elements correlated; ‘‘nevertheless, the fact that 
the development of a wider recognition span accompanies the elimination 
of these errors is suggestive.” 
These findings suggest two very important facts. The first is that 
the span of recognition varies with the type of material read, with the 
difficulty of the passages, with the purpose of reading, arid with the read- 
er’s mastery of the mechanics of reading. Increasé the difficulty of the 
material, present passages relating to new fields of thought, or increase 
the demand for keen critical interpretation and the span of recognition 
will probably decrease accordingly. The second fact is that passages 
which are most appropriate for exercises to increase the span of recogni- 
tion should be relatively simple and very interesting and relate toa famil- 
iar field. 
Growth periods in span of recognition —Eye-movement studies reveal 
very definite periods of growth or development in ee fn of recognition. 
Buswell (53: 11-57) determined the average number’ of fixations per line 
for 179 subjects in silent reading and for 164 subjects in oral reading. 
The median number of fixations per line for each school grade is shown in 
Table XX XIII (53: 26, 37) for both silent and oral reading. 
The records for silent reading reveal three definite tendencies: “first, 
a very rapid growth during the first four school years; second, a plateau 
extending through the fifth, sixth, seventh, and freshman years; and, 
third, a second rise during the middle high-school years. It is clear... . 
that the chief development in span of recognition comes early in the 
school course” (53: 28). The records for oral reading reveal similar 
tendencies. The recognition span, however, is wider for silent reading. 
Little or no significance should be attached to the records for first-grade 
pupils because of extreme individual variations. It is of the greatest 
significance, however, that, in general, silent reading is characterized by 
a wider span of recognition. Herein lies one of the fundamental differences 
between the two types of reading. Furthermore, Table XX XIII suggests
-P-A-G-E-85
FUNDAMENTAL HABITS OF. RECOGNITION 77 
that the first four grades present the greatest possibilities for specific 
training to increase the span of recognition. 
Effect of training on the span of recognition-—The fact has been empha- 
sized that a wide span of recognition characterizes the good reader. C. T. 
Gray attributes, in part at least, the difference between good and poor 
readers with reference to the span of recognition to the type of training 
received, “Certainly the slow reading which proceeds word by word and 
which emphasizes small units of thought is a type of training which makes 
for a small span of attention” (124: 144). Two types of studies have been 
made to determine the possibility of increasing, through practice, the

to increase the perceptual span in tachistoscopic experiments {the second 
includes efforts to increase the unit of recognition in reading 
Effect of training on the perceptual span—Whipple (411) exposed 
series of five-, six-, and seven-place unrelated letters for eight-hundredths 
of a second to six college students. He found that “‘the average limit of 
the range of attention is between four and five impressions,” that “there 
are but slight individual differences,” and that “practice has but a very 
slight effect” even with 250 or more exposures. The small increase secured 
was explained in terms of “habituation to the experimental conditions” 
and of development of the “trick” of grouping. C. T. Gray (124: 149-60), 
on the other hand, secured a marked increase in the perceptual span in 
the case of two fourth-grade subjects. The training included short-

exposure practice exercises based on four types of material, namely, 
sense material, non-sense syllables, digits, and groups of zeros. When the 
same type of training, supplemented by practice in rapid reading, was 
given to two sixth-grade pupils, there was no “striking change” in the 
span of recognition as determined by the number of words recognized in 
tachistoscopic exposures. After comparing these results with those 
secured by Whipple, Gray concluded, “It seems that positive results can 
be obtained if the training is undertaken as early as the fourth year.”? 
The results of experiments concerning the effect of practice on visual 
apprehension by such investigators as Foster (97) and Dallenbach (75, 76) 
are not included in this summary because the exposures in their experi- 
ments were long enough to permit several fixations. 
Effect of training on the size of the unit recognized in reading —The 
eye-movement records of the two sixth-grade pupils to ‘whom reference 
has just been made were secured by C. T. Gray (124: 153) during the 
course of his experiment. A comparison of the number of fixations per 
line before and after training showed that there was no change in the case 
of one of the pupils, a rapid reader when the experiment began. There 
was, however, a reduction from 15.5 to 6.1 fixations per line in the case 
of the other pupil, a slow reader. After an interval of three months, his. 
average number of fixations per line was 8.4. These records indicate that 
training may increase the size of the unit recognized in reading, although 
no increase is secured in the perceptual span as determined by tachisto— 
scopic exposures, 
Additional evidence of the effect of training on the amount recognized. 
at each fixation was obtained by O’Brien (280: 232-69), who secured, 
photographic records of the eye-movements of pupils who had received 
training to increase rate of silent reading and to decrease vocalization 
The average number of fixations per line before and after training are 
reported for five pupils in Table XXXIV (280:-236-69). This table shows 
a “noticeable reduction in the number of fixation pauses” in all the grades, 
represented, It is evident, therefore, that the size of the unit recognized 
in reading may be increased through appropriate training. Since adults 
as well as children respond to training in speed of reading, it is valid to 
conclude that the former as well as the latter may increase their span of 
recognition through appropriate training. 
Concluding statements ——The discussions of this section have made q 
clear-cut distinction between the span of perception and the span of 
recognition in reading. The studies to which referénce was made show 
that the span of perception is usually much greater than the size of the’

through training. Growth in the span ofrecognition occurs largely in the 
first four grades; it may also occur,§ a result of training, in the upper

grades and even in the case of adults. An important problem for addi- 
tional study relates to the causes of wide differences among pupils in the 
span of recognition and the most appropriate measures to adopt in in- 
creasing it in the case of poor readers. 
RATE OF RECOGNITION 
Importance of rate of recognition —A mature reader not only recognizes 
large units at each fixation but also recognizes units quickly. For example, 
Buswell (53: 1-3) found that a mature reader recognized larger units per 
fixation of the eye than a first-grade pupil and recognized them much more 
quickly. Such evidence makes it clear that the rate of recognition, regard- 
less of the size of the unit recognized, is an important factor in reading. 
Variations in rate of recognition—The method which is usually em- 
ployed in determining the rate of recognition is to photograph eye-move- 
ments while reading and to calculate the duration of the fixations. 
Through the use of this method Dearborn (77: 130) found that “the 
fixation pauses for four subjects in simple newspaper reading” varied 
from an average of 160.8 to 401.9 thousandths of a second. Schmidt 
(329: 118) found that the average duration of pauses varied from 214 to 
470 thousandths of a second for silent reading and from 230 to 520 
thousandths of a second for oral reading. “These durations (silent read- 
ing) are somewhat higher than those found by previous investigators, 
. because the reading was in this connection of the careful rather
-P-A-G-E-88
80 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
than the rapid type.” These dtta show clearly that some readers recog- 
nize given units much more rah‘dly than do other readers. They also 
show that recognition is more rapicrin silent reading than in oral reading. 
The longer duration of fixations in oyal reading is dueglargely to the 
retarding influence of the voice. Thus Buswell points out t®@t “pronounc- 
ing the words slows down the entire process, giving the reader more time 
for his recognitions but establishing a habit of making longer fixations’’ 
(53: 40). os 
Relation between rate of recognition and speed of reading.—The fact 
has been emphasized that some readers recognize given units more quickly 
than do others. It is important, therefore, to inquire concerning the rela- 
tion between rate of recognition and speed of reading. Dearborn found 
that there was ‘‘a tendency for the slow reader to make both more pauses 
and longer pauses” (77: 130). Schmidt (329: 79-80) found that, “while 
"there is fairly marked correlation between the average duration of pauses 
per line and the total perception time per line, a short duration of pauses 
does not in nearly all cases imply a rapid reader.” From these facts it may 
be concluded that rate of recognition is an important factor in speed of 
reading but that there are other factors, such as the span of recognition, 
which influence it. 
Conditions affecting rate of recognition—Analytical studies of eye- 
movement records reveal three important facts. First, changes in the 
difficulty of the passages read are accompanied by changes in the dura~ 
tion of the fixations. For example, Judd and Buswell (203: 7-26) found 
that the rate of recognition in silent reading was more rapid in the case 
of the easier passages than in the case of the difficult passages of the 
Gray Oral Reading Test. Second, changes in the kind of passage read. 
are accompanied by changes in the rate of recognition. For example, 
Judd and Buswell (203: 23-24) found that the duration of the fixations 
was much longer for some readers in the case of easy verse, blank verse, 
or algebra than in the case of fiction or geography. The statement should 
be added that the order of difficulty was not the same for all readers. 
Passages which are read rapidly by some readers are read slowly by other 
readers. Third, changes in the purpose of reading are accompanied by 
changes in the rate of recognition. For example, Judd and Buswell 
(203: 27-46) found that the duration of the fixations was much longer in 
reading for the purpose of answering questions than in reading when no 
answers were expected. They also found (203: 47~89) that reading in 
volving analytical study increased the duration of the fixations. 
The studies to which reference has been made show that rate of
-P-A-G-E-89
% 
FUNDAMENTAL HABITS OF RECOGNITION , 81 
recognition is most rapid when reading relatively simple passages which 
relate to a familiar field and when reading cursorily rather than inten- 
sively. If difficult passages are used, if the passages refer to unfamiliar 
fields, or if the study demands are increased, the rate of recognition 
decreases. It follows that practice material to increase the rate of recog- 
nition should be very simple, relate to familiar fields, and be highly 
charged with interest. 
Growth periods in rate of recognition —Schmidt (329: 79) determined 
the average duration of fixation pauses for groups of elementary-school 
pupils, high-school pupils, and adults. They were 314.0, 311.1, and 308.2 
thousandths of a second, respectively, in silent reading, and 398.0, 
372-9, and 380.8 thousandths of a second, respectively, in oral reading. 
These figures suggest that there is very little progress in rate of recognition 
after the elementary-school period. Inasmuch as passages of different 
degrees of difficulty were used in this study, it is doubtless true that there 
is more growth after the elementary-school period in reading increasingly 
difficult passages than is revealed by these data. Buswell determined the 
average duration of pauses in twenty-fifths of a second for groups of 
pupils and students at various levels of advancement. His findings for 
both silent and oral reading are summarized in Table XXXV (53: 109, 
135). This table shows clearly that growth in recognition for both 
types of reading takes place very rapidly in the lower grades and approxi- 
mates maturity by the fifth grade. Buswell concluded that rate of recog- 
nition, particularly for relatively simple passages, ‘is one element of 
reading which can be carried to the level of maturity very early in the 
school period” (53: 33). His data show that a rate of recognition “of 
from five to six twenty-fifths of a second satisfies the demands of ma- 
turity in reading.” 
Effect of training on rate of recognition —Very little evidence has been 
secured concerning the effect of training on rate of recognition. In an 
investigation of the effect on speed in reading of (x) training in rapid 
silent reading and (2) training to decrease vocalization, O’Brien (280: 
232-69) secured eye-movement records of six elementary-school pupils 
before and after training. The records showed that the increase in speed 
of reading was due primarily to the enlargement of the span of recogni- 
tion. The duration of the fixations was shorter in one case, remained 
unchanged in three cases, and was longer in two cases. If other types of 
training had been given, the results might have been different. The 
records showed, however, that four of these pupils approximated maturity 
in rate of recognition before the training period began. .
-P-A-G-E-90
82 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
C. T. Gray (224: 149-53) provided training in speed of reading for 
two sixth-grade pupils, a slow reader and a rapid reader. Two types of 
training were given for a period of twenty days, namely, practice with 
short-exposure exercises and training in rapid reading. The records for 
speed of reading showed that the slow reader improved greatly as a result 
of the training and that the rapid reader made a noticeable gain. The 
eye-movement records showed that the average length of pauses was 
reduced from 15.4 to 12.6 fiftieths of a second in the case of the slow 
reader and was increased from 11.0 to 11.5 fiftieths of a secopd in the 
case of the rapid reader. The fact should be remembered that the rapid 
reader approximated the standards set by Buswell before the training

_ began. This study indicates that training in rate of recognition may 
prove effective in the case of upper-grade pupils who have not attained 
mature habits in this respect. 
Concluding statements.—The fact that pupils improve rapidly in rate 
of recognition during the first four grades shows clearly that the types of 
training now given in the primary grades are more of less effective. It 
remains, however, to determine the specific kinds of exercises which 
prove most valuable. In the meantime, teachers should continue to make 
use of the methods which experience has taught are valuable, such as 
providing simple selections that are highly charged with interest, develop- 
ing strong motives for reading, encouraging much independent reading, 
and providing frequent quick-perception exercises.

RHYTHMICAL PROGRESS, OF PERCEPTIONS 
Importance of regularity in eye-movement habits —Huey early observed 
the fact that “readers showed a strong rhythmic tendency. Each would 
fall into.a reading pace that seemed most natural to him and would then 
ead_page—after—page-in—almost exactly the samé time” (185: 175). 
Dearborn supports the same point of view when he says, “It is, in the 
writer’s belief, clearly indicated by the, above experiments that one of 
the essentials of natural and rapid reading is that the reader’s eye should 
at once be able to acquire a regular and uniform motor habit of reaction 
for each line” (77: 115). In summarizing the results of a comparative 
study of the habits of mature and immature readers, Buswell pointed out 
the following facts: 
In the eye-movement record of a mature reader it will be seen that the eye 
progresses across the lines with a rhythmic swing, making approximately the 
same number of fixations per line, with few or no backward movements. In 
contrast with this, the immature reader moves forward a few fixations, then 
backward to refixate upon some word which was not clearly recognized, then 
forward, and soon back again in the reverse direction. This oscillation of eye- 
movements back and forth along the lines indicates that the reader is confused 
and is unable to proceed in regular order along the lines [53: 33]. 
These findings make it clear that rhythmical progress_of perceptions 
characterizes. the good reader and is one of the desirable goals of reading 
instruction. 
Causes of regressive movements in reading -—Trregularity i in perception 
. has been measured in terms of the number of regressive or backward 
movements of the eye per line. In an analysis of the causes of regressive 
movements in silent reading, Buswell discovered four types produced by 
as many different causes. Brief descriptions of each type follow: 
x. “The most common regressive movement occurs at the beginning 
of a line where the return sweep of the eye has failed to carry the fixation 
back to the first word ih the line and an additional regressive movement 
is required to make the initial part of the line.clear. This type of regressive 
movement persisis up to the more mature stages of reading” (53: 34). 
2. A second type of regressive movement is caused by the fact that 
mature readers read with a relatively small number of fixations. “In 
their effort to grasp a larger unit in a single eye-fixation they occasionally 
overreach their maximum span and find it necessary to make a backward 
eye-movement to clarify the meaning” (53: 36). However, the most 
mature readers have overcome this tendency and make few, if any, 
regressive movements.
-P-A-G-E-92
84 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
3. Lack of word knowledge is a third cause of regressive movements. 
These occur among both children and adults when word difficulties are 
* encountered. 
~ A fourth type of regressive movement is characterized by a 
“rattdom oscillation of the eye with no apparent plan on the part of the - 
reader. .... The reader fails to get a clear perception of the meaning 
and accordingly sets up a series of eye-fixations which move back and 
forth over the area, causing difficulty. This type of eye-movement may 
occur in the beginning stages of reading, where it shows lack of ability 
to grasp proper units of recognition, and it may occur in the later stages 
of reading where the reading gives way to analysis of some kind” (53: 36). 
An additional cause of regressive movements is the adjustments to 
the content of different types of passages. Judd and Buswell (203: 7~26) 
photographed the eye-movements of several subjects when reading fiction, 
geography, rhetoric, easy verse, French grammar, blank verse, and 
algebra. An analysis of the records showed that a reader may make many 
more regressive movements p-reading Some types of zmatelh! than in 
readipg other types. “One reader swings into an easy, fluent stride and 
: chowSimterest and comprehension when he reads about algebraic formu- 
las; another halts and stumbles and grows afraid” (203: 24). C. T. Gray 
(124: 105) also found that the number of regressive movements varied 
with different types of material, such as prose and poetry. : 
The number of regressive movements may also be increased by 
changes in the purpose of reading. For example, Judd and Busweit— 
(203: 28) found that the average number of regressive movements was 
usually greater in study than in rapid reading. 
It is evident that an increase in the number of regressive movements 
may be due to various causes, such as inaccurate return sweeps of the 
eye from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, too long for- 
ward movements of the eye, lack of word knowledge, confusion as to 
meaning or pronunciation, unfamiliarity with certain types of material, 
and changes in the purpose of reading. There is need of additional studies 
to determine why some pupils habitually make many regressive move- 
ments and how this tendency may be corrected. 
Growth periods in rhythmical progress of perceptions —The periods of 
rapid growth in the rhythmical or uninterrupted progress of perceptions 
along the lines have been measured by Buswell in terms of the average 
number of regressive movements per line. His findings for pupils in the | 
elementary school, high school, and college appear in Table XXXVI 
(53: 34, 42). This table indicates that a relatively high level of efficiency
-P-A-G-E-93
FUNDAMENTAL HABITS OF RECOGNITION 85 
™ 
is attained during the first six grades in both oral and silent reading. 
The elimination of regressive movement is very rapid during the first 
four grades. This is in harmony with natural expectation, since pupils 
improve rapidly during this period in other phases of reading on which” 
_ rhythmical progress depends, such as accuracy and independence in word 
recognition, accurate return sweeps of the eye from the end of one line 
to the beginning of the next,'and habits of accurate interpretation of the 
content. 
Differences in oral and silent reading —Table XXXVI shows that 
growth in the regularity of perceptions is very rapid in the lower grades 
in oral and silent reading. Little or no significance should be attached

to the smaller number of regressive movements in oral reading in the 
first and second grades. The large number of regressive movements in 
oral reading in the upper grades, high school, and college is due to the 
fundamental difference in the two types of reading. In oral reading each 
word must be vocalized, and its pronunciation as well as its meaning 
must be recognized. Furthermore, the voice is unable to pronounce the 
words as rapidly as the‘eye recognizes them. Consequently, the eye is 
restrained in its forward movement and not infrequently moves to the 
left in order to refresh the mind with the exact sequence of words, to 
~ verify the pronunciation of a word, or to wait until the voice more nearly 
overtakes the eye. Regressive movements of these types are not common 
until pupils have made considerable progress in the rapid recognition of 
words and groups of words. -
-P-A-G-E-94
86 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Effect of practice on the rhythmical progress of perceptions.—Very few 
reports have been published of experiments undertaken for the specific 
purpose of promoting the rhythmical progress of perceptions. The results 
of one series of training exercises have been reported in the case of a 
pupil whose eye-movements were very irregular (138). In the first set of 
exercises the words were written five letter-spaces apart. The subject 
was told to read the words in order without looking to the right or left 
of a given word until it was recognized. ‘After ten five-minute exercises 
of this type he showed marked improvement in the regularity of his eye- 
movements and in the fluency of his reading.” In the second set of 
exercises groups of words were typewritten five letter-spaces apart. 
Essentially the same procedure was followed as in the first set, with 
equally satisfactory results. Practice was finally based on reading 
passages in books. “If irregularities were noted, suggestions calculated to 
correct the difficulty were offered. At the end of nine weeks marked im- 
provement had been made, as evidenced by greater fluency and fewer 
irregularities.” 
Evidence of the effect of training to increase the span of recognition 
and the rate of reading was secured by C, T. Gray (124: 153) in the case 
of the slow reader and the rapid reader to whom reference has already 
been made. The training which was given aimed to increase the span of 
recognition and the rate of silent reading. Records were secured of the 
average number of regressive movements before practice, after practice, 
and after an interval following the practice. The average number of 
regressive movements on the three occasions were 4.5, 1.2, and 1.2, 
respectively, for the slow reader and 1.0, 0.8, and 1.5, respectively, for 
the rapid reader. It is evident that the training was very effective in 
the case of the slow reader. 
In a study of the effect on reading rate of training exercises to reduce 
vocalization and to promote habits of rapid reading, O’Brien (280: 266) 
determined the average number of regressive movements per line before 
and after training for five pupils. His results showed that there was 
improvement in four of the five cases and no change in the fifth case. The 
"average number of regressive movements per line was 1.5 before training 
and 0.8 after training. 
Two conclusions may be drawn from these studies. First, very little 
has been done experimentally to increase the rhythmical progress of per- 
ceptions except in remedial cases. Second, training which results in in- 
creasing the span of recognition and speed of reading improves the regu- 
larity of eye-movements. Other studies show indirectly that training

wo — 
‘ which increases accuracy and fluency in oral reading and speed in intef 
preting what is read is equally beneficial. 
ACCURATE RETURN SWEEPS 
Nature of accurate return sweeps.—Practically all eye-movement 
_ Studies reveal the fact that the good reader moves his eyes quickly from 
“the end of one line to a point sufficiently near the beginning of the next 
line so that all the words to the left of the first fixation are recognized. 
The error which the poor reader makes is to let his eyes fixate at a point 
on the line too far to the right, making additional movements to the left 
necessary before he can read regularly from left to right. Very few 
explanations have been offered for such inaccuracies beyond the general 
statement that pupils fail to form the right habit. 
Effect of training —The child secures his first idea.of the return sweep 
as the teacher writes sentences on the board for him to,read or as she 
points to the lines on a chart. When the book is introduced, pupils secure 
a sufficient amount of practice to form accurate habits. Only in remedial 
cases has specific training to correct wrong habits been reported. In one 
such case (138) the lines were typewritten about an inch apart. “The 
subject was instructed. to move his eyes quickly from the end of one line 
to the beginning of the next without stopping to look at any of the 
words on the second line.” A daily five-minute practice period proved 
very effective, as shown by subsequent reading records.

CHAPTER X 
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 
Problems for consideration.—The comprehension of what is read is 
one of the most important phases of reading and has attracted wide atten- 
tion among investigators during recent years. The studies which have 
been made relate largely to the following problems: the nature of intel- 
ligent interpretation; growth periods; the conditions that have accompa- 
nied differences in comprehension; the relation of specific factors to 
comprehension; the effect of specific methods and training techniques on 
ability to interpret; the results of investigations of different study proce- 
dures; and the relative merits of different methods of teaching literature. 
It is the purpose of. this chapter to summarize the results of studies relat- 
ing to these problems. 
THE NATURE OF INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 
Varied nature of interpretation-—The varied nature of interpretation 
is well illustrated by the reading,,tests which have been designed to 
measure it. For example, the following methods have been adopted by 
test-makers for indicating comprehension: deleting incorrect words (6r), 
filling in words to complete the meaning (Stanford Achievement Tests), 
selecting the central idea of a passage (428), following directions (153), 
answering questions (374), reproducing what is read (350), and various 
combinations of these methods. Since the processes involved in reading 
vary with the purpose (203), it is evident that comprehension in its 
broader sense includes many interrelated and complex processes. 
Fundamental phases of interpretation.—At least three fundamental 
phases of interpretation have been distinguished, namely, accuracy or 
quality, speed, and depth. Their significance is illustrated in efforts to 
develop scientific tests of comprehension. For example, Burgess (48) 
considers them as variables which must be definitely controlled.” In 
measuring accuracy, “the difficulty of the task and the time allowed for 
doing it are maintained as constants, and the variable measured is the 
quality of the performance.” In measuring speed of interpretation, the 
difficulty is held constant, and speed is measured by determining either 
the amount interpreted accurately in a given time or the time required 
to interpret a given amount accurately. In measuring depth of interpre-

ey

tation, speed and accuracy are held constant, and “the variable is the 
difficulty of the task successfully done.” Unfortunately, many of the 
investigations to which reference will be made failed to observe the princi- 
ple of the single variable in measuring interpretation, Consequently, 
there are very few opportunities to make rigid comparisons of the results 
of experiments in this field. 
Accuracy, speed, and depth of interpretation are also intimately 
related to the problems of teaching reading. The fact has been repeated- 
‘ly emphasized that children and adults read for various purposes. It 
follows that pupils must learn to carry on each of the essential types of 
“reading with accuracy, with reasonable speed, and at levels of difficulty 
appropriate to their maturity. Observations reveal the fact that very 
little provision is made for the development of each of the fundamental 
phases of interpretation when training pupils to read. Experiments are 
needed which will determine the most effective methods of securing 
progress and which will result in specific directions for use in classrooms 
in teaching pupils to read effectively. 
Essential processes involved in interpretation——Psychologists have 
emphasized the fact that various mental processes are prerequisite to, or 
essential in, the interpretation of what is read, such as recugnition, 
association, analysis, and judgment. It is the aim at this point to call 
attention only to those processes which have been considered in the 
investigations reported. 
1. Fluency in recognition.—The advantage of speed and accuracy of 
recognition when reading for content has been emphasized in several 
investigations. In the report of the Cleveland survey Judd described 
the value of good habits of recognition as follows: 
The poor reader is one who is unable to pass readily from the printed 
symbol to the meaning. For the poor reader the mere mechanical processes are 
obstacles, and he loses time in trying to perform the preliminary mental acts 
which are necessary before he can comprehend the passage: In the case of the 
good reader, on the other hand, the mechanics of the process are very fluent 
and rapid. The proficient reader has mastered the words and moves on without 
hesitation to the meaning [200: 127]. 
In a study of fundamental reading habits Buswell found that “as 
ability to comprehend increases, the average recognition time becomes 
shorter. This means that when the recognition process becomes more 
nearly automatic and requires no special analytical effort, the mental 
processes of the reader are relieved of the necessity of close attention to 
the perceptual elements and can therefore concentrate on the meaning
-P-A-G-E-98
go INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
of the passage with a resulting increase in the comprehension score” 
(83: 51-52). 
In a study of the eye-voice span in reading Buswell (51) found that 
the “same types of confused eye-movements” occur in both oral and silent 
reading when difficulties with the test words are experienced. The oral- 
reading records showed that subjects with a wide eye-voice span have 
fewer difficulties in reading such material than have subjects with a nar- 
row span. The silent-reading records showed that when difficult words 
were encountered “the eye returned to the word causing the difficulty just 
as it returned to the position of the voice in oral reading. .... Tf the 
difficulty in getting the meaning in silent reading is sufficiently great, there 
is reversion not only to the habit of bringing the eye back to the location 
of the recognition of meaning but also to the most primitive habit of 
silently pronouncing the word” (51: 103). 
The evidence presented in these studies should not be interpreted 
to mean that habits of recognition must be emphasized at the sacrifice of 
everything else. Other sections of this report show that the content of 
what is read is of first importance even in developing habits of effective 
recognition. The findings which have been summarized show, however, 
that the reader can devote himself entirely to the interpretation of mean- 
ings when the processes of recognition proceed automatically, or without 
conscious direction. 
2. Anticipation of meaning.—In a keen analysis of the results of 
various eye-movement investigations, C. T. Gray (126) pointed out the 
fact that “the development of rhythm is almost a continuous process’? 
from the first grade through college. On the other hand, the span of 
perception and the duration of fixations approximate maturity in about 
the fourth or fifth grade. fone type of training essential in eliminating 
regressive movements and in perfecting the reading process “is that which 
enables the child to make use of his marginal impressions in an accurate 
manner so that the ‘leads’ which he follows in order to arrive at fina] 
interpretation may always be correct.”’ Three aids in this connection 
referred to by Gray are familiarity with the specific field to which the 
selection relates, a feeling for language relations, and wide reading. 
3. Analysis, association, and judgment.—In an analysis of the errors 
of children in understanding sentences, Thorndike (378) secured examples 
of errors in the functioning of several mental processes. For example, the 
selection of a wrong word or element in a paragraph is cited as a case of 
poor analysis. Attaching too little or too much importance to the mean- 
ing of a word or group of words and failure to attach the right meanings
-P-A-G-E-99
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION OI 
to words as they are used are given as examples of poor association. The 
‘fishing around in the text” for something to use in answering a question 
“and its use without reorganization are perhaps the most debased forms 
of reasoning—selective thinking—which school work shows.” 
Two conclusions of Thorndike (377) based on the same test records 
illustrate very well the variety of mental processes in the interpretation 
of what is read. The first is that “reading is a very elaborate procedure, 
involving a weighing of each of many elements in a sentence, their organ- 
ization in the proper reélatioris one, to another, the selection of certain of 
their connotations afd the rejection of dthers, and the co-operation of 
many forces to determine final response.” The second conclusion is 
“that reading an explanatory or argumentative paragraph in text- 
books on geography or history or civics and (though to a less degree) 
reading a narrative or description involve the same sort of organization 
and analytic action of ideas as occur in thinking of supposedly higher 
sorts.”” 
Effect of different kinds and levels of difficulty of reading material — 
The experiments by Judd and Buswell (203) show that changes in the kind 
and difficulty of the material read result in significant adjustments on 
the part of the reader. The passages used in their experiments included 
fiction, geography, rhetoric, easy verse, French grammar, blank verse, 
and algebra, and Paragraphs 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 of the Gray Oral Reading 
Test. The photographic records of the eye-movements of the subjects 
used, summarized on page 75, show that “increased difficulty of passages 
means new combinations of scope and duration of attention” in reading. 
These do not follow a uniform pattern but rather very complex patterns 
which vary with individuals. Similar statements may be made with 
respect to the effect of different types of reading material on the perform- 
ance of readers. The explanation of these differences is not far to seek. 
One reader is absorbed in mathematics, and to him this subject is almost 
as wasy as fiction, while another reader finds mathematics difficult to a degree 
that makes it utterly distasteful. .... One reader swings into an easy, fluent 
stride and shows interest and comprehension when he reads about algebraic 
formulas; another halts and stumbles and grows afraid [203: 24]. 
Additional evidence of the effect of difficulty on comprehension is 
provided in the case of oral reading by the studies of Gray (131: 153) 
and McLeod (249: 530-31) and in the case of silent reading by the studies 
of Gray (131: 102). It is of the greatest importance to recognize clearly 
that when readers pass from one type of material to another, there are 
changes in their reading attitudes and habits.
-P-A-G-E-100
Q2 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Effect of different purposes of reading—The fact has been recognized 
for years that children and adults read for many purposes, such as those 
listed on page 9. It was not until recent years, however, that experi- 
ments established the fact that changes in the purpose of reading are 
accompanied by changes in the processes involved. In the experiments 
of Judd and Buswell (203) twenty subjects were asked to read passages 
(x) rapidly, as in reading a newspaper item to find out what it is about, 
and (2) carefully, in order to answer questions about the content. Eye- 
movement records were secured as the subjects read. 
When the records were compared, it was found that in most cases care- 
ful reading was accompanied by a larger number of fixations, by longer 
duration of fixations, and by more regressive movements per line. These 
adjustments on the part of the reader indicate that the processes of 
interpretation differed in the two cases. A second conclusion which the 
records justified is that “the effect on the reading process of a call to read. 
carefully is very different in different individuals. In some cases the effect 
is to narrow attention to a very limited range of words; in other cases the 
effect is to make the time devoted to the interpretation of certain impres- 
sions very long or quite irregular. The more common effect is the narrow- 
ing of attention” (203: 38). 
The fact that reading processes vary with the reader’s purpose has 
two implications. First, pupils should be trained to meet the specific 
reading demands of school and life situations. Since pupils respond 
differently to directions, teachers should study the dominant reading 
attitudes and tendencies of pupils and should skilfully adapt instruction 
to individual needs. Second, great care should be observed in comparing 
the results of different reading investigations. Rigid comparisons of 
achievement in interpretation can be made only when similar reading 
attitudes are aroused. 
General and specific effects of training in interpretation.—It has been 
shown that there are various types of reading activities, that numerous 
processes are involved, and that changes in the content or difficulty of 
what is read or in the purpose of reading are accompanied by changes 
in the reading habits involved. Attention is directed next to the general 
and specific effects of training in interpretation. 
Gates and Van Alstyne (108) gave a battery of tests to the pupils of 
Grades III to VI, inclusive. Each grade included three classes. One class 
in each grade was given one type of training; the second class was given. 
another type of training; and the third class, the control group, was given 
no training. “At the end of the training period, all the groups were given
-P-A-G-E-101

-P-A-G-E-102
_ 94 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
reader. These adjustments follow not a uniform pattern but varied 
patterns, depending on the characteristics of the reader. Furthermore, 
the discussions have shown that, whereas there are some general effects 
of training in a particular type of reading, training must be provided in 
each of various essential types in order to insure effective habits. It is 
evident that the problems of teaching interpretation are varied and com~ 
plex. One of the problems most urgently in need of scientific study relates 
to the types of reading activities that are most essential in modern life, 
the processes that are involved, and the types of training which are most 
effective in establishing desirable habits. 
GROWTH OR PROGRESS IN THREE PHASES OF 
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 
Significance of growth periods—It is the purpose of this section to 
summarize the results of investigations relating to growth or progress in. 
intelligent interpretation. Such information shows in which grades cur~ 
rent instruction is most effective with respect to comprehension. It also 
reveals the grades in which there are large possibilities for the develop~ 
ment of habits of thoughtful reading. It should not be assumed that 
current instruction results in the most desirable types of progress. As 
instruction in reading improves, radical changes may occur in the progress 
of children in different phases of reading. 
Accuracy of interpretation of simple passages.—The Courtis Silent 
Reading Test No. 2 (70) is, to a large extent, a measure of the accuracy 
of interpretation of simple passages. The standard scores for this test 
follow: second grade, 59; third grade, 78; fourth grade, 80; fifth grade, o 33 
sixth grade, 95. It is evident that accuracy of interpretation as measured. 
by this test increases rapidly during the second, third, and fourth grades 
and remains at a very high level in the upper grades. In schools in which 
progress is very satisfactory, a high level of accomplishment is reacheq 
by the end of the third grade (133). This fact justifies the statement that 
there are possibilities in the development of accuracy of interpretation, 
which have not been attained by most schools. 
Speed of interpretation of simple passages.—Three tests supply evidence 
of growth in the speed of interpreting simple passages: the Courtis 
Silent Reading Test No. 2 (70), the Burgess Scale for Measuring Ability 
in Silent Reading (48), and the Chapman-Cook Speed of Reading Test 
(61). The standard scores for these tests or data derived from them are 
presented in Table XXXVII. This table shows that speed of interpreting 
simple passages increases rapidly from the second grade to the eighth
-P-A-G-E-103
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 95 
grade, inclusive, the rate of increase being somewhat more rapid in the 
lower grades than in the upper grades in the case of two of the tests. A 
comparison of the records for speed and accuracy of interpretation as 
measured by the Courtis test shows that, whereas accuracy of interpreta- 
tion reaches a high level relatively early in the grades, speed of inter- 
preting accurately continues to improve much later in the grades. 
Depth of interpretation.—In this discussion growth in depth of inter- 
pretation indicates progress in dealing successfully with increasingly 
difficult problems of interpretation. The Thorndike-McCall Reading 
Scale (243) measures ability to interpret increasingly difficult passages. 
The standards for the A sections of the various grades follow: Grade II, 
25.0; Grade III, 33.4; Grade IV, 38.7; Grade V, 44.8; Grade VI, 49.1; 
Grade VII, 53.5; Grade VIII, 57.1. The scores indicate that there is

steady progress throughout the elementary grades, the rate of increase 
being slightly greater in the lower grades than in the upper grades. The 
standard scores for the Monroe Silent Reading Tests show that progress 
continues throughout the high-school period. It is a significant fact that 
similar progress curves are revealed by the scores of practically every 
test which makes use of passages of increasing difficulty. 
Progress of intelligent interpretation in oral reading.—Significant facts 
are also available concerning growth in interpretation in oral reading. A 
study (131: 149-54) has been made of this problem in the University 
Elementary School of the University of Chicago through the use of the 
Gray Oral Reading Test, which includes a series of twelve short passages 
arranged in the order of increasing difficulty. After each paragraph had 
been read, the pupils were asked four questions concerning its content. 
The answers were graded on a percentage basis. A record was made of
-P-A-G-E-104
96 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
the comprehension scores of each pupil on the first passage of the test 
and on the hardest passage he was able to read successfully according to 
the standards of the test. Four weeks later the test was given again. At 
this time the test was preceded by a fifteen-minute study period, for 
which the following directions were given: 
You are going to take the oral-reading test again. Study the paragraphs 
carefully for fifteen minutes so that you can read them as well as possible and 
so that you can answer any question which may be asked about each paragraph.

Fic. 2.—Progress in comprehension in oral reading. The two upper lines show the 
records of the various grades for the easiest passage—the full-drawn line, B, before 
study; the broken line, A, after study. The two lower lines show the records for the 
most difficult passage—the full-drawn line, D, before study; the broken line, C, after 
study.   
The improvement in the oral-reading scores was practically uniform 
throughout the grades and may be disregarded in the interpretation of 
the comprehension scores. The average comprehension scores for the 
easiest passage and the most difficult passage read successfully with and 
without study are represented in Figure 2 (131: 152). 
Line B in the figure shows that, on the average, the pupils of the 
various grades did about equally well in interpreting without study the 
first paragraph of the test. Since this was a very simple passage, the 
meaning was clear as soon as the words were recognized. There was
-P-A-G-E-105
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 97 
approximately the same amount of improvement in comprehension 
throughout the grades following the fifteen-minute study period, as 
shown by Line A. 
The results for the most difficult paragraph were quite different. The 
steady drop from Grade ILA to Grade IV A, as shown by Line D, 
indicates that the pupils of these’ grades were able to read orally, in 
increasing degree, material which they did not understand. Following the 
study period of fifteen minutes, the pupils of Grades II A, III B, and 
TIL A made distinctly poorer records, as shown by Line C, than in the 
first test without study. This means that progress in these grades was 
more rapid in word recognition than in the interpretation of content. 
The change in the direction of the lines at Grades III A and IV A and 
the crossing of these lines near the beginning of Grade IV B indicate 
that these grades represent a critical period in the development of reading 
ability. Personal conferences with the pupils of these grades showed that 
those who did poorly in comprehension directed most of their attention 
to word recognition during the study period, while those who did well 
in comprehension directed far more attention to the interpretation of 
meanings. In a similar study by McLeod (249: 530) in a public school, it 
was found that the curve corresponding to Line C in Figure 2 continued 
to fall to a lower and lower level throughout the middle and upper grades. 
This is a striking example of failure to give adequate attention to problems 
of interpretation. 
Conclusions.—Four tentative conclusions concerning growth periods 
in interpretation are suggested by the results of current instruction in 
reading. (x) Ability to interpret simple passages accurately increases 
rapidly in the lower grades and may reach a very high level by the end 
of the third grade. It is very important that provision be made for culti- 
vating from the beginning the attitude of looking for meanings in all 
reading experiences. (2) Speed of interpreting simple passages improves 
rapidly and somewhat steadily throughout the grades. It follows that 
special attention may be given advantageously to this phase of reading 
in the higher grades as well as in the lower grades. (3) Depth of interpreta- 
tion increases steadily throughout the elementary school and high school. 
* Current tests also show that there is steady growth in reading for various 
purposes. In the cultivation of the different habits that are essential 
there is unlimited opportunity for carefully planned instruction in 
practically every grade. (4) By the time many pupils reach the third 
grade, their ability to pronounce words exceeds their ability to inter- 
pret meanings. Special attention should be given at this stage of de-
-P-A-G-E-106
98 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
velopment to the cultivation of effective habits of intelligent interpreta- 
tion. . 
The conclusions which have been presented are tentative. The find- 
ings on which they are based need to be verified through more refined 
measures of progress. Furthermore, there is need of more detailed 
analyses of the phases of interpretation which should be cultivated; exact 
measures of the progress obtained in each phase are also necessary. 
The results of instruction under various school conditions and among 
pupils of different social types and levels of intelligence should be deter- 
mined. Finally, carefully controlled experiments are necessary in order 
to determine conditions under which each phase of interpretation can 
be emphasized to best advantage. 
CONDITIONS ACCOMPANYING DIFFERENCES IN COMPREHENSION 
Wide differences in achievement revealed by surveys—One of the 
significant facts revealed by recent surveys of reading is the wide differ- 
ences in achievement among schools. A striking example of such differ- 
ences is shown in Figure 3 (128: 185), which represents the average 
comprehension scores for St. Louis, Cleveland, and thirteen other cities as 
measured by the Gray Silent Reading Tests. 
The figure shows that St. Louis attained a level of achievement 
distinctly above the average for thirteen cities, while Cleveland made an 
unsatisfactory record very much below the average. The difference in 
achievement between Cleveland and St. Louis is impressive. The differ- 
ence in the achievement of the best and poorest schools in each city is 
even greater. Such facts are not peculiar to the cities mentioned. Similar 
conditions have been found in practically every reading survey that has 
been made. 
The discovery of the causes of differences in the progress of pupils 
presents a very important problem. One method which has been used 
widely in the study of this problem is the analysis of test records to 
determine conditions that have accompanied differences in comprehen~ 
sion. It is the purpose of this section to present the results of several such 
studies. The evidence available does not show that the conditions 
described were the sole causes of the differences in achievement. The 
fact that certain conditions frequently accompanied differences in achieve- 
ment justifies the conclusion that they should be given consideration in 
efforts to determine the causes of good or poor work, 
1. Experience and training of teachers.—In a study (322) made in the 
state of Iowa the Monroe Silent Reading Tests were given to 166 classes
-P-A-G-E-107
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 99 
of third- fourth- and fifth-grade pupils. By means of a questionnaire, 
information was secured concerning “the number of years of teaching 
experience and the number of years of school training beyond the eighth 
grade each teacher had had,” The results showed that teaching experi- 
ence up to eight or nine years is valuable. The loss following that time 
is distinct. Nevertheless, teachers of long experience are “still equal to or 
better than younger teachers with five years or less of experience.” The 
results also showed that increased training on the part of teachers was 
accompanied by higher and higher comprehension scores on the part of

pupils. It should be remembered that these conclusions are based on 
averages and that there were wide variations from these general tendencies 
in individual cases. 
2. Size of school.—State-wide surveys indicate that the pupils in the 
larger city schools read better than pupils attending schools in smaller 
cities and rural communities. Greene concluded from data secured in a 
survey of reading in Iowa that “there seems to be an increase in the 
efficiency in silent-reading comprehension as the size of the city in which 
the school is located increases. Consolidated schools and the small town 
schools have a larger proportion of grades below standard. Schools in 
cities of over 10,000, on the other hand, have practically all grades
-P-A-G-E-108
100 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
above the Monroe mid-year standard” (146: 42-43). Additional evidence 
of the superiority of reading accomplishment in larger cities was secured 
in the Virginia survey (397: 21), which showed that the average rural 
child was “from one to two or more years behind where he should be for 
his age.” Wide differences between the achievements of city and rural 
children were also found in the Indiana state survey (190: 7) and in the 
survey of the schools of Santa Clara County, California (434: 62). 
Studies have also been made of the average achievements of pupils 
in schools with one, two, three, four, five, and six or more teachers. In a 
survey of reading (72: 11) in the New York rural schools, it was found 
that the one-teacher rural schools scored markedly below the neighboring 
village schools having four or more teachers. In the Virginia state survey 
(397: 22-23) the white pupils of the four-teacher schools were about one 
year younger and scored higher grade by grade than the pupils in the 
one-, two-, and three-teacher schools, The evidence was not so clear in 
the case of the colored pupils. In the Indiana survey (190: 6) it was found 
that the township schools having two and three teachers and the con- 
solidated schools having four, five, or six teachers secured better results 
than the one-teacher schools. 
These findings justify the conclusion that, in general, there is a 
positive relation between the size of the school and achievement in compre- 
hension. The fact should be kept in mind, however, that differences in 
the size of schools may be accompanied by differences in other significant 
factors, such as the preparation of the teachers, the time devoted to 
reading, the amount of reading, race, and economic stability. 
3. Emphasis in teaching.—Figure 3 showed that St. Louis and Cleve- 
land differed widely in their average comprehension scores. Observations 
of classroom instruction in these cities revealed the fact that emphasis 
in teaching reading also differed radically. 
In connection with the Cleveland survey it was shown that the formal 
aspects of reading were given great emphasis while the thought side received 
relatively less emphasis. It will be shown in the further discussion of the St. 
Louis results that St. Louis not only emphasizes the formal aspects of reading 
but in addition devotes a relatively large amount of attention to the thoughtful 
mastery of the printed page [132: 163]. 
4. Amount of reading —In a study by Hunt (188) the pupils of a 
fourth-grade class were classified into two groups on the basis of the 
amount of outside reading which they did. The “extensive readers” 
read one or more books a week other than texts, while the “non-readers’’ 
did only a very little outside reading. When the Monroe Silent Reading
-P-A-G-E-109
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION IOI 
Test was given, the extensive readers not only scored higher in rate but 
made a comprehension score of 9.5 as compared with 5.4 for the non- 
readers. In a subsequent study, including three seventh-grade classes, 
both the Otis Group Intelligence Test and the Monroe Silent Reading 
Test were given. The intelligence scores for the entire group ranged 
from 40 to 143, with a median of 91. The median score of the non-readers 
was go. The extensive readers again scored relatively high in both rate 
and comprehension. The scores in comprehension were 23.5 for the 
extensive readers and 17.1 for the non-readers. In view of the apparent 
equality of the two groups in intelligence, the amount of reading done un- 
doubtedly affected, to a greater or less extent, the achievement of these 
pupils in comprehension. 
Hilliard (170: 29) found a correlation of .159 between the total 
number of pages read during the year by fifth-grade pupils and their scores 
on the Thorndike-McCall test. Theisen (368) found correlations between 
the number of books read during the year and scores on the Haggerty 
Reading Examination, Sigma 1. The correlation was .47 and .44 for 
Test 1 and Test 2, respectively, in the case of 210 first-grade pupils and 
-14 and .og, respectively, in the case of 190 second-grade pupils. It is 
evident that numerous factors are involved in such studies which make 
it difficult to determine the specific effect of the amount read without the 
use of more elaborate statistical calculations. There is sufficient evidence 
to justify the conclusion that there is a greater or less degree of positive 
correlation between the amount read and comprehension scores. 
5. Race.—In the survey of the Memphis school system (64: 73) the 
~ achievements of white and colored children were compared through the 
use of the Monroe Silent Reading Tests. The white children scored 
higher in every grade except the third and the fifth. In the Virginia state 
survey (397: 10) it was found that “the colored city pupils are one and a 
half years behind the city white pupils in reading achievement.” In the 
one-room schools the colored pupils scored lower than the white pupils. 
“In the two-teacher, three-teacher, and four-teacher schools they read 
with greater ability than do the white pupils.” An examination of their 
age records revealed the fact that they were from one to three years older 
than the Virginia average. When both age records and reading scores are 
considered, the pupils in rural colored schools did relatively poorly. : 
In a study (371: 38) of comprehension made in a Chicago school 
three types of pupils were represented, namely, colored children who had 
been reared in Chicago, white children who had been reared in the same 
section of the city, and colored children who had been reared in the South
-P-A-G-E-110

and had received some of their school training there. The results showed. 
that there was very little difference in achievement in comprehension be- 
tween the white and colored groups reared in Chicago. The colored 
group reared in the South scored lower on the average than did the 
other groups. These facts indicate that comparisons between races are 
undoubtedly complicated by factors other than race differences. 
6. Nationality—In a survey of reading in Newark, New Jersey 
(274: 23-24), in which the Monroe Silent Reading Test was used, it was 
found that of three groups, the American children ranked highest, the 
Hebrew children second, and the Italian children lowest. The only excep- 
tion to this statement relates to the third grade, in which the Hebrew 
children ranked highest. In the St. Louis survey (132: 172) it was found 
that the foreign-speaking children made lower comprehension scores than 
the English-speaking children. The Hebrew children were an exception 
to this statement. These findings indicate that various nationalities en- 
counter different degrees of difficulty in learning to read English intel- 
ligently. 
7. Sex.—The results of comparative studies indicate that, in general, 
boys make somewhat higher comprehension scores than do girls on the 
tests which have been used. In the St. Louis survey (132: 172) the differ- 
ence in achievement was equal to the normal growth made in from two to 
five months. 
8. Summer vacation—In a study by Brueckner and Distad, the 
comprehension of the pupils of twelve first-grade classes in four schools 
was measured in June and September with the Minneapolis Primary 
Reading Test and the Haggerty Reading Examination, Sigma 1, the same 
forms of the tests being used at each testing period. The pupils were 
classified into three groups—A, B, and C—on the basis of the length of 
time they had attended school—twelve, twenty-four, or thirty-six weeks. 
The Detroit Kindergarten Test was used in measuring the intelligence 
of 129 pupils of the C group. A comparison of the scores showed that, 
on the average, there was very little difference between the June and the 
September scores for the I B and I A pupils. 
In general, the I C pupils who scored the highest on the Detroit Kinder- 
garten Test made the highest scores on the Minneapolis Primary Reading Test. 
The losses from June to September on the Minneapolis Primary Reading Test 
seem to indicate that the pupils with low intelligence scores lost the most in 
reading ability [44: 707]. 
In general, the tests showed that the pupils neither gained nor lost 
as a result of the summer vacation. The fact that there were wide
-P-A-G-E-111
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 103 
individual differences with respect to this matter presents a problem for 
further investigation. 
9. The study of first-year Latin—The Thorndike-McCall Reading 
Scale, Form 2, was given to “several thousand pupils in over a hundred 
different high schools” (382). Other forms of the same test were given 
at or near the end of the first half-year and the end of the school year. A 
comparative study was made of the progress in comprehension, as 
measured by these tests, of the pupils who studied first-year Latin and 
of the pupils who did not. The results showed that the former group did 
better during the first half-year. Neither group excelled during the second 
half-year. As Thorndike pointed out, it is difficult to explain the lack of 
superior progress during the second half-year on-the part of the pupils 
studying Latin if the study of this subject was responsible for a part or 
all of their gain during the first half-year. . 
Concluding statements.—The findings of the investigations that have 
been summarized show that differences in comprehension are frequently 
due to such facts as differences in teaching emphasis, in the amount read, 
in the training and experience of the teachers, in the size of the school, 
and in the race, nationality, and sex of the pupils. On the other hand, a 
summer’s vacation does not seem to affect noticeably the achievement 
of first-grade pupils, and it is doubtful if the study of first-year Latin is 
directly responsible for much improvement in comprehension on the part 
of high-school Freshmen. These and other factors should be studied in 
greater detail in order to determine more fully and accurately the condi- 
tions that accompany differences in achievement. 
RELATION OF SPECIFIC FACTORS TO COMPREHENSION 
Types of studies considered—A second method of determining the | 
conditions that favor or interfere with progress in ability to comprehend 
is to make detailed studies of the relation of specific factors to comprehen- 
sion. Several investigations of this type will be summarized. Unfortu- 
nately, all of the conditions have been controlled in only a few studies. 
Consequently, it is not clear in many cases that the relationships de- 
scribed or the changes effected in comprehension scores are due entirely 
to the factors under investigation; neither is it clear that the measures 
employed determine accurately the entire effect of a given factor. Fur- 
thermore, very few investigations have been repeated under comparable 
conditions. Nevertheless, the results of these studies are very suggestive. 
They identify clearly certain conditions that must be considered in any 
effort to improve comprehension.
-P-A-G-E-112
104 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Relation of six factors to comprehension. —In a survey of the literature 
concerning silent reading, Hilliard (170) secured a list of twelve possible 
factors affecting comprehension, namely, low general intelligence, in- 
sufficient vocabulary, faulty rate of reading, inability to reproduce 
material read, lip-movements and articulation, lack of organization 
ability, poor envitonment, too little reading practice, poor school attend- 
ance, small recognition span, lack of motivation, and inability to Zeason. 
A study was then made of the relation of the first six of these fatters to 
achievement in comprehension. The remaining six were not considered 
because satisfactory methods of isolating them could not be devised. A 
battery of tests was given to twenty-five pupils in one fifth-grade class. 
The tests included four comprehension tests, three group intelligence 
tests, five vocabulary tests, the Greene English Organization Test, the 
Whipple ‘Dutch Homestead” reading and reproduction test, and several 
tests of rate of reading. Essentially the same tests were given to 136 
pupils in four other fifth-grade classes. The scores made on each group 
of tests were correlated with the comprehension scores. The measures 
of lip-movement were such that they could not be used in correlation 
studies. 
The results showed that there is positive correlation between compre- 
hension and each of the five factors included in the study. “The zero 
order of correlations reaffirms this relationship and shows the following 
order of importance among them: intelligence, vocabulary, organization, 
rate, reproduction. The first and second order correlations and the regres- 
sion equations of the second order lessep the importance of organization 
asa factor in comprehension” (170: 58). Every phase of the study supplied 
evidence of the very large importance of intelligence and an adequate 
vocabulary. 
Gates (103) made a study of the correlation between achievement on 
two vocabulary tests and achievement on five comprehension tests. The 
correlations ranged from .32 to .65 except in the case of the Brown read- 
ing test, which has been severely criticized as a valid measure of achieve- 
ment in comprehension. Although Gates’s groups were small, a fact which 
renders his correlations less reliable, his results clearly support the genera] 
conclusions of Hilliard concerning the positive relation between compre- 
hension and vocabulary. 
Clear objectives in the teaching of reading—In the spring of 1919 the 
Monroe, Courtis, and Gray reading tests were given to the pupils of 
Rochester, New York (160). The scores were very satisfactory with 
respect to oral reading and rate of silent reading but were decidedly low
-P-A-G-E-113
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 105 
in comprehension. The fifth and sixth grades ranked especially low. 
Accordingly, three sixth-grade classes, including 109 pupils, were selected 
for special work. “Daily reading for accurate reproduction, required for 
a variety of purposes, was practiced. Each week an informal test was 
given which demanded the same activities as the Gray tests.” Specific 
attention was also given to the needs of individual pupils. At the end 
of twenty-two weeks the Gray tests were repeated. ‘The results showed 
that the pupils had increased “their quality of reading 43 per cent under 
intensive training for that purpose.” They also improved five times as 
much in oral reading as the normal growth in the same period of time and 
made some improvement in rate. The fact should be pointed out that the 
amount of improvement recorded may be unduly large owing to the use 
of the same tests before and after the practice period. Nevertheless, this 
study supplies evidence of the value of clear objectives in the teaching 
of reading. 
Increasing the amount read.—In a preliminary study of achievement 
in silent reading in the schools of Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana (95), it 
was found that the average number of basal texts per grade was 2.75 and 
that the average number of collateral books required was 2.55. The 
. scores made on the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Tests were 
unusually low in all grades in both rate and comprehension. A campaign 
was inaugurated to increase the number of books for each grade. It was 
recommended that, in general, basal texts be used in the morning period 
and supplementary books in the afternoon period. The amount of reading 
done in 1922-23 is shown in Table XXXVIII (95: 34). When the ~ 
“Monroe Revised Reading Tests” were given a month before the close 
of the 1922-23 session, it was found that the pupils approximated the 
standard scores in rate of reading and that they were noticeably above 
the standard in comprehension in every grade except the seventh. This 
study illustrates not only the value of an increased amount of reading 
but also the value of working toward a definite objective in supervi- 
sion. 
Additional evidence of the value of extensive reading in school was 
secured by Maple (251) in Vincennes, Indiana. He compared the report 
for all grades made by the school librarian four months after the adoption 
of the plan of extensive reading with the report made a year earlier, The 
reports show “an increase in non-fiction read by pupils of 110 per cent 
and of the juvenile fiction of ror per cent.’”’ Every teacher was impressed 
with the fact that the pupils exhibited “an increased interest in reading 
and better judgment in selecting material.”
-P-A-G-E-114
106 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Knowledge of results —Twenty-three young women in Davenport Col- 
lege engaged in ten practice exercises each day for five days to improve 
their ability in silent reading (157). Each student read for thirty seconds 
and then wrote an account of what she had read. The reproduction was 
scored by the reader so that she knew her standing at the end of each 
exercise. The average number of ideas reproduced by the students on 
each of the five successive days follows: first day, 19.4; second day, 20.9; 
third day, 24.3; fourth day, 25.2; and fifth day, 28.7. Harrelson attributes 
most of the gain to the method used, the student being informed as to her 
progress and constantly working against her own record. Similar studies 
should be made with elementary-school children in efforts to determine 
methods of improving comprehension.

  Concluding statements—The foregoing discussion shows that the 
general intelligence of pupils and their mastery of a meaning vocabulary 
are intimately related to progress in comprehension, that the establish- 
ment of clear objectives in teaching comprehension accompanied by a 
vigorous program of good teaching is a very important step in securing 
progress, that increasing the amount read may improve comprehension, 
and that a knowledge of the results of practice is valuable, particularly 
in the case of adults. Experiments of the type summarized are very 
productive. However, the tentative conclusions which have been sum- 
marized should be verified in other experiments. The influence of many 
of the factors and conditions referred to in the previous section should 
also be subjected to similar study. It is particularly desirable in all such 
investigations to determine the effect of given conditions on various 
types of pupils.
-P-A-G-E-115
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 107 
EFFECT OF SPECIFIC METHODS AND TRAINING TECHNIQUES 
ON ABILITY TO INTERPRET WHAT IS READ 
Problems for consideration.—Various experiments have been reported 
which show the results of the use of different methods and devices in 
promoting the development of habits of intelligent reading. For the most 
part, these experiments have been carried on in regular classrooms 
where it was difficult to control all the conditions. Furthermore, very 
few studies to which reference will be made have been repeated under 
similar conditions. The only conclusion, therefore, that can be drawn 
from studies of this type is that the method or device employed proved 
effective under the conditions described. On the other hand, the results are 
very interesting and suggest numerous problems for further investigation. 
Silent-reading poster lessons and directions for individual seat work 
(first grade).—Two methods have been used by one first-grade teacher 
(340): (zr) silent-reading poster lessons based on experience and (2) direc- 
tions for individual seat work, which was carefully checked. The Hag- 
gerty Reading Examination, Sigma 1, was given in February before the 
training began. When the test was repeated two months later, the scores 
had more than doubled. It is impossible to determine from the experiment 
whether the accelerated growth was due to the specific methods employed, 
to the added enthusiasm of the teacher, or to the effect of practice in 
taking a given test. It is evident, however, that the various methods 
used secured improvement. 
Sileni-reading instruction supplemented by other devices (first grade).— 
An experiment by Marks (252) included twenty-nine first-grade children 
and continued for two semesters with the summer vacation intervening. 
The children came from modest, but well-kept, homes. Approximately 
half the parents were foreign-born, the prevailing nationalities being 
German and Russian. The method used emphasized silent reading for 
meaning. In addition, many games and devices were used, such as follow- 
ing directions, answering questions, completing sentences, and matching 
cards according to meanings. Phonetics was introduced and used when 
the need for it was felt, At the end of the year the class averaged marked- 
ly higher than the first-grade standard. From a practical point of view, 
these results are very gratifying. It is impossible to determine, however, 
the specific conditions that were primarily responsible for the unusually 
rapid growth. 
Motivated drill in silent reading (third grade)——An experiment by 
Hoover (175) included 1,139 third-grade children in thirty different class- 
rooms. They were divided into two groups, 571 in non-drill sections and
-P-A-G-E-116
108 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
568 in drill sections, on the basis of teachers’ judgments as to “mental 
attainments” and scores made on the Monroe Standardized Silent Read- 
ing Test. Fifteen of the sections were provided with four kinds of prac- 
tice exercises, namely, “Action Cards,” “Language Response Cards,” 
“Pretense Cards” and “One-Word Response Cards.” This material was 
used by the drill section for ten minutes on each of three days each week. 
During the remainder of the reading period the usual type of training 
was given. Both groups devoted the same amount of time each day to 
reading or to reading and drill. The experiment continued for three 
months. At the end of that time the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading 
Test was repeated, The records showed that the non-drill sections in- 
creased their median comprehension score from 3.9 to 7.0; the drill sec- 
tions increased their median comprehension score from 4.0 to 9.0. The 
most important contribution of this study is a clear demonstration of the 
fact that improvement in specific types of interpretation can be secured 
if definite effort is made to vitalize teaching. The statement should be 
added, however, that reliance should not be placed on the use of a limited 
number of devices. 
< Adapting instruction to group and individual needs (fourth grade).— 
The Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test, Form 1, was given to 
forty-three pupils in Grade IV A in September (418). The pupils were 
divided into three groups: Group A included seven pupils who made the 
standard score or better; Group B included twenty-two pupils whose 
scores indicated third-grade ability; Group C included fourteen pupils who 
were two or more grades below standard. “Daily reading drills for accurate 
reproduction of ideas were begun in each group. The work was differ- 
entiated to meet not only the group needs but also the needs of the indi- 
viduals.” The material used was primarily narration, Groups A and B 
using books in history, hygiene, and geography, and Group C using basic 
or supplementary first- and second-grade readers. The silent-reading 
lessons were supplemented by drill in word analysis and phonetics and 
by flash-card exercises to increase the span of recognition. Frequent 
informal tests were given to check speed and comprehension. At the 
end of ten weeks the Monroe test, Form 2, was given. Definite improve- 
ment was shown in the scores of thirty-seven of the forty-three pupils. 
“The class median was higher, and nineteen pupils were now above 
standard.” Only four remained in Group C. These four were given 
special help each day following the test; the same procedure as before was 
continued with Groups A and B. Two months later the Monroe test, 
Form 1, was given again. The results now “showed twenty-five pupils
-P-A-G-E-117
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION Tog 
up to standard or better, as compared with nineteen in November and 
seven in September. .... The number one grade below standard was 
reduced to fourteen, as compared with twenty in November and twenty- 
two in September. The number two or more grades below standard was 
four, as compared with four in November and fourteen in September.” 
However, three of these four pupils showed definite improvement between 
November and January. , 
The lesson taught by this study is that the plan of adapting instruc- 
tion to meet the needs of small groups and of individual pupils proves very 
effective. Additional evidence of the value of this type of work is found 
in the reports of other studies (88, 241, 400, 435). Investigation has not 
been carried far enough to determine the specific measures which are 
most appropriate in the case of all types of difficulties. 
Emphasizing the elements on which meaning depends (fourth and sixth 
grades).—In an experiment reported by C. T. Gray (124: 160-62) a 
fourth-grade boy and a sixth-grade boy were used as subjects. The train- 
ing “consisted in reading selections carefully with a view to emphasizing 
those elements on which the meaning depended. Such matters were 
discussed as topic sentences, relational words, effect of different types of 
modifying phrases, etc. In short, an attempt was made to give the 
subjects a feeling for language.” Practice continued for twenty days, the 
time each day being from twenty to thirty minutes. There was a gain in 
comprehension in the case of one subject in two out of three tests; there 
was a loss in all three tests in the case of the other subject. These results 
supply striking evidence of the fact that training which is very effective 
in the case of one pupil may not meet the needs of another or may require 
a different form of presentation in order to prove effective. 
Practice on the exercises of standardized tests (third to sixth grade, in- 
clusive).—Gates (105) reports the results of five practice periods for five 
minutes each day in Grades III to VI, inclusive, on exercises taken from 
different forms of the Burgess Scale for Measuring Ability in Silent 
Reading. The improvement averaged about 15 per cent. In a second 
experiment in which passages from four forms of the Thorndike-McCall 
scale were used for seven days the results showed no improvement. In 
explanation, Gates states that “it may be that practice sufficient to 
develop maximal power of comprehension is supplied by the ordinary 
experiences of home and school.” This may have been true in the case of 
the pupils included in this study. Evidence that training to increase depth 
of comprehension may prove effective was secured in the experiment 
which is described in the following paragraph.
-P-A-G-E-118
110 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Increasing meaning vocabulary, selecting central thoughts of paragraphs 
and organizing them in logical sequence, and retaining and reproducing the 
important points read (fourth to eighth grade, inclusive) —The Thorndike- 
McCall Reading Scale, Form 1, was given by Alderman (4) to 3,20r pupils 
in seventy-five classrooms selected from Grades IV to VIII, inclusive. 
The pupils of each class were then divided into drill and non-drill sections. 
Instructions were given to the teachers providing for no change in the 
character of the work done by the non-drill sections and for three types of 
training for the drill sections, namely, training in increasing the mean- 
ing vocabulary, in selecting the central thoughts of paragraphs and in 
organizing them in logical sequence, and in retaining and reproducing 
the important points read. Thirty minutes was given daily to reading by 
both sections in all classes. The training continued for three weeks on 
each of the three types of work outlined. At the end of each practice 
period different forms of the Thorndike-McCall scale were given. A 
preliminary summary of the findings led to the conclusion that “compre- 
hension ability in silent reading as measured by the Thorndike-McCall 
Scale may be improved to a degree equivalent to nearly one semester 
of work in Grades IV to VIII by careful, systematic drill work covering 
a period of six consecutive weeks, provided that thirty minutes each day 
is devoted to this type of work.” It was also found that selecting central] 
thoughts and organizing them were of most value to the average readers 
as well as to the poor readers, while the vocabulary study was of most 
value to the better readers. Further experimentation is necessary before 
these conclusions can be accepted as final. 
Providing teachers with numerous suggestions from which to select 
methods appropriate for their classes.—Rhodes (317) gave the Burgess 
Scale for Measuring Ability in Silent Reading, Form 2, to the pupils in a 
training school from Grades III to VITI, inclusive. The results showed. 
that the pupils “throughout the school were apparently reading too 
slowly and certainly not with the desired accuracy.” As a first step in 
remedying this situation, numerous suggestions were collected from teach- 
ers. Rhodes classified these suggestions under the following headings: 
“to train pupils to judge relative values,” “to train pupils to find the 
organization of the thought of a selection,” “comprehension,” “rate of 
reading,” and “provision for practice in silent reading.” Each teacher 
selected those methods and devices which, in her judgment, were most 
appropriate for her pupils. The improvement from January to June 
brought most of the grades up to standard. The improvement was great- 
est in the third grade and least in the seventh and eighth grades. As
-P-A-G-E-119
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 111 
Rhodes points out, “the exact proportion of improvement which was due 
to the special technique employed cannot be definitely determined.” 
Undoubtedly, the interest aroused among the teachers and the provision 
of numerous suggestions concerning the technique of teaching silent 
reading were important factors. 
Practice in reading arithmetic problems (sixth grade)—When a sixth- 
grade group (421) which ranked relatively low on an intelligence test was 
given the Stone Reasoning Test, the pupils made unsatisfactory scores. 
For a period of five weeks the class “devoted ten minutes three times a 
week to the reading of problems.” The pupils were provided with ques- 
tions concerning each problem which aided them in determining the mean- 
ing. The Stone Reasoning Test was given again at the close of the training 
period. The results showed that there was improvement in the case of a 
large percentage of the pupils and that the class average was raised from 
below standard to above standard. 
While it is impossible to determine exactly the extent to which the specific 
training in reading is responsible for the improvement shown, the teacher 
believes it contributed very largely thereto, since she practically confined 
explanation to the making and answering of questions in the preliminary reading 
and to very simple acting-out of the problems where the questions failed to 
make the situation vivid [421: 384]. 
It is possible that some of the improvement was due to the fact that 
the interval between the tests was too brief to eliminate the effect of 
familiarity with the test. 
Developing motives for improvement, securing favorable conditions for 
practice, studying the factors of success, diagnosing and removing hindrances, 
and securing persistence in practice (college students) —Stone (359) reports 
the results of an experiment to improve the reading ability of college 
students in fifteen classes, two of which served as check groups. The initial 
reading ability of the students was determined through the use of the 
Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test, Test III, and Stone’s exten- 
sions of it. Motives for improvement were developed. A study was made 
of the factors conditioning success. Definite practice assignments were 
made. Each student was encouraged and aided in the diagnosis of his 
own difficulties, and every effort was made to secure persistence in 
practice. At the end of three weeks the students were again tested. The 
results showed clearly the superiority of each of the practice groups. 
“Students of Education 25 are here seen to have made nearly twice as 
much gain in comprehension as students of Education 1 (partial-practice 
group) and nearly four times as much as the students of Education 10
-P-A-G-E-120
112 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
(check group).” Inasmuch as numerous methods were employed in 
securing improvement, it is impossible to draw any conclusions concerning 
the relative merits of the various plans adopted. 
Controlled practice, self-analysis with regard to study habits, and study 
of the psychology of reading (college students).—Stone and Colvin (360) 
arranged for twenty hours of controlled practice in reading for forty-five 
students in educational psychology in addition to critical examinations 
of their own study habits and systematic study of the psychology of silent 
reading. “As measured by the Monroe Silent Reading Test with Stone’s 
Extensions, their average rate score after practice and study was 74 per 
cent gain over that of average scores before practice and study”; their 
average improvement in comprehension was 84 per cent. Some individ- 
uals gained as much as 190 per cent in comprehension. It is significant 
that the “students with the lowest initial scores made the greatest gains.’”” 
This indicates that many poor readers among college students are making 
use of habits which can be improved through the use of appropriate 
methods. 
Concluding statements—The type of experimentation illustrated in 
this section is very productive. It shows that numerous specific proce- 
dures have proved effective in increasing comprehension in given situa- 
tions. Because conditions vary widely in classrooms, teachers should 
‘ always take the attitude of inquiry and investigation toward the problems 
of teaching reading. There is urgent need at the present time of the 
development of a simple technique of classroom experimentation which 
will enable teachers to make studies and to secure accurate measures of 
the value of different methods of teaching. 
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS OF DIFFERENT STUDY PROCEDURES 
IN WORK-TYPE READING 
Type of studies included.—It is the purpose of this section to sum- 
marize the results of investigations of the merits of different study proce- 
dures in reading factual or so-called “content” material. Only a limited 
number of such investigations have been reported. Each method studied 
is rarely compared with more than one other method. Furthermore, the 
results secured have not been verified through similar experiments with 
other groups. These are serious limitations; nevertheless, the results are 
suggestive concerning desirable procedures in reading and studying 
content subjects. 
Reading with and without determination to remember what is read-—An 
experiment by Peterson (294), which belongs in reality to studies in the
-P-A-G-E-121
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 113 
field of memory, supplies indirect evidence of the value of reading with 
determination to remember. The study dealt with two classes taking the 
same course in psychology. Twenty words were written on the board, 
copied by the students, and read by the teacher while the students 
checked their copied lists. They were then asked to fold their papers and 
write down all the words of the list that they could remember. The experi- 
ment was repeated with the following differences in procedure: the stu- 
dents were informed at the beginning that they would be asked to re- 
produce the list; they were encouraged to do as well as they could; and 
they were informed that ranks would be assigned on the basis of achieve- 
ment. “Conditions of time and of emphasis on the three kinds of impres- 
sions—visual, auditory, and motor-tactual—were kept as nearly constant 
in both cases as possible.” Two days later the students were asked to 
write down all the words of either list that they could remember. The 
results showed that in one section immediate reproduction was 14.8 per 
cent better with determination than without determination and that 
delayed reproduction was 48.4 per cent better with determination than 
without determination. The results for the second section were still more 
favorable to the plan of reading with determination to remember and to 
do well in the test. Peterson attributes the superiority of reading with 
determination to better associations and to more intense effort. 
The effect on immediate recall in the case of reading with and without a 
preliminary test—Yoakum (432) classified the pupils of four schools in 
Grades IV to VIII, inclusive, into three groups—A, B, and C—according 
to the teachers’ judgments of their ability to read. Equal proportions 
of good, medium, and poor readers were assigned to each section. “Group 
A was given an initial test, allowed to read the article once, and then 
given an immediate recall. Group B was not given an initial test but 
read the article once and then took an immediate recall test. Group C 
read the article once but performed no test of previous knowledge nor of 
immediate recall. Then, after a lapse of some days or weeks, all three 
groups were given a delayed recall.” The tests given in the initial test, in 
the immediate recall, and in the delayed recall were the same. They in- 
cluded a “controlled completion test” and questions requiring brief 
written answers. The results showed that the immediate recall was much 
better when the reading was preceded by the initial test and that the 
delayed recall was much better when the reading was followed by an 
immediate recall. 
As Yoakum points out, the validity of the conclusions depends in 
part on the assumption that the groups were equal in ability. The experi-
-P-A-G-E-122
Img INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
ment should be repeated with carefully selected groups. Furthermore, 
’ the fact that the same test was used before and after the reading was 
unfortunate. The pretesting was undoubtedly of value in helping the 
pupils to answer the same questions after reading. No measure was 
‘obtained of the amount of information each group secured from their 
reading that was not specifically called for in the test. In subsequent 
investigations a variety of tests of interpretation should be given immedi- 
ately following the reading, as well as in the delayed recall, in order to 
secure more complete measures of interpretation and retention. 
Effect of reading with and without explanations, demonstrations, and 
the stimulation of interest on ability to answer questions based on material 
read.—Bird (24) assigned a chapter on the nervous system to one hundred 
normal-school students with the direction that it was “to be learned in 
preparation for a written test.” On the following day a test, including 
twenty factual questions which could be answered briefly, was given. “The 
next semester, to another group of one hundred students with the same 
general ability and preparation the same lesson was assigned, preceded 
by careful explanation of all the difficult parts, supplemented by the use 
of a model of a brain and also a preserved human specimen for illustration 
—in all amounting to a supervised-study period of over half an hour, 
aiming to arouse interest in the subject.” The test which had been given 
the preceding semester was used again on the day following the assign- 
ment. A comparison of the scores of the two groups showed that the 
half-hour preparation had proved very effective. The average score for 
the group with preparation was 74.1 per cent, as compared with 54.15 
per cent for the group without preparation. In commenting on the results, 
Bird stated that they supply evidence in favor of careful assignments 
made during supervised-study periods to arouse interest and to stimulate 
effort. It is unfortunate that no objective data are included concerning 
the abilities of the students of each group and concerning the total amount 
of time given by each group to the preparation of the assignment. 
Undirected study as compared with specific training (1) in finding the 
| feentral thought of a paragraph, (2) in determining the questions one should 
’ be able to answer about a topic, and (3) in reading an entire block of material 
for its general plan.—Beauchamp (18) conducted:a series of experiments 
with two ninth-grade classes in general science in order to determine the 
relative merits of undirected study and each of three directed-study 
procedures. The experiments were carried on in connection with the study 
, of different units of subject-matter. Although it was impossible to pair 
the pupils, the groups were compared with respect to size of class, age,
-P-A-G-E-123
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION rig 
native intelligence, rate of reading, and ability to comprehend. When the 
same study directions were given to each group, there was very little 
difference in achievement, thus indicating that the two groups were com- 
parable in ability so far as the purposes of the experiment were con- 
cerned. The achievements of the pupils at the end of each experiment 
were determined by means of a written report, a completion test, and 
carefully graded thought questions. 
The results showed that each of the three methods of directed study 
secured a more thorough comprehension of the subject-matter than un- 
directed study of the same material. Because the subject-matter and the Y 
tests used in the different experiments were unstandardized, it was im- 
possible to determine which of the three directed-study procedures was 
the most effective. An examination of the results showed that each study 
procedure led to superior results in certain respects. For example, picking 
out the outstanding ideas of a selection led to superior organization of the 
written report. Determining questions one should be able to answer about 
a topic directed attention to details, However, “it was not more efficient 
in obtaining an understanding of the technical terms or of the major 
relationships, or in the application of the principles learned in solving 
thought questions.”’ Reading an entire block of material for its general 
plan and then grouping around this plan the major facts presented “was 
not only efficient in increasing the total number of ideas gained from study 
but was efficient in the mastery of technical terms and the important 
ideas contained in the subject-matter.” These facts make it clear that 
we must not only determine experimentally that a given procedure is good 
or poor; we must also determine the specific merits and limitations that 
attach to it. 
Specific training and practice in answering thought questions as com- 
pared with incidental training in answering such questions —Beauchamp 
(28) included in the series of experiments to which reference has just 
been made an investigation of the value of training and practice in solving 
thought questions as compared with no specific training of this type. For 
three weeks the pupils of one group spent ten minutes at the beginning 
of each period in training and practice. At the end of this time a test was 
given, including sixteen questions involving the use of principles on 
which no training had been provided. The results revealed the superiority 
of training and practice. This is in harmony with natural expectation, 
since the test used in this experiment was a specific measure of the type 
of ability which had been cultivated through training and practice. 
A written paragraph summary as compared with the re-reading of an
-P-A-G-E-124
116 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
article-—Germane (113) divided nine hundred pupils of the sixth, seventh, 
and eighth grades into two groups on the basis of their comprehension 
scores in an informal reading test. Both groups of a grade in a given school 
worked at the same time in different rooms. Group A spent thirty 
minutes in reading and summarizing what was read. Group B spent the 
same time in reading and re-reading the selection assigned. At the end 
of the study period each group was given “the same rigid test of questions 
covering the content of the article.” 
One difficulty encountered in the administration of the test was due 
to the fact that so much time was required by the pupils in summarizing 
the material read that only the first half of it was completed in some cases. 
In order to overcome this difficulty a comparison was made of the scores 
of the two groups on the questions covering the first half of the selection. 
Furthermore, an analysis of the questions showed that some of them were 
thought questions and that others were pure memory questions. 
A comparison of the records of the two groups showed that the “re- 
reading of an article is a more economical method of study than the writ- 
ten paragraph summary, when each group studies the same amount of 
time.” This was true in almost every case, “whether the results were 
compared over the entire test, the first half of the test, over those ques- 
tions called ‘reason’ and ‘main’ questions, or over those styled ‘minor’ 
questions.” 
The corrected summary as compared with re-reading for the same period 
of time.—Germane carried on an experiment, somewhat similar to the one 
just described, in Grades V to IX, inclusive, of the elementary and junior 
high schools of the State University of Iowa. In this experiment the 
summarizing groups proceeded as follows: 
(1) The article is read as a whole. (2) A brief summary outline is written 
from memory. (3) The article is glanced over with a view to discovering what 
points of importance were forgotten or overlooked in the summary outline. (4) 
The summary outline is corrected by the adding of points omitted or by chang- 
ing statements in the original summary outline [r12: 461]. 
Thirty minutes were allowed for study by each group. 
Two rigorous tests were used to measure comprehension. The first was a 
question-and-answer test covering the material read and involving points of 
major and minor importance. The second was a recognition test. Four answers 
were suggested for each question, only one of which was correct, and the pupils 
were asked to underline the correct answer (112: 462]. 
The results showed that the re-reading group made consistently 
higher scores, ranging from 4.4 per cent to 20.4 per cent higher. “An
-P-A-G-E-125
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION I1z 
analysis of the corrected summaries of the majority of the pupils indicates 
that much of the thirty minutes was spent in indiscriminate note-taking.” 
It is evident, therefore, that the results secured are a measure of the value 
of re-reading as compared with the value of corrected summaries when 
the pupils are untrained in making and correcting summaries. 
A controlled mental summary as compared with re-reading —Germane 
(110) paired eighty-eight college students on the basis of scores made on 
the Monroe Standardized Reading Test. Group A read an article once, 
rapidly but carefully, and then mentally answered the questions of the 
test which was to be given later. If they were not sure of the answers, 
they were permitted to re-read. Group B read and re-read the article as 
many times as possible in the twenty minutes assigned. Both groups 
were then tested with the same questions which Group A had used during 
the study period. The results of the test were distinctly favorable to 
Group A. Unfortunately, no record was obtained of the meanings secured 
by Group B other than those involved in the answers to the questions. 
Consequently, the only conclusion which this experiment justifies is that 
the method pursued by Group A is distinctly superior if answers to specific 
questions are desired. 
Preparing written answers to questions when stimulated and directed 
by specific problems as compared with re-reading —Germane (x11) classified 
the pupils in Grades VI to IX of a “representative public school of Iowa” 
into two comparable groups on the basis of reading ability, as measured 
by the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test. The pupils of Group A 
were then given a list of questions which were to be answered after the 
selection which was used in the experiment had been read once. While 
writing the answers the pupils were permitted to re-read, if necessary. 
Thirty minutes were allowed for instructions and study. Group B spent 
the same time in reading and re-reading the selection. Each group was 
then given a test composed of the same questions used by Group A during 
the study period. The results showed that “presenting to the pupils a 
list of questions before reading the article and trying to arouse their 
interest in it is a somewhat more efficient method than the re-reading of 
the article.” Germane points out the fact that the pupils in Group A 
were not accustomed to the method of study assigned to them and 
consequently they lost much time. The results of this experiment are 
open to the same criticism pointed out in the case of the preceding 
experiment. 
Concluding statements.—The studies to which reference has been made 
suggest the following tentative conclusions concerning effective reading
-P-A-G-E-126
118 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
and study procedures: (1) The initial attitude of the reader is important. 
(2) Reading for specific purposes is much more effective than undirected 
study. (3) Specific training in a given study procedure is very valuable. 
(4) Study with specific problems in mind is more effective than undirected 
study or re-reading for the same period of time, provided the study 
problems form the achievement test. (5) A written paragraph summary 
or a corrected summary following the reading is less effective than re~ 
reading for the same period of time. 
These tentative conclusions are very suggestive. They should be 
verified under rigorous experimental conditions. Numerous other prob- 
lems relating to study procedures should be investigated. For example, 
What are the specific types or phases of interpretation cultivated by each 
study procedure? How may results be secured most economically and 
effectively in each case? What important individual differences are 
exhibited, and how may they be provided for best? 
RELATIVE MERITS OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF TEACHING LITERATURE 
Introductory statement —Only a very limited number of experiments . 
have been reported which relate to problems of teaching the intelligent 
interpretation and appreciation of literature. The experiments referred to 
in this section include some reference to such problems. They are sum- 
marized in detail here, even though they do not relate entirely to the 
- interpretation of what is read. 
The whole method of study as compared with the piecemeal examination 
of poems.—The most elaborate study of methods of teaching literature 
which has been reported was made by Hosic (180). His first step was to 
determine the views of experts concerning the aims and nature of litera- 
ture. His findings are well summarized by the statement that “imagina- 
tive realization of the piece as a whole as a means to enjoyment and to 
the enrichment of experience was found to be the central tendency.” He 
then examined four sets of reading books for Grades IV to VI to deter- 
mine the kinds of study helps provided. “The emphasis was found to fall 
upon the questions pertaining to the language used or the facts presented 
rather than upon conduct, technique, or expressional activities.” 
An analysis of eighteen stenographic lesson reports showed that the 
methods and questions employed by teachers are strikingly similar to 
those suggested in textbooks. 
In an experiment to determine the relative value of the whole method 
of study and the piecemeal examination of poems two sixth-grade classes 
were selected and designated as Class A and Class B. When the Kansas
-P-A-G-E-127
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION Irg 
Silent Reading Test was given, it was found that Class A presented a 
. wider range of ability but that Class B averaged somewhat higher. The 
- selections chosen for the experiment were four poems with which the 
pupils were not familiar. An effort was made to maintain uniform condi- 
tions throughout the experiment. 
Each class studied each of the four poems. While Class A studied one 
poem by the whole method, Class B studied it by the piecemeal method. 
When the second poem was introduced, the methods of study were 
reversed. After the four poems were completed, a written test was given. 
The answers showed that with one exception the pupils preferred the 
selections which had been taught by the whole method. They also showed 
that these poems were better understood. 
The conclusion is evident that the sort of contact with poetry which tended 
most strongly to a feeling of joy and satisfaction in the poems as pieces to hear 
or read again tended in nearly equal measure to produce a grasp of the meaning, 
the power of permanent recall, and a sense of understanding and mastery 
{z80: 7o]. 
When the experiment was repeated with slight modifications in the 
technique of piecemeal examination, the results of the first experiment 
were amply confirmed. 
These findings become doubly significant when the results of a supple- 
mentary study are considered. Two of the poems, “The Chambered 
Nautilus” and “The Tiger,” were read to a seventh-grade class. When 
asked for their preference, twenty-eight favored “The Tiger,” and four- 
teen favored “The Chambered Nautilus.” The vote in another seventh- 
grade class was thirty-four in favor of ‘The Tiger” and nine in favor of 
“The Chambered Nautilus.” The remaining two poems were also prt- 
sented to these two classes and the preferences of the pupils secured. 
Later all four poems were presented to other sixth- and seventh-grade 
classes. The results showed that the teachers who attempted in the 
experiment to establish, through the use of the whole method, a preference 
for “The Chambered Nautilus” and “How They Brought the Good 
News” were working under a handicap of four to one in the case of the 
former and five or six to one in the case of the latter. Nevertheless, in 
the experiment the pupils preferred the poems taught as wholes. 
Two general conclusions seem valid from the evidence in Hosic’s 
experiments: , 
A piecemeal attack on poetry with formal and ineffective reading aloud 
and much insistence upon the discussion of details of language, without any
-P-A-G-E-128
120 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
attempt to bring the pupils’ own experience to bear on the poem as a whole and 
without any final synthesis, is relatively ineffective as a method of teaching. 
Better results would be obtained by giving a vivid impression of the whole - 
to minds awakened to the possibilities and ready to interpret in the light of 
experience. A second reading of the whole is probably better than painstaking 
examination of details, especially if these are treated as unrelated items instead. 
of cumulative suggestions [180: 77]. 
Prescribed reading as compared with free reading in college English.— 
Two sections of college Freshmen in English were chosen for an experi-. 
ment which continued for ten weeks (66). One section (Section X) 
“proceeded on the usually accepted plan of definite assignments. ... . 
Methods of treatment, suggestions for study, topics and questions for 
the recitation hour were outlined ahead for the class and were in the hands 
of the students before each recitation period.” The section definitely 
organized for study and recitation read a number of standard English 
and American novels one after another. 
The plan of procedure for the second section (Section Y) follows: 
(x) The students were to read for the regular preparation periods as usual. 
(2) They were to choose their own reading in the field of English and American 
fiction. (3) They were requested to keep three lists as the term proceeded, one 
being a list of all they read for the course, a second of all they read outside of 
the course, and a third of the reading which they desired to do later on. (4) 
Reporting on reading was to be voluntary. (5) Groups for special reading and 
reporting were to be encouraged. (6) The atmosphere of a club was to be 
maintained. (7) The instructor was to become the general club chairman 
[66: 136]. 
A comparison of the amount read during the term by the two sections 
shows that “all the members of Section Y read as much as the required 
list for Section X and that nine-tenths of Section Y read more. The 
median amount read in the latter is 32.5 per cent more, while the greatest 
amount read in Section Y is exactly 100 per cent more’’ (66: 137). On the 
basis of these findings Cook emphasized the importance of providing for 
individual variations in rate of work. . 
An appreciation test was given to both sections at the end of the 
term. The test consisted in checking a list of sixty novels, “including 
many standard novels of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, some 
good current fiction, as well as some of the highly colored or sentimental 
variety.” The assignment was to check each novel as “worth reading 
twice,” “worth reading once,” “worth skimming rapidly,” or “not worth 
reading at all.” The checked lists when compared with the instructor’s
-P-A-G-E-129
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 121 
judgment showed that “the students of Section ¥, with few exceptions, 
not only rate classical novels higher but also show more discrimination 
with regard to current and popular fiction.” 
A significant difference between the two groups at the end of the 
term relates to their lists of proposed readings for the future. In the case 
of Section Y¥ there was a close correlation between the work of the course 
and the proposed readings for the future. There was strong interest 
evidenced in attacking social questions presented in such novels as The 
Man of Property. In the case of Section X, on the other hand, the pro- 
posed readings sometimes showed a rather “perfunctory interest” in the 
“authors read in the course”; their interest more often strayed to fields 
other than fiction and became “scattered and accidental” and sometimes 
limited in scope. 
Unfortunately, no statements are made concerning the initial prepara- 
tion and ability of each group. Furthermore, some of the measures of the 
results are more or less subjective. Nevertheless, the results are sugges- 
tive. They open up a whole field of interesting problems concerning the 
values which are to be derived from reading for recreation ~ 
values can be attained most readily and, particularly, hov 
appreciation of selections in the field of literature can be deveupeu.

CHAPTER XI 
SPEED OF SILENT READING 
Problems for consideration, —It is the purpose of this chapter to sum- 
marize the results of investigations that contribute to an understanding 
of problems relating to speed of silent reading. A preliminary analysis of 
the published studies shows that the most important results relate to 
the following topics: facts about the rate of reading, the relation between 
speed and comprehension, growth periods, factors that influence the speed. 
of reading, and types of practice that have proved effective in increas- 
ing speed. 
FACTS ABOUT RATE OF READING 
Rate varies widely among readers-—Huey (185: 174-75) found that . 
the adults whom he tested with very simple interesting passages varied 
in rate of reading from 2.5 to 9.8 words a second when readifig'silently at 
their ordinary rates. When reading as rapidly as possible, their rates 
varied from 3.5 to 13.5 words a second. Recent investigations have 
revealed even greater differences. It is not unusual to find pupils who 
read from eight to.ten times as rapidly as some of their classmates. For 
example, in a study of the records of 2,654 pupils (131: 113) it was found 
that second-grade pupils varied in rate of reading from .35 to 6 words a 
second; fifth-grade pupils varied from .83 to 8 words a second; and eighth- 
grade pupils varied from 1 to 8 words a second. Assuming that the 
quality of their reading was equally good, it is apparent that the relatively 
rapid readers had distinct advantage over the slow readers in the prepara~ 
tion of assignments or in any activity that involved reading. 
. The rate of a given reader varies with conditions—The experiments of 
Judd_and Buswell (203: 7-46) show that changes in the content or diffi- 
cilty of what is read and in the purpose of reading are accompanied by -- 
changes in rate. For example, one subject read fiction more than 150 
per cent as rapidly as he read easy verse and more than 200 per cent as 
rapidly as he read algebraic material. The influence of various other 
factors is shown in a later section of this chapter. It follows that the 
achievement of a reader can be described not in terms of a single rate of 
reading but rather in terms of different rates, which vary with the kind 
of material, its difficulty, the purpose of reading, and the conditions under 
which the reading is done.

55" SPEED OF SILENT READING 123 
Types of reading.—Since the rate at which one reads varies widely 
with conditions, it is desirable to distinguish important types. Brief 
reference will therefore be made to four types of reading to which investi- 
gators have referred frequently in studies of rate of reading. 
1. Normal reading.—In some of his early investigations Huey pointed 
out the fact that each reader fell “nto a reading pace that seemed most 
natural to him and would then read page after page in almost exactly the 
same time” (185: 175). In subsequent investigations Huey and others 
have used the term “normal reading” in referring to the reading of a 
child or adult at his most natural reading pace, 
2. Careful reading—Courtis (69) and others have shown that the 
speed of reading is noticeably reduced when the reader is asked to re- 
produce what he reads, to find answers to questions, or to select important 
points and supporting details. This type of reading has been characterized 
as careful reading. 
3- Rapid reading —Not infrequently a child or an adult reads a simple 
selection rapidly merely to enjoy the story, or he increases his rate of 
reading in order to complete a unit in a relatively short time. It is ap- 
parent that under such conditions he reads more rapidly than his normal 
rate. For example, Huey (185: 174-75) pointed out the fact that his 
subjects varied in rate of reading from 2.5 to 9.8 words a second in 
“normal reading” and from 3.5 to 13.5 words a second in “rapid reading.” 
Gilliland (118) and others have also used the term “rapid” i in referring 
to this type of reading. 
| 4. Skimming —Skilful readers acquire the habit of going through an 
article or book rapidly to find out what it contains or to select interesting 
‘items of information without actually reading each word, sentence, or 
paragraph. This type of reading has been called “skimming” and is 
characterized by the skilful selection of parts of a passage for reading and 
by the omission or skipping of other parts. Whipple and Curtis (413) 
found that the time per word, in hundredths of a second, for normal silent 
reading, maximal silent reading, and skimming is 26, 22, and 14, respec- 
tively. The correlation between natural rate in ordinary reading and 
preferred rate in skimming is .71. . 
Concluding statements—It is eviden® from the facts which have been 
presented that a given rate of reading, such as 350 words a minute, may 
represent the tate at which some pupils read normally or the rate at which 
other pupils read slowly or rapidly. It follows, therefore; that any effort 
to establish a standard rate of reading for all pupils fails to take into’ 
account two significant facts, namely, that rate of reading varies widely 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
124 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
among individuals and that rate varies for the same reader according to 
the kind and difficulty of the material, the purpose of reading, and the 
conditions under which the reading is done. 
RELATION BETWEEN SPEED AND COMPREHENSION 
Problem for consideration —It is frequently assumed that the rapid 
- reader does not understand what he reads as well as does the slow reader. 
If this were true, the development of speed in reading would contribute 
little or nothing to economy and efficiency in silent reading. It is the 
purpose of this section to summarize the results of studies that deal 
specifically with the relation between speed and comprehension in silent 
reading. The studies based on records of adult subjects will be summar- 
ized first. . 
Immediate reproductions when reading at normal rate.—As early as 
1897 Quantz found that his ten most rapid readers were, on the average, 
37 per cent superior to the ten slowest readers in the quality of their 
reproductions. “The superiority of the rapid reader is also shown by the 
fact that his memory of the substance of his reading is more exact than 
that of the slow reader” (308: 435). 
Immediate reproductions when reading rapidiy.—Records secured by 
Romanes (324) showed that one adult may read four times as rapidly 
as another. Furthermore, “there was no relationship between slowness 
of reading and power of assimilation; on the contrary, when all the efforts 
are directed to assimilating as much as possible in a given time, the rapid 
readers (as shown by their written notes) usually give a better account 
of the portion of the paragraph which has been compassed by the slow 
readers than the latter are able to give; and the most rapid reader whom 
I have found is also the best at assimilating.” 
Slightly delayed reproductions when reading at normal rate-—Abell (3) 
reported a study based on records from forty Wellesley students. The 
subjects were directed to read a story before going to class and to note 
the time required to read it. During the recitation period they wrote the 
story from memory. A study of their reproductions led to the conclusion 
that “comprehension may be independent of the absolute rate of reading,”? 
since of “all three classes of readers—fast, moderate, and slow—some 
comprehended well and others fairly or poorly.” 
Answers to questions when reading more rapidly or more slowly than 
normal.—In 1916 King (217) reported an experiment in which ninety- 
four subjects were arbitrarily “divided into fast‘and slow groups by 
telling each alternate student to read slowly and carefully and the others
-P-A-G-E-133
SPEED OF SILENT READING . 125 
to read rapidly but also carefully.” The students read for ten minutes 
and were then tested by a list of “mimeographed questions covering 
fourteen points for the slow group and four additional points for the fast 
group.” The group of fast readers made an average percentage score of 
44.5 and the group of slow readers an average percentage score of 53.3. 
An analysis of the records showed that the fast readers “covered more 
ground and remembered slightly more points than the slow, but not so 
many relatively.” It is evident that the average comprehension scores 
do not represent accurately the relative achievements of the two groups 
with regard to the total amount accomplished in ten minutes. Further- 
more, it is obvious that this study gives little information as to the relative 
merits of naturally slow or rapid reading. 
Answers to questions when reading at normal rate-—In a second experi- 
ment King (217) requested each of ninety-three subjects “to read as 
nearly as possible at his ordinary rate,” as determined by preliminary 
tests. The material assigned was an article from School and Society. All 
read until five or six of the most rapid readers had finished. This proce- 
dure necessarily penalized the most rapid readers so far as total accom- 
plishment was concerned. Sheets of questions covering the entire article 
were distributed, each student answering as many questions as he could. 
The answers were checked and percentage scores determined. The results 
showed that the most rapid 25 per cent made an average comprehension 
score of 50.2; the middle 50 per cent made an average score of 46.5; and 
the slowest 25 per cent made an average score of 48.0. The correlation 
(Pearson formula adapted to rank differences) was —.o7. King concluded 
from these findings that there is little difference in reading efficiency if 
the subjects read at their normal rates. “The fast readers have the 
advantage of covering more ground (nearly twice as much) and of having 
gained more points absolutely than the ‘slows,’ and the quality of their 
reading is very slightly better than that of the slowest group.” 
In two later experiments (218) results much more favorable to the 
slow readers were secured, the coefficients of correlation being ~.27 and 
~.47. King therefore concluded “that in this sort of test the rapid reader 
is considerably less efficient than the slow reader,” as measured by ability 
to answer accurately questions concerning what is read. Because of the 
wide differences in the results of King’s experiments, one is scarcely 
justified in accepting his final conclusion without additional evidence. 
The differences cited may have been due to a slight variation in method 
or possibly to the fact that the relation between speed and comprehension 
differs among groups of adults. Furthermore, the fact should be remem-
-P-A-G-E-134
126 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
_‘bered that King’s results are based on the percentage of specific questions 
answered correctly and that total accomplishment in a given unit of time 
was not considered. 
Comparison of resulis when comprehension is measured (1) by accuracy 
of interpretation and (2) by the number of ideas secured in a given unit of 
time.—Fifty college students were asked by Gilliland (118) to read a 
“number of paragraphs, each containing fifty words and ten distinct ideas. 
As soon as a paragraph was read, the students were asked to reproduce 
its content in writing. During the course of the experiment each student 
read passages rapidly, at his normal rate of reading, and slowly. The 
sum of the ideas reproduced after each reading gave the comprehension. 
score. The number of ideas secured per second was also determined. A 
comparison of the scores obtained by the two methods showed that, on 
the average, the readers secured more ideas from a given passage when 
reading slowly than when reading rapidly. When the results were inter- 
preted in terms of the number of ideas secured per second, the readers 
were more than 200 per cent as effective when reading rapidly as when 
reading slowly. Similar results were obtained in the case of elementary- 
school and high-school pupils. Reference has already been made to the 
fact that King found that his fast group read nearly twice as much 
material as the slow group in the same amount of time and answered a 
larger number of questions. These findings present a very important 
issue: Is accuracy in interpreting a given passage at a single reading or 
the total number of ideas gained during a given unit of time the more valid

and comprehension? 
Summary statements.—The studies with regard to the relation between 
speed and comprehension to which reference has been made justify the 
following tentative conclusions: (1) When adults read at their normal 
rate or rapidly, there is positive correlation between speed and compre- 
hension, although this relationship is by no means invariable. (2) The 
degree of correlation between speed and comprehension varies widely 
among groups of adults. (3) Mature readers, on the average, seem to 
grasp more of the ideas of a passage at a single reading if they read slowly 
than if they read at their normal rate. On the other hand, they secure q 
larger number of ideas per unit of time when reading rapidly. 
Results of studies with children.—In the case of children the results 
of studies of the relation between speed and comprehension may be con- 
sidered to advantage in connection with the following problems: (x) 
What general relation, if any, exists? (2) To what extent are there varia-
-P-A-G-E-135
SPEED OF SILENT READING 127 
tions in the degree of relationship? (3) What are the effects of types of 
material, difficulty of material, and purpose of reading on the relation 
between speed and comprehension? 
General nature of relation between speed and comprehension.—Hendricks 
(163) found that the rapid readers in thé three grades which he studied, 
namely, the first, fourth, and eighth, made higher average reproduction 
scores than did the slow readers. Waldo (401) studied the correlation 
between speed and comprehension for several grades and concluded that 
“no definite results can be stated, though it would seem that the rapid 
readers are usually strong in comprehension.” Oberholtzer (275) com- 
pared the rate and reproduction scores of 4,692 fifth- and sixth-grade 
pupils and concluded that the pupils who ranked highest in comprehension 
also made rate scores somewhat superior to those in the next lower 
comprehension group. Schmidt (329: 74-75) gave comprehension tests 
in the form of questions to all the elementary-school and high-school 
pupils who served as subjects in his laboratory study. The ten most 
rapid readers in each group were superior in comprehension to the ten 
slowest readers. Edith G. Germane, as reported by Hilliard (170: 22), 
found correlations ranging from .20 to .42 in Grades VI to VIII, inclusive. 
Comprehension was checked “by the number of correct answers that were 
given to questions covering the materials read.” She concluded from her 
study that “there is a positive correlation between speed and comprehen- 
sion,” that “some rapid readers are poor in comprehension while some of 
the slow readers are good in comprehension,” and that “the majority of 
students who. comprehend well are rapid readers and the majority who 
do not comprehend well are slow readers.” - . 
Judd (200: 153-56) reported the results of an elaborate study based 
on records from 1,831 pupils secured through the use of the Gray Silent 
Reading Tests, which measure comprehension by both answers to ques- 
tions and reproductions. The rate records were first arranged in order 
from the most rapid to the slowest and then divided into rapid, medium, 
and slow groups, made up of 25 per cent, 50 per cent, and 25 per cent, 
respectively, of the total records. The comprehension records were 
classified similarly. This resulted in nine possible classes to which an 
individual record could be assigned. When the individual records for - 
all grades from the second to the eighth, inclusive, had been classified, 
the percentage falling in each speed and quality group was determined. 
The results are presented in Figure 4 (200: 155). The general fact re- 
vealed is that “high rate and good quality are commonly related and that 
low rate and poor quality are commonly related.”

The studies to which reference has been made show that, in general, 
there is a positive relation between speed and comprehension among 
children. The relation is even more pronounced than in the case of adults. 
This relation is not invariable, however, as shown by the fact that many 
rapid readers interpret poorly and many slow readers interpret well.

Wide variations in degree of relationship.—The general facts presented 
will be supplemented by additional evidence secured through the use of 
the Gray Silent Reading Tests. This evidence shows that the degree of 
relationship varies widely. Table XX XIX (131: 136; 132: 175) gives 
the percentage of records in each of nine speed and quality groups for 
1,831 Cleveland pupils and for 2,940 St. Louis pupils when 33% per cent 
of the records are included in each speed group and in each quality group. 
According to this table, the degree of relationship varies considerably.
-P-A-G-E-137
SPEED OF SILENT READING 129 
Similar unpublished studies, based on the records of 1,270 Indianapolis 
pupils and 3,368 Grand Rapids pupils, reveal equally striking differ- 
ences. 
Furthermore, the tendency from grade to grade varies in schools and 
school systems. For example, the relation seems to increase from the 
second grade to the fourth grade in the case of the St. Louis records and 
then to decrease in the higher grades. In the eighth grade a negative 
correlation exists. In unpublished records for Grand Rapids there is 
little or no relation in the second and third grades, while there is pro- 
nounced positive correlation in some of the upper grades.

In connection with the Cleveland survey, calculations were made 
which show that the degree of relationship varies widely for different 
groups of pupils in the same grade. For example, the coefficients, as 
determined by the method of “Unlike-signed Pairs,” for the eighth grades 
of the Bolton, Brownell, Case Woodland, Chesterfield, and Clark schools 
were —.49, 1.00, .81, .22, and —.r11, respectively. 
The facts which have been presented show clearly that there are wide 
differences in the degree of correlation between speed and comprehension. . 
in different schools and school systems. These differences become doubly 
significant when the fact is recalled that the same tests were used in all 
the studies to which reference has been made. The discovery of the causes 
of these differences presents an important problem for investigation. One
-P-A-G-E-138
130 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
possible explanation may lie in the fact that teachers emphasize speed 
and comprehension differently in teaching silent reading. 
Effect of character of material, purpose of reading, and method of 
calculating index of comprehension.—Frequent reference has been made 
to the fact that changes in the kind of material read, in its difficulty, and 
in the purpose of reading are accompanied by changes in the reading 
attitudes and processes involved (203). Evidence is beginning to accumu- 
late which suggests that such changes may affect the degree of relation- 
ship between speed and comprehension. Scott (333) used four different se- 
lections in determining the correlation between speed and comprehension 
in an eighth-grade class. The average correlation for the four tests was “52 
per cent,” the range being from “42 per cent to 78 per cent.” “The latter 
correlation was found in a case where the reading material (from the 
Sketch-Book) was full of action, easy to grasp, and therefore easy to 
remember.” While this evidence is far from conclusive, it suggests that 
the greater fluency with which easy material is read may lead to a wider 
distribution of scores and a higher degree of correlation between speed and | 
comprehension. 
It is possible that a partial explanation for the differences discovered 
by Scott may be the kind of material used as contrasted with its difficulty. 
For example, Edith G. Germane, as quoted by Hilliard (170: 22), found 
that the correlations differed noticeably for the two selections which 
she used. In the sixth grade and in the eighth grade the correlation was 
higher in the case of one selection; in the seventh grade the correlation 
was higher in the case of the other selection. There are various possible 
explanations for this difference. The one suggested here for further 
investigation is that the kind of selection used and the pupils’ interest in 
the topic discussed and their familiarity with it affect the relation between 
speed and comprehension. 
The investigations of Judd and Buswell (203) showed clearly that 
different purposes of reading call forth quite different responses from 
members of a class, For example, some read at approximately the same 
tate when directed first to read carefully in order to answer questions and 
next to read rapidly merely to find out what is in an article. Most pupils 
read at different rates in the two situations, the difference varying with 
the individual. There is need of studies to determine the relation between 
speed and comprehension, as pupils are now taught, when reading for 
each of various important purposes. It is even more important to find 
the relation between speed and comprehension in the case of pupils who 
have been taught to read effectively for various purposes.
-P-A-G-E-139
SPEED OF SILENT READING 31 
Finally, there is need of studies to determine whether the index of 
comprehension used in correlation studies should vary with the purpose 
of reading. Gilliland (118) has shown that, on the average, comprehension 
varies but little in slow, normal, and fast reading when it is measured by 
the percentage of ideas secured from a single reading of a passage. On 
the other hand, his records show that comprehension is best in rapid 
reading when measured by the number of ideas secured per unit of time. 
It is fair to assume that a given index of comprehension, such as the 
percentage of ideas reproduced, is not equally valid in such widely differ- 
ent cases as reading carefully to master all the details of a passage and 
reading rapidly for five minutes to see how many facts relevant to a given 
problem can be secured in five minutes. 
Summary statements. —The studies to which reference has been made 
justify the following tentative conclusions: (x) There is positive correla- 
tion between speed and comprehension when children read carefully. As 
in the case of adults, there are numerous exceptions to the general rule. 
(2) The degree of correlation varies among school systems, schools, 
grades, and classes. (3) There is some evidence that the correlation 
between speed and comprehension may be affected by such factors as 
the kind and difficulty of passages, the purpose of reading, and the index 
of comprehension used in correlation studies. 
Pending the solution of the problems which have been suggested in 
this section, teachers and supervisors will do well to adopt the plan of 
training pupils to read only so rapidly as they can read effectively. 
Furthermore, specific training should be provided in reading for each of 
several purposes, Finally, the reading habits of individual pupils should 
be studied carefully and speed and comprehension emphasized in harmony 
with their needs. 
GROWTH PERIODS IN SPEED OF SILENT READING 
Resulis of current teaching—One method of determining growth 
periods in any phase of reading is to measure the achievements of pupils 
in reading as it is now taught. Such studies (128) have been made in the 
case of elementary-school pupils through the use of the Gray Silent 
Reading Tests, which measure the rate of careful reading. Figure 5 
(128: 183) shows the average rate of reading of 8,928 St. Louis pupils, 
1,831 Cleveland pupils, and 2,654 pupils in thirteen other cities. 
Figure 5 shows that, in general, the rate of reading increased rapidly 
during the first four grades and continued to increase steadily, but less 
rapidly, during the upper grades. In two of the three cases the increase
-P-A-G-E-140
132 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
from the sixth grade to the eighth grade is much less marked than the 
increase from the fourth grade to the sixth grade. These findings agree 
closely with the conclusions of other investigators, For example, Courtis 
(68) found that the curve for careful reading was “practically constant 
from the sixth grade on. This probably means that the rate and character 
of one’s serious reading are fixed in early school life.” 
Explanation of progress curve-—A partial explanation for the general 
character of the progress curve for rate of silent reading can readily be 
given. It was shown in chapter x that pupils develop rapidly during 
the early grades in speed, accuracy, and depth of interpretation, Further- 
more, the fact was emphasized in chapter ix that speed and accuracy of

Fic. 5.—Rate in silent reading for 8,928 St. Louis pupils (broken line), 1,831 
Cleveland pupils (dotted line), and 2,654 pupils of thirteen other‘cities (solid line). 
The dotted vertical lines indicate the use of different passages.   
recognition and a wide span of recognition also develop rapidly during 
the first four grades. As these habits become more mature, the eyes move 
forward with increasing regularity and rapidity along the lines. During 
the upper grades the rate of reading continues to increase somewhat, 
because the fundamental habits of recognition are improved and refined. 
Furthermore, the wide reading in which pupils engage and their greater 
ability to interpret enable them to grasp meanings more quickly. Conse- 
quently, the rate of reading increases in the case of most pupils. These 
facts make it clear that pupils should improve rapidly in rate of careful 
reading during the first five or six grades and steadily, but less rapidly, 
in the upper grades. 
Wide variations among schools in rate of progress —Investigations show 
that schools and school systems depart widely from the type of progress
-P-A-G-E-141
SPEED OF SILENT READING 133 
curve which has been described. For example, it was found that the cities 
of northern Illinois made far less progress in the early grades than did 
Cleveland, St. Louis, and other cities (129). By the end of the fourth 
gtade they were approximately two years behind the Cleveland record. 
It was not until the seventh grade that this deficiency was overcome. In 
the intervening grades the schools which had made rapid progress were 
enjoying the advantage of their early achievement. These facts indicate 
that there is distinct lack of uniformity in progress in rate of careful 
reading as a result of current instruction. A very fruitful field of investi- 
gation relates to the causes of the variations. 
Difference in growth curves for normal and careful reading —Courtis 
(68) made a comparative study of the rates of normal and careful reading 
from the fourth grade through the high school. The pupils were asked 
first to read at their natural rate to see how closely the story read agreed 
with one they had written. They were then directed to read carefully so 
that they could reproduce what they read. In harmony with natural 
expectation, the number of words read a minute was much larger in 
normal reading than in careful reading. In commenting on the results of 
this study, Courtis said, “It will be seen that the curve for normal reading 
rises to a high value and does not reach its maximum until the high-school 
years. The curve for careful reading, on the other hand, is practically 
constant from the sixth grade on.” 
These findings show clearly that progress in rate of reading follows 
different routes when pupils read for different purposes. Similar studies 
of progress when reading for various purposes should be made in other 
schools. When the results of current instruction have been investigated, 
studies should be undertaken to determine the most appropriate periods 
for emphasizing speed in each important type of reading. 
-When emphasis on speed of reading should begin.—Practice to increase 
the rate and span of recognition and to promote the rapid grasp of mean- 
ings is appropriate from the beginning of reading instruction, as shown 
in earlier chapters. Similarly, silent reading to promote habits of intelli- 
gent interpretation should be emphasized from the first. The critical 
period in the development of speed of reading comes when the rate of 
recognition equals or exceeds the rate of articulation. If a pupil contin- 
ues to articulate each word, his rate of reading will be limited to his 
rate of pronunciation. Emphasis on oral reading at this period tends to 
“keep all children down in their silent reading to the rate set by the 
oral reading emphasized in the schools” (204: 144). If, on the other 
hand, silent reading is emphasized, the reader develops the habit of
-P-A-G-E-142
134 . INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
moving his eyes forward along the lines as rapidly as he can grasp the 
meaning of what he reads. 
Investigations show that the rate of recognition usually exceeds the 
rate of articulation between the second grade and the fourth grade. For 
example, in one school tests of the rate of both oral and silent reading 
showed that in the case of second- and third-grade pupils the rate of 
silent reading was less rapid than the rate of oral reading (131: 148). 
In the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades the pupils read silently at a rate 
that was distinctly above the rate of oral reading. A study (276: 317) 
of approximately one thousand pupils showed that, on the average, third- 
grade pupils read more rapidly silently than orally. In still another 
investigation (200: 130) it was found that the median rate of silent 
reading exceeds the median rate of oral reading as early as the second

grade in some schools and not until the fourth grade in other schools. 
These findings show that the rate of recognition usually exceeds the rate 
of articulation between the second grade and the fourth grade. Teachers 
should make frequent studies of the progress of their pupils in order to 
determine when they begin to read more rapidly silently than orally. 
The effect of a change in emphasis from oral to silent reading is 
shown in Table XL (401: 262). This table shows the percentage of 
increase in rate of reading during a year in one school system as a result 
of directed practice in silent reading. The improvement from grade to 
grade is not shown accurately because of differences in the difficulty of 
the test passages. The data indicate, however, that the speed of reading 
was emphasized to advantage in this school system as early as the third 
grade. : 
Concluding statements.—The discussions have shown that speed of 
careful silent reading usually increases rapidly during the first five or six
-P-A-G-E-143
SPEED OF SILENT READING : 135 
grades and steadily, but less rapidly, during the upper grades. There is 
need of investigations to determine the causes of variations from this 
type of progress and to determine when speed of reading for various 
purposes can be emphasized most effectively. As reading is now taught, 
the rate of recognition usually exceeds the rate of articulation between the 
second grade and the fourth grade. When this point in the development 
of reading ability is reached, wide reading proves very effective in promot- 
ing the permanent establishment of habits of rapid silent reading. 
FACTORS AND CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SPEED OF READING 
Purpose of section.—It is the purpose of this section.to summarize 
the results of investigations which contribute information concerning 
important factors and conditions that affect speed of reading. 
Rate varies with the purpose of reading.—Judd and Buswell (203: 28) 
secured evidence which showed that reading merely to find out what is in 
a passage and reading for the purpose of answering questions were accom- 
panied by radically different habits on the part of most readers. In some 
cases the number of fixations was almost twice as great in reading to 
answer questions. Whipple and Curtis (413) found that when their 
subjects knew that they would be required to reproduce what they read, 
they proceeded more slowly than when reading without any such purpose 
in mind. Courtis (69), C. T. Gray (124), Hulten (187), and others have 
also secured evidence in support of the general fact that the rate of reading 
varies with the purpose. 
Increasing the amount of attention to the content of what is read decreases 
the rate of reading-—C. T. Gray (124) secured eye-movement records of 
subjects when reading prose for three purposes: “simply to understand,” 
to answer questions, and to reproduce. The number of fixations and the 
number of regressive movements were smallest in reading “simply to 
understand.” In some cases the rate of reading was higher when reading 
prose in preparation for reproduction than when reading to answer ques- 
tions. On inquiry, it was found that most of the students believed that 
teading to reproduce was more rapid because they “rushed through the 
selection to see what it was about.” 
Beauchamp (18) compared the rate and comprehension scores of 
directed-study and semi-directed-study classes. The directed-study class 
received specific training in making various types of analyses of the 
subject-matter, such as finding the central thought of a paragraph, 
answering thought questions, and determining the questions one should 
be able to answer about a topic. The records of the two classes showed
-P-A-G-E-144
136 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
that “training in various types of analyses of subject-matter increases the 
ability of the pupil to interpret and reproduce what he reads,” but “the 
gain in rate is greater if the pupil is not required to make an analysis of 
what he reads.” These facts make it clear that early lessons to increase 
the speed of reading should not require detailed analyses of subject-mat- 
ter. Ultimately, pupils must learn to read for each of various purposes as 
rapidly as they can read effectively. Consequently, a program of instruc- 
tion to increase speed of reading must sooner or later include types of 
reading that require a more or less thorough mastery of the content of 
what is read. 
Rate of reading varies with the kind of subject-matter and with the reader’s 
familiarity with it—Ruediger (326: 52) and Dearborn (77:'118) early 
concluded that rapid readers in one type of material are usually rapid in 
other types. Later experimenters, while supporting this view, point out 
numerous exceptions, which they attribute primarily to differences in 
interest and familiarity. For example, Pressey and Pressey (305) reached 
the following conclusion on the basis of tests including poetry, scientific 
material, and stories: “It appears, then, that ability in silent reading 
depends very largely on the nature of the passage read; a good reader in 
one type of subject-matter may very likely be a poor reader with other 
material.” Judd and Buswell (203: 7-26) found that different kinds of 
passages, such as fiction, geography, rhetoric, easy verse, French gram- 
mar, blank verse, and algebra, induced contrasting attitudes and dis- 
tinctly different rates of reading on the part of various individuals. “One 
reader swings into an easy, fluent stride and shows interest and compre- 
hension when he reads about algebraic formulas; another halts and 
stumbles and grows afraid.” In reading other types of material, the 
relative standing of two such readers may be reversed. 
Additional evidence of the effect of familiarity on rate of reading was 
secured by Ruediger, who found that the second reading of a given selec- 
tion was considerably faster than the first. “The three fastest readers read. 
on the average 1.9 words more per second in the second reading than in 
the first, while the three slowest read on the average only .53 of a word 
more” (326: 52). The explanation for the increase in the amount read 
is not far to seek. The readers became partly familiar with the content 
during the first reading. They were able, therefore, to anticipate and 
assimilate meanings more rapidly during the second reading, 
The studies to which reference has been made show clearly that rates 
of reading vary to a greater or less extent with the kind of subject-matter 
and with the reader’s familiarity with it. It is impossible at present to
-P-A-G-E-145
SPEED OF SILENT READING 137 
classify subject-matter with respect to the rate at which it will be read 
because of very wide individual differences in interest and familiarity. 
The only safe course for teachers to pursue is to test the rate and compre- 
hension of pupils when information concerning their achievement with 
specific kinds of passages is desired. Gray (131: 102), Judd and Buswell 
(203: 7-26), and others have secured clear evidence of the fact that easy 
passages are read more rapidly than are difficult passages. The difference 
is much more marked in the case of immature readers than in the case of 
adults. These findings are in harmony with natural expectation. The use 
of simple selections eliminates meaning difficulties and promotes rapid 
recognition, a wide span of recognition, and rhythmical movements of 
the eye along the lines. 
Different views have been expressed concerning the influence of the 
length of words on the rate of reading. Early investigators maintained 
that the rate of reading varies with the character of the words used. Thus, 
a preponderance of monosyllabic words was thought to decrease the rate 
on account of the relatively greater meaning conveyed by the short words. 
In checking the results of Messmer’s experiment, Dearborn (77) concluded 
that “it is not the short words as such but the words which cannot be 
easily grouped with others which necessitate separate fixation.” The 
characteristics of words and passages that retard the speed of reading 
offer wide opportunity for productive research. 
Rate of reading increases as the amount of lip-movement decreases — 
Abell (3), Huey (185), Quantz (308), and others early concluded from 
their observations and experiments that the presence of lip-movements 
retards the rate of reading. For example, from a study of adult subjects 
Quantz concluded that lip-movement in any degree retards the rate of 
reading and that the stronger the tendency, the slower the rate. His 
records showed that “the ten slowest readers almost double the amount 
of lip-movement that the ten most rapid do.” Furthermore, “not one of 
those whose reading is widest is a lip-mover to any extent which can be 
observed.” Huey agrees with the general conclusions cited but points 
out certain exceptions. In a study of elementary-school pupils Hendricks 
(163) found that in the first grade there was no appreciable difference 
between the rates at which lip-movers and non-lip-movers read; in the 
fourth grade lip-movers read more slowly than did non-lip-movers; and 
in the eighth grade lip-movers read decidedly more slowly than did non- 
lip-movers. Through practice in reading without vocalization, C. T. 
Gray (124: 162) secured distinct increases in rate of reading on the part 
of two subjects, one from the fourth grade and one from the sixth grade.
-P-A-G-E-146
138 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
These findings make it clear that lip-movements are undesirable and 
should be eliminated. 
Extensive reading promotes habits of rapid reading——Hunt (188) 
divided the pupils of a fourth-grade class into two groups, namely, the 
extensive readers who read a book or more a week in addition to the as~ 
signed texts and the non-readers who read but little and with no regularity. 
When these pupils were given the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading 
Test, it was found that the extensive readers made a rate score of 76 and 
a, comprehension score of 9.5, while the non-readers made scores of 54 and 
5-4 in rate and comprehension, respectively. 
In order to secure additional information, Hunt classified the pupils 
of three seventh-grade classes into extensive readers and non-readers. 
They were given the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test and the 
Otis Group Intelligence Test. The median scores of the extensive readers 
and the non-readers on the latter test were 91 and go, respectively. It is 
evident, therefore, that any differences in reading scores that may be 
found should not be attributed to differences in the intelligence of the 
two groups. The average scores of the extensive readers were 133 in rate 
of reading and 23.5 in comprehension; the average scores of the non- 
readers were 107 in rate and 17.1 in comprehension. These scores supply 
clear evidence that extensive reading is an important factor in increasing 
the speed of reading. 
Additional factors that influence speed of reading—In a summary of 
all the factors which he found to contribute to rapid reading, Quantz 
listed the following, in the order of importance: “visual perception, 
practice as determined by amount of reading from childhood on,-bower 
of concentration, mental alertness estimated by rapidity of original 
composition, scholarly ability as decided by college records” (308: 50). 
In a summary of the investigations relating to speed of reading, O’Brien 
(280: 36-81) concluded that the following factors influence the rate of 
reading: practice in rapid silent reading, vocalization in silent reading, 
training in perception, the character of the subject-matter, habits of eye- 
movement, purpose of reading, concentration of attention, ability to 
grasp meaning, reaction time, and the type of imagery employed by 
the reader. Many of these factors have already been mentioned. The 
effect of practice on speed of reading will be discussed in a later section. 
The evidence with regard to the influence of the type of imagery is not 
altogether conclusive. 
Concluding staiements—-The discussions in this section show that 
speed of reading varies with the purpose of the reading, with the amount
-P-A-G-E-147
SPEED OF SILENT READING 139 
of thought given to the content of what is read, with the kind of subject- 
matter read and the reader’s familiarity with it, with the difficulty of the 
passage, with the amount of lip-movement that accompanies reading, 
and with the amount of reading that is done. The following additional 
factors have been suggested by different experimenters: power of concen- 
tration, mental alertness, training in perception, habits of eye-movement, 
ability to grasp meaning, scholarly ability, reaction time, the type of 
imagery employed, and practice. There is need of additional research in 
this field to determine all the factors that influence speed of reading and 
the conditions under which each functions most effectively.

pupils—-The experiments which have been reported indicate ‘that the 
following methods are effective in incrégsing the speed of reading: speed 
drills; speed drills supplemented by short-exposure exercises; training in 
rapid reading, in decreasing vocalization, and in increasing the span 
of recognition; rapid reading with oral recitations and paragraph read- 
ing to answer questions; and increasing the amount of reading.’ The 
details of these methods, their effect on comprehension as well as on speed, 
the permanency of improvemént, the effect of training on pupils of differ- 
ent intelligence levels, and the need of training to read for specific pur- 
poses will be considered in the discussions that folldw. 
Effect of speed drills.—Peters (293) arranged speed drills for groups 
of pupils in Grades III fo VI, inclusive, and compared the results with 
the progress of non-drill sections of approximately equal size and ability. 
The speed drills occupied from five to ten minutes of the reading period. 
Very simple selections were assigned. “The group as a whole was told 
explicitly where to begin and how far to read, and were then all set to 
. silent reading at the same time with the exhortation to see who could get 
it read first. After all, or nearly all, had finished, someone was asked to 
tell the substance of what he had-read. If, in this reproduction, he omitted 
anything, he was questioned on it as a guarantee against skimming.” 
Both groups were tested November 6, January 20, April 20, and June 2. 
A comparison of the results showed in the case of the drill group a gain 
of 18.7 per cent in speed and a slight loss in comprehension. : 
Potter (300) carried on a similar experiment in Grades IV, V, and VI. 
The period of training lasted for about a month arid took the place of the 
regular work in reading. The training exercises included timed readings

followed by reproductions and answers to questions. An effort was made 
to guard against the development of a single, narrow type of reading 
ability. The results of the training, as measured by different forms of the 
Burgess Scale for Measuring Ability’ in Silent Reading, were twofold: a 
great increase in the speed of reading as measured by the test and, with 
few exceptions, an increase in comprehension. : 
‘These experiments justify the conclusion that speed drills are effective 
in increasing the rate of reading and that the effect of such training on 
comprehension depends on the amount of emphasis placed on it. Addi- 
tional studies are needed to determine the types of training that will result 
in maximum progress in both speed and comprehension. 
Effect of short-exposure exercises combined with speed drills —C. T. Gray 
(124: 149-57) conducted a controlled experiment with a good reader and a 
poor reader in the fourth grade. Fifteen or twenty minutes a day for twenty 
days was devoted to each of two types of training: first, short-exposure 
work on sense material, non-sense syllables, digits, and groups of zeros; . 
second, training in Aapid reading. In the second type of training the pupils 
were to read rapidly, even at the sacrifice of comprehension, if necessary. 
Oral or written reproduction tests were given following each reading. The 
tests at the end of the training period showed a marked increase in speed 
of reading and some loss in comprehension in the case of both pupils. 
The decrease in rate during the three months following the practice period. 
did not carry the readers back to the points at which they started before 
practice. The loss in comprehension may be explained in terms of the 
emphasis placed on speed. This experiment verifies, in a sense, the con- 
clusion reached in the preceding paragraph, namely, that the effect of 
speed drills on comprehension depends on the amount of emphasis 
placed on the latter during the training period. 
Effect of training in rapid reading, training to decrease vocalization, and 
training to increase the span of recognition —Three studies have been 
reported which used essentially the same methods of training. The 
experiment by O’Brien (280) was the first in the series and developed 
methods which were used in the later studies, The experiment by Coil 
(6s) took account of the permanency of the improvement and the effects 
of the training as measured by different tests. The experiment by Merrick 
(257) showed the effect of training on pupils of different intelligence levels. 
O’Brien (280) carried on an elaborate training experiment in forty 
classes of twenty schools in nine cities of Illinois. The training continued 
for thirty-nine school days. Each of forty classes was divided into an 
experimental group and a control group, “approximately equal in rate
-P-A-G-E-149
SPEED OF SILENT READING I4r 
of reading,” as determined by the Courtis Silent Reading Test. Three 
types of training were provided. The first was training in rapid silent 
reading. The pupils were told of the advantages of reading rapidly, and 
an effort was made to enlist their whole-hearted co-operation in securing 
improvement. The method consisted of alternate reading and reproduc- 
tion, each reading lasting for two, three, or four minutes. The amount 
read was quickly determined. An oral or written reproduction followed, 
supplemented at times by answers to questions. At the end of the period 
each pupil entered on a chart his average rate for the day. The second 
type of training included efforts to decrease vocalization. The third type 
consisted of short-exposure exercises supplemented with practice in 
rapid reading. Detailed descriptions of these types of training are given 
by O’Brien in his report of the study. 
A comparison of the test records of the experimental and control 
groups at the end of the training period justified the following conclusions: 
(t) The rate of reading may be greatly increased by the methods de- 
scribed. The improvement is much greater during the first month than 
during the second month. (2) “Marked improvement in speed of reading 
may be effected without any improvement of the comprehension.” To 
secure improvement in the latter, training must be introduced which places 
specific emphasis on the interpretation of what is read. Unfortunately, 
O’Brien used only one test in determining the effect of the training; 
furthermore, the test was not repeated several weeks after the training 
period to determine the permanence'of the improvement. Both of these 
steps were included in the experiment which is. reported next. 
Coil (65) gave essentially the same types of training to alternate grades 
in an elementary school under his supervision. The chief differences be- 
tween his procedure and that of O’Brien are suggested by the follow- 
ing statements: (1) The pupils of the fourth, sixth, and eighth grades 
served as experimental groups, and the pupils of the third, fifth, and 
seventh grades served as control groups. (2) Three different reading tests 
were used in determining the results of the training, namely, the Courtis, 
Burgess, and Thorndike-McCall tests. (3) Each test was given at the 
beginning and at the end of the training period and six weeks after the 
training was discontinued to determine the permanence of any increase 
that may have resulted from the training. 
A comparison of the various records revealed three important facts. 
First, the training was very effective in increasing the speed of reading in 
Grades IV, VI, and VIII, as measured by the Courtis test. The increase 
in speed was not altogether permanent, there being a loss of about 20
-P-A-G-E-150
142 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
per cent during the six weeks following the training. The increase in the 
number of questions answered was very marked. “The gain was not only 
permanent but continues after the training ceases.” There was a slight 
loss in the index of comprehension, which was more than regained during 
the six weeks following the training period. In the second place, the 
training was very effective in improving the type of reading ability that 
is measured by the Thorndike-McCall test. Most pupils continued to 
improve after the training ceased. Finally, as measured by the Burgess 
test, the training was effective in Grades IV and VI but not in Grade 
VIII. The gain was permanent and increased somewhat following the 
training period. 
Merrick (257) gave training similar to that outlined by O’Brien to all 
pupils of a given school in Grades IV to VIII, inclusive, except those who 
formed the control groups. Experimental and control groups were selected 
on the basis of general intelligence as measured by the Illinois Examina- 
tion and on the basis of reading achievement as measured by the Monroe 
_ Standardized Silent Reading Test. The training continued from February 
3 to April 7. Tests were given at the beginning of the training period, four 
and one-half weeks later, at the end of the training period, and two months 
after the training was discontinued in order to test the permanence of 
improvement. The tests used were four forms of the Thorndike-McCall 
Reading Scale and four informal tests of rate of reading, the relative 
difficulty of which was known. The results of the tests revealed the 
following facts: (1) The speed of reading increased very markedly, and 
the comprehension scores increased slightly. (2) The pupils of high 
intelligence gained more rapidly in rate of reading than did the pupils of 
low intelligence. (3) In the case of pupils below normal in intelligence 
there was evidence of “grave danger of prolonging the period of training 
in rapid reading and overemphasizing speed, to the detriment of compre- 
hension.” (4) After two months there was a loss of 13 per cent in rate 
and of 2.4 points in comprehension. The pupils of high average intelli- 
gence in the eighth-grade section proved an exception, for they showed an 
additional gain of 3 per cent in rate. 
The experiments of O’Brien, Coil, and Merrick justify at least three 
general conclusions. First, speed of reading as measured by the Courtis 
test may be materially increased with little or no decrease in comprehen- 
sion, The greater part of the improvement occurs during the first month 
of training. The pupils of high intelligence gain most rapidly. In the case 
of pupils below normal in intelligence there seems to be danger of prolong- 
ing the training too long, thus overemphasizing speed to the detriment
-P-A-G-E-151
SPEED OF SILENT READING 143 
of comprehension. There is need of additional studies to determine the 
most desirable length of training for pupils of various levels of intelligence 
and to determine the types of training that are most effective in each case. 
Second, the increase in speed of reading is by no means permanent. An 
eighth-grade class of superior intelligence’ proved an exception. There is 
need of studies to determine a program of distributed practice which will 
insure permanence of improvement. Finally, the fact that the results of 
training differed somewhat with the type of test used in checking results 
suggests the need of experiments to determine the most effective types of 
instruction in training pupils to read rapidly for each of various purposes. 
Relative merits of rapid reading with oral recitations and the paragraph- 
question method.—Gates and Van Alstyne (108) compared the gain in 
speed and comprehension in Grades III to VI, inclusive, resulting from 
the two types of training described on pages 92-93. One class in each 
grade was “given specific training in one form of reading; another, in a 
second form of reading; and a third, the control group, was given no 
special training during the practice period.” The training continued for 
from eleven to seventeen days, varying with the grade. The results were 
checked through the use of five reading tests. The results for three tests 
appear in Table XLI (108: 112-13). 
Table XLI shows that in all but one case the training groups improved 
more than did the control groups in both rate and comprehension. The 
table also reveals the general superiority of rapid reading with oral 
recitations in increasing the rate of reading and the inferiority of this 
method. in increasing comprehension. “The most likely explanation, we 
believe, is that speed was given rather more, and accuracy in compre- 
hension rather less, emphasis in the oral-recitation groups.” This experi- 
ment provides another striking example of the fact that improvement in 
speed and comprehension depends primarily on the emphasis placed on 
each. 
As a part of their investigation, Gates and Van Alstyne analyzed the 
records in order to determine the extent to which training in one type of 
reading increased ability in other types. It was found that the “transfer 
was small but genuine.” Such transfer is so small “that it cannot be 
depended upon to develop desired abilities. They must be developed 
specifically.” As the authors point out, this problem requires further 
study. The evidence is sufficiently clear, however, to justify the conclu- 
sion reached in previous sections of this report to the effect that a program 
of instruction to increase speed of reading must include training in reading 
for various purposes.

Effect of increasing the amount of reading that is done-—The steps taken 
by Ford (gs) to increase the amount of reading done by the pupils in the 
Calcasieu Parish schools were described on page 105. It will suffice here 
merely to refer to the fact that the increase in the amount read was 
accompanied by a radical increase in both rate and comprehension as 
measured by the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test. Although 
this test does not measure rate of reading directly, the increase in the 
rate score was so pronounced that we are justified in concluding that the

rate of reading was materially increased. The additional fact should be 
pointed out that the improvement was due both to the increase in the 
amount read and to the general campaign to improve reading instruction. 
Controlled experiments are needed to determine more accurately the 
extent to which the amount read specifically influences speed of reading. 
Types of practice to increase speed of reading among high-school pupils. 
—-Reference was made on pages 141-42 to the effort of Coil (65) to in- 
crease the speed of reading among elementary-school pupils. The results 
for the eighth grade showed greater gain in rate and less gain in compre- 
hension for the experimental group than for the control group. Because
-P-A-G-E-153

of the unsatisfactory record in comprehension, the experiment was con- 
tinued the following year when the pupils were in the first year of the 
high school. The specific: aim of this work was to determine whether 
reading with definite purposes is more effective in increasing speed of 
reading than are the speed drills used in the elementary school. Accord- 
ingly, the pupils were asked to read during four twenty-minute periods 
each week, making use of one or more of the following purposes, according 
to the character of the subject-matter: finding the central thought, 
finding answers to questions, finding facts relating to a definite problem, 
finding a series of closely related points to be arranged in their proper 
relationships, finding the author’s aim or purpose, finding the arguments 
for and against a certain point, and skimming over material in order to 
locate a certain topic. Speed drills were given during one twenty-minute 
period each week, as in the experiment of the previous year. The pupils 
were encouraged to carry over the reading habits thus established to their 
outside reading. 
The training continued for six weeks. As measured by thé Burgess 
test, the results were very gratifying. According to the Courtis test, the 
results were satisfactory for both rate of reading and the number of 
questions answered. The increase as measured by the Burgess test was 
much more permanent than the increase as measured by the Courtis test. 
As measured by the Courtis test and the Thorndike-McCall test, compre- 
hension was very little affected by the training. Coil’s general conclusion 
was that reading with definite aims is a better method of increasing speed 
in the upper grades than is the use of speed drills. The fact that rate 
increased more than comprehension indicates that the type of training 
provided emphasized speed of reading. Unfortunately, no control group 
was used in this experiment; only one class of twenty-five pupils received 
training. 
Coil’s general conclusion is not fully supported by the results of 
Beauchamp’s experiments (18). Special training was given to one class 
in finding the central thought of a paragraph, in determining the questions 
one should be able to answer about the content of a passage, and in read- 
ing an entire block of material to determine its general plan. The results 
of the experiment showed that training in making the various types of 
analyses was far more productive in increasing comprehension than were 
the methods employed by the control directed class. With regard to speed 
of reading, the results showed that there was an increase in both classes 
but “that the increase was greater in the class which was not required 
to analyze the subject-matter studied.”
-P-A-G-E-154
146 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
The experiments of Coil and Beauchamp indicate clearly that the 
effect of training depends to a large extent on what is emphasized. In 
order to secure satisfactory improvement in both speed and comprehension, 
there is need of additional studies to determine the amount of emphasis to 
be placed on speed when reading for specific purposes. There is also need of 
additional experiments to determine whether the types of training which 
prove most effective differ for pupils at various levels of advancement. 
Types of practice to increase speed of reading among college students and 
adults.—There is abundant evidence that the speed of adult reading may 
be increased. For example, Huey reports that “I have considerably in- 
creased my own speed in reading by-waking up to the fact that my rate 
was unnecessarily slow and then persistently reading as fast as possible 
with well-concentrated attention, taking care to stop short of fatigue 
until the new pace was somewhat established” (185: 179). Several experi- 
ments with college students have been reported. 
Effect of “pacing” eye-movements.—Breitwieser (39) reports the use 
of an apparatus that exposed the lines of a printed page at varying rates. 
The rate of exposure was increased in successive experiments “so'1s to 
make it necessary to increase the reading rate if the subject ced 
to gather all the thought.” In sixty cases “the average gain in reading 
time was 33% per cent. Some slow readers gained as high as 53 per cent. 
. Silent-reading tests further demonstrated that this faster reading 
rate was carried over into reading material not exposed in the machine.’’ 
No statement is made concerning the effect on comprehension. 
Effect of knowledge of results of practice-—In an experiment by Harrel- 
son (157) two criteria were kept in mind: “The reading should call out 
individual activity and the results themselves act as a stimulus to further 
activity on the part of the students; and, second, the records should be 
objective.” Training consisted in having twenty-three students engage 
in ten readings each day. Each reading lasted for thirty seconds and was 
followed immediately by a written reproduction. The students were kept 
informed with regard to their progress. The training continued for ten 
days, five of which were devoted to silent reading and five to oral reading. 
The results showed an increase from the first day to the fifth from 97.7 
to 135.0 words in oral reading and from 109.6 to 151.4 words in silent 
reading. There was also an increase in comprehension by both methods 
as measured by the total number of ideas reproduced. When the ratio 
of the number of ideas reproduced to the number of ideas read was 
determined, it was found that the ratio remained practically constant i in 
both oral and silent reading. :

Effect of developing motives for improvement, securing favorable condid*~ 
tions for practice, studying the factors of success, diagnosing and removing 
hindrances, and securing persistence in practice —The experiment of Stone 
(359) in improving the ability of college students in comprehension was 
described on pages 111-12. The effect of the training on speed of reading 
was determined through the use of standardized tests, by practice 
records, and according to the “students’ belief as.to their improvement 
in reading outside the courses in which the practic’ was given.” The 
results in each case were satisfactory. As measured by the Monroe 
Standardized’ Silent Reading Test and the Stone Extensions of that test, 
the increase in rate of the practice group was 84 per cent. Furthermore, 
the practice group made nearly twice as much gain in comprehension as 
did the partial-practice group and nearly four times as much gain as did 
the check group. The results supply clear evidence of the value of the 
training. Unfortunately, various methods were employed, and it is im- 
possible to draw conclusions concerning the procedures which were most 
effective in increasing the speed of reading. Furthermore, the measures 
of ‘te of reading that were used are only general indexes of speed of 
Te. og. 
Effect of controlled practice, self-analysis with regard to study habits, 
and study of the psychology of reading —The experiment of Stone and 
Colvin (360) in improving the study habits of forty-five students 
was described on page 112. The results for speed of reading, as measured 
by the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test and the Stone Exten- 
sions of it, showed that students wha were trained “gained nearly three 
times as much in speed and fully three and a half times as much in com- 
prehension as the check class.” This experiment, however, is open to the 
same criticisms as were offered concerning Stone’s experiment: 
Concluding statements —The studies to which reference has been made 
justify the following conclusions: (1) Speed of reading may be increased 
in the case of elementary-school pupils, high-school pupils, and college © 
students. (2) This increase may be effected without impairing compre- 
hension. (3) The effect of speed drills on comprehension varies with the 
emphasis which is placed on both speed and comprehension in the training 
exercises. Three problems which are in urgent need of additional study 
are the relative value of different specific methods and combinations of 
methods in increasing speed, the types of training that are most appropri- 
ate for different types of readers at different levels of advancement, and 
the most effective distribution of practice to secure permanence of im- 
provement. f a

CHAPTER XII 
ORAL READING 
Problems for discussion. —It is the purpose of this chapter to sum- 
marize the results of experiments and investigations-relating to three 
problems: (1) growth in oral-reading accomplishment, (2) the factors or 
conditions that favor its progress, and (3) the quality of oral reading. 
GROWTH IN ORKL-READING ACCOMPLISHMENT 
Progress in speed and accuracy of oral reading.—Numerous measure- 
ments have been made of progress in speed and accuracy of oral reading 
through the use of the Gray Oral Reading Test. The scores for 2,193 
pupils of Cleveland, for 4,066 pupils of Grand Rapids, for 10,526 pupils of 
St. Louis, and for 1,983 pupils of eleven cities of northern Illinois are 
shown graphically in Figure 6 (130: 23). The general fact revealed by this 
figure is that accomplishment in speed and accuracy of oral reading in- ~ 
creases rapidly in the, lower grades and continues to improve steadily, 
but less rapidly, in the middle and higher grades. The additional fact 
is clear that school systems differ considerably with regard to the level : 
of accomplishment attained in specific grades. An analysis of the average 
progress from grade to grade shows that the increase between the first 
grade and the second grade is approximately 20 units; between the second 
grade and the third grade, 7 units; between the third grade and the fourth 
grade, 6 units; and between each two of the succeeding grades, 5 units. 
These facts make it clear that the first three grades represent a period 
during which pupils develop most rapidly in speed and accuracy of oral 
reading. 
Explanation of progress curve—The general facts shown in Figure 6 
are in harmony with natural expectation. The pupils of the lower grades 
use a great deal of time in learning to read. Each lesson affords numerous 
opportunities to associate printed words with their meaning and pronunci- . 
ation. Consequently, there is rapid progress in the development of speed 
and accuracy of recognition, a wide span of recognition, rhythmical 
progress of perceptions along the lines, and accurate return sweeps from 
the end of one line to the beginning of the next (see chapter ix). There 
is also rapid increase during this period in the eye-voice span, which 
is the distance that, the eye precedes the voice in oral reading. In sum-

150 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
marizing his data, Buswell (gx: 41) pointed out the fact that the eye- 
voice span increases rapidly during the first four grades for the good 
reader and reaches a maximum during those grades. In the case of the 
poor reader, however, “the span develops gradually throughout the whole 
school period.” 
By the time pupils reach the fourth grade they are able to read 
simple informational selections with fair speed and accuracy. An in- 
creasingly large part of their attention is directed, therefore, to the acqui- 
sition of meaning. Consequently, improvement in speed and accuracy of 
oral reading i is not so rapid as in the lower grades. On the other hand, 
there is steady progress throughout the middle and upper grades, due 
to several facts: namely, new words appear in the reading material from 
day to day; fundamental habits which were partly formed in the earlier 
grades are refined and develop to maturity; the speed of vocalization 
increases somewhat; and oral-reading habits are improved systematically 
in many cases through conscious effort on the part of pupils and teacher. 
FACTORS AND CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT PROGRESS 
Progress affected by conditions—A study of the conditions which 
prevail in many schools shows clearly that progress in speed and accuracy 
of oral reading is directly related {o the presence or absence of various 
factors or conditions. Some of the unfavorable conditions can be readily 
eliminated or modified; others present problems which challenge the best 
thought and effort of teachers, administrators, and scientists. In the 
discussion that follows reference will be made only to those conditions 
concerning which there is some evidence. 
Intelligence —In a study involving 1,050 pupils in the first and second 
grades, Oglesby (282) classified the pupils into three groups on the basis 
of their intelligence scores. The highest 20 per cent were placed in the X 
group, the lowest’ 20 per cent in the Z group, and the remaining 60 per 
cent in the Y group. When oral-reading tests were given, it was found 
that the X pupils usually, although not invariably, read the most rapidly, 
made the smallest number of errors, and attempted the hardest para- 
graphs. There was a surprisingly large amount of overlapping, however, 
in the accomplishments of the three groups, which indicates clearly that 
there are factors other than intelligence that are important in determining 
progress in beginning reading. Some of these factors are “differences in 
~ health, in attendance, in the-nationality of the pupils, in the attitude of 
the pupil toward school work, in the ability of the teacher, and in the 
quality of the materials and methods of. instruction. No matter how 
.
-P-A-G-E-159
ORAL READING ISI 
carefully children are classified according to intelligence, these other 
factors will continue to produce large variations in the achievement of 
any one group” (282: 61). . 
Nationality—In the surveys of reading made in Cleveland and St. 
Louis the accomplishments of pupils of different nationalities were studied. 
The language spoken in the home was made the basis of classification. 
In harmony with the results secured in Cleveland, it was found that in the 
primary grades English- and German-speaking children represent average 
achievement. Jewish children rank above the average and Italian pupils rank 
distinctly below the average. With the exception of the German and Jewish 
children, practically all foreign-speaking children are seriously retarded by the 
language handicap [132: 140]. 
Additional evidence of wide variation in accomplishment between 
children of different nationalities was secured by Zornow (436: 100-101) 
in a study made in Rochester, New York: 
A second significant fact is that children belonging to the same 
nationality group differ widely in accomplishment. This indicates that 
factors or conditions other than nationality operate among foreign-speak- 
ing children to modify their progress. For example, in a study by Oglesby 
it was found that the scores of foreign children in the ¥ and Z groups were 
much lower than the scores of pupils of like intelligence coming from 
English-speaking homes. When the scores of the pupils in the X groups 
were compared, however, it was found that the “brightest pupils in 
foreign schools do just about as well as the pupils who come from English- 
speaking homes” (282: 58-59). It is evident, therefore, that foreign- 
speaking children of superior intelligence are able to overcome their 
language handicap more easily than are those of inferior learning capacity. 
Economic conditions.—The relation of economic conditions to achieve- 
ment in oral reading was considered in the Indianapolis survey of reading 
(136: 424~25). After the oral-reading tests had been given, the schools 
were classified into three groups on the basis of the economic conditions 
of the communities in which they were located. For example, four schools 
were considered-“‘very good” from an economic point of view. The fact 
that one of these schools did not rank as high in oral-reading achievement 
as the other three indicates that there are factors other than economic 
conditions which contribute to success in reading. Four schools were 
considered “fair” with respect to economic conditions, The fact that 
one of these schools ranked relatively high in oral reading indicates 
“that it is possible for some factor, such as skilful instruction, to overcome

Chronological age—The pupils of each grade tested in the St. Louis 
survey (132: 137-39) were classified according to age, and the average 
oral-reading score of each group was determined. The data showed 
“that the average scores for the age groups in the first grade decrease as 
one passes from the seven-year-old group to the eight- and nine-year-old 
groups.” Similar statements may be made concerning the accomplish- 
ments of pupils in the more advanced grades. Since learning capacity 
is an important factor in determining progress in reading, it is possible 
that the influence of age as shown in this study is but another measure 
of the effect of intelligence on progress in oral reading. Unfortunately, 
mental tests were not given in this investigation. It is doubtless true, 
however, that the brighter children quickly mastered the fundamental 
habits of oral reading. The advantage thus gained at the outset was easily 
maintained throughout the grades. 
Sex.—It was found in the Cleveland survey (200: 143) that through- 
out the grades the girls averaged higher in oral-reading accomplishment 
than did the boys. In the case of 5,118 boys and girls in the St. Louis 
survey (132: 139) it was found-that the girls averaged higher than the 
boys in all grades above the first. “The amount of superiority is equal to 
the progress made in from one-fourth to one-third of a year. Although 
this difference is not large, it emphasizes the fact that boys require a 
relatively larger amount of instruction in oral reading than do girls in 
order to. secure equal amounts of achievement.” The additional fact 
should be emphasized that, when the accomplishments of individual 
pupils are studied, numerous exceptions are found to the general state- 
ment which has been made. Many girls need more training in oral reading 
than do some boys, and many boys need less training than is required. 
by some girls., .O 
Methods of teaching—Evidence has accumulated which shows that 
progress in oral reading may be attributed, in part at least, to the methods 
of teaching employed. For example, a comparison of the results of the 
_ oral-reading tests given in the Cleveland and St. Louis surveys shows 
that St. Louis ranked higher than did Cleveland in every grade (128). 
The results of the silent-reading tests showed that St. Louis also ranked 
higher in comprehension. Classroom observations revealed the fact that 
Cleveland emphasized the inechanics of reading an that St. Louis gave 
attention primarily to the éontent of what wa: wea) De inference that 
may be drawn from these facts is that emphasis on the meaning of what 
is read is essential to rapid progress in oral reading. 
L
-P-A-G-E-161
ORAL READING 153, 
Amount of reading-—In the survey of the’St. Louis schools the fact 
was observed that “differences in achievement were frequently correlated 
with differences in the quantity and quality of the supplementary reading 
material which was supplied to the pupils. In many schools pupils in 
the second and third grades read at least one book a week outside of 
school hours. In other schools no such provision can be made, and the 
lower achievement on the part of these pupils was clearly displayed 
during the reading period and in the tests” (132: 147-48). ‘There were 
doubtless conditions other than the wide use of supplementary material 
that affected progress in certain schools. Investigations are needed to 
determine the specific effect of the amount Tead silently on progress in 
oral reading. 
Summary statements——The studies which have been reviewed show 
clearly that the following factors and conditions affect progress in oral 
reading either directly or indirectly: intelligence, nationality, economic 
conditions, chronological age, sex, methodsof f teaching, and the amount 
read. Other factors which have been Suggested are differences in health, 
attendance, the attitude of. the pupils toward reading, the ability of the 
teacher, the quality of the materials used, detailed techniques of teaching, 
the amount of time devoted to reading, the amount and quality of super- 
vision, the provisions for individual differences, the out-of-school experi- 
ences which pupils encounter, and the amount and character of kinder- 
garten training which the pupils have had. There is need of studies of 
these and other factors to determine the extent to which each affects 
progress in oral reading. Studies should also be made of various combina- 
tions of factors to determine which are most favorable to rapid progress. 
QUALITY OF ORAL READING 
Problems for consideration.—The discussion thus far has dealt with 
growth in speed and accuracy of oral reading and with the factors or condi- 
tions that favor progress. The remainder of the chapter relates to those 
phases of oral reading which refer more directly to the quality of oral 
interpretation. Volumes have been written concerning the various ele- 
ments of expression that are involved, ‘Reference is made here only to 
those phases of oral interpretation concerning which scientific studies 
have been made. These include (r) rhythm of expression, (2) the creation 
of atmosphere by the reader, (3) the effect of changes in auditory stimula- 
tions, namely, pitch, time, pause, and intensity, (4) the relation of 
breathing to good oral reading.
-P-A-G-E-162
154 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Rhythm in oral reading-—It has been pointed out by Lipsky that “the 
effect of rhythm in language is to lock the parts together into a unity and 
thus to facilitate comprehension. It economizes attention, for it assists 
the reader in putting emphasis where it is due” (234: 41). Similarly, 
rhythm of expression is an essential element in effective oral reading and 
provides a “significant index to maturity in one’s reading habits.” In a 
study of reading among first-grade pupils, Buswell (53: 92-103) secured 
dictaphone records of their oral reading, “from which the intervals be- 
tween each word were transcribed upon smoked kymograph records.” 
Figure 7 (53: 100) indicates the rhythm of expression of one graduate 
student and twelve first-grade pupils in reading the sentence, “One day 
a red hen found a little wheat seed.” The graduate student (Subject 195) 
read about as follows: “One day —- — a red hen — — found — —a 
little wheat — seed.” The remaining records shown in the figure reveal 
very wide differences in the reading habits of the first-grade pupils with 
respect to rhythm of expression. Only a very few of these pupils had 
acquired satisfactory habits in reading even very simple material. In a 
study of the reading habits of thirty high-school students, Knoche (222) 
found that some of her subjects were mature readers with regard to 
comprehension and rhythm of expression. She found, on the other hand, 
that some of her subjects had not acquired the habit of grouping words 
into thought units and were therefore not mature readers. 
The studies to which reference has been made indicate that many 
pupils acquire rhythmical habits of expression in oral reading somewhere 
between the first grade and the high-school period. Unfortunately, a 
large number do not. Possible explanations are suggested in several 
investigations. In a genetic study of rhythm Squire (348) points out the 
fact that “when the effort of articulation is so great that attention is 
necessarily directed upon the act itself,” grouping disappears. Buswell 
(53: 102) points out a striking example of failure to read with rhythmical 
expression, resulting from a “method of teaching which is primarily 
concerned with words.” Knoche (222: 41) found that in the case of high- 
school pupils failure to read with rhythmical expression is closely related 
to poor comprehension and to certain types of errors, such as the repeti- 
tion of a word or words, the inversion of the order of words, the gross 
mispronunciation of words, and the non-recognition of words. On the 
other hand, speed of oral reading is not always accompanied by intelligent 
grouping into thought units. In fact, many pupils who group words well 
read more slowly than do pupils who read with less distinct rhythm of . 
expression.

156 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
The facts which have been presented can be easily interpreted in 
terms of school practice. In the first place, rhythm of expression in oral 
reading is one of the desirable goals of reading instruction. Since experi- 
ments show that many pupils fail to acquire rhythm of expression, 
specific attention should be given to its development. In view of the fact 
that pupils begin to acquire mature habits in this respect in the primary 
grades, it is legitimate to begin to cultivate effective habits early in 
the grades. Experiments show, however, that rhythm of expression is 
accompanied by a clear grasp of the meaning and by freedom from errors. 
This means that the habits involved in intelligent interpretation, in 
speed and accuracy of recognition, and in a wide eye-voice span must 
be more or less definitely established before rapid progress can be expected 
in rhythm of expression ‘and in effective grouping of words in oral reading. 
The creation of atmosphere—An experimental study (45) has been 
reported of the problem of creating atmosphere “by artists of the spoken 
word” which bears indirectly on the most effective techniques to employ 
in oral reading. Buehler had subjects express certain emotions by “voice 
only,” by “action only,” and by “a combination of voice and action.”’ 
“An effort was made to eliminate some of the obvious factors which deter- 
mine atmosphere, such as physical setting, meaning and emotion, lan- 
guage, and, in some cases, stage presence.” For example, the alphabet, 
instead of words, was used to convey meaning and emotions. The two 
important deductions based on the results of the experiment follow: 
(x) The tone quality of the reader’s voice is a most important factor in 
affecting the emotional tone of an audience. The audience is stirred more by 
the auditory impressions which it receives from the reader than by the visual 
impressions. The response in the audience tends to be largely emotional. (2) 
The expression of the emotions through the symbol of action enables the 
audience to identify the emotion he is expressing; they are more intelligible to 
the audience. The response in the audience tends to be largely intellectual. 
The audience is moved by what it hears and understands ' more than by what 
it sees (45: 44]. 
Effect of changes in the attributes of sound _—Additional suggestions 
concerning desirable qualities of oral reading have been secured through a 
study by Woolbert to determine the effects of changes in auditory stimu- 
lations (pitch, time, pause, and intensity). Eleven modes of reading 
were tried in the experiment, such as median change in all four attributes 
or extreme change in pitch and median change in the other three. The 
most important conclusions follow: 
There is a presumption in favor of using an extreme degree of change in all 
four of the attributes of sound during speech, especially for the purpose of
-P-A-G-E-165
ORAL READING 157 
securing retentiveness over an extended time... .. An even rate is superior 
to a rate excessively broken. ... .- Interference with normal degree of change 
in intensity reduces apprehension, retentiveness, or both. . . . . Elimination of 
changes in quality is greatly inferior to a wide degree of change. [429: 184]. 
Relation of breathing to effective expression —tIn laboratory studies 
(123: 39-415 124: 70-83; 125: 166-72) involving the use of a pneumo- 
graph, C. T. Gray found that reading occurs during expirations. These 
often occur “without modification, while the demands of emphasis are 
being met through pauses dictated by the sense of the passage rather 
than by respiration. In the long run, respiration has to be controlled in 
the interests of interpretation” (124: 77). 
A second fact brought out by Gray deals with the relation of inspira- 
tion periods, which are relatively short, to sense pauses and punctuation 
marks. The records secured show that children do not look ahead to 
determine the points at which inspiration should take place but pause 
only when they are out of breath. Consequently, the points of inspira- 
tion may or may not be at sense pauses or punctuation marks. The meth- 
ods of controlling both inspiration and expiration are left largely to the 
reader’s devices. Consequently, many different types -of control are 
exhibited in the records. Gray is clearly of the opinion that teachers 
should give more training in the control of breathing during oral reading. 
Thus far no experimental evidence has been published concerning the 
procedures to follow in securing the best results. 
Use of the phonograph.—An experiment (419) has been reported in 
which the phonograph was used successfully in improving pronunciation 
habits. After preliminary training in which the same material was read 
by everyone, thirty members of a normal-school class were supplied with 
typewritten copies of material containing words which they mispro- 
nounced frequently. Each read the passages into an Edison phonograph. 
When the readings were reproduced, the errors were pointed out, and 
each subject recorded his own errors. Daily home practice periods of 
ten minutes each were required. At the conclusion of the practice period 
each student was asked to read the material used during the preliminary 
training: period. “These had not been practiced; no reference even had 
been made to them. These two records were then compared, with the 
result that in the second go.4 per cent of the mistakes were absent.” This 
experiment supplies evidence of the value of specific training in one phase 
of oral reading through the use of phonograph records. It remains for 
additional experiments to demonstrate how widely and effectively this 
type of training can be applied in improving the quality of oral reading.

CHAPTER XIII 
CHILDREN’S INTEREST IN READING 
Statement of problem.—Children’s interest in reading is of vital concern 
to elementary-school teachers, parents, and textbook-makers. A prelimi- 
nary analysis of published investigations shows that the most important 
results relate largely to the following topics: the amount of independent 
reading among children, children’s preference for prose, the types of 
books and magazine articles preferred, the qualities or elements that 
determine interest, and the factors that influence children’s preferences. 
AMOUNT OF INDEPENDENT READING 
Tendencies revealed in several studies.—-Significant measures of chil- 
dren’s interest in reading are the percentage who read independently and 
the number of books, magazines, and newspapers which they read. 
Vostrovsky obtained statements from 1,269 pupils of Stockton, California, 
as to whether or not they secured books from the public library. A sum- 
mary of her findings appears in Table XLII (399: 524). This table shows 
that the percentage of both boys and girls who used the library increased 
quite regularly from nine to eighteen years of age. A second fact revealed 
by the table is that a larger percentage of boys than of girls under sixteen 
used the library and that after that age more girls than boys used it.

Smith secured information near the end of the school year from 2,199 
boys and girls above the fifth grade in Iowa City and Council Bluffs, 
Iowa, concerning the number of books of their own selection which they 
had read since the preceding September. The average number of books 
read by the boys and girls of each grade is recorded in Table XLIII 
158
-P-A-G-E-167
CHILDREN’S INTEREST IN READING 159 
(345: 209). This table shows a general increase in the amount:read from 
the sixth grade to the eighth grade and a smaller amount of reading in - 
each year of the high school than in the eighth grade. The explanation 
for this decrease, as pointed out by Smith, is that more library reading 
was assigned in the high school and that the preparation of lessons re- 
quired more time than in the grades. Consequently, there was less time 
for voluntary reading. In view of the fact that the percentage of pupils 
withdrawing books from the library increased in Stockton, California, 
during the high-school period, it would appear that the facts vary for 
different communities. Smith also found that 85 per cent of all pupils 
above the fifth grade read the daily paper and fully as large a percentage 
read at least one magazine a month.

C Studies by Anderson (7), Eaton (87), and Irving (192) show that most 
pupils in the upper grades and in the high school claim to read books, 
magazines, and newspapers voluntary) Inasmuch as these investigators 
did not use the same methods in calculating the amount read, it-is im- 
possible to make rigid comparisons. It seems, however, that the amount 
read varies radically in different’ communities. 
Concluding staiements—The studies which have been referred to 
suggest the following tentative conclusions: (x) The percentage of pupils 
who read independently increases rapidly during the middle and upper 
grades and is relatively. high during the high-school period. (2) The 
average number of books read independently averages from ten to 
twenty a year in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. Two distinct 
tendencies are revealed during the high-school period: (a) to decrease 
the average number of books read, as shown in Smith’s study; (6) to 
maintain a high average throughout the period, as shown in Anderson’s 
study. (3) The habit of reading magazines and newspapers is almost
-P-A-G-E-168
160 "INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
universal above the fifth grade. These conclusions are based on the 
statements of pupils concerning their reading. Studies are needed of the 
actual records of the amount and kind of voluntary reading done by 
elementary-school and high-school pupils. There is also need of studies 
to determine the causes of the wide differences in the reading proclivities 
of pupils in different communities. 
CHILDREN’S PREFERENCE FOR PROSE 
Brief summaries of various studies—In discussing the results of a 
study of children’s choices in reading, Mackintosh (246) asserted that 
“children prefer practically every other type of literature to poetry.”

A number of investigations 6f children’s preferences seem to justify her 
conclusion. For example, Dunn (86), who read pairs of selections to 
primary pupils, found that they showed a decided preference for prose. 
Wissler secured reports from 1,950 elementary-school pupils concerning 
the selection which they liked best in the reader of the previous grade. 
The replies summarized in Table XLIV (423: 532) show a decided prefer- 
ence for prose. The very large increase in preference for poetry in the 
fifth reader is attributed to the use of such poems as Evangeline and 
justifies, according to Wissler, the right of such poems to a place in the 
course of study in the grammar grades. 
Jordan (198: 43-91) submitted a questionnaire to 3,598 pupils, rang- 
ing in age from nine to eighteen years. They were asked to name the:
-P-A-G-E-169
CHILDREN’S INTEREST IN READING . x61 - 
five books which they had read that they liked best. Among the girls, 
books of poetry constituted 3 per cent of the total number of choices. 
The preference for poetry was even less prominent among the boys. The 
fact should be pointed out, however, that specific poems may possibly 
yank much higher than books of poetry. 
Uhl (389: 83-84) ‘presents a view somewhat more favorable to poetry 
than are some of the results which have been reported. A summary 
statement of his findings follows: 
The first poem reported on by them was Excelsior. Only a low percentage 
liked this poem, while the majority stated that they did “not like poetry any- 
how.” In nearly every case, however, the pupils who said that they did dislike 
it stated why they do like The Village Blacksmith, The Barefoot Boy, and The 
One-Hoss Shay. The results here obtained confirm the opinions of many teachers 
who have found that the difficulty is nearly always with certain poems and not 
with poetry in general. This statement holds for both boys and girls so far as 
the results indicate [389: 83~84]. 
Chamberlain (59) secured replies from 880 high-school pupils of Oak 
Park, Iinois, to the question, “Do you like poetry?” The reports showed 
that 38 per cent of the boys and 71 per cent of the girls enjoy poetry and 
that 4o per cent of the boys and 15 per cent of the girls dislike it. The 
remainder of the pupils qualified their statements. The results, according 
to Chamberlain, suggested certain problems for further investigation: 
Are these reactions unique for Oak Park? Is the subject-matter chosen 
of greater interest to girls than to boys? Has poetry been taught i in such 
a manner as to prejudice at least half the boys? 
Problems for further study-—The studies of children’s preferences do 
not justify final conclusions with regard to their interest in poetry. Some 
of the studies which show the greatest dislike for it make comparisons 
which are unfair to poetry. On the other hand, there is clear evidence 
that children favor prose. There is need of studies to determine more 
accurately the extent to which boys and girls prefer prose to poetry. Is 
‘their dislike of poetry due to the inherent nature of this type of literature, 
to the specific selections which have been assigned in the past, or to the 
methods of teaching employed? Is the fact that pupils like prose better 
than poetry justification for omitting it from courses of study? 
TYPES OF BOOKS PREFERRED 
An example of an early study-—Numerous studies have been made of 
the types of books which children prefer. Wissler’s investigation (423) 
will be summarized as an example of one of the early studies which made
-P-A-G-E-170
162 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
use of the questionnaire method. The question which he submitted to 
elementary-school children follows: “If you were taken to a bookstore 
and told that you might select just one book for your own, what would 
you take?” Two hundred and forty-six different titles were named by 
the pupils. These were classified under nine different headings according 
to the type of material they represented. The percentage of boys and 
girls preferring each type is given in Table XLV (423: 536). This table 
shows that fiction, poetry, history, and biography were among the 
preferred classes. Some sex differences are revealed in such cases as 
poetry, history, and science. The original records showed much more 
originality of choice on the part of the boys, as indicated by the wider 
range of titles suggested. Such studies as Wissler’s are open to the

criticisms that the choices are limited to the material which pupils have 
encountered and that pupils may not recall what they most prefer. 
Summary of fourteen published studies.—In 1921 Jordan (198: 1-42) 
published a summary of ten questionnaire studies of the interests of 
children in reading, one study among adults about their reading interests 
when children, ‘two studies based on observation and experiment, and 
one study based on library withdrawals. The results of these studies 
varied with communities and with the conditions under which they were 
made, Nevertheless, they suggested certain general tendencies. These 
were summarized by Jordan as follows: 
In some matters thére is substantial agreement. Both boys and girls read 
more fiction than anything else and like it better. In nine cases out of ten girls 
read more fiction than boys. Whenever this fiction has been analyzed, there is 
a general concurrence of opinion that boys prefer fiction of adventure; that 
girls, particularly in the high-school period, are greatly interested in sentiment 
and emotion; that they like, especially in the lower grades, stories about children
-P-A-G-E-171
9 
CHILDREN’S INTEREST IN READING 163 
like themselves, and, in the upper grades, about people like themselves. These 
stories show also that girls in the high-school period like novels of the day which 
concern manners and daily life. Girls do not like history and biography as much 
as do boys. During the high-school years girls do like the biographies of men 
heroes, but they prefer those of women, and in their ideals prefer characters 
from fiction rather than those from real life. 
- The interest of girls in travel, adventure, and science is almost negligible. 
Boys often show a real liking for history, sometimes as early as in Grade IV. 
Many boys give history as a first choice. They display very little interest in 
books on travel or science, though more than the girls. 
With increasing age, preferences for juvenile fiction give way to preferences 
for adult fiction, and preferences for poetry increase [198: 41]. 
Results of a questionnaire study.—Following this summary study, 
Jordan (198: 43-91) secured information from 3,598 pupils from nine 
to eighteen years of age concerning the books and magazines which they 
liked best. The preferences of boys and girls for different types of books

are indicated by ranks in Table XLVI (198: 48-49). This table shows 
that boys prefer books of adventure to pure fiction, as suggested by 
Jordan in his summary of previous investigations. Assuming for the 
_ moment that the books were classified by Jordan on the same basis as 
in the previous investigations, we have here an example of variations in 
the preferences of different groups of boys. 
The preferences of the same boys and girls for different types of 
material in magazines is shown by ranks in Table XLVII (198: 78-79). 
A comparison of Tables XLVI and XLVII shows several distinct changes 
in the order of preference. For example, science articles assume third
-P-A-G-E-172
  164 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
place for the boys in magazine articles, while books on science occupy 
tenth place. In the case of the girls, woman’s arts assumes first rank and 
fiction drops to second place. The introduction of such new types of 
material as current events and woman’s arts results in decided changes in 
the ranks of many types of material. It is evident from these findings 
that children’s preference for this or that type of material depends to a 
considerable extent on the types of material involved in the comparison. 
The preferences of boys and girls as they have just been discussed 
are based on central tendencies. An examination of more detailed records 
reveals a great deal of overlapping in the interests of the sexes. For 
example, Jordan found that 18 per cent of the boys and 42 per cent of the

girls preferred books of fiction, that 15 per cent of the hoys and 35 per 
cent of the girls preferred stories, and that 58 per cent of the boys and 18 
per cent of the girls preferred adventure. An additional fact revealed by 
his records is that interest was shown in given types of material by chil- 
dren of widely different age groups. For example, children of each age 
group from nine to eighteen years of age expressed preference for novels, 
stories, and adventure. 
A careful study of his findings led Jordan to the following conclusions: 
(z) Boys and girls differ notably in their interest in both book and maga- 
zine reading. (2) Boys are most interested in adventure and girls in fiction. 
(3) Interest in fiction increases rapidly from nine to eighteen years of age in 
the case of both boys and girls. Juvenile fiction in books, however, declines 
rapidly in popularity between the ages of nine and thirteen; in magazine 
reading the decline is most rapid after the twelfth year. (4) Boys begin 
i

to acquire interest in science between the ages of nine and eleven; their 
interest in current events increases rapidly from nine to eighteen years of 
age, and their interest in adventure begins to wane after the thirteenth 
_ year. (5) Girls show increased interest in adventure between the ages of 
nine and thirteen and in poetry between the ages of fourteen and eighteen; 
there is a decrease in their interest in pictures throughout most of the 
period; and there is a very rapid increase of interest in current events 
between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. (6) “Boys and girls are alike 
in their failure to choose to any large extent books on science, information, 
travel, biography, and history, and magazines on humor and nature.” 
Interest in informational material—An investigation by Uhl (390) 
offers a partial explanation for the indifference of boys and girls to much 
of the informational reading material referred to in such ‘studies as 
Jordan’s. Eighty-two seventh- and eighth-grade pupils were asked to 
read a series of selections from Lessons in Community and National Life 
and “to report in writing whether or not they liked them, giving reasons 
for their judgments.’ The reports showed almost unanimous interest in 
these selections. The reasons given were specific and unequivocal. 
Furthermore, the comments were more complete than were the comments 
in the case of such selections as “Paul Revere’s Ride,” “Marco Bozarris,” 
“Christmas at the Cratchitts,” and Lincoln’s “Gettysburg Address.” 
Uhl found that the selections which he used were far more popular than 
informational selections in readers. The teachers’ criticisms of the lat- 
ter included the following types of statements: “too mature,” “too ab- 
stract,” “hard constructions,” “hard words,” “uninteresting.” On the 
basis of his findings Uhl concluded that “the newer informational pas- 
sages are as popular’ as are any of the superior passages reported by 
teachers, that lack of interest in informational material in readers 
_ “may be due to the form in which it is written rather than to lack of 
interest in informational content,” and that “informational selections 
for use in school should be written especially for the pupils and not culled 
from masterpieces written for the use of adults.” 
Children’s interests as revealed through a library situdy.—A final study 
to be summarized at this point was made by Jordan (198: 92-129) of the 
books actually used and asked for by children in eight libraries in and 
near New York City. He made personal studies in each library lasting 
from one to three weeks, during which time over eight hundred observa- 
tions were recorded. His findings suggested certain very interesting facts: 
(t) Boys are primarily interested in fiction relating to war and scouting, 
to school and sports, to Boy Scouts, and to strenuous adventure. (2) 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
166 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
The chief interest of boys in non-fiction centers around “what-and-how- 
to-do” books. “The Boy Scout Manual is by far the most popular of this 
group, although books on aeroplanes, submarines, kites, engines, puzzles, 
and magic are in certain seasons very much sought after.” (3) Boys’ 
interest in biography and history “is confined to those authors who can 
write history and biography in the form of an exciting story.” (4) The 
most popular boys’ magazines are St. Nicholas, Popular Mechartcs, 
Scientific American, American Boy, and Boys’ Life. (5) The interests of 
girls are concerned chiefly with fiction which portrays the following 
themes: home (37 per cent), home and school (19 per cent), school (15 
per cent), love (7 per cent), fairy stories (6 per cent), and stories with 
historical background (6 per cent). (6) “Except for a few books én cook- 
ing, crocheting, dramatics, and poetry, girls fail to show interest in non- 
fiction.” (7) Girls do little magazine reading other than in St. Nicholas. 
Concluding statements—The various studies to which reference has 
been made do not supply conclusive evidence concerning the types of 
books and magazine articles which children prefer. It is clear that chil- 
dren’s interests are quite varied, that adventure is very popular among 
boys and fiction among girls, that the interests of boys and girls and of 
different age groups overlap to a considerable extent, and that books and 
selections on science, information, travel, biography, and history are 
preferred by a relatively small percentage of boys and girls. A partial . 
explanation of this lack of interest in informational material lies in the fact 
that much of it is written for adults rather than for children. Justification 
for this statement is found in the fact that at least two studies show that 
this type of material is read with keen interest when it is successfully 
written for children. 
The fact that the results of different studies vary considerably sug~ 
gests the possibility that dominant interests differ with communities, 
probably on account of the types of material to which pupils have access, 
There is need of additional investigations to determine the interests in 
different types of material at various ages when such variables as style 
and difficulty have been eliminated or controlled. In. the meantime, 
teachers should provide a rich variety of reading material and should 
study the interests and tastes of individual children rather than emphasize 
exclusively materials of a particular type for a given age or sex group. 
QUALITIES OR ELEMENTS THAT DETERMINE INTEREST 
An example of an early study Numerous efforts have been made 
during the last twenty-five years to determine scientifically the themes, 
qualities, or factors that determine interest in reading material. As 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
CHILDREN’S INTEREST IN READING 167 
early as 1898 Wissler (423) secured reports from 1,950 elementary-school 
children in Grades III to VIII, inclusive, concerning (x) the selections that 
they preferred most in the readers used during the previous year and (2) 
the reasons for their choices. A tabulation of the reasons for their prefer- 
ences revealed the following facts: 27 per cent of the girls and 24 per cent 
of the boys preferred stories “true to life”; 26 per cent of the girls and 20 
per cent of the boys preferred stories containing “mnoral lessons”; ro per 
cent of the girls and 16 per cent of the boys preferred stories of the 
“heroic”; and 8 per cent of the girls and ro per cent of the boys preferred 
stories containing “information.” Other qualities were mentioned less 
frequently. After an analysis of the records, the author reached the follow- 
ing conclusions: “Take out of their textbooks the sermon, the philosophi- 
cal fable, and the cold stiff hero, and paint into them the good, the true, 
and the heroic in colors from life.” It is significant that the adult charac- 
ter of the reading materials provided for children was thus seriously chal- 
lenged more than a quarter of a century ago. 
Interest factors in primary reading —Dunn. (86) selected 243 samples 
of primary reading material, including fictional prose, factual prose, and 
verse. These were classified by seven expert primary teachers and a 
specialist in abnormal psychology into ten groups on the basis of interest 
for pupils of the first three grades. After these selections had been ranked, 
_ thirty-one were chosen for use in the experiment. These were arranged 
into forty pairs and read to 195 different classes. After each pair was read, 
the pupils expressed their preferences. The next step was to select the 
“elemental qualities” or characteristics which account for the greater 
interest in one sample than in another. To this end, twenty qualities were 
selected from previous investigations and from statements by textbook- 
makers. The thirty-one samples were then submitted to adult judges 
with the request that they rank them from 1 to 7 for each of the twenty 
qualities. An elaborate statistical treatment of the data led to the follow- 
ing conclusions: 
Lo Characteristics which may be expected to cause interest in primary children 
are, it appears, surprise and plot for both sexes, animaness for boys, and child- 
(ness, familiar experience, and to a lesser degree repetition and conversation for 
girls. It is significant that the interest value of surprise outranks that of plot, 
since thereby a large amount of factual material, lacking the story element, but 
abounding in elements of wonder and unexpectegness, is of promise as affording 
_ interesting redding material for primary childte i (86: 46]. , 
Throughout this investigation nothing has been found which, from the 
standpoint of interest, warrants the highly partial selection at present charac- 
teristic of primary readers. Nothing here indicates that the child is in an‘ “age

of pure fancy” nor that legends and folk tales as a class are the most interesting 
of all possible material for primary pupils. As for poetry, the evidence is all 
against, rather than for, its very large proportion in primary reading material. 
Instead of this limited range of liking, a child’s tastes appear to be rather 
catholic. Give him a few important elemental qualities which may enter into 
fact or fiction, into prose or verse, into real or fanciful situations, and he is 
attracted and pleased [86: 40}. 
This broad interpretation of children’s interests harmonizes with the 
conclusions reached in the previous section concerning the selections which 
" children prefer. In order to determine more accurately the importance of 
the factors listed, additional experiments are desirable with groups of 
pupils classified on the basis of age, grade, intelligence level, home environ- 
ment, and reading achievement. 
Important qualities of reading material —Uhl (389) secured judgments 
from over three thousand teachers in Grades I to Vill, inclusive, concern- 
ing the value of several thousand selections. A list of selections was then 
submitted to the teachers of each grade in forty-nine cities, with the 
request that they select the fifteen best suited for their respective grades 
and number them in the order of merit. They were also asked to list the 
qualities which were the most prominent in each selection. In order to 
check these judgments, tests based on certain standard selections were 
given to 529 pupils in Grades III to VIII, inclusive. The pupils’ interest 
in each selection and their comprehension of it were determined. A high 
correlation was found between teachers’ judgments and pupils’ interests. 
The qualities of the selections which were reported by the teachers as 
undesirable follow: “abstractness,” “lack of action,” “unreality,” “too 
great length,” “gloominess,” “monotony,” and “poor literary style.” The 
most important qualities of desirable selections together with their weight- 
ings for each grade are presented in Table XLVIII (389: 125). 
Several significant tendencies are revealed by Table XLVIII. “Dra- 
matic action, adventure, and heroic,” “humor,” and “interesting prob- 
lems or character study” increase in importance throughout the grades. 
“Fairy and supernatural” are most prominent in the third and fourth 
grades; “kindness and faithfulness,” in the third, fourth, and fifth grades; 
and “interesting characters, home life or child life,” in the fifth and sixth 
grades. “About animals and personification,” “availability for dramatiza- 
tion,” and “interesting repetition” are relatively important in the first 
grade, of decreasing importance in the second and third grades, and of 
relatively little value above the third grade. The discussion thus far has 
emphasized the changes in interest from grade to grade. An additional fact
-P-A-G-E-177
CHILDREN’S INTEREST IN READING 169 
revealed by Table XLVIII is even more significant, namely, that many 
of these interest elements appeal to children in all elementary grades. 
Interest elements in prose selections —Garnett (101) presented eighty 
prose selections to the pupils of the fourth grade of the Elementary School 
of the University of Iowa and secured statements of their preferences. 
The twenty-four selections which ranked the highest were then read 
without comment to the same pupils and to the children of six fourth- 
grade classes in Minneapolis. By means of a system of daily, weekly, and 
final voting, the children indicated their “first preferred stories,” their 
“second preferred stories,” and their “least liked stories.” An analysis

of the reasons given for liking certain stories and for disliking others 
resulted in a list of elements which seem to make selections attractive for 
pupils of the fourth grade. Table XLIX (101: 137) lists these elements 
for boys and girls separately in the order of “discovered preference.” 
- The value of this study is limited by the fact that only twenty-four 
selections were included. As a result, some important elements were 
doubtless omitted. Nevertheless, there are distinct similarities in the con- 
clusions of Uhl and Garnett. The differences may be due to the limitation 
mentioned, to the terminology used in classifying interest elements, or to 
variations in the interests of the groups of pupils studied. 
Interest elements in poetry.—In connection with a study of children’s 
choices in poetry Mackintosh (246) made a study of the reasons given by:
-P-A-G-E-178
170 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
fifth-grade children for liking certain poems. When these were tabulated 
and reduced to percentages, the results were as follows: “funny,” 32.00 
per cent; “relating to subject-matter,” 23.25 per cent; “miscellaneous,”’ 
17.40 per cent; “dialect,” 6.95 per cent; “exciting,” 6.75 per cent; “inter- 
esting,” 6.40 per cent; “war,” 4.65 per cent, “rhythm,” 3.65 per cent; 
“story,” .9§ per cent. These results are distinctly different from those 
secured by Garnett in her study of prose selections. Unfortunately, the 
classifications used by the two investigators differ radically. Comparative 
studies of the interest elements in prose and poetry are needed in which a 
common classification of elements is used. 
A study of the interests of high-school pupils —In 1916 Bell and Sweet 
(20) reported a tabular study of the reading interests of high-school pupils.

A list of rro authors and seventy-nine titles was prepared with blank 
spaces for additions. The pupils of the Austin, Texas, high school were 
asked to check the books read and to add others. One column contained 
space for reasons for liking or disliking each book read. Four hundred 
and forty replies were received. An analysis of the reports revealed the 
‘ollowing elements of interest: “plot,” “character,” “description,” “mor- 
al,” “fancy,” “pathos,” “humor,” “historical interest,” “realism,” 
“style,” “gruesomeness.” “Plot” was the preferred element among the 
girls. The percentage in each class preferring it ranged from 33 to 44. 
“Plot” was also preferred by the boys in from 28 to 56 per cent of the 
cases, except in the low ninth grade, where it dropped to 12 per cent. 
“Fancy,” “pathos,” and “historical interest” were mentioned very in- 
frequently. The remainder of the elements were preferred in from 0 to 29 
per cent of the cases. Most of them varied from 5 to to per cent. 
A comparison of the results of the studies reported in this section
-P-A-G-E-179
CHILDREN’S INTEREST IN READING : I7t 
reveals common elements of interest among elementary-school and high- 
school pupils. These are suggested by the terms “plot,” “character,” 
“humor,” and “moral.” Differences are evidenced in the high rank of 
“plot” and in the introduction of new terms, such as “realism,” “style,” 
and “gruesomeness.” It is quite probable that some of these interest ele- 
ments are referred to by other terms in the elementary-school classifica- 
tions. 
' Concluding statements.—The results of the studies of Dunn, Uhl, Gar- 
nett, and Bell and Sweet are both interesting and significant. They chal- 
lenge the use of much of the material in current readers. They reveal a 
surprising breadth of interest at each grade level rather than highly 
specialized interests. When the fact is recalled that Uhl] found that in- 
formational material proves very interesting when successfully written 
for children, the possibility of greatly enlarging the scope of reading 
material for each grade increases. 
FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE CHILDREN’S PREFERENCES 
Statement of problem—The comment is frequently made that, for 
the most part, children choose to read cheap and undesirable types of 
fiction. It is encouraging to know, however, that the interests of children 
can be directed to a greater or lesser extent. It is the purpose of this 
section to summarize the results of experiments which reveal factors that 
influence children’s preferences in reading. 
Effect of physical make-up of books.—Bamberger (16) conducted a 
series of experiments to determine which of the physical qualities of books 
affected the choice of first-, second-, and third-grade pupils in five schools. 
Favorite stories, such as Cinderella, were read to them up to a designated 
point. In each case the pupils were then asked if they would like to finish 
the story and were given an opportunity to choose from at least five edi- 
tions, differing in size, binding, type of illustrations, and amount of con- 
tent. As each child indicated his choice, the examiner recorded it, to- 
gether with the reasons which were given for the selection. 
An analysis of the records led to the following conclusions: (r) “The 
size most acceptable to the children in the primary grades appears to be 
about seven and one-half inches long by five inches wide and one inch 
thick.” Additional experiments are suggested to determine if larger sizes 
are more acceptable. (2) “The color of the cover exerts an influence. 
Brightness is a pleasing factor for children. Blue, red, and yellow are the 
favorite colors for covers.” (3) Titles influence book selection. (4) “Nu- 
merous illustrations make a book acceptable to children. Twenty-five per
-P-A-G-E-180
172 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
cent of the book-space seems the minimum amount of space to be devoted 
to pictures to make a book acceptable to little children. Large, full-page 
pictures are preferred to smaller ones inserted irregularly in the text.” 
(5) The colors preferred in pictures “are rather crude and elementary, 
having a high degree of saturation and a great deal of brightness. Older 
children gradually grow into a preference for softer tints and tones.” (6) 
“Humor and action in pictures make an appeal to primary children.” (7) 
“Pictures that have story-telling qualities have a high attraction.” (8) 
“A fair number of stories in a familiar field attract children to a book.”’ 
(9) “A wide margin appears to be attractive, an average width of at least 
one inch should be used.”

Some of these conclusions are tentative and require further experi- 
mental work for verification. Nevertheless, the results suggest a type of 
consideration to which but little attention has been given in the past. 
Relation of reading achievement to amount and kind of material read.— 
Green gave the Haggerty test for achievement in reading to five hundred 
sixth- and seventh-grade pupils. A record was also made of the kind’ and 
amount of reading for fun which the pupils did during a period of three 
months. Table L (143: 615) shows that there is a very close.relation be- 
tween the achievement of pupils and the amount of reading done. 
The reading material reported included “historical and geographical,”’ 
“fairy tales and myths,” “nature stories and nature facts,” “stories of 
adventure,” and “romance.” When the pupils were grouped into four
-P-A-G-E-181
CHILDREN’S INTEREST IN READING ‘ 173 
classes on the basis of ability, as indicated in the table, it was found that 
every type of material except fairy tales, was reported by each group. 
Furthermore, the various types of material read differed in character for 
each of the four groups. This fact was illustrated by the author as follows: 
In score span 10 to 34 they read Dutch Twins, Belgian Twins, Four Great 
Americans, Columbus, The Great Wide World, etc.; in score span 35 to 59 there 
were such books as Story of Spain, Montezuma, Napoleon, Long Ago in Greece, 
Merry England, and Colonial Stories. In score span 75 to 94 were such books as 
Texas Heroes, Boy’s Roosevelt Book, The Spy, and Uncle Tom’s Cabin, while in 
score span 9§ to 124 were such books as The Spy, The Crisis, and Ben Hur 
[x43: 616]. 
It is impossible to determine from this quotation just what the quali- 
tative differences were. It is apparent, however, that differences existed. 
This type of study should be carried much farther in order to determine 
more fully the kinds of reading material that appeal most strongly at 
various levels of reading achievement. 
Influence of teachers’ preferences.—In a study including seventy-three 
classes from the third grade to the eighth grade, inclusive, Wightman 
(417) proceeded as follows: secured from the teachers the names of five 
books on the lists for their respective grades which, in their judgments, 
were enjoyed most by pupils; secured from the pupils 150 days later their 
first, second, and third choices of readers used during the year with reasons 
for their choices; secured from the pupils thirty days later a list of the 
five readers which they enjoyed more than any of the other books read 
that year. 
An examination of the two lists secured from the pupils revealed a 
marked similarity so far as a given pupil or class was concerned. In fact, 
“70.6 per cent of all the 1,864 pupils preferred the same two books as 
first and second choice.’ On the other hand, there were distinct differ- 
ences in the preferences of different classes. For example, 90.3 per cent 
of the pupils of one eighth-grade class favored as first choice a book men- 
tioned by only 6.2 per cent of the pupils of another class on any of their 
three choices. An explanation of these differences was secured when the 
preferences of the pupils were compared with the preferred lists of the 
teachers. “The book the teacher most preferred and was enthusiastic 
over was pretty generally the one the class preferred.” 
The lesson taught by this experiment, as explained by Wightman, “is 
that interest and inspiration are contagious and are essential if the great 
majority of the public-school children ever form a love for,reading.” If 
other experiments of a similar type confirm these findings, schools should

ir 
“Take every advantage of the enthusiasm of teachers for wholesome types 
of children’s literature. 
Influence of developing standards —Green (144) reports a very signifi- 
cant experiment among seventh-grade classes. Forty-five minutes was 
reserved each day for voluntary reading. At first, the discussion of books 
was quite informal. Gradually, a desire developed to discover good books - 
to read. Book reviews were introduced and discussed. Groups of pupils 
became interested in available lists of books. Different groups devoted 
their attention to books of various types. The following standards were 
finally developed and adopted: 
A book, to be on our lists, must be about something we want to know about. 
It must be written in words we can understand. If it tries to state facts, they 
must be accurate. If it tells a story involving what is true to life, the story must 
not be so overdrawn as to be ridiculous. It must become more interesting as the 
story proceeds. It must be told in good English [144: 391]. 
When the books were reported by one group to the class as a whole, 
they were critically considered. If accepted, they were placed on the list 
of approved books, Not infrequently they were referred back to the 
original group for further investigation. 
The effect of this type of training was measured in the case of 210 
pupils in two schools. ‘School No. 9 showed a 68 per cent increase in the 
amount of home reading for fun following the experiment. School No. 20 
showed a 34 per cent increase.” With regard to the type of material read, 
76 per cent of the reading for fun by the pupils of one school was from the 
material reported to them during the experiment. The corresponding 
percentage for the other school was 71. In the judgment of the author, 
the experiment was successful because it developed standards for use in 
selecting reading material. Although these data are not altogether con- 
clusive, they suggest large possibilities in directing the preferences of pupils 
through carefully planned instruction. 
Concluding statements.—The studies of Bamberger, Green, and Wight- 
man relate to one of the most vital problems in teaching reading. Numer- 
ous studies are necessary in order to determine the various factors which 
influence the interests of pupils in reading and which lead to desirable 
tastes. Inasmuch as the pupils at each grade level differ radically in such 
matters as home environment, breadth of experience, and native capacity, 
studies are needed to determine the best methods to use in different grades 
in establishing permanent interests in reading. ‘

CHAPTER XIV 
THE NATURE AND CONTENT OF READING MATERIALS 
‘Statement of the problem.—During a period in which the curriculum is 
undergoing radical reorganization, it would be natural to assume that the 
nature and content of the materials of reading instruction should be care- 
fully investigated. A survey of the literature, however, reveals the fact 
that a relatively small number of investigations have been ‘made in this 
field as compared with the number of studies of the processes involved in 
reading.f‘The investigations which have been reported may be classified 
into the following groups:(studies of the reading materials recommended 
in courses of study9studies vf the reading materials provided or actually 
used§and studies of the content of readers. Several studies of reading 
vocabylaries are also summarized at the end of.this chapter. They do : 
not relate directly to the content of readers, but they are included be- 
cause the vocabulary of a reader as well as the content must be con- 
sidered in determining the appropriateness of the reader for a given grade. 
READING MATERIALS RECOMMENDED IN COURSES OF STUDY. 
Literature in the reading curriculum a decade or more ago.—In 1913 
Bobbitt, Boyce, and Perkins (34) reported the results of a study to deter- 
mine the books and selections used in reading classes in the;warious grades. 
Fifty courses of study were examined for this purpose: Thirty-six of them 
were city courses of study, and fourteen were state courses of study, The: 
original tabulation included 138 authors and 296 titles. The published! 
listscontain 183 titles which were recommended four or more times. The 
authors arranged these titles in two lists. {The first is an alphabetical list 
by authors and shows the total number of times each bookor selection 
was recommended, the grade for which it was recommended most fre- 
quently, and the range of grades for which it was recommended. The 
second list includes “the selections most frequently used in each grade, 
in the order of their frequency.” This list is limited to the selections ap- 
pearing nine of more times. The essential value of the list is that it 
represents the consensus of practice a decade or more ago. The list is 
limited largely to so-called “Jiterary” books and selections and is open to all 
the criticisms to which stidies based on “frequency of practice” are 
subjected. . 
. tS
-P-A-G-E-184
176 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Library books and supplementary readers.—A very significant develop- 
ment was shown in a study by Munson and Hoskinson (271) published in 
1917. Their purpose was to determine the prevailing practice with regardy 
to the use of library books and supplementary readers. In the investiga- 
tion the courses of study for fifty cities were examined. The original 
tabulations, which included all the books mentioned in these courses of 
study, contained 1,342 titles. Those which appeared fewer than five times 
were eliminated from the published lists. The remaining 912 titles, in- 
cluding duplications in different grades, were distributed as shown in 
Table LI (271: 34). This table shows a distinct preference for library 
books above the primary grades. This is a very significant fact, for it 
indicates wider and more varied reading opportunities than so-called

be made to determine whether this preference for library material has 
become more or less marked during the last decade. ~ 
STUDIES OF READING MATERIALS PROVIDED OR ACTUALLY USED 
A quantitative study of reading materials used in first-grade classes— 
Ina study of practices in teaching first-grade reading in Michigan, Woody 
(427) secured from teachers of ten cities lists of different books and | 
materials read during each half of the school year. Forty-nine titles were - 
given for the first five months and a much longer list for the s¢cond five 
months. The tabulations reveal “a surprisingly large number of different 
sources of reading material used, For the first five months the Aldine 
primer is mentioned much more often than any other single source; the 
Free and Treadwell and the Elson-primers follow next in order. Seventeen

different sources are mentioned but a single time, and seventeen more are 
mentioned from two to nine times. For the second five months the four 
books mentioned most frequently are the Elson, the Aldine, the Free and 
Treadwell, and the Progressive Road first readers.” It is interesting to 
know which books are used most frequently in ten large cities. Very little 
significance should be attached to the findings, however. In the first 
place, frequency of use is not necessarily an accurate index of merit. In 
, the second place, inconsistencies appear in the reports from the teachers 
which indicate that they are more or less unreliable.

An analytical study of reading materials provided in one city —A much 
more valuable type of study was made by Bobbitt in connection with the 
Indianapolis survey of reading. He first collected copies of all the required 
and supplementary reading material in each grade. Table LIT (32: 674- 
80) shows the actual number of pages of each type. The average number 
of pages read and the highest and the lowest number of pages read are | 
indicated for certain grades. This table shows a relatively small amount 
of required reading in the lower grades and a somewhat meager amount 
of supplementary material in the upper grades. It is also evident that: 
some schools “read about everything placed at their disposal, while 
others cover but a minor fraction of it.”
-P-A-G-E-186
178 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Bobbitt studied the reading materials to determine the extent to 
which they provided experience in such fields as geography, history, 
industry, nature, science, health, and literature. He found, for example, 
that twelve books provided experience in the field of geography. An 
analysis of these books showed that éne was “too difficult, abstract, and 
didactic” for the grade for which it was recommended; another was 
criticized as “good for fact learning and discussion but not for reading 
experience.” Although such criticisms were largely subjective, they sug- 
gested tentative standards which could be used in selecting appropriate 
reading materials for pupils at given levels of advancement. There is 
need of additional studies to determine the adequacy of the content of 
reading courses from a qualitative point of view. In this connection 
objective standards should be developed by which reading materials can 
be accurately judged. 
Value of books recommended in English._—An investigation not unlike 
Bobbitt’s Indianapolis study in general purpose was reported by Koch 
(223). Her specific aim was to determine the extent to wh'* *-* 
recommended in high-school English departments were v 
widening the geographical horizon of readers, one of the aims a 
teaching as stated by the Committee on the Reorganization ._ 0... 
In order to determine what high-school pupils read, or are expected to 
read, thirty-five reading lists and courses of study were secured from 
representative high schools throughout the country. The composite list 
secured from these sources included 4,025 titles. Those which were 
mentioned fifteen or more times.were studied carefully for geographical 
material. The quotation which follows indicates the type of information 
which was secured. 
Nine of the ninety-seven books had no geographical significance at all. 
Forty of them pictured the United States, twenty-six England, five France, four 
Canada, three Scotland, two Italy, and two Palestine. .... Alaska, Germany, 
India, Persia, and Spain each had one book respectively, while Ireland, Sweden, 
Russia, Japan, and China, to mention only a few of the omissions, were not 
revealed at all {[223: 19s]. 
‘The conclusion to which this study Jed was that a revision of the 
reading lists of English departments is essential. “To do this it is neces- 
sary to make a careful study of existing literature on various parts of the 
world, to incorporate into the reading lists any suitable literature which 
is found to reveal various countries that are inadequately treated at the 
present, to be on the alert for the discovery of all new and available 
material as it appears, to ask for material to be prepared when it does not

seem to exist, and to realize to the full the importance of broadening the 
pupil’s geographical horizon’’ (223: 198). 
This kind of investigation is very significant and should be extended 
to include other essential types of material. As a preliminary step, stand- 
ards should be adopted for determining the appropriateness of references’ 
to particular fields. For example, it is apparent that one country may 
be much more adequately treated in ten books than another in twenty- 
five or even fifty. Furthermore, it is questionable whether facts about 
countries are as illuminating as are examples of important geographic 
principles, such as the relation of man’s occupation to his environment. 
There is abundant opportunity here for most valuable research both in 
establishing standards of judgment and in evaluating current reading 
lists. . 
INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CONTENT OF READERS 46 
Religious element in school readers.—One of the most comprehensive 
studies of the content of readers was made by Tingelstad (384), who 
studied 832 different readers and primers and the reading matter in 
spellers to determine the proportion of religious material which they con-_ 
_ tained. In the case of the readers the percentage of lessons containing 
~ religious and semi-religious references was determined, The number of 
pages containing the name of the Deity or of Christ was also determined. 
Table LIII reveals the early and rapid disappearance of religious material 
from readers. Various sections of Tingelstad’s report discuss the decline in. 
references to God and to Christ and in the use of material from the cate-_ 
chism, from Christian moral doctrine, and from theological dogmas, The 
study shows practically the complete elimination of the religious element 
from readers since 1750. 
The literary element in twenty-two sets of readers —Hosic (179) reported 
a study of the content of twenty-two sets of readers in more or less com- 
mon use which reveals the prominence of the literary ideal today as 
contrasted with the dominance of the religious ideal a century and a4 
half ago. He first tabulated the titles of all selections, a total of 4,300. 
~ From these were deducted brief excerpts from longer selections and the 
first-grade selections which provided vocabulary opportunity. The re- 
maining four thousand selections were written by 1,160 authors, several 
of whom were editors or “rewriters” of longer selections. Fifty-seven 
authors were represented by ten or more selections each. The ten authors 
or sources mentioned most freqyently, together with their frequencies, 
follow: Aesop, retort, gr; Stevenson, 72; Shakespeare,): 69; 
Scott, 52; Tennyson, 50; Whittier, 50; Dickens, 48; Wordsworth, 40; the
-P-A-G-E-188
180 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Bible, 40. Of the fifty-seven authors referred to, “less than half are 
American. The writings of thirty of the authors are wholly in verse, and 
those ef eleven more are partly so.” It is evident that one of the dominat- 
ing aims of the authors of sets of readers has been to provide children 
with opportunity to read good literature. 
Another fact emphasized by the study relates to the frequency with 
which selections are used in the twenty-two sets of readers. Twenty-five 
hundred, or 60 per cent of them, appear but once; 214 appear from 5 to 9 
times; 45 appear from ro to 14 times; and 12 appear from 15 to 19 times. 
No selection appears more than nineteen times. Hosic interprets these 
facts to mean that there is lack of consensus of opinion as to what children 
should read in the field of literature. It is possible, on the other hand, that

  the authors of these books made conscious effort to avoid duplication. 
In any case, there is need of analytical studies to determine the extent to 
which the selections in sets of readers provide experiences that are essen- 
tial; Reference will be made to a few such studies in a later section. 
LK Classification of the content of readers——Starch made an analysis of 
ten readers for each grade selected from twenty-four sets of readers to 
determine the specific nature of their content and the significant changes 
from grade to grade. Sixteen types of content were selected as the basis 
of classification. The percentage of the content belonging to each type 
was then determined. The results for each grade are shown in Table 
LIV (354: 147). This table reveals noteworthy differences between the 
types of content in lower-grade and upper-grade readers. “Aside from 
poetry, the three leading classes in the first grade are ‘animals,’ ‘boys and 
girls,’ and ‘folklore.’ These three groups, together with poetry, constitute 
over three-fourths (76.4 per cent) of all the material. On the other hand, : SN
-P-A-G-E-189

the four chief classes in the eighth grade are ‘classics,’ ‘history and patriot- 
ism,’ ‘biography,’ and ‘poetry.’ These four groups constitute over four- 
fifths (81.7 per cent) of all the material, aside from poetry” (354% 147). 
Although certain general tendencies are revealed by the average. 
percentages in Table LIV, it is significant that there was a very widerange - 
in the proportion of various types of material for a-given grade. For 
example, the range in the fourth grade for “animals” was from o to 19.5 
per cent; for “boys and girls,” from o to 30.8 per cent; for “folklore,” from 
o to 7.5-per cent; and for “fables,” from o to 14.2 per cent. Equally wide

  variations were reported by Woody (425) as a result of a study of the ae 
content of fifteen second readers. These facts:make it clear that there are © 
wide differences of opinion as to the most appropriate types of material 
at each level of advancement. They also support Hosic’s contention that 
there is little agreement among textbook-makers as to what children 
shotild read. 
“WY Critical studies of the content of readers for specific grades.—Disapproval 
of much of ‘the content of readers has been expressed in a number of 
investigatidns, For example, Vinal made an analysis of the content of 
thirty-three of the “best and most used first-grade readers.” Table LV 
(396: 372) contains a condensed summary of his findings. In interpreting
-P-A-G-E-190
182 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
these data, Vinal points out the fact that “true-to-nature stories” and 
“stories about the ordinary doings of animals” do not appear as frequently 
as they should. His challenge to textbook-makers follows:: ‘ 
The writers of first-grade readers have the preconceived idea that the 
unreal is a necessary preparation for literature. This inherited custom hinders 
the writers from proceeding in a natural way, and so they distort the mind of 
the child for months with the literary method of the savage [396: 3/9]. 
An intensive study of the place of the real and the imaginary in the 
reading material of first-grade pupils is very much needed, 
Second-grade readers have been severely criticized by Stone (361) 
because there ‘is so much duplication of material in them. In an analysis 
of the content of fifteen readers he found a total of seventy-seven selec-

tions which were duplicated in one or more books. Only one book con- 
tained no duplications. All the remaining books contained from thirty to 
130 pages of duplications. Fifty per cent or more of the space in each of 
eight of the fifteen books was devoted to selections which appeared in 
other readers. From go to 100 per cent of the space in each of four books 
was devoted to duplications. Furthermore, Stone found selections used 
in the readers for 4 grade duplicated in readers for higher or lower grades, 
For example, “a fourth reader belonging to one of these series contains 
eight selections found in the second readers included in this investigation.” 
These facts do not agree fully with Hosic’s findings concerning the number 
_of repetitions of the same title. It is evident, however, that, so far as the 
second grade is concerned, teachers and school officers face the problem 
of selecting reading materials critically in order to insure a rich variety 
of content with few or no duplications. 
fi Herriott (167) pointed out the fact that eighth-grade readers contain 
a smaller amount of social-science material than do seventh-grade readers.
-P-A-G-E-191
& 
| NATURE AND CONTENT OF READING MATERIALS 183 
He first classified the content of five seventh readers and five eighth 
readers into thirty-five types, using a fourth of a page as a unit.. These 
were later combined into nine classes, with the results shown in Table 
_ LVI (167: 238). This table shows a decrease in the percentage of content 
relating to “history” and to “American life” and a large increase in the - 
percentage of “pure literature.” These facts “emphasize the tendency in 
eighth-grade readers toward the traditional English work of our high 
schools.” In view of the fact that the need for greater emphasis on social- 
science material at the junior high school level is widely recognized, 
Herriott would have been justified in vigorously challenging the tendency 
which his study revealed.

Desirable and undesirable qualities of selections —Without doubt, the 
most critical and constructive study of the content of readers has been 
made by Uhl (389). ‘The first purpose of his study was to secure a list of - 
selections for each grade which had proved satisfactory and a correspond- 
ing list which had proved unsatisfactory. Accordingly, judgments were 
secured from more than three thousand teachers in Grades I to VIII, 
inclusive, concerning the value of several thousand selections. 
The second palltpose of Uhl’s study was to determine the desirable and 
undesirable qualities of selections. Uhl submitted to teachers in forty-nine 
cities a preferred list of selections, based on the judgments of three 
thousand teachers, together with directions for critical comments con- 
cerning their characteristic qualities. He asked the teachers (1) to choose 
fifteen selections “which you regard as being. the best ones for use in your 
grade,” (2) to rank them from one to fifteen in the order of merit, and (3) 
to write below each selection the “names of the qualities which you con- —
-P-A-G-E-192
= 
184 . INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
sider as uppermost in the selection.” The teachers were also requested 
to make a more detailed report on the selection which their pupils liked 
best and on the one which they disliked most. Uhl received reports from 
741 teachers. In order to check the teachers’ judgments, tests based on 
certain selections were given to 529 pupils in Grades III to VIII, inclusive. 
Measures of both interest and comprehension were secured. 
The important conclusions of Uhl’s study follow! (x) Much of the 
material in basal readers is unsatisfactory. Among the undesirable quali- 
ties are “overmaturity,” “too difficult,” “lack of action or plot,” “un- 
real,” “depressing,” “monotonous,” “not well told,” and “too long or 
scrappy.” (2) There are many selections in readers which meet with al- 
most universal approval. The relative importance of several desirable | 
qualities of selections is shown in Table XLVIII (page 169). (3) Differ- 
ences in the success of selections in different schools are due to variations 
in academic standards. Uhl’s records showed that if provision was made 
for comprehending the content of what was read, children of widely 
different population groups showed little or no difference in their interest 
in given selections. (4) Newer types*of informational material prove very 
successful and provide “content which has ample social justification.” 
The lesson which this fact teaches is that informational material must-be 
writyen for children rather than culled from adult literature. ° 
Summary statements.—The most important conclusions of the investi- 
gations to which reference has been made follow: (1) The religious ele- 
ment in readers which held a pre-eminent place in 1750 has practically 
disappeared. (2) The literary ideal seems to dominate most sets of readers 
today. (3) There are ‘noteworthy changes in the specific nature of the 
content from the lower grades to the upper grades. There are wide varia- 
tions, however, in the emphasis placed on different types of content at 
each level of advancement. (4) A very critical attitude toward the content 
of readers has developed, as illustrated in the study of the nature element 
in first-grade readers, the duplication of material in second-grade readers, 
and the disappearance of social-science content in eighth-grade readers. 
(5) Desirable and undesirable qualities of reading migterial are clearly 
distinguished as a result of Uhl’s study. The fact is also emphasized 
that informational material proves very interesting if appropriately 
written. 
Largely because of differences in methods of analyzing the content of 
readers, the results of these studies are not in complete agreement. For 
example, Hosic’s study suggested a much larger percentage of “pure liter- 
ature” than did Herriott’s study. These differences emphasize the need
-P-A-G-E-193
A 
NATURE AND CONTENT OF READING MATERIALS 185 
of specific studies of methods of investigation in this field. Furthermore, 
there is greater need at present of experimental studies to determine the 
characteristics of desirable and undesirable reading materials than of 
tabular studies of selections or types of content in current use. 
: STUDIES OF READING VOCABULARIES 
Word knowledge in elementary schools-—The most comprehensive study 
of reading vocabularies which has been reported was made by Thorndike 
(379) in the selection and organization of his famous “word list.” This 
list includes “10,000 words which are found to occur most widely in a 
count of about 625,000 words from literature for children; about 3,000,000 
words from the Bible and English classics; about 300,000 words from 
elementary-school textbooks; about 50,000 words from books about cook- 
ing, sewing, farming, the trades, and the like; about 90,000 words from 
the daily newspapers; and about 500,000 words from correspondence. 
Forty-one different sources were used” (379: ii). The range and fre- 
quency of each word’s occurrence are indicated by credit numbers. 
The following values of the word list were indicated by Thorndike 
(380}; It aids in establishing “standards for word knowledge, by grades, 
by or by mental ages”; it aids in the selection and gradation of 
" readers Zit. helps to determine the phonetic words and elements which 
occur most frequently; it suggests “a basic list of great value in teaching 
foreign adults to use English” 3it suggests amendments and extensions to 
spelling scalesPand it aids in determining the importance of each element 
of.a reading test. One limitation to the list as a basis for the vocabulary 
of beginning reading lessons is that it is derived from reading materials © 
appropriate for pupils who have made more or less progress in learning 
to read rather than from the spoken and meaning vocabularies of children 
who are just ready for formal instruction in reading. 
Vocabularies of primers:-—One of the early vocabulary studies was 
made by Jones (196), who determined the frequency of phonetic and sight 
words in “ten primers in common use.” The phonetic list included “all 
of those simple Engl words that belong to the 150 common phonetic 
families.” The sight list included ‘various irregular words that do not 
employ one of the common phonograms, and most words of two or more 
syllables.” The list of words has been used widely in testing the vocabu- 
lary knowledge of children. In this connection each word was assigned a 
value: A sight word was given the number which represented its fre- 
quency; a phonetic word was given a number which represented “the sum 
of the recurrences of all words of that phonic family in ten primers.” This
-P-A-G-E-194
186 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING. 
method of weighting has been justly criticized, since the frequency of occur- 
rence of a word is by no means an accurate measure of its difficulty. 
A much more elaborate vocabulary study was reported by Selke and 
Selke (336), who tabulated the frequencies of the words used in twelve 
beginning books in reading. A total of 1,636 different words was found. 
Several very significant facts were revealed by the study. First, beginning 
books differ widely in the number of different words which they contain. 
The range in the twelve books studied was from 157 to 630. Second, ‘a sur- 
prisingly large number of words have a very limited frequency.” For 
example, “four of the methods have 70 or more per cent ofthe total num- 
ber of words occurring less than ten times; four others, from 60 to 69 per 
cent; three, from 50. to 59 per cent; and but one, less than 50 per cent.” 
Third, only 38 of the 1,636 words were found in all twelve books. Seven 
hundred and eighty-three words, or more than half the total number, 
were found in only one book. Fourth, the total vocabulary of any two 
books is so extensive that the books can hardly be considered supplemen- 
tary. These findings suggest the need of studies to determine the most 
appropriate vocabulary for a beginning book in reading, the extent to 
which such a vocabulary should vary with different groups of children, 
and the effect on progress in reading if the vocabularies of supplementary 
books grow out of, and gradually expand, the vocabulary of the basic 
book. 
Vocabularies of ten first readers.—Packer (287) made a study of the 
vocabularies of ten first readers. According to his tabulation, there is a 
total of 3,541 different words in these books. This is more than twice the 
number of words that Selke and Selke found in twelve beginning readers. 
Of the total number of words listed, 2,048 occur four times or less; 2,562 
words occur less than ten times. The surprising fact brought out by this 
study is the wide range of vocabularies in the ten readers and the relative 
infrequency with which at least five-sevenths of the total number of words 
occur, - 
Vocabularies of ten second readers——Housh (181) counted the words, 
page by page, of ten second readers and determin the frequency of each 
word. The ten readers included 1,566 pages and a total of 143,789 words. 
The number of different words in a given reader varied from 1,198 to 
1,910. Four hundred and nineteen words were common to all ten readers. 
When the vocabularies of a so-called “method” reader and a “content” 
reader were compared, it was found that the number of common words 
was relatively small. In a number of such comparisons, the number of 
common words ranged from 655 to 928. In harmony with the findings of
-P-A-G-E-195

NATURE AND CONTENT OF READING MATERIALS » 87 
Packer in the case of first readers, there was a surprisingly large percent- 
age of the words used in each reader which occurred only one, two, or 
three times. If frequent repetition is essential to mastery, it is evident 
that pupils will pass from the primary grades more or less unfamiliar with 
many words which apparently should be learned at this level of advance- 
“ment. 
Mastery: vocabularies in primary reading.—The vocabulary studies 
which have been referred to thus far reveal a surprisingly large vocabulary 
in the readers for each grade. As a result, a demand has developed for 
a so-called “basic” vocabulary which should be mastered without fail in 
each grade. In order to provide for this need the teachers of Los Angeles 
(227) adopted a minimum vocabulary list of 807 words for pupils about 
to begin the second reader. It was based on the vocabularies of the Elson 
primer and first reader “with slight additions.” In commenting on this © 
list, Lane said, “If every child who begins his second reader has mastered 
this minimal list through experiencing the words in interesting content, 
he will have gone a long way toward proficiency in oral sight reading” 
(227: 64). It is evident, of course, that this list was adopted to meet the 
needs of Los Angeles pupils. , 
Mastery vocabularies for each of the primary grades have been pro- 
posed by Brown (43). Her study was based on the vocabularies of the 
Winston primer (321 words), first reader (612 words), second reader (1,49 5 
words), and third reader (2,768 words). The general procedure followed 
was to list the different words in each book of the series, to score their 
frequency in the primer and first reader, and to note the words which 
held over from volume to volume. In the case of the vocabulary of the 
second reader, the frequencies were not counted, but the list was checked 
with Housh’s list. The words which appeared on both lists were selected 
for mastery. In the case of the vocabulary of the third reader, words were 
selected for mastery on the basis of the judgment of local teachers. As a 
result of these steps, a mastery vocabulary of 680 words for the first three 
grades was selected. Of these, 408 are found in the first five hundred 
words of. the Thorndike word list, and all except twenty-one are found in 
the first ‘2,500 words of that list. The mastery vocabulary selected by 
Brown is published in six lists, one for each semester of the first three 
grades. One criticism of the list relates to the small number of words 
which it contains. Justification for this criticism is found in Gregory’s 
study of the reading vocabularies of third-grade children. . hea 
Required vocabulary of third-grade children.—Gregory (147) made a Z 
study of the reading vocabulary which was required in the third grade in
-P-A-G-E-196
183 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
order to meet the minimum requirements of the Oregon state course of 
study. A count was first made of the different words in the primers, read- 
ers, spellers, and arithmetic required in the first three grades. In the case 
of the New World spellers, only the “reading words” were included in the 
count. Table LVII (147: 129) gives the total number of words in each 
book and the number of new words. This table shows that the minimum 
reading vocabulary of third-grade pupils in Oregon is 5,190. “This number 
is made up of 4,977 words in the regular reading vocabulary and 213 addi- 
tional words that a child is called upon to spell, which would, of course, be 
in his reading vocabulary.”’ An examination of the column which contains 
the number of new words shows that the vocabulary burden in the second- 
and third-grade reading classes is very heavy. Furthermore, approximate-

ly 40 per cent of the words in the arithmetic are new and doubtless present 
more or Jess difficulty. The fact should also be noted that about two- 
sevenths of the spelling vocabulary does not appear in the regular reading 
vocabulary. 
In this study of the frequency of occurrence of these words, Gregory 
found that nearly 30 per cent appeared but once. He justly concluded 
that this may be “one of the important causes why some children read so 
poorly and fail to recognize these words when they meet them again in 
the upper grades.”” This study takes no account of the new words in such 
subjects as history, geography, or science. It is evident that “6,000 words 
would be a very conservative estimate for third-grade reading vocabula- 
ries.” For this reason, a minimum mastery list of 680 words for the first 
three grades, as recommended by Brown, seems quite inadequate.
-P-A-G-E-197
NATURE AND CONTENT OF READING MATERIALS 189 
Studies of the vocabularies of school subjects —The vocabulary problem 
in spelling and arithmetic in the primary grades was referred to in the 
discussion of Gregory’s study. Rankin (309) emphasizes the need of spe- 
cific attention to vocabulary-building in history. In order to determine 
the reading vocabulary required in that subject, he counted the words “in 
a popular and excellent modern textbook in United States history.” He 
found a total of 5,965 words, of which 909 were proper names. On the 
basis of this study and other information which he was able to secure, he 
estimated that “the eighth-grade student who completes his work success- 
fully must possess from ten to fifteen thousand words.” 
Pressey (304) reported the results of a study of the technical vocabu- 
laries in twenty-two elementary-school and high-school subjects. The 
method employed in the study was to read widely used textbooks, record- 
ing all words “which appeared technical or unusual.” The readings in 
each subject continued “until three successive readings added less than 1 
per cent of new words. The number of readings necessary to reach the 
saturation point’ varied from eight in chemistry to twenty-three in, 
history.” The number of words recorded varied from 297 in algebra to 
1,691 in general science. The words for each subject were then checked 
as to their importance in the subject. This was done, on the basis of 
personal judgment, by summer-school students, varying in number from 
27 in home economics to 103 in arithmetic.. The words were next classified 
into four groups as follows: essential vocabulary, that is, those words 
which were checked by at least half of those who examined the list; ac- 
cessory vocabulary, that is, those words which received from one-fourth 
to one-half of the possible number of checks; words appearing in three 
or more books but checked by less than one-fourth of the examiners; the 
remaining words, which were eliminated as unimportant. The final step . 
was to select the words common to a group of subjects, such as the math- 
ematics group, and to list them together. The words peculiar toa given 
subject of that group were listed separately. The lists, which are now 
available, should be of great value in calling to the attention of pupils 
and of teachers the technical words in each subject which will need more 
or less specific attention. 
In order to estimate the “vocabulary burden” of a textbook, Lively 
and Pressey (235) proceeded as follows: noted the number of pages in the 
book and the approximate number of words per line; estimated the num- 
ber of pages that should be sampled, one line to a page, in order to include 
a total of one thousand words; determined the pages from which lines 
were to be selected in order that the samples might be equally distributed
-P-A-G-E-198
190 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
throughout the book; counted the total number of words in the selected 
samples; determined the words not in the first ten thousand of the Thorn- 
dike word list and considered them as an index of the size of the technical 
vocabulary of the text; and determined the weighted median index num- 
ber of the words which appeared in the first ten thousand of the Thorn- 
dike word list. The limitations of this procedure and the reliability of 
such a sampling are discussed at some length by the authors. The pro- 
posed plan is a substitute for personal judgment; its reliability may be 
greatly improved as experimentation goes forward. The practical value 
of the suggestion is seriously limited because of the large amount of type 
required to score a textbook. 
Concluding statements.—The studies to which reference has been made 
show clearly that the reading materials assigned in both elementary-school 
and high-school classes include a surprisingly wide range of vocabulary. 
The minimum vocabularies adopted in the lower grades are very limited 
in comparison with the vocabularies of required reading materials. The 
vocabulary problem in content subjects appears in the primary grades 
and becomes increasingly prominent as pupils advance to the higher 
grades. Two problems which are in urgent need of careful study relate to 
the control of vocabulary difficulties in the organization of reading mate- 
rial for pupils at each level of advancement and the development of eco- 
nomical and effective methods of vocabulary mastery.

"HYGIENIC REQUIREMENTS OF PRINTED MATERIALS 
- \Purpase. It is the purpose of this chapter to summarize the results of 
investigations relating to hygienic requirements of printed matetialsf The 
essential facts will be organized and presented in terms of the following 
topics:, style of type; ; legibility of different letters of the alphabet; length 
line; regularity in length of line; distance between thé lines (leading); 
sizeof type; thickness of the vertical strokes of letters; spacing of words 
and lettérs and the space between the vertical strokes of letters; color of 
color and texture of paper; color of pictures; and-size of book. 
eto ~—When the art of printing from movable type was intro- 
. a very few styles of type were in use. Very shortly, however, de- 
‘signers and draftsmen began to devote a great deal of time to simplifying 
and improving the existing forms of lettersy As Roethlein has pointed out, 
“the ingenuity’ of many generations of medieval and modern designers 
has produced a multitude of variants of letter'forms. .... Hundreds of |,

correlation between legibility and these items. These findings make it 
clear that the effect of style of type on legibility can be determined accu- 
rately only when all other characteristics of printed letters are held 
constant. . 
A comparison of the results of the first and second experiments re- 
vealed several significant facts, First, “isolated letters are invariably read 
at a greater average distance than those letters which occur in groups.” 
Second, “the varying degrees of legibility tend to be reduced to a common 
level as a result of grouping.” For example, the legibility of the eight 
faces for which comparable data were secured varied from 236 to 191 
centimeters when presented singly and from 166 to 144 centimeters when 
presented in groups. Since grouping letters into non-serial syllables pro- 
duced marked changes in their legibility, one is justified in assuming that 
differences in legibility may be eliminated still further when letters are 
recognized in words or sentences. 
A second experiment dealing with the legibility of different faces of 
type was conducted by Cattell, whose findings have been summarized by 
Gilliland (119: 16-17). Cattell found “that large roman type.is more 
legible than large German type even for German readers and that the 
small German letters are more legible than the large ones.” 
A third experiment has been reported by Gilliland (x19: 159-76), who 
compared the relative legibility of handwriting, Old English type, and 
“ordinary type” as measured by the number, length, and position of the 
eye-fixations in reading. The most important conclusions follow: (1) 
‘There are more fixations for reading handwriting and Old English type 
than for reading ordinary type; on the average, there are one or two more 
fixations per line.” (2) ‘The reading is 17 per cent slower for handwriting 
and 35 per cent slower for Old English type than for re-reading the same 
material printed in ordinary Caslon type.” (3) “Such form changes as 
handwriting and Old English type tend to break up the regular motor 
habits of silent reading. Sometimes the principal changes are an excessive 
number of regressive movements #For many readers there is a reversion to 
the earlier reading methods by fixating upon the individual words, or some- 
times upon syllables, instead of reading by phrases or even short clauses.” 
' The experimental studies to which reference has been made justify 
the following conclusions: dh Legibility varies, to a greater or less extent, 
with style of type. ;The differences are much less when letters are present- 
ed in groups thah when letters are presented in isolation. (2) gPlain styles 
of type, such as roman and Caslon, are much more legible than the more 
ornate styles of type, such as Old English and German type; It remains

for experiments to determine the relative merits of different styles of plain 
type. In the meantime, those who desire to have printing done should be 
guided by the valuable experience of printers as summarized in such vol- 
umes as Updike’s Printing Types, DeVinne’s Plain Printing Types, and 
LeGrosse and Grant’s Typographical Printing Surfaces. (3) Handwritten 
and typewritten materials are less legible than material printed in plain 
type. Pit is advisable for teachers, particularly of the lower grades, to use 
well-printed material rather than mimeographed or hectographed mate- 
nal, The difference itrtegibility is not so great, however, as to make the 
latter prohibitive for use during short periods of time. ‘ . 
Legibility of different letters ——A great deal‘of scientific interest has 
been manifested in the relative legibility of different letters of the alpha- 
bet. Sanford (327) measured the relative legibility, in daylight illumina- 
tion, of letters 1.8 millimeters high printed in Snellen type. Three meas- 
ures of legibility. were secured: (1) the distance at which any letters could 
be read, (2) the distance at which all letters could be read; and (3) the time 
required to read each letter. Cattell, as reported by Gilliland (119: 17), 
used the fall chronoscope method. Dockeray (80: 124) exposed ten-point 
roman’ (Old Style) type in a Dodge mirror tachistoscope. Roethlein (321) 
measured the legibility of sixteen different styles of ten-point type by 
determining the distance from the eye at which the letters were recog- 
nized. Her results were summarized in terms of the average legibility for 
the sixteen styles of type. 
ults of these early investigations concerning the legibility of 
‘of the alphabet have been summarized by Shaw as follows: 
‘Thg-most legible letters were found to be w, m, g, p, »,7, and f. The letters 
k, b, «, 1, n, and u were claséed fair in comparison with the other letters 
as ihility, while the letters a, #, i, 2, 0, c, s, and € were pronounced poor as 
to legibility. Tt was discovered that the letters c, ¢, and o are often taken one 
: ther, ‘and accordingly are easily confusable, and that i tends to be 
4, a with s, 4 with b. The letters g and a are mistaken for several 
proves to be a hard letter to recognize [337: 171-72]. , : aa 
to the factors involved in legibility, Roethlein (321) con- 
y extensive investigations that thére“were six: “(z) the _- 
er, (2) the size of the letter, (3) the heaviness of the face’ “fee 
ie thickness of the lines which constitute the letter), (4) the 
hite margin which surrounds the letter, (s) the position of 
eTetter-group, (6) the shape and size of the adjacent letters” 
ccording to Roethlein’s findings, “the first factor seemed to 
dficant than any of the other five. ” .

194 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Studies of the legibility of different letters are of limited practical 
value. However, they enable teachers to understand some of the mistakes 
made by children in learning to read and to spell. It is also possible that 
such studies may, in the course of time, lead to desirable modifications irt 
the forms of letters that are easily confused. The limitations of such 
studies so far as the hygiene of reading is concerned lie in the fact that 
letters which are more or less illegible when presented in isolation are 
readily recognized when they are combined into words; also their rela- 
tive legibility varies with the groups of letters with which they are com- 
bined. © 
Eength of line,—The most appropriate length of line was studied 
extensively in Europe ‘several decades ago by such investigators as Javal, 
Cohn, and Weber. There was general agreement among them that Jong 
lines are injurious because of the fatigue which results from reading them. 
Expériments carried oti‘by Dearborn (77: 99-115) led him to concludé 
that “a line of from 75 to 85 mm. or about a third longer than the ordinary 
newspaper line of the New York dailies with type 1.5 mm. in height com- 
bines a good many advantages” (77: 115). After summarizing the results 
of previous investigations, including those of Dearborn, Huey (185: 409- 
12) concluded that “we are certainly safe in putting 90 millimeters as a 
maximum, with a preference for lines of 60 to 80 millimeters” (185: 412). 
Much evidence and various arguments have been presented against 
the use of longer lines. Huey refers to the fact that Javal “names as one 
of the principal causes of fatigue in reading, and a cause tending to 
produce and aggravate myopia, the considerable amount of asymmetricay’ 
accommodation required as the eye moves along a long line, the amount 
increasing always with the length of the line” (185: 409). It is evident 
that unless constant adjustments are made by the head or by the hand 
holding the book, one eye is always farther from the reading matter than 
the other, except at the mid-point. If follows that the longer the line, the 
greater the strain of accommodation, Furthermore, Huey maintains that 
“the difficulty and distraction” incident to the return sweep from the end 
of one line to the beginning of the next is increasingly ‘large as the lines 
become longer. Finally, he argues that long lines require a greater extent 
of eye-movement for a given amount of material than do short lines. / 
is due to the fact that the eye does not travel the entire length of the line 
in reading but begins some distance within. ‘“The amount of this indenta- 
tion tends to be a constant amount somewhat irrespective of the line’s 
length, and is consequently a larger proportion of the line’s length in the 
shorter lines” (185: 410).
-P-A-G-E-203
HYGIENIC REQUIREMENTS OF PRINTED MATERIALS — 195 
Dearborn (77) and other investigators found relatively more fixations . 
per line in reading shorter lines, but they were shorter in duration. He 
ytilized these facts in the following argument in favor of short lines: 
To summarize, the fixation pauses are uniformly longer at the beginning ~ 
and at certain other parts of the line. The reason assigned for this peculiarity 
is that at these places a more general perception is secured of the ideas and words 
: . that follow in the line. The succeeding fixations serve to amplify and fill out 
* this general perception. Finally, this expanding of the field of attention is made 
more frequently and with greater ease in the short lines [77: 122]. 
In a study of the “length of line as related to readability in the first 
four grades,” Blackhurst (28) determined the rate and number of errors

” # Rearranged from author’s data, 
when reading lines of different lengths. In summarizing the data secured 
for the different grades, he stated that “we find that they corroborate each 
‘other i cing the most desired length at from go to 103 millimeters, 
with evidence that the latter is more nearly the desired length.” ‘These 
conclusiops differ noticeably from those of Dearborn and Hey. Inas- 
much as lackhurst has used only one measure of efficiency and has not 
refiited the arguments presented by Huey and Dearborn, we should await 
further evidence before drawing final conclusions concerning the most ' 
desifable length of line. 
A very interesting summary of the tendency during the last forty 
for more with regard to the length of the lines in school readers is 
presented i in Table LVIII (25: 407-8). This table reveals a distinct tend- 
ency toward the use of longer lines in each grade. {iti is evident at once that 
actual practice conforms much more closely to Blackhurst’s recommenda-'

196 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
tions than to those of Huey and Dearborn. As has already been suggested, 
additional evidence is necessary before standards can be adopted with 
full assurance of their validity. 
Regularity in length of line-~Dearborn demonstrated the fact “that 
the difficulties of accurate fixation may be increased even for the practiced 
adult reader - by-necessitating tog frequent change of the arc of movement”’ 
(77: 38). He concluded that “fniformity in the length of line is doubtless, 
therefore, even more a desideratuy for beginners in reading.” Huey 
agrees with Dearborn’s conclusion and supports it by the statemént that 
“the reader drops quickly into a habit of making a constant number of 
movements and pauses per line, for a given passage, and broken lines 
confuse and prevent the formation of such temporary habits” (185: 412). 
The tendency with regard to regularity of margins in first-grade read- 
ers published during the last forty years was studied by Blackhurst. A

summary of his findings is shown in Table LIX (25: 408). This table 
shows that “there was a tendency from 1890 to 1910 to make the left 
margin regular, leaving the right irregular. From 1910 to the present 
time, however, the tendency has been to make both margins irregular. ” 
The recent tendency is not in harmony with the recommendations of 
Dearborn and Huey. The argument which has been advanced in favor of 
jrregular margins, particularly tl right, is that words may be printed 
more effectively in thought units. \There is no evidence in the recent sci- . 
entific studies of reading to justify the assumption that the advantages 
gained by printing words in thought units are greater than are the dis- 
sfgvantages of irregular margins. 
Distance between the lines—Early experimenters were divided i in their 
views concerning the advisability of wide leading. After reviewing the 
available evidence, Huey (185: 408-9) concluded that some leading should 
be required, “but hardly more than Cohn’s minimum of 2.5 millimeters,” 
He also maintained that leading is doubtless a mistake when the size of
-P-A-G-E-205
  . N\ 
HYGIENIC REQUIREMENTS OF PRINTED MATERIALS 197 
the type is below a height of 1.5 millimeters for small letters. ‘The size 
of type should by all means be increased-instead, as this is by far the most 
important of the factors conditioning fatigue.” Shaw (337: 177-78), on 
the other hand, recommends much wider leading for all the lower-grades. 
For example, be favors for the first grade a width of leading 4.5 milli- 
meters (height 2.6 mm.); for the second and third grades, 4.0 millimeters 
(height 2 mm.); and for the fourth grade, 3.6 millimeters (height 1.8 mm.). 
Blackhurst (27) made a study of the width of leading as related to 
readability in the first four grades by determining the rate of reading and 
the number of errors made in reading passages with three different widths 
of leading (.5o mm., 1.80 mm., and 3.80 mm.), other factors being kept 
‘constant. His records led to the conclusion that a minimum of 3.8 milli- 
meters was desirable in the beginning of the first grade, that this could be 
reduced gradually to 1.33 millimeters by the beginning of the second 
grade, and that 1.0 millimeters of leading is sufficient above the second 
grade. Blackhurst’s findings are of limited value owing to the fact that 
only three widths of leading were included in his experiment. Further- 
more, no statement is made concerning the height of the small letters. 
Taken at their face value, however, his findings agree more closely with 
Huey’s recommendations than with Dearborn’s, except for the first grade. 
Bentley (21) reports the results of a study which shows that in reading 
twelve-point type the leading that produced the most rapid reading was 
seven seventy-seconds of an inch, or about 2.5 millimeters. With smaller 
type, the same relative leading was found to be most effective. It seems, 
therefore, that there is a definite relation between the size of the type and 
the spacing between the lines. Unfortunately, Bentley’s investigation did 
not continue far enough to verify this tentative conclusion and to deter- 
mine the most effective leading for type other than twelve point. 
The tendency in practice diuring the last forty years is revealed in 
Table LX (25: 408), which is based on a study of the\width of leading in 
readers. This table shows thdt gfe distance between the lines has in- 
creased steadily during the period represented. Present practice is not in 
close accord with the recommendations of Huey, Shaw, or Blackhurst, as 
presented in the preceding paragraphs. If, as Bentley maintains, there is 
a definite relation between size of type and width of leading, it is im- 
portant that detailed studies be made to determine the most appropriate 
leading for each size of type. 
"LStze of type.—The fact is generally recognized that the size of type is 
one ofthe ‘most important factors determining legibility. Griffing and 
Franz (249) found that fatigue increased rapidly as the size of type ‘de- - . My \ .

creased. “No type less than 1.5 mm. in height—eleven point—-should be 
used, the fatigue increasing rapidly even before the size becomes as small 
as this.” 
Various experts, summarizing the results of earlier investigators, have 
prepared recommendations concerning appropriate sizes of type. Three 
such sets of recommendations are included at this point. They will be 
referred to later in making comparisons with the results of more recent 
investigations. Shaw (337: 177-78) recommends the following heights 
(and leadings) for the first four grades: first grade, 2.6 mm. (width of 
leading, 4.5 mm.); second and third grades, 2 mm. (width of leading, 
4.0 mm.); fourth grade, 1.8 mm. (width of leading, 3.6 mm.). Huey’s

recommendations (185: 416-17) agree very closely with those of 
Shaw. He thinks that they are “none too stringent,” except that the 
leading could well be sacrificed for larger type, particularly for the third 
and fourth grades. Berkowitz (22: 59) presents the following committee 
recommendations published by the British"Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science in 1913: under seven years of age, 3.5 mm.; seven to 
eight, 2.5 mm.; eight to nine, 2.0 mm.; nine to twelve, 1.8 mm.; over 
twelve, 1.58 mm. It is evident that the British committee favored the 
use of relatively large type for the first four grades. 
Two experiments have been reported recently concerning the relation 
of size of type to efficiency in adult reading. In an analytical study of 
eye-movement records Judd (204: 53) found that “the unit of recogni- 
tion is very little affected by changes in the sensory content.” Onl§ slight 
differences were noted when the size of eleven-point type was doubled or

reduced one-half. In a somewhat more elaborate nud Gitta 020) 
used two sets of paragraphs, the one varying in size from six to fifty-four 
points and the other from three to ninety points. The length of the lines 
varied from 12 to 15 inches. ‘Each paragraph in both sets was accom- 
panied by a paragraph of identical content printed in 12 point type with 
a 3% inch line.” More than twenty adults read both sets of paragraphs. 
Their rates of reading were determined, and their eye-movements were 
photographed. The records led Gilliland to the conclusion that “the read- 
ing of the average adult is not greatly affected by changes in the size of 
type between the limits of 36 point and 6 point type.” The records show, 
however, that there is a slight reduction in speed in reading type larger 
than eighteen point. The lesson which these facts teach is that in the case 
of mature readers rate of reading and eye-movement habits are little 
affected when the type is varied in size within fairly wide limits. There 
is need, however, of studies to ‘determine the effect of such changes on 
fatigue in reading. 
Two studies of the relation of size of type to the efficiency of children’s 
reading have been reported recently. Blackhurst measured the rate and 
accuracy of the reading of pupils in the first four grades when types of 
various sizes were used. His findings are summarized in Table LXI (26: 
698-99) in terms of the number of seconds required for reading and the 
number of errors made. The data presented in the table led to the con- 
clusion that, of the sizes of type investigated, eighteen-point type is the 
most readable in the third and fourth grades and twenty-four point type 
is the most readable in the first and second grades. These conclusions 
agree more nearly with the recommendations of the British committee 
than with those of Huey and Shaw. 
(aa (x19) reports a study of the effect of the size of type on the 
ra ading of children. His evidence is not conchisive, owing to the 
fact that the passage read by the third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade pupils 
was so difficult that it very greatly reduced their speed of. reading, thus - 
_ obscuring evidence of deficiencies which might have’ been due to changes in size of type. He ventures the statement, however, that “negative 
_ evidence indicates that there is no justification for the present style of” printing primers and first readers in very large type.” If we assume for 
the moment that young children read smaller type as rapidly and as accu- 
rately as they read larger type, it remains to prove that the use of smaller 
type does not result in more eyestrain or fatigue in reading. . 
, \@he tendency in practice during the last forty years with regard to 
size of type is shown in Table LXII (25: 407). This table shows that “in 
f ef  
-P-A-G-E-208
200 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
general there was an increase in the size of type . . . . between the years 
1890 and 1900.” Since the latter date there has been very little change 
of any significance. Current practice corresponds very closely with the 
recommendations of Huey and Shaw and has doubtless been influenced 
very largely by them. It is not in accord with the recommendations of 
thé British committee or the findings of Blackhurst, both of which indi- 
cate that larger type should be used. ,

There is need of detailed scientific studies of the effect of changes in 
the size of type on speed and accuracy of reading, on the character of the 
eye-movements, and on fatigue in reading. The increasing number of eye- 
defects among school children and the fact that we are requiring more and 
more reading in the grades make it almost imperative to determine 
whether sizes of type larger than those used most widely in the various 
grades are desirable both for pupils with normal vision and for pupils 
with defective vision. 
Thickness of vertical strokes—There is general agreement that letters 
should stand out clearly ahd distinctly. The thickness of the vertical
-P-A-G-E-209

stroke “should be not less than .25 millimeter, according co Capper 
ably .3 millimeter, according to Sack. This thickness of thé letters has 
been found by Jéval and others to be a very important factor in increasing 
legibility and in decreasing fatigue” (185: 407). Roethlein (321: 34) 
concluded:from her investigations that the heavy-face type proved to be 
more legible than the light-face type. “The optimal heaviness of face 
‘seems to lie in a mean between the bold faces and such light faces as 
Scotch Roman and Cushing Monotone.” Supplementary studies to de- 
termine the most effective thickness of letters of different sizes with 
different widths of leading and with various spacings between letters are 
desirable. ~ .

Xx, Spatm—Very little information is available concerning the best spac- 
ing of words and letters and the most desirable space between the vertical 
Zot letters, Huey (185: 407-8) summarizes the work of previous 
ors somewhat as follows: A distance of two millimeters between 
words is generally approved; a minimum of six or séven letters per centi- 
meter is a convenient approximate gauge; the vertical strokes within a 
letter siéuld be from .3 to .5 millimeter apart; the vertical strokes of. 
adjacent letters should be from .50 to .75 millimeter apart. The early in- 
vestigations to which Huey had access should be supplemented by a series 
of studies to determine the optimal spacings when letters of different sizes _ 
and styles of type are used. The effect of changes in the spacing should bet 
measured i in ‘terms of fatigue in reading as well as in terms of speed and 
accuracy... 
-- \Coler-of type—Huey (185: 414) and Burnham (go: 5x) agree that 
‘printed tders should ‘be “deep black.” :

202 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
Color and texture of paper-—Most authorities agree that “the paper 
should be pure white, without gloss, the latter being especially injurious 
to the eyes” (185: 414). Starch (353: 263-64) reports a study made “to 
determine the relative effect upon the eye of reading from papers of 
various amounts of gloss and of various degrees of perfection of the inked 
impressions. Four kinds of papers were compared: a matte white paper, 
a pink newsprint paper, a blue newsprint paper, and a very glossy white 
paper. As measured by the Ingersoll glarimeter, these papers had the 
following glare or gloss values respectively, 18.5 per cent, 41.5 per cent, 
42.0 per cent, 73.5 per cent.” Three measures.of the chan; changes in the eyes 
produced by reading were used: the number of lines read in fifteen min- 
utes, the number of spontaneous winks per minute while reading, and loss 
of visual acuity in inches. The results showed “that glare is the decisive 
factor in diminishing ocular efficiency. The two white papers are respec- 
tively the best and the worst of the set. The two colored papers which are 
intermediate in glare are also found intermediate in ocular efficiency. 
These tesults suggest that color as such has little or no influence one way 
or the other.” Before this conclusion can be accepted, the effect of con- 
stant percentages of glare with various colors of papers should be deter- 
mined. 
__ The paper should be of such a quality that the printing on one side 
paper should have a minimum thickness of .075 millimetrs” (8g: 4 414). 
Furthermore, the printing on one side should be so done that the evenness 
of the surface on the other side will not be affected. , 
Color of pictures.—Dearborn (77: 38) thinks that the use of highly 
colored pictures and drawings i is questionabley since experiments indicate 
that peripheral color stimuli may affect the accuracy of fixations‘and eye- 
movements. He recognizes that these objections may be overbalanced 
by the advantages of highly colored pictures in securing interest and atten- 
tion. He believes, however, that the objectionable features should be min- 
imized. / 
Size of book.—Small books which can be easily held in the hand are 
preferred. ‘The larger books usually have to lie on a support which ex- 
poses the letters at an angle, greatly lessening their legibility and produc- 
ing the equivalent of a material decrease in size of type” (185: 412). 
Summary.—The investigations to which reference has been made lead 
to the following tentative conclusions concerning the hygienic require- 
ments of printed material: For purposes of legibility, reading material 
should be printed in black on white flossless paper in a plain style of type.

for different sizes of type have not been determined.(‘The size of type is 
very important. Until additional evidence has been. secured, the recom- 
mendations of Shaw and Huey should probably be followed. The vertical 
strokes of-tettérs should-be-thick enough to stand out clearly and dis- 
tinctly. With regard to spacing and other items not jncluded in this sum- 
mary, the recommendations of expert printers should be followed. 
The need of scientific studies has been emphasized in the discussion 
of practically every topic in this chapter. There is also urgent need for 
the development of accurate methods of measuring eyestrain or fatigue 
in reading. Because of the large number of eye-defects among school 
children, it is very important that debatable issues be studied in detail 
\ with respect to both normal and abnormal vision.

CHAPTER XVI 
DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL INSTRUCTION 
Importance of diagnostic and remedial work.—Records of achievement 
and school progress show that thousands of boys and girls fail each year 
to make normal progress in redding. A surprisingly large number of these 
pupils are retarded from three to five years. Not infrequently pupils are 
found who have made no progress in learning to read. It is evident that 
ordinary classroom procedure fails to provide these pupils with the help 
which they need. On the other hand, diagnostic and remedial studies 
which have been made of such cases demonstrate clearly that a very 
large percentage of these pupils can be materially helped. It follows that 
one of the major responsibilities which schools must assume relates to the 
study of the needs of individual pupils and to the provision of appropriate 
instruction. 
Brief survey of available literature—The interest in diagnostic and 
remedial work in reading has grown so rapidly during recent years that a 
large amount of suggestive literature is now available. Unfortunately, 
space will not permit a comprehensive summary of this material. An 
effort will be made, however, to indicate the types of discussion which are 
available. . 
Articles by Gray (139, 141), Horn (178), Merton (261), Uhl (388), and 
Zirbes (435) emphasize the importance of diagnostic and remedial work, 
describe types of cases, suggest causes of difficulties in reading, and offer 
practical suggestions concerning remedial instruction. 
Articles by Anderson and Merton (5, 6), Geiger (109), and Zirbes 
(435) describe case studies made under school conditions and offer practi- 
cal suggestions concerning methods of carrying on such work. 
Summaries of previous studies are presented by Bronner (40), Gray 
(142), and Hollingworth (172). There is need of a comprehensive sum- 
mary of various types of case studies. 
Detailed reports of systematic studies of various types of cases have 
been made by Gray (139) and McLaughlin (247) for pupils in practically 
all the elementary-school grades and by Woolley and Ferris (430) for 
pupils in the primary grades. The monographs by Gray and by Woolley 
and Ferris are probably the most complete sources of information in this 
field at present.

DIAGNOSIS AND’ REMEDIAL INSTRUCTION 205 
     The achievements and needs of subnormal children in reading have 
been discussed at length by Wallin (404). Miller (262) has described the 
diagnostic and remedial steps taken in the case of four subnormal children. 
Remer (315) has compared the needs and progress of an older border-line 
case and a normal child of the same mental age. 
Cases of congenital word-blindness, or inability to learn to tead, have 
been discussed at length by Hinshelwood (171) and more briefly by Judd 
(204), Schmitt (331), and Wallin (403). 
Articles by Fernald and Keller (91, 210) emphasize the value of 
kinaesthetic factors in the development of word recognition in the case 
of non-readers, 
Van Alstyne (394) has reported studies of ten gifted children whose © 
school progress was unsatisfactory. Such studies emphasize the fact that 
there are factors other than intelligence which determine success or failure 
in reading. 
Very interesting detailed reports of special cases have been made by 
Freeman (99), Gray (138), Holsopple (174), Ide (189), Leaming (230), 
Leland (231, 232, 233), Parker (289), Stillman (355), Towan (385), and 
Witmer (424). These studies attribute failure to a variety of causes, such 
as feeble-mindedness, aphasia, “the feminine absolute,” poor retentive- 
ness, deficient energy, and infantile stammer. 
A bulletin and an article by Sutherland (362, 363) describe the plans 
adopted in Los Angeles for correcting school disabilities in reading, Bulle- 
tins issued by the Board of Education of Tulsa, Oklahoma (387), and by 
the State Department of Education of Maryland (253) outline remedial 
types of instruction for classroom use. 
Technique of diagnosing individual cases—No standard technique has 
been worked out for diagnosing individual cases, Anderson and Merton 
(5, 6) wsed informal and standard reading tests and such information as 
they could secure from class records and teachers. Sutherland (363) re- ° 
ported the use of a series of thirteen tests, largely tests of reading, in order 
- to determine the types of help pupils needed. Gray (142) made use of 
“three general steps, namely, a study of the child’s physical and pedagogi- 
cal history, a preliminary diagnosis of reading accomplishment by means 
of standardized reading tests, and a more detailed analysis of reading 
difficulties ‘through the use of informal tests. Woolley and Ferris (430) 
made use of a battery of mental tests, four standardized educational tests, 
and supplementary information about the home and family of the pupil. 
Van Alstyne (394) reported the following sources of information: case 
history, teacher’s reports, teacher’s marks, pupil’s permanent record card, 
visiting teacher's report, the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Test, 
the Pintner-Patterson performance tests, the Healy-Bronner learning
-P-A-G-E-214
206 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
tests (A, B, C, D), a long-period learning test, the Pintner non-language 
and educational tests, and the Woodworth-Mathews “Emotional Insta- 
bility” test. 
The studies to which reference has been made show that very helpful 
diagnoses are possible through the use of educational tests and the type 
of information which can be secured in each classroom. On the other 
hand, a thorough diagnosis may require the use of an elaborate technique. 
There is need at present of investigations to determine the various types 
of information which are usually required in diagnosing individual cases 
and to perfect simple tests which may be used effectively either in the 
classroom or in the laboratory. , 
Types of remedial cases in reading —The problem of classifying reme- 
dial cases in reading is seriously complicated by the fact that there are 
few, if any, cases exactly alike. This is well illustrated by the following 
descriptive titles of cases reported by Anderson and Merton (5): “The 
Fluent Oral Reader Who Comprehends Nothing Read Silently;” “A 
Second-Grade Child Who Cannot Read Primer Material,” “A Child Who 
Repeats in Oral Reading,” “The Foreign Child Who Is Handicapped in 
His Third-Grade Reading Because of Meager Vocabulary,” and “A Sixth- 
Grade Boy Who Cannot Read Primer Material Fluently.” Additional 
types of remedial cases have been reported by other investigators. The 
wide variety of types is due to the fact that reading is a very complex 
process and that numerous attitudes, habits, and skills are involved. 
Consequently, there are innumerable variations in the kind and degree of 
difficulty encountered by pupils. 
An effort to classify remedial cases on the basis of reading difficulties 
was made in a detailed study of twenty-one pupils. After elaborate diag- 
nostic studies had been made, the twenty-one pupils were classified into 
the following general groups for purposes of comparison and discussion: 
“(z) pupils who made little or no progress in learning to read, (2) pupils 
who had encountered serious difficulties in interpretation, (3) pupils who 
had encountered difficulties primarily in the mechanics of reading, (4) pu- 
pils who had encountered difficulties in rate of silent reading, and (5) 
pupils who had made progress in learning to read but who were weak in 
practically all phases of reading” (142: 37). 
Although the pupils of each of these five classes possessed several com- 
mon characteristics, they differed widely with respect to the specific 
nature of their difficulties. For example, the following facts were reported 
concerning four pupils who were weak in the interpretation of what they 
read. It is evident that the needs of these pupils differed materially.
-P-A-G-E-215
DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL INSTRUCTION 207 
E. G., who had mastered the mechanics of reading, had not established the 
habit of directing attention to the content of what she read or of thinking inde- 
pendently about it. M. T. was inaccurate and erratic in interpretation, supply- 
ing ideas which were not found in the passages. J. P. interpreted simple interest- 
ing selections effectively but failed to interpret passages of a factual or problem- 
atic type. M. G. was an unusual case who failed in interpretation because of 
limited mental capacity and general immaturity [142: 62]. 
The classification of remedial cases into general types is valuable be- 
cause it enables the teacher or remedial worker to recognize and distin- 
guish more clearly the significant facts concerning a given case. There is 
need of investigations which aim to develop a more complete and precise 
classification for use in the study of remedial cases.‘ The fact should be 
remembered, however, that a knowledge of individual characteristics and 
needs is far more valuable than a knowledge of the general class or type 
which a pupil belongs. 
“ Causes of difficulty —A very suggestive classification of causes of diff- 
culty was used by Woolley and Ferris in their study of children in the 
primary grades. The dominant causes were grouped-under the following 
~ headings: (x) “children who were neglected,” that is, who had been ab- 
| sent, lived in distracting environments, or had moved about; (2) “those © 
| | who were high-grade defectives, though their intelligence quotients were 
still above the usually accepted limits for defect”; (3) “those with special 
defects which seemed to make the acquisition of a given type of knowledge 
unusually difficult”; and (4) “the psychopathic,” who frequently show 
flashes of genius but “fail to learn normally and remain erratic” (430: 
8-0), . A more detailed list of causes has been reported-in a summary of 
previous studies (142). They are inferior learning capacity, congenital 
word-blindness, poor auditory memory, defective vision, narrow span of 
recognition, ineffective eye-movements, inadequate training in phonetics, 
inadequate attention to the content, inadequate speaking vocabulary, 
small meaning vocabulary, speech defects, lack of interest, guessing, and 
timidity. These are merely examples of the wide variety of causes of 
serious difficulty in reading. There is need of exhaustive studies of reme- 
dial cases to determine more accurately the variety and ‘frequency of - 
specific causes of difficulty. Detailed information of this type will be very 
valuable in familiarizing teachers and remedial workers with possible ex- 
planations. However, it can never take the place of the intensive-study 
which is necessary in finding the dominant cause or causes of difficulty in 
each case under investigation,
-P-A-G-E-216
208 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
A variety of methods used in remedial work.—An analysis of the pro- 
cedures adopted in remedial instruction reveals two tendencies. The first 
is toward the use of a specific device in all cases belonging to the same 
general class. For example, Schmitt (331) made excellent use of phonetics 
in the case of pupils who encountered unusual difficulty in learning to 
read, Fernald and Keller (gz) used with success the method of tracing 
and writing words in teaching word recognition to non-readers, Hinshel- 
wood (171) reported good results through the use of the alphabet method 
in cases of word-blindness. Hollingworth justly pointed out that other 
methods might have been used in each of these studies. “Tt is not credible 
that all the non-readers found by Schmitt in Chicago chanced to have a 
kind of disability approachable by phonics, and in no other way; that 
those discovered by Fernald and Keller in California were so constituted 
that they could be approached through motor exercises, and not other- 
wise. .... In fact, no investigator has established his or her method as 
the only method of successful approach to particular cases by excluding 
other methods through experimental teaching” (172: 90). 
The second tendency is to vary the methods employed in order to’ 
make the strongest appeal to the particular pupil who is being taught. 
*his procedure is illustrated in the work of Gray (142) and Anderson and 
ferton (5). There is no evidence at present as to which of these tend- 
ncies should prevail. There is need of a series of carefully controlled ex- 
periments to determine the best methods of overcoming specific difficulties 
or a series of methods which are valuable in each important type of case, 
In the meantime, it will be necessary for teachers to make use of methods 
which have proved successful in class work, adapting them, of course, to 
the needs of individual pupils. 
Concluding statements —The importance and need of diagnostic and 
remedial work are widely recognized. The possibility of doing effective 
work of this type in the public schools has been clearly demonstrated by 
the studies of Anderson and Merton, Sutherland, and Zirbes. The need. 
of detailed investigations ,with regard to the technique‘ of diagnosis and 
types of remedial measures has been discussed. There is also need of two 
additional types of studies. The first relates to needed changes in regular” 
classroom instruction in order to reduce remedial cases to a minimum. 
The second relates to the provision of appropriate materials to make diag- 
nostic and remedial work an integral part of the work of each elementary 
school and high school.

CHAPTER XVII 
READING TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 
Problems for discussion.—Bulletin No. 55 of the Bureau of Education 
for 1923 contains references to hundreds of studies concerning the charac- 
teristics and uses of reading tests. An adequate summary of this material 
would fill an entire volume. On account of the limitations of space, only 
four topics will be discussed, namely, the importance of reading tests, the 
divergent views of reading represented by the tests, the phases of reading 
measured, and the need for a systematic reorganization of reading tests. 
' IMPORTANCE OF READING TESTS 
Evidence of the value of reading tests-—The fact was emphasized in 
chapter ii that the rapid development of standardized reading tests be- 
tween 1910 and rgz5 greatly increased the number and variety of scientific 
studies in the field of reading. The varied uses which have been made of 
tests and measurements in the study of important reading problems are 
revealed in the various chapters of this monograph. The literature on 
school surveys supplies evidence of the value of tests in measuring the 
results of reading instruction in city or state schopl systems. The fact 
that forty different reading tests and scales are now on sale in various sec- 
tions of the country shows that such tests have commanded a great deal 
of scientific interest. The surprisingly large number of reading tests pur- 
chased each year, over two million during 1924 in the case of one test, bears 
silent testimony of their wide use. A detailed study of these facts shows 
conclusively that objective tests of reading are essential both to successful 
school practice and to the scientific study of reading problems. 
THE DIVERGENT VIEWS OF READING REPRESENTED BY THE TESTS 
Two explanations for divergent views of reading.—One of the striking 
facts about reading tests is that they include all kinds of exercises which 
make use of printed words. This is due in part to the fact that the makers 
of tests define reading in radically different terms. For example, Otis (286) 
maintains that reading “must be considered.as embodying in essence only 
those mental processes which are concerned directly with the specific 
visual symbols as such, Other mental activities involved in the total read- 
ing complex may be spoken of as ‘supra-reading’ or the ‘accompaniments 
209
-P-A-G-E-218
210 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO READING 
of reading per se.’ ””? The following definition of reading ability by Courtis 
reveals a distinctly different point of view: “A child should be judged able 
to read a given sentence or paragraph if, within the standard time and 
in the standard subject-matter for his grade, he is so able to recognize the 
meaning of the separate words and of the passage as a whole that he 
comprehends the essential elements in their essential relations” (7o: 17). 
The tests prepared by Otis and Courtis differ in content and purpose as 
radically as do their definitions of reading. 
A second explanation for the great variety of reading tests is that 
test-makers have consciously endeavored to measure different phases or 
types of reading. For example, Kelly organized a reading test to measure 
“ability to get meaning from the printed page.” In defense of the complex 
type of test which he organized, he said, “While it is realized that it would 
be advantageous to test separately the several elements which compose 
this complex ability to interpret the printed page, it seemed worth while 
to prepare a measure with which to determine how children compare in 
this complex ability” (212: 27). Burgess, on the other hand, severely crit- 
icized such tests as Kelly’s on the ground that they measure abilities in 
addition to reading, such as the ability “to reason correctly, to infer, to 
remember, to do arithmetic, to solve puzzles, .. . . all of which are found 
in conjunction with the reading process, but none of which can properly 
be called the ability to read” (48: 23). In harmony with her views, Bur- 
gess prepared a test which measures a specific type of reading ability and 
which, in her judgment, is free from these criticisms, 
The discussion thus far should make it clear that current tests repre- 
sent widely different views of reading and that they measure different 
types or phases of reading ability. These facts are illustrated more fully 
in the following descriptive outline of reading tests. 
PHASES OF READING MEASURED 
Descriptive outline of reading tests —An effort has been made to include 
each type of reading test rather than to catalogue all tests. Vocabulary 
tests and tests in the field of poetry have been included because they are 
frequently referred to as reading tests. Critical comments have been made 
with regard to some of the tests in order to emphasize certain of their 
characteristics or to point out similarities or differences. 
ACCURACY OF WORD RECOGNITION 
The recognition and pronunciation of words——Ability to recognize and 
pronounce words either in isolation or in context is measured by the Jones 
Scale for Teaching and Testing Elementary Reading (196). The same test
-P-A-G-E-219

was improved and refined by Haggerty (152) for measuring ability to 
recognize and pronounce isolated words only. 
The recognition of words presented with non-sense syllables. —The Pres- 
sey and Skeel Group Test for Measuring Reading Vocabulary in the First 
Grade (306) requires pupils to recognize the one word in each of several 
lines of non-sense syllables. 
The recognition of the meanings of words.—The Detroit Group Test in 
Word Recognition (283) requires the child to draw a line from a word to 
the picture that represents its meaning. The Haggerty (153) and the 
Thorndike (375) visual vocabulary scales determine whether pupils are 
able to indicate the meanings of words seen. 
RATE AND ACCURACY OF ORAL READING 
Rate and accuracy.—The Standardized Oral Reading Paragraphs (131) 
measure rate and accuracy of oral reading by means of a series of short 
paragraphs arranged in the order of increasing difficulty. The Practical 
Oral Reading Tests, by E. D. Price, make use of a separate selection for 
each grade. The Oral Reading Check Tests by William S. Gray include 
four sets of passages. Each set was prepared for different grades. 
RATE OF SILENT READING 
Reading for a designated period of time—The Brown Silent Reading 
Test (42) determines the amount read in one minute; the Starch Silent 
Reading Tests (350) determine the amount read in. thirty seconds; and 
the Fordyce Scale for Measuring Achievements in Reading (96) measures 
the amount read in designated periods of time for the various grades. 
Reading for several short periods of time—The Courtis Silent Reading 
Test No. 2 (70) requires the pupil to read for six periods of thirty seconds 
each. The average number of words read a minute is adopted as the rate 
score, 
Reading a designated amount of material—The Gray Silent Reading 
Tests (131) measure rate of reading by the amount of time required to 
read one hundred or two hundred tvords, depending on the grade in which 
the test is given. 
. Rate measured indirectly. —A number of reading tests are called speed 
tests, although they do not measure the rate of reading directly. For ex- 
ample, the Burgess Scale for Measuring Ability in Silent Reading (48) 
determines the number of passages read and interpreted accurately in 
five minutes. The Pressey Diagnostic Tests in Silent Reading (speed) 
(302) determine the number of sentences a pupil can read accurately i in 
three minutes, crossing out the one word in each sentence which does not
-P-A-G-E-220

belong there. The Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Tests (264) use 
an index of rate derived by adding together the rate scores for the 
various sections of the test completed in five minutes. It is evident that 
the rate of continuous reading is not measured by any of these tests. 
COMPREHENSION IN SILENT READING 
Each test of comprehension is characterized by the specific device 
used to indicate grasp of meaning. 
Deleting incorrect words —Comprehension is measured at a very simple 
level by the Chapman-Cook Speed of Reading Test (61), which includes a 
series of easy paragraphs of approximately equal difficulty. In the case of 
each paragraph the reader is directed to cross out the one word that is 
incorrect. 
Filling in words to complete the meaning.—In the Stanford Achieve- 
ment Test comprehension is measured by means of a series of short para- 
graphs of increasing difficulty, in each of which a word or group of words 
is omitted. The reader fills in the apprapriate words as he reads. 
Selecting the central idea.—In the Woody Silent Reading Test compre- 
hension is measured (428) by means of a series of paragraphs of increasing 
difficulty. Each paragraph is followed by five statements. The reader is 
directed to select the statement which best represents the central idea of 
the paragraph. 
Following directions—The Burgess Scale for Measuring Ability in 
Silent Reading (48) contains a series of paragraphs of equal difficulty, each 
of which directs the reader to mark in some way the picture which accom- 
panies it. Accomplishment is expressed in terms of the number of exercises 
completed correctly in five minutes. Other examples of the use of direc- 
tions in measuring comprehension are found in the Kansas Silent Reading 
Tests (213) and in the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Tests (264). 
One fundamental difference between these tests and the Burgess test is 
that the latter determines the number of exercises of approximately equal 
difficulty which the reader is able to complete in five minutes while the 
former determines the number of exercises of increasing difficulty that 
can be interpreted in given periods of time. Unfortunately, the elements 
that contribute to difficulty have not been carefully controlled. 
Answering questions—The Courtis Silent Reading Test No. 2 (70) 
measures comprehension by means of a series of questions that can be 
answered by “Yes” or “No.” The pupil is at liberty to re-read a passage 
as many times as necessary in order to determine the correct answer, 
Other tests, such as the Thorndike Scale Alpha A for Measuring the Un-
-P-A-G-E-221
READING TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 213 
derstanding of Sentences (374) and the Thorndike-McCall Silent Reading 
Tests (243), include questions which may be answered by re-reading the 
passages. The Fordyce test (96), on the other hand, includes questions 
which must be answered from memory. It is evident that these tests 
measure somewhat different groups of abilities. : 
Many comprehension tests contain so-called “judgment” questions, ° 
which require the pupil not only to find items of information in the test 
passages but also to weigh values or to draw conclusions. The answers to 
such questions may be determined in the Thorndike Scale Alpha A (374) 
as the pupil reads or re-reads a passage. In the Gray Silent Reading Tests 
(231) such questions must be answered after the passage has been read 
once. 
The comprehension tests which make use of questions are open to 
additional criticisms: (1) They differ widely in the percentage of “factual” 
and “judgment” questions which they contain. (2) Some are based on 
selections, all parts of which are of approximately equal difficulty, while 
others are based on passages of different degrees of difficulty. (3) The ques- 
tions are simply worded in some tests and are more or less complex or 
involved in other tests. (4) The judgment questions of some tests require 
a great wealth of experience and not infrequently technical information, 
while such questions in other tests are far less involved. 
Reproducing.—Several tests make use of reproductions as measures of 
comprehension. The Starch silent reading test (350) was one of the 
earliest of this group. Comprehension is determined in this test “by count- 
ing the number of words written which correctly reproduce the thought.” 
The Gray Silent Reading Tests (131) make use of essentially the same 
method. In the Brown Silent Reading Test (42) the number of ideas re- 
produced is counted. One score is based on the number of ideas re- 
produced in substance; a second score is based on the number of ideas 
accurately reproduced. All reproduction tests are seriously complicated 
by the fact that they involve the use of memory to a very large extent. 
Reproducing passages and answering questions—The Gray Silent 
Reading Tests (131) make use of both reproductions and answers to ques- 
tions. It is evident that the composite scores of such tests are not com- 
parable with the scores of tests which measure comprehension by a single 
measure. / 
Answering questions and responding to directions —The Monroe Stand- 
ardized Silent Reading Tests (264) and the Silent Reading Test of the 
Illinois Examination (265) measure comprehension by both answers to 
questions and responses to directions,
-P-A-G-E-222
214 INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO. READING 
Concluding statements—The foregoing discussion shows clearly that 
efforts have been made to measure reading in various ways and that 
numerous phases or types of reading ability are included. The tests which 
are available are composed of different types of passages of various de- 
grees of difficulty. In very few of the tests are these variable factors con- 
trolled or eliminated. Furthermore, the responses which are required 
stimulate various attitudes on the part of the reader. The investigations 
of Judd, and Buswell (203) show clearly that differences in the content or 
difficulty of the passages or in the purpose of reading are accompanied by 
differences in the processes involved in reading. As a result, it is difficult 
to determine the extent to which a specific phase of reading is measured 
by many of the tests. It is also impossible to make comparisons of the 
records that are secured. : 
NEED FOR A SYSTEMATIC REORGANIZATION OF READING TESTS 
Essential steps —In order to place the measurement of achievement in 
reading on a thoroughly scientific basis, the following steps are essential: 
(1) ae ets a ae in clear and unmistak- 
able terms so that they can be readily distinguished; (2) the preparation 
of tests of various degrees of difficulty for each important phase of read- 
ing; and (3) the control of variable factors in test materials and testing 
so that the results of tests are true measures of achievement in clearly 
defined phases or types of reading. This procedure should lead ultimately 
to the abandonment of most of the test material in current use and to the 
adoption of more scientific tests which provide accurate measures of 
achievement in reading.

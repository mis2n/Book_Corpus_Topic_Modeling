INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 
Tue topics and questions herein presented have grown up in 
the actual class-room experience of the past twelve years. Until 
1921 the questions were given to the class, topic at a time, on 
separate sheets, and each succeeding year underwent more or less 
modification. Effort has been made to maintain this frequent 
revision even in the printed form, this being the fourth edition 
in five years. 
The daily work of the classes where these questions are used 
consists of three parts: (1) individual reading and study of the 
topic; (2) a preliminary consideration of the questions in a vol- 
untary “discussion group” of from five to ten class members; 
finally (3) the discussion of the questions in class by the stu- 
dents under the direction of the instructor. The procedure is 
designed to make the students think for themselves, to avoid giv- 
ing to them ready-made opinions. The effort is to bring home 
to each student some of the more vital problems in the philosophy 
of education. In the class discussion each student is expected 
to be able and ready to present and maintain an intelligent posi- 
tion on each question. Opposing considerations are contrasted 
and discussed. All this to the end that the student may feel the 
grip of the problem under consideration and obtain at least a 
fair idea of the contending principles at issue. That the stu- 
dents may more certainly do their own thinking and more freely 
present their views, the instructor’s view is reserved for the final 
summing up, and then if given is presented merely as a personal 
opinion which the students may be interested to hear. 
The bibliographical references are for daily use and make no 
pretense at completeness. Rather do they refer to books avail- 
able for the class in the Teacher College library. In spite of mis- 
givings the experiment is being tried, in this edition for the first 
time, of assigning specific reading references to the separate ques- 
tions of the several topics. That this will be a convenience to the 
student is evident. The total advantage is, however, not so clear.

  1, THE MEANING OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF 
EDUCATION 
1. What if any educational disputes do you think John Wesley 
and Voltaire would engage in if alive to-day? 
* 546, 8, 9, 337, 401. 
2. If the different points of view of Thomas Jefferson and Na- 
poleon Bonaparte were worked out in thoroughgoing consist- 
ency, in what details of education would they differ? In what 
agree? 
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15; J (Napoleon). 
3. Can you give any striking instance, ancient or modern, where 
any group has sought to introduce or maintain or spread any 
social or political régime by means of education? Was the 
reliance placed on curriculum or on method? 
5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 274, 241, 247, 268; N, pp. 159 £.; P, Chap. 9; L, pp. 21-23, 36-38, 51-54, 75-76, 86-87, 124-30, 139-50. 
4. What if any life interests outside of education make demands 
upon education? Do any of these demands conflict? If so, 
what then? 
D, Chap. 9; E, Chap. 2. 
5. Which precedes, experience or reflection? Always? How? 
Discuss the thesis : 
Experience: reflection = philosophy: life = philosophy of 
education : education. 
F, pp. 169-74. 
6. How many people have philosophies? Have you one? 
1,-2, 35-G;-Chap. 1;.K>-pp. 11 ft. 
7. State some questions that seem to you to belong rather’ to the 
philosophy of education than to any other field. 
* Numbers standing thus alone refer to items in the author’s Source Book 
in the Philosophy of Education (The Macmillan Company, New York, 
1923). Letters refer to the corresponding books listed in the accompany- 
ing topic bibliography. 
cy
-P-A-G-E-16
  8. What does the philosophy of education mean? What service 
should it render? Would these questions come better at the 
close of the course? 
J (Philosophy of Education) ; C, pp. vii-xiv; F, pp. 115-16, Chap. 24; 
O; H, pp. 57, 63 ff.; B, pp. 1-21; M, Chap. 1; Q, pp. 21-32; A, Chap. 1;

2. THE BASES OF ACTION AND ENDEAVOR 
. Suppose a fierce dog is approaching. What are some of the 
things (experiences) that might conceivably happen to you? 
Would these be equally acceptable? Suppose all were equally 
acceptable, what kind of world would we have? 
. As you see the dog approaching, what different lines of con- 
duct might you conceivably follow? What part would think- 
ing play here? How would past experiences enter? Is the 
future implicated ? 
29, 28; B, pp. 169-74, 177. 
. Are the elements (things) in the situation of Q. 2 movable at 
your option? All? Equally? How important is this fact of 
movability? Do you use it in your endeavors? 
. What does it mean that a certain contemplated evil is avoid- 
able (or contemplated good is attainable)? Is avoidability (or 
attainability) a fact? Always? Ever? When and how? In 
the light of these considerations (including questions 2 and 
3) what is the meaning of inevitable? Of optional? Of con- 
trol? 
B, pp. 396-98. 
. How much of life activity and experience proceeds on the 
principle assumed here in questions 1, 3, and 4? Must these 
principles be assumed? 
26. 
. From the foregoing is it reasonable to put forth endeavor? 
And expect results to follow? Always? When? 
A, pp. 319-31. 
. What if any definition of freedom emerges from the fore- 
going? How may such freedom be increased? 
31; C, 309-13; D.

3. THE SOCIAL INHERITANCE. SOCIALIZATION 
. What is a problem and when does it arise? What, prag- 
matically, is a solution? Can a solution be used again? Can 
it be passed on to another? 
489, 529. 
2. In the light of Q. 1 show how a social custom is a solution to 
a social problem. How if at all does this conception apply 
to the common law? To statute laws? To moral codes? To 
institutions in general? To the evaluation of institutions? How 
is habit involved ? 
60; Q, Chap. 1; L, pp. 389-94, 405 ff. 
3. Might a valuable solution be lost? Where are such kept? 
How are they transmitted? 
4. What is the difference between the biological and the social 
inheritance? Are both peculiar to man? 
39, 38, 40; A, Chap. 2; P, pp. 65-81; O, pp. 3-40. 
5. In what two senses may we speak of the continuance of so- 
ciety? How is the social inheritance related? 
G, pp. 1-22; D, pp. 21 ff., 37. 
6. Seeing that man is by instinct already “social,” what can a 
process of socialization mean? 
64, 61, 98, 192; K; J, pp. 40 ff, 53 ff.; G, pp. 15-16; I, pp. 235-45. 
7. What is the relation of the social inheritance to the process 
of socialization? 
N, Chap. 7; M, pp. 33-39; F, Chap. 28. 
8. To which does socialization properly apply: to individuals, to — 
the whole group, to sub-groups? Does the conception hold as 
between nations? 
63, 67, 58, 62, 198; G, pp. 96-102. 
9. What if any light does the foregoing throw on a proper mean- 
ing of “Americanization” ? 
D, pp. 55 ff.; C, pp. 54-62. 
[19]
-P-A-G-E-24
    10. What suggestions if any do you get from the foregoing in 
the matter of school aims? School procedure? Curriculum 
content? Selecting school teachers? 
41, 45(1) ; G, pp. 414-17; H, Chap. 2; E, pp. 278-79.

20. EDUCATION ITS OWN END 
. In the light of the discussion on “activity leading to further 
activity” what is the meaning of immaturity? Of develop- 
ment? How does development thus conceived differ from 
development as the unfolding of latency? 
455, 456; I (Development) ; C, pp. 49-54, 65-67; A, pp. 79-80. 
. “There is nothing to which education is subordinate save more 
education.” (Dewey, Democracy and Education, p. 60). 
What does this mean? What is the relation of this state- 
ment to “activity leading to further activity’? To growing? 
J, Chap. 10. . 
. What is here meant by growing? Wherein if at all does this 
differ from the usual meaning of the term? Does such a con- 
ception of growing sufficiently consider the democratic rela- 
tion of the individual to others? :

. Why does Dewey (Democracy and Education, p. 89) object 
to finding an aim for education outside the process of educa- 
tion? How could he find a more satisfactory aim? 
I (End in Education.) 
. What conception of progress (or of the development of civili- 
zation) do you get from the conceptions of questions 1 and 4? 
How can we practically guide such a process from within? 
394, C, pp. 96, 117-24; G, pp. 77-82.

21. EDUCATION AS THE RECONSTRUCTION OF 
EXPERIENCE 
1. In an experience what factors are always present (such that 
without them no experience would ensue)? What happens, 
typically, to these factors when they come together in an ex- 
perience? 
30; C, pp. 163 f. 
2. From Q. 1 what do you conclude as to the relations between the 
experience process and the educative process? 
457; C, pp. 317-18. 
3. How much of life consists of experience? Name several 
things that have in no wise affected your experience. Must 
one be conscious of all the things that affect one’s experience? 
23, 24. 
4. Trace in an instance of your own experience the successive 
steps in typical out-of-school learning (Foundations of Method, 
pp. 279 ff.) In this instance what was learned and how was 
it tested? Which term better describes what was here learned, 
“behavior-pattern” or “way-of-behaving”? How widely ap- 
plicable is this analysis? 
5. How soon afterwards was the learning outcome in your ex- 
perience of Q. 4 utilized in subsequent experience? How did 
this learning open up new possibilities of experience? What 
new demands followed these new experiences thus opened up? 
C, p. 255. 
6. From Q. 5 what is meant by the reconstruction of experience? 
By the continuous reconstruction of experience?

7. Rank the following according to their general tendency to re- 
enter and remake experience: Learning (1) to read, (2) to 
walk, (3) to fly a kite, (4) to factor in algebra, (5) to play 
[91]

AHOOW> ball, (6) to dance, (7) to read Latin, (8) to “shoot craps,” (9) 
to understand the laws of learning, (10) to tell the truth. 
. What more important considerations determine relative posi- 
tion in Q. 7? What if any connections here with Topic 6? 
With Topic 20? 
C, pp. 180-82. 
. Arrange the following in the order of degree in the recon- 
struction of. experience effected (considering only the intended 
work and its effect): (1) best kindergarten now, (2) typical 
Sth grade in 1880, (3) best boy’s camp now, (4) best Ist 
grade now, (5) typical 5th grade now, (6) best high school 
in 1880, (7) best high school now, (8) your present work at 
Teachers College, (9) typical child life of three.

22. THE PROBLEM OF METHOD 
[The questions below assume a working knowledge of Thorn- 
dike’s laws of learning (Source Book, 522, or Foundations of 
Method, Chaps. 2 and 3), also of the discussions in Foundations 
of Method on mind-set and learning (pp. 66-75), coercion and 
learning (pp. 79-88), simultaneous learnings (pp. 8-10, 102-3), 
and the broad vs. the narrow problem of method (pp. 10-18). 
For a general survey of the essential point of view under con- 
sideration in this and succeeding topics the student is advised © 
to browse around in Sanderson of Oundle, H. Caldwell Cook’s 
The Play Way, and Collings, An Experiment with a Project 
Curriculum.) 
1. Is method a question of how the child should act or of how the 
teacher should act? 
B, pp. 540-43; G, pp. 161-63. 
2. What difficult or obscure or doubtful points do you see in the 
discussions on mind-set and learning and on coercion and learn- 
ing referred to above? 
498, 499, 505, 507, 508, 509, 525; J; A, Chaps. 10, 14; F; pp. 165-75. 
3. If it be granted (as must be) that teachers cannot always have 
the kind and degree of purposing they may wish, what is the 
value of the conclusions reached on mind-set (purposing) and 
learning ? 
526; G, pp. 205 ff., 242-45, 324-30; C, pp. 41-53; D, pp. 68-86. 
4. In the light of the discussions referred to above what if any 
proper place remains for the use of coercion? 
498, 504, 511; C, pp. 54-73; A, pp. 62-66, 73, 123, Chap. 9. 
5. How can educators practically use the conceptions of primary, 
associate and concomitant learning? How utilize the distinc- 
tion between the broad and the narrow problems of method? 
112, 270, 480, 553; B, p. 543; H, pp. 212-17, 396-409, 316-17.

23. SUBJECT-MATTER AND THE EDUCATIVE 
PROCESS I 
. How is the conception of “intrinsic” (vs. “extrinsic”) learning 
(Foundations of Method, pp. 284-86) connected with typical 
out-of-school learning as analyzed in Q. 4 of Topic 21? 
J, pp. 291 ff. 
. What proportion of the learning is “intrinsic” in the following: 
(1) the best first grade now, (2) an average fourth grade 
now, (3) typical child life of three, (4) the life of the typi- 
cal American business man, (5) the typical preparatory school 
curriculum ? 
491. 
. In the opposed positions of “intrinsic” and “extrinsic” learning, 
contrast the differing-occasions which call for study and learn- 
ing; the differing tests as to whether learning has taken place; 
the differing intervals before the learning re-enters the experi- 
ence process; the differing meanings of subject-matter.

66; I, 2: 95-101, 230-36; C, pp. 7-15; D, pp. 158, 212-27. 
. What different method procedures tend to accompany “ex- 
trinsic’ and “intrinsic” learning respectively? With what 
differing results in primary, associate and concomitant learnings 
respectively? Why is this? With what differing effect on 
the resulting unity of the self? How so?

I, 2: 235-36, 367-76; C, pp. 31-40; D, pp. 165 ff. 
. Can everything that is learned be considered as a way-of-be- 
having? What apparent exceptions can you name? How 
about such subjects as spelling, history, science? How about 
such facts as, ice is cold, three feet equal one yard? How 
about scientific laws, as Boyle’s? Are all these real exceptions?

  . Of what service is the conclusion drawn in Q. 5? a E 
. How does preparation for the future enter into the common 
conception of the educative process? What is meant in con- 
nection by “deferred values”? How if at all is preparation 
cared for in the conceptions of Topics 20 and 21? 
272, 461, 501; G, 183-86; F, pp. 24-27. 
What are the respective advantages and disadvantages of these 
two ways of caring for preparation? Does Q. 6 of Topic 
5 have any pertinence here? y

24. SUBJECT-MATTER AND THE EDUCATIVE 
PROCESS II 
. If you were seeking the best possible reconstruction of ex- 
perience for a child of three, how would you manage affairs? 
What if any use would you make of achievement norms for the 
age of three (supposing such were available) ? 
454, 457-62, 467, 470-73, 478, 492. 
. How would the answers of Q. 1 be changed if the child were 
ten years of age and had to be educated, along with others, 
out of school? How if the age were twenty (still out of 
school) ? 
474, 476, 477; F, Chaps. 8, 9. 
. Considering Topic 20 and questions 1 and 2 above, what aims 
shall we set up by which to guide the reconstruction of experi- 
ence? What is Dewey’s answer? (Source Book, 45 [2]; 
Democracy and Education, pp. 36, 89-91, 117-24). Does such 
an answer seem sufficient? How does it fit with Topic 20? 
E, pp. 197 f. 
. What is the relation of subject-matter to the race experience? 
B, pp. 15 ff.; A, pp. 8 £.; C, pp. 213, 220-27. 
. To what extent is it wise to remove subject-matter of learn- 
ing from its natural life setting? What are the pros and 
cons? Is the child’s imagination a factor? What is the usual 
school procedure? What is feasible? 
469, 475, 501; A, pp. 75-78, 152; G, pp. 263-67. 
. What are the comparative effects of the “intrinsic” and the 
“extrinsic” procedures on the teacher’s function? 
285 (1), 453, 526; D, 2: 370-72; C, p. 127. 
. Since the teacher admittedly cannot order at will that the learn- 
ing be “intrinsic,” what shall the educator do?

25. THE LOGIC OF EXPERIENCE 
. What is a problem? When does it arise? 
B, pp. 10, 72. 
. How is the process of deliberation conducted? 
489, 529, 541. 
. What are the steps in Dewey’s analysis of the complete act of 
thought? What logical connections do you see among them? 
B, p. 72. 
. .What is a solution (to a problem)? What are the criteria by 
which one may tell when a solution has been reached? 
. Imagine a practical life situation where opposing demands cre- 
ate a problem. When a solution to such a situation has been 
reached, what happens to these previously opposing considera- 
tions? Do they cease to oppose each other, being now recon- 
ciled? Does one win sole consideration and in this manner 
conquer the others? Do the opposed considerations reach a 
compromise whereby all lose in part? Do all continue their 
undiminished opposition, the solution being their resultant like 
the “composition of forces” in physics? Are there other possi- 
bilities ? 
D, pp. 325-26; A, p. 1; C, p. 6. 
. If aims and obstacles are present as opposing factors in a prac- 
tical problem, do they enter on equal footing? Should we treat 
them alike? 
. What. bearing has the foregoing discussion on the need and use 
of ideals in practical life matters? What if any illustrations 
of this have we already had?

26. CURRICULUM THEORIES 
1. Compare the curriculum theories of Bobbitt, Bonser, Charters, 
Collings, Meriam, and the New York “Regents” in such way 
as to bring out their most striking contrasts. 
2. Conceive a scale on which the theories of Q. 1 might be as- 
signed. What opposed answers would the extremes of this 
scale (not necessarily represented by any of the theories 
named) return to the following questions: 
(1) How shall the content of the curriculum be conceived and 
stated ? 
(2) Is the curriculum to be made in advance? 
(3) How shall we conceive educational objectives? 
(4) How is preparation for the future to be provided? 
(5) How is drill to be cared for? 
(6) To what extent is organization (of subject-matter) a mat- 
ter of pupil construction? 
(7) To what extent are traits to be learned in their natural 
setting? 
(8) To what extent and how shall the conception of minimum 
essentials be used in curriculum construction? 
(9) What is the place of the expert in curriculum making? 
The place of the teacher? The place of the pupils? 
(10) To what extent can the curriculum be made “scien- 
tifically” ?

27. A PROPOSED CURRICULUM THEORY 
. Consider these four conceptions: method as discussed in Topic 
22, “education its own end,” the continuous reconstruction of 
experience, “intrinsic” learning. To what extent are these 
compatible with each other? To what extent do they neces- 
sarily demand each other? 
. Where would such curriculum making as is implied in Q. 1 
come on the scale of Q. 2, Topic 26? How would it answer 
the several questions there propounded? What differing an- 
swers should we consider? Which accept? 
G. 
. What has been the general tendency of school practice during 
the past century as regards this scale? 
. Consider typical school equipment of to-day and typical pro- 
visions for school management and administration. Which of 
these hold such fixed places on this scale of Q. 2 Topic 26 as 
to hinder movement of curriculum practice up the scale? 
524; C, pp. 22-45; D, pp. 31-35. 
. What are the good and the bad effects of such a scheme of 
external examinations as the New York “Regents”? 
. What if any use can the curriculum theory of Q. 1 make of a 
systematic arrangement of educational “objectives” (like Bob- 
bitt’s or the scheme in the Cardinal Principles of Secondary 
Education)? What if any sort of printed course of study 
could it have? 
H, pp. 361-67; I; B, pp. 144-45; F, pp. 10-25. 
. What considerations principally demand that we move further 
up the scale of Q. 2 Topic 26? What considerations chiefly 
oppose? What conclusion do you draw? How is Q. 7 Topic 
25 pertinent?

  28. ORGANIZATION 
[These questions assume familiarity with the discussion in 
Foundations of Method, Chap. 18.] 
. Show from your own experience how the successful pursuit 
of a practical purpose serves to organize experience along that 
line? What difference here with differing ages? [Illustrate 
from your work this year how problem solving tends to or- . 
ganize the whole field in which a problem is located. 
H, pp. 68, 202-3, 243-46, 249, 358-60; G, pp. 16-31. 
. Why is organization desirable? Must it be sought consciously 
or does it come of itself? How do the laws of learning enter? 
B, pp. 546 f., 554 f.; L, pp. 323, 347-48, 382-86; K, Chap. 5; I, Chap. 
5; G, pp. 1-15, 32-51. 
. What if any relation have organization and method? Would 
different theories of method mean different organizations? 
For the child or for the teacher? 
F, pp. 95 £.; A, pp. 99 ff; J, Chap. 11. 
. What is a concept? What is it for? How is it built? Any 
suggestion here from “psychological and logical” ? 
532, 535. 
. How did you build the chronological order organization of his- 
tory which you actually have? Did you study the events in 
their chronological order? If yes, did it help? If no, did it 
hurt? 
F, pp. 160-64. 
. What are the main differences between the psychological and 
the logical order of studying a subject? What are the respec- 
tive advantages and disadvantages? Illustrate with chem- 
istry, with the English language. 
481, 482, 483, 491; B, pp. 25-30; E, 57-62; D, pp. 256-66. 
[119]  
-P-A-G-E-124
  . Suppose you believe in the psychological order as opposed to 
the logical order of teaching. Would you then give no thought 
to order? If not, what considerations would you take into

29. THE USE OF PURPOSEFUL ACTIVITY 
[The questions given below assume familiarity with the dis- 
cussions given in Foundations of Method, Chaps. 13 and 21.] 
1. Is it desirable or wise to attempt to name the conception of 
method here under discussion? What if any relation exists 
between validity and name? What if any disputes in this 
connection do you care to consider? What if any principles 
are involved in the disputes? 5 
R, pp. 43-90; C, pp. 137-39; Q, pp. 268-70; P, pp. 324-28: I; L, pp. 344- 
47; K, pp. 172-74. tv Give original illustrations of the four types of purposeful ac- 
tivity. What other types would you care to suggest? Why? 
3. If you had an additional step to propose to the analysis of the 
first type, what would it be? How well does this analysis fit 
the three other types? To what extent should a child be made 
conscious of such steps? 
4. What criteria should be used in evaluating suggested enter- 
prises (“projects”) ? 
B, pp. 371 ff, 410; G, p. 44; A, pp. 90-101, 147-49; F, pp. 121-24; E, 
pp. 324-30; N, pp. 382-83; J, Chaps. 4, 5. 
5. What kind and degree of child freedom does this procedure 
contemplate? What is the place of the teacher? 
285 (2), 526; D, pp. 68-86; O, Chap. 7; H, pp. 132-40, 157-63; P, pp. 
56-59; E, p. 323; J, Chap. 8. 
6. If this general point of view be accepted, what should be the 
consistent practice in the matter of: 
a. The use of separate studies (as history, arithmetic, etc.) ? 
b. Departmentalization? 
c. Classification and promotion of pupils? 
d. The daily program? 
e. Textbooks ? 
[123]

7. What principal considerations favor a régime of purposeful 
activity? Do these hold equally of all grades? What chief 
dangers and difficulties oppose? What is at present feasible? 
If you desired such a régime how would you introduce it? 
265, 278, 508, 509, 527; H, pp. 296-305; A, pp. 105 f.; K, pp. 166, 172-

. Does ordinary (secular) educational psychology suffice for the 
discussion of this topic? If not, what else is needed? 
. Having in mind the genesis of character, what essential ele- 
ments in a good moral character would you name? What is 
the genetic psychology of each such element? What is the 
correlative school procedure? How do the laws of learning 
enter?

164-68; B, pp. 84-97, 103 f.; D; 407-10. 
. What do you think of the use of stories or pictures for char- 
acter building? Is the good effect of a good story as great as 
the bad effect of a bad story? If yes, how so? If no, why

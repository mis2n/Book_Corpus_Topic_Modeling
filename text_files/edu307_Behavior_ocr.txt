PREFACE 
  This volume on behavior is an elaboration of the eight 
lectures given at Columbia University during the winter 
of 1913. It has been written with the hope that it 
may be found serviceable in classroom work in psychol- 
ogy and biology. Needless technicalities and detailed 
references have been omitted. For this reason the general 
reader may find something of interest in its pages. The 
book must not be looked upon as a reference book or 
treatise. The treatment of the research material has not 
been exhaustive. For the most part no attempt has been 
made to give investigators detailed credit for their work. 
I have not, however, been able to carry out consistently the 
plan of omitting references. In most sciences which have 
existed for any length of time a general body of data be- 
comes common property, and it is unnecessary to mention 
the original discoverers of the universally accepted facts. 
Some parts of the study of behavior are so involved in con- 
troversy that no results can be said as yet to be universally 
accepted by specialists in the subject. In dealing with 
these facts, especially in the chapters on the sense organs, 
it has been necessary to enter with some detail into the 
discussion of the investigations and theories of individual 
writers. It is hoped that the volume will contribute some- 
thing towards the introduction of more careful methods in 
the study of behavior, and serve to mark off the study from 
the other sciences. 
An endeavor has been made to adapt the book to the 
needs of various classes of readers. Where only a short 
time can be devoted to a classroom course in behavior, I 
suggest that chapters I, II, III, V, VII, and IX be omitted. 
In the preparation of the manuscript my heaviest obliga- 
tion is to Dr. K. 8. Lashley, Bruce Fellow in Biology, the 
Johns Hopkins University. He has given unsparingly of

his time in helping in the actual preparation of the chap- 
ters on the origin of instincts and the fixation of ares in 
habits. Dr. H. M. Johnson has assisted me greatly by fur- 
nishing the drawing and description of the Helmholtz 
method of tandem-driven forks. 
I owe a heavy debt of gratitude to my colleagues Profes- 
sors Arthur O. Lovejoy and Knight Dunlap for kindly eriti- 
cisms and helpful suggestions during the preparation both 
of the Columbia lectures and of the manuscript of the book. 
My long and intimate association with Robert M. Yerkes 
and with Harvey Carr has been of great benefit to me. I 
owe them much more than can be gathered from a mere 
reading of the following pages. 
Finally I wish to express my indebtedness to my secre- 
tary, Miss Clarice Shoemaker, who has been untiring in her 
work upon the manuscript.

Summary. 
  Unsatisfactory nature of present psychological prem- 
ises.—Psychology as the behaviorist views it is a purely 
objective experimental branch of natural science. Its theo- 
retical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. In- 
trospection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the 
scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness 
with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms 
of consciousness. The behaviorist attempts to get a unitary 
scheme of animal response. He recognizes no dividing line 
between man and brute. The behavior of man, with all of 
its refinement and complexity, forms only a part of his total 
field of investigation. 
“Tt has been maintained by its followers generally that 
psychology is a study of the science of the phenomena of 
consciousness. It has taken.as its problem, on the one 
hand, the analysis of complex mental states (or processes) 
into simple elementary constituents, and on the other the 
construction of complex states when the elementary con- 
stituents.are-given. The world of physical objects (stimuli, 
including here anything which may excite activity in a 
receptor), which forms the total phenomenon of the natural 
scientist, is looked upon merely as means to an end. The 
+A few new terms have been used in this discussion of behavior— 
such as behaviorist, behavioristic, behaviorism. While it is admitted 
that these words sound somewhat barbarie on a first hearing, they 
at least have the merit. of being expressive and natural. Indulgence 
is also asked for the use of “perseverance method” in place of 
“trial and error” method in the description of the experiments on 
learning.
-P-A-G-E-16
2 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
  end is the production of mental states that may be ‘‘ in- 
spected ’’ or ‘‘ observed.’? VThe psychological object of 
observation in the case of an emotion, e.g., is the mental 
state itself. The problem in emotion is the determination 
of the number and kind of elementary constituents present, 
their loci, intensity, order of appearance, ete. It is agreed 
that introspection is the method par excellence by means 
of which mental states may be manipulated for purposes of 
psychology. On this assumption, behavior data (including 
under this term everything which goes under the name 
of comparative psychology) have no value per se. They 
possess significance only in so far as they may throw light 
upon conscious states.2 Such data must have at least an 
analogical or indirect reference to belong to the realm of 
psychology. 
Indeed, one finds at times psychologists who are skeptical 
of even this analogical reference. Such skepticism is often 
shown by the question which is put to the student of 
behavior, ‘‘ what is the bearing of animal work upon 
human psychology? ’’ With psychology based upon its 
_ present premises such a question is necessarily embarrassing 
for the reason that no answer is open to the man who 
uses animals for subjects. The behaviorist has found it 
convenient in the past to cultivate a repressed attitude 
when talking of his work before orthodox psychologists. 
He is interested in this work and believes firmly in its 
intrinsic value, albeit he is unable to trace its bearing upon _ 
psychological theory. Such a confession it is hoped will 
clear the atmosphere to such an extent that the behaviorist 
will no longer have to work under false pretenses. We 
in turn must frankly admit that the facts which we have 
been able to glean from extended work upon the senses 
of animals by behavior methods have contributed only in a 
fragmentary way to the general theory of human sense 
organ processes: and that they have not even suggested new 
ways of making experimental attacks upon the problems of 
human psychology. The enormous number of experiments 
?TLe., either directly upon the conscious state of the observer or 
indirectly upon the conscious state of the experimenter, 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
PSYCHOLOGICAL PREMISES 3 
  which we have carried out upon learning has likewise 
contributed little to human psychology. It seems reason- 
ably clear that some kind of compromise must be effected ; 
either psychology must change its viewpoint so as to take 
in facts of behavior, whether or not they have bearing upon 
the problems’ of ‘‘ consciousness; ’’ or else behavior must 
stand alone as a wholly separate and independent science. 
Should human psychologists fail to look with favor upon 
our overtures and refuse to modify their position, the be- 
haviorists will be driven to use human beings as subjects 
and to employ methods of investigation which are exactly 
comparable to those now employed in the animal work. 
Any other hypothesis than that which admits the independ- 
ent value of the behavior material will inevitably force 
us to the absurd position of attempting to construct the 
conscious content of the animal whose behavior we have 
been studying. On this theory, after having determined 
our animal’s ability to learn, the simplicity or complexity of 
its methods of learning, the effect of past habit upon pres- 
ent response, the range of stimuli to which it ordinarily re- 
sponds, the widened range to which it can respond under 
experimental conditions,—in more general terms, its va- 
rious problems and its various ways of solving them,—we 
should still feel that the task is unfinished and that the 
results are worthless, until we can interpret them by 
analogy in the light of consciousness. Although we have 
solved our problem we feel uneasy and unrestful because 
of our definition of psychology: we feel forced to say 
something about the possible mental processes of our ani- 
mal. We say that, having no eyes, its stream of conscious- 
ness cannot contain brightness and color sensations as we 
know them,—having no taste buds this stream cannot 
contain sensations of sweet, sour, salt, and bitter. But 
on the other hand, since it does respond to thermal, tactual, 
and organic stimuli, its conscious content must be made 
up largely of these sensations; and we usually add, to 
protect ourselves against the reproach of being anthropo- 
morphic, ‘‘ If it has any consciousness.’? Surely this 
doctrine which calls for an analogical interpretation of all
-P-A-G-E-18
4 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
behavior data must be shown to be false: the position that 
the value of an observation upon behavior is determined 
by its fruitfulness in yielding results which are interpret- 
able only under the concept of consciousness. 
This emphasis upon analogy in psychology has led the 
behaviorist somewhat afield. Not being willing to throw 
off the yoke of consciousness he feels impelled to make a 
place in the scheme of behavior where the rise of conscious- 
ness can be determined. This point has been a shifting one. 
A few years ago certain animals were supposed to possess 
“* associative memory,’’ while certain others were supposed 
to lack it. One meets this search for the origin of con- 
sciousness under a good many disguises. (Some of our 
texts state that consciousness arises at the moment when 
reflex and instinctive activities fail properly to conserve the 
organism. A perfectly adjusted organism would be lack- 
ing in consciousness) On the other hand, whenever we find 
the presence of diffuse activity which results in habit 
formation, we are justified in assuming consciousness. 
Such arguments have weight with the neophyte, but as 
time goes on and the horizon of animal work broadens, he 
becomes less and less convinced of their weight. Many of 
us are still viewing behavior problems with something like 
this in mind, as is evidenced by the fact that more than one 
student of behavior has attempted to frame criteria of the 
psychic—to devise a set of objective, structural, and func- 
tional criteria which, when applied to the particular 
instance, will enable him to decide whether such and such 
responses are positively conscious, merely indicative of 
consciousness, or whether they are purely ‘‘ physiological.’ 
Such problems as these can no longer satisfy behavior men. 
It would be better to give up the province altogether and 
admit frankly that the study of the behavior of animals 
has no justification, than to admit that the search is of 
such a ‘‘ will o’ the wisp ’’ character. One can assume 
either the presence or the absence of consciousness any- 
where in the phylogenetic scale without affecting the 
problems of behavior by one jot or one tittle; and without 
influencing in any way the mode of experimental attack 
  \
-P-A-G-E-19
PSYCHOLOGICAL PREMISES 5 
  upon them. On the other hand, one cannot for a moment 
assume that the Paramecium responds to light; that the 
rat learns a problem more quickly by working at the task 
five times a day than once a day, or that the human child 
exhibits plateaux in his learning curves. These are ques- 
tions which vitally concern behavior and which must be 
decided by direct observation under experimental condi- 
tions. 
This attempt to reason by analogy from human conscious 
processes to the conscious processes in animals, and vice 
versa, to make consciousness, as the human being knows it, 
the center of reference of all behavior, forces us into a posi- 
tion similar to that which existed in biology in Darwin’s 
time. The whole Darwinian movement was judged by the 
bearing it had upon the origin and development of the 
human race. Expeditions were undertaken to collect 
material which would establish the position that the rise 
of the human race was a perfectly natural phenomenon 
and not an act of special creation. Variations were care- 
fully noted and along with them the evidence that they 
might be heaped up along lines which would be of service 
to the animal; for in this and the other Darwinian mechan- 
isms were to be found factors sufficiently complex to 
account for the origin and race differentiation of man. 
The wealth of material collected at this time was considered 
valuable largely in so far as it tended to develop the concept 
of evolution in man. It is strange that this situation 
should have remained the dominant one in biology for so 
many years. The moment zodlogy undertook the experi- 
mental study of evolution and descent, the situation im- 
mediately changed. Man ceased to be the center of 
reference. It is doubtful if any experimental biologist 
today, unless actually engaged in the problem of heredity 
in man, tries to interpret his findings in terms of human 
evolution, or ever refers to it in his thinking. He gathers 
his data from the study of many species of plants and 
animals and tries to work out the laws of inheritance in 
the particular type upon which he is conducting experi- 
“ments. Naturally he follows the progress of the work upon
-P-A-G-E-20
6 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
  race differentiation in man and the descent of man, but he 
looks upon these as special topics, equal in importance 
with his own yet ones in which his interests will never be 
vitally engaged. It is not fair to say that all of his work 
is directed toward human evolution or that it must be 
interpreted in terms of human evolution. He does not 
have to dismiss certain of his facts on the inheritance of 
coat color in mice because, forsooth, they have little bearing 
upon the differentiation of the genus Homo into separate 
races, or upon the descent of the genus Homo from some 
more primitive stock. 
In psychology we are still in that stage of development 
where we feel that we must select our material. We have 
a general place of discard for processes, which we anathe- 
matize so far as their value for psychology is concerned by 
saying, ‘‘ this is a reflex;’’ ‘‘ that is a purely physiological 
fact which has nothing to do with psychology.’’ We are 
not interested (as psychologists) in studying all of the 
processes of adjustment which the animal as a whole em- 
ploys, and in finding how these various responses are con- 
nected, and how they fall apart, thus working out a system- 
atic scheme for the prediction and control of response in 
general. Unless our observed facts are indicative of con- 
sciousness, we have no use for them, and unless our ap- 
paratus and method are designed to throw such facts 
into relief, they are thought of in just as disparaging a 
way. 
Psychology has failed signally during the fifty odd years 
of its existence as an experimental discipline to make its 
place in the world as an undisputed natural science. 
Psychology, as it is generally thought of, has something 
esoteric in its methods. If you fail to reproduce my find- 
ings it is not due to some fault in your apparatus or the 
control of your stimuli, but it is due to the fact that your 
introspection is untrained.* The attack is made upon the 
*In this connection attention is called to the controversy now 
on between the adherents and the opposers of imageless thought. The 
“types of reactors” (sensory and motor) was also a matter of bitter 
dispute. The complication experiment was likewise the source of a- 
war of words concerning the accuracy of the opponent’s introspection. 
 
-P-A-G-E-21

observer and not upon the experimental setting. In physics 
and in chemistry the attack is made upon the experimental 
conditions. The apparatus was not sensitive enough, im- 
pure chemicals were used, ete. In these sciences a better 
technique will give reproducible results. Psychology is 
otherwise. If you can’t observe 3—9 states of clearness in 
attention, your introspection is poor. If, on the other 
hand, a feeling seems reasonably clear to you, your in-\/ 
trospection is again faulty. You are experiencing too 
much. 
The time seems to have come when psychology must 
discard all reference to consciousness; when it need no 
longer delude itself into thinking that it is making mental 
states the object of observation. We have become so en- 
meshed in speculative questions concerning the elements of 
mind, the nature of conscious content (e.g., imageless 
thought, attitudes, and Bewusstseinslage, ete.), that experi- 
mental students are beginning to feel that something is 
wrong with the premises and the types of problem which 
develop from them. There is no longer any guarantee that 
all mean the same thing when the terms now current in 
psychology are used. Take the case of sensation. A 
sensation is defined in terms of its attributes. One psy- 
chologist will state with readiness that the attributes of a 
visual sensation are quality, extension, duration, and in- 
tensity. Another will add clearness. Still another that of 
order. It is questionable whether any one psychologist 
can draw up a set of statements describing what he means 
by sensation which will be agreed to by three other psy- 
chologists of different training. Turn for a moment to 
the question relating to the number of isolable sensations. 
Is there an extremely large number of color sensations,— 
or only four, red, green, yellow, and blue? Again, yellow, 
while psychologically simple, can be obtained by super- 
imposing red and green spectral rays upon the same dif- 
fusing surface! If, on the other hand, we say that every 
just noticeable difference in the spectrum is a simple 
sensation, and that every just noticeable increase in the 
white value of a given color gives simple sensations, we

are forced to admit that the number is so large and the 
conditions for obtaining them so complex that the concept 
of sensation is unusable, either for the purpose of analysis 
or that of synthesis. Titchener, who has fought the most 
valiant fight in this country for a psychology based upon 
introspection, feels that these differences of opinion as to 
the number of sensations and their attributes; as to whether 
there are relations (in the sense of elements) and on the 
many others which seem to be fundamental in every at- 
tempt at analysis, are perfectly natural in the present 
undeveloped state of psychology. While it is admitted that 
every growing science is full of unanswered questions, 
surely only those who are wedded to the system as we now 
have it, who have fought and suffered for it, can confidently 
believe that there will ever be any greater uniformity than 
there is now in the answers we have to such questions. 
One must believe that two hundred years from now, unless 
the introspection method is discarded, psychology will 
still be divided on the question as to whether auditory 
sensations have the quality of ‘‘ extension,’’? whether in- 
tensity is an attribute which can be applied to color, 
whether there is a difference in ‘‘ texture ’’ between image 
and sensation; and upon many hundreds of others of like 
character. 
Our psychological quarrel is not with the systematic and 
structural psychologist alone. The last fifteen years have 
seen the growth of what is called functional psychology. 
This type of psychology decries the use of elements in the 
static sense of the structuralists. It is stated in words 
which seem to throw emphasis upon the biological signifi- 
eance of conscious processes rather than upon the analysis 
of conscious states into introspectively isolable elements. 
The difference between functional psychology and strue- 
tural psychology, as the functionalists have so far stated 
the case, is unintelligible. The terms sensation, perception, 
affection, emotion, volition are used as much by the fune- 
tionalist as by the structuralist. The addition of the word 
“* process ’’ (‘‘ mental act as a whole ’’ and like terms are 
frequently met) after each serves in some way to remoye 
   
-P-A-G-E-23
   PSYCHOLOGY UNSCIENTIFIC 9 
the corpse of ‘‘ content ’’ and to leave ‘‘ function ”’ in its 
stead. Surely if these concepts are elusive when looked at 
from a content standpoint, they are still more deceptive 
when viewed from the angle of function, and espe- 
cially so when function is obtained by the introspective 
method. 
One of the difficulties in the way of a consistent func- 
tional psychology is the parallelistic hypothesis. If the 
functionalist attempts to express his formulation in terms 
which make mental states really appear to function, to 
play some active réle in the world of adjustment, he almost 
inevitably lapses into terms which are connotative of 
interaction. When taxed with this he replies that it is more 
convenient to do so and that he does it to avoid the cir- 
cumlocutions and the clumsiness of statement which are 
inherent in any thoroughgoing parallelism. As a matter 
of fact the functionalist probably thinks in terms of inter- 
action and resorts to parallelism only when forced to give 
expression to his views. We advance the view that 
behaviorism is the only consistent and logical functional- 
ai Tet one avoids both the Scylla of parallelism and 
the Charybdis of interaction. Those time-honored relics of 
philosophical speculation need trouble the student of be- 
havior as little as they trouble the student of physics. The 
consideration of the mind-body problem affects neither 
the type of problem selected nor the formulation of the 
solution of that problem. 
The nature of the behaviorist’s program.—This leads 
us to the point where argument should be made construc- 
tive. It is possible to write a psychology, to define it as 
Pillsbury does (as the ‘‘ science of behavior ’’), and never 
go back upon the definition: never to use the terms con- 
sciousness, mental states, mind, content, will, imagery, and 
the like. It can be done naturally and conveniently in a 
few years from now without running into the absurd 
terminology of Beer, Bethe, Von Uexkiill, Nuel, and that of 
the so-called objective school generally. It can be done in 
terms of stimulus and response, in terms of habit formation, 
habit integration, and the like. Furthermore it is worth 
   
-P-A-G-E-24
10 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
   while to make this attempt so far as animal psychology is 
concerned at the present time. 
A psychology of interest to all scientific men would take 
as its starting point, first, the observable fact that organ- 
isms, man and animal alike, do adjust themselves to their 
environment by means of hereditary and habit equipments. 
These adjustments may be very adequate or they may be 
so inadequate that the organism barely maintains its 
existence; secondly, certain stimuli lead the organisms to 
make the responses. In a system of psychology completely 
worked out, given the responses the stimuli can be pre- 
dicted; given the stimuli the responses can be predicted. 
Such a set of statements is crass and raw in the extreme, 
as all such generalizations must be. Yet they are hardly 
more raw and less realizable than the ones which appear 
in the psychology texts of the day. The point might better 
be illustrated by choosing an everyday problem which 
any one is likely to meet in the course of his work. Some 
time ago the author was called upon to make a study of 
certain species of birds. Until he went to Tortugas he 
had never seen these birds alive. On reaching this island 
he found the animals doing certain things: some of the 
acts seemed to work peculiarly well in such an environment, 
while others seemed to be unsuited to their type of life. 
The responses of the group as a whole were first studied 
and later those of individuals. In order to understand 
more thoroughly the relation between what was habit and 
what was hereditary in these responses, the young birds 
were captured and reared. In this way it was possible to 
study the order of appearance of hereditary adjustments 
and their complexity, and. later the beginnings of habit 
formation. The attempts to determine the stimuli which 
called forth such adjustments were crude indeed. Conse- 
quently the attempts to control behavior and to produce 
responses at will did not meet with much success: food 
and water, sex and other social relations, light and 
temperature conditions were all beyond control in a field 
study. It was found possible to control their reactions in 
a measure by using the nest and egg (or young) as stimuli,
-P-A-G-E-25
  
A BEHAVIORISTIC PROGRAM dt 
  It is not necessary here to develop further how such a 
study should be carried out and how work of this kind needs 
to be supplemented by carefully controlled laboratory 
experiments. Were the task to examine the behavior of 
some of the Australian tribes the method adopted would 
have been much the same, but the problem would have 
been more difficult: the types of responses called forth by 
physical stimuli would have been more varied, and the 
number of effective stimuli larger. The social setting of 
their lives would have had to be examined in a far more 
careful way. These savages would naturally be far more 
influenced by the responses of each other than was the 
case with the birds. Furthermore, habits would have been 
more complex and the influence of past habits upon present 
responses would have appeared more clearly. Similar 
but more complex problems would arise in working out the 
psychology of a cosmopolitan race, but the method of at- 
tacking them would be the same. In the main, the desire 
in all such work is to gain an accurate knowledge of ad- 
justments and the stimuli calling them forth. The reason 
for this is to learn general and particular methods by 
which behavior may be controlled. The goal is not ‘‘ the 
description and explanation of states of consciousness as 
such,’’ nor that of obtaining such proficiency in‘ mental 
gymnastics that one can immediately lay hold of a state 
of consciousness and say, ‘‘ this, as a whole, consists of gray 
sensation number 350, of such and such extent, occurring 
in conjunction with the sensation of cold of a certain 
intensity; one of pressure of a certain intensity and ex- 
tent,’’ and so on ad infinitum. If psychology would follow 
the plan suggested, the educator, the physician, the jurist, 
and the business man could utilize the data in a practical 
way, as soon as it could be experimentally obtained. Those 
who have occasion to apply psychological principles prac- 
tically would find no need to complain as they do at the 
present time. Ask any physician or jurist today whether 
scientific psychology plays a practical part in his daily 
routine and you will hear him deny that the psychology of 
the laboratories finds a place in his scheme of work.

12 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
The criticism is extremely just. One of the principal 
reasons which makes psychology an unattractive sub- 
ject is the fact that there is no realm of application for 
the principles which are being worked out in content 
terms. 
‘What makes us hopeful that the behaviorist’s position is 
a defensible one is the fact that those branches of psy- 
chology which have already partially withdrawn from the 
parent, experimental psychology, and which are conse- 
quently less dependent upon introspection, are today in a 
most flourishing condition. Experimental pedagogy, the 
psychology of drugs, the psychology of advertising; legal 
psychology, the psychology of tests, and psychopathology 
are all vigorous growths. These are sometimes wrongly 
called ‘‘ practical ’’ or ‘‘ applied’’ psychology. Surely there 
was never a worse misnomer. Jn the future there may 
grow up vocational bureaus which really apply psychology. 
At present these fields are truly scientific and are in search 
of broad generalizations which will lead to the control of 
human behavior. E.g., we find out by experimentation 
whether a series of stanzas may be acquired more readily 
if the whole is learned at once, or whether it is more ad- 
vantageous to learn each stanza separately and then pass 
to the succeeding. We do not attempt to apply our find- 
ings. The application of this principle is purely voluntary 
on the part of the teacher. In the psychology of drugs we 
may show the effect on behavior of certain doses of caf- 
feine. We may reach the conclusion that caffeine has a 
good effect upon the speed and accuracy of work. But 
these are general principles. We leave it to the individual 
as to whether the results of our tests shall be applied or 
not. Again, in legal testimony, we test the effects of 
recency upon the reliability of a witness’s report. We 
test the accuracy of the report with respect to moving 
objects, stationary objects, color, etc. It depends upon the 
judicial machinery of the country whether these facts are 
ever to be applied. For a ‘‘ pure ’’ psychologist to say that 
he is not interested in the questions raised in these divi- 
sions of the science because they relate indirectly to the

Re eR Pe en on ne 
A BEHAVIORISTIC PROGRAM 13 
application of psychology shows, in the first place, that he 
fails to understand the scientific aim in such problems, 
and secondly, that he is not interested in a psychology 
which concerns itself with human life. The only fault to be 
found with these disciplines is that much of their material 
is now stated in terms of introspection, whereas a state- 
ment in terms of objective results would be far more valu- 
able. There is no reason why appeal should ever be made 
to consciousness in any of them. Or why introspective 
data should ever be sought during the experimentation, or 
published in the results. In experimental pedagogy es- 
pecially we can see the desirability of keeping all of the 
results on a purely objective plane. If this is done, work 
there on the human being will be comparable directly with 
the work on animals. 
We are more interested at the present moment in trying 
to show the necessity for maintaining uniformity in ex- 
perimental procedure and in the method of stating results 
in both human and animal work than in enlarging upon the 
changes which are certain to come in the scope of human 
psychology. We shall examine for a moment the subject of 
the range of stimuli to which animals respond. Let us 
first consider the work upon vision in animals. We put . 
our animal in a situation where he will respond (or learn 
to respond) positively to one of two monochromatic lights. 
We feed him at the one (positive) and punish him at the 
other (negative). In a short time the animal learns to go 
to the light at which he is fed. At this point questions 
arise which may be phrased in two ways: one may choose 
the psychological way and say, ‘‘ does the animal see these 
two lights as the human being does, i.e., as two distinct 
colors, or does it see them as two grays differing in bright- 
ness, as do the totally color blind? ’’ Phrased by the 
behaviorist it would read as follows: ‘‘ Is my animal re- 
sponding upon the basis of the difference in intensity be- 
tween the two stimuli, or upon the difference in 
wave-lengths? ’’ He nowhere thinks of the animal’s re- 
sponse in terms of his own experiences of colors and grays. 
He wishes to establish the fact whether wave-length is a 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
14 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
factor in that animal’s adjustment. If so, what wave- 
lengths are effective and what differences in wave-length 
must be maintained in the different spectral regions in 
order to afford bases for differential responses? If wave- 
length is not a factor in adjustment he wishes to know what 
difference in intensity will serve as a basis for response, and 
whether the difference obtained at any one point in the 
spectrum will suffice throughout the spectrum. Further- 
more, he wishes to test whether the animal can respond to 
wave-lengths which do not affect the human eye. He is 
as much interested in comparing the rat’s spectral sensi- 
bility curve with that of the chick as in comparing it with 
man’s. The point of view when the various sets of com- 
parisons are made does not change in the slightest. 
However we phrase the question to ourselves, we take 
our animal after the association has been formed and 
introduce certain control experiments which enable us to 
return answers to the questions just raised. But there is 
just as keen a desire on our part to test man under the 
same conditions, and to state the results in both cases in 
common terms. 
The man and the animal should be placed as nearly as 
possible under the same experimental conditions. Instead 
of feeding or punishing the human subject, we should ask 
him to respond by setting a second apparatus until stand- 
ard and control offered no basis for a differential response. 
Do we lay ourselves open to the charge here that we are 
using introspection? The reply is, Not at all; while we 
might very well feed the human subject for a right choice 
and punish him for a wrong one, and thus produce the re- 
sponse if the subject could give it, there is no need of going 
to extremes even on the platform we suggest. But it should 
be understood that we are merely using this second method 
as an abridged behavior method.’ We can go just as far 
* He would have exactly the same attitude if he were conducting 
an experiment to show whether an ant would crawl over a pencil laid 
across the trail or go around it. 
* We should prefer to look upon this abbreviated method, where 
the human subject is told in words, e.g., to equate two stimuli; or to 
state in words whether a given stimulus is present or absent, ete., as

   A BEHAVIORISTIC PROGRAM 15 
                 
           
     
                 
     and reach just as dependable results by the longer method 
as by the abridged. In many cases the direct and typically 
human method cannot be safely used. Suppose that 
we doubt the accuracy of the setting of the control instru- 
ment, in the above experiment, as we very likely do if a 
defect in vision is suspected. It is hopeless for us to get 
his introspective report. He will say: ‘‘ There is no 
difference in sensation, both are reds, identical in quality.’’ 
But suppose we confront him with the standard and the 
control and so arrange the conditions that he is punished 
if he responds to the control but not if to the standard. — 
We then interchange the positions of the standard and the 
control at will and force him to attempt to respond to the 
one and not to the other. If he can learn to make the 
adjustment even after a large number of trials it is evident 
that the two stimuli do afford the basis for a differential 
response. Such a method may sound nonsensical, but it is 
believed that we shall have to resort increasingly to just 
such methods where we have reason to distrust the language 
method. 
There is hardly a problem in human vision which is not 
also a problem in animal vision: mention may be made of 
the limits of the spectrum, threshold values, absolute and 
relative, flicker, Talbot’s law, Weber’s law, field of vision, 
the Purkinje phenomenon, ete. Every one. can be worked 
out by behavior methods. Many of them are being worked 
out at the present time. 
All of the work upon the senses can be consistently car- 
ried forward along the lines we have suggested for vision. 
Our results will, in the end, give an excellent picture of 
what each organ stands for in the way of function. The    
the language method in behavior. It in no way changes the status 
of experimentation. The method becomes possible merely by virtue 
of the fact that in the particular case the experimenter and his 
animal have systems of abbreviated or shorthand behavior signs 
(language), any one of which may stand for a habit belonging to the 
repertoire both of the experimenter and his subject. To make the 
data obtained by the language method virtually the whole of behavior 
—or to attempt to mold all of the data obtained by other methods 
in terms of the one which has by all odds the most limited range— 
is putting the cart before the horse with a vengeance,

  16 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
anatomist and the physiologist may take our data and 
show, on the one hand, the structures which are responsible 
for these responses, and, on the other, the physico-chemical 
relations which are necessarily involved (physiological 
chemistry of nerve and muscle) in these and other reac- 
tions. 
To the behaviorist’s position thus briefly outlined some 
serious objections are sure to be raised. It may be argued 
that one might, if he were sufficiently foolhardy, hold such 
a view if the study of sensory responses were all that is 
demanded of the psychologist. But, alas, since imagery 
and affection are also fundamental elements (or processes?) 
of consciousness, the behaviorist, it is to be regretted, must 
be handed his. passports. Before accepting them let us 
examine the nature of the supposed mental existences 
which refuse to listen to the siren voices of the behaviorists. 
The image as a form of implicit behavior.—The most 
serious obstacle in the way of a free passage from struc- 
turalism to behaviorism. is the ‘‘ centrally aroused sensa- 
tion ’’ or ‘‘ image.’’ If thoughts go on in terms of centrally 
aroused sensations, as is maintained by the majority of 
both structural and functional psychologists, we should 
have to admit that there is a serious limitation on the side 
of method in behaviorism. Imagery from Galton on has 
been the inner stronghold of a psychology based upon 
introspection. All of the outer defenses might be given 
over to the enemy, but the cause could never wholly be 
lost so long as the pass (introspection) to this stronghold 
(image) could be maintained. 
So well guarded is the image that it would seem almost 
foolhardy for us to make an attack upon it. If we did not 
perceive certain signs of weakening on the part of the 
garrison it would seem best to agree with Professor Cattell 
that the position of the behaviorist is too radical, and that 
we should better admit the claims of imagery and try to 
work out a scheme for behaviorism which will embrace: the 
image. Suppose we consider this aspect of the question 
first: does the inclusion of the image weaken the claims 
of the behaviorist? It must be admitted that it does,
-P-A-G-E-31
IMPLICIT BEHAVIOR 17 
  Take a case like that ordinarily urged. Some one suggests 
in words that you borrow one thousand dollars and go 
abroad for a year. You think over the situation—the 
present condition of your research problems, your debts, 
whether you can leave your family, etc. You are in @ 
brown study for days trying to make up your mind. Now 
the train of thoughts going on in your mind, according to 
the upholders of the image, has no adequate behavior 
counterpart while it is in transit. The behaviorist, ob- 
serving you, might note that your appetite had departed, 
that you were smoking and drinking more than usual, and 
that you were distrait. Finally, experimental tests might 
show that your ability to make fine codrdinations had been 
seriously interfered with, and that your dynamometric 
threshold was lowered, and so on ad infinitum. The intro- 
spectionists would say that all of these tests failed to give 
anything like a complete record of your ‘‘ mental content ’’ 
or of the ‘‘ totality of conscious processes.’’? Indeed, they 
would urge that such tests have only an analogical refer- 
ence. Only direct observation of the mental states them- 
selves by the method of introspection will ever tell whether 
you are grieving over past sins or are really trying to reach 
a decision about going abroad! If we grant this, and such 
an impulse is very strong, the behaviorist must content 
himself with this reflection: ‘‘ I care not what goes on in 
his so-called mind; the important thing is that, given the 
stimulation (in this ease a series of spoken words), it must 
produce response, or else modify responses which have been 
already initiated. This is the all-important thing, and I 
will be content with it.’’ Le., he contents himself with 
observing the initial object (stimulation) and the end 
object (the reaction). Possibly the old saying, ‘‘ half 
a loaf is better than no bread at all,’’ expresses the atti- 
tude the behaviorist ought to take; and yet we dislike to 
admit anything which may be construed as an admission of 
even partial defeat. 
Feeling so, it seems wisest, even at the cost of exposing 
the weakness of our position, to attack rather than to re- 
main upon the defensive. We spoke above of certain signs
-P-A-G-E-32
18 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
of disaffection and mutiny among the ranks of the faithful. 
These signs manifest themselves in three different ways: 
(1) The attempt on the part of Woodworth, Thorndike, 
and others to question the dogma of the image and to show 
that thought processes may go on independently of imagery 
—or, indeed, even independently of peripherally initiated 
processes. To this last contention we do not accede, as 
we shall undertake later to show. (2) The failure on the 
part of the most earnest upholders of the doctrine of the 
centrally aroused sensation to obtain any objective experi- 
mental evidence of the presence of different image-types. 
Reference here is made to the researches of Angell and of 
_ Fernald. Although these writers in no way suggest such a 
conclusion, it seems to us that the way is paved, by reason 
of their findings, for the complete dismissal of the image 
from psychology. Furthermore, most psychologists them- 
selves are willing to admit that introspection furnishes no 
guide for the determination of one’s own image-type. In 
this field, above all others, introspection, if it is a legitimate 
method at all, ought to yield its best results. It is just here 
that it has failed, except in the case of a few fortunate men 
who seem to have become ‘‘ adept ’’ in the use of it. We 
who are less happy in its use must forever do without this 
wonderful Aladdin’s lamp, which, upon demand, illumines 
the dark places of the human mind. (3) The attempts even 
of the structuralists to reduce the so-called higher thought 
processes to groups of obscure organic processes. We have 
in mind the recent work on recognition, abstraction, ete. 
All of these tendencies, initiated by the psychologists 
themselves, lead directly over to our principal contention, 
viz., that there are no centrally initiated processes.® 
The environment in the widest sense forces the forma- 
*There are probably in most cases kinesthetic substitutes for 
imagery. Concurrently with the faintly articulated word apple there 
arise associated kinesthetic impulses in eye muscles. If these latter 
are strong one can see how the fiction of visual imagery might arise. 
Mead has already spoken for the existence of a strong tactual and 
kinesthetic element (grasping, handling, etc.) in all forms of per- 
ception and in imagery. Dunlap has rejected the centrally aroused 
content in the image.

tion of habits. These are exhibited first in the organs 
which are most mobile: the arms, hands, fingers, legs, etc. 
By this we do not mean to imply that there is any fixed 
order in their formation. After such general bodily habits 
are well under way, speech habits begin. All of the recent 
work shows that these reach enormous complexity in a com- 
paratively short time. Furthermore, as language habits 
become more and more complex behavior takes on refine- 
ment: short cuts are formed, and finally words come to be, 
on occasion, substituted for acts. That is, a stimulus which, 
in early stages, would produce an act (and which will 
always do so under appropriate conditions) now produces 
merely a spoken word or a mere movement of the larynx 
(or of some other expressive organ).7 
‘When the stimulus produces either an immediate overt 
response (as, e.g., when John is told to go to the side- 
board and get an apple—taking it for granted that he goes), 
or a delayed overt response (as, e.g., when an engineer is 
asked to think out and make an apparatus for the conver- 
sion of salt water into sweet, which may consume years 
before overt action begins), we have examples of what we 
may call explicitbehavior. In contrast to behavior of 
this type, which invalves’the larger musculature in a way 
plainly apparent to direct observation, we have behavior 
involving only the speech mechanisms (or the larger 
musculature in a minimal way; e.g., bodily attitudes or 
sets). This form of behavior, for lack of a better name, 
we may call implictt—behavior® Where explicit behavior 
is delayed (i., where deliberation ensues), the interven- 
ing time between stimulus and response is given over to 
implicit behavior (to ‘‘ thought processes ’’). 
Now it is this type of implicit behavior that the intro- 
spectionist claims as his own and denies to us because its 
neural seat is cortical and because it goes on without ade- 
quate bodily portrayal. Why in) psychology the stage for

of behavior referred to throughout this book are acquired and not 
congenital.

the neural drama was ever transferred from periphery to 
cortex must remain somewhat of a mystery. The old idea 
of strict localization of brain function is in part responsible. 
Religious convictions are even more largely responsible for 
it. It is not meant by this that the men originally making 
the transfer were aware of this religious tendency at all. 
‘When the psychologist threw away the soul he compromised 
with his conscience by setting up a ‘‘ mind ’”’ which was to 
remain always hidden and difficult of access.®° The transfer 
from periphery to cortex has been the incentive for driving 
psychology into vain and fruitless searches for the unknown 
and unknowable. Had the idea of the image not taken 
such firm hold upon us we would never have originated 
the notion that we are seeking to explain consciousness. 
‘We would have been content to study the very tangible 
phenomena of the growth and control of explicit and 
implicit habits. 
It is implied in these words that there exists or ought to 
exist a method of observing implicit behavior. There is 
none at present. The larynx and tongue, we believe, are the 
loci of most of the phenomena. If their movements could 
be adequately portrayed we should obtain a record similar 
to that of the phonogram. Certainly nothing so definite 
as this could be obtained, but we should get a record, at 
least, which would largely reveal the subject’s word-habits, 
which, if we are not mistaken, make up the bulk of the 
implicit forms of behavior.?° 
* The tendency to make the brain itself something more than a 
mechanism for coérdinating incoming and outgoing impulses has been 
very strong among psychologists, and even among psychologically in- 
clined neurologists. A still wilder hypothesis is held in regard to the 
neural impulse. According to many psychologists we are taught that 
an incoming impulse may be held in statu quo for long periods of 
time, or at least that it may ramble around in the nervous system 
for an indefinite period of time—until it can “obtain possession of 
the motor field,” at which time it exerts its effect. So far as we know 
no such thing occurs. The nervous system functions in complete ares. 
An incoming impulse exerts its effect relatively immediately upon one 
system of effectors or another, as shown by inhibition, reinforcement, 
summation, phenomena in the muscle in operation, or _by inciting 
wholly new effectors to activity.

  AFFECTION AS BEHAVIOR 21 
Now it is admitted by all of us that words spoken or 
faintly articulated belong really in the realm of behavior 
as do movements of the arms and legs. If implicit be- 
havior can be shown to consist of nothing but word move- 
ments (or expressive movements of the word-type) the 
behavior of the human being as a whole is as open to 
objective control as the behavior of the lowest organism. 
| Affection as a form of instinctive behavior.—Affection 
is the other stumbling-block in the way of our main thesis. 
It is needless for us to enter into a lengthy discussion of 
the various views of affection. It is sufficient to call at- 
tention to the generally accepted position that affection 
is a mental process distinct from cognition. Both Angell 
and Titchener in this country admit the independence of 
the two. In Germany likewise, with the exception of the 
followers of Stumpf, the independence is admitted. In- 
deed, as it is well known, Wundt and his pupils are at- 
tempting to introduce into affection the same wealth of 
detail they have already succeeded in bringing into cogni- 
tion. We refer to the addition to the elementary processes of 
pleasure-pain, those of strain-relaxation, excitement-calm. 
In maintaining his position as to the independence of the 
two processes, Titchener states that affection and sensation 
are closely similar in the following respects. Both possess 
certain common attributes, viz., quality, intensity, duration. 
Sensation possesses the additional attribute of clearness, 
which affection lacks. ‘‘ The lack of the attribute of clear- 
ness is sufficient in itself to differentiate affection from 
sensation; a process that cannot be made the object of 
attention is radically different, and must play a radically 
different part in consciousness, from a process which is 
held and enhanced by attention.’’ Furthermore, the lack 
of clearness distinguishes affection from organic sensation 
—the cognitive processes with which it is most closely allied. 
On the whole, while sensation and affection are closely 
allied, ‘‘ the difference is so great that we have no choice 
but to rank affection in human psychology as a second type 
of mental element, distinct from sensation.’’ 
Adherents of the view that affection is merely an attri-
-P-A-G-E-36
22 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
bute of sensation have not been lacking. Kiilpe has been 
given credit for demolishing this assumption. 
There remains the view in contrast to the one first out- 
lined, advanced principally by Stumpf and accepted and 
amended by Helen Thompson Woolley, viz., that affection 
is really organic sensation. The theory as advanced by 
Stumpf is all but unintelligible in view of the fact that the 
simplification that he obtains by his reduction is more than 
offset by the complexity he introduces when he states that 
the emotions, in addition to the complex of sensations, con- 
tain a mysterious ‘‘ kernel.’’ Mrs. Woolley, while rejecting 
the ‘‘ kernel ’’ hypothesis, insists that affection can be 
identified with sensation. She gives no clear reason for 
the solidarity and distinctness of the two groups, nor for 
the rather constant presence of the one or the other of these 
two groups. Stumpf no more than she meets these two 
points. 
The Stumpf-Woolley view may be modified and stated 
in more definite terms. Every stimulus which calls out 
either overt or delayed response arouses concomitantly 
(reflexly) a definite and complex group of afferent impulses 
from tissue not specified definitely by the authors. We 
assume that the tissue in question belongs to the reproduc- 
tive organs and to the related erogenous zones. The area 
involved in sex functions embraces a much wider zone 
than that of the sex organs proper. The erogenous zones 
are in infancy widely distributed throughout the body sur- 
faces. Only gradually does the sex organ come to be looked 
upon as the focus of sex experience. Even in the case of 
most adults certain of these primitive zones remain func- 
tional, as, e.g., the nipples, ete. 
This area as a whole may be looked upon as initiating 
impulses of two fundamental kinds: (1) a group connected 
with tumescence and rhythmical contractions of other 
muscular tissue and with increases in the quantity of the 
various secretions. This group, if functioning alone, as it 
does in cases of sex response, would lead to the expansive 
or seeking movements, and ultimately to the unfolding of 
the instinctive mechanism of the act of reproduction (end-
-P-A-G-E-37
AFFECTION AS BEHAVIOR 23 
ing in the orgasm). (2) A group connected with the 
shrinkage of the sex organs, relaxation of other muscular 
tissue, and with inhibition of secretion. These impulses, 
gaining the motor centers, would, if no others inhibitory in 
character were present, release movements of avoidance. 
In order to bring this conception of the sensory character 
of affection in line with our general scheme, it is necessary 
to suppose that the impulses from the erotic tissues func- 
tion as do the impulses arising from other receptors, i.e., 
looking at it from a neurological standpoint, there is a 
definite system of reflex ares running from these regions 
(both enteroceptive and proprioceptive impulses are in- 
volved) to the muscles. This, as far as we know, is thor- 
oughly established. In order to illustrate the point, let 
us take the neurophysiological situation at the moment of 
sex excitement. 
When a definite sex object (female) appeals to any one 
receptor, the eye, the ear, or the nose of the animal, grant- 
ing a certain physiological condition of the animal (i.e., 
the proper season of the year, period of sex excitement, 
etc.: in general, since seasonal rhythms are not so marked 
in the male, the animal must be in a receptive condition for 
such stimuli), several sets of arcs. begin to function: (a) 
one leading from the distance receptor (aroused by the sex 
object) to the striped muscles, tending to produce a 
heightened tonus in the skeletal muscles. Movements in 
the striped muscles do not become overt until definite im- 
pulses are sent in from the sex zones. When these are 
present with sufficient intensity, overt seeking movements 
begin. The impulses from the sex zones are aroused by 
the second set of ares: the initial impulse aroused by the 
sex object while arousing tonus in the striped muscle (b) 
passes out (via the white rami) also to the appropriate 
sympathetic ganglia. When these neurones are stimulated, 
changes are produced in the circulatory, glandular, 
secretory and muscular mechanisms, possibly of the char- 
acter described in (1) above, p. 22. As soon as these 
effectors are thrown into activity they set up a character- 
istic group of afferent impulses (they represent a definite
-P-A-G-E-38
24 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
set of bodily reverberations, to use William James’ term, 
and hence in current psychological terminology they are 
the bodily substrata of the emotion of pleasantness), which 
upon reaching the motor centers, produce the actual seek- 
ing movements in the striped muscles. When the situation 
is prolonged, i.e., when definite receptors other than the 
initial one become stimulated by the sex object by reason 
- of the seeking movements, the complete act of reproduction 
follows. On the other hand, if the general physiological 
condition is different (organism not receptive to sex 
stimuli) there again arise (a) an increased tonus in the 
striped muscles and (b) activity in the sympathetic 
mechanisms, checking of secretion, lack of tonicity in the 
muscles, ete., which arouse, in turn, a definite group of 
afferent impulses (‘‘ bodily substrata of unpleasantness ’’) 
that tends definitely to set free the avoiding reaction. Since 
the mechanisms involved in sex are fundamental, it seems 
reasonable to suppose that every object, either instinctively 
or through habit, tends to throw them into the one or the 
other form of action, of which we have just spoken.1 
Certainly many objects (non-affective stimuli, stimuli 
11 In fact we see no escape from such a conclusion, if the Stumpf- 
Woolley hypothesis is adopted. By its own admission, this theory 
must be able to account for several so-called observed facts. We state 
them from the standpoint of current psychology. 
That there should be two well-marked and opposite groups. 
That they always accompany perceptions or images. 
That they are evanescent and hard to observe (Titchener says 
they cannot be “ observed”). 
That the image carries its own tone which need not be, and 
often is not, the same as that given in the original perception. 
That there should at times be neutral perceptions and images, 
and that tone tends to disappear with frequency of appearance 
of the stimulating object. 
Were we interested in arguing for a structural psychology, we 
could readily show how 1, 2, 4, and 5 follow immediately from our 
premises. In regard to 3, it could be said (1) that evanescence would 
be the character expected in all cases except that of direct sex stimula- 
tion, since these ares are functioning only slightly along with the ares 
from distance receptors to voluntary muscles, which are functioning 
at high intensity. Titchener’s statement that they cannot be attended 
to is a pure assumption in the interests of a structural criterion. 
Pathological cases tend to support the view that at certain times 
affective processes. or, on this view, affective sensations, are often the 
only sensations which are attended to,

distantly or not at all connected with sex stimuli) do not, 
in the beginning, arouse these groups, but through the 
ordinary mechanism of habit come later to arouse faintly 
the one or the other (substitution, p. 272). There is 
evidence in sexual pathology ‘to show not only that such 
habit connections are formed, but also that they can be- 
come more fundamental than the primal instinctive path- 
ways, as is shown in the use of phallic symbols, fetishes, ete. 
We thus seem to be able to connect so-called affective 
processes definitely with general processes of adjustment. 
Behavior, while possibly not immediately interested in such 
processes, need not escape its share of work in their study. 
On the one hand, the student of behavior, when some of the 
more pressing problems are solved, will be interested in the 
types of stimuli which jointly arouse movements in the 
striped muscles and in the unstriped muscles and glandular 
tissues in the sex zones, and in the finer analysis of the 
movements themselves. He will try to determine whether 
such stimuli arouse these movements by means of inherent 
connections or through habit. Furthermore, he will try to 
determine whether the movements of the glands, ete., actu- 
ally set up sensory impulses in the sexual zones, and whether 
they have the effect called for upon his theory. This can be 
attacked in two ways: (1) probably by actual plethysmo- 
graphic and galvanometrie studies upon the sex organs 
themselves; (2) by the elimination of the sensory avenues 
which lead from these zones to the central system. His 
primary interest, however, will be engaged in determining 
the effect of these impulses upon overt movement, since it 
is highly probable that they are responsible for so-called 
preferences, which play such an enormous role in the 
daily life of the human being, and for the many forms of 
artistic, esthetic, and religious modes of response. To 
those who have inherent objections to admitting that the 
wsthetic, artistic, and religious sides of life are at bottom 
sexual, this view will not sound convincing. Fortunately, 
thanks to the work of the scientific students of social 
phenomena we are fast losing our prejudices against admit- 
ting the sex reference of all behavior, 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
26 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
It must be confessed that wholly new methods will have 
to be devised for the pursuit of studies in this field. There 
is still hope, as was suggested above, for galvanometric 
and plethysmographic experimentation. You may object 
that expressive methods have already failed to show any 
constant physiological processes occurring in conjunction 
with the examination of ‘‘ pleasant ’’ and ‘‘ unpleasant ’’ 
objects. We have worked for years upon the expressive 
methods and no one is more ready to admit their failure 
in the past. Our present feeling is that we have taken our 
plethysmograms from the wrong organs. Whether there 
are too many technical difficulties in the way of the objec- 
tive registration of the many delicate changes in the sex 
organs (circulation, secretion, etc.) remains for the future 
to decide. 
The result of our examination into the nature of both 
image and affection seems to indicate that after all the be- 
haviorist can bring them into his general scheme of work 
without in any way weakening his position. It would thus 
seem that there is no field which an introspective psy- 
chology legitimately can call its own. 
Will there be left over in psychology a world of pure 
psychics, to use Yerkes’ term? The plans which we most 
favor for psychology lead practically to the ignoring of 
consciousness in the sense in which that term is used by 
psychologists today. We have virtually denied that this 
realm of psychics is open to experimental investigation. 
We do not wish to go further into the problem because its 
future rests with the metaphysician. If you will grant the 
behaviorist the right to use consciousness in the same way 
that other natural scientists employ it—i.e., without making 
consciousness a special object of observation—you have 
granted all that our thesis requires. 
Summary.—1. Human psychology has failed to make 
good its claim as a natural science. Due to a mistaken 
notion that its fields of facts are conscious phenomena and 
that introspection is the only direct method of ascertaining 
these facts, it has enmeshed itself in a series of speculative 
questions which, while fundamental to its present tenets,
-P-A-G-E-41
  U 
SUMMARY 27 
are not open to experimental treatment. In the pursuit of 
answers to these questions, it has become further and fur- 
ther divorced from contact with problems which vitally 
concern human interest. 
2. Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely 
objective, experimental branch of natural science which 
needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry 
and physics. It is granted that the behavior of animals 
can be investigated without appeal to consciousness. 
Heretofore the viewpoint has been that such data have value 
only in so far as they can be interpreted by analogy in 
terms of consciousness. The position is taken here that the 
behavior of man and the behavior of animals must be 
considered on the same plane; as being equally essential to 
a general understanding of behavior. It can dispense with 
consciousness in a psychological sense. The separate ob- 
servation of ‘‘ states of consciousness ”’ is, on this assump- 
tion, no more a part of the task of the psychologist than of 
the physicist. We might call this the return to a non-re- 
flective and naive use of consciousness. In this sense 
consciousness may be said to be the instrument or tool with 
which all scientists work. Whether or not the tool is 
properly used at present by scientists is a problem for 
philosophy and not for psychology. 
3. From the viewpoint here suggested the facts on the 
behavior of amcebe have value in and for themselves 
without reference to the behavior of man. In biology 
studies on race differentiation and inheritance in amebe 
form a separate division of study which must be evaluated 
in terms of the laws found there. The conclusions so 
reached may not hold in any other form. Regardless of 
the possible lack of generality, such studies must be made 
if evolution as a whole is ever to be regulated and con- 
trolled. Similarly the laws of behavior in amcebe, the 
range of responses, and the determination of, effective 
stimuli, of habit formation, persistency of habits, inter- 
ference and reinforcement of habits, must be determined 
and evaluated in and for themselves, regardless of their 
generality, or of their bearing upon such laws in other
-P-A-G-E-42
    28 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR 
forms, if the phenomena of behavior are ever to be brought 
within the sphere of scientific control. 
4. This suggested elimination of states of consciousness 
as proper objects of investigation in themselves will remove 
the barrier which exists between psychology and the other 
sciences. The findings of psychology become the func- 
tional correlates of structure and lend themselves to ex- 
planation in physico-chemical terms. 
5. Psychology as behavior will, after all, have to neglect 
but few of the really essential problems with which psy- 
chology as an introspective science now concerns itself. In 
all probability even this residue of problems may be 
phrased in such a way that refined methods in behavior 
(which certainly must come) will lead to their solution.

No lack of unity in the problems of behavior.—In the 
preceding discussion of the relation of behavior to psy- 
chology several problems which face the behaviorist were 
touched upon. In the present chapter the attempt is made 
to develop them in such a way that their unity may be 
traced. At the present time behavior appears to the casual 
observer to consist of a large number of rather isolated bits 
of research which may be classified here and there under 
sciences already well recognized. This is a serious mistake 
and one which will handicap advance in this subject in the 
years to come. The sketch of the problems given below 
may be looked upon as a program for unified and sys- 
29
-P-A-G-E-44
  30 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
tematic work rather than as a complete expression of the 
scope and aim of behavior. Even such an immature and 
hasty sketch of the problems confronting us will, it is hoped, 
offer convincing evidence that the work of the behaviorist, 
while closely related to that of the zodlogist and the physi- 
ologist, is, nevertheless, independent. 
Field versus laboratory studies.—Before presenting the 
special groups of problems of behavior, it is necessary to 
face one criticism often urged against the young science, 
viz., that of the narrowness of its problems. In the last 
few years behavior has become mainly a laboratory science. 
This has led a large number of men who have devoted their 
lives to the field activity of animals, such as Burroughs, 
Wesley Mills, and a wide group of naturalists, to say that 
the laboratory is not a suitable place in which to study 
behavior. According to them only highly specialized prob- 
lems can be attacked in the laboratories. True and un- 
trammeled expressions of habit and instinct and of the 
uses of the senses must be sought for in the field activity 
of animals. Unquestionably it is a mistake to neglect field 
work. It requires no lengthy argument to show that gen- 
eral orientation with respect to the daily routine of 
adjustments of animals and an accurate knowledge of the 
environmental conditions under which animals live can 
come only through field observation. No one who has ever 
used monkeys as subjects can help feeling how handicapped 
we are at the present time in our laboratory studies of 
simian life through lack of systematic knowledge of their 
life in the open. What is true in the case of the primates 
is true with respect to nearly every other animal form. It 
is highly improbable that any of us could describe in a 
really helpful way the daily routine of the domestic fowl 
or the dog. We are even less familiar with the seasonal 
routine of animals, such as hibernation, migration, ete. On 
the other hand, it can hardly be claimed that mere observa- 
tion of field activity, even when made by competent 
students, can ever hope to answer in any scientific way the 
basal questions which must be asked about the mechanics 
of stimulus and response. Even the most superficial ob-
-P-A-G-E-45
  
  FIELD OBSERVATION 31 
servation of field activity by the trained student raises at 
once a host of questions, the answers to which must be 
sought in the laboratory—is the cat visually stimulated 
by a moving object in steadily decreasing intensity of light 
for a longer time than the human being, or does this animal 
stalk its prey after it is lost to sight through a highly de- 
veloped sense of smell? Do the birds which feed upon 
decaying animal matter sense it through smell or sight? A 
few minutes’ observation will show that while many of our 
problems are raised in the field, the scientific answers to 
them come through the laboratories. But granting the in- 
dispensableness of the laboratory, it is well, after finishing 
with our animal, to observe him yet again in the field. 
One can readily conceive of some such situation as the 
following :—after years of analytical study upon the tem- 
perature, visual, olfactory, and auditory senses of a given 
species of bird, one might predict the utter absurdity of 
that bird’s being able-to get back to its home when carried 
out to sea for a distance of one thousand miles. Yet on 
specific test we find the bird able to do this. Of course our 
laboratory study was incomplete, or we should have been 
able to predict what actually happened. Yet the incom- 
pleteness of the laboratory study would be discovered only 
when we, so to speak, began to put the bird together again! 
Without developing the subject further, it would seem 
obvious that there is no conflict between field work and 
laboratory work. The field is both the source of problems 
and the place where the laboratory solutions of these prob- 
lems are tested. 
Grouping of problems.—The vast majority of the prob- 
lems in both human and animal behavior may be grouped 
under one or another of three divisions: I. Sense organ 
functions. II. Instinctive functions. III. Habit forma- 
tion. In addition to these large divisions in which the 
subjects for research lie, there remains the work of, IV. 
Correlation: first, among behavior data—giving both an 
ontogeny and a phylogeny of behavior; second, of behavior 
with structure; and finally the correlation of behavior and 
structure with physico-chemical processes. We shall take 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  32 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
up these divisions separately and attempt to show in some 
detail what special questions gather around them. Later 
we shall discuss the apparatus and methods which are 
employed in attempting to return answers to them. 
I. Sense-Orcan Processes 
Introduction.—The study of sense functions should come 
prior, logically, to the study of either instinct or learning, 
since neither instinctive action nor learning can be thor- 
oughly understood until we have definite knowledge about 
the sense processes of the animal under experimentation. 
In actual practice, work upon instinct, learning, and the 
sense organs has been carried forward simultaneously. It 
is very difficult to study any one of these subjects by itself. 
In the learning of mazes and puzzle boxes both by animals 
and human beings, many facts appear which are of impor- 
tance to a study of instincts and senses. On the other 
hand, our knowledge of sense-organ processes is obtained 
in two ways: (1) by forcing the animal to form sensory 
habits (p. 187) ; and (2) by noting the inherited modes of 
response to controlled stimuli. In the study of the spectral 
sensibility of the chick (limits) one finds that the chick is 
positive to light, ie., will go towards a lighted compart- 
ment from the first, without learning. The relations among 
these three divisions seem at first sight to be too complicated 
for analytical work. It will be seen from the chapters that 
follow that the difficulties are more apparent than real. 
1. Vision 
Necessity for consideration of anatomical structure.— 
Before making an extensive study of vision in any par- 
ticular animal form, it is essential to study carefully the 
structure of its eye and the visual conduction systems; 
and to have at least some knowlédge of the animal’s general 
anatomy. Questions as to the presence or absence of a 
. fovea; whether both rods and cones are present, and their 
distribution ; whether the animal has the essential structure
-P-A-G-E-47
  PROBLEMS IN VISION 33 
for binocular vision; whether there are accommodation, 
convergence, and divergence—are met at every turn in 
our work. Not to have orientation with respect to them 
means a lack of thoroughness in the setting of problems 
for the study of vision. It is equally essential (where 
possible) to make a study of the animal’s visual environ- 
ment and of the field habits and instincts which seem to 
depend upon visual stimuli: 
Reflex responses to light.—In the observations of the 
movements of lower forms of plants and animals, one is 
often struck by the remarkable sensitivity of some of the 
organisms—Euglena, Stentor,—and by the equally notice- 
able lack of sensitivity in other forms, e.g., Paramecium. 
The general responsiveness to light is equally observable 
in the higher animals as well. The tern remains absolutely 
quiescent in total’ darkness. The chick’s behavior on the 
sudden elimination of light is equally remarkable. It re- 
mains at first quite still, as though stunned, and then be- 
gins aimlessi' movements,—pecking, turning, running 
against objects, etc. The rats, and probably other rodents 
as well, require separate laboratory work in order to tell 
whether vision is functional at all. Vision seems to func- 
tion in‘':some animals (nocturnal animals) only in very 
weakened intensity of light, strong light producing cessa- 
tion of activity equally as well as absolute darkness. 
General divisions of problems in vision.—The problems 
in vision proper may be considered under (a) white light 
vision; (b) monochromatic light vision; (c) the rdle 
of vision in daily life (mutual relations among the 
senses) . 
White light vision.—(a) One of the first problems in 
white light vision is the determination of the delicacy of 
the mechanism. What absolute intensity of light can the 
animal respond ‘to with dark adapted eye, and with light 
adapted eye? What difference in intensity between two 
lights is it necessary to maintain in order to give a basis 
for a differential response? (Weber’s law.) Are re- 
sponses to light positive or negative? Under what condi- 
tions may a positive tendency be changed to a negative?
-P-A-G-E-48
34 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
Can it be so changed in any of the vertebrates without in- 
volving habit formation? We are led over almost at once 
into a consideration of darkness and light adaptation in 
animals with cone retine and in those possessing rod 
retin, the difference in the response to white light be- 
tween animals with image forming eyes and those with eye 
structures too undeveloped to form images. Another for- 
ward step in the work on vision is the determination of the 
animal’s behavior with respect to form and size, vertical 
and horizontal lines, moving and stationary stimuli, pat- 
terns, ete. é 
Response to monochromatic light.—The difficulty of 
gaining accurate knowledge of animals’ monochromatic 
light responses is very great. Heretofore the work has 
been carried out by methods and apparatus which can 
never yield accurate results. The first step in the study of 
any animal’s color responses should be the determination 
of the limits of its spectral sensitivity. The second step 
should be the determination of the energy of stimulus 
necessary to yield threshold responses at various points 
in the spectrum. Enough places should be chosen to 
enable the experimenter to plot the sensitivity curve 
throughout the spectrum. This threshold curve will serve 
in several connections. In the first place it enables us 
to say immediately whether both lights used in the work 
_ on sensory habits lie above the animal’s threshold, and con- 
sequently whether both are effective stimuli. We have 
learned the necessity for this after the loss of several 
months’ work. In the second place it will largely increase 
our knowledge of the variations of intensity which it is nec- 
essary to make the monochromatic lights undergo in order to 
test for sensitivity to wave-length difference (color vision). 
Let us illustrate: suppose we have found that even at our 
standard intensity the red has very little stimulating effect 
upon the animal, ie., that it is only slightly above its 
threshold. Now if one is confronting the animal with red 
and green it is perfectly evident that if we cut down the 
intensity of the red in only a small degree, it will cease to 
stimulate the visual receptors. This is only one of the
-P-A-G-E-49
PROBLEMS IN VISION 35 
features which make it desirable to obtain the limits of 
the spectrum and the sensibility curve for the animal whose 
vision we wish to study at length. The next step, logically, 
in the monochromatic light work, is the careful working 
through of the Weber law for intensity at several points 
in the spectrum. Our interest is not psychophysical here 
but methodological. We need to know for subsequent con- 
trol of behavior, what difference in intensity one has to 
maintain between two reds of the same wave-length in 
order to afford a basis for a difference in response. The 
problem is simple enough in technique, as will be shown 
on p. 357. One allows a given bundle, red, for purposes 
of illustration, to come from the spectrum. This is then 
divided by means of a double image prism into two beams 
equal in intensity. The intensities are then controlled 
separately by means of smoked wedges (or rotating sectors). 
The tests on the animal are carried forward in exactly the 
same way as in tests on sensitivity to wave-length differ- 
ence. The tests should naturally be repeated with different 
absolute intensities. The Weber-Fechner law may or may 
not hold. Regardless of the bearing of the work upon that 
law we will gain a clearer insight than we now have of the 
relative stimulating value of the different colors at low, 
intermediate, and high intensities. The results of these 
experiments upon differences in intensity should aid us in 
testing the possibility of response to differences in wave- 
lengths, which is the most difficult problem in animal vision. 
Since this problem is already well known, we leave a further 
discussion of it to p. 356 ff., where the results of tests on 
color vision are considered. : 
Finally, as a means of controlling visual response it is 
essential to test the relative effects of decreasing the in- 
tensity of light by the four different methods usually em- 
ployed: (1) distancing the source of the light; (2) thinning 
the beam by the use of diaphragms; (3) by the use of the 
rotating sector; (4) absorption by means of smoked (neu- 
tral) wedges. As is well known, careful experiments have 
shown that in the human being it is a matter of indiffer- 
ence (Talbot’s law) which method is used. This cannot
-P-A-G-E-50
36 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
be assumed to be true in the case of animals. This work 
should best be undertaken with monochromatic light. 
2. Audition 
Grouping of problems.—The problems in sound may be 
grouped under three general headings: (1) response to 
pendular vibrations; (2) to a-periodie vibrations; (3) to 
the ordinary sounds in the animal’s environment (tates, 
other animals, etc.). 
(1) Response to pendular vibrations.—As in the case of 
vision, so in audition, field observations ought to guide us 
in making our audition tests. We can do little more 
here than to enumerate the various problems which lie be- 
fore us. 
(a) Range of sensitivity—The animal’s range of sen- 
sitivity. to simple pendular vibrations is probably the most 
fundamental problem in this field. The work can be car- 
ried, out with good forks by forcing the formation of sen- 
sory habits. The method of making these tests is described 
on p. 81. The tests should be combined with threshold 
tests and with others designed to bring out differential 
sensitivity both with respect to pitch and to intensity. 
While there is no convenient standard of intensity at pres- 
ent, it is possible for the work to be carried out upon differ- 
ent animals in the same laboratory with the same apparatus. 
We can obtain in this way values which are strictly com- 
parable for the different animals. Such work is, however, 
not reproducible in other laboratories unless some system 
of exchanging apparatus is adopted. 
(b) Localization—The localization of sound stimuli (in 
the case of bodies which give periodic and those which 
give a-periodic vibrations) is important both for obtaining 
knowledge of the experimental range of auditory sensitivity 
and for tests of the function of sound in the daily life of 
the animal. 
(c) Response to clangs.—The question as to the ability 
of the animal to respond to differences in the timbre of 
sound complexes (analysis of chords) has an interesting 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  PROBLEMS IN AUDITION 37 
bearing upon the nature of structural relations in the inner 
ear (complexity demanded in organ of Corti). 
(2) Response to a-periodic vibrations: (a) Stimulus 
threshold.—The falling ball (some standard apparatus 
should be chosen) gives us the best means of testing stimulus 
thresholds. The tests would be very easy to carry out. It 
is surprising that this work has never been attempted. 
(b) Difference threshold—The differential sensitivity 
for sound intensity should likewise be worked out with a 
similar instrument, but in this case the problem is more 
difficult, since two stimuli must be employed. The tests of 
response to periodic and a-periodie vibrations are designed 
to give us the experimental range of auditory functions, 
and not the practical range employed in daily life. The 
problems which follow are connected with the practical 
range. 
(3) Response to the ordinary sounds in its environment 
(mates, other animals, etc.) : (a) Instinctive repertoire of 
sounds.—The instinctive repertoire of vocalization is im- 
‘portant, if for no other reason than to guard ourselves 
against those enthusiastic but untrained investigators who 
would tell us that animals have a language. It is possible 
to obtain this instinctive repertoire only by isolating the 
animal until the native vocalizations have all been recorded, 
and then comparing the vocalizations of the isolated animal 
with those of an animal brought up in company with its 
fellows. 
(b) Modification of vocal sounds through social influ- 
ence.—The extent to which such vocalizations are modifi- 
able by social surroundings may be illustrated by the work 
of Conradi, who reared English sparrows with canaries,— 
certainly with no hardship to the voice of the sparrows 
(p. 143). As a part of (b) we include the problem of find- 
ing to what extent animals can be made to respond cor- 
rectly to articulate sounds made by the human being (note 
the behavior of the dog, Jasper; the chimpanzee, Peter, 
and of other highly trained animals, p. 299). 
(c) Influence of such sounds upon activity of mates.— 
The extent to which animals are induced to engage in com-
-P-A-G-E-52
38 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
mon activities by the voice of the mate, parent or com- 
panion (sex activity, feeding, flight, etc.). While these 
problems possibly may have the flavor of the ‘‘ manufac- 
tured ’’ or laboratory variety, a little field observation will 
quickly show that they are really fundamental. Hodge 
would have us believe that the deer has an almost unbeliev- 
ably acute sense of hearing. How can we dispute it or 
confirm it in the deer or any other animal until we have 
made threshold tests under standard conditions? Kalischer 
tells us of the absolute pitch memory of dogs. Who can 
prove it or disprove it except by the laboratory type of 
test? Until these exact and rigorous tests are made and 
repeatedly confirmed by several investigators it is impos- 
sible to carry forward research upon the localization of 
pitch centers, experimentation upon the functions of the 
cochlea, and the like. 
3. Olfaction and Gustation 
Lack of definite knowledge of smell functions.—It is 
singular that the functions of the organ of smell have 
never been investigated in any complete way in any ver- 
tebrate. Several investigations have been carried out upon 
smell in birds and in fishes. These tests have had as their 
object the determination of the fact whether those animals 
use that receptor. Of the range and complexity of its 
uses we have nothing. That enormous differences exist 
among the smell functions of different animals there is 
little room for doubt. In addition to the problems con- 
nected with the general functioning of the organ of smell, 
there are many concerning the instinctive life of the animal 
which have never been explored. We have in mind here 
the positive reactions made to certain ‘‘ nauseous ”’ smell 
stimuli, and to the apparent lack of sensitivity to the odor of 
flowers and perfumes generally, ete. The human being 
seems to be the only animal which responds negatively to 
the class of odors which Zwaardemaker calls nauseous. 
1K. §. Lashley finds that an Amazon parrot in his possession will 
vomit at the smell of an old pipe (Class VI).
-P-A-G-E-53
  OLFACTION AND GUSTATION 39 
How much of this is due to social training and how much 
to fundamental biological tendencies is not known. From 
the study of primitive Australian tribes and from bio- 
logical studies generally the conclusions seem to follow that 
social conventions and training are responsible for the 
negative tendencies which are so apparent in man. Still, 
the evidence is not completely decisive. Certain smells in 
the cultivated European are connected with definite re- 
flexes: nausea and even vomiting being produced. That 
our ignorance of smell! functions in general is almost colossal 
comes out clearly when we try to compare even in thought 
the delicacy of the average human being’s sense of smell 
with that of certain varieties of dogs. Hunting dogs, blood- 
hounds, ete., must have an almost unbelievably delicate 
sense of smell. Yet when defective human beings have been 
forced to depend upon this sense, they have surprised us 
by the delicacy with which they use this organ. It is diffi- 
eult even in field work to detect the actual uses to which 
smell is put by animals. In the case of the monkey it is 
quite clear that objects are rejected by this sense long before 
they reach the mouth. That olfactory stimuli start seeking 
movements in many vertebrate forms is also clear. The spe- 
cifie problems in smell are much like those in the other sense 
fields. There is need of field observations to guide us in 
setting problems for determining the interrelations of smell 
with other sense functions, and the réle smell plays in the 
daily life of the animal. As in vision and in audition we 
need to test the animal’s range of sensitivity. For this 
problem the best plan of attack would probably be that 
of taking several odors from each of Zwaardemaker’s nine 
classes and testing in order whether the animal is positive 
or negative to them. Either form of response, provided 
proper controls were introduced, would show that that 
odor was an effective stimulus. If no such simple inherited 
mode of response were present we should attempt to force 
the formation of a sensory habit which would enable us to 
determine whether the odor lies within the animal’s range. 
Extended experiments would be necessary for the determi- 
nation of threshold intensities of different olfactory stimuli.
-P-A-G-E-54
  40 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
We shall sketch a method farther on (p. 89) by means of 
which such tests may be started at least with some hopes 
of results. 
Function of olfaction in habit formation.—The extent 
to which smell stimuli influence the formation of habits in 
the daily life of most of the vertebrates is at present un- 
known. It is generally believed that smell forms the center 
of reference for most animals. What tests have been made 
do not confirm this. That smell data are utilized in habit 
would seem to be clear from the anecdotal literature, and 
yet in many of the tests on the formation of motor habits we 
have been enabled to eliminate this sense without decreasing 
the rapidity with which learning takes place. 
Problems in gustation—Gustation offers as its main 
problems: (a) the ability of animals to react differently 
to sapid substances either instinctively or through habit; 
(b) the delicacy of the organ in detecting taste substances 
in solution (and at a distance), and (c) the localization of 
the taste organs. The sense of taste offers a more inviting 
field to students of lower vertebrate and invertebrate be- 
havior than to those engaged in work upon birds and 
mammals. 
4. Cutaneous, Proprio- and Entero-ceptive Systenis. 
Difficulties in the way of making satisfactory tests.— 
We experience great difficulty in making tests upon the tac- 
tual, kinesthetic, organic, and other internal systems of 
receptors. Some interesting work has been done in all of 
these fields, but we have not gone far enough in such in- 
vestigations to talk very intelligently about the problems. 
Work here calls almost instantly for operative technique. 
Proprio-ceptive system.—The maze experiments and 
those on the so-called delayed reaction (pp. 99 and 104) 
have been the most effective ones so far in yielding results. 
There still remains a very large number of problems in con- 
nection with the maze. The disturbance which results from 
rotating the maze after the animal has learned it is a case in 
point (p. 219). Many observers have noted this phenom-
-P-A-G-E-55
  INTERNAL RECEPTORS 41 
enon. While it may possibly be explained in terms of the 
change in the balance which exists among the processes in 
the distance receptors, it may be due, on the other hand, to a 
change in the functioning of some of the internal receptors, 
possibly those lying in the semicircular canals and vestibule. 
The work which Carr and his students are doing upon the 
responses of animals to discrete impressions (delayed reac- 
tion)—e.g., exposing for one second a light in one of three 
places and then waiting a definite period, one, two, three, 
or five seconds, then releasing the animal to see whether it 
will go to the place where the light was flashed,—is showing 
us the extent to which kinesthetic and organic receptors 
may function in ordinary situations (p. 224). The homing 
sense in birds is another problem which may lie within this 
field. No one can say definitely to the contrary yet. Our 
experience already noted in getting the terns to come back 
home from long distances over territory wholly unknown 
should make us hesitate at least in explaining the homing 
sense in terms of the visual landmark theory. 
Entero-ceptive system.—The organic sense is especially 
hard to deal with in isolation. That it plays an important 
part in the daily activities of most animals is apparent. 
There is something in animals which functions like a time 
sense. Nest shifts among the terns and other birds show 
oftentimes a marked and regular rhythm. Hunger is prob- 
ably the most compelling of all stimuli. Since the stimulus 
to hunger consists largely in the rhythmical movements 
of the muscles in the stomach, it would seem possible, by 
operative experiments, to eliminate the afferent impulses 
aroused by these movements. It would be exceedingly in- 
structive to study the formation of habits, functioning of 
certain instinctive acts, ete., in animals which had under- 
gone such operations. 
Cutaneous system as a distance receptor.—Many prob- 
lems remain to be attacked in the cutaneous mechanisms, 
when they are considered as distance receptors. For some 
time we have felt the need of accurate information upon the 
sensitivity of animals to changes in temperature, i.e., the 
extent to which associations may be formed between cer-
-P-A-G-E-56
42 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
tain acts and certain temperature stimuli. The problem is 
surely not an insoluble one. Some preliminary experi- 
ments upon the sensitivity of squirrels to temperature 
changes have already been made. Further needed facts are 
those which relate to the animal’s ability to detect differ- 
ences in the moisture contents of two air columns, differ- 
ences in pressure between two air columns, and the extent 
to which olfactory stimuli may be detected by the cutaneous 
receptors in the nasal cavities (experiments must be carried 
out upon anosmic animals). Such experiments, in addition 
to the light they will throw upon the function of the cutane- 
ous receptors, will guide us and serve as a means of con- 
trol in determining the animal’s experimental range of 
sensitivity to olfactory stimuli. Furthermore, they will 
assist those of us who are engaged in the study of homing. 
As is well known, some of the homing theories maintain 
that the bird is guided back in its flight by responding to 
appropriate air currents, which may differ in their 
cutaneous and possibly in their olfactory values. Further- 
more, problems concerning the presence of a ‘‘ common 
chemical sense ’’ and those connected with the functioning 
of the lateral line organs lie in this field. 
II. Instinctive Functions 
Introduction.—In the chapter devoted to the special con- 
sideration of instincts, we shall discuss more intimately the 
nature of instinct, its origin, source, ete. In the present 
connection we are concerned with some of the broader 
questions which must be raised concerning the relation of 
congenital response to acquired forms of behavior, and 
to the study of the sense-organ processes. 
Some types of instinctive response.—In the first place, 
it is essential to know the stimuli which have native and 
unacquired biological significance: those to which, apart 
from training, the animal responds either positively or 
negatively or by the inhibition of overt response altogether. 
These types (and many others as well) may be more easily 
observed oftentimes in the lower forms of animal life, but
-P-A-G-E-57
  PROBLEMS IN INSTINCT 43 
they are not lacking in the higher forms, as has been al- 
ready pointed out. In addition to these there are those 
types of stimuli which produce first inhibition and then 
negative response, as the call of the mother hen to 
the chick when a shadow passes over the field of vision; 
flickering lights ; certain types of noises ; and sudden changes 
in the intensity and character of lights and sounds. The 
necessity of knowing the instinctive tendencies of our ani- 
mals comes out clearly in experimentation. Suppose, e.g., 
we desire to test the retention of an association between a 
very weak light and a brighter light, or that existing be- 
tween two colors: we find from our preliminary work that 
the animal is positive to the one or the other,—shows an 
instinctive tendency to go to the lighter or darker of two 
lights, or to the one or the other of two monochromatic 
lights. If the animal is allowed to obtain its food with the 
light to which it shows a strong instinctive tendency to re- 
act positively, we shall, after the lapse of the desired time, 
not be testing retention at all: we shall be showing simply 
that the native positive tendency still persists. 
The animal’s instinctive mode of attack on problems.— 
Furthermore, we have to be concerned with the animal’s 
method of dealing with objects and problems. The rat 
and the squirrel will claw, bite, hold small articles with 
the forepaws and nibble at them, sitting the while on their 
haunches. The chick, under similar circumstances, will 
peck at objects too large to seize and swallow whole, and 
will move them all around the room without attempting to 
secure them with the fect. Carnivorous birds will hold the 
booty with the feet while they rend and tear it with the beak. 
The monkey will pick up small objects and carry them to 
the mouth with one hand and bite off small portions much 
like the human being. The list of these native differences 
in reaction is almost endless. It is desirable to have 
accurate knowledge of them in order to shape our prob- 
lems for the study of these functions and of the ani- 
mal’s types of learning. The failure to take account of the 
instinctive capacities of animals has led certain naturalists 
and even scientific students of behavior to criticise many
-P-A-G-E-58
44 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
of the methods in use in the behavior laboratories on the 
ground of being unsuitable to a particular animal’s mode 
of life. In some cases the criticism may be just.2 On the 
whole, we think the behaviorist has not shown a lack of 
ingenuity in adapting his studies to the different forms of 
animals. 
Instinct and habit.—It is because of the intimate con- 
nection between instinct and habit that one most desires to 
get a clearer knowledge of the animal’s repertoire of per- 
fected instinctive responses, his partial and incomplete 
adjustments, and even his tendencies towards adjustment 
before beginning controlled work upon habit formation. In 
the common acts of animals how much is hereditary and 
how much is ontogenetically acquired? The squirrel has 
the ability, apparently, to pick out a sound from a faulty 
nut. Some animals seem to have an instinctive endowment 
with respect to the choice of food. The everyday functions 
of drinking, catching, seizing, and swallowing prey or booty 
probably belong in the class of partially instinctive and 
partially acquired reactions. The chick, e.g., while ap- 
parently it can drink instinctively, needs habit to perfect 
the complex act of striking, seizing, and swallowing small 
objects. Only careful experimentations upon young ani- 
mals will enable us to tease habit from instinct. The 
extent to which we have gone in this work will be taken 
up in Chapter IV. The problems in instinct have been 
little more than hinted at here. Enough has been said, it 
is hoped, to show the necessity for a wide knowledge of 
animals’ instinctive capacities. We have literally hundreds 
of books upon instinct. Most of them are worthless. If 
only the naturalists who made them had been taught the 
patient habit of stating just what they saw and not enlarg- 
ing upon it, what a mine such books would be to us! As it 
2 Criticisms have been several times directed against the carrving 
out of experiments in the dark room. These objections are pointless: 
first, because the behavior of the animal in darkness is just as im- 
portant a part of our work as his behavior in light; and second, even 
those animals which ordinarily use daylight, work perfectly well in 
the dark room and remain in good physical condition throughout the 
course of the investigation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  HABIT FORMATION 45 
is, we must begin all over again. Here, more than in any 
other place, we feel the need of careful field observations. 
III. Learnine 
Introduction.—On account of its bearing upon human 
training, learning in animals is probably the most impor- 
tant topic in the whole study of behavior. Entirely apart 
from this connection, this division contains the behaviorist’s 
most important group of problems, since by means of habit 
formation he finds the most direct way of controlling ani- 
mal activity. The fundamental instincts cannot be easily 
changed, but habits which are just as efficient and just as 
economical in the matter of energy expenditure can be im- 
planted alongside of them. ‘There seems to be almost no 
limit to the number of habits which the higher vertebrates 
may form, or to the complexity of such habits. The work 
of Pfungst on ‘‘ Clever Hans,’’ and of Krall upon the 
Arabian steeds are examples. We cite also the training of 
Peter, Consul, and Roger, as well as a host of other less 
well known animals. But these animals have been trained 
for purposes of exhibition. Their acts are almost com- 
pletely without scientific significance except in so far as 
they show the behaviorist the possibilities in delicate methods 
of training and the limits within which training may take 
place. Before beginning upon the simplest problem in 
learning, it is necessary, as we have already shown, to have 
some knowledge at least of the instinctive modes of response 
of the animal and of the receptors to which we are making 
appeal. In behavior up to the present time, we have largely 
put the cart before the horse. In entire ignorance of in- 
stinctive capacity and sense-organ functions, we have 
plunged in medias res and attempted to do satisfactory 
work upon learning. We have tried to point out under I 
and II that work of this character can never be final. Most 
of the work has been undertaken for the purpose of gaining 
orientation. We have felt the necessity of making broad 
and general studies. Nearly all of the longer monographs 
have treated of the senses, instinctive equipment, and the  
-P-A-G-E-60
46 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
capacity for learning of each animal studied. No one would 
attempt to study a new race of human beings in this whole- 
sale way. While it is highly essential to have pioneer 
studies it is equally important for us to remember that such 
studies are purely provisional and temporary. When we 
have finished our general survey, we are then prepared to 
begin really intensive work upon the animal. 
Grouping of problems.—Problems of learning and reten- 
tion may be grouped under three headings: (1) the ‘‘ per- 
severance ’’ or fundamental method of acquiring control 
of skeletal muscles; (2) efficiency of training methods; and 
(3) complex forms of learning. 
(1) The perseverance method.—The work on trial and 
error learning (better, ‘‘ perseverance learning ’’) has been 
rather desultory. It may now be safely taken for granted 
that’ every animal form from the Paramecium to the 
primate can learn by this method. Any further work in 
this field ought to have a definite purpose: either that of 
establishing norms in a particular form for the learning of 
certain kinds of problems for comparing with similar re- 
sults from other animals, or, that of obtaining laws of 
plasticity with respect to age, sex, species, ete. It seems 
quite essential, if we are not to waste time, to devise a set 
of standard problems which can be learned under stated 
conditions. There is no agreement at present about the 
most serviceable kind of problems, but there are movements 
towards such a standardization. In the chapter on methods 
several problem boxes will be suggested which seem to 
have a wide range of usefulness and adaptability. In 
the work of establishing norms for inter-species compari- 
sons, similarity in the types of problems is all that can be 
hoped for, so different are animals in their structure, size, 
and action systems. In the intra-species work all of the 
separate groups (the separate groups differing only in age 
or sex, ete.) of animals should learn the same problems 
under identical training methods. There has been great 
laxness in this respect. Many of the experimenters have 
not even felt the necessity of keeping the conditions started 
with rigidly the same throughout the course of the forma-
-P-A-G-E-61
  HABIT FORMATION 47 
tion of the habit. Intercomparability of records should be 
the chief desideratum. Given the learning curves of these 
simple problems, we should next, under conditions as nearly 
identical as possible, determine the retention of the habit 
after varying intervals. It is unfortunate that this has 
never been done with care. To do it well requires a large 
expenditure of time and effort. It is also highly valuable 
to obtain records for the learning and retention of complex 
habits. This has already been partially attempted in the 
case of a few animals,—the monkey and the raccoon. The 
problem chosen was a complex puzzle-box consisting of a 
combination of latches, bolts, and levers (p. 98). This type 
of problem is, in a way, highly artificial and foreign to the 
daily life of the animals. However, it offers an interesting 
means of establishing a set of ‘‘ unit habits ’’ which may be 
found later to be of great service in tests on imitation 
(p. 277). It is hardly more foreign to the life of the animal 
than are nonsense syllables to the human being. All admit 
the value to the latter of taking material that is far re- 
moved from his daily sets of habits. Similar arguments 
hold for the necessity of choosing like material for the 
animals, since here, as in the case of man, we wish to study 
what might be called the crude or native learning and re- 
tentiveness (corresponding. to the experimental range of 
functions as opposed to the practical range of everyday 
life). 
(2) Efficiency of training methods.—With standard 
records on the learning of simple problems before us, we are 
in a position to take up what we may call, broadly speak- 
ing, the distribution of effort in learning. What is the 
most advantageous way to teach a problem to an animal? 
Should we allow him to work at it continuously? Shall 
we give him one trial a day? Three trials a day? Five 
trials a day? Shall we allow our animal to form three 
habits abreast? Or is it more advantageous and more 
economical in every way to allow him to form his habits 
serially? What forms of incentives should be used, food or 
reward of some kind, punishment or a combination of re- 
ward and punishment? Furthermore, how shall we regu-
-P-A-G-E-62
48 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
late these incentives so as to obtain maximum but constant 
stimulating effect? We have been engaged in the study 
of these problems for some years now. That we are slowly 
gaining an insight into the efficiency of training methods 
may be seen from the summary of such work given on p. 
228. It is at this point that the study of behavior has its 
closest contact with experimental pedagogy. On account 
of the numerous conventions which everywhere surround 
the human being, it has been next to impossible to intro- 
duce experimental methods into the teaching of children. 
We are content, as we have been in the past, to teach in 
the high schools four or five subjects a day and to spend 
thirty or forty minutes, as the case may be, on each of these 
subjects. Who knows whether we are right in this pro- 
cedure? Surely here, if anywhere, animal behavior can be 
of practical service to the experimental student of educa- 
tion. In Chapter I it was urged that the results of experi- 
mental pedagogy should be put in such terms that they will 
be directly comparable with ‘those gathered from animal 
experimentation. It is hoped that the reasons for urging 
this are now clearer. 
(3) Complex forms of learning.—The third division, in 
learning is connected largely with the social life of the 
animal. To what extent is the animal influenced in his 
learning, (1) through imitation of a mate; (2) through 
imitation of the experimenter; (3) by being put through 
an act; and (4) by various forms of encouragement? 
Finally, do we find that animals learn by methods which 
are closely analogous to those employed by the human be- 
ing? A large amount of work has been done upon these 
various forms of complex learning. The problems are deli- 
cate. The results at hand are not harmonious. All of us 
have worked rather blindly. We have put our animals into 
strange and complex situations and have expected them 
to imitate acts of our own devising (which are oftentimes 
quite difficult), without being sure that the various simple 
coérdinations (‘‘ unit. habit ’’) are really parts of their 
sensory-motor equipment. Our procedure is on a par 
with asking a man who has never played the piano to
-P-A-G-E-63
  HABIT FORMATION 49 
render ‘‘ The Spring Song’’ on that instrument. It is 
useless to ask young children to imitate acts as wholes 
where the elementary codrdinations are lacking or are ill- 
formed. There must be complete mastery. of simple 
habits,—a readiness to respond to a difficult and complex 
environmental setting in a variety of different ways,—the 
ability to change responses ever so slightly to meet the 
slightest change in a heretofore well-known object. In 
order to do this our stock in trade of acts must be much 
more numerous than the objects to which we respond. Any 
one familiar with the early tentative imitations of chil- 
dren,—their failure to imitate at early ages the types of 
acts we call upon animals to imitate,—will not find fault 
with these statements. Apparently new codrdinations are 
not established by imitation either in man or in animal. 
What is new is the combination or method of, grouping. 
“Where imitation appears there are found always groups of 
flexible responses to every object worked with. Further- 
more, one is able to change the background or setting of 
the object (coincident stimuli) without breaking down 
the habit. It often happens that after an animal has 
learned to do a certain act, open a problem box, e.g., under 
given conditions, a change in those conditions,—removal 
of the box to another place in the room,—will produce a 
breakdown in the habit. There seems to. be a lack of readi- 
ness on the part of all animals to shift responses to meet 
slight changes in objects oft-reacted:to. Given enough co- 
ordinations of an elastic kind and it is hard to see how an 
animal can fail to imitate. Whether such conditions are 
realizable in the large majority of animals is the problem 
for experimentation to decide. The extent to which experi- 
mentation has thrown light upon such questions is discussed 
in Chapter VIII. 
IV. CorRELATIONS 
Introduction.—Studies upon the structure of sense 
organs and upon the nervous system generally seem to be 
somewhat out of fashion at present. We have never, in
-P-A-G-E-64
50 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
this country, paid the attention to the histology of the 
sense organs and to the comparative anatomy of the central 
nervous system which these subjects deserve. This condi- 
tion of affairs is probably purely temporary. It is cer- 
tainly devoutly to be hoped that the study of sense-organ 
structure, integrations in the nervous system, localization 
of function, ete., will, on some future swing of the pen- 
dulum, once more become central with the anatomists and 
neuro-physiologists. It seems discouraging that neuro- 
logical conceptions are so backward. We sadly need work- 
ing concepts of the nature of nervous impulses, of the 
anatomical and physiological nature of the sensory endings 
in the sense organs which are responsible for the different 
types of elementary functions and of the different chemical 
bodies set free by these highly organized structures: of 
fatigue products in the muscles, of the processes which 
make for the adaptation of sense organs and the like. 
In this day of advanced physiological and neurological 
technique surely the only difficulty in obtaining satis- 
factory answers to these questions is the lack of suffi- 
cient interest on the part of the men who are competent 
to carry out such researches. The interests of biological 
scientists are engaged chiefly in the study of evolution 
(variations, mutations, heredity, ete.), in the physiology 
of secretion, nutrition, and metabolism generally, and in ex- 
perimental embryology. The absorbing interest which these 
subjects afford leads to the neglect of topics which are not 
connected with the direct life-subserving functions of the 
body. 
Lack of behavior data handicaps the neurologist.—The 
lack of accurate knowledge of the range and delicacy of 
sense-organ functions, and of the integrations among sen- 
sory responses,—data which the behaviorist must supply,— 
makes the more careful neurologists draw back from the 
detailed work upon the structural elements which must be 
correlated with particular functions. A history of correla- 
tion studies shows quite clearly that the functional side has 
not been worked up with sufficient care to furnish anato- 
mists and physiologists with the proper bases for correla- 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  CORRELATION 51 
tion. There is little question but that a large number of 
correlations now adhered to between function and structure 
will have to be seriously modified or changed altogether. 
We call attention here to the work of Kalischer, Swift, and 
others upon the localization of the pitch center in dogs. 
The anatomical work was based upon the crudest kind of 
behavior work. At present the human psychologist at- 
tempts to correlate sensibility to wave-length differences 
with the functioning of the cones, and the finer sensibility to 
differences in white light with the functioning of the rods 
(and cones). The cortical projection centers for both sets 
of impulses are placed in the occipital region. The work 
of Franz, von Monakow, and others shows that we are not at 
all upon solid ground even with respect to the simple cor- 
relations which are used in psychology in everyday teaching. 
Simple working conceptions of what goes on in the nervous 
system when habits are formed will be very stimulating to 
the student of behavior. It would seem that the physical 
chemist and the physiological chemist might advance help- 
ful facts bearing upon these questions. The behaviorist 
is ready to assist in the work. He is in a position to force 
the formation of simple habits in whatever sets of sensory- 
motor ares the neurologist or physiologist may specify. 
He is willing to take animals at infancy and establish such 
habits in neural systems not previously largely exercised 
as, e.g., in association tracts in the cortex. Whether such 
work will ever throw light upon what happens at the 
surfaces of separation (synapses) through habit formation 
remains to be decided by future work. It is worth a thor- 
ough trial in some well-equipped neuro-physiological labora- 
tory. It is quite possible that the increasing accuracy with 
which sense-organ functions are being isolated will give 
a very decided stimulus to structural work in this country. 
Until the returns from this work begin to assume large 
proportions, one can hardly blame the more careful neuro- 
physiologists for interesting themselves along other lines. 
Donaldson for many years has been amassing a wealth of 
detail upon the growth processes and anatomical correla- 
tions in the rat. These studies have taken many different
-P-A-G-E-66
52 SOME PROBLEMS ENUMERATED 
forms,—from determining the total body weight and weight 
of the central nervous system (relation between central 
nervous system weight and body length or weight) of the 
animal at different ages, to that of the analysis of the chem- 
ical constituents of the nervous system at different ages. 
The work upon behavior has just reached the point where it 
may begin to take advantage of such material. C. J. Her- 
rick has suggested the advisability of centralizing behavior 
and anatomical work upon some one species of animal, e.g., 
upon the rabbit. While it is not advisable to limit behavior 
studies in any way, much good will come even from bear- 
ing such a suggestion in mind. The problems singled out 
should be definite and simple, and designed to emphasize 
the functions of particular organs or parts of organs. This 
would enable the anatomical work to proceed without wait- 
ing for complete returns. 
General aim of behavior.—It is believéd that the next 
few years will bring order out of chaos in the physico- 
chemical relations in the nervous system. That the organ- 
ism is a machine is taken for granted in our work. The only 
point we insist upon is that the machine be made not too 
simple to perform the multitudinous demands which the 
behaviorist must make upon it. There has been a strong 
tendency on the part of many biologists to assume that 
the mechanisms are exceedingly simple. ‘‘ Having found 
that the ovum of the sea-urchin can be fertilized without the 
stimulus of the spermatozoén, they fail even to give the egg 
the credit which rightfully belongs to it! ’’ It is hoped that 
the chemical and physical relations which exist in the egg it- 
self can soon be so thoroughly understood that the egg too 
ean be put together in the laboratory and then fertilized. 
The production of artificial protoplasm in the laboratory~ 
will in no way interfere with the study of behavior. Even 
after we have made it, it is highly probable that nature will 
still be allowed to take her course. As long as we have ani- 
mals in the world it is hard to see how the demand for a 
study of their methods of living, moving, and having their 
being can ever grow less. That such physico-chemical stud- 
ies can ever undermine our work upon habit formation, 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  THE AIM OF BEHAVIOR ; 53 
efficiency of training methods, the reactions of human be- 
ings to one another (ethical problems, ete.), the retention 
of habits, etc., is hardly likely. The tendency towards too 
great simplification is manifested in another way. Because 
it is found in a few cases (or in many) that animals respond 
positively or negatively to a physical stimulus without 
training it is assumed that the mechanics of response have 
been put upon a simple physico-chemical basis, that there 
is no longer any pressing need for a study of the reactions 
of animals, and that further work along such lines must be 
looked upon as routine. 
No one believes more thoroughly in the complete physico- 
chemical nature of all response, from the simplest to the 
most complex, than the author. We are prepared to state 
our belief in the view that we shall ultimately be able to 
trace the complete set of physico-chemical changes (quan- 
titative energy transformations) from the moment of in- 
cidence of the stimulus to the end of the movement in the 
muscle. In fact it is one of the goals of behavior to assist 
in making this possible. But again we insist that all of the 
facts about response be considered. In very few cases have 
we reduced reactions to their simplest terms. When we have 
done so we shall have no quarrel with the label which is at- 
tached to them, be it that of ‘‘ simple reflex ’’ or ‘‘ tropism.’’ 
Analysis of reaction must end somewhere. The simple 
reflex is a convenient hypothesis. It may not be a final goal 
any more than was the atom in chemistry or than the 
electron of the physicist may be twenty-five years from 
now. Both the electron and the simple reflex work well 
enough at present as convenient means of expressing the 
results of scientific analysis. The present end of analysis, 
then, in behavior will be the reduction of complex con- 
genital (instinct) and acquired (habit) forms of response , 
to simple reflexes. Having reached the goal it follows that 
complete predictability, both of stimulus and response, will 
be afforded. ; 
Furthermore, behavior is interested in synthesis as well 
as in analysis. The building up of habits from simple re- 
*Tt must be remembered that synthesis is essential to complete 
analysis of even tropism-like responses. Cole, Holmes, and others have

flexes for practical and theoretical (and ethical) purposes 
is as important as tearing them down. We should be able 
ultimately to formulate laws of habit formation (effect of 
punishment, of different training methods, retention, etg-).+ 
In the invertebrate realm wonderful progress has been made 
towards reducing complex responses to more elementary 
forms. Progress has been much slower in the case of the 
responses of the higher vertebrates. That some advance 
has been made appears clearly in our studies of instinet, 
and of sensory and motor habits. 
Summary.—In this chapter we have attempted to throw 
the problems of behavior into three great classes,—serise- 
organ functions, instinctive functions, and learning. “We 
have enumerated some of the separate problems in each 
division. It is interesting to consider now for a time what 
we would have before us if a large number of such prob- 
lems were solved: a group of isolated facts or a system ‘of 
behavior? As was pointed out in Chapter I, psychology; 
as it is at present adhered to, would say that the results 
would lack coherence and that the needed coherence could 
be obtained only by interpreting the facts in terms of con- 
sciousness. But introspection likewise gives us isolated 
facts (?). Titchener * points out that introspection is only 
a method. A method, even a legitimate one, can give us - 
only facts. Inferences, generalizations, theories, hypothe- 
ses, all are necessary to a science. But these are open to 
us. We shall obtain first a systematic grouping of results 
which will constitute the phylogeny of behavior; second, a 
similar grouping to constitute the ontogeny of behavior; 
and thirdly, correlations between structure and function 
which will be worth while. These three strata of facts 
will furnish the neurologist, trained in physical and physio- 
logical chemistry, with a set of phenomena which is tangible 
enough to guide research. Finally the raw material will 
shown that in the case of certain insects and frogs, the tropism-like 
responses to light (positive or negative reactions to size and intensity 
differences) fail to appear when definite objects are in the range of 
the visual receptors.

be at hand whereby behavior can be regulated and pre- 
dicted. The behaviorist will have his theories, his inferences, 
and his generalizations. A limited set of observations upon 
the visual responses of animals possessing a fovea compared 
with a similar set upon animals possessing only a modified 
retinal area may lead to the generalization that only ani- 
mals with a fovea are capable of responding to differences 
in the wave-length of light. We may then hazard an ex- 
planation of the phenomenon in terms of the lack of devel- 
opment of certain sensory structures, or of certain photo- 
chemical substances. In general, we have ahead of us prob- 
lems which, while not sharply separated from those of the 
experimental zodlogist, the physiologist, and the physicist 
either in subject-matter or in methods, are yet nevertheless 
distinct and independent. We have divided their labor and 
have marked off our problems, They are not likely to 
object to this or ever to claim any portion of the province 
which we are likély to want. Rather, they will gladly re- 
linquish all claim upon many of the problems which are 
ordinarily classed as belonging to their fields. There 
should follow a constant interchange, among these sciences, 
of behavior material, data on evolution, neural structure, 
and_physiological chemistry. \Phe behaviorist has no need 
to fear that this close contact with other biological and 
physical sciences will injure him. His field is too indepen- 
dent and too necessary to the other sciences for him to have 
misgivings about its future. If he becomes lost in a general 
biological mirage some other cause than his rejection of 
a psychology based upon introspection must be advanced 
to account for it.®

Introduction.—In this chapter only the more general 
methods and apparatus used in the study of behavior can 
be considered. The books of Jennings, of Mast, and of 
Loeb give adequate descriptions of the technical methods 
and the apparatus employed in the study of invertebrates. 
The presentation of the technique used in investigations 
of the behavior of vertebrates must necessarily be meager 
and incomplete. This field has been developed rapidly and 
the motives for development have been very varied. These 
differences in standpoint have had their effect upon the 
types of apparatus which have been devised and upon the 
methods employed in conducting experiments. In past 
years only the roughest kind of preliminary work has been 
attempted. In more recent times there has grown up a 
strong tendency to do more careful work with better instru- 
ments and by methods which are capable of being standard-

ized. This is shown by the general tendency on the part 
of investigators to standardize their stimuli and to adopt 
iron-clad rules concerning the physical control of the ani- 
mal and the objective recording of results. Up to the 
present time we have had to be content with a small begin- 
ning in the various laboratories. There has not been 
sufficient general interest in the subject to justify large 
expenditures for apparatus. It is hoped that the next few 
years will bring decided improvement in the equipment and 
housing of behavior laboratories. What is said here about 
apparatus and methods must be looked upon as suggestive. 
It is frankly confessed that probably too much considera- 
tion is given to those. used in the personal work of the 
writer. 
I. Tue Stmmuius To GENERAL ACTIVITY + 
Stimuli to locomotion.—The first and most obvious need 
in behavior is to provide some form of stimulation which 
will make the animal move in some way. Unless the animal 
will work steadily we are powerless to force habits upon 
him. We have as yet explored only a few of the various 
forms of stimuli which may be used for the purpose of 
calling out desirable general activity. As will be shown in 
Chapter VII, we have attempted to establish habits on the 
basis of providing ‘‘ satisfiers ’’ or ‘‘ dissatisfiers ’’ for the 
animal. This point of view is anthropomorphic and one 
which cannot be applied, or rather it is one which no one 
would apply in the realm of animals below the vertebrates. 
In many of the lower forms general activity of the kind 
we obtain by using food as a stimulus with vertebrates, 
ean be called out successfully by many different kinds of 
stimuli. Light, e.g., can be so adjusted in intensity that we 
1 We necessarily use the term stimulus rather loosely in_be- 
havior at present. We employ certain objects to make the animal 
move. Let us call such objects general stimuli. While moving in 
response to the general or primary stimuli (e.g., food or electric 
shock) we find that we can make him respond positively or nega- 
tively to light stimuli, sound stimuli, etc., that we can make him 
learn to open a problem box, ete. We shall call these latter objects 
specific or secondary stimuli,
-P-A-G-E-72
58 APPARATUS AND METHODS 
ean call out at will (1) general but undirected activity 
(shock movements), (2) an immediate positive response, 
or (3) an immediate negative response. We never think 
in such cases that the animal goes towards the light because 
it is a satisfier or away from it because it produces dis- 
satisfaction. For this reason we prefer to speak of stimuli 
positively and negatively reacted to in discussing the means 
by which we evoke general response in the animal of a kind 
necessary to the formation of habits. We shall consider 
-under two heads the more common forms of stimuli which 
we have found to work ina satisfactory way. (A) General 
stimuli to which the animal responds positively; e.g., food 
and objects connected with the sex life, ete. (B) Those to 
which the animal gives a negative response; e.g., the elec- 
trie shock, extremes of temperature, intense*light, ete. 
(A) General stimuli positively responded to.—Food has 
been the most commonly used form of stimulus for induc- 
ing general locomotion. The use of food requires a rather 
careful technique. If a large amount of food is given on 
one day the animal will be sluggish on the following day. 
If too little food is offered the animal becomes too eager. 
Long-continued experimentation with light feeding pro- 
duces a starved and unsatisfactory animal.. The most 
thorough way to go about the problem of food control is 
to surround the animal with the food which is necessary 
for its well being and then determine the length of feed- 
ing period required properly to maintain metabolism. The 
maintenance of metabolism can be determined by weighing 
the animal. It is not fair to talk of the cruelty and in- 
humanity of keeping the animal hungry, as has been done 
by several writers, until there is some factual support for 
the charge. There is not the slightest difficulty in keeping 
the animal in perfect condition and at the same time hun- 
gry enough to work properly. We have found no animal 
(as used under ordinary laboratory conditions) which does 
not work well when food is used as the general stimulus. 
Yerkes states that he was unable to use it satisfactorily 
with the dancing mouse. We repeated the maze experiment 
on the dancer with food as the stimulus. So far as we
-P-A-G-E-73
STIMULI TO ACTIVITY 59 
could judge the method was as satisfactory, from the 
standpoint of the rapidity of learning and from that of 
the well being of the animal, as the punishment method of 
Yerkes. Observers have stated that certain reptiles and 
amphibia are not commonly in a physiological state where 
food is positively reacted to; e.g., some of the reptiles eat 
as infrequently as once a month. Furthermore, in work- 
ing in the field it often happens that the animal under 
observation is not under our control to the extent where 
we can regulate its food supply. Under these conditions 
some other form of stimulation must be employed. Sex 
objects will certainly work well as a general stimulus in 
the case of some animals. This was shown by Dr. Kimball 
at the University of Chicago in his work upon rabbits. 
(This work was never published.) We have gone far 
enough in repeating his experiment to show that the female 
can be put in the problem box in the place of food. The 
male will attempt to get access to her by the same methods 
which he will employ in the case of the food. The male 
monkey will attempt not only to get at the female, but also, 
if at all aggressive, to reach other males in the same way. 
The difficulty with using sex objects as a general stimulus 
is due to the fact that sensitivity to such objects is as a 
rule seasonal. It is extremely difficult to use such a form 
of stimulation in the case of most animals where experi- 
mentation is to extend over a long period of time. The 
rabbit forms a notable exception to this rule. Even with 
that animal only the male can be experimented upon in 
this way. With some birds, not directly under the con- 
trol of the experimenter, and possibly with other animals 
as well, objects connected with the reproductive function 
are the only ones which can conveniently be used for mo- 
tivation during the breeding cycle. This is especially true 
with the terns. It was found that during the nesting period 
the nest and eggs could be used in place of food. The 
activity induced was fully as great, apparently, as that ob- 
tained in other animals by using food. 
(B) General stimuli negatively responded to.—A few 
years ago Yerkes advanced the view that ‘‘ punishment ”’
-P-A-G-E-74
60 - APPARATUS AND METHODS 
formed by far the best single method of motivation.. Pun- 
ishment was obtained by means of an induction shock ad- 
ministered by a metal grill connected with an inductorium. 
This punishment method has not worked any too well. It 
. has been criticised by Hamilton who found that it made 
his dogs restless and hesitant; by Lashley, who found that 
it made rats, where association was difficult, after a time 
refuse to work. Under ideal conditions, where the problem 
offered is easy, it apparently does hasten association. 
Hoge and Stocking found that discrimination between a 
16 cp. and a 2 ep. light was hastened by administering 
food as a reward, and punishment for failure. L.e., a com- 
bination of the food and punishment method, in their ex- 
periments, seemed to be most satisfactory.? In discrimina- 
tion work generally troublesome position habits are very 
soon set up. At first glance it would appear as though 
punishment were extremely useful in eliminating such 
habits. In actual practice it does not always have this 
meritorious effect—the animal becoming sulky under con- 
tinued punishment. Animals differ greatly in their sen- 
sitivity to the induced current. Rats are oftentimes 
badly disturbed by a current which is too weak for the 
human being to feel. Other animals are extremely resistant 
even to fairly high currents. The rabbit is not disturbed 
in the smallest degree by a current which is unbearable 
to the human being. Even when all possible objections 
are urged against the use of punishment it must be ad- 
mitted that in some problems (especially in the formation 
of sensory habits) where the animal is neither too resistant 
nor too sensitive, the use of the induction shock is to be 
recommended.’ In addition to the electrie shock, other 
forms of stimuli which are reacted against have been tried. 
In sensory habits (with monkeys) where two specific stimuli 
are employed we have tried the experiment of putting sharp 
needlepoints (not visible) upon the handle of the food box 
placed immediately underneath the color to be reacted

against. This method does not work as well as the electric 
shock. The reason is not hard to see. The avoiding reac- 
tion should be aroused at such a point that the animal when 
turning away from the grill can immediately turn towards 
the right stimulus. This makes the right response on each 
successive trial the one which was last executed (recency) 
and also the one most often executed (frequency). The 
role played by recency and frequency in the fixation of 
arcs in habits is discussed in Chapter VII. 
II.. Mernops or Stupyine THE RECEPTORS oF ANIMALS 
Forcing the formation of sensory habits.—The sensory 
range of animals and the sensitivity of their receptors can 
best be studied by forcing the formation of sensory habits. 
The method for establishing these has taken several dif- 
ferent forms. In forcing such habits it has been usual to 
confront the animal simultaneously with not more than 
two specific stimuli, although this method has by no means 
been universally employed. Multiple stimuli methods are 
sure to be found useful in certain types of work.* 
The general procedure is as follows: the animal is placed 
in an experiment box. This box has a home compartment 
* Multiple stimuli methods have not been worked out as yet in any 
great detail. Hamilton has made a series of tests upon mammals 
(p. 111). His method places the subject in an experimental situa- 
tion which may be reacted to in many different ways and with 
varying degrees of satisfactoriness or adequacy. The subject of the 
experiment is placed in a small room on one side of which there are 
four doors. From experience he learns that he may escape by one 
of the doors and one only, but which of the four to choose is his 
problem, for it is the plan of the experimenter to lock. in a given 
trial, the door through which the animal escaped in the previous 
trial and two others. Any one, then, of the three doors may be 
unlocked in a given trial. The animal has absolutely no way of 
predicting which is unlocked. Yerkes’s method is similar in purpose 
to that of Hamilton but it offers a somewhat wider range of useful- 
ness, It consists essentially in the presentation to the subject—bird 
or mammal; young or old; normal or abnormal—of a bank of twelve 
keys numbered from left to right, one to twelve. The subject is 
given to understand verbally, or through actual experience with the 
apparatus, that pressing some one of the twelve keys will yield 
certain desired results such, e.g., as the displaying of a picture, the 
presentation of food, the ringing of a bell. Success in the experiment 
means simply pressing the key which brings the desired result. The

where the animal is restrained until the experimenter is 
ready to make the test. At the will of the experimenter the 
door of the home box is opened and the animal is then con- 
fronted with both stimuli simultaneously; e.g., a circular 
and a square translucent plate illuminated from behind, 
each by lights of known candle-power. The circle and the 
square are separated from each other usually by a distance 
of 25 em. A partition divides one end of the stimulus 
chamber into two compartments. The animal, leaving the 
home box, may respond by entering the compartment illumi- 
nated by the square or the one illuminated by the circle. 
Usually several preliminary responses are taken to see if 
there is any instinctive tendency to respond positively 
either to the one or the other of the two stimuli. Where 
experiments upon retention are to be carried out later, there 
is general agreement that the animal must be trained against 
his positive tendency,—i.e., he must be trained to respond 
positively to the stimulus primitively reacted against. 
The fact that a general stimulus must be used in con- 
nection with the specific stimuli has already been stated. 
In using this method it is always necessary to have the 
apparatus so arranged that the positions of the two specific 
stimuli may be interchanged at will. This is necessitated 
experimenter sees to it that in no two successive trials is the same 
key the one to be operated. He is, further, able to push back out of 
sight any number of keys and thus to present the subject with as few 
as one or as many as twelve. Let us assume that in any given ex- 
periment the observer decides that the key the fourth from the left 
shall always be the correct one. It then becomes the task of the sub- 
ject of the experiment to suit his reactions to the number chosen by 
the experimenter. Only if he discovers the “ guiding idea” of the ex- 
perimenter can he succeed, trial after trial, in pushing the right key 
at first. It is obvious that both Yerkes’s and Hamilton’s methods 
serve to illustrate general reactive tendencies rather than to analyze 
reactions minutely and carefully. The methods are intended to bring 
into clear light those modes of responding to a given situation which 
are characteristic of different types or conditions of living beings, and 
thus to furnish a basis for a profitable comparison of reactive tend- 
encies.. (See Hamilton, G. V., “A Study of Trial and Error Re-

by the fact that the animals very easily form position habits, 
i.e., go repeatedly to the same side regardless of the stimulus 
to be found there. These so-called position habits are not 
always easy to detect. The animal often learns to respond 
to the rhythm of the shift in the position of the stimuli. 
The experimenter has always to be on his guard against the 
use of secondary criteria on the part of the animal. In 
control tests the series of shifts to be made on any given 
day should be determined by throwing a die. Since the 
highest number which can be thrown is six, the animal will 
not be forced to go to the one or the other side too often in 
succession. It is of the utmost importance for the experi- © 
menter to be out of the sensory range of the animal during 
all the control tests. An error which occurs by reason of 
the experimenter’s presence might almost be called the 
“Clever Hans error.’’ With slight modification of the 
above description of an experiment in vision the method 
may be adopted for use with olfactory, auditory, and 
cutaneous stimuli. 
Control box.—Much time has been spent in devising a 
box for controlling the animal which, without too much 
modification, can be used with all the animals likely to be 
used in laboratory work. The box shown in Fig. 1 is the 
most serviceable one we have at the present time for ex- 
periments upon the sensitivity of animals to light. 
The box we employ is 94.5 em. in length by 74 em. in width by 
25.5 in depth. It is divided into a home compartment, H, 31.5 em. 
in length by 25 em. in width, and a response chamber, C, 40.5 em. 
in width, which is partially separated into two smaller compart- 
ments by a partition. The length of the partition is 25.5 em. The 
distance from the door into the response chamber to the stimulus 
patch is 69 cm. The distance between the stimulus patches is 25 em. 
The dimensions of the face of the stimulus patch are 3 em. by 5 cm. 
The other divisions of the box are not important. It can readily be 
seen that it offers two alleys which lead into food compartments, F 
and F,. Two doors, D and D,, permit one to confine the animal in 
the chosen food compartment. By a special mechanism the doors 
can be closed from without the apparatus by pulling the knobs, K 
and K,. Two doors lead from F and F, into H. It is thus possible 
to work with the animal without touching it and without being seen 
by it during its reaction. By means of a special signaling devi 
the movements of the animal can be recorded without the necess 
of watching the animal. Two miniature lamps blackened, except

for an opening about 1 mm. in diameter, are connected with the 
platforms, S, 8, and §,. When the animal crosses S and goes into 
the response chamber both lamps are caused to wink (break circuit). 
If then he crosses the right hand platform, S,, the right lamp goes 
out until “choice” is completed and the animal goes into R. If 
the animal goes across §,, the left lamp goes out, ete. In the drawing

finding the door closed, it must retrace its steps and pass 8, and into 
R through D. The apparatus as a whole can be shifted so that the 
light can be made to fall either upon X or X, at will. The box is 
shown with punishment grill in each compartment.

  PAWLOW’S METHOD 65 : 
‘When made according to the above specifications the box 
is suitable to carry out experiments upon the following ani- 
mals: pigeons and other birds of like size, half-grown chicks, 
young monkeys (small species), guinea pigs, rabbits, rats, 
and squirrels. It enables one to control the factor of 
smell; to prevent the animal from returning to the home 
box; from getting access to the food if an error has been 
made; and to take a record of the time elapsing between 
the exit from the home box and a right or wrong choice. 
These are essential points in every method of physical con- 
trol. When the box is to be used in connection with the 
apparatus shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 6 the end bearing the 
stimulus patches is replaced by one in which two cireular 
openings, 15 em. in diameter and 25 em. between centers, 
have been cut (the height of the center of these openings 
above the floor is 10 em.). 
For the auditory and olfactory work slightly different 
types of control boxes are demanded. Fig. 12 and Fig. 14 
show respectively the forms which we have used. 
Pawlow’s method.—While properly belonging among 
physiological methods, Pawlow’s salivary secretion method 
has been widely used in animal behavior, by Russian 
students especially. This method is used to determine the 
efficiency of animals’ receptors.. The possibility of using 
it depends upon the fact that when certain animals 
(the dog has been largely used) are stimulated by 
chemical processes (the specific stimuli for secretion, food, 
ete.) a secretion of saliva occurs. The chemical property 
of food, which acts directly upon the receptors in the 
mouth, thus starting the flow of saliva, is the essential 
“ property.’’ This property produces an ‘‘ unconditioned 
reflex.’’ In addition to the essential property of food there 
are certain non-essential properties, such, e. g., as its color, 
brightness, smell, ete., which may, under certain conditions, 
produce conditioned reflexes. 
In actual practice the method is worked as follows: a 
healthy animal is chosen—one in which salivary secretion is 
abundant. The duct of one of the salivary glands is ex- 
posed on the outer surface of the cheek and a salivary

  Fic. 2. PAwLow’s EXPERIMENTS 
The upper left hand corner, X, shows the graduate attached 
directly to a small funnel fastened over the duct of the salivary 
gland. The lower part of the drawing shows Nicolai’s method. The 
dog is held in position by comfortable bands. The tube, T, runs 
directly from the funnel over the salivary gland to the recording 
apparatus, Y. Careful records are made at R. S shows the position 
of the stimulus (color, sounds, ete.) and F the food dish. At A, 
B, and C are shown three sets of records: A, the number of drops, 
the total amount of the secretion and the temporal relations when 
food is placed in the mouth; B, when the food is sensed by sight, 
smell, ete., C, when the color green is shown after the conditioned 
reflex has been established. (After Nicolai.)
-P-A-G-E-81
  PAWLOW’S METHOD 67 
fistula is formed. After this heals a small glass funnel 
or metal canula is attached to the opening of the gland. 
There are three methods of making determinations: (1) 
As the secretion flows from the tube into a graduate the 
drops are counted individually and the total flow of saliva 
read from the scale of the graduate; (2) the saliva is al- 
lowed to flow into a graduate tube attached directly to the 
funnel over the duct and the amount of secretion deter- 
mined by reading the scale of the tube. Under these condi- 
tions the tube must be replaced after each experiment and 
carefully cleansed. This method is shown at X in Fig. 2. 
(3) A metal canula is inserted in the duct of the gland 
and connected by rubber tubing with the small glass tube. 
The saliva drops from the tube directly upon the lever of a 
Marey tambour (Y in Fig. 2). As the drops fall upon this 
lever a record is made upon a smoked drum, R. From this 
record the experimenter may read the quantity of the 
secretion in drops or the total amount of secretion from 
the graduate, and also the temporal distribution of the 
drops. This latter method is the one used by Nicolai. 
The animal is next subjected to a course of training. If 
light response is sought, an ‘‘ association ’’ between the 
given light and food is established by exposing the eye of 
the animal to the light and then immediately feeding him. 
This light stimulus in time causes a flow of saliva. A con- 
ditioned reflex has thus been established. Suppose it is 
now desired to test the animal’s sensitivity to differences 
in wave-length. A green light, e.g., is exposed and food 
is given. This is repeated constantly until the reflex is 
established. Control tests are then introduced—white light 
or some other color is substituted for the green light. If 
the reflex occurs only (or mainly) when the green is ex- 
posed and inhibited when the other stimuli appear, we 
have presumably just ground for assuming sensitivity to 
wave-length differences. 
It is quite clear that Pawlow’s method, in theory at 
least, is designed to give the behavior student the same set 
of facts as the ‘‘ discrimination method ”’ (better sensory 
habit method) now so widely used. As a matter of fact it
-P-A-G-E-82
68 APPARATUS AND METHODS 
has nothing like the general range of usefulness of the 
method first described. In the first place there are only a 
few animals which can be successfully experimented upon in 
this way. While the dog lends himself very readily to such 
a type of experimentation, it is very difficult to see how the 
method could be worked upon the primates. The monkey, 
unless sevetely trussed, would not allow the canula to re- 
main in place very long. In the case of birds, fish, reptiles, 
and amphibia, the use of the method is out of the question. 
Furthermore, the flow of saliva in many of the small ani- 
mals is not sufficiently great for the method to be used suc- 
cessfully. In addition to these differences, which are de- 
pendent upon the anatomical and physiological nature of 
the animal, there are several inherent difficulties in the 
method. In the first place, these reflexes tend to disappear 
after the animal has been subjected to the same stimuli 
many times. In the second place, these reflexes have not 
the precision-like character which the students of Pawlow 
at first maintained. It is quite unusual for secretion to be 
inhibited entirely by the confusion stimuli. Positive re- 
sults obtained by this method are certainly of value. It is 
doubtful if behavior students, in testing for sensitivity to 
various stimuli, will be satisfied with obtaining negative 
results. 
Methods dependent upon instinctive response.—There 
is no doubt but that sensory habits arise much more rapidly 
where the food or other general stimulus is made to convey 
also the specific stimulus. As an example of the use of this 
method we cite the experiments in which Shepherd colored 
cubes of bread with different aniline dyes and soaked the 
cubes to be responded negatively to with quinine. Modifi- 
cations of this method appear in the work of Hess and of 
Katz and Révész. In the study of the chick, e.g., red-dyed 
rice grains are fastened to the floor, while the green-dyed 
grains scattered among these are left free. In determining 
the limits of sensitivity in the red and in the violet food 
grains are illuminated by spectral rays from above. The 
animal is supposed to peck at grains which reflect rays to 
which its retina is sensitive. In the case of those animals 
which either collect or disperse when light falls upon them,
-P-A-G-E-83
CRITICISM OF METHODS 69 
we may use a similar method. With fish which collect in 
the light it is possible to start with rays from the middle 
regicn of the spectrum and then gradually to lengthen or 
shorten the wave-length of the incident beam and thus de- 
termine the limits of sensitivity in the red and in the violet, 
as shown by the fact that the animals swim about ‘‘ aim- 
lessly ’’? as they do in darkness when the wave-length is 
such that it no longer offers stimulation (p. 841). In work 
of this character no food is employed. 
Control and auxiliary methods.—In all sensory habits 
it is necessary to show definitely to what stimulus the ani- 
mal is responding. In the case of two or multiple stimuli 
methods the animal may be responding only to one stimulus. 
If this directive stimulus is removed the habit breaks down. 
If one or all of the other stimuli are removed no break- 
down in the habit occurs. In order thoroughly to control 
sensory habits it becomes constantly necessary to be able 
to remove or add stimuli.. Besides the normal methods of 
controlling the stimulating factors in the environment, we 
have another very serviceable one; that of removing the 
sense organs not employed specifically in the task set the 
animal. Further discussion of control methods is given on 
p. 209. 
Criticisms on the methods for determining the sensi- 
tivity of receptors.—General criticisms of the exact meth- 
ods which have recently been employed have been urged on 
account of the slowness with which habits arise. It some- 
times requires as many as 500 to 600 trials to train an 
animal to respond positively to the brighter of two lights 
and negatively to the darker in the apparatus we recom- 
mend for such work on p. 78. On account of this diffi- 
culty. we have been criticised for setting the animal a task 
so far out of line with its everyday adjustments. The in- 
vestigators who criticise the more rigorous and exact 
methods on this score have had resort to direct food 
methods. As we have already stated, the habits arise very 
quickly under such conditions. Unfortunately the more 
rapid method does not yield results which can be inter- 
preted. In the case of dyed food we have no large control
-P-A-G-E-84
70 APPARATUS AND METHODS 
over the range of wave-lengths and intensities. If the food 
is directly illuminated we have no control over the relative 
absorptive powers of the food stuffs for the different wave- 
lengths. Many other objections to direct food method 
may be urged. While we admit that the exact methods 
tax the time and the patience of the experimenter greatly, 
yet their use is certainly to be recommended in all cases. 
It is to be hoped that some means of hastening the speed of 
the formation of sensory habits will shortly be found. At 
present the following devices are being tried out: 
(1) Attempts to increase the stimulating effect of the 
one or the other stimulus. E.g., we confront the animal 
with red and green and put a rotating sector in the path of 
the red. The sector is rotated so slowly that the red is 
made to flicker. If the animal, on his preliminary trials, is 
held by the flickering light and tends to seek it, we make 
red the positive or food color. If, on the other hand, 
another type of animal is frightened by the flickering red, 
we make green the positive or food color. Gradually the 
sector is made to rotate more and more rapidly until the 
flicker disappears. We are then ready to make our con- 
trol tests. 
(2) Attempts to increase the stimulating effect of one 
stimulus over the other by making the one differ from the 
other in several particulars. We may be working upon 
the animal’s ability to respond to differences in the in- 
tensity of two white lights. Finding that the discrimina- 
tion arises slowly, we make the two stimuli differ in size 
and in form as well as in the brightness and then gradually 
eliminate all differences except that of intensity. 
(3) We may use only one stimulus and get the animal 
to respond either positively or negatively to that. We then 
very gradually introduce the second stimulus. 
IiI. Apparatus FoR OBTAINING SPECIFIC STIMULI 
Apparatus for obtaining monochromatic light——The 
apparatus for obtaining monochromatic light is somewhat 
complicated and expensive. If there were any other way
-P-A-G-E-85
  
APPARATUS IN VISION me 
of testing, in a satisfactory way, the color responses of ani- 
mals, we certainly should not go to the spectrum for our 
stimuli. Investigators have tried various other methods 
but with such indifferent success that it seems now all but 
a waste of time to attempt to use any but spectral light. 
Without going into details it seems worth while to sketch 
the apparatus which we have found serviceable and then 
to take up the technique in presenting these stimuli. This 
will be done in the fewest possible words and without enter- 
ing into needless technicalities. In order to obtain spectral 
bands relatively pure and of the greatest possible intensity, 
a prism spectrometer should be used. The prism should 
be large in size. The intensity of the light, too, is depend- 
ent upon the size and speed of the lenses. We have usually 
chosen second-hand compound photographic lenses (por- 
trait lenses) of large aperture (4 inches) and relatively 
short focus (8-18 inches). We sketch below (Fig. 3) the 
simplest apparatus which will care for all the color work 
which is likely to be done in any of the behavior labora- 
tories.

72 APPARATUS AND METHODS 
(1) Sources: For testing differential sensitivity, limits of 
spectral sensitivity, ete., where high intensities are needed in control 
work, the automatic are light has proved the most serviceable source. 
In determining thresholds, difference limens, ete., the Nernst filament 
has been most frequently employed. It is possible now to have made 
a tubular tungsten source in a nitrogen-filled bulb which has a very 
much greater intrinsic brilliancy than the Nernst. When these can 
be more conveniently obtained, they should prove more satisfactory 
in every way than the Nernst. 
(2) Description oF SPECTROMETER: The condensing lens, Cd, 
Fig. 3, gives an image of the source upon the slit in the collimator, 
S,. The collimator is of such a size as to give a cylinder of 
parallel light which approximately fills the face of the prism, P. 
After refraction the light passes through the objective, O,, and is 
brought to a focus upon the (double) slit in the objective, S,. This 
slit will admit any two desired regions of the spectrum. 
(3)  Spacrne, REVERSING, AND Progectinac Devices: Imme- 
diately behind this slit are situated a’ series of spacing and reversing, 
total reflection prisms and three small projection lenses. In the 
drawing, red and green beams are designated. In order to permit 
reversing the two beams (no matter from what region they are 
admitted) must be brought within 8 mm. of each other. This is 
accomplished by introducing the two small reflection prisms, M, 
and My. The arrangement of these is clear from the drawing. The 
red beam, upon reflection from M,, passes through. its projection 
lens, 34, to the face of the large total reflection prism, TR,, thence 
downward to the plaster surface immediately below (not shown 
in the upper drawing but in the auxiliary drawing; the plaster sur- 
face is marked “stimulus patch”). The red beam does not change 
its position, consequently in order to reverse the right-left position 
of the two beams, the green must be made to appear now to the 
right of the red, now to the left. This is accomplished very simply 
as follows: Immediately behind the slit, S., one finds the small 
total reflection prism M,. The green beam is shown entering this. It 
is reflected and made to pass through its projection lens, 32, then to 
reflection prism 38 and to reflection prism TR», and downward to 
the plaster surface. Prism M; is mounted upon a small revolving 
table. When the table is rotated in the direction of the arrow 
nearest the slit, the green beam is reflected in the opposite direction, 
through lens 33 to prism 37 to prism TR;, downward to plaster 
surface. 
(4) REGULATION oF INTENSITY: One of the most important 
things in making tests upon the color responses of animals is the 
means of controlling the intensity of the light. Rotating sectors are 
extremely accurate and results from them are easy to duplicate in 
other laboratories. The principal difficulty with them is that the 
angular opening cannot be altered while the sector is rotating. At 
least this is true with all but the most expensive sectors, such as 
the Brodhun. Since two or three sectors are required, the cost of 
the latter is prohibitive. The Nichol prism is always exceedingly 
expensive in large sizes, and furthermore, when it is set to give the 
maximum transmission not more than 50% of the light is admitted. 
Another disadvantage arises from the fact that it is not possible to
-P-A-G-E-87
  
APPARATUS IN VISION 73 
use the prisms except with parallel light (at least the angle of 
divergence must be quite small). We have finally come to the method 
of using the smoked wedge. These are shown at W,, W., and W;. 
Each wedge is paired and mounted in such a way that the movement 
of a single screw will cause both wedges to move synchronously. 
The beam is not deviated by the introduction of the wedges (they 
are purchased connected to a strip of clear optical glass as shown 
in the diagram). The wedges are calibrated in pairs from the point 
of greatest transmission to the point of least transmission, by the 
Bureau of Standards, which furnishes a curve of wave-lengths on the one 
hand plotted against percentage transmission on the other. The wedge 
enables us to get over one difficulty which we have experienced in~ 
our color work, viz., that of getting higher intensities of light than 
that given by the standard intensity, as measured by the selenium 
cell (p. 75). 
(5) Inrropuction of Wuite Lieut: It often happens in 
monochromatic light work that one desires to introduce a certain 
amount of white light into monochromatic light or to substi- 
tute a white light for a monochromatic light. Both ends can be met 
by the very simple device sketched in the lower part of Fig. 3. A 
4-inch strip of fine French plate glass, PG (upper drawing), is 
introduced at any chosen point in the pathway of the three beams. 
This plate is inclined at an angle of 45° to the incident beams. The 
monochromatic lights pass on through the plate glass with relatively 
little reflection to the plaster of Paris surface. Immediately under- 
neath the plate glass one places a Nernst filament properly housed 
and supplied with a slit for controlling intensity. By means of a 
small lens an image of the Nernst can be projected vertically up- 
ward to the plate-glass surface, PG. The plate-glass surface reflects 
the beam (about 10%, which is ample), on to the plaster surface. 
On any of the plaster surfaces one can use at will (1) a pure mono- 
chromatic light, (2) a white light, (3) a light obtained by super- 
posing a monochromatic light of any desired intensity (stated in 
terms of energy) and a white light of any desired intensity (stated 
in photometric terms). 
Use of apparatus.—The description so far has been 
concerned with obtaining suitable stimuli which appear 
, upon the plaster surfaces. In any given test as we have 
stated only two surfaces are illuminated. As Fig. 3 is 
drawn the green light falls upon the extreme left surface 
and the red upon the central one. <A suitable control box 
(Fig. 1) is placed in front of the plaster surfaces. This 
control box can be shifted to right or left synchronously 
with the reversal of the right-left relation of the two lights 
described above. On p. 220ff. we have described some 
tests made with this apparatus. 
The selenium cell,—One difficulty in the way of using
-P-A-G-E-88
74 APPARATUS AND METHODS 
monochromatic light hitherto has been the lack of any con- 
venient means of obtaining uniformity of stimulation. Ap- 
parently the only wholly satisfactory method of affording 
reproducibility of conditions in the various laboratories is 
to state (1) the wave-length, (2) the energy carried by 
the monochromatic band,:and (3) the dimensions of the 
stimulus patch. With these constants given no difficulty 
need be experienced in repeating the work of another in- 
vestigator. On account of the small energy carried by such 
bands as are used in behavior work and the nature of the 
apparatus, great difficulty is experienced in adapting the 
ordinary methods of determining energy to our needs. 
The selenium cell, on account of its very great sensibility, 
seems at present to afford the best solution of our diffieul- 
ties, however complicated and cumbersome its use may be. 
In order to use the cell its ‘‘ sensibility ’’ curve must first 
be obtained. When a cell connected with a suitable source 
of current is exposed to light its resistance changes. It 
varies with length of the wave of the incident light.’ If now 
a galvanometer is inserted these variations in resistance 
show as deflections of the needle of the galvanometer. It 
is obvious that if we allow a given monochromatic band 
(e.g., red) whose energy is known to fall upon the cell, a 
given deflection of the galvanometer will appear. This is 
then noted. The wave-length of the bundle of light next al- 
lowed to fall upon the cell is shifted, but its energy is kept 
constant. This again produces a deflection which is noted. 
This routine is repeated from one end of the spectrum to 
the other. When completed we are enabled to plot the 
sensibility curve of the cell in terms of galvanometric de- 
flections on the one hand, and the wave-length of the 
incident beam on the other (the energy carried by each 
bundle of monochromatic rays being constant). The 
selenium cell has to be thus calibrated in some physical 
laboratory where a suitable radiation meter is at hand. It 
may be used though when no stable base is at hand. The - 
drawing and description given below (Fig. 4) give the facts 
necessary for installation and use of the system, 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  
a 
ot USE OF SELENIUM: CELL 
  Fig. 4. GRounp PLAN or SELENIUM CELL APPARATUS 
INSTALLATION AND Use oF Cetx: A selenium cell in the dark 
permits so large a current to pass that the resulting galvanometric 
deflection is liable to go off the scale. In order to remedy this defect 
the potential fall across the galvanometric terminals is compensated 
for by the introduction of a dry cell, DC, connected to the terminals 
of the 10,000-ohm. resistance box, R,. To one of the plugs a wire is 
soldered and by means of this connection is established with a 
similar resistance box, R,, which is finally connected with the 
galvanometer, as indicated by the drawing. This second resistance 
box, Re, is shunted around the first for two reasons: (1) the neces- 
sary small potential drop across the galvanometrie terminals may be 
attained; (2) a high resistance is shunted around the terminals of 
the galvanometer, hence, but little of the current from the circuit 
containing the selenium cell is diverted. In the drawing, all plugs 
in both R, and R, are removed with the exception of those indi- 
cated. While these particular resistances apply only to a particular 
selenium cell, it is readily possible to apply this method to any 
selenium cell, for by changing suitably the relative resistances in 
R, and R, it is always possible to bring about the desired condition, 
that the galvanometer shall show no deflection when the selenium 
cell is in darkness. In using the instrument, as installed above we 
first allow the current to run through the cell for approximately 
one hour. By the end of that time the slight heating effect so pro- 
duced has reached a constant. We next test the cell under the 
influence of a standard carbon lamp. In the original calibration we 
established the fact that the-cell gave a deflection of, say 60 mm., 
when exposed for 12.5 seconds to a standard 8-e. p. carbon lamp at 1 
meter’s distance. If, when we come to use the cell for equating 
energies, we find that the standard lamp gives a slightly different 
reading (due to temperature changes, etc.) we alter the sensibility 
of the galvanometer by shunting another 10,000 resistance box (not 
shown) around its terminals. When we are sure that our system 
as a whole is in the same condition as it was during the moment of 
calibration we are ready to equate our stimuli. Monochromatic 
light of known wave-length is allowed to fall upon the “ stimulus 
patch” S for a period of 12.5 seconds. By altering the intensity of 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
76 APPARATUS AND METHODS 
the light through the use of the smoked wedges (Fig. 3) we finally 
get the desired reading upon the galvanometer. We then repeat 
the procedure for the green light. In order easily to expose the cell 
for the desired length of time (12.5 seconds) the author has devised 
an automatic electric clock which starts the instant the light is 
turned on and breaks the circuit at the end of this period. By 
convenient switches the clock may be made to break the circuit 
through the standard lamp or to actuate a magnetic shutter which 
works over the face of the slit in the collimator, 8, (Fig. 3), (thus 
excluding the monochromatic light except for the 12.5 seconds 
interval). 
Device for securing a purified spectrum.—The spec- 
trometer system, as above described (p. 71), is arranged to 
test the sensitivity to differences in wave-length. An addi- 
tional device is needed when we come to test the limits of 
spectral sensitivity and to do threshold work generally. In 
such work great purity of the beams (freedom from white 
light) is demanded. It is well known that the spectrum 
obtained with any single spectrometer contains white light. 
The intensity of this light varies in different spectrometers 
and in the different regions of the spectrum of any given 
spectrometer. Ordinarily this does not matter, since where 
two beams are employed at high intensities, the intensity of 
the white light in each may be independently varied by the 
method shown in the auxiliary drawing in Fig. 3. In test- 
ing limits of sensitivity in the infra-red and ultra-violet it 
is obvious that the presence of white light in the beam 
would lead to results which could not be interpreted. 
White light may be excluded by the introduction of a 
second spectrometer. The apparatus then takes the form 
shown in Fig. 5.

in Fig. 3. After issuing from 8, the light (illustration shows that 
green is admitted) G, takes the following course: It passes first 
through the Brodhun sector, B sec. (which by a series of prisms 
rotates the light around a stationary sector, the angular opening of 
which can be adjusted so as to admit all gradations in the intensity 
of the light), then through a (1l-inch aperture, 8-inch focus) single 
achromat which serves as a collimator, thence through a direct 
vision refracting prism (l-inch face), through a (l-inch aperture, 
8-inch focus) single achromat which serves as an objective. As 
shown in the diagram, the white light in G is dispersed into a faint 
continuous spectrum along S,. The green appears as a very intense 
band. The slit opening at S,; is made just wide enough to admit this 
band. It passes to the total reflection prism, TR, and is reflected down 
upon the plaster surface below (shown also in Fig. 1). Examination 
with a pocket spectrometer of the beams so purified shows that the 
white light has been completely excluded.’ A spectrum so obtained 
is known as the “ purified spectrum of Helmholtz.” 
Apparatus for testing response to white light, form, 
and size.—Fig. 6 shows the apparatus required to test 
differential sensitivity to white light, to form, and to size. 
This apparatus consists of three chief parts: (1) a light 
box (Fig. 6), A; (2) an experiment box suited to the 
animal to be tested (Fig. 1), and between the two (3) a 
stimulus adapter, by means of which two illuminated 
areas are simultaneously exposed to view. This appears as 
the end (front) of the light box. 
The wooden light box, A, is divided into two compartments, C 
and D, by the partition, B. The sides, ends, and partition of the 
box are %-inch planed and seasoned lumber. ‘The inside dimensions 
are as follows: Length, 3 meters; width (between sides), 52 cm.; 
depth, 30 em. The bottom is 1%-inch planed stock, dowelled and 
glued. It is made 2 feet longer than the box, as a provision for the 
support of the experiment box. To the middle portion of the box 
are hinged two lids, E and F, of %-inch lumber. The edges of the 
box and lids are grooved and rabbeted. When the lids are closed, the 
two compartments, C and D, are light-tight with respect to one 
another. Two cast-iron carriages, G and H, carry incandescent 
lamps, which serve as sources of photic stimuli. Each carriage 
rides on a pair of steel tracks, IJ and KL, placed on the floor of its 
compartment. To the floor of each compartment is attached a 
Starrett steel tape, M and N, from which the position of the source 
of light may be read directly in millimeters. In order that daylight, 
instead of artificial light, may be used when it seems desirable, a 
hole 12.7 em. in diameter is cut in the end of each compartment. 
These holes are fitted with Aubert diaphragms, as shown at O and P. 
5Le., only a single bright band appears in the field.

  FURTHER APPARATUS IN VISION a 
The completed apparatus carries a system of ball-bearing pulleys, 
cords, and levers, not shown in Fig. 6, by means of which the ex- 
perimenter may shift the lamp carriages without approaching the 
light box or experiment box. Against the experiment box end of 
each compartment. of the light box is placed a water cell, R, to 
serve as an adiathermal screen. The cooling cells used by Bausch 
and Lomb in their projection lanterns prove satisfactory. They are 
circular metal cells of at least 11 em. diameter with a water space 
of 4.8x 12.5 em. The stimulus adapter is a device by means of 
which the experimenter is able to regulate the size, form, and position 
of the visual stimuli. A steel casting, % inch thick, carefully planed, 
and firmly bolted to the light box, is shown at z (Fig. 6). This 
sheet of steel contains two circular apertures, 10 em. in diameter, 
through which the light passes from the light box to the experiment 
box. To the metal plate, z, the stimulus adapter is attached by four 
bolts, one of which is labeled as h. The essential parts of the 
stimulus adapter are: (1) A metal frame composed of the straps 
d and d’ and the two vertical straps (not shown). The inner edges 
of the horizontal straps are rabbeted and into them is fitted (2) 
the aluminum plate y, which slides smoothly on a pair. of tracks 
(which do not appear in the figure), which are screwed to d and d’. 
y moves on six rollers. It contains three windows, each 12 cm. 
square, located 25 em. apart (center to center). These windows 
receive the standard stimulus plates. (3) Back of each window is 
attached by four small screws a square frame of 1-16-inch sheet brass, 
p, 9.3 cm. on its inner edges and 13.3 em. on its outer edges. A flange 
is thus created which serves to hold in each window (4) a brass 
plate, s, 12x12 em. and 1-16 inch thick. This plate contains an 
accurately cut opening. It is held firmly in position by two screws 
through diagonally opposite corners of the metal frame, p. At any 
time by loosening the screws, the experimenter may readily remove 
‘a plate and replace it by another with an opening of different size 
or form. The set of standard plates is fully deseribed in connec- 
tion with the table on p. 80. Between the frame, p, and the standard 
plate, s, is inserted a piece of opal-flash glass, 1. This serves as 
a diffusing surface and constitutes the stimulus area. It is held 
against the brass plate, s, by two screws. (5) To the metal frame, 
p, is screwed a ring of hard rubber, r, 4% em. thick, 2 em. wide, with 
a circular aperture 10 cm. in diameter. To this rubber ring is glued 
a ring of piano felt about 1% em. thick. These hard rubber and 
felt rings serve to fill in the space between the metal front, z, of the 
light box, and the aluminum plate, y, which carries the stimulus 
plates. (6) By means of the bolts at h, and corresponding positions 
in the three other corners, the stimulus adapter may be brought 
into the necessary proximity to z to prevent light from passing from 
one stimulus opening to the other, between z and y. Each of the 
four bolts (h) at the corners of the stimulus adapter carries, between 
z and y, a coiled spring which serves to press y away from z By 
putting the proper amount of pressure on the four springs the 
experimenter can so adjust the surfaces of the rings of piano felt 
to the planed front of the steel plate, z, that the light cannot pass 
between the two, while at the same time the surfaces may be moved 
over one another freely whenever it is necessary to move y. (7) At

either end of the frame of the stimulus adapter a stop, V, is attached 
so that y shall not run beyond the track, T. The most important 
part of the “brightness” apparatus is the set of accurately made 
brass stimulus plates which is briefly described below. The set, as 
used by us at present, consists of 26 plates. These plates fall into 
three groups: (1) Plates to test white light vision—three plates with 
a 6-em. circular opening and three with a 5-cm. circular opening. 
This provides a plate for each of the three windows of the stimulus 
adapter with a diameter of either 5 or 6 em. (2) Plates to test size 
vision—this group consists (including those of group 1) of plates 
with circular openings, which, between 6 cm. and 5.5 em., differ by 
1 mm. in diameter, and between 5.5 cm. and 3 em. by 5 mm. (3) 
Plates to test form vision—there are in this group four plates 
whose openings differ in form, while being equal in area. They are 
(a) the 6-cm. circle; (b) a hexagon 3.299 em. on the side; (¢) a 
square 5.317 em. on the side; (d) and an equilateral triangle 8.081 
em. on the side. The area of each opening is 28.2743 sq. em. In 
addition to the above there are provided three forms which are 
inscribed in the aperture of the 6-cm. circle. They are (a) a hexagon 
3.000 em. on the side; (b) a square 4.243 em. on the side; and (ce) 
an equilateral triangle 5.196 cm. on the side.

  APPARATUS IN AUDITION 81 
The apparatus as thus described is probably better 
adapted to test white light vision than to test form and 
size vision. Criticisms have been urged against it on ac- 
count of the fact that when a 5-em. circle is contrasted with, 
eg., a 6-cm. circle, there appears a difference not only 
with respect to size but also with respect to the amount of 
flux. H. M. Johnson is at present using a modification of 
the Ive’s grating which changes the size without altering 
the total flux. In regard to its adaptability for testing 
form, Hunter has likewise urged that ‘‘ pure form ’’ has 
not been offered to the animal: that what is offered is really 
a difference in pattern. We cannot here enter into the 
details of these criticisms (but see p. 366). 
Apparatus for producing auditory stimulation.—The 
auditory work in this country has been very backward 
largely because satisfactory apparatus have been very ex- 
pensive and hard to obtain. One of the serious handicaps 
has been the lack of a constant air supply for the Stern 
variators, pipes, and other wind instruments. It is highly 
desirable to make the finer tests on auditory sensitivity 
of animals with good tuning forks. At the same time it is 
essential to have control tones which can be substituted for 
the forks. The variators serve this purpose very well. The 
need for a constant air supply has been felt not only by 
the behaviorist but also by the human psychologist as well. 
The standard tuning forks are very serviceable and very 
accurate but they are almost useless in behavior work, un- 
less they are actuated by the method Helmholtz devised. 
We shall describe first the air supply system which has 
been in use in the Hopkins laboratory for some years, and 
then the Helmholtz system of tandem-driven forks. 
APPARATUS FOR OBTAINING ConsTANT AIR SUPPLY 
Figs. 7 to 10, inclusive, show the complete installation necessary 
for constant air supply. Figs. 7 and 8 show the interior construction 
of the Dureco O positive pressure blower, which is the essential part 
of the system.
-P-A-G-E-96
82 APPARATUS AND METHODS 
The drum of the blower is eccentrically mounted in the case of 
the machine and the vanes are so arranged as to slide in and out of 
this drum. These vanes are supported at the ends by shoes or rollers, 
depending upon the size of the machine, which run in a raceway near 
the outside circumference of the casing heads. The purpose of these 
shoes or rollers is to hold the vanes in position so that they cannot 
come in contact with the outside casing and thus cause a great 
amount of friction; they also hold the vanes in a steady position so 
that they can slide in and out of the drum without jerk or vibration. 
As the drum revolves the shoes or rollers in the raceway keep the 
vanes in approximate contact with the outside casing, but at all 
times there is a clearance. On account of the position of these 
vanes as the drum revolves the air in the casing is displaced and

the vanes force the air out of the discharge opening, at the same 
time sucking in the air at the intake opening. By reason of the 
special construction described above the machines are practically 
noiseless in their operation, have very little friction and require 
only a small amount of power.° 
Fig. 9 shows the method of installation. The pulley, P,, of the 
blower is belted to P2, the pulley on the shaft of an electric motor. 
The (14-inch) outlet pipe, OP, of heavy fireman’s hose runs into the 
bottom of a galvanized iron tank, 2 feet in diameter and 4 feet in 
height. The top of this tank is supplied with a spring pop valve, R, 
which regulates the pressure when no air is being used. The iron

supply pipe, Sp. P (1%-inch), leads directly down (or up) to the 
room in which the air is to be used. A cord, C, is attached to the 
valve, R, and runs over pulleys to the room where the air is to be 
used. This cord is attached to a screw control at H (Fig. 10). By

means of this control the air, when in use, can be held at any pres- 
sure. After the blower has run for a time the whole system warms 
up and the pressure rises somewhat. When the rise in temperature 
has reached a maximum the valve is adjusted to give the needed 
pressure. It will run indefinitely with a variation in pressure too 
small to be detected by a water manometer. Fig. 10 shows the 
method of using the air system with a Stern variator.

As in the previous figure, Sp. P and C represent, respectively, 
the supply pipe and the cord controlling the pop valve. The opening 
of the heavy gate valve, L, admits the air. The valve is opened up 
until the gauge, G, shows about 3 pounds pressure. (The higher 
the pressure within certain limits the less the variation in the 
manometer.) By means of the small cock, vv, the air which supplies 
the variator, V, can be accurately regulated. The pressure required 
to produce a clear tone in the variator shows in the water (or coal 
oil) manometer, M. The manometer shows extremely small changes 
in pressure. A pressure change which cannot be detected by a change 
in the pitch of the variator will show readily on the manometer. In 
attempting to test changes in pitch or intensity one must be con- 
stantly on one’s guard against changing the position of the head, 
standing waves, ete. Adaptive changes in the sense organ are also 
likely to produce apparent changes in pitch and in intensity. By 
making the proper double connections at vv it can readily be seen 
that the apparatus lends itself to the uses suggested on p, 90 as 
well as to carrying out tests with two variators upon auditory 
sensitivity in animals,

86 APPARATUS AND METHODS 
The Helmholtz system of tandem-driven forks.—Fig. 
11 shows Johnson’s modification of Helmholtz’s method of 
actuating tuning forks. The c-64 d. v. primary fork is 
mounted in a room 100 feet distant from the room in which 
the experiments upon the animals are being conducted. 
This fork runs continuously without attention from the 
experimenter during the whole course of the tests. Upon 
the table (Fig. 11) are placed the two stimulus forks 
S and S’. The system is connected as follows: 
The primary fork, PE, is actuated by a current passing 
from the positive pole of a 2-volt 6-ampere storage cell, ST, through 
the rheostat, R, to the binding post, a; thence through the fork, 
through the platinum contact, p’, with the mereury cup, ¢, through 
the magnet, M, to the binding post, b; thence to the negative pole 
of the storage cell. When the current is made at the platinum- 
mercury contact the prongs of the fork are attracted by M, thus 
withdrawing p from ¢ and breaking the circuit, which releases the 
prongs of the fork and permits the circuit to be made again at p 
and c. The primary fork is thus driven at its natural frequency. 
The secondary forks are driven by a current passing from the positive 
pole of a 4-volt 6-ampere storage cell, ST’, to the binding post, a; 
thence through the fork and platinum contact, p’, with the mercury 
cup, ¢, to the central pole of the double key, K; thence through an 
extreme pole of K through the rheostat, R, the magnet, M’, of S to 
the negative pole of the storage cell. For S’ the current passes 
through the corresponding connections from the other extreme pole 
of K to the negative pole of S’, ete. By means of the double throw 
switch, K, the experimenter can actuate either fork at will and for 
any given length of time. Since there are no electrical contacts on the 
two stimulus forks the tone produced is almost absolutely pure.” 
As will be seen from the drawing, each fork has placed over the 
ends of its tines a Kénig adjustable resonator which must be accur- 
stely tuned. By varying the height of the resonator a very great 
variation in the range of intensity is afforded. The only drawback 
to this system comes from the fact that a primary fork will actuate 
only forks the vibration frequencies of which stand in simple ratio 
to that of the primary. By choosing a primary of low frequency, 
64 d. v., a fairly large number of secondary forks in the middle 
region of the scale will be at our disposal (256, 320, 384, 448, 512, 
576 d. v., ete.) for testing differential sensitivity, response to clangs, 
ete. 
7If the forks are placed directly upon a solid surface one can hear 
faintly the undertone. If the fork is suspended and its resonator properly 
tuned the undertone cannot be heard beyond a distance of two or three 
feet. In cases where great. sensitivity in the deep tone is suspected the 
stimulus forks themselves may be placed some distance away,

Animal control box for work on audition.—A special 
form of control box is desirable for use in connection with 
the above method. It is shown in Fig. 12.

Y, and Y’ are doors, automatically swinging in the direction indi- 
cated. The experimenter’s place is in an adjacent room by window 
O in front of door V of the home-box. (After Johnson, Animal 
Behav. Monographs, Ser. No. 8, p. 32.) 
A is the home-box, 4 by 4 feet, in which the animal is placed be- 
tween tests. Entrance is made from. without by the door, V; B 
is an introductory alley, 6 feet long and 2 feet wide, leading to the 
alleys, D and D’. These alleys are each 10 feet long and open to 
alleys E and E’, which are shut off by the two doors, X and 
X’. These doors are made to open from the animal, and are closed 
automatically by a small coiled spring. Each is provided with an 
iron lift latch, which is heavy enough to catch when the door is 
closed. A string is fastened in a small hole drilled in the end of 
the lever of each of these latches, and run through an eye-screw in 
the door above, then through a pulley attached to the side of alley

E or E’, as the case may be, then to the operator’s place, so that by 
pulling the string the door may be unlatched and pulled open without 
the operator having to leave his place. When the string is released 
the door closes and latches itself. Alleys E and E’ open into two 
food compartments, F and F’. The covering of these boxes is pro- 
vided with two doors, located near the end of alleys E and FE’, 
through which food is dropped. Y and Y’ are two doors opening 
from food compartments, F and F’, into the home-box, A. These 
doors are not provided with latches, since they close behind the 
animal, flush with the jambs, and cannot be opened by an animal 
which has not free use of its hands. They are provided with coiled 
springs, like those on doors X and X’. The animals would usually 
open these doors from the food compartments, merely pushing their 
way into the home-box, but it is well to provide a means of opening 
them with strings, as are doors X and X’, for the sake of timid 
animals. Door W is opened by means of a spring. A heavy gut 
cord is fastened to an eye-screw near the top of door W, and run 
through a small hole near the top of the outside framework of 
home-box A, to the operator’s station, where it is hooked until 
door W is to be released. G and G’ are two punishments grills— 
strips of brass about 3 feet long, secured to a white pine board 3 
by 2 feet. Alternate strips are connected with the respective poles 
of the secondary coil of an inductorium, leaving the other end free. 
When the current is switched in, the animal’s foot must rest on two 
or more of these strips, which are only 1 em. wide and 1 em. apart, 
thus completing the circuit and causing the animal to receive a 
shock. The inductorium should be placed outside the room where 
the animal is being worked, and far enough away so that the 
sparking noise will not disturb the experiment. The current may 
be shifted through G or G’ by a double-throw switch at the operator’s 
station. The framework of this cage is constructed of yellow pine 
1 inch by 3 inches; the top and sides are covered with woven steel 
wire, having a mesh about 1 cm. square. Food is kept in both the 
food compartments, F and F’. The animal is given the problem of 
choosing a turn to the left into alley D, leading to food compartment 
F, at one tone, and a turn to the right into alley D’, to food box, 
F’, at the other tone. The stimulus tone may be sounded while the 
animal is in the home-box, A, and the animal released after it has 
been damped; or the tone may be sounded after the animal’s re- 
lease, say one-half second before he can reach the end of the intro- 
ductory alley. If punishment is to be administered the animal 
should receive it the moment he makes the wrong turn. 
  Yerkes’ apparatus for testing hearing in frogs (air and 
water).—Fig. 13 shows the simple apparatus for testing 
the auditory responses of frogs under the following condi- 
tions: When tympanic membranes are (1) in air, (2) 
half submerged, and (3) wholly submerged. As will be 
shown on p. 388, no direct response to sound is exhibited 
by frogs. In order to show that auditory stimuli are effec-

tive it is necessary to utilize an indirect method. When 
tactually stimulated the frog will jerk up its leg. Re- 
peated observations show the magnitude of this reaction. 
When a bell is sounded at definite intervals (i.e., within one 
second) before the tactual stimulus is given the height of 
the leg reaction may be (1) reinforced or (2) inhibited,

to its use as a device for testing olfaction it may be used 
for testing sensitivity to (2) differences in temperature, 
(3) differences in the moisture content of two air columns, 
and (4) differences in the pressure of two air columns,

  Fie. 14. OLractory APPARATUS 
The whole apparatus rests upon a glass plate and the inside 
walls of the stimulus compartment are lined with glass. The cover 
is also of plate glass for ease in observing the behavior of the 
animal. Two air columns shown by the two arrows on the extreme 
right of the lower drawing come directly from the air system, each 
being connected with a separate manometer. They pass over the sur- 
face of two fluids, in which appropriate olfactory substances have been 
dissolved, B', B*. After passing over the olfactory substances the 
8 As may readily be inferred, we may pass one air source over a dry 
chamber and another over water if our purpose is to test sensitivity to 
differences in moisture content. Or if it is to test differences in tem- 
perature, we may pass one through a small constant temperature air 
chamber. On the other hand, if we are testing differences in pressure, 
the two air sources are sent directly into the stimulus compartment,

air is piped separately into the stimulus box through the fine pointed 
nozzles, O, and O,. The nozzles are placed at an angle such that 
the two air columns escaping from them converge at a point, X— 
the apex of the two glass partitions, GP. It is at X that the animal 
is stimulated simultaneously by the two stimuli. Electric grills may 
be placed in front of O, and O,. At EF is shown a funnel, to 
which are attached two tubes. These tubes are connected with an 
aspirator attached to any convenient water faucet. This serves to 
partially prevent diffusion of olfactory particles. As sketched above, 
two serious defects are inherent in the apparatus. There is no con- 
venient way of admitting the animal and there are no exit com- 
partments. Food should not be used in the chamber but in the exit 
boxes. The entrance should probably be placed underneath the box 
in such a position that the animal would have to enter near X. 
Since opening this door would introduce variations in the direction 
of the currents O, and O,, the animal should be placed first in the 
ante-chamber, the door to which should immediately be closed. The 
air should then be turned on at once and the animal admitted. 
Immediately upon its correct response the proper exit door should 
be opened. Unfortunately no careful work has so far been published 
upon these forms of sense modalities, and investigators are working 
more or less blindly in trying to devise proper apparatus. Dr. 
Jean Weidensall carried out a series of experiments upon rats with 
this apparatus but the work was never completed. It was carried far 
enough to show that with the modifications suggested we may safely 
begin work upon olfactory and cutaneous sensitivity. There are 
many methods of conducting simple qualitative tests upon smell, 
taste, and cutaneous sensitivity. Such methods will be taken up in 
the chapter devoted to those senses. 
Yoakum’s temperature apparatus.—Fig. 15 shows the 
apparatus used by C. 8S. Yoakum for testing the tempera- 
ture sense of gray squirrels and white rats. 
The construction of the apparatus is as follows: Two galvan- 
ized iron boxes, A and B, are made with outside dimensions of 
9x9x24 inches. The inner opening or tunnel, running the entire 
length of the box, is 5x5 inches. The space between the outer and 
inner jackets is 2 inches deep. It entirely encloses the central 
cavity with the exception of the ends. This enclosed space is suppPied 
with three vents, an inlet, I, an outlet, O, for the water circulation, 
and an air vent, V, to relieve the pressure when water is admitted 
to the system. The outlet is placed at the bottom of the encircling 
jacket and brought to a level with the upper part of the box. Thus 
arranged it can be used to syphon out the water after the .day’s 
experiment is over. In the bottom of each tunnel small cubical food 
pans are sunk flush with the floor. They are placed near the end 
farthest from that used by the animal as an entrance. The back 
of each box is closed with a piece of ground glass. Separate electric 
lights EL, illuminate the tunnels. The temperature of these boxes 
is regulated by forcing hot or cold water of the desired temperature 
through them. A triple faucet is used; two vents to give hot and
-P-A-G-E-106

cold water, respectively; the third to give a mixture of hot and cold. 
The respective temperatures of the two boxes cannot be maintained 
with extreme accuracy. The variation is sometimes as great as 
2° © above or below the standard. ‘The two boxes can be inter- 
changed by means of a rope and pulley, P. The animal is admitted

Introduction.—Motor habits do not differ fundamentally 
from sensory habits, yet they are distinct from them in one
-P-A-G-E-107
PROBLEM BOXES 93 
respect. In sensory habits the investigator attempts in 
general to bring out particularly data bearing upon the 
stimuli to which the receptors of the animal are sensi- 
tive. In motor habits he attempts to bring out particu- 
larly data concerning the action system of the organism. 
In thus examining first one end of the reflex are and then 
the other there is introduced no change in standpoint or in 
method of interpretation. Further discussion of the re- 
semblances and the differences between sensory and motor 
habits may very well be left to Chapter VI, where the con- 
crete experiments upon them are presented. 
The problem box method.—The problem box method 
in animal behavior in one form or another is as old as 
civilization. It remained for Thorndike, in 1899, to per- 
fect the method and to make it serviceable for bringing out 
certain facts connected especially with what one roughly 
calls learning in animals. The forms of puzzle boxes in 
use in the various laboratories are very numerous. Their 
size has had to be varied with the size of the animal and 
their nature to suit the particular instinctive capacity of 
the animal. It is obviously impossible for the English spar- 
row to learn to manipulate all of the problem boxes that 
may be offered to the monkey. On account of the differ- 
ences in the action systems of animals no standardization 
of types has thus far been suggested. Each experimenter 
has devised problem boxes which he thinks will be suited 
to his animals’ capabilities. On account of this difference 
in the boxes themselves and in the technique of experimenta- 
tion there is no uniformity in results even in the same 
laboratory where different animals are used; and no hope at 
present of work being duplicated in other laboratories. 
Much better results could be obtained if groups of boxes 
could be devised which would be suitable for a large range 
of animals. E.g., it is possible to devise boxes of the same 
dimensions and which are manipulated in an identical way, 
that may be commonly used for mammals of small size— 
monkeys, cats, dogs, raccoons, squirrels, porcupines, ete. 
Another set could be used for birds; still another for fish, 
ete. The method of using problem boxes is somewhat as
-P-A-G-E-108
94 APPARATUS AND METHODS 
follows: some form of general stimulus is provided. This 
has usually been food particularly sought by the animal. 
It is placed inside the box. Some form of restraining cage 
is usually placed over the box (see Fig. 19). Usually one 
allows the animal to feed in the open box for a few days 
before attempting to give it the problem of opening the 
door. The general stimulus to work is thus strong by 
the time the animal begins its attack upon the specific 
problem. The mode of the animal’s attack upon the box 
while solving the problem depends upon its instinctive 
equipment and upon the type of problem selected. The 
animal is allowed to eat a small amount of food after 
opening the box and is then removed in preparation for 
another trial. The number of trials given per day alters 
both the form of the learning curve and its length. The 
subject of the distribution of effort in forming motor 
habits will be taken up on p. 228. The.recording of errors 
in the formation of habits of manipulation is almost im- 
possible. The time curve furnishes the best criterion of the 
learning of the simple boxes usually offered. 
Description of boxes.—Below we show some of the boxes 
which have been used with success in the animal work. All

that we maintain for them is that they are serviceable and 
have a wide range of usefulness. We do not maintain that 
they are better adapted to the study of motor habits than
-P-A-G-E-109
  
PROBLEM BOXES 95 
others which have been employed. Nor do we claim that 
placing the food inside the box is more advantageous than 
Thorndike’s method of placing the animal inside and allow- 
ing it to escape. 
Box I (Fig. 16)—the “ sawdust box ”—is one of the simplest forms. 
It has been widely used in work upon rodents. It may be looked 
upon as standing between the maze and more definite forms of 
problem boxes in regard to the type of activity demanded for its 
solution. The sides of the box are constructed usually of wire mesh. 
This extends to the floor of the containing cage on two sides and 
one end. On the remaining end, E, the wire netting extends only 
to the floor of box I. The animal enters under this floor and pushes 
its head into the interior of the box through the opening, F. It 
is usually banked upon all sides with sawdust to a height cor- 
responding to the level of its floor. 
Box II (Fig. 17)—the “latch box ’’—requires.on the part of the 
animal a narrowly circumscribed movement. It is made of the 
same material and in the same general way as box I. The fasten- 
ing, L, shows clearly in the drawing. Care must be taken to have 
  Fie. 17. Toe Larcn Box 
the hinges on the door work very easily, to have the socket which 
holds the latch very shallow; and the spring which opens the door 
work very gently. This box has been used largely on rodents and 
dogs.’ 
Box III (Fig. 18)—the “inclined plane” box—is shown in two 
forms. In its simplest form (Fig. 18), as used by the author and 
by Richardson, it does not work well. The animal may chew the
-P-A-G-E-110
96 APPARATUS AND METHODS 
string or it may throw the plane by pulling on the string without 
necessarily touching ‘the plane. Basset has greatly improved upon 
the original plan. Fig. 19 shows the form employed in his work 
  Fig. 18. Tue Inctinzep Prange Box 
and the details in construction and method of operation. The food 
box, A, is formed of wood, 11x12 inch base, 11 inches in height, 
and is covered on top and sides with % inch heavy wire mesh. It 
is fitted with a hard rubber door, d, 3-16 inch thick, 5 inches high, 
and 4%, inches wide. To the inner side of the door is fastened 
a cord which passes over a pulley, p, and is weighted at the other 
end with a piece of lead, 1, of sufficient weight to insure the opening 
of the door upon releasing the latch. B, shows the device for 
latching and releasing the door. A short distance above the door is 
fastened a 3-inch electrical magnet, m; directly below that is a steel 
wire, s.w, surmounted by a steel dise, s.d, of the same diameter as 
the core of the magnet. The steel wire holds the door by dropping 
through holes in two brass plates, g, which serve as guides, to a 
point, behind another brass plate, which is set at the top of and 
behind the door, 11% mm. below the top. The setscrew, s.s, placed 
on the steel wire above the lower guide prevents any further drop. 
When the steel wire holds the door the dise is 2 mm. below the 
magnet; when the disc is drawn up to the magnet 1% mm. clearance 
is allowed for the door to swing back. Back of the feeding box, A, 
is placed the inclined plane, I.P. The inclined plane has a hard 
rubber base % inch thick, 6 inches long, and 234 inches wide. 
Upon pivot standards rising from the middle of the base rests the 
plane itself. The plane is of wood fibre and of the same dimensions 
as the base. It is weighted at the end nearest the feeding box 
in order to insure its return to position after use. At the end 
opposite the weight and farthest from the feeding box, platinum 
electrical contacts, e.c, are placed in both base and plane. The 
power is provided through wires connecting the regular electric 
lighting system, 115 volts, direct current, with the wired apparatus. 
A 32 candle-power lamp is placed in the series in order to avoid any 
danger of short-circuiting. To make the contact and allow the 
current to pass through the magnet, thus raising the steel wire 
and releasing the door, it is necessary for the rat to step on the

PROBLEM BOXES j 97 
point of operation, 0, which lies well out towards the end of 
the plane. On account of a certain amount of latency in the 
operation of the magnet, the rat must not only make the contacts 
touch, but must also inhibit further action, remaining on the point 
of operation until click of the dise meeting the magnet is heard. 
Over the food box and plane is placed a cage, C, constructed of 
¥Y%-inch heavy wire mesh, the base measurements of which are 
24x 24 inches and the height 14 inches. This allows the rat ample 
  
  Fie. 19. Tae Moprrrep Inciinep PLANE Box 
(After Basset, Behavior Monograph, Ser. No. 9, p. 25) 
room to explore all sides of and above the food box. When the rat 
is placed within, the entrance, e, to the cage is closed. 
Box IV (Fig. 20) shows the box used by Porter in the work on 
birds. This likewise is made of wire netting. As used by him 
the, box was tilted forward so that the door would swing open 
when released. The bar, L, drops into a shallow socket. A string 
is attached to the end of the bar. This string runs upward through 
a ring at the upper edge of the box, thence along a wire arm, 
through a ring on the end of this arm, down to a loop, B, which is 
placed within reach of the animal. Another method of opening the 
box is shown. The string attached to the latch is fastened to a_ 
stud, C. The bird, in climbing over the side’ of the box, pushes in 
the string, raises the latch, and the door swings open. 
Box V (Fig. 21) shows a relatively simple combination of fasten-

ings. The animal, in order to open this box, must: bear down lever 
at left (1), push in bar at right (2), lift up latch in front (3), and pull out string behind (4).

Description of maze experiments.—The technique of the 
maze experiment is quite similar to that of the problem 
box. The animal is fed for a few days in the center of 
the maze without being allowed to explore any other part 
than the food compartment. After habituation to this 
environment, regular tests are begun: the animal is ad- 
mitted to the maze and allowed to find its way to the 
food. Both the errors (false turns, returning, and partial 
returning, etc.) and the time spent in going from the 
entrance to the food should be recorded. A record of errors 
made in the maze can be taken very accurately and con- 
veniently by two different methods. In the writer’s study 
of the terns the maze floor was lightly covered with a 
thin layer of coral sand. The tracks of the bird could. be 
seen plainly and the length of the excursions into the 
alleys, ete., could be measured. The tracks were obliterated 
by brushing the sand lightly with a whisk-broom. A better 
method for obtaining the same results is the camera lucida 
method, which will be described in connection with the 
circular maze.

THE CrrcuLAR Maze: The circular maze shown in Fig. 23 is 
made with wooden base and aluminum walls. The base is 150 em. 
in diameter and 4 em, in thickness, and is constructed as follows: 
Two wooden dises 150 em. in diameter and 2 em. in thickness are 
first sawed out. These two discs are finally glued together. Before 
gluing, however, the upper disc is marked off into a series of con:
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE CIRCULAR MAZE 101 
centric circles. The diameter of each of the circles is as follows, be- 
ginning with the outermost one: 140 cm., 120 cm., 100 cm., 80 em., 
60 cm., 40 em., and 20 cm. The cireles are then sawed out upon a band 
saw. The width of the saw is made just equal to or slightly wider 
than the aluminum sheets used for the walls. After sawing, the dise 
as a whole is converted naturally into a series of concentric rings. 
These are fastened down to the lower dise with hot glue and screws. 
The lower surface of the base is thus solid, while the upper surface 
shows a series of grooves into which the aluminum walls may be 
slid. Soft aluminum bought in rolls is used for the latter. The 
height of the aluminum is 18.5 em., the thickness, .8 mm. The 
aluminum is unrolled and cut into the proper lengths. Each strip is 
cut just 10 em. shorter than the length of the circular groove into 
which it is to be fitted. This gives an opening into the alley. By 
means of this arrangement it is possible to slide the aluminum around 
in its groove and thus to place the entrance in any desired position. 
Fig. 23 shows clearly the construction of the maze, the number of 
alleys, the placing of the entrances, and the radial stops. This maze 
offers several desirable things in work of this character: in the first 
place, it can be used on the unit plan, in that only the home-box 
and the surrounding segments need be used when a very simple maze 
is desired. The addition of other segments, then, merely increases 
the complexity in an, at present, unknown ratio. The coefficient of 
increasing complexity could be determined by allowing one group 
of animals to learn the maze in its simplest form, another in. its 
next most complex, ete. Secondly, the ease with which complications 
can be introduced makes the maze very desirable. This is brought 
about by the flexibility in the arrangement of the entrances and 
radial stops. The camera lucida attachment is easily installed: it is 
simple and permanent. A large plate-glass mirror, M,, 91 em. wide, 
121 em. in length, is placed at an angle of 45° directly over the 
center of the maze. This mirror is strapped by small clamps to the 
edge of the surrounding framework. At a certain distance from this 
mirror a second mirror, M, 60 em. x 75 em., is placed at an angle 
of 45° above the maze and at such a distance from M, that the light 
reflected downward from M falls outside of the maze. Below M, and 
in the path of the light reflected from it, is placed a single achromat, 
L, 6 cm. in diameter and 50 em. focus. The lens is placed in a 
barrel and the barrel is attached to a wooden disc 30 em. in diameter. 
This board ‘is attached to an iron collar which slides freely up and 
down the rod, CR. This gives a very easy means of adjusting the size 
of the image, focusing, ete. Below this first dise will be found a 
second dise similar in character and controlled in the same way. A 
pad of circular paper is laid upon this disc.* A reduced image, 
IM, of the maze appears upon this paper. Extraneous light is ex- 
cluded by means of a soft black flannel curtain attached to the dise 
which supports the lens, L. As may readily be seen from the figure, 
the maze must be illuminated quite highly in order to produce a 
clear image. The illumination is obtained by means of six lights 
  ® It is convenient to cut out several sheets upon a dise cutter and to 
stamp a hole 13 mm. in diameter in the center of each for the reception 
of are. 13 mm. in diameter and 1 cm, high placed in the center of the oar
-P-A-G-E-116
102 APPARATUS AND METHODS 
placed symmetrically around the maze and by one light in the 
center of the maze. The six lights on the periphery are supplied 
with opaque half-shades, the light in the center of the maze with a 
similar opaque circular shade. These shades are of aluminum, black- 
ened on the upper surface. The floor of the maze is covered with 
imported white linoleum. This serves to reflect the light upward to 
M,, thence to M. Passing through the lens the rays are brought to 
a focus at IM. The ratio between the maze and the image is 6.4 to 1. 
The image appearing at IM is extremely clear when proper precau- 
tions are used to sensitize the eye. Even the smallest mouse can    
  Fig. 24. CHARTOMETER 
be seen quite clearly. The movements of the animal are traced upon 
white paper with a soft pencil. In the early stages of learning 
several sheets of paper are used on each animal at any given trial 
in order to avoid a too complicated tracing. Each sheet is marked 
with the number of the animal, the number of the trial, and the 
serial number of the tracing. The length of the lines so traced is 
measured by means of a chartometer (Fig. 24). This instrument is 
surprisingly accurate even in measuring lines which are tortuous in 
their course. The error in measuring the length of the charted line 
is about 1 per cent.’?

been used extensively in the animal work—upon rats, birds, squirrels, 
monkeys, and man. It is generally considered to be a very compli- 
cated maze. Yet actual experience shows that the circular maze 
just described is probably equally difficult, at least for the rat. The 
dotted line shows the true pathway.

Complicated blind alleys, or culs de sac, are shown at A, B, D, E, F. 
It will be noted that C is not a blind alley but an alternate and 
longer way to the food. The animal is admitted at O. Food is 
placed at H. After the maze has been learned with the alleys lying 
in the directions indicated tne maze as a whole may be turned 90°— 
180°, etc., to test the effect upon the animal of changing the absolute 
direction of the turns. Fig. 26 shows a maze constructed for the 
special purpose of determining the function of the kinesthetic sense 
of the animals. 
As constructed for the rat the alleys are of wood 6 inches in width 
and 6 inches in height. The maze was constructed so that it could 
be sawed across the dotted lines a-b. It will be seen that by remov- 
ing or inserting the middle section, a-b, we can convert the maze 
respectively into its short or long form. The change merely increases 
the length of the four alleys without altering the relations of the 
turns leading to or from them. Particular attention is called to the 
fact that Q in the lengthened form comes to the point Q’ in the

Apparatus for the study of the “delayed reaction.”— 
The delayed reaction has recently been studied at the Uni- 
versity of Chicago by Hunter. On p. 224 we present the 
more important results which have been obtained. Fig. 27 
shows the needed apparatus. 
It consists of a chamber, G, of suitable size, made with glass sides. 
The animal is confined here while being stimulated by lights coming 
from the food compartments, L, L, L. The entrances to the three 
food boxes are equidistant from G. Any one of the food boxes may 
be illuminated at will by closing the switch at M. Grills for elec- 
trical stimulation are shown at a, b, c. The current from the second- 
ary of a Porter inductorium may be sent through any one of these 
at will by the switch system shown at N. The use of the apparatus 
in brief is as follows: The animal, previously habituated to the 
apparatus, is confined in G. A light, e.g., in box A, is turned on for 
» a definite interval and then turned out. After an interval (during 
which no visual stimulation is offered) the animal is released at G. 
His problem is to enter only the box in which the light last appeared 
m1 An animal, having learned the short form of maze in terms of kin- 
esthesis, should, when the maze is suddenly lengthened, attempt to turn 
into the blank wall at Q’; and run into the culs de sac, B. G, and H. 
Similarly, when the animal has learned the long form. it will, when the 
maze is shortened, butt squarely into the end of the alley, e.g., at 1,

Use of term.—Modern writers have given no fixed mean- 
ing to the term instinct. The word is in common usage in a 
number of different departments of study,—philosophy, 
psychology, and biology. These separate divisions use the 
word in widely different ways. Probably no other term, 
unless it be that of consciousness,.is more handicapped by 
its history. As one wades through the enormous literature 
and meets the widely different meanings attached to it, one 
is almost tempted to employ some other word. But in spite 
of its past the term is short, useful, and convenient. The 
student of behavior has come to look upon instinct as a 
combination of congenital responses unfolding serially 
under appropriate stimulation; the series as a whole may 
be ‘‘ adaptive ’’ in character (always adaptive from the 
Darwinian standpoint) or it may be wholly lacking in 
adaptiveness. Each element in the combination may be 
looked upon as a reflex. (An instinct is thus a series of con- 
eatenated reflexes.) The order. of the unfolding of the 
separate elements is a strictly heritable character. In- 
stincts are thus rightly said to be phylogenetic modes of 
106
-P-A-G-E-121
DEFINITION OF REFLEX 107 
response (as contrasted with habit, which is acquired dur- 
ing the lifetime of the individual). Such a series of re- 
flexes, or an instinct, is best illustrated by the young bird’s 
egress from the egg, and its later attempt at building a 
first nest ; the first fighting responses in young animals, and 
in general the first attempts of young animals to capture, 
kill, and eat their prey. The act must be observed upon its 
first appearance if it is to be seen pure, ie., without 
modification through habit. 
Broader definition of the term reflex demanded.—If 
reflexes and instincts, by our definition, are to cover all 
forms of acquired moyement not included under habit (p. 
184) it is necessary to add that the term reflex should in- 
elude not only the more definite and fixed types of reflexes 
with which we are already familiar through our studies 
in physiology, but also those which are less constant, and 
less predictable (i.e., less predictable in the present state 
of our knowledge of the physical and chemical processes 
taking place in the organism). Jennings, Mast, Yerkes, 
and other American writers have shown that even the re- 
sponses of protozoa and the lower metazoa are not reflexes 
in the customary sense in which that term is used, ie., in 
the sense of being absolutely fixed and wholly stereotyped 
forms of reaction. Every one will admit with Loeb that, 
given the same stimulus and the same organism, the re- 
action will be the same. Every one who attempts to work 
out a mechanical theory of life processes must admit this 
position, unless, along with his physico-chemical concepts, 
he is prepared to admit the possibility of the indeterminate 
action of entelechies and X-entities (see the work of 
Driesch and of Genung). But as a matter of observation 
we are not able in behavior, at present, to reduce all re- 
sponses to reflexes of this stereotyped kind. The organism 
is constantly changing. We may be able to control one 
element in the total system of stimulation of the animal 
at any given moment (e.g., the energy and wave-length 
of incident light) but we cannot control the internal 
physiological processes which are also essential parts of 
the total stimulation and which also affect markedly the 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  108 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
state of the effector. The two factors, extra-organic stimu- 
lation and intra-organic stimulation, together determine 
the nature of the observable response. If either state 
changes, the overt response changes also; e.g., the Stentor 
may react in several different ways or in the same way but 
with a greater or less amplitude to the same (extra-organic) 
stimulus, provided the physiological state of the animal be 
different at the different moments of stimulation. In a 
similar way it may be shown that the so-called simple 
segmental reflexes in the higher forms of animal life are 
not unalterably fixed in character. Yerkes has shown that 
the amount of reflex movement of the leg of a frog called 
forth by an electric shock can be greatly increased by 
introducing an auditory stimulus simultaneously with the 
electric, although the auditory stimulus calls forth no ob- 
servable movement when given alone (see p. 388). Similar 
conditions hold in the case of the human knee jerk, and 
other reflex-like phenomena. The physiologist as a rule 
has investigated certain definite types of reflexes which are 
usually adaptive in character, such as the pupillomotor, 
those connected with respiration, circulation, the action 
of the glands and the muscles, ete. In general, while he 
looks upon these simple, direct types of response as calling, 
on the structural side, for the presence merely of an open 
pathway from receptor to effector (or from sensory surface 
to muscular mass where a nervous system is lacking), he 
knows, as has well been brought out by Sherrington, that 
there are many influences at work which alter the pervious- 
ness of this pathway (blockage or the reverse at synapses, 
momentary or more lasting differences in the tonicity of 
the musculature, ete.), and thus alter the intensity and to 
some extent even the character of the so-called simple reflex. 
The simple reflex, then, even to the physiologist, as he ob- 
serves it in a spinal frog, is a general term to cover the 
more simple cases of segmental response. There is need, 
furthermore, to modify our notion of the reflex in still 
another direction. In reading genetic psychology, biology, 
and physiology, we are likely to be misled into thinking 
that all so-called reflex responses bear as definite and or-
-P-A-G-E-123
DEFINITION OF REFLEX 109 
derly a character as do those of which we have just spoken; 
and that their adaptive value can be as easily caught sight 
of. If we look at any young animal at birth we cannot 
fail to be struck by the inchoate mass of muscular re- 
sponse, such as the random movements of hands and other 
motile organs of the body, the wrinkling of the facial 
muscles, ete. None of these movements is stereotyped and 
none is adaptive in the sense that it ‘‘ puts the subject in 
the control of the stimulus,’’ to use a phrase often quoted 
by the psychologist. It is rather interesting that the Dar- 
winian, who must find adaptive value in all instinctive 
activity, has not scrutinized random movement more care- 
fully. If we examine the congenital movements of the 
young of any species from birth until the instinctive equip- 
ment is complete, we find (1) that, while there is no quan- 
titative study at hand, mere observation shows that the 
number of random and unadaptive acts is far greater 
than is the number of organized adaptive reflexes and 
instinctive acts; (2) that under the influence of natural 
environmental demands or training many of these separate 
random acts can be organized into acts which are usually, 
but not necessarily, serviceable to the animal (habit 
formation, p. 184) ; and (3), finally, that many of them lie 
unorganized throughout the life history of the individual. 
In regard to this latter point it needs to be said that 
habit formation ceases after a time; the exigencies of en- 
vironment (or the stimulating factors in the environment) 
are not sufficient, as a rule, to call forth all of the latent 
possibilities of organization. These random and spon- 
taneous reflexes, unscrutinized by the physiologist,—the 
ceaseless movements of hands and arms, the facial mus- 
cles, and the turning and twisting of the trunk muscles 
and head as a whole, and later, climbing movements, run- 
ning, jumping, etc..—are of vital importance to the be- 
haviorist, in view of the fact that every habit which is 
later put on by the animal must inevitably be analyzable 
into just such units. What is new in habit is the organiza- 
tion. The elements, in general, are as old, or as new as the 
race.
-P-A-G-E-124
110 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
Content of term reflex as used in behavior.—Reflex, 
then, as a unit of analysis of instinct (as also of habit, as 
a matter of fact, see p. 184), in the modified sense in which 
we use the term, embraces (1) the fairly definite and gen- 
erally predictable but unlearned responses of lower and 
higher organisms to stimuli. As examples of such acts 
among the invertebrates, we cite the responses of Euglena 
to the electric current, to gravity, to light, ete. These 
responses may consist of a definite movement towards or 
away from the stimulus. <A characteristic but less general 
type of response of this kind is shown when Paramecium 
collides with objects: cilia are reversed, the animal swims 
backward, turning on the long axis of its body towards the 
aboral side; it then reverses the cilia again and starts in 
a new direction and repeats the above movements until 
forward movement can be continued without hindrance. 
Among the acts of vertebrates similar in definiteness and 
predictability we cite the reflexes of physiology such as 
the pupillar, plantar, patellar, ete. But we must be careful 
even in these cases not to over-emphasize the concept of 
invariability and predictability, since depending upon the 
physiological state of the organism we find, in extreme 
eases, the situation where a stimulus which at one time 
produces positive response may, under other conditions, 
produce negative response, e.g., when the frog is in a 
temperature of 10° it is positive to light, below 10°, nega- 
tive. (2) We have in the case of both vertebrates and 
invertebrates many examples of highly unstable and in- 
definite responses. The picture here is in part kaleidoscopic, 
neither the elements nor the grouping possibly being the 
same twice. In this class would fall the unadaptive and 
abortive types which have been more or less neglected; 
movements of head, trunk, ete., and in the undirected (i.e., 
so far as simple physical stimuli under the control of 
the investigator are concerned) movements of lower organ- 
isms. The latter can be illustrated by the ceaseless swim- 
ming movements of Paramecia, the loping walk of 
Ameeba, ete. These responses as a rule have been called 
“* yandom ”’ both in the literature on vertebrates and in that
-P-A-G-E-125
  TYPES OF ACTIVITY 111 
on invertebrates. It is evident, though, that the random 
movements when viewed en masse are congenital responses 
typical of the series. 'The random movements of the chick 
are quite different from those of the tern, and those of the 
Ameeba are different from those of the Paramecium. Turn- 
ing now to instincts which are made up of these reflex units, 
we should expect to find them at least as lacking in fixity 
as the units which compose them; and yet, just as there 
are many reflexes which, when examined in isolation, are 
found to be fairly permanent and stable so far as their 
qualitative features are concerned, just so do we find cer- 
tain consolidations of reflexes which are stable and as much 
a permanent possession of the animal as its arms and legs. 
Possibly the argument can be most readily advanced by 
examining some of the typical instincts of the higher ver- 
tebrates. 
General types of instinct.'—It is impossible, with the 
survey of animal activity which has been made, to give 
anything like a complete inventory of the various classes 
1On reaction types see Hamilton, op. cit., p. 62. In his study of 
mammals—human beings, monkeys, dogs, cats, and horses of dif- 
ferent ages—he finds five reaction types, A, B, C, D, E. 
Type A.—This reaction must include a single definite effort to open 
each of three inferentially possible doors (for description of the 
method see p. 62), and must not include an effort to open the in- 
ferentially impossible door. It is called the rational inference type 
and is displayed only by adult normal human subjects. 
Type B.—This tendency involves trying all four doors but in 
an irregular order: the unmodified searching tendency. It is ex- 
hibited by only defective human individuals and by all of the animals 
in the following order with respect to frequency of its display: mon- 
keys, dogs, cats, horses. 
Type C.—Striking once each of the four doors in succession starting 
at either left or right: the tendency to adopt stereotyped modes of 
searching. This is especially exhibited by monkeys. 
Type D.—This involves the error of making more than one sepa- 
rate continuous effort to open a given door during the same trial 
but always with an interruption of such repetitions of activity by 
an interval of effort to open some of the other doors: searching tend- 
ency modified by recrudescent motor impulses. This tendeney regu- 
farly increases as we descend the phyletic scale. 
ype E.—This includes several modés of behavior which have a 
common objective characteristic, viz., automatism. It is a relative 
implastic unadaptive mode of behavior: the tendency toward per- 
severation of active impulses and inhibitions.

of instincts, or to give a classification which will be accepted 
by any large number of investigators. Nevertheless, we 
should expect to find, and indeed we do find, certain char- 
acteristic instincts in every species of vertebrates. If the 
animal has survived at all, it is necessary for it to have 
certain instincts which relate to food, shelter, reproduction, 
defense, and attack, ete. The table below may be found 
helpful in holding together the mass of material which 
one finds when examining the work of students of be-

As may be seen from this list, no attempt is made to 
produce a logical arrangement of instincts. This has been 
tried many times, but it is certainly impossible to get a 
classification at present based upon ay other grounds than 
that of general convenience. 
Methods of studying Ea Wo general lines of 
attack upon instinct are open to us. The first method is 
nN 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
114 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
that of field observation. The work of the Peckhams on 
the social and solitary wasps, and that of Wheeler upon 
ants, serve both to show the working of the method and its 
general usefulness. Unfortunately there is no work on the 
study of the higher vertebrates comparable in completeness 
with those we have on the invertebrates. Instead, however, 
we have a series of publications more or less restricted in 
scope which deal with separate species of vertebrates. 
There is a fairly large number of more or less chance 
observations on mammals in captivity in the works of 
Allen, Richardson, Slonaker, Small, Lashley, Watson, and 
Waugh; upon fish in the works of Bauer, Hess, Parker, 
Reighard, Romeis, Sheldon, Sumner, and others ; upon birds 
in those of Craig, Strong, Herrick, Hess, and Porter; and 
upon reptiles and amphibia in those of Hess, Newman, 
Schaeffer, and Yerkes. Completely worked out, this method 
would give us the life-history or field activity of animals. 
geeend. method is that of isolating the animal and ob- 
serving the ord@F of appearance of the instincts, measuring 
the degree of their perfectness, the progress towards per- 
fection through supplementation by habit, variations in 
their life-history, such as recurrency, waxing, waning, pos- 
sible loss through disuse, ete. 
Various results obtained by the method of field ob- 
servation—We can attempt to do no more here than 
illustrate a few of the more common instincts appearing in 
various representatives of the vertebrate phyla. In so far 
as possible we shall take one individual species and at- 
tempt to present a picture of its various modes of instinctive 
response. These responses are naturally given in their 
unanalyzed form, just as the animal exhibits them in its 
native habitat. i 
Instinctive activity of birds; the noddy tern.— 
(I) The general bodily form, action systems, and taxo- 
nomic relations of the noddy tern need not concern us 
here. (II) On the first day after hatching the young 
bird strikes feebly its parent’s beak. The movements are 
exceedingly poorly directed. Probably little food is ob- 
tained from the parent at first. Very rapidly the strength
-P-A-G-E-129
INSTINCTS OF THE NODDY TERN 115 
of the stroke becomes greater and at the same time ability 
to open the beak increases commensurately. More and more 
food is obtained. Finally, at the end of fifteen to twenty 
days the young can take the food from the parent as rapidly 
as the latter can regurgitate it. In eight to ten weeks 
the young bird leaves the nest, and after wing practice, 
strikes out in search of food. Minnows of several different 
species are eaten exclusively. As the adult flies over the 
water its eyes meet schools of minnows hopping over the 
surface. It darts downward, seizes them in the beak, and 
swallows them. As the crop becomes filled it will often 
fly upward and swallow with extra force, giving a peculiar 
twisting spiral-like movement to the throat. As soon as 
the crop is well filled the bird goes to brood the egg or to 
feed the young; or if a male and no egg has been laid, to 
feed the female. The search for food is again taken up 
at intervals ranging from two to five hours. The method 
of drinking is characteristic. As the bird flies over the 
water it darts down and skims the surface with open 
beak. Often it darts down and wets its breast feathers, 
especially on hot days when brooding the egg. Rarely, 
when soiled and possibly at other times, it dives completely 
under water. Occasionally it is found swimming in the 
water. (III) In its typical habitat the noddy needs no 
shelter or extensive protection from the weather. When 
young, the bird huddles under the wing of the parent, 
both to escape the cool wind and rain and the too fierce 
rays of the sun. Even while young it shows a peculiar 
response which persists throughout life: when the sun is 
particularly warm it spreads out one wing fan-wise and 
remains standing for long periods of time with head di- 
rected always towards the wind. This response begins very 
early, at about eight to nine days. Sunning is another 
characteristic mode of response. The adult birds collect on 
the beach or house-tops with head to wind, standing always 
a few inches apart. (IV) The bird is diurnal, sleeping 
apparently from dusk until dawn. Nothing is known of its 
sleeping attitudes. One bird occupies the nest at night 
while the other stands on a nearby limb. (The neighbor
-P-A-G-E-130
116 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
of this bird, the sooty tern, apparently sleeps in short 
snatches during the day and night. It is continually 
flying around the island at night, screaming and calling 
to mates and young. It has been nicknamed the ‘‘ wide- 
awake tern.’’) The noddy, both after its turn to brood the 
egg and after obtaining food, often goes to a house-top, the 
shore, a stake, or a piece of driftwood, and stands motion- 
less for long periods of time. (A common response of 
terns, boobies, pelicans, ete.) (V) Nothing is known of 
the process of mating, since they reach the breeding ground 
apparently already mated. The choice of the nest site 
is a very simple matter; almost any place which will hold 
together a few sticks, seaweed, or shells may be chosen. 
Both animals (mates) work vigorously during the period of 
nest construction. Sometimes a very elaborate nest is built ; 
at other times only a few sticks are thrown together on the 
ground or in the fork of some low bush. Often, as the 
animal brings in its single stick or shell, it will sit in the 
nest and turn round and round, thus giving the structure 
a characteristic shape. Quite frequently a half dozen shells 
and bits of seaweed are put in at the bottom of the com- 
pleted nest. The impulse to pick up straws persists for 
a long period of time, almost throughout the brooding 
period. During the period of active nest construction, both 
birds go out to feed. As soon as the nest is fairly well 
constructed the female sits on a nearby limb usually very 
close to the nest. She ‘‘ guards ’’ this nest practically the 
whole day long, leaving only momentarily to drink. The 
male, on the other hand, goes out and fishes. On his return 
he bows elaborately to the female and she in turn begins 
to strike at his beak. If he has food in his crop he re- 
gurgitates it and the female eats from his bill. Only one 
egg is laid. As soon as the egg is laid the instincts of the 
birds again change. Before the egg is laid the birds are 
timid and will fly up at the slightest disturbance. After the 
egg is laid the birds become exceedingly bold. They will 
fiercely attack the encroachments of any other bird and 
will even attack the human intruder. <A large number 
of the birds will actually sit on the nest and allow them- 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
INSTINCTS OF THE NODDY TERN 117 
selves to be removed bodily from it before offering to fly. 
The two birds take turns at brooding-the egg. The nest 
shifts occur sometimes with remarkable regularity, two 
hours being about the preferred time. A number of in- 
teresting movements in the matter of caring for the egg 
appear; it is constantly covered. They turn it round and 
round with the beak; they go to the water to wet the breast 
feathers to keep it moist; they shove one another aside 
when the shifts are made without exposing the egg for any 
length of time, ete. When the young bird appears, there is 
again a marked change in the type of response. The birds 
again take turns in feeding the young one (of this, how- 
ever, we are not sure). Probably the most interesting 
set of changes is that in their ‘‘ dispositions.’? As the 
young bird grows older the parents no longer attack the 
human intruder but leave the nest much more readily than 
during the brooding season. (VI) The noddy has an ex- 
ceedingly sharp bill and depends largely upon it in attack. 
When fighting on the ground it strikes vigorously with its 
wings. The blow of the beak of the tern is severe enough 
oftentimes to draw blood from the human hand. The beak 
is serrated on the inner edge, which enables it to hold quite 
firmly to an object. Two terns, in fighting, will strike 
vigorously with the beak and then lock beaks, and turn and 
twist, striking strong blows with the wings. It is no un- 
usual sight to see a noddy chasing a large man-o’-war bird 
from the island. He flies under the man-o’-war bird and 
strikes him on the breast until he soars up and leaves the 
island. These fights between the noddies and the man-o’- 
war birds are brought about by the latters’ attempts to roost 
over the nests of the noddies. Fights among the noddies 
oceur when a strange bird attempts to usurp the nest; to 
have intercourse with the female of the nest; to steal 
straws; or in general to encroach upon the neighborhood of 
a nest. They will also attack any strange birds that come 
to the island, with the exception of the hawks. (The young 
sooty, which is hatched upon the same island, exhibits an 
interesting case of death-shamming. When one, two, three, 
and four days of age it will not leave the nest upon the 
   
-P-A-G-E-132
118 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
open sand at the intrusion of a human being, but will 
lie in the nest perfectly motionless with head outstretched. 
Oftentimes when the little fellow is picked up and then 
put down again he will dart off rapidly to the shelter of a 
neighboring bush.) We have never noticed death-shamming 
in the adults nor a simulating of lameness (for the at- 
traction of the hunter, as is so often mentioned in the 
literature by the naturalists.) (VII) The noddy is migra- 
tory, wintering somewhere along the shores of Central 
America. Some time in April, they leave there in a body 
for Bird Key, Dry Tortugas, reaching that island often 
about the 27th or 28th of April. There is wide variation, 
though, as has been found lately, in the time at which they 
reach Bird Key. The time of arrival will vary as much 
as a month to six weeks. Some time in September, again the 
time is variable, but the 20th was once actually observed, 
they leave Bird Key and go again to their winter home. 
If the ability to home is instinctive, this bird exhibits a 
wonderful development of such an instinct. We have 
been enabled to get the noddy to return to its nest from 
all distances up to eight hundred miles over an open water 
pathway (Galveston to Bird Key). (VIII) While young 
the noddy gives a gentle peep exceedingly like that of the 
chick. The variety and range of its vocal accomplish- 
ments are exceedingly limited. The adult bird is almost 
silent, day and night. Occasionally as one approaches its 
nest it will give a hoarse hiss-like warning ery, and then 
again a purring, unbird-like kind of noise, during periods 
of feeding and sex activity. (IX) This bird shows some 
interesting unadaptive types of response. The most inter- 
esting one is its inveterate system of nodding to every 
bird that comes near it and to its mate. This nodding is 
often preliminary to a fight; to a shift at the nest between 
the mates; and to sex activity. The photograph, -Fig. 28, 
shown below, gives some idea of the elaborateness of the 
process. Another form falling under this head is that of 
complete cessation of activity for long periods of time. 
This has already been mentioned under another head. It 
is possible that there are a large number of such acts ex-
-P-A-G-E-133
  INSTINCTS OF THE NODDY TERN 119 
hibited during the mating period, but since we have not 
been able to observe this, no record can be given. (In 
a number of other birds elaborate dances are gone through 
with as well as certain peculiar antics which are described 
  
  Fic. 28. Noppies 1n rue Act or Bowing 
by Fisher.t. Another example of such peculiar responses 
may be found in the inflation of the cheek pouches exhibited 
by the man-o’-war bird.) (X) There are so many random 
acts exhibited by the young birds of this species that an 
enumeration or classification of them is impossible in this 
connection. (XI) Very great individual differences were 
noted in the persistency of certain of the birds in working 
at a problem, e.g., where entrance to the nest was denied. 
There are also very great differences in the boldness of the 
birds. At certain nests the birds will always fly up at the 
observer’s approach during the entire nesting period; at 
others, the birds will remain in the nest even after very 
rough handling—often after they have been picked up 
and sent off on trips they will suffer themselves again to be

caught and sent off. Many tricks, such as pecking at the 
toes, idly pecking at the nest material, tricks which might 
serve to identify the birds, were observed. 
Instinctive activity of reptiles——Very little is known 
concerning the phylogenetic modes of response of the rep- 
tiles. We shall mention some of the more common types of 
response found in the tortoise. (I) Aspidonectes (the 
‘* soft-shell ’’ tortoise) runs swiftly on the land and when 
in the water swims with powerful strokes. It is almost im- 
possible to overtake it by running. The essential form 
of the tortoise, ete., are too well known to require a separate 
description. (IL) Aspidonectes is carnivorous, feeding upon 
crayfish and the larve of large insects. It crawls or swims 
along, thrusting its snout into masses of aquatic vegeta- 
tion, picking up now and then a crayfish, etc., swallowing 
the booty whole and, when needed, using the forefeet to 
force the food down. It is rather interesting that fish 
often accompany this species of turtle in its wanderings 
after food. The turtle often stirs up and dislodges food 
which it cannot capture but which the fish can take with 
ease. (IIL) This animal, at the onset of cold weather, 
buries itself in the mud, and hibernates until the warm 
spring days of April come. It buries itself in the mud in 
a peculiar way, by rocking the body from side to side and 
throwing the mud up in such a way that it settles on the 
carapace and covers it quickly from sight. It sinks deeper 
and deeper until it gets well below the frost line. It comes 
out in April in a very much weakened condition. (IV) 
This animal has a tendency to lie on floating objects. On 
approach, it invariably slides off into the water. When on a 
floating object, it always lies facing the water; conse- 
quently no time is lost in turning when danger approaches. 
At times it crawls out on a bank and basks in the sun. 
Lying in shallow water, which is of course always warmer, 
is another favorite mode of response. By this process the 
turtle obtains both rest and warmth. From Newman’s de- 
scription of its activity, it would seem that this variety is 
diurnal. In the case of the loggerhead turtle, during the 
period when the eggs are laid, the animal is usually noc-
-P-A-G-E-135
INSTINCTS OF REPTILES 121 
turnal in its land habits. The general mode for catching 
the green and the loggerhead turtle is to walk around the 
shore lines of the small islands on moonlight nights. The 
turtles crawl out at night to lay their eggs and if seen 
quickly enough can be turned over on their backs in such 
a way that they are helpless. When large numbers are 
captured they are taken to the various marketplaces and 
sold. (V) Little is known of the process of mating, sexual 
activity, etc., in the case of the turtle. Aspidonectes begins 
to lay early in June. These animals are exceedingly wary 
in their choice of times and places for laying. This species 
apparently lays its eggs during the daytime. The animal 
comes to the surface many yards from the shore and care- 
fully reconnoiters before coming ashore. On reaching it 
the turtle comes out on the sand, extending the head at 
its full height and remaining motionless for some time. 
If at this time a slight movement or faint sound alarms the 
animal it dashes back into the water. When undis- 
turbed, it proceeds slowly and cautiously to the nesting 
ground. The female scratches out foot-holds for the fore- 
feet and excavates with the hind-feet, using the right and 
left foot alternately with a circular gouging movement. At 
intervals she pushes aside the accumulated earth with her 
hind-feet. In less than 40 minutes (single observation) 
the nest is completed and she commences to lay the eggs. 
After laying several eggs, she arranges them with the hind- 
feet and rakes in earth previously wet with water from the 
aecessory bladders. The earth is generally packed in be- _ 
fore any more eggs are laid. The remainder of the eggs 
are laid and the earth is tramped upon quite firmly with 
the knuckles of the hind-feet, the right and left foot being 
again used alternately. The treading movements continue 
for some minutes. No attempt is made to cover up the 
traces of the feet. It has been said on good authority that 
the tortoise cannot be frightened away when making her 
nest. This apparently is not true with the various species 
studied by Newman. However, if laying has actually be- 
gun, the animal will hesitate. long enough to cover up the 
eggs more or less completely when surprised. Yet again,
-P-A-G-E-136
122 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
nests may be found with eggs completely exposed. The 
number of eggs laid ranges from nine to twenty-four. 
Instinctive activity of fish—There has been very little 
work done in the way of systematic and continuous 
observation of fishes. The most striking work which has 
yet appeared upon the instincts of fish was reported by 
Jacob Reighard upon the breeding behavior (V) of the 
dogfish (Amia calva Linneus). During the last week in 
April the male of this species fixes on the nesting location. 
This is usually a place in a quiet bay or inlet well grown 
with water plants. He constructs a saucer-like excavation 
30 to 90 cm. in diameter and from 10 to 20 em. deep. The 
bottom of the excavation is covered with the fibrous roots 
of water plants, which form a spongy mass. At times the 
bottom is of gravel, sand, or black loam. Occasionally one 
finds in it water-soaked stems or leaves of cattails or other 
similar water plants. The sides of the nest are usually of 
rootlets and growing plants. The fish usually selects a 
relatively plantless area surrounded by a wall of growing 
plants and from this area removes the few young shoots. 
The nest is constructed entirely by the male without assist- 
ance from the female. The method of constructing the 
nest is to fan away the vegetation and ooze so as to expose 
the underlying material, and to rub down and bite away the 
scant vegetation. The nests are built usually at night, 
each nest being the property of an individual male. After 
the nest is constructed the male guards it for a period 
of usually 24 to 36 hours, but such a period may be 
extended to six days or possibly longer. At times the 
male will leave the nest. If females do not appear, he 
finally abandons the nest. The sexes seem to be able to 
detect one another at considerable distances (smell?), and 
the females apparently seek the nests prepared by the males. 
After the female reaches the nest, spawning may: be ob- 
served. The male is very active at the time of spawning. 
He circles around the female in such a way as to meet her 
head on and travels towards her tail. In passing over her 
body he bites her on the snout and sides of her head and 
body as far back as the middle. At times during this
-P-A-G-E-137
  INSTINCTS OF FISH 123 
period both animals leave the nest. On each return the 
male reéngages in the circling movement. The female 
usually lies quietly upon the nest. After 15 to 20 
minutes of these circling movements the female is suffi- 
ciently stimulated to deposit the eggs. The male then 
approaches the female and lies by her side. This marks 
the completion of spawning. Spawning is done inter- 
mittently and usually at night. Apparently more than one 
female may spawn in the nest with an individual male. 
Then begins the guarding of the eggs, also by the male. 
The male lies at times directly over the nest, while at other 
times he is concealed in the natural openings of the ad- 
jacent vegetation. At these times one can approach 
within a very short distance of the nest. Usually as 
the observer approaches the male moves towards him, 
but not usually beyond the limits of the nest. If fright- 
ened, he dashes away. After a time he returns slowly and 
quietly to the nest. When the male guards the nest he lies, 
for the most part, quietly, or with only slight movements 
of his fins, but at intervals he moves over the nest, and thus 
by the movement of his fins keeps the eggs free from sedi- 
ment which would otherwise soon smother them. He also 
keeps away other animals that try to occupy the nest. 
Fierce fights between the males are described by Whitman 
and Ecleshymer. The male also has to keep off the minnows 
and sunfish. The eggs hatch in from eight to ten days. 
When the larve are about 12 to 13 mm. in length they leave 
the nest. Observations have been made upon behavior dur- 
ing nest forsaking. The movements of the swarm of larve 
when leaving the nest suggest that it follows the trail of 
the male by scent.? 
Special forms of instinctive response in fish—Mention 
2 To test this matter a rough model of an adult Amia was made 
and covered with black rubber cloth. A freshly killed male fish was 
then trussed up and attached to the end of a stick so that it could 
be moved about in the water. The male was then taken to a nest 
where the larve were about ready to leave and made to pass several 
times over a course leading from the nest to a distance of about a 
meter. The larve soon followed this course and assembled about the 
male. When the model was substituted they paid no attention to it,
-P-A-G-E-138
124 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
should be made of some highly specialized instinctive modes 
of response in fish which have been studied in detail by 
Sumner, Mast, and by several German investigators (Hess, 
Frisch, ete.). These responses are of such a character as to 
make the surface of the animal appear visually like the 
background upon which it rests. While present to some ex- 
tent in other fish, it can best be observed in the flatfish. 
The flounders ordinarily lie on the bottom and the skin 
assumes a color and pattern so nearly like that of their 
environment that it is frequently difficult to see them. 
On a black bottom they become dark; on a white bottom, 
pale. Whether similar changes occur with monochromatic 
light is not so well established. Mast states, however, that 
the fish when placed on a yellow bottom appear yellow; on 
a blue bottom, bluish; on a red bottom, reddish, ete. All 
of these changes in the skin are regulated through the eyes. 
If the bottom is finely mottled the pattern in the skin as- 
sumes a fine grain; if coarsely mottled, it assumes a coarse 
grain. But there is no evidence indicating an actual repro- 
duction of the configuration of the background. If, after 
the skin has become adapted to a given bottom, the fish are 
moved to a different bottom, they tend to return to the 
original. The reflex mechanism by means of which such 
changes are accomplished has not been ascertained (see 
p. 354). 
Results of the experimental study of instincts.—The 
study of the instinctive development of young animals 
reared in captivity has been exceedingly fruitful. The 
results so far accomplished may be considered under one 
of the following heads: 
I. The initial performance of some instinctive acts. 
Il. Serial unfolding of instinctive repertoire of animals. 
A. Guinea pig, 
B. Rat, 
C. Monkey, 
D. Sooty tern. 
III. Quantitative study of improvement of instinctive 
functions. 
IV. Modification of instinct by means of social influences:
-P-A-G-E-139
FIRST PERFORMANCE OF ACTS 125 
V. Hereditary character of certain instinctive traits. 
VI. Waning of instinct; loss through disuse, etc. 
I. The initial performance of some instinctive acts.— 
The current notion of instinct is that it is an act which 
takes place (without previous exercise or training) when- 
ever the proper stimulus is first presented. The common 
notion further states that the instinct, even upon its first 
appearance, is just as perfect as during the later per- 
formances. Under the present heading we wish to take up 
some initial instinctive performances and view them entirely 
apart from the consideration of their perfectness or ac- 
curacy. We shall delay such discussions until p. 138 is — 
reached. Certain scientific writers are inclined to doubt 
even the existence of instincts. To illustrate this type of 
conception we cite the work of C. S. Berry. Some years 
ago he reported that the young of the Manx cat learn to 
eatch and kill mice by imitating the parents. He con- 
cludes that: 
“Cats are credited with more instincts than they really possess. 
It is commonly reported that they have an instinctive liking for mice 
and that mice have an instinctive fear of cats. It is supposed that 
the odor of a mouse will arouse a cat and that the odor of a cat 
will frighten a mouse. My experiments tend to show that this belief 
is not in harmony with the facts. When cats over five months old 
were taken into a room where mice were they did not show the least 
sign of excitement. A cat would even allow a mouse to perch upon 
its back without attempting to injure it, nor did the mouse show 
any fear of the cat. I have seen a mouse smell at the nose of a cat 
without showing any sign of fear.” 
This work of Berry’s did a good deal of violence to the 
common notion of instinct. The later work of Yerkes and 
Bloomfield seems to reéstablish our faith in instinct. They 
made their tests upon two litters of common cats. The 
animals were carefully fed upon milk, beef, usually cooked, 
and fish. They were housed in a room free from mice. In 
the first week of life the kittens showed no special interest 
in mice. Shortly after they gained their sight (12 days 
of age), they were again tested, but the presence of the 
mice did not elicit the instinctive response sought for. 
When slightly over 4 weeks of age, 3 of the first lit- 
ter of 4 failed to exhibit the instinct, as before. One of 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
126 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
the kittens, now, however, exhibited a type of behavior 
quite in contrast with that of the other 3. She noticed 
the mouse soon after it had been placed in the cage, as it 
moved near her, and quickly seized it, growling the while. 
The mouse escaped and the kitten gave chase but failed to 
recapture it before it had climbed to the top of the cage. 
Five days later the kittens were again tested. Nos. 1, 2, 
and 3 acted as before; No. 4, as in the above test, made 
efforts to catch the mouse. Two days later the tests were 
repeated. Kittens 1, 2, and 3 showed a marked interest 
in the mouse, but behaved as in the other tests. No. 4 
exhibited almost a complete repertoire of movements used 
by the adult cat in catching and killing mice. The mouse 
was pursued, caught, worried, killed, and partially eaten. 
The tests were continued upon the remainder of the kittens 
belonging to the same group as No. 4, and upon 4 kittens 
belonging to a second litter. All the animals tested, at 
slightly varying ages, exhibited the characteristic in- 
stinctive behavior of No. 4. The instinct to kill commonly 
appears at about the end of the second month. It may 
appear as early as the first month. Since Berry worked 
with kittens 5 months old it is just possible that his 
negative results were due to the fact that the instinct had 
waned through disuse. 
Two definite things came out of this study: (1) as 
regards method, it shows quite clearly the possibility of 
being able to note the first appearance of an instinct and 
the variation in the time of its appearance among the 
same litter of animals; (2) it shows that the initial per- 
formance of an instinctive act may be fairly complete even 
though the act as a whole is enormously complex. 
One of the most interesting of all responses, performed 
only once in the life of the individual, is that exhibited by 
the young bird in gaining egress from the shell. The 
technique of its method has long been known and may 
be described somewhat as follows: 
“The chick chips the egg a little at a time with its bill, and as it 
does so it turns around inside the egg shell, the axis of its rotation 
being precisely the long axis of the egg. The consequence of this turn-
-P-A-G-E-141
FIRST PERFORMANCE OF ACTS 127 
ing is that the tip of the bill, chipping the shell as it goes, describes 
a very exact circle around the end of the egg, and thus the large end 
of the shell is cut off.*. The time which it takes to finish the cutting 
is very variable. When the opening has been extended nearly or 
quite around the egg, the chick pushes and separates the two sections 
of the shell, tearing in two any shreds of membrane which may have 
been holding them together. Thus the little bird effects its escape.” 
(Craig.) 
It has recently been shown by Craig that the young 
pigeon opens its egg in the same manner as the chick. The 
activity of the young bird actually under observation is 
extremely interesting. We quote from this author: 
“No. 46, April 19, 1911. 8:30 am. My wife found egg chipped 
and called me to see it. While we watched it the young chipped the 
egg about one-third the way round (120°) in about ten minutes. The 
young made a strong movement, then rested for several seconds, then 
made another strong movement, and so on. Each movement seemed 
to consist (1) of pushing out the large end of the egg, i.e., pushing 
lengthwise of the egg; (2) thrusting the bill through the shell, the 
bill coming just far enough to break through, in fact many times 
not breaking through but only bulging the shell; (3) turning around 
a few degrees. We could see this turning through the hole in the 
shell; also we could see that each thrust of the bill appeared a little 
beyond the previous one. With the egg large end up, the turning was 
anti-clock-wise.” 
In the drinking and eating responses of many animals 
we should expect to find a high degree of completeness 
even in the initial performance. Chickens when left to 
develop naturally in the vicinity of water and food usually 
find the water by accidentally pecking at the dish containing 
it. The contact of the water on the beak sets off the rest of 
the mechanism. At times, apparently, drinking may be 
hastened by imitating other chicks. When the intra- 
organic stimulation becomes sufficiently intense, which is 
brought about by keeping the chick from water until the 
third day, almost any form of extra-organic stimulation 
will set off the act of drinking. Under this condition 
neither imitation nor fortuitous pecking at objects in the 
water are necessary to obtain the response. The dove does 
not instinctively give a drinking response to the sound 
8 Breed, however, denies that egress is accomplished mainly by pecking. 
He maintains that lifting movements are chiefly responsible,  
-P-A-G-E-142
128 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
of water or sight, nor to the touch of it on distal parts of 
the body. The young dove, like the chick, gets its bill into 
water probably chiefly by pecking, either at objects in the 
water which attract its attention, or in imitation of the old 
birds. When studied in detail it was found that for the 
first three or four times the bird has accidentally to peck 
at the water and to get it inside the beak before the drink- 
ing response is set up. But on the fourth time and always 
thereafter the response was perfect. Certainly in the case 
of the terns the feeding responses are quite indefinite at 
first, and on the part of many birds it is wholly a passive 
kind of process; the bird merely opens the beak and waits 
until the food is dropped in. 
The young guinea pig is born in a highly developed state. 
Even at the end of the first day the animal is able to eat 
grass, bread and milk, and nibble at a carrot. It is 
able to run around and can find the breast of the mother 
unaided. This is quite in contrast with the case of the white 
rat. The young rat is extremely helpless and the mother 
takes the active part in feeding. : 
In the case of many vertebrates there seem to be no in- 
herent methods of responding actively to different food 
stuffs. The young chick will peck at almost any small ob- 
ject. The young tern, shortly after hatching, will peck at 
its own toes, at small bright objects, and at fecal matter, 
and will even attempt to swallow matches. Even up to 
10 and 12 days after being fed by hand upon minnows, 
they have to be watched constantly to prevent the swallow- 
ing of shells, seaweed, and other objects. 
II. Serial unfolding of instincts in young captive ani- 
mals.—We shall attempt to give in this connection a 
summary of the development of a few animals that have 
been carefully observed in captivity. 
A. Guinea pig.—The guinea pig at birth is well covered 
with hair; its eyes are open; smell, touch, and taste ap- 
parently all function ; movement is not well codrdinated and 
muscular weakness is apparent. It is able to run at birth, 
but after running a short distance and stopping, one leg 
is left sprawling behind it. There is no fear at birth of
-P-A-G-E-143
  SERIAL UNFOLDING OF INSTINCTS 129 
an approaching object, such as the hand held in front of 
the eyes, nor of persons. A shrill squeak, like that of a 
rat, caused first an instantaneous jump with a twitching of 
the muscles. This is the immediate reaction to such a 
stimulus. It may be followed by hiding under the mother: 
A carrot or other vegetable food produces no positive re- 
sponse at birth, but after the end of the first day these 
objects will be eaten. Small guinea pigs put outside of the 
experimental cage in which the mother was placed ran 
around quite freely and contentedly for an hour or more 
without the mother. In one case where the young one was 
removed from the mother for five hours, it gnawed a little 
at the wire. The mother does not seem to be a specific 
stimulus to the young, but after they have been returned 
from an absence of several hours they will seek her and 
suck. At 388 hours, the guinea pig’s squeal, in its 
infantile form, is fully developed. The movements are 
almost as well codrdinated as in the adults; there is great 
activity. The movements around the cage are similar to 
those of the adults when hunting food: the fore-feet creep 
forward, the belly flattens to the ground, and the hind part 
of the body is dragged forward. The peculiar movements 
of the guinea pig, so characteristic in the first three weeks 
of existence, begin to appear on the second day. At the 
age of 62 hours evidence of the mother acting as a 
specific stimulus is given in the act of the young in making 
real attempts to get to her through the wires of the cage. 
The small guinea pigs rarely play together. It is probable 
that the guinea pig at 3 days of age is as mature as the 
white rat at 23 to 27 days of age. 
B. Rat.—In marked contrast to the precocious develop- 
ment of the guinea pig stands that of the white rat. 
First day—The young white rat is born destitute of 
hair. There is no external ear and there is a membrane 
over the eyes. The nose seems to be fairly well developed. 
Their movements, except sucking, are incodrdinated, the 
mother crouching over them. When held in the hand they 
roll up into a ball; when placed on their backs outside of 
the nest they hitch and kick and wriggle over upon the
-P-A-G-E-144
130 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
belly or the side. They are generally unable to maintain 
the belly position for any length of time. When lying upon 
the belly they stretch out their paws in a turtle-like man- 
ner. The tail is often moved. Vocalization consists in a 
clucking sound, a fine high-pitched squeak, and a sort of 
chirp. Avoiding types of reaction are present such as 
brushing and pushing away with the paws; averting the 
head; movement of the whole body, ete. 
It will thus be seen that there is very little that is defi- 
nite in the way of instinctive activity. From birth until 
the fifth day there seems to be a steady increase in motor 
development. But no new instincts appear. 
Fifth day.—The rats crawl with considerable vigor on 
the fifth day. 
Twelfth day—Walk, but unsteadily. Characteristic act 
of ‘‘ face washing ’’ appeared on this day in fairly perfect 
form. 
Fourteenth day—Running, climbing, characteristic 
movement of rearing on hind legs, lifting head, and sniff- 
ing. It is at this age that the young becomes sensitive to 
sounds. 
Fifteenth day.—The eyes open. When removed from 
nest, can run back to mother with great rapidity. Seratch- 
ing in sawdust to get back to mother when entrance was 
closed with sawdust was clearly noted. 
From this period until full sexual maturity is reached, 
about the sixty-fifth day, the development of play activity 
is a most interesting phenomenon to watch. They are ex- 
ceedingly active during this period. Small, from whose 
records the above notes are in part taken, states that the 
whole repertoire of play activity is complete at the 
age of 25 days. He enumerates the play acts as follows: 
running, jumping, climbing, fierce sham fights with biting, 
clawing, running over the mother and biting her ears, dig- 
ging in corners, gnawing at. the cage, sex movements 
(mounting one another—not complete). This catalog of 
play is very incomplete, as Small himself admits. 
Of the instincts-in this animal not exhibited until after 
sexual maturity is reached—such as construction of the
-P-A-G-E-145
Se 
SERIAL UNFOLDING OF INSTINCTS 131 
nest, caring for the young, assembling them, storing food, 
ete.—very little is known. 
C. The monkey.—One is bewildered by the very com- 
plexity of the responses in the young monkey, just as is the 
case in similar observations upon the child. There seems 
to be great progress in the development rather than the 
putting on of very definite instincts at any given 
time. : 
First week.—On the first day the little monkey was very 
still, moving only when forced to do so by the movements of 
the adult. However, certain reflexes seemed to be well 
established even at this age. Those observed were sucking, 
grasping, nuzzling, erying, sneezing, winking (not in re- 
sponse to visual stimuli), incodrdinated movements of the 
legs when the stimulus for grasping was removed; and an 
increased muscular tension of the legs-in response to the 
mother’s movements. During the second day there ap- 
peared to be a slight unadaptive response to sound. (In 
the human infant this varies in the time of appearance from 
the second to the tenth day.) By the third day his strength 
had increased so that his grasp upon his mother’s hair had 
become secure. The head and eyes were at this age first 
turned to follow a moving object. Two days later appeared 
the reflex grasping at a visual object. 
Second week.—By the end of the first week his muscular 
activity was greatly increased, although most of his move- 
ments were still of the non-adaptive type. Complex co- 
ordinated movements of the limbs, as in jumping, appeared, 
as also those connected with reaching out towards moving 
objects. The scratching reflex was established. On the 
eleventh day he reached out and grasped small objects. 
By this time his response to sound indicated some degree 
of localization. On the twelfth day he first attempted to 
walk. The movements were very badly executed and 
showed a lack of codrdination. 
Third week.—The third week, the first week of walking, 
was marked by a tremendous increase in muscular control. 
The movements of the larger muscles of the limbs became 
fairly well adjusted to the demands made upon them. The
-P-A-G-E-146
132 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
first definite play activities appeared with contraction of 
the facial muscles in pursing the lips. 
Fourth week.—Play rapidly changed from simple pull. 
ing and grasping to the more complicated stalking and cap- 
turing of objects in the cage. This was closely connected 
with his increased interest in scraps of solid food, which 
he first attempted to eat at this time. The scratching re- 
flex was perfected. The very complex behavior displayed 
by the adult in this act appeared quite suddenly in the 
young animal. There is some evidence to show that habits 
of reacting to food by sight arose within a few days after 
he first tasted it. 
Fifth week.—Apposition of the thumb and fingers was 
first observed, muscular coérdination spreading periph- 
erally. He attempted to draw the mother into his play. 
Sixth week.—Movements connected with attack and de- 
fense appeared, as shown by his violent attempts to shake 
and tear apart the cage. This is a very characteristic act 
of adults. The thumb was used much more in grasping. 
Seventh week—Movements connected with care of the 
body, removal of insects, ete., were first observed. 
Eighth week—The use of the cheek pouches was ac- 
quired. 
Ninth week.—Different vocal sounds were first distin- 
guished. The method by which they were learned is not 
known, but from their sudden appearance they seem to be 
instinctive rather than imitative. Stroking of the sex 
organs resulting in erection was noted during this week. 
Fifteenth week.—From the tenth to the fifteenth week 
the progress noted was almost entirely motor. Play activi- 
ties were still very marked but unadaptive movements per- 
sisted. 
Approximately one year—The group connected with the 
act of reproduction appeared very suddenly at the age of 
one year. So far as could be seen all of the essential re- 
flexes were perfect. 
D.. Sooty tern.—The young sooty is born in a very 
helpless state. On the 7th of June eight young sooties 
were taken, all born on that day. They differ slightly as
-P-A-G-E-147
  SERIAL UNFOLDING OF INSTINCTS 133 
regards their development. This is due to the fact that the 
birds dwell for varying lengths of time in the shell after it 
has become pipped. In passing through the bushes when 
the birds are beginning to hatch one often hears quite lusty 
“* neeping,’’ and on looking about to find the young bird, 
discovers that the noise comes from birds in the shell. 
“Whether or not they are fed at this age is not known. 
Sometimes they live as long as two days in the shell with 
only the beak protruding. At this stage in their develop- 
ment they make no response to the warning cry of the 
adults as they do later on. They go on ‘‘ peeping ”’ lustily 
after the adults have flown. The peculiar protective atti- 
tude of the young birds has been mentioned already, that is, 
the ability to lie outstretched and perfectly motionless. If 
left for a time in this attitude, they begin to ‘‘ peep ’’ as 
soon as the sun’s rays become oppressive. This means of 
protection persists until locomotion makes possible a more 
effective method. When the protective attitude disappears 
and locomotion becomes possible, the birds run to cover 
when disturbed. Hiding is never in any sense complete; 
indeed, the reaction seems to be almost thygmotactic. The 
moment the young bird ean put its head in the crotch of a 
limb or get its body in contact with some solid object, 
locomotion ceases. 
First day—tThe young birds which were captured showed 
apparent signs of fear. Moving the hand quite rapidly 
near them, as in offering a piece of fish, caused them to 
dodge quite noticeably. The instinctive cry is a lusty 
“* neep-peep.’’ They are well developed but clumsy. The 
wings droop and the birds have difficulty in standing; co- 
ordinated sitting positions are likewise almost impossible. 
The birds are somewhat hard to feed during the first day, 
but after this age the process is easier with them than is 
the case with the noddies of a corresponding age. In the 
case of the sooties, as was not the case with the noddies, the 
mere sight of the food will cause the bird to open its 
beak. Light contact will likewise cause the beak to open. 
Once the food gets into the mouth the rhythmical move- 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
134 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
ments of swallowing follow perfectly. Some locomotion is 
possible. They take a few wobbly steps with wings down 
and legs wide apart. Fairly well codrdinated swimming 
movements are present, but the heavy down with, which they 
are covered soon causes the birds to become waterlogged and 
they sink. As the salt water begins to enter the mouth the 
bird raises its beak higher and higher and shakes out the 
water vigorously, crying lustily the while. One of the 
young birds taken on that day had not emerged from its 
shell; only its beak and the base of the beak protruded (the 
eyes being covered by a membrane). Almost any call from 
the observer would cause this bird to ‘‘ peep.’’ Small 
minnows were offered and swallowed. The contact of the 
minnows caused the beak to open. The shell was removed; 
the bird made adaptive movements as if completing the 
process itself. After removal the bird was very insecure in 
its movements. 
Second day—tThe difference in growth is remarkable. 
Birds can waddle around rapidly and maintain upright 
position fairly well. They follow moving objects with the 
head and eyes quite easily. Will dodge very quickly if 
hand is suddenly extended towards them. Some tendency 
present to nestle under one another, under hands and 
under folds of the cloth. They are beginning to peck at 
one another, the bare wings being the spot usually at- 
tacked. Feeding is quite easy. Moving the finger, fish, or 
bits of straw rapidly across the beak will cause the beak 
to open wide. Whole minnows are swallowed’ with ease. 
The birds sleep a great deal of the time. The adult birds 
flying over the experimental cage and crying are invariably 
answered by a ‘‘ peep ’’ from the young ones. Even on 
the second day feeding is an active process with them. A 
fish dangled in front of them will cause them to strike 
at it. If the beak fastens upon the fish in the center of 
the body the young bird, by a peculiar twist of the head, 
will suddenly right the fish and swallow it head first. It 
is safe to say that at the end of the second day the young 
sooty is sufficiently developed to take any fish from the 
beak of the parent which is likely to be found there. Even
-P-A-G-E-149
  SERIAL UNFOLDING OF INSTINCTS 135 
at this early age the birds are found pecking at one an- 
other’s mouths or at a piece of food which another is 
swallowing. Pecking at one another in a way forceful 
enough to suggest the beginning of the enormously impor- 
tant fighting instinct was, however, not noticed up to this 
time. Any signs of fear which might have been present 
the first day have entirely disappeared by the end of the 
second. 
Third day—tThe birds have begun to run towards the 
observer when he approaches them and calls. They will 
lustily answer his ‘‘ peep ’’ at any hour of the day or 
night. The fighting instinct appeared today in almost 
complete form. Two of the young birds faced each other 
and began striking simultaneously. A firm hold is taken 
on the body and maintained, the victor all the time shak- 
ing his opponent as does the adult. Not the slightest sign 
of play has yet manifested itself. The birds as yet show 
no discrimination as regards what objects they peck at: 
they are as likely to attempt to swallow the finger as the 
fish. Very minute objects, however, such as specks of dirt 
and hairs, are not noticed by them. 
Fourth day.—tThe birds are healthier and larger than 
those in the field. Three birds, 4 days of age, were 
taken from the field to compare with the birds reared in 
captivity. These birds were exceedingly wild. They were 
kept in captivity for 2 or 3 weeks, but while showing im- 
provement in this respect, they never wholly lost their fear 
of the observer. The sleeping and lounging attitudes of 
the first lot captured are very striking. In most cases, 
after a full meal is taken, they go to sleep. When lying 
down one leg (at times both legs) is stuck out so as to 
give the ventral surface of the body contact with the 
ground; head is completely outstretched and laid on one 
~side; eyes are closed. At other times the bird rests: its 
rump on the ground, using the legs as a prop, and dozes 
in this position. As it dozes its head falls to the right or 
to the left or vertically downward between the legs. When 
the beak strikes the ground the eyes are partially opened, 
the head is raised again, and the process is repeated,
-P-A-G-E-150
136 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
Seventh day.—The bird’s feeding movements are won- 
derfully fast. The extremely rapid movements of the 
(live) fish are not more rapid than the movements of their 
beaks. There is little improvement in discrimination to be 
noticed. Today, while feeding some of the birds, a tug was 
felt by the observer from behind, and on turning around 
it was found that one of the birds had swallowed about 3 
inches of his handkerchief and was straining every muscle 
to force the rest down! The young birds were offered 
lemon peel today: it was snapped up by all of them 
greedily. They continued to snap and swallow the lemon 
rind for 3 to 4 trials, and refused thereafter to open the 
beak for it. Fighting is furious and prolonged. The 
young birds are exact replicas of the old in this respect. 
All that is necessary to start a fight is for one bird to come 
within striking distance of another. 
Eighth day.—The young birds began to dig holes in the 
sand, using exactly the same movements which are em- 
ployed by the adults in digging the nest, exeept that the 
young birds do not shape the hole with the breast as the 
adults do the nest. By digging such a hole the bird se- 
cures a surface which is damp and cool. The holes are 
usually dug near some solid object, whether because of 
greater coolness there (temperature reaction), or through 
some thygmotactic tendency (tactual reaction) we are not 
able to state. A new instinctive reaction was observed 
today which is continued from this time on. <A bird stand- 
ing still will suddenly hop an inch or two in the air and 
come down in the same spot (first step in flying?). De- 
tailed records of the development of these birds were kept 
until they were 30 days of age, but on account of the great 
similarity of these later records to the above, we shall not 
cite them in detail. Experiments on learning to respond 
adaptively to the common objects in the environment 
were made from day to day, but all such tests gave results 
very similar to those which have already been described. 
After the birds had learned to pick up fish from a dish, 
it was possible to put seaweed, grass, bits of coral, ete., 
in with the fish, At first these were taken eagerly, but
-P-A-G-E-151
SERIAL UNFOLDING OF INSTINCTS 137 
after a few trials the birds learned to take the fish and 
leave the debris. Such habits, however, never became 
very accurate. When very hungry the birds would attack 
objects other than the fish. It may be found of interest 
in this connection to say a few words about the way the 
young birds in captivity and those in the field spend the 
greater part of their time. We have already remarked 
upon the fact that there are no signs of play. This was as 
nearly true of the birds in the field as of those observed in 
captivity. The only reaction which it is at all possible to 
consider a playful one is the one already mentioned, viz., 
the frequent hopping up and flapping of the wings. It is 
a question whether Gross’ theory of play after all fits the 
facts in any genus of animals except that of mammals. 
Certainly the facts which we could gather both with ref- 
erence to the noddy and sooty terns do not lend support to 
this theory. These birds certainly lead an instinctively 
complex life. Surely the picking up of a live fish darting 
over the surface of the water is as complex an act as the 
catching of a mouse. And yet it is impossible to practise’ 
this act in play. Probably the instinct is perfectly and 
completely called out the first time the birds see a minnow 
darting over the surface of the water. The birds spend 
the greater part of their time in doing absolutely nothing. 
They will lie outstretched in their sand holes, getting up 
at times to stand stock still for an hour or more, or to doze 
with head bent down. At intervals they peck at their feet 
and occasionally preen their feathers. In the field the 
routine is broken by the call from the parents which have 
returned to feed the young. At other times the young 
birds get hungry. At such times they begin to ery lustily 
and go up to the parent (which is likewise standing or 
fighting in the neighborhood) and beg for food by ‘‘ peep- 
ing ’’ and by striking at the parent’s beak. Getting noth- 
ing, the young birds will wander off for 10 or 15 feet and 
lie down again in the shade. Frequently they engage in 
fighting with other young birds. Occasionally they will 
attack adult noddies which drop down to gather sticks. 
The young sooty never attacks an adult sooty. As the birds 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
138 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
get older they begin to fly short distances. At the end of 
35 days they can cover 30 to 40 feet very rapidly by a 
series of flying hops. 
III. Quantitative study of improvement of instinc- 
tive function—Under I we considered the initial per- 
formance of several instinctive acts. Much has been said 
and written about the degree of perfectness of such acts 
and about the rapidity of their rate of improvement when 
exercised. Within recent years efforts have been made 
to obtain a quantitative report on the initial accuracy of 
such acts and their rate of improvement. 
Breed has presented an interesting investigation of the 
pecking reaction of the chick. For purposes of study he 
divides the act into (1) missing, (2) striking, (3) seizing, 
and (4) swallowing. The curves showing the rate of im- 
provement in swallowing (4) are the most instructive and 
interesting in this connection, since under the term swal- 
lowing he includes the whole reaction, i.e., successful strik- 
ing, seizing, and swallowing in any errorless chain of 
movements. On the second day the chick is presented with 
small grains at which it begins to peck. The number of 
correct reactions the chick makes in 50 attempts to take 
up the grains is noted. The same routine is repeated each 
day for 25 days. Thus it was found that the average 
number of correct (complete) responses obtainable on the 
second day in one group was 10.3; on the third day, 28.3; 
on the seventh day, 38.3; on the sixteenth day, 43.2. Ini- 
tial accuracy of the whole act is thus low, but the increase 
during the first few days of practice is enormous. Fig. 29, 
eurve IV-E, portrays the result Breed obtained from a 
group of 6 chicks. (In the same figure, curve IV-F, is 
shown a similar set of records of chicks, which had been 
allowed to watch the pecking of older birds. This curve 
will be discussed on p. 141.) 
Granting that we can measure the degree of accuracy 
and general perfectness of an instinctive act, the question 
of interpretation still arises. Lacking experimental evi- 
dence, it is easily possible for one to affirm that the in- 
crease of the perfectness of the act comes not by virtue of
-P-A-G-E-153
  
  QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF INSTINCT = 139 
the exercise or practice of the function, but rather by 
maturation of the sensory motor ares (including here de- 
velopmental or growth processes in receptor, system of 
conductors, and the effector). The obvious way to control 
these factors is to prevent those arcs from functioning 
until maturation in them has partially advanced. We can

Distances along axis of abscisse represent days of age; distances 
along axis of ordinates, the number of a given type of reaction in a 
daily series of fifty pecking reactions. Curves III-E and III-F show 
respectively the rate of decrease in the number of reaction 3 for 
groups E and F; curves IV-E and IV-F show the improvement in 
accuracy of reaction 4 for the same groups. (After Breed, Behavior 
Monograph, Ser. No. 1, p. 31.) 
then test the accuracy of the function under the two condi- 
tions of practice and non-practice. The comparison of 
the two sets of records ought to enable us to separate the 
increment due to practice from that due to maturation. 
Some experiments have been made with this object in 
view: Fig. 30 shows the development of the normal 
pecking reaction in chicks and the development where 
pecking has been artificially prevented for 3, 4, and 5 
days previous to the first tests. The curves were obtained 
in a way similar to the ones just discussed. The number 
of perfect, complete reactions were recorded in each daily 
set of 50 trials. It will be seen that the standard curve 
(S), beginning on the second day, shows that the average

number of correct responses on that day was 8.7; on the 
seventh day, 36.7; on the twentieth day, 40.8. This stand- 
ard curve is based on the average of 21 chicks. Curve I 
shows what happens when pecking is prevented for 3 days; 
eurve III likewise for 3 days; curve IV, for 4 days; and 
curve V, for 5 days. During the days in which pecking

was prevented, the animals were watered and fed artificially 
and confined to the dark room. In general it may be seen 
from these curves that the initial efficiency is low in every 
ease, no matter what length of time is allowed for matura- 
tion. The number of normal responses on the first day 
(i.e., when the chicks were 2 days of age) was 8.7 out of a 
possible 50. The average number of perfect responses in 
the group in which pecking was prevented for 1 day was 
5.5; for 2 days, 3.1; for 4 days, 8.7; and for 5 days, 2. No 
one could have predicted that a 5-day-old chick, prevented 
from previous pecking, would start in with an accuracy no
-P-A-G-E-155
EFFECT OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE 141 
greater than that found in chicks 24 hours of age. The 
next interesting point in the tests on the chicks which were 
prevented from pecking appears when it is seen that the 
curves showing their rate of improvement very quickly ad- 
vance to the level of the standard (S), only 2 days of 
practice as a rule being necessary to effect this From 
these experiments it seems safe to conclude that the enor- 
mous increase in the accuracy of pecking during the first 
three or four days, which is always observable in chicks 
which are brought up under normal conditions, is due to 
the effect of practice as we ordinarily understand the term. 
IV. Modification of instinct through social influ- 
ences.—Several interesting experiments have been carried 
out on young birds to show the types of song and call notes 
which they exhibit when reared in isolation from adults of 
their own species, and to show the effects of the song and 
call notes of a given species upon the young of another 
species. It is admitted by all that the various birds, such 
as the robin, the bobolink, and the oriole, when reared 
* These writers hold that a given amount of practice is necessary 
to smooth the way for the operation of a native capacity whose 
efficiency is largely a function of the age of the animal. They hold 
that such a curve has two parts—the early state (2 days of practice) 
showing effects of practice; the latter stage (from this point on, 
where a slow but steady increase in accuracy is shown) showing the 
slow process of maturation. This conclusion is surely questionable 
and certainly confusing. The curve exhibits what every habit curve 
in animals shows, i.e., a rapid initial increase in efficiency and then 
a slow increase until the level of no further improvement is reached. 
Unless the writers are willing to admit that the latter part of every 
habit curve is illustrative of maturation, it seems useless to use such 
a terminology here. They may intend to imply this; but what such 
“maturation” would mean in the case of habit formation in the 
adult is not clear. The authors are not quite consistent in the use 
of the term anyway. In the beginning of the article one gets the 
idea that they mean what one commonly would mean by it, i.e., 
actual growth, increase in size and length of conductors, possible 
increase in the number of connections, increase in size and efficiency 
of the effector, etc., and possibly certain structural growth of the 
receptors. In the latter part of the article, they use it without 
giving the reader a clear idea of how they would define it. These 
growth processes may influence the rate of improvement in the func- 
tion whose accuracy they measured, but the writers offer no real 
evidence of it, since exactly the same results are obtained whenever 
habit curves are recorded.

142 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT ~ 
in the field by the parents, possess songs which are char- 
acteristic. Until recent years it was supposed that the 
characteristic songs of birds were inherited, like instincts. 
Apparently this is not wholly true. It would seem from 
the work of Scott and Conradi that what the birds inherit 
is a strong tendency to sing, but that no characteristic 
song develops without training. What are inherited are 
throat formation and vocal apparatus suitable to produce 
the song of the race if the bird is thrown under the proper 
influences (habit). Scott isolated Baltimore orioles before 
they had heard any of the songs of their species. He ob- 
served the birds for a number of years. They became very 
gentle in their artificial environment. The early vocal 
reflexes were quite similar to those of the wild birds, e.g., 
the single call note, the peculiar rattling chatter, ete. The 
birds finally became good singers. During certain seasons 
of the year song was incessant. ‘‘ It was now a loud clear 
series of notes of great brilliancy, poured forth in such 
rapid succession as to be like that of the house wren 
(T. aédon) in the intervals, and lasting about as long as 
the warble of that bird. Except for the rattle, which was 
now and then a part of the repertoire, this song had noth- 
ing in it that reminded one of the song of the Baltimore 
oriole as heard in New York, Massachusetts, or at any 
other point where the birds oceur.’’? The birds dwelling 
thus in isolation developed a song of their own. The ex- 
perimenter next put a young brood of Baltimore orioles 
6 days of age to live with 2 adult birds that had 
been brought up in isolation. This young brood began 
to sing at the proper age, but to sing the song of their 
2 adult associates. This same author found very great 
modification in the songs of the various species of birds 
when some 15 to 16 different species were brought up to- 
gether and within hearing of one another’s songs and the 
songs and call notes of their neighbors on the outside of 
the aviary. Some of the birds were more resistant to such 
influences than others. The robin had what Scott called 
an invented song. The wood-thrush’s song, while varying - 
much from the normal, was not original. All of the cat- 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
EFFECT OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE 143 
birds showed mimicry of the songs of other birds. In par- 
ticular he found a yellow-breasted chat learning to imitate 
the postman’s whistle with such a degree of accuracy that 
the experimenter was often deceived. One of the red-wing 
blackbirds crowed constantly for two months in the year. 
The crow was in imitation of the crow of a bantam rooster. 
Conradi reared a young English sparrow in the same room 
with canaries. The regular sparrow chirp developed at 
the proper time, although the bird had never heard this 
chirp from the outside. Probably under the influence of 
his canary-bird environment, he lost the chirp and took 
on the peep similar to the peep of the young canaries. 
‘When the bird was about three and a half months old ‘‘ he 
constantly chimed in with the canaries in his own fashion, 
giving a low note followed by a few high notes, with now 
and then some slurring from a high to a low note, similar 
to the notes the canaries have in their overtures. He joined 
the canaries freely for a few days, when he became ill and 
was silent for a week.’’ Two weeks later he again joined 
the canary chorus. In general Conradi says that the spar- 
row’s efforts resembled the confusion of notes which oc- 
eurred when all three of his adult canaries were singing 
at their best. These experiments were repeated upon other 
sparrows, in some cases even with more marked success. 
The sparrows so trained by the canaries were then removed 
to a place where they would be away from the canaries 
and under the influence of a group of sparrows which 
frequented that part of the building. They rapidly lost 
their canary notes and readopted a considerable part of the 
sparrow chirp. Nevertheless, their voices remained more 
musical than those of the untrained sparrows. When again 
placed under the influence of the canaries they rapidly re- 
gained what they had lost. 
Breed carried out some experiments upon the chick to 
determine the effect of social influence upon the develop- 
ment of the pecking instinct. In the one case the chick 
was allowed to develop its pecking instinct in isolation; 
in another, the chick was allowed to develop the pecking 
reaction where it could watch the pecking of older birds. In
-P-A-G-E-158
144 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
general it was found that the effect of social influence was 
practically nil in increasing the rate of improvement in 
accuracy of the pecking reaction. Curve IV-F, Fig. 29, 
p. 139, shows the growth of the reaction where tuition is 
allowed; curve IV-E where tuition is denied. In general 
the two curves are closely similar. Apparently both the 
dove and the chick are influenced to some extent by their 
mates, so far as the initiation of the drinking and pecking 
instincts is concerned, i.e., when two or three chicks 
out of a brood begin to either peck or drink, the act serves 
as a stimulus and causes the others to engage in the same 
activity. 
V. Hereditary character of certain instinctive acts 
and traits——Yerkes has so far made the only contribution 
bearing directly upon the heredity of instinctive acts and 
traits. He has recently tested the heritability of savage- 
ness, wildness, and timidity in certain strains of rats. He 
first tested the rats and graded them with respect to the 
presence of these traits. On regrading after an interval of 
several days he found that the judgment as to the grades of 
savageness or wildness remained almost constant. 
Savageness was indicated. by (1) biting; (2) exposing 
or gnashing the teeth; (3) jumping at hand or forceps; (4) 
squeaking. Wildness by (1) attempts to hide from view in 
cage or in hand; (2) random or excited running about in 
the cage or excited attempts to escape from the hand or 
forceps; (3) squeaking; (4) urination and defecation. 
Timidity by (1) attempts to avoid the experimenter; (2) 
by a kind of chattering or gnashing of the teeth; (3) by 
cowering and what looks like trembling; (4) urination and 
defecation. Timidity is possibly not sharply enough 
marked off from the other traits to measure it quantita- 
tively. 
The wild rats possessing these traits were then mated 
with strains of tame rats which had been bred in the 
Harvard laboratory for at least 10 years. The offspring 
(F,) from these crosses were tested, as likewise the progeny 
(F,) obtained by mating the individuals of F, among 
themselves. Yerkes holds that his tests show conclusively
-P-A-G-E-159
  
  WANING OF INSTINCTS 145 
that savageness, wildness, and timidity are heritable be- 
havior complexes.’ This same author tested the heritabil- 
ity of the mode of whirling in the dancing mouse. The 
dancers may be classified into right, left, and mixed whirl- 
ers. In one line of descent (No. 400) he found the 
tendency to whirl to the left was heritable. 
In view of observations of Franz that certain monkeys 
arg left-handed and certain others right-handed, it would 
be interesting to test the heritability of the preferential 
use of right or left hand. 
VI. Waning of instinct: loss through disuse, etc.— 
In the case of. mammals one instinct common to many 
species exhibits the process of waning very clearly. This 
instinct in question is that of carrying the young from 
place to place in the mouth. The following quotation is 
taken from one of the author’s early observations upon 
the white rat: 
“Within the last two days (when young were from 12 to 14 days 
of age) a change has come over the mother. When the rats were 10 
days old the mother would become frantic if one of them were taken 
beyond her grasp. At 14 days of age she was not at all worried 
when I took one of them out for an experiment. Indeed for two days 
past she has not received the young rats in her mouth when they 
entered the cage, but has allowed them to scramble through the 
straw to her as best they could.” 
While this instinct wanes as the general cycle of instincts 
changes, it reappears with all its vigor on the birth of the 
next litter of young. The process of weaning in nearly 
every case is a gradual one. We have under observation 
a young monkey (M. rhesus) nearly 18 months of age 
which is still nursing. There is no actual necessity for 
nursing longer than 18 weeks (even less). 
There are no reliable observations which have been 
experimentally controlled on the loss of instinct through 
disuse. The case of the Scotch terrier attempting to bury 
food in the carpet and then finally giving over the attempt 
on all subsequent occasions has often been cited. The 
* Yerkes’ complete report has not yet appeared. 
° An interesting case of elaboration of this instinct to bury food 
appears in an observation made by Frost (Journal of Animal Be- 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
146 STUDIES UPON INSTINCT 
observation comes from William James. The observation, 
so far as it goes, is unquestionably true, but there is no 
evidence ‘that the instinct is lost. Given the proper en- 
vironment and the proper conditions of hunger, and we 
should expect to see the instinct reappear in all its pristine 
vigor. In the further case cited by Mr. James, viz., that 
of the young goslings kept away from water, a similar lack 
of control in the experiment is apparent. Spalding, who 
made the test, states that when the goslings were reared 
in a kitchen away from water until they were several 
months old and then taken to a pond, they not only refused 
to go into the water but scrambled back to the bank the 
moment they were thrown into it. It is quite possible that 
if Spalding had taken goslings that had been reared in 
the water and tossed them in in this way, they would 
have done exactly the same thing. There is room for in- 
teresting work upon this question. That instincts are 
overlapped and obscured by later habits is unquestionable. 
Whether this process of obscuration results finally in the 
complete elimination of the instinct is certainly not proven 
by any observation we have in the field at the present time.

Introduction.—In the preceding chapter we dealt with 
certain activities on the part of the animal which do not 
have to be learned. We intimated there that such activities 
or instincts appear because of the fact that the animal 
is born with certain systems of ares ready to function in 
serial order the moment the appropriate stimulus appears 
(as has been brought out, many such systems are not ready 
to function until definite intervals after birth). We wish 
now to consider especially the origin of such structures. 
It can readily be seen, since instincts are but the func- 
tioning of certain preformed structures, that, any consid- 
eration of the origin of the special structures underlying 
them must inevitably involve a consideration of the origin 
of the whole organism. It is not our purpose to enter the 
field of experimental evolution except for the purpose of 
bringing out certain facts which appear to be helpful in 
envisaging our own problems. One such group of facts 
which especially concerns the behaviorist comes from em- 
bryology.

  EARLY DIFFERENTIATION OF PARTS 149 
Early differentiation of parts.—HEmbryology teaches us 
but little of the early differentiation and growth of par- 
ticular reflex arcs. In regard to the larger divisions of 
the nervous system the case is different. The investiga- 
tions of Harrison, Lewis, Spemann, Hooker, and others 
show that the gross development of neural structure is

determined early in the course of embryonic development 
and progresses to a large extent independently of the 
changes which occur in other organs. Spemann’s experi- 
ments bring this out with great clearness. He cut out 
small pieces from the floor of the medullary plate of the 
frog embryo and replaced them in a reversed position so 
that the end which before had been anterior was now 
posterior. The embryos continued to develop; the neural

these brains showed marked abnormalities. In many cases 
two sets of optic cups were produced and the normal rela- 
tion of parts within the brain was much disturbed. The 
structures produced were those which the reversed tissue

would have produced if undisturbed, but their positions 
were now reversed. 
“The gross form relations of the grafted pieces naturally undergo 
a certain amount of modification at their boundaries but the recog- 
nizable portions retain even here their peculiar tendencies to develop-

ment. The finer differentiation proceeds, not only in the middle of 
the reversed piece but even at the borders where the cells have been 
brought into new and abnormal relations. For some time there is a 
distinct boundary along which the different tissues may be distin- 
guished by their appearance. Thus it follows that both the gross 
relationships and the finer differentiation of individual parts of the 
brain are already determined in the open medullary plate.” 
Fig. 32 shows such a brain. For comparison a normal 
brain is also given. 
Not only have the various parts of the nervous system 
this early independence of development but the extra- 
neural structures as well. Goldfarb destroyed the spinal 
cord of the newt in the lumbo-sacral region together with 
the sensory ganglia of the nerves of this region, thus cut- 
ting off entirely the nerve supply of the hind legs. Re- 
generation occurred in such animals just as in normal ones, 
growth and differentiation of the regenerating foot taking 
place in some cases after the complete degeneration of all 
nerve elements of the leg. Growth of neural and extra- 
neural structures thus seems to be relatively independent. 
It is thus clear that one result of a great part of the work in 
experimental embryology has been the establishment of the 
fact that many of the final details of the structure of the 
adult are already determined in the early cleavage stages of 
the egg before any differentiation can be recognized. It 
would seem from this that we can safely assume that what 
is true of the gross anatomical structure of the brain and 
nerves is also true of the microscopic structures, of the posi- 
tion, number, and possible interconnections of the neurones, 
ie., of the reflex arcs. If this is true it means that the 
special systems of ares underlying instinctive activity are 
predetermined in some way in the egg. It is probable, 
furthermore, that at the birth of the animal or soon after- 
wards all possible nervous connections are already estab- 
lished and that all later development—all adjustments of 
the animal to changes in its environment by habit forma- 
tion involve only changes in resistance through various 
- inherited arcs. Thus the possible habits which an organ- 
ism may acquire are limited by its nervous structures,

I. Herepiry: rue Concepr or Unir CHaracters 
Unit characters.—These embryological studies from the 
standpoint of our very special interests teach us little more 
than that the structure which must later develop into the 
anatomical mechanism of instinct is already present in 
the fertilized egg of the given species. They teach us little 
about the process by means of which one egg will produce 
a mammal, another a bird, or of the manner in which one , 
chick forms white feathers and another barred. Or put in 
another way, how it comes about that one mammalian egg 
will develop into a form which will possess the structures 
involved in catching and killing mice, and another egg will 
develop into a form which will gnaw down trees and con- 
struct a dam. Nevertheless, in spite of our ignorance of 
the way in which such differences are produced, it has been 
found possible to determine beforehand, from a considera- 
\ tion of the characters of the parents, many characters 
| which will appear in the new-born animal. This may be 
\ illustrated by numerous examples. Possibly an illustra- 
tion of the inheritance of combs in the domestic fowl will 
be best for our purpose. Three types of combs are com- 
monly met with. The most common type is the’ single 
comb, which is high, relatively narrow, and deeply toothed 
(Fig. 833—A). The second type, the pea comb, is smaller, 
less notched, and is ridged lengthwise (Fig. 33—B and C). 
_ The third type is the rose comb, flat, broad, triangular, and 
7 covered with numerous papille (Fig. 33—D). When fowls 
\ bearing pea combs are crossed with others bearing single 
ones their progeny all have pea combs. In the next gen- 
- eration obtained by interbreeding these hybrids the single 
comb appears again in one-fourth of the birds. The re- 
maining three-fourths have pea combs. The same thing 
occurs when rose and single combed birds are crossed. 
Their progeny will have rose combs and when interbred 
will produce rose and single combed birds in the propor- 
tions of three to one. When rose and pea combed birds 
are crossed the results are, in the first generation, quite 
different, The progeny have neither rose nor pea combs,

but an entirely new type which consists of an irregular 
fleshy knob at the front of the head, the back of the head 
being rather bare, the so-called walnut comb (Fig 33—E). 
When walnut combed fowls are interbred they give walnut, 
pea, rose, and single combed progeny in the proportions of 
9:3:3:1. There are some irregularities in the proportions, 
and the mechanism by which they are brought about is too

complicated to be entered into here. The important fact 
for our present purpose is that when the progeny of any 
cross are interbred among themselves, they produce in their 
progeny not only their own type, but also that of both 
their parents, and in quite definite proportions. The char- 
acters do not lose their identity in hybrids but reappear 
unchanged in later generations and appear, moreover, in 
definite proportions which may be determined empirically. 
The example of the fowls illustrates Mendel’s law of segre- 
gation and heredity, the principle of which may best be

shown by a brief summary of some of its discoverer’s own 
experiments. 
  MENDEL’s EXPERIMENTS: Mendel bred different varieties of com- 
mon garden peas and studied, among other characters, the form and 
coloration of the seeds. When he bred plants from varieties bearing 
smooth seeds with others from varieties bearing wrinkled seeds, he 
found that all the seeds produced from this cross mating were smooth. 
The character of wrinkledness seemed to have been lost entirely. 
But the next generation, grown from these seeds, when interbred 
among themselves gave 7,324 seeds, of which 5,474 were round and 
1,850 were wrinkled; a proportion of about 3 to 1. The character 
of wrinkledness had not been lost completely but had only withdrawn 
from observation. Each of the two characters retained its own in- 
dividuality in the cross. In the next generation from these plants 
Mendel found that wrinkled seeds produced only wrinkled ones; the 
smooth seeds gave rise to plants of two sorts. One-third of them 
gave plants which produced only smooth seeds even after several 
generations of close inbreeding; the remaining two-thirds produced 
both smooth and wrinkled seeds and again in the proportion of 3 to 1. 
They were in all respects like the first generation hybrids. 
If we suppose that the two characters are absolutely 
independent of each other, that either one or both may be 
present potentially in the organism, and that the presence 
of one, roundness, hides the presence of the other, these 
proportions may be explained. The first generation 
hybrids receive from one parent the capacity to be round, 
from the other the capacity to be wrinkled. The round- 
ness prevails in this generation, but the thing which causes 
wrinkledness, the determiner, persists unchanged though 
hidden. When the adults of this generation produce new 
germ cells, these germ cells may receive either determiner 
for roundness or that for wrinkledness, not for both. 
Since all the hybrids produce both egg cells and pollen 
grains containing both determiners in equal numbers, all 
possible pairing of the determiners may occur in the fer- 
tilized eggs, i.e., individuals may be formed having either 
two determiners for roundness; one determiner for round- 
ness and one for wrinkledness; or two for wrinkledness. 
Those which contain any determiner for roundness will be 
round, so that only one in every four pairings will be 
wrinkled. These relations can best be shown by the con- 
sideration of a simple diagram,

The above diagram illustrates the explanation which has been 
advanced to account for the proportions obtained when individuals 
differing with respect to a single character are crossed, as in the case 
of the peas. The circles may be considered as smoothness and 
the squares as wrinkledness. The first three lines, I, II, and 
III, show the condition of reproduction in lines breeding true to 
type. A and B represent the two types, each of which can give off 
germ cells of its own type only (II, ab and ed). So long as the 
individuals of each line are bred separately they can produce only 
the combinations ab and cd. But when the two lines are crossed, 
every germ cell of A unites with a germ cell of B to produce an 
individual having determiners for both snfoothness and wrinkledness 
(C). All the individuals of this first hybrid yeneration will have 
the same make-up and all will be alike in appearance. Although 
both characters are present in.this hybrid generation, one is hidden 
by the other, as the square is enclosed by the circle, so that, in ex- 
ternal form, the individuals of type .C are not to be distinguished 
from type A. When individuals of type C produce germ cells, they 
produce equal numbers containing the determiners for each of their 
characters, as is indicated in VI, a, b, ec, d. When equal numbers 
of the two kinds of germ cells unite by chance, the result will be as 
indicated in VII. The possible combinations are ac, ad, be, bd, which 
produce one of type A, two of type C, and one of type B, the propor- 
tions of 3 to 1, which Mendel obtained with peas, since types A and 
C are not distinguishable from their external form. When two or 
more pairs of characters are involved, as greenness versus yellowness,
-P-A-G-E-170
  156 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
roundness versus wrinkledness, each pair is found to be inherited, 
as in the above example, but the two pairs are found to be independ- 
ent of each other, so that they occur in all possible combinations: 
green-wrinkled, green-smooth, yellow-wrinkled, and yellow-smooth. 
In such a case the proportions obtained are 9 yellow-smooth, 3 
yellow-wrinkled, 3 green-smooth, and 1 green-wrinkled. These are 
the proportions already mentioned in connection with the walnut 
combs of fowls and the proportions to be expected from the laws of 
chance. 
Further details of the process, blending inheritance (as 
in the walnut comb), linkage of characters, and the struc- 
tural basis of the process of inheritance need not be en- 
tered into here. Certain important features may be em- 
phasized. First: the parts, organs, or characters of the 
plant or animal are to a great extent independent in in- 
heritance (hair color may be inherited from one parent 
and hair form from the other). Second: the characters 
are not altered in their passage from one generation to 
the next; they may blend together in the hybrid, as the 
rose and pea combs blend to form the walnut comb, but 
they will separate eventually into the component parts. 
Some attempts have been made to apply these laws to 
behavior complexes, but as yet psychology has provided 
little foundation for such studies. The most thorough- 
going attempts have been made with human mental 
traits and some evidence has been collected here in 
favor of the view that differences in the instinctive 
behavior of individuals are inherited according to Men- 
delian ratios. But in the field of human psychology too 
little is known of the genesis of character, of the dis- 
tinction between native and acquired behavior, to provide 
a very firm foundation for the work of the geneticist. A 
few studies of the inheritance of some more readily deter- 
mined characters have been made upon animals. On p. 144 
we presented the work of Yerkes on the direction of whirl- 
ing in the dancer and upon the inheritance of the in- 
stinctive traits of boldness, timidity, ete., in the rat. 
Certain studies have also been made upon the inheritance 
of wildness in ducks. Kammerer has found that certain 
variations in the brooding instincts of the obstetrical toad

are inherited in Mendelian ratios. None of the other studies 
has been carried far enough to show that the traits 
studied reappear in the offspring in Mendelian ratios. 
II. Oriermn or Diversities IN ORGANISMS 
Introduction.—The laws of heredity thus far considered 
apply only to the transmission of characters already present 
in the organism. They say nothing as to the origin of 
these characters, yet the wide diversity of instincts with 
which the behaviorist is constantly confronted suggests, per- 
haps first of all, the question: how could such diverse forms 
of behavior have come into existence? This is_a part of 
the problem of evolution, of which Bateson says, summing 
up the work bearing upon the question: 
“The many converging lines of evidence point so clearly to the 
central fact of the origin of the forms of. life by an evolutionary 
process that we are compelled to accept this deduction, but as to 
almost all the essential features, whether of cause or mode, by which 
specific diversity has become what we perceive it to be, we have to 
confess an ignorance nearly total.” 
While the origin of a new race or type of animals has 
been observed in but few cases (and some writers are in- 
clined to believe that even these are not truly new, but 
merely the reappearance of something already present but 
hidden), the indirect evidence obtained from comparative 
anatomy, embryology, and historical geology is so complete 
as to leave no room for doubt that new forms are con- 
stantly arising from the old, by some process the details 
of which are not yet clear. 
In the present incomplete stage of the problem it will 
be impossible to reach any final conclusion as to the man- 
ner in which evolution has taken place. At best we can 
but point out the paths of investigation which promise to 
yield the solution of the problem, and summarize (very 
incompletely) the evidence which has been collected in 
support of the various theories as to how new characters 
arise. The first students of evolution sought to find the 
method of origin of new species, of groups of animals dif- 
fering rather markedly from other groups, usually with
-P-A-G-E-172
    158 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
respect to several characters. The results of Mendelian 
experiments have changed this point of view in great 
measure. The student of evolution is now concerned 
chiefly with the origin of single new characters, of ‘‘ unit 
characters,’’ such as the wrinkledness of the pea or the 
single comb of the fowl. Davenport says of this: 
“ The fact that most characteristics are not necessarily associated— 
that they may occur in various combinations—certainly accounts 
for the multiplicity of ‘varieties’ in domesticated species; and for 
much of the variation in feral species. Moreover, it probably ac- 
counts for the presence of many ‘ species’ in a genus.” 
In order to recognize the origin of a new character, it 
is necessary that the experimenter be thoroughly familiar 
with the normal conditions in a small group of related 
organisms. Not only must he know what characters are 
present visibly in the bodies or soma of his material, but he 
must know also what characters are potentially present 
in their germ cells, as recessives in the Mendelian sense. 
Students of variations have accomplished this in investiga- 
tions of many morphological characters, such as hair color 
in mice; but students of behavior have been lax in analyz- 
ing and recording the many individual differences in in- 
stinctive behavior which have come to their attention. The 
few studies of variation in instinct which have thus far been 
completed have given results of considerable importance 
for theories of evolution. Practically all of the work has 
been done by students of the inheritance of acquired char- 
acters and will be considered with the evidence bearing 
upon this problem. Owing to the lack of material in the 
field of behavior, it will be necessary to base our discus- 
sion of the method of the origin of variations upon morpho- 
logical studies of extra-neural structure, disregarding, for 
the moment, the difference between structure and_be- 
havior; or rather, assuming that there is no fundamental 
difference between the two, since, ultimately, all behavior 
must be looked upon as the functioning of structure. 
Darwin’s conception of variations.—Recent studies of 
| variation, with advancing knowledge of the mechanism of 
\ heredity, have shown clearly that not all diversities (varia-
-P-A-G-E-173
  ORIGIN OF DIVERSITIES 159 
tions) are of the same nature either with respect to causa- 
tion or heritability. This fact was perceived vaguely 
by the early investigators, but they did not understand its 
full significance. Darwin distinguished at least two kinds 
of variations: the so-called continuous ones, constantly ex- 
hibited by all organisms, slight differences of size, pro- 
portion, depth of pigmentation, ete., in which continuous 
series may be recognized; and discontinuous variations, 
sports or monsters which appear suddenly, differ rather 
widely from the racial type, and show no intermediate 
stages. He considered this latter class as of little sig- 
nificance in evolution, as mere accidents of nature, of too 
rare occurrence or of too extreme a form to affect the 
course of development of species. The former class, he 
believed, furnished the differences, which, preserved and 
fixed by natural selection, formed the basis for new varie- 
ties. Concerning the cause of these variations he was 
uncertain, but inclined to ascribe them to some funda- 
mental property of living matter, of, equal rank with irri- 
tability or with the power of reproduction itself. 
Continuous variation due to the direct action of en- 
vironment upon the developing organism.—It is now gen- 
erally admitted that continuous variation is due to the di- 
rect action of the environment upon the body or soma of 
the developing organisms. If large numbers of individuals 
of any pure race of animals or plants are considered, it will 
be found that the greatest number of them are nearly alike, 
. forming the racial average, while the variants in the two 
- directions from the racial average grow proportionately 
fewer, with an increasing degree of variation. This con- 
dition may be illustrated by a group of measurements of 
the size of bean seeds descended from a single individual 
(a pure line)—taken from the measurements of Johannsen.

160 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
  As was first shown by Quetelet, the distribution of such 
variations around the racial average follows the law of 
chance distribution. The effect of environment upon the 
production of variation in the soma can be seen quite 
clearly in the following investigations of Stockard, Fuld, 
and Cunningham. Stockard has shown that while the eggs 
of the fish (Fundulus) under ordinary conditions produce 
normal two-eyed fish, the addition of magnesium salts to 
the water causes them to develop into Cyclopean mon- 
sters.. Some of the changes are apparently of such a na- 
ture as to make the animal better fitted to meet the demands 
of its environment. Thus, Fuld found that dogs which 
had their forelegs removed during the first year of life 
later showed changes in the proportion of the femur and 
tibia of the hind-legs which mimicked the normal con- 
ditions in leaping animals of the type of the hare. Cun- 
ningham illuminated the ventral surface of young floun- 
ders, which are normally unpigmented there, and induced 
the formation of pigment. 
The non-inheritance of continuous variation.—The be- 
lief that continuous variations of the type considered are 
inherited was shared by all investigators up to recent times. 
The whole Darwinian theory of evolution is based upon 
this concept. In 1903 the heritability of continuous 
variations was put to a crucial test by W. Johannsen. He 
studied a population of beans and found that it was made 
up of a number of races which differed from each other in 
the average size of their seeds and in other characters. 
The descendants of one plant gave seeds of small size, 
varying, it is true, from small to medium, yet maintaining 
for generation after generation an average size consider: 
ably lower than that of the population. The variations 
within this race were not inherited at all; the smallest and 
largest seeds, if only they had the same ancestry, gave 
progeny of the same average size. The descendants of 
other plants taken from the mixed population had larger 
seeds and the difference between the races persisted for as 
many generations as they were studied. By selecting large 
and small individuals from the mixed population it was 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  MUTATIONS 161 
possible to isolate large or small races, but after the race 
was once isolated a selection of variations occurring within 
it did not lead to any change in the average size of the 
race. 
Since the publication of this result the experiments of 
Jennings, De Vries, Pearl, Shull, Woltereck, and many 
others have confirmed it and extended it to many other 
classes of organisms. The results of this experimental 
work dealing with the constancy of heritable characters 
and the effects of selection of slight differences in these 
characters prove conclusively that the vast majority of the 
variations of organisms are not inherited. Just what is the 
cause of all such variations is not yet certain, but it is 
probable that all are the responses of the organism to 
changes in its environment and that these changes affect 
only the body of the individual and not the germ cells. 
Fig. 35 (8) indicates this condition. The body of the or- 
ganism is changed as an effect of environmental action, but 
its germ cells (represented in lighter color in the abdomen 
of the diagrammatic moth) and hence the characters of the 
progeny remain unchanged. 
Discrete variation or mutations.—We have considered 
the lack of influence of continuous variations (fluctuating 
variations of Darwin) upon heredity. Darwin himself, as 
has already been noted, had observed another type of varia- 
tion which he failed to consider because he believed that its 
occurrence was too rare to influence the course of evolution. 
He ealled such variations ‘‘ sports ’’ or monsters. The first 
investigator to lay great stress upon the importance of dis- 
continuous variation of this type was De Vries, influenced 
by his work on the evening primrose (@nothera lamarcki- 
ana). For over twenty years he bred this plant under con- 
ditions of scientific accuracy. His first culture gave a 
wholly new sport or mutation and in the continued culti- 
vation of the plant many other mutants were obtained, some

true, ie., retain their individuality in later generations 
when hybridized or inbred. De Vries obtained similar re- 
sults with other plants and assumed that such discontinu- 
ous mutations furnish the differences which make the basis 
for evolution. 
The rediscovery of Mendel’s laws of segregation and 
heredity have made possible a different interpretation of 
much of De Vries’ material. In the light of these dis- 
coveries it has been shown that his original strain of 
O. lamarckiana was a poly-hybrid, and that most of the 
mutants from it, if not all, were, in reality, but the reap- 
pearance of combinations of characters already present, 
although hidden, in the original stock. But although the 
greater part of the original mutations do not seem to have 
produced anything new in the race, the impetus given to 
the study of mutations by De Vries’ work has led to the 
discovery of other ‘‘ sports ’’ which seem really to have 
produced something new. The number of such mutations 
so far discovered in laboratory experiments which may be 
truly said to add something not present in the parent stock, 
ie., to be progressive, is small. Many recorded mutants 
seem rather to be due to the loss of some character. Thus 
albinism, which has appeared more than once in a pure 
strain, is due apparently, not to the addition of any factor 
which will cause albinism, but rather to the loss of what- 
ever substances in the germ cells cause the production of 
pigment. In some cases progressive changes have ap- 
peared. Many such are recorded as occurring suddenly 
among wild organisms, but the true nature of these is 
usually uncertain. Several mutations have been experi- 
mentally produced by Standfuss, Fischer, Tower, Morgan, 
and McDougall. Tower subjected various species of the 
potato beetle at the time of the ripening of the germ cells 
to extremes of temperature and moisture. The result was 
the formation of many new types of beetles, differing most 
conspicuously in pigmentation. These new beetles showed 
no tendency to revert to the parent form but bred true for 
generation after generation. Thus races having lighter 
color, darker color, differences in the arrangement of the  
-P-A-G-E-178
    164 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
markings on the wing covers, ete., were produced, races 
which were in all respects ‘‘ good ’’ species. Furthermore, 
it is asserted that these races differed in their instinctive 
equipment. Some, e.g., were far more rapacious than 
others. 
Frequency of mutations.—Thus the sudden appearance 
of new, discontinuous, and heritable diversities in organisms 
may be looked upon as established. But there is little 
agreement as to the extent and frequency of such muta- 
tions. There seems to be a growing tendency among biolo- 
gists to hold that they may be, in many cases, of very 
slight extent and of very great number, so as to form what 
is almost a continuous series. Davenport brings out this 
point of view clearly in the following: 
“Sometimes a prominent character is represented by a single 
determiner like (perhaps) roseness of the comb of the fowl; but in 
most cases there is a multiplicity of factors, as in human hair and 
skin pigments, in the yellow of mice, in shank feathering of fowls, 
and in seed coats of oats. In consequence of the fact of this multi- 
plicity of factors and of the fact that a variable number may be 
present in different cases, the adult character appears in numerous 
grades of development. 
Indeed, the gradation of characters is, in these cases, such that 
one has to recognize that discontinuous variation passes over into 
continuous variation, in the sense that 40, 41, 42 form a continuous 
series, if not in the sense that X, X+dX, X+ 2dX, ete, do. If a 
desire for uniformity leads us to conclude that all variations in the 
germ-plasm are discontinuous, at least we see in many of these 
variations sufficient justification for the continuity hypothesis of the 
old-fashioned selectionist.” 
Cause of mutation.—When we come to ask the cause 
of mutation we find very little certain evidence. Various 
theories have been advanced and must be considered in 
some detail. A possibility which has received great em- 
phasis in the past, chiefly in the works of Weismann, is to 
be found in the union of diverse elements in the two germ 
cells at the time of fertilization. We have seen that such 
union does sometimes produce new forms by combination 
of Mendelian unit characters, as in the production of the 
walnut comb of the fowl. But in such cases the new 
character does not seem to be permanent, but breaks up in 
later generations into its component parts. Whether new
-P-A-G-E-179
  CAUSE OF MUTATIONS 165 
and fixed forms may be produced in this way is not yet 
decided. The results of Morgan upon linkage of characters 
suggest that this is quite possible if a rearrangement of the 
constituents of the chromosomes takes place in such a way 
that characters which originally segregated freely can no 
longer do so. The greater amount of evidence points to the 
direct action of the environment upon the germ cells as the 
cause of mutation. McDougall injected various chemicals 
into the immature ovaries of @unothera biennis with the 
result that new heritable forms were produced. Similar 
results were obtained with other plants. Standfuss and 
Fischer have produced new forms of the butterflies 
Vanessa and Arctia by subjecting the pupe to low tem- 
peratures, and similar results have been obtained with other 
lepidopterous insects. Tower, as we saw on p. 163, has ob- 
tained mutations by subjecting the pupe of the potato 
beetle (Leptinotarsa) to abnormal conditions of tempera- 
ture and moisture during the period when the germ cells 
are ripening. This type of evidence, of which a consider- 
able amount has been collected, goes far towards proving 
the dependence of mutations upon changes in the germ cells 
caused by direct environmental action. Whether or not 
this is the only cause of progressive mutation cannot be de- 
cided from the evidence at hand. Whatever be the cause, 
it is certain that many differences in organisms do arise 
suddenly as ‘‘ sports ”’ and are transmitted unchanged to 
the descendants of the individuals first showing them. 
Mutations not swamped by cross-breeding.—In so far as 
the transmission of the new characters produced by muta- 
tion has been studied it appears to follow the laws of Men- 
delian heredity (p. 154). The new characters retain their 
individuality and are not swamped by cross-breeding with 
the race from which the mutant sprang. This fact is of 
extreme importance for evolution, since new characters 
produced by mutation are thus fixed immediately and give 
rise to new races which are in no danger of being swamped 
by interbreeding with the great mass of the population. 
Frequent repetition of the same mutation.—Another 
fact of importance is that when a group of organisms has
-P-A-G-E-180
166 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
once produced a mutation, the probability is that the same 
mutation will occur again and again. De Vries was the 
first to point out this condition. He obtained the same 
mutant many times from his cultures of Gnothera. The 
same condition has been observed in other organisms. 
This interesting fact may be explained either upon the 
assumption that the environmental action was the same 
in the various cases, or that some factor within the plant 
determined the form of the mutation, without regard to the 
nature of the environmental stimulus. The latter seems 
to be the true one. MacDougall obtained the same type of 
mutants from plants whose ovaries had been injected with 
different chemicals and treated with radium. He also ob- 
tained different mutants from different plants injected 
with the same chemical. 
Such results suggest that the type of the mutation is 
determined by something already present in the organism 
and that the unusual conditions in the environment serve to 
start the change. The abnormal environment sets off the 
mutation, but it appears that the character of the latter is 
determined by the nature of the organism in which it 
occurs. This fact leads to another important conclusion, 
that there is no adaptive relation between the mutation 
and the environment. So far as can be determined from 
the evidence at hand, the application of excessive heat 
to growing rats might, conceivably, produce either extra 
toes or sparse hair in the next generation. 
The Darwinian conception of natural selection—The 
fact last brought out, viz., that mutations need-not be 
adaptive and often have no conceivable relationship to the 
demands made by the environment upon the animal, leads 
to a consideration of the influence of selection upon muta- 
tions. On the Darwinian hypothesis natural selection is 
looked upon as an actual causative agent. As has been 
brought out, he supposed that, given fluctuating varia- 
tions, natural selection would shape the direction of evolu- 
tion in such a way that, given time, the organism would 
become perfectly adapted to its habitat. On such an hy- 
pothesis every instinctive act observable in an organism
-P-A-G-E-181
DARWIN’S CONCEPTION OF SELECTION 167 
must be looked upon as having adaptive value. Two quo- 
tations from Darwin seem clearly to bring this out. 
“But the mere existence of individual variability and of some well- 
marked varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, 
helps us but little in understanding how species arise in nature. 
How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organism 
to another part, and to the conditions of life and of one organic 
being to another being, been perfected? We see these beautiful 
co-adaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and in the mistletoe; 
and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings 
to the hairs of the quadruped or the feathers of the bird; in the 
structure of the beetle which dives through the water; in the plumed 
seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful 
adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world.” 
“Again it may be asked how is it that varieties which I call 
incipient species become ultimately converted into good and distinct 
species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far 
more than do the varieties of the same species? How do those groups 
of species which constitute what are called distinct genera and 
which differ from each other more than do species of the same 
genus, arise? All these results . . . follow from the struggle for 
life. Owing to this struggle, variations, however slight and from 
whatever cause proceeding, if they be in any degree profitable to 
the individuals of a species in their infinitely complex relations to 
other organic beings and to their physical conditions of life, will tend 
to the preservation of such individuals and will generally be in- 
herited by the offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better 
chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species 
which are periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have 
called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is 
preserved, by the term natural selection, in order to mark its relation 
to man’s power of selection.” 
Changes in the concept of natural selection.—With the 
discovery, on the one hand, that Darwinian fluctuations 
are not inherited, and, on the other, that new characters 
appear suddenly, due. possibly to the direct action of 
the environment upon the germ cells, there has come_ 
about necessarily a marked change in our conception of the 
function of natural selection. In the first place, the muta- 
tion hypothesis has relieved the investigator of the burden 
of attempting to find adaptive value in the various activ- 
ities of animals, and has allowed him to examine such 
behavior without preconceived notions. It is now admitted 
that adaptation, the fitness of the organism for the condi- 
tions of its life, is by no means so perfect as has been sup- 
   
-P-A-G-E-182
168 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
posed: more and more characters, studied in natural sur- 
roundings, are found to be quite indifferent, to offer’ no 
discoverable advantage or disadvantage to the organism 
possessing them. What does it matter whether the snail’s 
shell be twisted to the right or to the left; whether the 
pigment of the elytra of the beetle be arranged in continu- 
ous or broken lines; whether the young noddy is gray or 
white? The answer of the extreme selectionist has al- 
ways been: ‘‘ I do not know the value of the character, 
but it must have some worth. Otherwise it could not 
exist.’’ But the discovery that in a species of butterflies 
two distinct types of females, widely different in color, 
may live side by side, each breeding true in Mendelian 
ratios, quickly raises the question whether the coloration 
of these insects has any protective or selective value. Such 
cases of seemingly indifferent characters might be multi- 
plied indefinitely. On p. 113 are cited certain specific ex- 
amples of non-adaptive types of activity. Parker has re- 
cently argued in similar vein and has extended the con- 
ception of indifferent characters to the whole range of ani- 
mal reactions. He says: 
“Tt is my opinion, at least, that many animal reactions which we 
have been accustomed to call adaptations should not be thus desig- 
nated, and that the difficulties that we often meet in attempting to 
account for such reactions are due to our consideration of them 
from the standpoint of adaptations when in reality they are far 
from being such.” 
“The majority of animal reactions are, in all probability, neither 
conspicuously advantageous nor disadvantageous to the life of the 
individual.’ They are dependent chiefly upon the material composition 
of the given organism, and, so long as they are relatively indifferent 
to the continuance of life, they pass without special consequence.” 
Effect of natural selection upon mutations.—To accept 
the mutation hypothesis as at least one of the ways in 
which diversified structure arises, does not necessitate 
throwing overboard the concept of natural selection. A 
moment’s consideration shows that many animals and 
plants do thrive in the environment in which they are 
found, ie., that they are adapted to meet environmental 
demands: furthermore, that there is often an almost
-P-A-G-E-183
  EFFECT OF SELECTION ON MUTATION 169 
perfect correlation in the functioning of the different parts 
of the animal. The growing conception is that while natu- 
ral selection has no part in shaping such adaptations and 
such correlations, it nevertheless still retains the function 
of killing off those organisms unfitted to live in the environ- 
ment in which they are placed. A simpler way now to 
express what is meant is to avoid the use of the term 
selection and to state specifically what probably happens to 
new races. It is clear, in the first place, that a mutant when 
it is thrown off, must bring with it organs of reproduction. 
Furthermore, it must possess certain instinctive modes of 
procuring food and a mechanism for the digestion of food 
and for the excretion of waste products. Depending also 
upon the environment where it first appears it must bear 
essential mechanisms of attack and defense or else of flight. 
If the mutant falls by chance where, with its equipment, it 
ean live and reproduce its kind, it thrives. On the other 
hand, if this same mutant comes into existence in a locality 
where its equipment is not adequate, it perishes. If these 
simple (or complex) structural and functional demands 
are satisfied, the animal may possess—and often does pos- 
sess—a host of structural and functional characteristics 
which have no necessary role in its daily life (this is incon- 
ceivable on the Darwinian concept of evolution). Un- 
questionably the reason there are so many ‘‘ adaptive in- 
stincts ’’ on record and so few ‘‘ unadaptive ”’ ones is due 
to the fact that the naturalist has generally found what 
he sought. 
Ability to form habits enables the animal to supple- 
ment a faulty inheritance——When we examine the higher 
vertebrates, especially the mammals, shortly after birth, we 
find, as was brought out in the preceding chapter, that they 
are not born adapted, and furthermore, that when their 
instincts do appear they are oftentimes by no means per- 
fect in their action. It is here that habit reveals itself 
as being a positive factor in evolution. On the basis of 
what we now know to be true of habits, it seems possible 
to modify the demands we made above upon a mutant (if 
it is to survive) by saying that it either must appear
-P-A-G-E-184
170 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
  adapted to the environment, or else it must appear with 
sufficient plasticity to enable it readily to form habits. 
This appears most clearly in the work of Breed, already 
cited. The chick is born with the pecking instinct suffi- 
ciently developed to keep the organism alive. Adaptation 
becomes perfect through habit. 
Some special forms of asserted adaptations.—Through- 
out the literature of the Darwinist one finds voluminous 
reference to (a) protective resemblance; (b) warning 
coloration; and (c) sexual dimorphism. It is claimed by 
them that these phenomena may be explained by natural 
selection. Since such phenomena, however produced, are 
of especial interest to the students of behavior in view of 
the fact that the sense organs of animals are involved in 
their discussion, it seems worth while to consider them 
for a moment (although they offer no great difficulty, so 
far as explanation goes, on the hypothesis of mutation and 
selection already considered). 
(a) Protective resemblance-——We have touched upon the 
facts included under this heading on p. 124. Protective 
resemblance includes all the structural modifications of 
animals which tend to make them less conspicuous to their 
enemies or to make them resemble other animals which 
are not preyed upon by those enemies (mimicry). Many 
animals seem to resemble in color or pattern the back- 
grounds against which they normally live. Some slight 
evidence has been collected showing that mimicry is ‘‘ pro- 
tective.’? E. B. Poulton and C. B. Saunders noted the 
survivals among a large number of the pup of the butter- 
fly (Vanessa urtica) in different localities and found that 
those placed most conspicuously for the human eye were 
most readily found and devoured by birds. Cesnola 
fastened green and brown Mantis to plants of similar and 
contrasting color with the result that birds found the con- 
spicuously placed ones, the ones upon plants of contrast- 
ing color, most readily. (It might be noted here that vision 
in birds seems closely comparable with that of man, in so far 
as it has been tested, and hence the field studies are sup- 
ported by those of the laboratory.) Pearl has shown that 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  WARNING COLORATION 171 
while self-colored chickens (those which are of a uniform 
color all over the body) are more conspicuous for man than 
are barred or speckled birds, there is no larger percentage 
of the former killed by natural enemies than of the latter. 
Inconspicuousness for man does not, in this case, guarantee 
protection from other enemies. Doubt has been raised as 
to the reality of many of the more perfect cases of pro- 
tective coloration, and only careful field studies can estab- 
lish the adaptive character of the doubtful cases. 
(b) Warning coloration.—The theory of warning colora- 
tion supposes that brilliant and conspicuous colors in ani- 
mals are associated with effective defensive weapons. Such 
conspicuous characters serve as ‘‘ danger ’”’ or ‘‘ warn- 
ing ’’ signals to protect animals so equipped from attack. 
The theory has little factual support. Przibram has col- 
lected a large amount of evidence to show that warningly 
colored insects and their mimics are eaten readily by many 
other animals, yet this evidence shows only that the pro- 
tection afforded by the defensive organs is not perfect, not 
that the insects are not at all protected by their conspicu- 
ousness. Reighard has shown conclusively that the bril- 
liantly colored coral reef fishes do not possess ‘‘ that com- 
bination of conspicuousness with unpleasant attributes 
necessary to the theory of warning coloration.’’ The ordi- 
nary gray snappers which frequent the docks around juxta- 
tropical ports feed greedily upon the gaudily colored coral 
reef fishes when opportunity is offered under experimental 
conditions. The delicate coral reef fishes escape annihila- 
tion because of the protection offered by the reefs and be- 
cause of their agility. 
(c) Sexual dimorphism.—To the theory of sexual selec- 
tion Darwin attached great importance. In its extreme 
form the theory supposes not only a highly developed sen- 
sory acuity upon the part of the selecting animal but it 
assumes that animals have also definite color, form, and size 
~ “ preferences,’’ ie., a highly developed esthetic sense. 
There is as yet no evidence that this is the case nor can 
such evidence be gathered until it has been proved that the 
animals in question have a sensory equipment sufficiently
-P-A-G-E-186
  172 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
delicate to form a basis for such a selection. The problem 
is still complicated, even when such anthropomorphic con- 
ceptions are ruled out. The phenomena which one seeks to 
explain by the theory of sexual selection are chiefly those 
of sexual dimorphism, differences in structure and behavior 
of the two sexes, although there are other characters which 
may be subject to the same selective agents. 
Many cases of sexual dimorphism do not demand any 
active selection by a member of one sex between two mem- 
bers of the opposite sex. The vigorous struggle between 
males for the possession of the females, mutual fitness for 
mating, the care of the young, all such activities would lead 
naturally to the production of sexual dimorphism by a se- 
lection which involved no sensory discrimination by mem- 
bers of either sex. In any given case of dimorphism it is 
extremely difficult to determine what part may have been 
played by this impersonal struggle and what part by a true 
preference for some earlier mutants. Certainly the truth 
or falseness of the theory can be demonstrated only by ex- 
perimental methods and as yet but little evidence has been 
obtained by their use. 
The experimental evidence of sexual selection—An- 
drews, Chidester, Holmes, and others have shown that smell 
and taste are the chief sensory agents in the mating of 
arthropods. Mayer experimented with a moth (Callosamia 
promethea), in which the males and females are different in 
color, in order to test the preferences and selective activities 
of the females. 
“Tn order to test this hypothesis I cut off the wings of a number 
of females, leaving only short stumps, from which all the scales were 
carefully brushed. Male wings were then neatly glued to the stumps, 
and thus the female presented the appearance of the male. Under 
these conditions the males mated with the females quite as readily 
as they would have done under normal conditions.” 
“T tried the experiment of gluing female wings unon the male. 
Here again the mating seemed to occur with normal frequency, and I 
was unable to detect that the females ‘displayed any unusual aversion 
towards their effeminate-looking consorts.” 5 
“Tt is also interesting to note that normal males pay no attention . 
to males with female wings.” 
“Tn another series of experiments the wings were cut entirely 
off the males and females and the scales brushed off their bodies; 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
EXPERIMENTS ON SELECTION 173 
and yet these shabby males were readily accepted by normal females, 
nor could I see that normal males displayed any aversion to mating 
with wingless females.” 
“We are therefore forced to conclude that the melanie coloration 
of the male has not been brought about through the agency of sexual 
selection on the part of the female.” 
More recently Mayer and Soule have repeated these ex- 
periments with another species and verified the results in 
all respects save one: wingless males were selected against 
by normal females but mated successfully with blind ones. 
Sturtevant has taken up the same question with the fruit-fly 
and has found that vigor is the chief factor in determining 
the matings. Since certain eye colors of Drosophila are 
associated with greater or less vigor, there results a quite 
definite selection of eye color, but such a selection could not 
be the determining agent in producing a sexual dimor- 
phism. From this and other less direct evidence Morgan is 
inclined to rule out sexual selection as a factor ‘in evolu- 
tion, ascribing sexual dimorphism rather to the persistence 
of indifferent mutations which have arisen in the sex 
chromosomes. In contradiction to this view a certain 
amount of evidence may be cited in favor of sexual selection, 
which, although not conclusive, still keeps the problem 
open. Sturtevant (reported by Morgan, 1913) removed 
the wings from male fruit-flies and offered females a choice 
between normal and wingless males. Neither was pre- 
ferred, mating with wingless and normal males occurring 
in equal numbers. But when the males were placed sepa- 
rately with the females the average interval before mating 
was for the normal males 18 minutes, for wingless males, 
40 minutes. This is interpreted as meaning that the female 
is more readily excited by the normal males. It was not 
a determining factor for selection of confined individuals, 
but it should be pointed out that among unconfined indi- 
viduals where courtship is subject to interruption the 
quicker excitement of the female by any male would lead 
to an effective selection of that male. In a recent paper 
--Davenport has stated that he finds a selection against 
~eertain brilliant colors in the cock, and evidence for color 
vision in the fowl at least offers a basis for such selection. 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  174 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
Moreover, the behavior of animals in experiments where 
attempts are made to hybridize certain species should not 
be overlooked. The zebra can with difficulty be induced 
to mate with the horse, while crosses between the zebra 
and ass are made without difficulty (Rommel). In a very 
suggestive paper Pearl has called attention to the fact that 
the jacks kept by mule breeders acquire reactions that are 
somewhat comparable to those called out by sexual symbols 
or fetishes in man. The problem of sexual selection has 
never been approached in a systematic manner and there is 
really no evidence at present upon which any general con- 
clusions may be based. Cases such as those cited above in- 
dicate that, in higher mammals at least, the problem may 
be seriously complicated by the habits of the animals, and 
accordingly that sexual selection is not a general or a racial 
problem, but one which more narrowly concerns the indi- 
vidual. 
III. Innerrrance or ACQUIRED CHARACTERS — 
Lamarck’s laws.—In a note on p. 161 we expressed the 
view that there is a growing body of evidence to show that 
certain types of somatic variations are heritable. We wish 
now briefly to consider this evidence. As the individual 
develops it becomes better fitted to its environment through 
the perfection of instinctive mechanisms and the formation 
of habits. Early in the history of evolution the possibility 
that such ontogenetically acquired adaptations might be 
transmitted to the offspring suggested itself. Lamarck 
gave the most thorough formulation to this view in his two 
well known laws: 
“ First law.—In every animal which has not reached the limits of 
development the frequent and sustained use of any organ strengthens 
that organ little by little, it develops, enlarges and assumes a 
strength proportional to the amount of use; on the contrary, the 
failure to use any organ constantly causes it to grow weaker, it 
deteriorates, loses its function and finally disappears. 
“ Second law.—All that nature has forced the individual to acquire 
or lose by the influence of circumstances to which its race has 
long been exposed, hence all that has been acquired or lost by the 
predominating use or disuse of any organ, has been preserved in later
-P-A-G-E-189
EXPERIMENTS ON SELECTION 175 
reproduction to later individuals by inheritance, provided that the 
modifications have been acquired by the two sexes in common or by 
those individuals which have given birth to the new race.” 
The followers of Lamarck carried this theory to still fur- 
ther extremes, assuming that all characters acquired by the 
individual as the result of the action of environment were 
inherited. Darwin accepted Lamarck’s view of the value 
of use and disuse in evolution, calling upon this principle 
whenever his own theory of natural selection seemed in- 
adequate to account for the facts observed. As soon as an 
attempt was made to verify the theory by experimental evi- 
dence, the strongest possible objection to it appeared—the 
theory did not seem to work—the tails might be cut from 
mice for many generations without reducing the size of the 
tails of the progeny ;(the strong arm of the blacksmith was 
not transmitted to his son. Then came Weismann’s theory 
of the continuity of the germ-plasm which showed the diffi- 
culties in the way of the transmission of bodily characters 
to the germ cells. Lamarek’s theory was practically 
dropped for many years. 
Recent experiments on the inheritance of acquired 
characters.—During the past few years the theory has 
been revived by several investigators who seemingly have 
obtained experimental evidence of the existence of the in- 
heritance of certain types of somatic variations. The method 
which has secured this evidence was first indicated by the 
experiments of Marie V. Chauvin upon the Mexican Axo- 
lotl. Under favorable conditions this salamander retains 
the aquatic habit throughout life, breathing with external 
gills and never forming functional lungs. Unfavorable 
conditions in nature will, however, lead to the loss of the 
gills, to the formation of functional lungs, and to the as- 
sumption of a terrestrial mode of life. In the laboratory 
the metamorphosis may be brought about by various means, 
such as the reduction of the oxygen in the water. The eggs 
of animals which had been forced in the laboratory to as- 
sume a terrestrial mode of life were deposited and hatched 
under normal conditions. The larve. were kept under con- 
ditions where the progeny of untreated parents had never
-P-A-G-E-190
  ; 176 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
been known to desert the water. But at the end of a year 
these larve showed a reduction in the size of the gills and, 
when offered an opportunity to go on land, went through 
the metamorphosis in a shorter time than had ever been ob- 
served among normal animals. From this it seems that the 
induced tendency to metamorphosis was inherited. Yet 
the experiments were too limited and too lacking in con- 
trols to do more than indicate the direction which further 
work should take. 
The same may be said of the work of Schroeder upon the 
willow-leaf beetle. The eggs of this insect are deposited 
and the larve fed upon the smooth leaves of a willow 
(Salix fragilis). Schroeder transferred the eggs and larve 
to a downy-leafed willow where the larve learned to push 
away the down with their heads before feeding upon the 
tissues of the leaves. After metamorphosis the adults were 
offered a choice between the smooth and the downy willows, 
and a small percentage deposited their eggs upon the downy 
leaves. This ‘‘ training ’’ of the larve was repeated for 
four generations with a gradual increase in the percentage 
of adults which chose the downy leaves until, in the fourth 
generation, all of the adults deposited their eggs upon 
the downy willow, avoiding the natural food plant. The 
results are open to the criticism that no adults fed on 
smooth-leafed willows were given a choice of the two 
plants as a control, and that the plants used differed greatly 
in size, so that no accurate judgment of the results to be 
expected from chance can be formed. 
The larva of the moth (Gracillaria stigmatella) eats the 
leaves of a willow, bending over and fastening the tips of 
the leaves on which it is feeding so as to form a sort of tent 
in which it lives. Schroeder cut off the tips of the leaves, 
whereupon the larve made their houses by bending over the 
edges of the mutilated leaves, adapting themselves to the 
new conditions. The next generation was again brought 
up upon leaves without tips,’and alt formed their tents by 
rolling in the edges of the leaves. The third generation was 
restored to normal conditions. Nineteen larvee were ob- 
tained. Fifteen of them rolled up the leaf tips, just as

the wild insects do, but 4 made their tents from the edges 
of the leaves. The final numbers are too small to be con- 
clusive, particularly so-since no accurate data respecting 
the occurrence of this habit in nature were obtained; but 
the experiment is suggestive of promising work in the 
same field. 
The experiments of Kammerer.—The same objections 
cannot be urged against the experiments of Kammerer, 
which are very extensive and, save for the remote possibility 
of faulty technique, seem to establish the inheritance of 
certain somatic adaptations. The experiments have been 
carried out in great detail upon several amphibia and rep- 
tiles and the results are far too extensive to be reviewed 
here. Certain observations upon the obstetrical toad 
(Alytes obstetricans) have, however, a‘direct bearing upon 
the origin of instincts and may be summarized briefly. The 
obstetrical toad is ordinarily exceptional in its mode of 
reproduction. It has acquired an almost exclusive land 
habit, going to water only at rare intervals to moisten the 
skin. Copulation takes place on land and the eggs, which 
are relatively few and large, are carried by the male, 
wrapped around his thighs. The embryos mature in their 
gelatinous capsules while attached to the male and escape 
only when he goes to the water. By subjecting the toads 
at the breeding season to high temperature in a terrarium 
provided with a water basin, the toads were forced to spend 
much of their time in the water and the eggs were deposited 
there. When the egg chains were laid in the water their 
gelatinous envelops would not adhere to the thighs of the 
male and consequently the eggs were left to develop in the 
water. After this was repeated during several breeding 
periods the toads acquired the ‘‘ habit ’’ of going to the 
water to lay their eggs, and this habit persisted when 
they were restored to normal conditions. The eggs laid at 
the different breeding periods during the formation of the 
aquatic habit were kept under normal! conditions of tempera- 
ture until they reached maturity and the behavior of this 
second generation of toads was noted. 
First brood,—The eggs which formed this brood were
-P-A-G-E-192
  178 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
laid when the parents were first driven to the water by 
heat and before they had gained the aquatic habit. The 
members of this brood all laid their eggs in the normal 
manner. 
Second brood.—The members of this brood, formed after 
the parents had begun to acquire the habit of laying in 
the water, were abnormal to a slight extent. At their first 
breeding period the eggs were laid upon the land but the 
males did not take them up. All later broods produced by 
members of this second brood were carried normally by 
the males. 
Third brood—tThis brood, like the second, laid their 
eggs upon land, but in their first and second broods the 
eggs were not taken up by the males. In their third brood 
the eggs were partly taken up, and in their fourth brood 
the behavior became normal. 
Fourth and later broods.—The eggs which formed this 
brood were laid after the habit of laying in the water had 
become thoroughly established in the parents. Their first 
brood was laid in the water, the second upon land, but 
without being taken up by the males. The third brood 
was normal. 
Some of the adults from these broods were subjected 
again to the high temperature and forced to breed re- 
peatedly in the water, and this was repeated for several 
generations. Many structural changes appeared and in- 
ereased from generation to generation. One of these was 
the appearance of a horny pad upon the thumb of the 
males of the fourth generation, a pad which closely re- 
sembled that found ordinarily upon the thumbs of frogs 
breeding normally in the water. In the third generation 
the pad appeared as a slight thickening of the skin, so its 
acquirement, like that of the instinct to lay the eggs in 
water, seemed to have been gradual. These experiments in- 
dicate an actual inheritance of adaptive somatic characters 
in which the degree of inheritance of the character is pro- 
portional to the length of time during which the parent was 
subject to the influence of the abnormal environment. A 
large number of other experiments by Kammerer upon
-P-A-G-E-193
EXPERIMENTS ON SELECTION 179. 
other characters in salamanders and reptiles have given 
similar results. 
Some evidence negative in character.—Experiments of 
this type, considered alone, are enough to convince one 
that acquired characters are inherited, but zodlogists are 
inclined to regard such results with more than usual sus- 
picion and this attitude is certainly justified by the mass 
of contradictory evidence. The evidence from selection has 
already been considered and is entirely negative. Many — 
attempts to get an inheritance of characters forced, as it 
were, upon the soma have all failed. Thus Bogdanow cut 
off the wings of the house-fly for ten generations without 
causing any change in the wings of the progeny, and Galton 
transfused the blood of differently colored rabbits without 
affecting the color of their descendants. The more weighty 
evidence comes, however, from transplantation experiments. 
Harrison was able to graft together parts of the larve of 
two species of frogs which later developed into a chimera 
with a head of one species and a body of the other, neither 
part being influenced by its close association with the 
other. The results of several investigators in transplanting 
ovaries from one variety of animals to another have been 
negative. In rabbits, fowls, and in ascidians the trans- 
plantations were without effect, the eggs were quite un- 
influenced by their new surroundings. In only one case is 
there definite evidence to the contrary. Kammerer has 
found a marked influence of the soma upon transplanted 
germ cells of the fire salamander. In this case transplanta- 
tion of the ovaries to ordinary individuals had no effect, 
but transplantation to a new race, which Kammerer holds 
to have been produced by the inheritance of acquired 
characters, gave positive results. 
The direct adaptation theory of evolution.—Although, 
as yet, the evidence in favor of the inheritance of acquired 
characters is inconclusive, it is of sufficient importance 
to make it impossible to disregard entirely the possibility 
that such inheritance has played a large réle in adaptive 
evolution. Various theories have been advanced to explain 
the mechanism by which characters might be impressed 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  180 CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS 
upon the race by the action of environment. Fig. 35 illus- 
trates the chief two divisions into which these theories 
fall. First the change may be brought about by the action 
of the environmental agent upon both the soma and the 
germ cell, the parallel induction theory, producing in each 
changes of the same nature. The experiment of Sitowski, 
although not showing a true inheritance of an acquired 
character, may serve to illustrate this point. He fed the 
larve of a moth with a dye (Sudan red III.) and found 
that the dye was carried over through ‘the eggs to the next 
generation of caterpillars. The dye affected both the body 
and germ cells of the larve, i.e., stained them, in the same 
way. However, the mass of evidence seems to be against 
this view, since it was shown earlier (p. 167) that the direct 
action of the environment upon the germ cell in those cases 
which have been studied carefully has the effect of causing 
variations which are not adaptive—not in line with the 
habits which are acquired during the life of the individual. 
The second possibility is that of indirect action of the 
environment through the soma (Fig. 35). The changes 
which take place in the body are supposed in some way to 
react upon the germ cells, inducing a corresponding change 
in them. Darwin’s theory of pangenesis is probably the 
most widely known of such theories, although it has been 
completely abandoned. He assumed that every cell in the 
body was constantly giving off minute replicas of itself 
which were carried in the blood and finally got into the 
germ cells, where they provided the material for the repro- 
duction of similar structures in the next generation. <A 
more recent view to account for the indirect effect of en- 
vironment upon the germ cells is known as the hormone 
theory. 
The hormone theory.—Cunningham, basing his argu- 
ment chiefly upon the observational and experimental evi- 
dence on the production of secondary sexual characters, has 
evolved a chemical theory to explain the. inheritance of 
acquired characters, known as the hormone theory. The 
connection between gonad (sexual cells) development and 
the formation of the secondary sex characters is now well
-P-A-G-E-195
  SUMMARY 181 
established. The hen, after ovariotomy, assumes the spurs 
and plumage of the male. The crab, castrated by the para- 
sites, Sacculina, assumes the proportions and many of the 
characteristics of the female. Cunningham supposes that 
such observations prove that the development of the sec- 
ondary sexual characters follows upon the production of 
some secretion of the reproductive cells or gonads. He 
then assumes that a reversal of the process is possible, i.e., 
that a developing structure, a callus, e.g., can produce a 
secretion or hormone, which, carried in the blood, may 
reach the reproductive cells and induce in them a change 
corresponding to the somatic change. Since Cunningham 
published the theory (1908), a considerable body of favor- 
able evidence has been collected. (As examples, see the 
works of Gudernatsch, Todd, Rérig.*) ‘ 
Summary.—Since, finally, the activities of organisms 
must be considered as the functioning of definite structural 
elements, the problem of the origin of new reflexes, of new 
instincts, and of new possibilities of habit formation become 
one with the problem of the evolution of morphological 
characters in general. -In_the instinct, as in the structural 
arrangements, two orders of phenomena are apparent— 
diversity and fitness. The diversity is accounted for by the 
interaction of developmental processes within the organism, 
and environmental factors. Most of the variations in the 
individual are quite undirected and without adaptive rela- 
tion to the agents producing them, but some, like the new 
characters acquired in habit formation, are made adaptive 
by a process of learning in the individual. The inheritance 
of such adaptive characters, if demonstrated, would form 
a ready method of evolution which would account for all 
diversity and fitness; but as yet the inheritance of somatic 
adaptation is not established. The only new characters 
whose heritability has been demonstrated are mutations, and 
these are never directly adaptive. The problem as to why

plain the inheritance of acquired characters can scarcely be inter- 
preted in terms of a physiological mechanism and is of little help 
in the envisagement of our problems.

they seem to be adaptive is answered—how completely it is 
as yet uncertain—by assuming that natural selection elimi- 
nates individuals (mutants) which are not endowed with 
characters enabling it to exist in the locality in which it 
first appears. The application of either the selection or the 
direct adaptation theory to behavior complexes is as yet 
impossible, owing to the lack of any very definite concepts 
of the structural basis of behavior.

I. Content of the term habit.—In Chapter IV it was 
shown that instinct is analyzable into simple congenital re- 
flexes. It was suggested there that-habit also might, so far 
as analysis goes, be found to consist of congenital reflexes. 
Experimental studies upon habit formation lend support to 
this view. Instinct and habit differ so far as concerns the 
origin of the pattern (number and localization of simple 
reflex ares involved) and the order (temporal relations) of 
the unfolding of the elements composing that pattern. (In 
instinct both pattern and order are inherited: in habit 
both are acquired) We do not hesitate to define habit as 
we do instinct—as a complex system of reflexes which 
184
-P-A-G-E-199
  
CONTENT OF TERM HABIT 185 
function in a serial order when the organism is confronted 
by certain stimuli, provided we add the clause which marks 
off habit from instinct, viz., that in habit the order and 
pattern are acquired during the life of the individual ani- 
mal. After habits are perfected they function in all par- 
ticulars as do instincts. No mere examination of adult 
animals will enable us to differentiate between the respec- 
tive rdles of habit and instinct, since the one observable 
difference between the two types of acts is that of origin. 
Since habits are thus seen to be individual acquisitions of 
particular animals, it is necessary to describe the process by 
means of which certain reflexes are selected out from 
among a very large number of possible reflexes. Such a 
description of the factors involved in selection can be more 
adequately presented after we have looked more carefully 
into some of the general features of habit. Accordingly 
we shall take up the process_of selection in the following 
chapter.1 It may be inferred from the above statements 
1 We must emphasize the fact that all organized responses which 
can be called forth from both man and animal fall under the one 
or the other of these heads, instincts (including here the simplest 
form of reflexes), and habits. In Chapter I we tried to show that 
what are called “images” (and the thought processes generally) 
are really nothing more than the implicit habits which are formed 
principally in the laryngeal muscles, and we would further state 
now that those functions which we have hitherto called “ affective ” 
really belong in the realm of instincts. It will be remembered that 
James made the following distinction between the motor processes 
of emotions and those of instincts: those underlying emotions con- 
sist of bodily reverberations, movements of breathing, circulation, 
glands, ete., the loci of which are confined to the subject’s own body; 
whereas those underlying instincts consist largely of movements of 
the striated muscles. As we understand James he seemingly would 
make emotions objects of introspection, whereas instincts are the 
legitimate prey of the behaviorist. Since we do not admit any 
such distinction, it follows that from our point of view both emo- 
tions and instincts belong in one and the same class. I€ follows 
further that the so-called affective processes must be grouped under 
what has hitherto been called emotions, and hence under our gen- 
eral class of instinctive modes of response. Behavior regards all 
three groups from the same point of view. A given stimulus may, 
through inherited systems of reflexes, produce a response of a cer- 
tain kind in the striped musculature which we may name flight. 
On the other hand a stimulus may produce its effect largely through 
the sympathetic system (dilation of vessels in the face, etc.) which 
psychology would call embarrassment, finally (as a special form of
-P-A-G-E-200
  186 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
that the organism is dependent upon heredity for unit acts. 
The number of these apparently can never be increased or 
decreased, but large numbers of them can be shaped 
so as to form different types of habit, depending upon 
the kind of environment into which the organism is 
thrown. The organism is so constructed that when certain 
stimuli are presented certain types of random movements 
are set free. Individuals certainly differ enormously in 
the number and kinds of random activity which they may 
display upon the presentation of given stimuli2 If ap- 
propriate random acts do not appear upon the incidence of 
the given stimulus, it is fruitless to attempt to establish 
habits respecting that stimulus, e.g., if the child fails to 
respond adequately to colors, pencils, chalk, and to the 
form and size of objects (when intensity and combination 
are sufficiently varied) it is useless to try to instil artistic 
habits. On the other hand, this-same child may show a 
rich display of random activity, suitable to the formation 
of habit, when presented with the objects belonging to 
what are called the mechanical arts or trades; habits under 
such conditions are formed quickly and readily. It seems 
safe to conclude that all of the vocations are probably at 
bottom dependent upon particular hereditary types of or- 
ganization, i.e., dependent upon the presence of ran- 
dom activity of proper kinds. The same thing appears in 
the case of the animals. It has long been recognized that in 
order to get the animal to form habits one must set problems. 
for him which will call only for the random type of activity 
of which he is capable. One does not usually set the same 
type of problem for a bird that one sets for a monkey. We 
scrutinize pretty carefully in the young animal the reper- 
emotion) another stimulus, through inherited or acquired connec- 
tions, may produce an effect of one or another kind upon the 
errogenous zones, which psychology would class as the one or the 
other affective element (process?). 
? It would be interesting to test habit formation under conditions 
such that instead of increasing the stimulating value of an object 
(complex stimuli) we should heighten the state of irritability of 
the organism by the administration of strychnine, etc. The effect 
of drugs on behavior can be more easily attacked in the animal than 
in the human world, .
-P-A-G-E-201
  RESTATEMENT 187 
toire of random activity, and so shape the problems that 
their solution calls for no unit acts not in his repertoire. 
Restatement.—What we emphasize in brief may be 
stated agains when an animal is presented with a stimulus 
which calls forth random movements (e.g., food inside of a 
problem box), the reflex repertoire is set free. Now in 
this repertoire is a combination of reflexes which will en- 
able the animal to get food. In some way (by a purely 
mechanical process, to be later described) this combination 
gets selected and in time comes to be the only system 
which responds when that particular object is presented to 
the animal. It should be clear from our description that 
to use the term ‘‘ habit ’’ to cover all observable adjust- 
ment in animals is most confusing. The literature is full 
of such titles as the ‘‘ habits and natural history ’’ of a 
given species. Such titles cover both the instincts and the 
habits of the animals under consideration, and no effort is 
made to separate the two forms of adjustment. A still 
more violent strain upon the meaning which the term 
habit should connote comes from experimental zodlogy. 
-They speak there of the habits of growth of certain tissues. 
In such cases it is preferable to speak of temporally spaced 
systems of growth, or to adopt some wholly new phrase. 
The term habit should be confined strictly to new forms 
of adjustment acquired during the lifetime of the indi- 
vidual animal.’ 
II. Types of habit.—The human experimenter in the 
laboratory forces certain types of habit upon particular 
animals. Where the object is to bring into relief the va- 
rious action systems, he forces the animals to form what 
are called motor_habits. In studying them the experimenter 
may be primarily interested in the rapidity of the forma- 
tion of such habits; the stages in their formation, such as 
the initial accuracy of the first performance, when con- 
sidered from the standpoint of the amount of excess time 
and .excess effort; the rate of elimination of these excess 
*Tt is just possible that owing to the growing body of evidence 
that certain habits are transmitted by parent to offspring, we shall 
have to speak of ontogenetic habits and phylogenetic habits. 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  
188 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
factors in early stages and in later stages; the number and 
complexity of the habits which may be formed; whether 
such habit systems mutually influence one another as 
regards reénforcement or the reverse. He may wish to 
consider, after having determined the normal course of the 
formation of a habit, ways in which the so-called normal 
process may be altered, e.g., the effect of ‘‘ putting the 
animal through ”’ the act, allowing the trained animals to - 
perform within the sensory range of the untrained ani- 
mals, ete. We shall reserve the discussion of these latter 
factors until Chapter VIII is reached. 
Examination of the work which has been done on motor 
habits shows that such habits fall usually under two sub- 
heads: (1) motor habits in the narrow sense, e.g., as those 
formed in the maze and in box I; and (2) habits of manipu- 
lation, e.g., the opening of latches, the pulling of strings, 
turning buttons, ‘pulling out plugs, ete. Such acts may be 
very simple or, through combination, very complex. In 
the discussion which foliows we use the term motor habit in 
its restricted sense. 
In contrast to the motor stand the sensory habits (called 
by Yerkes discrimination habits). Here emphasis is laid 
upon the functioning of the receptor (or upon defining 
the stimulus to which response is. made, p. 61) rather 
than upon that of the muscle. The act which the animal 
has to perform may be already in its repertoire, e.g., he 
may have only to walk to the right or to the left, depending 
on which side the stimulus is administered. The experi- 
menter’s object is to bring out the whole range of stimuli 
to which the animal can respond, the amount of stimula- 
tion necessary for response, ete. His criterion, however, 
as to whether the stimulus lies within the sensory range of 
the animal is afforded by the fact that a definite habit can 
be formed, viz., that of reacting positively or negatively to 
the stimulus. The results presented in the chapters on 
sensory responses have been largely obtained by forcing 
the formation of such habits. On p. 220 we shall undertake 
the analysis of a group of sensory habits (thé response of 
rodents to monochromatic lights).
-P-A-G-E-203
  TYPES OF HABIT 189 
A third type of habit of very great interest has been 
studied at the University of Chicago, mainly under the 
influence of H. A. Carr. This type of habit, called the 
delayed response,‘ falls under neither of the above heads, 
yet it seems to involve very complex motor processes as 
well as sensory. The essential object in establishing the 
delayed reaction is (1) to see within what limits reaction 
to a given stimulus may be delayed. In a rough way we 
might illustrate the type of delayed reaction by citing 
those cases of hunting animals which prey upon smaller 
species living in holes or coverts. The hunter is stimulated 
visually only momentarily by his prey; nevertheless, he 
goes to the place into which it has vanished. He is react- 
ing during the final stages of the response just as though 
the specific visual stimulus were present.° This response 
has been brought under laboratory control by training the 
animal to go for food to a light which may appear in any. 
one of three boxes, left, in front, or to the right (for ap- 
paratus see p. 105). After training, the light is turned on 
in any one of the boxes. While the light is on the animal 
is stimulated by it but he is restrained from reacting to it. 
The light is then turned off. The experimenter waits for a 
definite interval and then releases the animal. The correct 
response on the animal’s part calls for a positive movement 
towards the box in which the light has appeared. (2) 
Another object of the experimenter is to determine the 
factors by means of which correct response is attained (i.e., 
the behavior during the period of delay, maintenance of 
bodily attitude, ete.) .

possible to consider this form of response under the heading of

ever, it seems more appropriate to treat it under the general head 
of habit. 
* Those familiar with the work on the lower organisms will 
recognize at once the fact that in this type of habit one meets the 
old question in somewhat different form as to whether the stimulus 
to orientation must exert its directive influence constantly as is 
assumed by Loeb for the tropism, or discretely and momentarily as 
is maintained by Jennings and Mast.

formation of a motor habit by allowing the white rat to 
obtain food from a simple problem box, such as that shown 
in box I on p. 94. We have reason to believe, through our 
knowledge of the rat’s motor organization, before we start, 
that the acts by means of which he will get the food all lie 
within his repertoire. After sawdust has been banked 
around the box for a height of 2 or 3 inches the food is 
placed inside. Since there is no instinctive mechanism 
which will immediately enable the animal to get the food, 
several separate reflexes must be chained together. These, 
when perfectly concatenated, will function just as surely 
and just as perfectly as an instinct. This fact must be 
emphasized—the physiological condition of the animal is 
such (state of hunger) that food stimuli (it will be seen 
that we cannot tell what receptors are involved, smell, sight, 
ete., except by experimental analysis) will release the 
native reflexes. In this case they are, in brief, as follows: 
Running rapidly and walking slowly from place to place; 
sniffing, sneezing, washing the face or body; touching 
constantly the sides of the restraining cage and the box 
with vibrisse or the bare snout, feet, etc.; clinging to all 
of the objects, sometimes with head up and sometimes with 
head down; crawling on the ceiling of the restraining cage; 
butting the nose into the crevices of the wire; gnawing ‘at 
the wire and at all of the wooden parts; pushing with 
great force against the box; stopping every few minutes to 
clean the paws of bits of sawdust; sitting up on haunches 
and chewing these bits; scratching at the sawdust with a 
group of characteristic movements which not only produce 
a hole but throw out the sawdust as well (this of course 
when the animal has had no experience with the sawdust) ; 
«squeezing through holes so made; moving vibrissee and nose 
across the bottom of the cage; mounting up through the 
hole; seizing the food; dragging it out to the nest, in case 
the latter is allowed, ete. This list is not by any means 
complete. These movements are repeated over and over 
again with ever varying order. Finally, however, the 
order is such that the food is obtained. The animal walks 
to a definite place, scratches and pushes out the sawdust
-P-A-G-E-205
  
  MOTOR HABITS IN BIRDS 191 
to make a hole sufficiently large to squeeze through, enters 
and reaches the food. The total time of success will vary 
(7.04 min.—17.65 min.). On the second trial, which may 
be given immediately after the first (but the time of suc- 
cess of the second trial will vary with the method) we find, 
as a rule, an enormous decrease in the number of reflexes. 
The activity is more confined, i.e., the area covered by the 
animal is less and what area is covered is covered less 
intensively (time, 1.69 min.—7.20 min.). On the third 
trial the time is still further decreased (.48 min.). At 
the fourteenth trial the time is reduced to .11 min. 
Motor habits: birds.—A similar motor habit in birds 
follows: When a wire box with a suitable door 
has been inverted over the nest of a sooty tern and 
left there until the bird has become completely accustomed 
to it, and the opening is then banked up with sand, we 
observe somewhat similar movements to those just de- 
scribed in the case of the rat. On the first test the bird 
alighted from the air near the nest. It did not seem 
frightened by the change in conditions. It walked imme- 
diately to the nest, but finding the sand, walked around 
and around the box trying to force its way in through the 
meshes of the wire. It tried to get into the door again, but 
would not scratch at the sand. It divided its time between 
the east side of the box where the eggs could be plainly 
seen, and the west side where it had formerly gained ad- 
mission. The types of movement displayed were, on the 
whole, rather simple: they consisted mainly of walking; 
pushing the beak through the meshes of the wire, striking 
the wings against the cage, flying away for a short dis- 
tance and then coming back to the old alighting place, 
only to repeat the endless movements just described. It 
is rather interesting to note that the bird did not use the 
scratching reflex, although this particular species digs a 
hole in the sand in which to deposit its eggs. This reflex 
seems to be tied up with a very definite period of the nesting 
eycle, viz., such holes are dug only before the egg is laid. 
Nevertheless it is possible to exaggerate the inflexibility 
of this reflex, since even the young birds will dig holes in 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
192 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
the sand in hot weather (p. 136). Thinking that the egg 
might be destroyed, the experimenter scraped away the 
sand covering the entrance so as to expose an inch of the 
opening. The bird alighted, passing by the door again and 
again. Two inches of the opening were then exposed. 
Under these circumstances the bird mounted the sand pile 
again and again and attempted to push its way through 
the meshes of the wire above the opening. Finally by 
  accident it poked its head through the opening and ~ 
squeezed the rest of the body through, making no effort to 
scratch. The time required for this whole trial was 1 hour. 
After allowing the bird 5 minutes on the nest it was driven 
away, and the sand piled up against the door to the height 
at which it had previously been successful. Most of the 
useless movements disappeared. The time required was 
only 1.16 minutes. On the third trial the sand was piled 
so as to completely cover the entrance. After 20 minutes 
of random movements with no success an inch of the open- 
ing was exposed. The bird came up and squeezed through 
the hole, making violent efforts, in 0.25 minute. On the 
following day no further tests were made, since the mate 
of this bird was on the nest. On the second day afterwards 
the sand was piled up to within 1 inch of the top of the 
door. The time for entrance was 2 minutes. On the next 
trial, once again the sand was piled so as to completely 
cover the entrance. After 38 minutes of random move- 
ments, while attempting to poke its head through the wire 
meshes above the opening, it accidentally poked its bill 
and head through the sand pile, withdrew the head, walked 
around and around the cage, as it came back to the hole 
poking its head into it 6 or 8 times. Success was attained 
* at the end of 40 minutes from the beginning of the test. 
On the next test this animal required 7 minutes to effect 
this response. On succeeding tests it dived at once for the 
opening, made a small hole, pulled the head out, ran half 
way round the box, returned and squeezed through the 
opening. Time, 0.66 minute. 
Motor habits: fish.—Thorndike has described in very 
general terms the labyrinth habit of a fish (Fundulus). His
-P-A-G-E-207
  MOTOR HABITS IN FISH 193 
plan was to confine the animal in the sunlight in a tank by 
means of glass partitions which had holes in them placed 
at different distances from the ends, thus converting the 
tank as a whole into a simple labyrinth. The animal first, 
e.g., has to swim up and to the left to cross the first parti- 
tion; up and near the center to cross the second; and up 
and to the right to cross the third. The animal when con- 
fined in the sunlight tries to get back to the opposite end 
of the tank which is shaded. He reacts to the situation at 
first by swimming against the screen, and bumping against 
it here and there along the bottom. He may stop and 
remain still for a while, but he will occasionally rise up 
towards the top of the water. When he happens to rise 
up to the top at the left-hand side, he has a clear pathway 
in front of him, and thus can cross the first partition. We 
have few detailed studies of motor habits in fishes: . Triplett 
has given an example of the formation of an interesting 
habit in the perch (Perca Americana). A glass tank was 
constructed 4x2x14 feet in size. The study was begun 
upon two of the perch. They were fed for several months 
upon live minnows 2 or 3 inches in length. At the begin- 
ning of the experiment in question a glass partition was 
placed in the tank and the food, of the perch changed to 
angle worms. Three times a week, Mondays, Wednesdays, 
and Fridays, for nearly a month, between the hours of 4 
and 5 in the afternoon the perch were fed, and after that 
on every day at that hour. In making the test the min- 
nows were put into their side of the tank for 30 minutes, 
during which time the behavior of the perch was observed. 
At the end of 30 minutes the minnows were removed until 
the next trial. Triplett’s note on their behavior follows: 
“Two minnows were placed in the tank at 4:30 p.M. The perch 
immediately began ramming the glass to get at them. Their actions 
became very violent as the minnows approached the partition. They 
ceased their butting and swam away from the glass for a few sec- 
onds after 7 minutes of continuous effort. A second trial lasting 
only 1 minute followed, and this was followed in turn by still 
shorter periods. The greater energy was shown always when the 
minnows turned their heads towards the perch, as it is only when 
they are ‘head on’ that the latter strike. At 4:55 the female was 
showing what seemed to be signs of anger and was striking the
-P-A-G-E-208
  194 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
glass hard. . . . By 5 o’clock both perch had left the glass and 
seemed to have given up the attempt completely.” 
On the second day their efforts were not so long continued 
nor so violent as on the first day. There was a gradual 
lessening of the time and energy spent in striking at the 
minnows. This depended, though, somewhat upon the 
state of hunger. By the end of a month the perch had 
ceased to strike at the minnows when the latter were put 
into the cage. The second step in the experiment then 
followed. The glass partition was raised and the minnows 
allowed to swim into the compartment containing the 
perch. The male perch paid not the slightest attention to 
the minnows. The female moved towards them several 
times but did not harm them. On succeeding days the 
minnows were admitted in the same way. Several times the 
perch started to stalk the minnows, but within a short dis- 
tance of their heads they turned aside. In the early trials 
before admitting the minnows the appetites of the perch 
had been dulled a little by feeding them with worms. In 
the later trials, however, this was not done. The third 
step in the experiment was to leave the minnows in the tank 
continuously for a week, separated from the perch only by 
the glass partition. The perch soon ceased entirely to touch 
the glass. They would frequently take up a position near 
the glass and watch the minnows playing on the other 
side within 2 or 3 inches of them. When the partition 
was removed they did not attack them any more than in 
the case just mentioned. 
The most interesting feature of Triplett’s experiment 
and the one which bears most plainly upon the motor side 
of habit formation comes out in his discussion of Bateson’s 
statements concerning the lack of habit-forming powers in 
fish. Bateson says: 
“None of the fish seemed to get any lasting appreciation of the 
nature of the plate-glass walls of the tank. The same fish will 
again and again knock its head and try to seize the objects moving 
on the other side. After repeated attempts to take food on the 
other side of the glass, they will desist, but some of the oldest 
inhabitants (plaice, pollock, and bream) which have been living in 
the aquarium for about a year will perseveringly try again the 
next time.”
-P-A-G-E-209
MOTOR HABITS IN REPTILES 195 
Triplett entirely disagrees with this. He says: 
“While these fish did not entirely cease striking the glass during 
the time when the trials were about 30 minutes long, their attempts 
grew very much more infrequent and ‘their blows feebler. Later, 
in the changed form of the experiment, becoming accustomed to 
the sight of the minnows, they gave up striking the glass, merely 
continuing to watch them. This, in connection with their conduct 
towards the minnows when the glass was removed, suggested that 
they have at least a strong temporary appreciation of the obstacle.” 
The strongest proof of the formation of a habit shows 
in their conduct after the partition itself had been removed. 
On reaching the place where the partition had formerly 
rested they stopped and turned back, advanced again, 
made little jumps towards it as if expecting to strike the 
usual obstruction and were plainly at a loss. They then 
turned and swam down as if following the glass. Ten days 
later, with the same conditions, they swam out to the mark 
‘several times and then turned and swam back. On a later 
occasion, when the glass was taken out, they turned 3 
times at the mark, but finally crossed it in a hesitating 
manner. 
Motor habits: reptiles.—The turtle has been studied in 
e laboratory by Yerkes. It is extremely sluggish in 
its movements. The impulse or incentive to get the ani- 
mal to work was that of escape) Instinctively the animal 
attempts to hide in some dark secluded place and will try 
to escape from confinement and go towards such a place. 
This combination serves very well for a motive. Hunger 
could not be used for a motive since the reptile does not 
eat well in confinement and its time of eating is very ir- 
regular and hard to control. The maze consisted of a 
simple box 3 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 10 inches deep. It 
was divided into 4 portions by partitions also 10 inches 
deep. At different points in the partitions a hole 4 inches 
long and 2 inches deep was cut. This permitted the passage 
of the animal. After passing through the last partition 
the animal could get to its darkened nest of damp grass. 
A small speckled turtle learned this simple maze as fol- 
lows: After wandering about constantly for 35 minutes, 
it chanced to find the nest, into which it immediately
-P-A-G-E-210
  196 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
crawled and remained there until taken out 2 hours later. 
Experiments were made every 2 hours. On the second 
trial the nest was reached in 15 minutes. There was much 
less wandering. The time for the third trial was 5 minutes; 
for the fourth, 3 minutes and 30 seconds. During the 
first three trials the course taken was so tortuous that 
records of it were hard to obtain. There was aimless 
wandering from point to point within each space, and from 
space to space. After the third trial the routes became ~ 
more direct. The tenth trial was made in 3 minutes and 5 
seconds, with only 2 mistakes in turning. The time of the 
twentieth trial was 45 seconds; that of the thirtieth, 40 
seconds. In the last experiment the course was direct, as 
was also true in the case of the fiftieth trip, which was made 
in. 35 seconds. 
Habits of manipulation: mammals.—}An interesting ex- 
ample of the manipulation of a complicated piece of ap- 
paratus appears in the tests on the rhesus monkey. 
This example illustrates the general features of habits of 
manipulation as weil as the complexity of such habits. 
The animal was first allowed to learn a series of simple 
problem boxes similar to those shown on p. 94 ff. After it 
had mastered a number of the boxes with simple fastenings 
a box was constructed which could not be opened until a 
combination of fastenings (made up from the earlier 
learned simple fastenings) had been released in serial 
order. In the particular case mentioned the monkey was 
required to bear down on a lever at the left of the box; to 
push in a bar at the right, and to pull out a string behind. 
These were all so arranged that when once moved they 
locked and could not be shaken back, and thus prevent the 
moving of the next part of the combination. The cut for 
this particular box is shown on p. 99. The monkey in at- 
tacking a box of this kind uses his hands incessantly. He 
tries first one and then the other in quick succession. One 
part worked, he tries all the others, though he may labor 
on one at a time and try often to move parts that have 
already been moved. A complete record of these move- 
ments is very instructive. In order to bring success these
-P-A-G-E-211
MOTOR HABITS IN BIRDS Lom) 
locks must be manipulated in the order 1, 2, 3, 4. The 
numbers are printed in bold-faced type whenever the move- 
ment was successfully accomplished. It will be seen that 
the animal tried each separate combination many times 
before successfully working it. The list here given is for 
a second trial. 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4,.2, 1, 2, 3, 1,

1, 3, 4. It will be seen from these figures that latch 2 was 
tried 19 times before it was really moved. The twentieth 
trial reads as follows: 2, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4 
The eighty-sixth trial reads: 2, 1, 2, 4, 8, 4 (Kinnaman). 
The raccoon and porcupine when tested on similar combi- 
nations show a remarkable degree of manual dexterity. 
They are capable of learning combinations fully as difficult 
ag the one under discussion. 
. Habits of manipulation: birds}Porter describes forma- 
tion of the habit in the English sparrow of opening a small 
food eage, the door to which was held in place by a latch. 
To the latch was attached a string which led out over the 
box in such a way that the bird, in crawling over the box, 
would press the string in, and thus raise the latch. The 
door would spring open of its own accord (p. 98). The 
behavior of one English sparrow, B, is described somewhat 
in the following manner: B succeeded in opening the door 
first by pushing in the string with his claws. On the first 
trial he hopped up to the left of the door, on the far end 
covered with wire, and climbed down over the sides 
from the top. He next walked along the front side with 
one foot on the floor and one on the side of the box. 
Finally he accidentally struck the right place and the box 
opened. The records show that the unnecessary reactions 
get fewer in number with each successive experiment. In 
the tenth test he had left off all of them. At about this 
time he began to use his bill on the string. Instead of 
pushing it with his claws he struck it with his bill. On 
the twenty-seventh test he no longer clung to the sides of 
the box while striking the string with his bill, but pulled the 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  198 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
string while standing on the floor. The time of the first 
trial was 10 minutes and 50 seconds; of the fifth trial, 3 
minutes; of the twelfth, 1 minute; of the twentieth, 15 
seconds; and of the thirty-fifth trial, 6 seconds. It will be 
seen that the above manipulation device is extremely simple 
in character. The structural relations and methods of 
living of reptiles, amphibia, and fish make it difficult to 
test their ability to form habits of manipulation. Up to 
the present time no such habits have been reported. 
Sensory habits.—It would take us entirely too far afield 
to discuss sensory habits in detail as we have the two types 
of motor habits. Reference to p. 61, where methods of 
forming such habits are discussed, and to pp. 220 and 222, 
where the learning curves and the analyses of sensory 
habits, respectively, are treated, will give a fairly definite 
idea of how such habits are formed. For similar reason the 
delayed reaction is not treated separately here. Reference 
should be made to p. 224. 
III. Curves of learning: motor habits.—Enough ex- 
amples at least of motor habits have been given to show 
their common characteristics. The first few trials always 
require a large amount of excess time; succeeding trials 
require less and less time. If the total distance the animal 
traverses in reaching the food in successive trials is re- 
corded instead of the time, the same situation appears. 
In the maze, e.g., the rat, on its first trial, may run 400 
meters (when the distance from entrance to food box is 
448 meters) before finally reaching the food. On his 
fiftieth trial he may not take a useless step. Investigators 
usually plot curves of learning in terms of time or distance 
and number of trials. Below is presented the curve for 
the learning of the maze by white rats (27). The number 
of trials is marked off along the abscisse and the units 
of time and distance along the ordinates. The average of 
the time and of the total distance is recorded at each suc- 
cessive trial. In general it may be seen that there is an 
enormous drop in both the time and the distance curves 
on the first 8 or 9 trials. All succeeding trials show a slow 
and steady decrease in time and distance, until at the

seventieth trial the animal reaches the normal physiological 
limit of training. The habit is perfected. Individual 
animals differ somewhat as might be expected in the abso-

lute time required to run the necessary distance (4.48 
meters). 
The peculiar shape of the learning curve, the initial 
abrupt slope, has led to much speculation. We cannot 
enter very profitably into a discussion of this subject be- 
cause at the present time our knowledge of learning curves 
is limited to a very few of those illustrating the simple 
sensory and motor acquisitions. It is probable that the 
curve of learning of very complicated acts would not have 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  200 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
this initial abrupt slope. Many other factors enter in to 
determine the contour of the learning curve: the number 
of trials necessary to learn the act as a whole; the absolute 
and relative rates of elimination of excess time and excess 
distance at each trial; the number of trials allowed each

day; the age of the animal; its sex, ete. Some of these 
factors will be considered in part on p. 235. 
Curves of learning: sensory habits.—Even a superficial 
examination of the curve illustrating the acquisition of a 
sensory habit will show that the fall of the curve (i.e., the 
curve of error) is a very gradual one. In acquiring such 
6 These curves are further discussed on p. 206, i
-P-A-G-E-215
  
CURVES OF LEARNING 201 
habits where no initial preference is noted the number of 
wrong responses and the number of right responses ought 
to be approximately equal on the first few trials. Fig. 37 
shows the growth of such habits (Hoge and Stocking). 
Gradually,7 and usually very gradually, the number of 
right responses exceeds the number of wrong responses 
until finally all the responses are right and the habit 
is formed. Here again, the method of conducting the 
test alters the character of the curve, eg., the number 
of tests made on a given day; whether punishment 
is given alone for wrong choice and food alone for 
right; or whether food is given for right response and 
punishment for wrong, ete. Many other factors are at 
hand which alter the general character of the learning 
curve, such as the amount and kinds of previous practice 
the animal may have had; differences in instinctive traits, 
such as boldness, fear; the amount and kinds of distrac- 
tion, etc.; the general method of attacking the problems; 
and finally the method of plotting the actual data may 
alter greatly the general appearance of the curve—telescop- 
ing of trials and time, etc. When one considers all of the 
factors which actually modify learning, and the different 
methods of treating the data on learning, it is not to be 
wondered at that there is no such thing as a characteristic 
and typical curve of learning. In conducting experiments, 
though, the various factors can be controlled; at least we 
can make the conditions of learning comparable for all the 
animals being experimented upon, and we can vary any 
one factor at will so as to bring out differences in the learn- 
ing ability of young animals and old, male and female, 
normal and defective, etc. 
Motor habits in the human being.—Tests upon the 
acquisition of simple motor habits have been made upon 
human beings, e.g., learning to typewrite ; to toss and catch 
balls, to shoot with the long bow, ete. The general features 
7 Some exceptions to this rule are to be noted even here, In 
Shepherd’s work on the discrimination of colored foodstuffs by 
monkeys where wrong response was punished with a bitter taste, 
quinine, the habit arose very quickly (p. 347),
-P-A-G-E-216
  202 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
of these curves of learning are quite similar to those of the 
animals. Usually there is an abrupt drop and then a 
somewhat gradual decline until the physiological limit is 
reached. Even here, though, the contour of the curve is 
dependent upon the complexity of the act, the method of 
treating the data, ete. The curves of Book, Swift and 
Bryan and Harter exhibit usually an abrupt descent. In’ 
the curve of archery which we have obtained the slope is 
very gradual. Improvement is slow at first and continues 
slow throughout. In an individual case there was no im- 
provement even at the end of the three hundredth trial. 
Some of these curves.seem to exhibit what are called pla- 
teaux and breathing places, although not all of them do. 
These places—where the curve remains horizontal, showing 
neither gain nor loss—need explanation. It is probable 
that their explanation is to be found in the failure to con- 
trol the incentives (p. 204). No such plateaux or resting 
places are to be found in the curves illustrating the motor 
acquisitions of animals. When an animal has to work or 
remain hungry; to make a correct response at an alley or 
be punished, ete., the incentive may be said to remain at a 
maximum. The situation is clearly different when human 
beings are forced to learn to typewrite. The act is a very 
complex one and the stimuli leading to action are not 
compelling. If a man’s food (reactions to sex stimuli, 
shelter, etc.) were dependent upon acquiring skill in a 
certain line—conditions which we can now control in the 
animals—such resting places and plateaux would in all 
probability disappear from his learning curves. 
Comparative learning ability of different animals.— 
We have little accurate comparative data at present upon 
the differences in the learning ability of the different phyla. 
The statement is often made and is probably true that the 
monkey, with his superb eye-hand codrdinations, can form 
habits of manipulation much more quickly than any 
of the other animals. From the work that has been pre- — 
sented by several investigators it is probable that the 
raccoon stands next to the monkey, and after him the 
porcupine and then the cat. Probably the dog should
-P-A-G-E-217
  
LEARNING ABILITY 203 
appear next, yet the rat is extremely apt in forming simple 
habits of manipulation. On the other hand, mammals 
like the guinea pig and the rabbit are clumsy in forming 
such habits. The bird class as a whole is notoriously poor 
in acquiring acts of skill. 
On the other hand, the rat stands preéminent among the 
animals in his ability to thread a complicated maze, and 
the gray squirrel probably stands next to him in this 
ability. The monkey, however, acquires the maze habit 
readily. Birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibia form maze 
its with very great slowness. Birds can, with great 
culty learn oe mazes, but the amphibia, 
     been made for the purpose of comparing the relative learn- 
ing ability of blindfolded human adults, children, and blind 
white rats to learn a maze under approximately comparable 
conditions. While the conditions for rat and man differed 
sufficiently to make comparison difficult, it would seem 
that the absolute number of trials was less for the rats than 
for the human subjects. When one compares the rapidity 
of the elimination of excess time and distance (i.e., time 
over and above that required to traverse the maze when 
the habit is learned, and distance over that of the length 
of the true pathway from entrance to food) one finds that 
the human subjects make such eliminations much more 
slowly than do the animals. On the other hand, the ani- 
mals start with a much larger number of excess factors and 
sow a very much greater variability all through their 
learning curves than do human subjects (Hicks and Carr). 
We have little comparative data on the relative ability of 
different varieties of animals to form sensory habits. Since 
the motor and instinctive equipments of the different ani- 
mal groups differ so enormously it is doubtful if we shall 
ever have any accurate means of grading animals with 
regard to the rapidity with which they can form motor 
i On the other hand, there seems to be no real reason 
why birds and monkeys, e.g., may not be accurately com- 
_ with respect to the rapidity with which they form,

visual sensory habits, ete. The interpretation of such dif- 
ferences in learning ability (were such found to exist) 
would be as difficult as in the case of motor habits. Dif- 
ferences in learning might.be due to differences in sen- 
sitivity to the stimuli rather than to differences in the 
rapidity with which the ares are established (assuming 
that the response demanded is on a par in the two cases). 
Until our determinations of the range of effective stimuli, 
the relative stimulating effect of stimuli, etc., have been 
carried much farther, observed differences in learning 
among the different phyla do not mean very much. 
IV. The rise of habits when incentives are controlled. 
—It can hardly be said that behavior has yet developed 
any very complete methods of controlling incentives. Pun- 
ishment in one form or another for wrong reactions and 
food for right response have been used as controls since 
animals have been trained. In training for circus work 
the two incentives have usually been combined. In such 
work the whip has been largely employed and still is the 
mainstay of the professional trainer. With them, how- 
ever, the whip serves the double purpose,—that of punish- 
ing when wrong response is made and that of giving the 
signals or cues to which the animals respond. 
Apparently Elmer Gates * was the first person to employ 
the method of induction shocks. Since his experiment is 
not very well known and has not been largely quoted, we 
give a brief abstract of his experiment upon the dog. On 
the floor of a hall were placed colored metal squares. All 
of the squares, except those of a given color, were connected 
with an induction coil. The dog, in passing down the hall, 
had to jump from one square to another. By jumping only 
upon same colored squares he could pass safely through 
the hall without receiving punishment. 
Yerkes has very greatly extended the use of Gates’ 
method (p. 59). His work on behavior, coupled with that 
of Martin on the standardization of the Porter induc- 
torium, gives us our first approach to a real control of 
incentives. Some of the difficulties in the use of the 
® The Monist, 1895, p. 584.
-P-A-G-E-219
CONTROL OF INCENTIVES 205 
method have already been discussed. As we have pointed 
out, no scientific control of the other incentives seems pos- 
sible, and yet certain steps in that direction may be taken 
with food (p. 58). A good practical method, as we have 
already remarked, in regard to the use of food, is that of - 
allowing the animal to eat sparingly of mixed necessary 
food after each trial, and then either to satiety at the end 
of the daily routine of tests or else for a specified length of 
time. In the discussion of the experiments which follows 
some such method of food control, either during the tests 
or after them, is always used. Even when punishment is 
used alone, the control of food is a necessary factor. 
Habits formed without the use of punishment.—Since 
the punishment method has come into favor very slowly 
and has some serious limitations, we find that much of the 
work upon both sensory and motor habits mentioned in 
the literature on behavior has been carried on in the ab- 
sence of punishment. Certain other incentives, of which 
we cannot make separate mention, have been used, such as 
escape, from narrow quarters, escape from cold, from 
bright light, etc. Examples of habit formation under such 
conditions have been given on p. 193 and p. 195. 
With ‘punishment as the sole incentive.—It would 
seem to be establisAed by experimentation upon sensory 
habits (1) that when the difference between the two di- 
rective stimuli is great, the rapidity of learning increases 
os the strength of the electric stimulus (punishment) in- 
creases from the threshold of stimulation up to the point 
where the current becomes dangerous to the tissue. This 
law may be looked upon as holding for what we may call 
easy habits. (2) Where the habit arises with some diffi- 
eulty, ie., where the intensity difference between the two 
stimuli is less, there seems to be at present no clear rela- 
tionship between the number of trials necessary to learn the 
ms and the strength of the punishment. In general it 
will probably be found that there is an optimal strength 
of stimulus for every difference in intensity between the 
two stimuli upon the basis of which a habit is to be estab- 
lished. Suppose, e.g., we are working with two lights. 
   
-P-A-G-E-220
    
206 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
The difference in intensity maintained may be 10 ep., 5 
ep. or 1 ep. Only experimentation could decide what 
strength of stimulus should be used with any one of these 
differences in intensity. Yerkes has stated the general law 
as follows: ‘‘ As difficultness of visual discrimination in- 
ereases, that strength of electrical stimulus which is most 
favorable to habit formation approaches the threshold. The 
easier the habit the stronger that stimulus which most 
quickly forces its acquisition; the more difficult the habit 
the weaker the stimulus which most quickly forces its 
acquisition.’’ ; 
With punishment for wrong response and food for 
right——So far only one set of results has been obtained 
upon this subject. It would seem from work upon the 
white rat, where a habit of responding positively to the 
brighter of two lights (2 e.p. and 16 ¢.p.) was desired, 
that punishment for failure and food for right response 
give the most advantageous situation for the rise of the 
habit. Fig. 37, p. 200, shows these results.° This work 
needs confirming by the use of a much larger number of 
animals than was employed. 
V. Analysis of reflexes involved in habit—So far in 
our discussion we have spoken of habits as though they 
consisted of only a few well-directed and definite muscular 
movements; as though the complex stimulus (problem 
box, maze, ete.) called forth on first presentation a large 
number of random acts, among which acts were to be found 
those necessary to obtain food (to escape punishment, 
ete.), and on later presentations fewer and fewer excess 
movements. Finally the stimulus arouses the few neces- 
sary acts in serial order. Such an illustration fits very 
well those cases of habit where the movements are simple 
and definite in character, such as pulling a string, knock- 
ing up a latch, ete. But certain habits are enormously 
complex. Consider, e.g., the learning of the Hampton 
* A reference to this figure shows ,that where no punishment was 
used (R) the habit was not perfected within the time limits of the 
experiment; where punishment alone was used 610 trials were re- 
quired (P); where reward and punishment were combined only 530 
trials were necessary (RP).
-P-A-G-E-221
ANALYSIS OF MOTOR HABITS 207 
  Court maze, with its many possibilities of false turns. It 
is evident that in order to thread this maze as a whole it 
is necessary for the animal to have a series of simple habits 
(i.e., one wherever an error of turn is possible) of the 
character we have just considered. It becomes necessary 
in the prediction and control of behavior to make an 
analysis both of the simple types of habits and of the most 
complex. We should like to be able to state, were such 
possibilities of analysis ideal, (1) the number, location, and 
serial order of functioning of the reflex ares from the 
initial response until food is reached; and (2) the stimulus 
which releases each arc. Furthermore there is some evi- 
dence that these systems of ares change somewhat as the 
habit passes from the initial stage to the final or automatic 
stage. We may possibly make this latter point clearer by 
saying that in the early stages visual, auditory, tactual, 
ete., stimuli are all functioning (necessary for the release 
of the appropriate motor impulse), whereas in the later 
stage only the kinesthetic *° are functional. There is less 
and less resistance in the synapses of the kinesthetic ares 
and probable actual blockage in the synapses of the ares 
of the distance receptors. The movement of muscle 1 (it 
will be remembered that such muscles contain sensory 
neurons as well as motor) sets up a sensory stimulus which, 
upon entrance into the proper place in the central nervous 
system, releases a motor impulse which brings about move- 
ment 2. This routine continues until the whole train of 
movements has been run off. It is thus seen that the 
muscle is at one and the same time the effector of the are 
in operation and the receptor of the are which is next to 
function. The notion that every habit is of this character 
is more or less current. That this need not be true may 
easily be understood when we consider that the stimulus 
to movement 1 may be olfactory, visual, ete., but move- 
ment 1, however released, may set up an auditory stimulus 
1° By kinesthetic we mean the sensory impulse aroused by the 
contraction of the muscle. When the muscle contracts the muscle 
spindles (sensory nerve endings in muscles) are chemically stimu- 
lated. The endings in the tendons are aroused at the same time.
-P-A-G-E-222
  208 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
(the animal may run over a trap which causes a door to 
drop,—auditory but no visual stimulus). The succeeding 
movement, movement 2, may be released now through at 
least two avenues: (a) the sensory impulse coming from 
the muscles used in springing the trap; (b) through audi- 
tory impulse aroused by the impact of the falling door. As 
we watch the behavior of a normal animal while executing 
a customary act we find ourselves wholly unable to state 
what impulses are functioning. Special types of experi- 
mentation are necessary for analysis and for tracing the 
history of a habit. Suppose (to take a very simple case) 
we train an animal to open box III, p. 95, with all sense 
organs intact. After training we may begin analysis: the 
auditory impulse may be blocked by eliminating the sense 
organ (operative method), or it may not be aroused at all, 
which may be effected by padding the door (normal 
method). We may find that the animal can still execute 
movement 2, ie., run to the door, enter it, ete. On the 
other hand, we may begin our analysis in the learning stage 
by forcing the animal to learn with certain stimuli absent. 
Actual tests show that learning may proceed with the 
auditory stimulus absent, or in an animal with auditory 
organ destroyed; but the character of the learning curve 
may or may not be altered, depending upon the animal 
used. In the laboratory in order to evaluate results we 
have proceeded upon the assumptions (1) if the trained 
animal can as quickly and with as little excess effort exe- 
cute the habit under consideration after the auditory 
stimulus has been removed through normal or operative 
methods, we are justified in concluding that movement 1 
gives the impulse which releases movement 2. On the 
other hand, (2), if, after the loss of the auditory stimulus, 
there is a serious break in the habit, we must conclude that 
the auditory stimulus functioned at least along with the 
kinesthetic. If, (3) after the loss of the auditory stimulus, 
the animal can relearn the problem, we conclude that the 
kinesthetic impulse may come to function alone, i.e., be 
completely substituted for the auditory. If the animal (4) 
deprived of the auditory stimulus, by whatever means, can
-P-A-G-E-223
ANALYSIS OF MOTOR HABITS 209 
learn the problem in as short a time and with as little 
excess effort as the animal not deprived of the auditory 
stimulus, we can conclude that the stimulus of movement 2 
is kinesthetic; whereas (5) if learning is more difficult, 
we assume that the auditory stimulus is functioning in 
normal learning. The right of making such conclusions 
from the premises stated has been questioned somewhat in 
the literature. Some authors would have us believe that 
the animals have a nervous system so delicately constructed 
that there can be an immediate shift in the ares; e.g., if in 
cases where distance receptors are functioning in a well- 
established habit we block impulses over those avenues, they 
maintain that there may be an immediate shift to kinews- 
thetic impulses with no break in the habit. Such a view 
must have some factual support before it need be seriously 
considered. This simple illustration makes it obvious that 
habit analysis forces us to resort to methods of elimination 
of stimuli. This may be considered under two heads; 
normal methods and operative methods. 
Normal and operative methods of eliminating sensory 
impulses.—Since many investigators object to removing 
the sense organs in animals, various normal methods have 
been devised. The simplest way of excluding visual im- 
pulses, e.g., is to work in a dark room; to exclude audi- 
tory impulses, to work with noiseless instruments; to 
exclude olfactory impulses, thoroughly to cleanse and wash 
the apparatus after each experiment. Animals may be 
trained with these stimuli present until the habit becomes 
automatic. These stimuli may then be removed and the 
effect noted upon the execution of the act. On the other 
hand, we may force the animal to learn with several of such 
stimuli excluded. The objections to the use of normal 
methods are many and serious. We have proceeded usually 
upon the assumption that the sensitivity of the receptor of 
a given animal to a particular form of stimulation is the 
same as our own. 
The error of such a procedure appears clearly when we 
consider the olfactory sensitivity of many animals. Wash- 
ing and even boiling the maze may not conclusively elimi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  210 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
nate the olfactory stimulation, i.e., such as trails, ete., for 
certain animal forms. On the other hand, if we wish to ex- 
elude visual stimulation by working in a dark room, we 
eliminate, pay'i-passu, the experimenter’s possibility of ob- 
serving the behavior of the animal. 
The safest method, in the case of distance receptors, is 
to remove the organ. When this is done under proper 
operative condition, most animals are abnormal only with 
respect to those functions for which we desire abnormal- 
ity..1. The normal method can give us only indications of 
the data, and can never be'said to furnish scientific proof 
of their existence.1? It must be obvious that while we are 
principally concerned with the analysis of motor ares, 
methods of eliminating undesirable sensory stimuli must 
be constantly employed in the establishment of sensory 
labits, and habits of the delayed reaction type. On p. 63 
we mention the necessity for control of this kind. Were it 
possible, in work upon certain aspects of vision, to use 
animals in which only the visual receptors with the neces- 
sary effectors were functioning, our results could be ob- 
tained with far greater accuracy than at present. 
Some results of experimental analysis of motor 
habits in mammals.—The simple case of habit analysis 
discussed on p. 208 enables us to examine in detail a much 
more complicated case—that which the rat forms in the 
Hampton Court maze (p. 103). One is struck immediately 
by the peculiar rapidity and neatness with which the rat 
learns to thread this maze. Fig. 38 gives the learning 
curve of 4 normal rats. It will be seen that on the average 
29 minutes are required for a first successful trip and that 
by the end of the thirtieth trial this time has been reduced 
to approximately 30 seconds. As we see the rat threading 
this complicated maze with never a false step, we get no 
‘1 Birds offer an exception to this observation in so far as visual 
receptors are concerned. 
12 For obvious reasons we cannot enter into a complete treatment 
of the operative methods and technique. The reader is referred to 
the author’s paper, Psychological Monograph No. 33, and to that of 
Florence Richardson, Psychological Monograph No. 48. In order to 
avoid all criticisms it is best to have such operations made under 
medical supervision, and where possible by physicians themselves,

indication of the system of ares involved in the execution 
of the act as a whole. The sensory avenues may be very 
numerous. On early trials the animals cover every square 
inch of space, passing in and out of the culs de sac, coming 
back to the entrance, advancing, returning again, etc. Soon 
the animal passes by the openings into the culs de sac at A

and B (Fig. 25). Gradually those further along are safely 
passed and finally the whole run is made without error. 
It is obvious that learning to avoid any one of these culs de 
sac may be looked upon, for convenience, as involving the 
formation of a habit. Since there are several culs de sac it 
is clear that we have several unit habits ‘‘ chained ’’ to- 
gether. After all these units are formed and concatenated,
-P-A-G-E-226
  212 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
  learning is said to be complete.** Two questions arise: 
(1) What process is involved in forming any one of these 
unit habits? We have the same condition at each cul de sac 
that we have in the simple habit considered above, random 
movements giving place finally to the right movement, 
ie., making the proper turn or keeping straight ahead. 
We have already spoken of deferring this discussion to 
Chapter VII. The answer to these questions does not 
involve an analysis of the arcs employed. It gives a reason 
in mechanical terms for the more or less complete elimina- 
tion of all random movements. (2) What systems of recep- 
tors are involved in the various parts of the maze—the 
straight-aways as opposed to the turns, the culs de sac, ete.? 
‘We can conceive of the animal, deprived of all its distance 
receptors, walking or running from the entrance to the 
food box. Each movement executed would arouse new 
contact and kinesthetic impulses which in turn would 
release the succeeding movement. It is difficult to conceive 
of such a defective animal learning the maze de novo. 
When an animal, after leavirig O, arrives at A, the first 
cul de sac, the sensory situation becomes more complex 
than in the alleys. There are differences in the optical 
stimulation offered, differences in the olfactory, and dif- 
ferences in contact, since the vibrisse on the left are in 
contact with the walls of the maze, while those on the right 
are not in contact. Furthermore, there are differences in 
the direction and intensity of the air currents and in 
temperature. Likewise the auditory stimulation is differ- 
ent—there are differences in the reflection of the sound of 
the animal’s own footsteps, ete.—and finally kinesthetic 
impulses change. The possibility of a change in the form 
of stimulation at the entrance of the cul de sac as con- 
trasted with that in the alleys is very great. The question 
arises: are all of these impulses necessary for the release 
of the movement which carries the animal safely past the 
cul de sac? If all are not necessary, which ones are? 
Furthermore, all (or many) may be necessary in the early 
78 On p. 261 we show that concatenation is not a vart of the 
process; it appears ipso facto when errors are eliminated.

stages of the habit, but only the kinesthetic in the auto- 
matic stage. These questions we have attempted to answer 
by experimental methods. (1) We first trained several 
animals in daylight and then tested them in darkness. The 
appended table shows that the animals executed the habit 
in the dark in as short a time as in the light. This is

  merely indicative of the fact that after the habit is learned 
it can be executed automatically without the use of the 
visual receptors. (2) We then forced several rats to learn 
the maze in the dark. They likewise learned in normal 
time. (Fig. 39.) Could we be sure that vision was com- 
pletely excluded in this learning process, we should have 
good evidence that vision is not necessary to the forma- 
tion of this habit. In order completely to control our work, 
we eliminated vision by removing the sense organs in two 
groups of animals, one (3) wholly untrained in the maze 
and (4) the other trained to it. When brought to test the 
untrained animals learned the maze as rapidly as did the 
normal animals. (Fig. 40.) The trained group of blind

It has later been shown that conditions can be so arranged 
in the maze that ares other than   kinesthetic are necessary 
to the formation of the habit. It may be objected that
-P-A-G-E-231
  ANALYSIS OF MOTOR HABITS 217 
the evidence so far advanced is purely negative, obtained 
by the exclusion of data other than kinesthetic, conse- 
quently that we have no real proof of a positive character 
to show that the kinesthetic arcs really function in the way 
in which we maintain. Very definite and positive proof 
that our main thesis is right has been furnished by taking 
a maze that could be shortened or lengthened without alter- 
ing the relations of the turns. Fig. 26, p. 104, shows this 
form. Two groups of animals were trained upon this maze, 
one group in its shortened and the other in its lengthened 
form. Animals that had been trained with the lengthened 
form were tried with the shortened form. Q in the diagram 
is thus made to take the position Q’. Under this change 
the animals released at O gathered speed as they made 
the various turns and then. ran with full strength into the 
wall at 1. With the kinesthetic ares functioning, the extra- 
organically aroused impulses (visual stimulation of walls, 
ete.) were unable to inhibit the customary movements. 
When the animals that had learned the shortened form were 
tested in the lengthened form, they tried to turn in at the 
places where formerly they had turned in. Again the evi- 
dence is conclusive. The turns had been made hitherto 
solely on the basis of proprio-ceptive impulses. Changing 
to the lengthened form brought no immediate change in 
these impulses, so the animal tried to turn into the solid 
wall. As soon, however, as the failure occurred, the old 
chain broke and the new habit was formed—i.e., of going 
forward several inches and then turning. Many other ex- 
periments furnished the needed positive proof that was 
lacking in the elimination method. 
One objection has been raised to the resolving of the 
maze habit process into the functioning of a serially 
chained kinesthetic are system. It may be stated as fol- 
lows: in man and in animals kinesthetic ares function in 
perfect habits until some disturbance occurs, i.e., until 
rival impulses coming in over other receptors become suffi- 
ciently strong to produce inhibition of the customary move- 
ments. It is held that a similar situation exists in the case 
of the rat in the maze. The animal may be automatically

  218 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
traversing the maze at a high rate of speed when suddenly 
a loud noise, a strange odor, or an intense itching occurs. 
The chain of movements is broken. How now does auto- 
maticity become reéstablished? The human being under 
similar circumstances—when momentarily lost while exe- 
cuting a purely automatic habit—remains unoriented until 
supplementary distance sense data are at hand; e.g., he 
glances at the score if playing a piece of music. These rela- 
tions at hand, the reign of the kinesthetic arcs is reéstab- 
lished and the automatic character of the acts again becomes 
apparent. But in the case of the rat do distance sense 
data function in this way? We conclude, on the basis of a 
large amount of experimental work, that automaticity is 
reéstablished for the rat solely from the distinctive 
kinesthetic impulses which function exactly as do the 
visual impulses in the case just stated for man. If the 
trained rat is put down in a part of the maze other than 
the entrance, he runs at first randomly. He may wander 
about, turn round and round in the alleys, but suddenly 
he darts off and traverses the remainder of the maze in the 
usual automatic way. We hold that during the period of 
random activity the animal passed over what we may call 
a ‘‘ kinesthetic unit,’’ thereby arousing a certain sequence 
of the kinesthetic impulses which could not be aroused in 
any other part of the maze. This distinctive group of 
impulses is sufficient to reéstablish automaticity. Exami- 
nation of any maze shows that there are several ways in 
which kinesthetic impulses become grouped: (a) two run- 
ways are unequal in length; (b) they may be of equal length 
but occur in different positions of the total series, i.e., they 
are preceded by different conditions; (c) they may be alike 
in every respect except that one may be entered by a turn 
to the right and the other by a turn to the left; (d) the 
runs may be of, the same length and be entered from the 
same direction but present possible differences in their 
stimulating effect by reason of the fact that they extend in 
different directions (180°, ete., rotation of the maze, which 
changes only the absolute direction of the run-ways, pro- 
duces marked disturbance in habit). When the unori-
-P-A-G-E-233
    
ANALYSIS OF MOTOR HABITS 219 
ented animal passes over any distinctive part of the maze, 
the kinesthetic impulses arise, releasing the old movements. 
We are far from maintaining that we have a complete 
analysis of the maze habit even in the case of the rat.'* 
Some experiments in the maze showed quite clearly that 
there still are unanalyzed factors. If the Hampton Court 
maze is rotated 180°, normal, blind, and anosmic animals 
are disturbed, i.e., a breakdown occurs in the execution of 
the habit. What this disturbance is due to is not clear. 
It may depend upon the disturbance of sensory impulses 
which are already known (i.e., no new systems of receptors 
are required for its explanation). 
Analysis of motor habits in birds.—The bird stands in 
marked contrast to the rat with respect to its behavior in 
the maze. In the first place it is very difficult to get the 
bird to learn a maze as complicated as that which the rat 
learns with ease. Consequently experiments have been car- 
ried out upon birds with much simpler mazes. While ex- 
perimental analysis is not so complete as in the case of the 
rat, it is quite evident that distance receptors play a very 
large role if not a preponderating one in the formation and 
execution of this habit. The bird is so constructed physio- 
logically that visual impulses are necessary for motor activ- 
ity of any kind. Hence it is impossible to exclude light, 
either by normal methods or operative methods, and get the 
animal to learn at all. This makes it extremely difficult 
to test the actual réle of vision. On the other hand, birds 
show almost no trace of sensitivity to olfactory impressions 
(p. 403). Hence it is highly improbable that olfactory ares 
function in this habit. In general it seems safe to conclude 
that analysis will show that visual ares, auditory ares, and 
kinesthetic ares are all functional. It is perfectly clear 
from all the work upon the formation of maze habits that 
birds never become the automata that rats becomé.® 
** In the more recent work of Bogardus and Henke it is claimed 
that the number of contacts (touches with snout) made at the 
corners by untrained rats whose vibrisse were removed is directly 
in proportion to the number of errors made in learning the maze. 
*° It is interesting to note that birds apparently never dash into 
partitions in work on the shortened and lengthened forms of the

  220 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
Analysis of sensory habits in mammals.—For purposes 
of analysis we will take some sensory habits which the rat 
forms when confronted with monochromatic lights. The 
method of conducting such tests is given on p. 61, the 
apparatus on p. 71. When this animal was stimulated 
simultaneously by the lights red, 6554, and green, 
505¢@, a habit developed. In this case the animal re- 
sponded positively to red and negatively to green. Ten 
to twenty trials per day were given. After 555 trials the 
animal became automatic in his responses. He was then 
considered ready for control tests. In the training series 
the energy of the two monochromatic bands was not known. 
As the results of the experiment stand we are not able to 
define the stimulus which led to response. The results might 
be interpreted in three ways: (1) the animal may have been 
responding on the basis of wave-length difference ; (2) upon 
the basis of intensity difference; (3) only one stimulus was 
effeetive—the other stimulus lying wholly outside the sen- 
sory range of the animal. If the latter supposition were 
true, it remained to find out which light was stimulating the 
animal.’® Control tests to decide among these suppositions 
maze, or when obstacles are placed in the way. Some experiments 
were made in the Hopkins Laboratory (by Dr. Ulrich) to test 
whether pigeons, after hopping (and “half flying”) to a food box 
1 meter away, would hop short or over the food, depending upon 
whether the box had been brought nearer to the starting point or 
moved farther away. As is well shown by Richardson, rats, when 
trained to jump, e.g., 20 inches for food, are unable to adjust for new 
distances without training. If, e.g., they are trained to jump 20 
inches and the box is brought 12 inches forward, the animal jumps to 
the old distance, 20 inches. He jumps short if the food box is moved 
farther away, e.g., to 28 inches. The pigeon, on the other hand. makes 
these adjustments with equal readiness regardless of the distance. 
Tests were made within the limits of .75 meter on either side of 
the mid position. All of the work so far carried out on the rat’s 
motor habits show the almost complete dominance of the proprio- 
ceptive impulses over the skeletal muscles. In contrast to this it 
appears that the skeletal muscles in the pigeon are dominated by 
the impulses from the visual receptors. 
+° Tt should be made clear that sensory habits may arise where 
two stimuli are present when only one stimulus is effective. Fur- 
thermore, the non-effective stimulus may be either positive or 
negative.

ANALYSIS OF SENSORY HABITS 221 
were begun with rather striking results. A diary record 
of the control tests follows: 
  1911. 
March 7th. Red (positive) full intensity. Green cut to 11% of full 
intensity. 15 trials. 93% correct. 
March 8th. Green full intensity. Red cut to 11% of full intensity. 
15 trials. 100% correct. 
March 9th. Red full intensity. Green cut to 2.7% of full intensity. 
11 trials. 40% correct. Complete loss of habit. Then immedi- 
ately afterwards 9 trials were given with both stimuli full in- 
tensity. 100% of correct choices. 
March 10th., Conditions as beginning of test on previous day. 15 
trials. 53% correct. Complete loss of habit. 5 trials were 
then given with both stimuli at full intensity. 100% correct. 
From March 11th to March 16th certain experiments were tried 
to determine the effect of external illumination upon the dis- 
crimination. These experiments were so unsatisfactory that 
mention of the results is omitted. By June 5th the animals 
were again trained to react perfectly to red and green. Further 
control experiments to determine the nature of the effective 
stimulus were then undertaken. 
June 5th. 8 normal trials were first given. 100% correct. Then 
red beam was cut out. Green left at full intensity. Went to 
red side (darkness) on every trial (10 trials). 
June 6th. 8 normal trials. 100% correct. Green was cut out and 
red left at full intensity. Right position habit developed im- 
mediately. Discrimination lost. Then 4 normal trials were 
given. 100% correct. 
June 7th. 8 normal trials. 100% correct. Green out, red at full 
intensity. 14 trials given. Right position habit developed im- 
mediately. 4 normal trials were then given. 100% correct. 
June 10th. 8 normal trials were given. 100% correct. Red cut 
out, green full intensity. Went to red side (darkness) on 
all 15 trials. 2 normal trials were next given. Both correct. 
June 11th. 6 normal trials given. 100% correct. Green out, red 
full intensity. Left position habit developed immediately. (9 
trials.) Then 10 normal trials were given. 90% correct. 
June 12th. 6 normal trials given. 100% correct. Both lights cut 
out for 15 trials. Right position habit developed. 4 normal 
trials were given. 100% correct.'* 
These results seem to show perfectly that the green was 
the effective stimulus and that the red had no stimulating 
value whatsoever. The animal was reacting against a lighted 
compartment. One might decrease the intensity of the 
green light enormously and eliminate the red altogether, 
17In all of the control tests food might be had regardless of the stimulus reacted to. Food was always kept in both compartments even during the training series.  
-P-A-G-E-236
  222 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
without changing the accuracy of the responses. When, 
however, the intensity of the green approached the 
threshold, as on March 9th, a disturbance immediately 
manifested itself. Whenever the green was cut out the 
animal behaved exactly as though no light stimulus were 
present (contrast tests of June 11th with those of June 
12th). These results seem to show that-we are dealing with 
a defect in the receptor. Summarizing the results we 
find: (1) that the green was the effective stimulus; (2) 
that the red had no stimulating effect. The results harmon- 
ize with the hypothesis that the red chosen lay outside of the 
animal’s spectrum. 
It follows from this experiment that supposition (3) was 
correct. But from our results we are still unable to define 
the nature of the stimulus—we do not know from them 
whether the animal was reacting on the basis merely of its 
intensity or whether its wave-length was a factor also. We 
might easily have carried the experiment farther and tested 
whether the animal would have responded as readily to 
a white light as to the green. Instead, however, we began 
experiments upon two other rats, using stimuli both of 
which lay in the sensory range of the animal, viz., yellow, 
595éu, and blue, 478uu. In this case No. I re- 
sponded positively to blue and No. II, positively to yellow. 
One interesting fact was brought out very clearly: when 
both stimuli were in the ‘field the animal failed to form 
the habit within the time limits of the test. In order to 
hasten the growth of the habit only one stimulus (the posi- 
tive in each case) was used. As might have been predicted 
from our tests on red and green, the habit arose readily. 
Then (with energy of both stimuli known) we introduced 
the negative stimulus. As fast as possible, without breaking 
down the habit, the intensity of the negative stimulus was 
increased. The following table shows the results of this 
test. Column 1 gives the number of days the test endured, 
and column 2 shows the angular opening of the sector. An 
opening of 10° admits a beam of very low intensity. 
At 360° the full intensity of the beam was utilized (i.e., 
the two stimuli possessed equal energy, but did not contain

equal stimulating value). Column 3 gives the percentages 
of correct responses (in 10—20 trials).

This shows almost perfect animal was reacting to in- 
habit at equal energy. tensity and that blue at 
20°-30° had the same 
stimulating effect as the

A difference in the behavior of the two animals becomes at 
once apparent. No. I persisted in the habit when both 
lights possessed considerable intensity. No. II lost 
the habit when the angular opening on the stimulus was 
set at 20—30° (when the energy of the blue was 1/18— 
1/12 that of the yellow). The fact that the habit dis- 
appeared when the negative color bore 1/18—1/12 the 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  224 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
energy of the yellow furnishes almost conclusive evidence 
that supposition 2 above is correct: This animal was re- 
sponding on the basis of the difference in intensity, i.e., 
when both stimuli were present, positively to the more in- 
tense; as soon, however, as the negative stimulus possessed 
the same stimulating effect, the basis for response disap- 
peared. The results of the experiments on No. I cannot 
be interpreted except by the use of control tests. Without 
entering into the details of these it was found that the 
stimulating value of blue for this animal was very high and 
that in order to get. an equal stimulating effect from the 
yellow one must make its energy many times greater than 
that of the blue. When the stimuli were so manipulated 
that both possessed equal stimulating value, the habit 
disappeared for animal No. II just as it did for No. I. It 
was further shown that when the negative color was made 
to possess higher stimulating value than the positive, the 
response was reversed, i.e., the animal then reacted posi- 
tively to the light which it had formerly reacted against. 
The same condition obtained when a strong white light 
was presented in place of the color reacted against—the 
animal responded positively to the white light. Further- 
more the animals responded positively to the negative 
stimulus when it was given alone. The conclusion that 
the stimulus to which the animals were responding was an 
intensity difference, and that a difference in wave-length 
possessed no stimulating value, seems valid (at least so far 
as concerns the responses to yellow-blue). 
Analysis of the delayed reaction—On p. 105 we dis- 
cussed the method by means of which the delayed response 
is obtained. The situation in brief is as follows: while 
the animal is held in restraint its visual receptors are stimu- 
lated by a light which may appear in any one of three boxes, 
left, in front, or at the right. The animal has previously 
been trained to go to the lighted compartment for food. 
After training the animal is not released until after the 
light has been turned out. Upon release it must go to the 
box in which the light last appeared. The experimenter 
may, at will, allow an appreciable time to elapse between 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  ANALYSIS OF DELAYED REACTION 225 
turning out the light and releasing the animal. Let us 
glance at first at the maximum delay which can be obtained 
in different types of animals. Hunter has tested rats, dogs, 
raccoons, and children. We may observe his results more 
conveniently in the form of a table.

The problem here seemingly is to determine the mech- 
anism by means of which correct response may be made to 
a stimulus which is no longer present. We shall see later 
that this problem may be restated so as to bring it in line 
with the other types of response which can be explained in 
terms of the immediate functioning of neural ares. Prior 
to experimental analysis there appear to be several possi- 
bilities of sensory stimulation which might lead to success- 
ful response after the period of delay: (1) the experimenter 
himself might give the stimulus in one of several ways, such 
as shifting his position, changing the breathing, ete.; (2) 
the order in the tests might not have been sufficiently 
varied; (3) the box in which the light last appeared might 
have risen in temperature; (4) the increase in the tem- 
perature of the light box might have increased the diffusion 
of the gaseous particles which arouse the olfactory recep- 
tors;8 (5) the after-glow of the recently lighted lamp 
might have been responded to; (6) the after-images of 
the light might lead to response. These possibilities of 
sensory stimulation are not exhaustive. They are merely 
illustrative of the many which must be considered. We 
cannot take up in detail the various methods by means of 
which such possible stimuli were eliminated. In general 
they were found to be inoperative and the only extra- 
organic factor was the presence of the light in the box. 
Normal methods of elimination were used in reaching these 
results. 
On what basis, then, is it possible to react to the position 
18 Neither (3) nor (4) was sufficiently controlled by Hunter.
-P-A-G-E-240
  226 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
of a stimulus which was present for a time and then dis- 
appeared? Obviously one possibility of explanation lies in 
the fact that the light when present releases a definite 
set of arcs which function the one after the other, as in 
every habit. It is easy to see that the light itself forces 
into action a definite set of arcs, which result in bodily 
orientation, such as turning the head and body to the light, 
crouching, maintaining that attitude, and the inhibition of 
other movements. The movements initiated by the light in 
turn arouse kinesthetic and organic impulses which in 
turn inhibit movement, ete. The auditory and visual stimuli 
offered by releasing the animal immediately initiate the 
walking and the running movement. Since the animal is 
already oriented, naturally the movements take him to 
the box which was last lighted. Once there the habit of 
entering the box, eating the food, etc., is re-aroused. We 
might call this the first method by means of which the light 
could exert a determining effect although absent (i.e., 
through initiating the reflex ares which function continu- 
ously and serially from the moment the light is presented 
until the animal arrives at the food). 
In more highly organized subjects in which speech habits 
are adequate for all ordinary situations, the light may 
arouse a group of throat movements long since correlated 
with definite modes of response (e.g., the words ‘‘ go to 
the box in front when door opens ’’). With such a highly 
complex system of habits there is no need for the are origi- 
nally aroused continuously to exert its function as in the 
first case considered. The animal with speech habits may 
begin to play or engage in any number of activities with- 
out producing a breakdown in the response when the door 
is opened. At the moment of release the visual stimulus of 
the opening door re-arouses the vocal impulses which lead 
to their natural sequences, viz., movements straight forward 
to the box in front. We will call this method two. 
In the less highly organized animals the periods of delay 
are wholly determined by the length of time it can retain 
bodily orientation. This will depend upon its organization 
(i.e., sensitivity to forms of stimulus other than kinesthetic)
-P-A-G-E-241
    
ANALYSIS OF DELAYED REACTION 227 
and to the actual intensity of the sensory stimuli present 
(noises, changes in the light, bites of insects, ete.). 
Observation of the various animals seems to show that 
the rat, in order to respond correctly, must maintain actual 
gross bodily orientation. It cannot move about after the 
light is turned out. If this overt orientation is lost for a 
moment any one of the three boxes may be entered. This 
statement holds true for all of the correct responses of the 
rat and the dog, and for most of those of the raccoon. On 
the other hand, several of the responses of the raccoons 
and all of the responses of the children offered a mode 
of behavior which cannot be explained in the terms of main- 
tained bodily attitude. It is possible for the raccoons and 
the children to lose all bodily orientation and then to re- 
spond correctly when the door is opened. It is possible, 
also, in the case of the raccoons, to introduce loud noises, 
ete., without disturbing the response. The case of the long 
delays of the children may be explained by the use of the 
language habit (p. 328). The behavior of the raccoons can- 
not be explained in this way since language habits are not 
present.® There is no known mechanism of response which 
might account for this. It thus seems best to reserve our 
attempt at explanation. 
Summary.—A habit is thus seen to involve always. a 
series of definite arcs beginning in a receptor and ending 
in an effecter. In sensory habits we isolate and define the 
stimulus which will initiate the impulses in these ares. In 
motor habits by the interposing of certain conditions (set- 
ting of certain problems) we force upon the animal certain 
1° Both Carr and Hunter would insist that there are other possi- 
bilities of explanation, ie., that certain other proprio- and entero- 
ceptive processes might function in the same way that we have 
assumed that language habits function (ie., so that continuous 
bodily orientation is not necessary). Were Hunter a less careful 
investigator, we might think that there was an actual error in 
observation. Most of the raccoons were admittedly making the cor- 
rect reaction upon the basis of maintained bodily orientation. What 
more simple than to suppose that those animals which were not 
disturbed by loss of bodily orientation had learned to make correct 
response upon the basis of olfactory stimuli which were not suffi- 
ciently controlled in Hunter’s work? 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  228 STUDY OF HABIT FORMATION 
types of synthesis of action of the effectors, temporally 
space their action, note the rapidity of growth of the 
combination, etc. It must not be forgotten,:though, that 
even in motor habits the receptors are equally involved. 
If we examine such habits from this standpoint we find 
that: (1) all receptors may be involved in a given habit 
at every stage, ie., there may never be any complete reduc- 
tion to kinesthesis; (2) in some animals the learning of 
certain habits requires the codperation of all receptors, but 
the execution of these habits after learning requires the 
functioning mainly of the proprio-ceptors; (3) in other 
animals, both the learning and the final execution may be 
mediated by the proprio-ceptive system. 
VI. Efficiency of training methods: motor habits.—In 
the animal world we have a better opportunity for 
testing the various methods of training than we have in 
the schools, for the human child. The subject of efficiency 
as a whole has not yet received the attention which it 
deserves. Our records are fairly complete at least for one 
species of animal—the white rat—so far as his motor habits 
are concerned. The various questions to which we can re- 
turn answers may be stated as follows: (1) what number of. 
trials per day should be given an animal while it is ac- 
quiring one motor habit at a time, if our object is to secure 
a perfect habit with a minimum number of trials? (2) 
What is the effect upon the retention of the habit of this 
method as compared with a nethod which requires a 
larger number of trials? (3) Will the same method which 
has happened to serve the purpose of (1) serve equally as 
well when the animal is acquiring simultaneously more 
than one motor habit, e.g., three such habits? 
In order to test these questions, Ulrich (whose report is 
as yet unpublished) has made a three-years’ study upon 
the white rat. He allowed several groups of animals to 
learn box II, each group being given a different number 
of trials per day,?° all other conditions except the one

learned the problem after 11 trials; 2 after 13 trials, 3 
after 14, ete. All 16 of the animals had learned the prob- 
lems by the end of the twenty-fourth trial. If now we 
pass to Group II (Fig. 45, IL) we see that the first ani- 
mal learning the problem required 21 trials, while the last 
eat but sparingly. Food is then immediately given on the Second 
and succeeding trials. At the end of the daily allotment of trials, 
the animal is allowed to eat its full ration of food in the box,

animal required 36 trials. Similarly, in Group III (Fig. 
45, IIT) the first animal to learn the problem required 30 
trials; the last animal 50 trials. Group IV (Fig. 46, IV) 
gives 9 trials for the first animal to learn, and 22 for the

last. Group V (Fig. 46, V) showed that the first animal 
learned in 9 trials and the last in 17. 
We find in this experiment the answer to question (1) 
raised above. Within certain limits, which have not been 
determined yet, it is far more economical, so far as the 
number of trials is concerned, to give a few rather than a 
large number of trials per day. From the distribution 
curves it would seem that the one-in-three method is cer- 
tainly far more economical than the three-in-one or the 
five-in-one ; indeed, it seems the most advantageous method 
of all. As regards our second question, i.e., the effect of 
a different method on the retention of the habit, the re- 
sults seem to show that no one method has any distinct 
advantage over the others. The five-in-one method and 
the one-in-two method gave the poorest results. After 
each animal had been trained to the problem it was not 
tested again until after 60 days had elapsed. During the 
non-training period the animals were forced to run daily 
to the end of a long straight-away to obtain food. They 
were allowed to eat the same amount of food as during the 
training period. This method kept them in training (pre- 
vented the laying on of fat, the onset of sluggishness, 
wildness, ete.). At the end of 60 days each animal was tried

When we consider the number of days required to form 
the habit, we find an entirely different situation. The 
distribution curves by days are given on p. 229, Fig. 45. 
The curve of Group I is repeated (Fig. 45, C) for the 
sake of convenience. In plotting these curves the num- 
ber of days required to learn the problem replaced the 
number of trials in the early curves, e.g., in the graph 
showing the five-in-one method (Fig. 45, A) it will be 
seen that 3 animals required 6 days; 2, 7 days; 1, 8 
days; 3, 9 days; 2, 10 days. When all the curves have 
been considered it appears that within the limits of this 
experiment the larger number of trials given per day, the 
less the number of days required for learning. 
The third question raised above can be answered only by 
experimentation. Which of the above methods is most 
advantageous when three problems are learned abreast? 
Three groups of animals entirely different from those just 
discussed were allowed to learn simultaneously boxes II 
and III and maze I (pp. 95 and 100). 
Group I. 1 trial on box TI, then immediately 1 trial on maze I,

be compared with those on p. 229. Looking first at the num- 
ber of trials required to learn the problem we see (1) that 
by any of the methods the absolute number of trials re- 
quired to learn box II, when 2 other problems are learned 
simultaneously, is far greater than when box II is learned 
alone; (2) that the one-in-one method shows the greatest 
economy so far as the necessary trials are concerned when 
contrasted with the three-in-one and the five-in-one methods.

The above table on retention, constructed as the table on 
p. 231, shows clearly that the smaller the number of trials 
given per day when several problems are learned abreast, 
the better the retention. The absolute loss during the 60 
days non-practice period is greater when two problems are 
learned in conjunction with box II than when box II is 
learned alone. Again, when we compare the methods from 
the standpoint of days, we see that the situation is re- 
versed. The distribution curve (Fig. 47) shows again that 
within the limits of this experiment the larger the number 
of trials, the fewer the number of days required to learn. 
Sensory habits.—A corresponding series of experiments 
has been made on sensory habits. Tests upon the dancing 
mouse indicate that for the white-black discrimination, the 
fewer the tests per day, within the limits of 2 and 100, the 
higher the efficiency of the method of training, as measured” 
in terms of the total number of tests necessary for the 
establishment of a perfect habit, and the lower its efficiency 
as measured in terms of the number of series given. The 
table given below shows the total number of errors in each 
set of 10, trials for each of the four methods used.2!_ No 
21 Since sensory habits arise so very slowly, it can easily be seen 
that, in so far as the conservation of the experimenter’s time is 
concerned, it has been the custom to effect a compromise by giving 
10-20 trials per day. This is a purely practical matter and has no 
bearing upon the physiological problems involved in learning.

specific experiments have been made to test the efficiency 
of these methods upon retention, nor their effect when 
two or more sensory (or one sensory and one motor) habits 
are required simultaneously. 
The delayed reaction—Economy in learning the de- 
layed reaction has been tested only incidentally. The effect 
of giving 5 trials and 10 trials during the training period 
(i.e., establishing ordinary sensory habit) is shown in 
the following table taken from Hunter:

It is clearly indicated here that the use of 5 trials 
favored rapid learning more than did the use of 10 trials.
-P-A-G-E-249
  EFFECT OF AGE ON LEARNING 235 
No results are given for the effect on retention of the 
5-trial method as over against the 10-trial method. It 
appears, however, that the number of trials given per day 
in the preliminary training does not affect the interval 
of delay. 
VII. Other conditions which affect learning—Some 
of the factors which must be considered with reference to 
learning are (1) the age of the animal, (2) possibly sex, 
(3) certain general bodily conditions—starvation, arrested 
growth, etc., (4) relative brain weight as compared with 
body weight, and (5) removal of parts of nervous system. . 
Only a few of these have been considered with any degree 
of care; indeed, some have been left wholly untouched. 
(1) Age.—From some experiments carried out by the * 
author in 1902 he concluded that the young white rat forms 
motor habits, maze, box I, ete., much more rapidly than 
the adults. The young animals form the habit of manipu- 
lation much less rapidly than do the adults, the general 
conclusion being that any habit which requires for its 
learning excess running, climbing, ete., could be learned 
by any animal at the age of about 35 days more rapidly * 
than by the adult. On the other hand, those problems 
which depend for their solution upon control of move- , 
ment, can be learned by the adult more rapidly. This ~ 
conclusion was probably not based upon a sufficiently large 
number of tests. 
Since the above work was completed two other experi- 
ments bearing upon the same problem have been made. 
The first relates to sensory habits. In the dancing 
mouse Yerkes has established beyond question the fact 
that the dancer at 1 month of age can form a particular* 
black-white habit in a much less number of trials than can 
an older individual. From the first to the seventh month 
there is a steadily marked increase in the capacity to form 
habits of this character. From the seventh to the tenth 
month there is retrogression in this capacity. Further- 
more, it would seem that when the difference in intensity 
between the stimuli is slight, the young animals respond to 
it more readily than do the adults. When, however, the
-P-A-G-E-250
236 STUDY OF MABIT FORMATION 
difference is large, the old individuals respond as readily 
as the young (Weber law type of experiments). 
The other experiment referred to is that of Slonaker 
upon the activity of the white rat at different ages. It 
would seem from this work that the most active period in 
the life of the rat is at the age of (approximately) 100 
days. This was determined by allowing the animal to live 
in a cage which turned on a stationary axis each time the 
animal left the nest box to obtain water or food. It would 
thus seem that our early conclusions need confirmation. 
But it must be remembered that Yerkes worked upon a 
sensory habit and used punishment, whereas we worked 
upon a motor habit and without punishment. In regard 
to Slonaker’s work it may be stated that the period of 
greatest activity as obtained by his method need not at 
all coincide with the period of greatest activity of the 
kind involved in attacks upon problem boxes.** 
(2) Sex.—No very systematie studies have been made 
upon sex differences in learning. All through the litera- 
ture we find statements to the effect that possibly there 
was a sex difference, or that there was a slight difference, 
ete. No experiments which we consider crucial have been 
made which will enable us to state in what forms of be- 
havior sex differences appear. Personally, from long years 
of association with animal work, we are prepared to affirm 
our belief that there are differences everywhere between 
the males and the females, which may be seen clearly, as 
every one admits, during the periods of heat, in the female 
during pregnancy (or brooding, depending upon the 
pbyla). In regard to the differences in the methods of 
attack upon problems there may be subtle differences which 
are very difficult to bring under experimental control. 
Yerkes has come out rather definitely in his statements con- 
cerning the sex differences in the dancing mouse. He states, 
on the basis of several experiments, that the young males 
72 Miss Hubbert is making a thorough study of the effect of age 
upon the formation of maze habits in rats, using the maze with a 
camera lucida attachment, by means of which the movements may 
be recorded during the learning process.
-P-A-G-E-251
  
LEARNING IN DEFECTIVE ANIMALS — 237 
acquire the habit of discrimination (black-white) more 
quickly than do the females, but that between the ages of 
4 to 10 months the females acquire the habit more quickly ; 
and that the female makes more mistakes early in training 
tests than the male, but that this condition gives place 
soon to greater accuracy of response on the part of the fe- 
male. This author remarks incidentally that the male 
dancer is somewhat more sensitive to punishment than is 
the female. Also, in his book on the dancing mouse, he 
states that the labyrinth habit (labyrinth C) was acquired 
by the female more quickly than by the male. 
(3) Certain bodily conditions.—No definite experiments 
have yet been published upon the effects of starvation. 
From some unpublished experiments at the Wistar Institute 
of Anatomy it would appear that rats which had been 
stunted by underfeeding and then returned to a normal 
diet learned more rapidly than normal animals.** 
Through the work of Osborne and Mendel it has been 
found possible to hold body growth in statu quo and then 
later to accelerate it at will. This method of controlling 
growth offers interesting possibilities in the study of habit 
formation. 
(4) Learning in animals with less than normal brain 
weights.—Basset has carried out an extensive piece of work 
upon a strain of rats the brain weight of which was: far 
below normal. This strain of rats (Mus noregicus albinus) « 
was obtained from the Wistar Institute of Anatomy. The 
strain was strictly inbred for 6 or 7 generations. Through 
the effects of inbreeding, or some other cause (starting with 
a mutant in which the relative brain weight was small, ete.) 
not yet determined, this strain of rats had, relatively to the 
body length, a much smaller brain weight than the normal 
rat. The following curve (Fig. 48) shows the distribution 
of brain weights of the normal and inbred rats actually 
used in Basset’s work. It will be seen that the inbred curve 
shows the greatest frequency at .88%; the normal curve at 
28 The experiments were made by Dr. J. W. Hayes. See also the 
report of Langfeld, “ Psychophysiological Tests During Prolonged

92%. The inbred distribution is from .70¢ to .95¢; that of 
the normals, from .84% to 1.05%. The average relative brain 
weight with respect to body length of the 62 normal animals 
is .93351%; and that of the inbreds, .87335¢, or 6.44¢ less 
than that of the normals. Basset then tested 62 of the nor-

mal animals and 62 of the animals with the small brain 
weight (inbreds) with respect to the rapidity with which 
they acquire the maze habit and that of the inclined plane. 
It appears that the animals with the lesser brain weight re- 
quire on the average a larger number of days to learn these 
two problems. Furthermore, the time for relearning was 
far greater in the case of the inbreds than in that of the 
normals (see p. 246). 
(5) Motor habits in animals with parts of the nervous 
system removed.—It has been shown (Franz) in both 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  EFFECT OF PREVIOUS TRAINING 239 
monkeys and cats that newly formed motor habits (prob- 
lem boxes) (1) are lost if a bilateral lesion in the frontal 
Icbes is made. (2) Unilateral lesions produce only a 
slowing in the performance of the acts. (3) Habits once 
lost after the removal of the frontal lobes may be regained 
through training. (4) Habits of long standing are not lost 
when such lesions are made. It would seem from these 
experiments that the arcs involved in the acquisition of 
motor habits usually, but not necessarily, embrace the 
frontal lobes. From certain recent experiments we are led 
to believe that the decerebrate frog is incapable of forming 
habits. The use of operative technique in the study of sen- 
sory habits is discussed on p. 209 and its use in the study 
of localization of brain function (sensory projection cen- 
ters) on p. 376. 
VIII. Effect of previous habits upon the formation of 
new habits: motor habits.—Neither in the study of human 
habits nor in that of animal habits have there been thor- 
ough systematic attempts to bring the mutual relations of 
habits under control nor to test the effect of previous train- 
ing upon the formation of new habits. There is an enormous 
field of work here which has just been touched upon. Re- 
search work would yield very rapid results and of such a 
kind as to be of very great importance in the study of 
human training methods. We are able to cite in the animal 
world the following particulars concerning the influence of 
previous habits upon the formation of new habits: the danc- 
ing mouse not previously trained on a simple labyrinth (C) 
makes the first correct trip on an average at the end of 
19.7 trials. On the other hand, animals previously trained 
in another labyrinth (B) will make a successful trip in this 
labyrinth (C) on the 7th trial. Mastery of B by untrained 
animals requires 8.2 trials; by those previously trained on 
© (a rather difficult maze), 5 trials. (Yerkes: ‘‘ Dancing 
Mouse.’’) Similar results have been obtained with the 
white rat. Fig. 49 shows the curve of untrained rats on 
box III and of trained (by previously learning boxes I 
and II) rats in learning the same problem. The differ- 
ence between the two curves is quite marked. Different

spect (Richardson). In testing untrained pigeons on a

Fic. 49. Snowine the Errecr or Previous TRAINING IN ACQUIRING 
New Hasirs (From Richardson, Psych. Mons., Serial No. 48.) 
trained on another maze, it was found that the untrained 
animals learned in as few trials as the trained. Further- 
more, the excess time and errors during the early trials are 
greater for the trained than for the untrained. Excess 
effort, however, is eliminated more rapidly (in a less num-
-P-A-G-E-255
  EFFECT OF PREVIOUS TRAINING 241 
ber of trials) in the case of the trained than the untrained. 
It would seem that the early habits acquired by the trained 
group persisted in the new work and interfered with the 
formation of another habit (Hunter).?* That interference 
of this kind may exist comes out still more clearly in work 
on the squirrels. It was found that squirrels trained to 
open box I and box II are at a disadvantage as compared 
with untrained animals when they come to learn box III. 
Boxes I and II require scraping, butting up of the latch 
with the nose, ete. These acts were carried over to box 
III; consequently the animals lost time in trying to open 
box III by persisting in movements organized to meet other 
conditions (Yoakum). It seems evident, although the 
above results do not wholly justify the view, that the type 
of results we shall get in such eases is dependent upon 
the similarity between the old habit and the habit we 
desire to instil; certainly also upon the differences in the 
use of receptors,—an animal in which position habits arise 
easily is very likely to carry these over into a new situa- 
tion, whereas an animal with keen vision will likely be 
attracted by the visual stimuli in the new situation, ete. 
It will be recalled that the problem under discussion is 
similar to that involved in the question of specific vs. gen- 
eral training. However, in the case of animals we shall not 
rest content in settling the matter by argumentation. We 
shall try to build up by experimentation a series of facts 
which will show the reciprocal effects of one motor habit 
upon another; or motor habits upon sensory, or vice versa; 
or sensory habits upon sensory, ete., and to analyze these 
facts in terms of the organization of reflex are systems. 
IX. Retention.—The term ‘‘ memory ”’ has been ill- 
advisedly used in the experiments upon the effect of inter- 
vals of disuse upon habit functions. The term ‘“ reten- 
24 By interference nothing mysterious is meant. We mean nothing 
more than that old habits persisted in the new work. Consequently 
the group of random movements released by the new stimulus did 
not contain in it the successful movement. Not until the old habits 
had been exercised continuously but unavailingly, with resulting 
fatigue, did the stimulus call out the new group, which contained 
the needed movement.
-P-A-G-E-256
  242 STUDY OF ITABIT FORMATION 
tion ’’ has been employed in a static sense in this same 
connection, referring chiefly to the ‘‘ persistence of modi- 
fications ’’ in the nervous system.2> Both terms are ill- 
defined. It seems possible to keep the term retention and 
make its meaning more definite. In behavior the term re- 
tention covers this phenomenon; viz., that an object to 
which an animal has learned to respond in a definite way 
will for a more or less definite period in which the given 
response has been. prevented (i.e., by not presenting the 
object) call forth in various degrees of perfection the old 
(or habitual) response. If the response is as , definite 
at the end of the period of disuse as before we say that 
there has been no loss in retention or that retention was 
perfect. In most cases the response, after a period of 
disuse, is not perfect (i., there is excess effort). The 
effect of the period of disuse can be measured (in terms 
of time, distance, errors, ete.) by comparing the first trial 
after disuse with the last trial before disuse; or other- 
wise expressed, the last trial Z of regular training with 
the first trial a of retraining. If a certain length of time 
is overstepped the excess effort of trial a may be as great 
as that of A, the first trial in’the training series. In this 
ease the habit appears to be lost. Only complete retraining 
will tell us whether this is really the case. If the retraining 
series requires the same number of trials and the same 
amount of excess effort as the regular training series, the 
2° The neural picture, both during the formation of a habit and 
during the period of non-practice, has been interestingly presented 
by William James. Since his Principles appeared we have described 
habit by saying that the neural impulse aroused by the given stimulus 
in some way digs an ever-deeper trench for itself, and that it in 
some way modifies the conduction system (molecular rearrange- 
ment) over which it passes. Accordingly we would speak of path- 
ways in the nervous system and of their modifications. We would 
further assume that such modifications persist for definite intervals 
of time, possibly never wholly disappearing. So far as we know 
there is no longer any justification for assuming that a neural im- 
pulse, which is probably electrical, in any way modifies permanently 
the conductor over which it passes. While we are ignorant yet of 
what happens at the surfaces of separation of the conduction systems 
as regards permeability and the reverse, it seems quite unlikely that 
neuro-physiology will ever discover any structural modifications in 
the conductors themselves.
-P-A-G-E-257
  RETENTION 243 
evidence is clear that the habit was really lost. Behavior 
has not fixed upon definite methods of making retention 
tests. Shall we compare only the last trial of the train- 
ing series with the first trial of retraining? Or shall we 
average the last three trials of training with the first three 
trials of retraining? Or shall we carry out a wholly new 
retraining series? In retraining this rather interesting 
question comes up. It often happens that in the training 
series we use different methods for the different groups, 
as we saw in section VII, where the number of trials 
given per day differed in the different groups. Now, in 
the retraining series shall we use a common method for 
all the animals, or shall we retrain with a method identi- 
cal with that of training? Furthermore, during the period 
of disuse some systematic method of caring for the animals 
should be adopted. In most retention tests we read that 
at the end of the training series the animals were put away 
until the time for the retention test. No effort is ever made 
to keep the animals in the ‘‘ problem solving condition.”’ 
It is quite obvious that retention tests made under such 
uncontrolled conditions are worthless from the standpoint 
of testing pure retentiveness and for purposes of compari- 
son. In the tests which Ulrich and Basset made in the 
Hopkins Laboratory they adopted the following technique: 
A long run-way was constructed at the end of which food 
was placed. At the close of the training period the animal 
was forced each day at feeding time to travel to the end of 
the run-way in order to get food. By this method the ani- 
mal was kept in condition. The amount of food taken 
was also controlled, i.e., kept constant as in the training 
period (the animal eating for a certain definite time). Fur- 
thermore, the animal was kept from becoming wild and 
from putting on fat. We suggest the following as a pos- 
sible standard of procedure. Some standard of accuracy 
of mastery must be adopted. This will necessarily differ 
even upon the same problem with the different species of 
animal used. ‘This standard, where. possible, should be 
based upon more than one criterion. Time is the best single 
criterion in motor habits. The time allowed for a trial 
 
-P-A-G-E-258

must be determined previously by averaging the results 
of at least 30 animals which: have learned the problem 
just to the point where no errors appear and no excess 
distance is traversed. (Such records are gradually collected 
on all pieces of apparatus in general use in the laboratory.) 
Distance traversed, where it can be measured accurately 
(as in the maze, p. 100), is probably the next best criterion. 
Any distance greater than the measured shortest route is 
““ excess.’? Mastery of the problem regardless of the time 
cannot be said to have been attained until there is no excess 
distance. Freedom from-+error for 30 consecutive trials 
has been Yerkes’ criterion of mastery for sensory habits. 
This appears to work well enough. After the animal has 
mastered the problem it should be worked with and fed 
each day by forcing it to go for food to the end of a long 
run-way. It should be allowed to eat the full amount of 
food that the experimenter knows to be necessary in order 
to maintain metabolism. The animal should have been 
made familiar with this method of obtaining food before 
even the training period is begun. Furthermore, since 
neither in work upon motor habits nor in that on sensory 
habits are the animals usually allowed to eat their full 
quota of food in the experimental room, they should be 
fed the remainder in this run-way. At the end of the 
period of disuse retraining should begin. The fairest way 
seems to be to retrain all animals by the same method re- 
gardless of the training method. Furthermore, we suggest 
that one trial per day only be given in motor habits and that 
10 trials per day be given in sensory habits. Retraining 
should be carried to the point of original mastery. The 
last trial of training should be separately compared with 
the first trial of retraining. The whole of the retraining 
series should then be averaged by successive trials and 
plotted (i.e., without telescoping and then averaging). It 
must be remembered that only the first trial appears 
“pure.’’? Practice effects appear immediately. 
In regard to the concrete data upon retention it must 
be confessed that there is not a single research in the whole 
field which throws particular emphasis upon retention.

What results we have have been made incidentally in con- 
nection with studies on habit formation. Since no approach 
to uniformity in the method of making tests on retention 
has been observed by the different experimenters, we can do 
little more than summarize their findings. 
Mammals.—Yerkes shows that in the dancer a perfectly

The solid line ( ) is the error curve of the original learning 
process; the broken line (- - - -) is that of the relearning process, 
after an interval of 8 weeks. (After Yerkes, The Dancing Mouse, 
Maemillan, New York, 1907, p. 257.)

weeks at least. The results for 4-week intervals show ex- 
treme individual differences in retention. In the case of 2 
animals retention tests were made after 3 different rest 
intervals. . At the end of 2 weeks the habit was present in 
both individuals. After 6 and 4 weeks respectively it still 
persisted and was apparently improved as the result of ad- 
ditional training received at the end of the 2-weeks period. 
At the expiration of 10 weeks it had apparently disappeared.

than they had originally acquired it. Pages 231 and 233 
present the two tables from Ulrich’s work upon rats. Bas- 
set (p. 237), whose general method of testing retention was 
the same as that of Ulrich, states that normal animals after 
a 60-day rest required 5.76 days to relearn the circular 
maze (p. 100), whereas the animal with lesser brain weight 
required 12.6 days. The final time for traversing the maze 
on the training series was, for both normals and inbreds, 6 
_ seconds. After the 60-day rest the average of the first trial 
for the inbreds was 31.8 seconds, for the normals 22.5 sec- 
onds. The normals required 4.68 to relearn the latch box, 
whereas the animals with lesser brain weight required 6.74 
days. The final time for solving the problem on the training 
series was 4 seconds for both normals and inbreds: after 60 
days the average time of first trial for inbreds was 81.5 sec- 
onds, for the normals 59.6 seconds. Allen shows that the 
guinea pig retains a very simple labyrinth without great loss 
for at least 63 days. The retention of the habit was almost 
perfect. The time for the first success of this animal was 1 
minute. Sackett says that the Canadian porcupine re- 
tains the Hampton Court maze with some loss for 
a 10-day period. Its whole time on the trial for reten- 
tion was 6 minutes and 30 seconds; its second retentive 
test was 1 minute and 5 seconds. The final time of the 
training series was 1 minute and 10 seconds. The test of 
the retention of fastenings showed that at 13 days there 
was no loss; while at 30 days there had been a slight loss 
which could be regained at the end of 1 trial; at 50 days 
there was almost a complete loss. Davis states that the 
raccoon’s retention of simple fastenings remains practically 
undiminished for periods of no practice of more than a year. 
In the case of the combination lock (p. 99) the retention 
was imperfect after a period of 286 days, but the relearn- 
ing was rapid, only 24 trials being necessary to gain the 
facility that originally required 107 trials. Cole states 
that the memory for a combination of 7 fastenings was not 
perfect at the end of 147 days in the raccoon. Three ani- 
mals were tested on this box after that period of no practice. 
Only the first succeeded in working all of the fastenings

and releasing himself; he undid the 7 fastenings and came 
out of the box in 34, 28, 131, and 182 seconds respectively. 
The other animals worked almost all of them but failed to 
complete the work. <A cat tested by Thorndike on a simple 
puzzle box showed a perfect response at the end of 20 days. 
Another cat which opened this box at the end of the train- 
ing series in 8 seconds, opened the box 14 days later in 
3, 9, and 8 seconds respectively in three trials. Colvin and 
Burford state that the dog retained the habit of reacting to 
standard color for 3 weeks without loss. In the squirrel 1 
month’s suspension of time brought considerable loss in the 
accuracy of the same kind of habit.*° The following table

Thorndike shows that habits of manipulation in the mon- 
key suffer little loss after periods ranging from 67 to 240 
days. 
Birds.—Hunter states that the retention of the pigeon 
for a simple labyrinth is practically perfect for 4 weeks 
where there has been no intervening training whatsoever. 
The pigeon would thus seem to be somewhat superior to the 
cowbirds and sparrows tested by Porter. Rouse mentions 
incidentally that associations in the pigeon are fairly per- 
manent and remain practically unaltered for at least 6 
weeks. There are no records of tests which would suffi- 
ciently establish this point. Porter states that the English 
26 Johnson gives a rough statement on the retention of habits of 
manipulation in dogs (blind and normal). The loss in accuracy (in 
simple problem boxes) at the end of 60 days was only about 10%. 
 
-P-A-G-E-262

sparrow did not show any loss of skill in opening a simple 
food box after an interval of 8 days. He further states 
that the retention of a simple maze is surprisingly good for 
birds at the end of 30 days. The cowbird stands first. 
Her average for the first 10 trials in retraining equals 
that of the last 10 of the initial training. The vesper 
sparrow and the female English sparrow do not do quite 
so well. Retention of simple fastenings after 30 days by 
the cowbird and pigeon shows some loss; the male pigeon 
showed less loss than the cowbird. The female pigeon 
and the cowbird lapsed into a poor method which was 
used early in the training series. At the end of 120 
days the cowbird and the pigeon were again tested upon the 
simple fastenings. While the loss was considerable the 
habit was not completely lost and was readily reacquired. 
Thorndike retested chicks on a simple labyrinth at the end 
of 20 days and found that retention was practically per- 
fect. Breed shows that of 9 chicks trained to the black- 
blue habit and tested 30 days later, 5 obtained perfect 
records. Breed presents evidence to show, too, that chicks 
which acquire the, black-blue habit most readily also show 
the most perfect persistence tests. Thus of 3 animals that 
required 100 trials to perfect the black-blue modification 
1 made perfect persistence tests; of the 2 that required 
70 trials 1 made a perfect record; of 3 that required 60 
trials, 2 made perfect records; and the chick that com- 
pleted its work in the shortest time also made a perfect 
record. 
Amphibia and reptiles—Yerkes shows that the green 
frog retains a simple labyrinth habit for at least 30 days. 
Casteel states that the turtle (Chrysemys marginata) re- 
tains a simple sensory habit—vertical vs. horizontal line— 
for 2 weeks without loss.

FIXATION OF ARCS IN HABIT* 
Introduction.—Historical outline.—Misconceptions and illogical pre- 
suppositions.—Enumeration of some of the problems.—Factors 
involved in fixation—Application of the principle of frequency 
in motor habits.+Justification for the use of the principle— 
Application of the principle of recency in motor habits——Sensory 
habits.—Substitution.—Repetition of movement in absence of 
original stimulus.—Conclusions. 
Introduction.—We found in the preceding chapter that 
the most insistent question in the study of habit was one 
that dealt with the mechanisms by means of which useless 
movements are eliminated. It follows from our previous 
discussions that we must be able to account for the elimina- 
tion of useless movements upon purely objective grounds. 
Historical outline——The psychological literature shows 
that the problem under discussion has always been the béte 
notre of the parallelist. He avoids it altogether or else 
goes over either into surreptitiously worded or more out- 
spoken form of interaction. All through the literature we 
find such statements as the ‘‘ conscious ’’ guidance or ‘‘ con- 
scious ’’ control of movements, the effect of having a plan 
or purpose in mind in learning, ete. In the experimental 
literature we find the frank statement that all improvement 
and short cuts in learning come unconsciously: when, how- 
ever, they have thus accidentally appeared, consciousness 
steps in and selects them purposely. Consciousness is looked 
upon as exerting a positive influence upon the bodily mech- 
+In the preparation of this chapter the author has had access to 
a manuscript of Professor Harvey A. Carr, entitled “ Principles of 
Selection in Animal Learning.’ This paper appears in the May 
number of the Psychological Review (1914). While the views ex- 
pressed in the present chapter are in many particulars different 
from those found in the above paper, we wish to call attention to 
Professor Carr’s prior claims in the matter of authorship.

anism. If a physiologist comes out and frankly admits 
that he is willing to accept interactionism, as Colvin does,? 
we should not wish to quarrel with him for applying that 
principle in solving the problem under consideration. 
Whether he has a right to apply it anywhere depends upon 
many questions which we have no right to enter upon here. 
But most of them are not willing to accept interaction in 
this frank way. The most outspokenly worded form ap- 
pears from psychologists who speak of the pleasure result- 
ing from a successful movement as stamping an act in, 
and the displeasure resulting from an unsuccessful act 
as stamping it out. In order to bring these tendencies 
clearly before us, we give below the views of a few psycholo- 
gists. 
' Statements from various authors: * 
Jupp states that “the mechanism involved in a habit which has 
resulted from selecting from among instincts is relatively easy to 
explain. We need only to assume that the stimulation which is 
given at the first experience has two theoretically possible lines of 
discharge, either one of which would be through a well-defined 
instinctive tract. The conditions of the first encounter carry the 
stimulation in question into one of the two instinctive channels and 
thereafter this selected channel becomes the natural and easy path 
of discharge for the stimulus whenever it occurs.” (p. 218) 
“Turning now from the habits which are developed through the 
selection and modification of instincts, we come to the habits which 
cannot properly be traced to any single instinct or group of instincts. 
Let us suppose that a stimulus or a combination of stimulations is 
introduced into the nervous system of the child but finds no specific 
channel of discharge open to it through inherited organization.” 
Judd insists that the stimulus “ will be widely distributed through 
the whole nervous system because it has no specific channel of dis- 
charge and because, as free energy, it must be transmitted through 
the nervous system until it finds a discharge into the active organs.” 
He cites the diffuse distribution in mature life when one is startled 
by an unexpected noise. As a case of habit formation with “little 
or no instinctive background” he describes the method the child 
employs in learning to write. Once again he states (p. 222): 
. . The nervous impulses which excite the muscles do not follow 
definite channels. In the ease now under consideration the channels 
are not yet developed . .” The mechanism by means of which 
the diffuse activity is molded into more definite form is described as 
follows: “. . . There is a tendency for all parts of the nervous 
? The Learning Process, p. xxii. 
* Italics ours except where noted.  
-P-A-G-E-267
  HISTORICAL SUMMARY 253 
system which are active at the same time to become related to one 
another in their activity; and . . . there is always a process of 
selection going forward by which those combinations which attain the 
end toward which the individual is working are preserved and the 
others eliminated.‘ The first of these two principles is not difficult 
to understand when the close structural and functional interrelations 
of the various parts of the nervous system are recalled. The second 
principle is much more difficult to explain. This principle may be 
restated in the following terms: If an animal goes through a certain 
mode of activity and derives advantage® from the success which 
attends this performance, it is likely to repeat the activity; whereas, 
if ‘the activity does not attain success, the animal will not repeat 
it.” 
ANGELL’s statements of the general problem, while seemingly clear, 
on analysis are found to be very hard to state in mechanical terms. 
He takes the formation of the eye-hand coérdination—the child 
learning to reach and manipulate a ball. He too starts with the 
idea of “diffusion” of nervous impulses. “. . . There are few or 
no preformed reflex pathways over which such neural excitement may 
be effectively discharged.” In the exercise of these diffuse acts the 
child’s hand comes in contact with the ball. What happens? “To 
begin with the mere shock of surprise and (generally) pleasure makes 
the connection of tactual motor sensations from his hand with the 
visual sensations from his eye extremely vivid.” . . . “We may 
be sure that the child’s organism is extremely likely to retain the 
memory of the highly vivid connection between the visual sensations 
of the ball and these tactual-motor feelings which accompanied the 
successful grasping of it.” . . . “If the nervous system were an 
inanimate mass, we might liken that which occurs to the process by 
which a path is made across a meadow. The first wayfarer may have 
selected his special route for any cause whatsoever, and his course 
may have been devious, like those of the cows which are said to have 
laid out the streets of Boston. But he has left a mark in the down- 
trodden grass which the next person to cross the field is likely to 
follow. Presently the grass is wholly worn away, and thereafter 
every one follows the beaten path.” He does not accept the metaphor 
whole-heartedly, however. “ But the moment we recall the fact that 
the nervous system is part of a living organism, in which processes 
of nutrition and repair are constantly going forward, and when we 
remember, furthermore, that the organism itself can in large measure 
decide whether a stimulus shall be experienced again and whether a 
movement shall be repeated or not, we. see that the metaphor of the 
pathway in the meadow must be abandoned in favor of some idea in 
which the vital processes of the organism are recognized and the 
living tissues treated as something other than so much static, plastic 
clay, which the accidents of the external world can mold to their 
own exclusive purposes.” . . . “ But the point which we must em- 
phasize is that the organism itself largely decides which pathways 
41.e., he frankly assumes the very thing for which we are trying to 
provide a mechanism. 
5To be found on p. 223. I.e., those acts are selected from which the 
animal derives advantage. Yet on p. 225 he has a paragraph heading 
* Pleasure a result of organization, not a cause.”

shall in the first instance become thus established.” He goes on to 
say that such multitudinous connections are possible, “that if the 
child were left to the accidents of the first external stimulations and 
to the vagaries of merely passive nervous centers, the chances would 
favor the acquirement of insane and harmful habits of reaction.” ° 
Angell gives no more definite account of the mechanism of habit for- 
mation than the above. In the paragraph on the inhibition of use- 
less movements he states: “The more firmly the connection becomes 
established, and the more deeply the pathway is cut between the 
visual sensory centers and the hand-arm motor centers, the more do 
the irrelevant movements of face, legs, and body tend to drop away! ” 
This inhibition is largely due to the fact that the newly formed 
channel is increasingly able to carry off all the neural excitation 
and in consequence less remains to overflow into other channels. 
PiILtspuRY makes voluminous reference to the nervous system but 
makes no effort to apply the theory of synaptical connection in detail. 
He states that Sherrington believes “ . . . that the synapse opposes 
the passage of an excitation in much the same way that a membrane 
opposes the transfer of fluids. At first this resistance is very great, 
but it is lessened with each act.” . . . “The change that comes 
with action is a lessened resistance at the synapses, whether it be 
due to the coming closer of the processes or to a chemical change 
that makes more permeable the relatively impermeable membrane 
that at first separates the neurones.” He then likens the synapse to 
a valve: “ At first the valves are stiff and open only to strong cur- 
rents; with use they work more easily.” . . . “At the beginning 
certain of the neurones constitute a path for an impulse from sense- 
organs to muscles. These original paths are few and make possible 
only the most essential activities for the continuance of the life of 
the individual. Additional paths of connection are formed by each 
activity, physical and mental. Whenever any two neurones chance 
to act together a connection is formed between them, the original 
gap is bridged and they come to form part of a new pathway 
from sense-organ to muscle. Sometimes the most important of the 
neurones that are connected lie within the cortex, and the learning 
that results is primarily learning of ideas rather than of movements, 
but the principle is the same as before. Learning, whether of new 
movements or of new ideas, is a process of making easier the passage 
of an impulse from neurone to neurone and is fundamentally the 
same everywhere.” Again on p. 55: “If we turn from a discussion 
of the omnipresence of habit to the question of what goes on in the 
nervous system when a habit is acquired, we get back to our problem 
of the synapse and its relations. Each time an act is performed, it 
matters not how, there is some change in the synapses between 
neurones. The effect of the act persists and becomes stronger with 
each repetition. After several repetitions the connection between 
the cells becomes so close that whenever the particular sensory cell 
is excited the impulse spreads to the motor cells that were active 
®Surely this vitalistic terminology is not insisted upon by Professor 
Angell. He would admit doubtless that were it not for the parents or other 
attendants the child would speedily destroy itself and that it is these 
same attendants that force the habits which enable it to exist when removed from the society of adults.

before, and the neurones grow more and more to constitute what is 
practically a single structure. The formation of habits is thus a 
process of decreasing the resistance of the. synapses in the different 
possible paths of transmission.” 
Boox’s statements are contradictory and unclear. On p. 95 he 
says: “ . . . All adaptations and short cuts in method were uncon- 
sciously made, i.e., fallen into by the learners quite unintentionally 
on the good days while practising under strain. The learners sud- 
denly learned that they were doing parts of the work in a new and 
better way, then purposely adopted it in the future.” On p. 171 he 
makes the following statement after first reiterating the unintention- 
ality and unconscious character of short cuts: ‘“ When the advantage 
of the new method had been noticed it was generally, thereafter, made 
use of purposely, though even there consciousness seemed to be more 
of a hindrance than a direct help.” In general he speaks of “ extreme 
effort carefully applied to the work on a good day” as being the 
precondition to a forward step. “ Fluctuations in attention and 
effort ” are the factors invoked to explain large variations, lack of 
improvement, ete., No effort is made by Book to analyze the condi- 
tion which makes it possible for the short cuts to be fixed. He 
speaks in several places somewhat as follows: “ Continued attention 
or application is assured by the pleasurable feelings and favorable 
attitude which always accompany success. The organism as a whole 
naturally tends to continue the activity as long as improvement is 
made. When progress stops the activity (mental and physical) be- 
comes disagreeable and attention goes elsewhere.” 
Similar confusion occurs in Swirr’s statements (p. 184): “It 
is interesting that all the subjects improved by hitting upon better 
ways of working without any further conscious selection. ‘There 
seems to be a competition of methods. Just how this selection occurs 
without conscious interference is not easy to say. Consciousness dis- 
covers modes of action already in use, and selects some of them for 
survival because of their success.” While it is obvious that if any 
one has such a vitalistic principle as this within him he needs no 
physiological mechanism to account for selection, yet nevertheless on 
p- 185 we find the following: “The question then arises, how are 
the necessary codrdinations brought about? It does not seem difficult 
to bring the matter into line with phenomena already pretty well 
known. Let us suppose a successful toss and catch are made. This 
is followed by a double effect: it leaves, as every action does, a trace 
in the nervous system which facilitates later repetition of the same 
action, and the successful adaptation also gives rise to a feeling of 
pleasure. The effect of pleasurable sensation is a heightening of 
muscular tonicity or a general tendency to muscular discharge, which 
in the case of an action just performed—one whose neural effects 
are still lingering—is equivalent to a partial reinnervation of the 
same codrdinated group of muscles, which again deepens the existing 
trace. The next actual effort finds the nervous mechanism a little 
readier to react in this favorable way. In case of an effort that 
does not lead to success, the slight displeasure at failure exerts its 
natural depressant effect upon the whole neuro-muscular system, and 
thus does not deepen the neural trace left by the original movement, 
and even, perhaps, breaks up the incipient codrdinations that gave it
-P-A-G-E-270
  256 FIXATION OF ARCS IN HABIT 
its particular form. In any case, whatever its mode of action, it has 
not the reinvigorating effect upon the original neural trace exercised 
by the pleasurable sensation. In the long run, therefore, the success- 
ful movements, and the ¢odrdinations upon which they depend, tend 
to persist, while those that are unsuccessful tend to fall away.” 
THORNDIKE in his earlier monograph speaks in a highly figurative 
way of pleasure stamping in an act and displeasure stamping it out. 
In his book (Animal Intelligence, p. 244) the two laws of learning 
are stated as follows: 
“The law of effect is that: Of several responses made to the same 
situation, those which are accompanied or closely followed by satis- 
faction to the animal will, other things being equal, be more firmly 
connected with the situation, so that, when it recurs, they will be 
more likely to recur; those which are accompanied or closely followed 
by discomfort to the animal will, other things being equal, have their 
connections with that situation weakened, so that, when it recurs, 
they will be less likely to occur. The greater the satisfaction or dis- 
comfort, the greater the strengthening or weakening of the bond.* 
“The law of exercise is that: Any response to a situation will, 
other things being equal, be more strongly connected with the situa- 
tion in proportion to the number of times it has been connected with 
that situation and to the average vigor and duration of the connec- 
tions.” * 
Misconceptions and illogical presuppositions.—It would 
seem that there must be something radically wrong with the 
statement of the empirical facts, since it seems so hard 
to arrive at even a satisfactory theoretical solution of our 
problems. Examination shows that three misconceptions 
have crept into the situation: (1) It has been assumed 
without further ado that the successful act is pleasant, and 
that the unsuccessful act is unpleasant. Without attempt- 
ing to venture into the realm of introspection, we shall 
advance some slight evidence to show that unsuccessful 
acts can be eliminated in cases where every movement in 
the situation as a whole is one which is ordinarily avoided 
by the animal. In Glaser’s experiment, where rats were 
dropped into hot or cold water and allowed to find an en- 
trance, it was shown that the animal formed the habit of 
TIt is obvious that the first law is no law at all, if by law we mean 
a generalization from a large set of empirical data. It is merely a state- 
ment of conviction. Furthermore, he calls it a law of effect, whereas it 
is obvious that it is a law of cause if it is supposed to be a statement 
of the working of the mechanism of fixation, as the second law un- 
doubtedly is. In regard to the second law it is clear that when this is 
stripped of its unnecessary implications of bonds or connections it is 
the same principle we have adopted on p. 262.

CERTAIN MISCONCEPTIONS 257 
turning correctly in the hot or cold water and finally reach- 
ing the exit. Suppose, e.g., we complicate the situation 
even further in the following way: instead’ of having an 
open vessel filled with water in which the animal can turn 
at will, we arrange partitions in the water, which the ani- 
mals may not clamber up, in the form of culs de sac. 
Furthermore, the exit from the maze as a whole should 
lead into a chamber which is hot but not hot enough to 
injure the tissue. The rat would ordinarily avoid the 
water, would ordinarily avoid the hot box, ete. It is ex- 
tremely probable that the habit would still be formed. 
The animal is so constructed that it must move when 
dropped into the water. If it moved at all, it would neces- 
sarily move so that certain acts would occur in accordance 
with the principles we have assumed to be adequate to 
account for habit formation (p. 262). It is our aim to com- 
bat the idea that pleasure or pain has anything to do with 
habit formation or that harmfulness or harmlessness has 
anything more to do with the situation. It is perfectly 
natural in unreflective minds that the idea of good or bad 
or harmful or harmless should be called in to explain the 
habits we force upon animals and children. It is a bit 
strange that scientifically minded men should have em- 
ployed it in an explanatory way. It unquestionably is a 
fact that the animals do respond positively to certain forms 
of stimuli and negatively to others, and that in the long 
run, all things considered, a race of animals has positive 
tendencies for those stimuli which are harmless to the tis- 
sue and negative ones for those which are harmful to the 
tissue. There is a perfectly good reason for this in heredity, 
viz., those mutants which survived must have had those 
tendencies to have escaped elimination. One only has to 
look at the tendencies of young children and those of young 
animals to see that there are hundreds of misplaced positive 
and negative tendencies. The child responds positively to 
a pretty reptile, harmful fluids, fire, swiftly moving but 
dangerous machinery, etc. Young animals likewise. Chil- 
dren survive by being confined in an environment where 
they cannot exercise such ‘‘ misplaced ’’ tendencies; ani-
-P-A-G-E-272
  258 FIXATION OF ARCS IN HABIT 
mals by reason of the fact that they (where they have 
survived in numbers) live in an environment where harm- 
ful stimuli (to which they do not respond negatively) are, 
in the main, lacking. An equally strong case can be made 
out for misplaced negative tendencies. To call those 
stimuli pleasant to which the animal positively reacts and 
unpleasant those to which he negatively reacts, is making 
a wholesale gratuitous assumption on a par exactly with 
the assumption made by the unreflective individuals who 
maintain that the moth flies into the candle because he 
likes the light or because the light is pleasant to him. 
Unquestionably we utilize these strong biological tendencies 
in the formation of habit. I.e., the animal is so constructed 
that in the presence of ‘‘ hunger ’’ it moves about; it re- 
sponds positively (or negatively) to light, ete. The utiliza- 
tion of these and other biological tendencies insures us that 
our organism must move in certain ways, and if he does 
he usually forms habits. (2) In the second place we have 
assumed that only the successful act is always fixed. This 
assumption is not true to the empirical facts, as can be 
shown. As an illustration we cite two actual cases, one 
from the work of Ulrich and the other from the work of 
Basset. In the latch box Ulrich had one animal that al- 
ways ran completely around the box before coming to the 
latch. Basset had one which ran completely around the 
box on his first trip without striking the plane, but always 
struck it on his second trip, i.e., he ran swiftly in a spiral. 
The experiment was tried of gradually extending the num- 
ber of trials in the case of these animals. But since the 
useless movement occurred every time the successful move- 
ment occurred, no improvement was noticed. There was 
no evidence that even a very large number of trials would 
cause the error to be eliminated. In the same way we have 
found one student making two extra spacing strokes on the 
Burroughs adding machine before pushing in the ‘‘total ’’ 
key. These extra movements were thoroughly fixed and 
would never have been eliminated except by accident. If 
the unsuccessful acts were not fixed along with the success- 
ful ones, it is clear that we should be dwelling constantly
-P-A-G-E-273
    
CERTAIN MISCONCEPTIONS 259 
in a world of virtuosi. (3) In the third place an assump- 
tion has been made concerning the neurological mechanism 
which, to our mind, has been productive of great con- 
fusion. It is assumed by a good many writers, as we saw 
above, that there is an ‘‘ overflow ’’ or ‘‘ diffusion phe- 
nomenon ”’ and that this diffusion or overflow can spread 
without having to pass through preformed neural chan- 
nels. In this way accidental connections are said to be made 
and bonds or associations to be established. But we have 
tried to point out in several places that the nervous system 
is not built to permit such functions. When a stimulus 
arises in a receptor there is just as orderly a progression 
of events then as later when the habit is formed, viz., the 
stimulus is carried off along preformed and definite arcs 
to the effectors in the order in which the arcs offer the 
least resistance to the passage of the current. This order 
may vary with variations in the sum of intra- and extra- 
organic stimulation. There is no formation of new path- 
ways.® 
In order to define the problem with which we have to 
deal more clearly, we will take an actual illustration. Sup- 
pose we present the rat with box I. He exhibits on the first 
test movements as follows: 
Die 2 oS 4.565 26d. 829 10. 11

place 3 sawdust

Crawls Strikes 
under opening 
floor with vibrisse and enters. 
In this case movements 3, 7, 15, 20 are necessary in the 
act as a whole. While we have numbered these movements 
serially, it would have been much better to have employed 
symbols for the movements and to have placed them at the 
ends of radii running to the center of a circle. The prob- 
lem box (stimulus) would represent the center of the circle 
*It is quite probable that the difficulty here is one mainly of 
terminology.
-P-A-G-E-274
260 FIXATION OF ARCS IN HABIT 
and the radii the ares leading to the separate movements. 
They occur in any fashion depending upon the condition of 
tension in the conductors. What we call progress in learn- 
ing comes about through the disappearance (dropping out) 
of all movements not needed in opening the box, such as 
1, 2, 4, ete. When all false movements have disappeared 
we have the separate acts released in the order 3, 7, 15, 20. 
Learning is then complete or perfect. Examination of most 
habits shows that only in rare instances do we ever reach 
the stage where only the successful movements appear and 
no others. Learning is usually a compromise. It is obvious 
that our problem concerns only the causes leading to the dis- 
appearance of all movements except 3, 7, 15, 20. It follows 
further that when the useless movements are eliminated 
the correct movements arise serially without any chaining 
or linking in any material sense (bonds, connections, etc.). 
Movement 20 cannot be executed until movement 3 has been 
executed, ete. Stated in other terms, we find no necessity 
for speaking of ‘‘ associations.’’ The ‘‘ association ’’ is 
given in heredity—the act by which the result is obtained is 
““ associated ’’ with the stimulus in the first place? Fur- 
thermore, there is no evidence for assuming that there is 
resolution of one physiological state into another. It will 
be remembered that Jennings and others have adopted the 
view that learning means the readier resolution of physio- 
logical states. However well the conception may work 
in the realm of organisms with no nervous systems, it 
will not work in that of the higher organisms. By physio- 
logical states we could mean nothing but the sum of ares 
and effectors at work (including under effectors, of course, 
glands, etc.). The physiological state changes when a 
new set of ares begins to function. To say that one re- 
solves into the other is unclear. 
Enumeration of some of the problems.—If we glance 
for a moment at the temporal distribution of the success- 
ful movement or movements we find several situations 
which deserve mention. With regard to I, motor habits, we 
19Tn certain cases this apparently is not the case. The “asso- 
ciation” seems to be indirect. (See p. 273.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
    
ENUMERATION OF PROBLEMS 261 
find: (a) One in which the successful act is necessarily 
the final one of the series, as, e.g., the solution of boxes I, 
II, and III. (b) One in which several acts are necessary 
for the solution: but during the learning stage, the first 
necessary movements having been accomplished, there may 
follow any number of useless movements. Likewise the sec- 
ond and succeeding movements as they are successfully 
accomplished may each in turn be followed by useless 
movements. This type of distribution is the one discussed 
above. (c) One which must be looked upon as involving 
the formation of a succession of simple habits like (a), 
above. The maze problem best illustrates this type, the 
culs de sac representing the series of problems, each one 
of which must be mastered before the problem as a whole 
is considered learned. It is necessary to say, though, that 
they do not have to be mastered in order, and furthermore, 
when they are mastered no separate account of the chaining 
process is required: The animal goes forward: having 
eliminated the culs de sac he necessarily goes straight from 
the entrance to the food box or exit. (It will be noted that 
b and ¢ are not essentially different.) In addition to this 
type of learning in motor habits we have a similar group 
connected with sensory habits. (d) The animal must learn 
to go towards one directive stimulus or away from it, when 
there is no fixed instinctive tendency to react either posi- 
tively or negatively to it (in cases where we directly utilize 
the positive or negative reactions to a given stimulus no 
learning is involved). As an example we cite the experi- 
ments on the testing of the limits of the spectrum of the 
chick, p. 385. (e) The animal must learn to go towards 
one directive stimulus or to go away from one or more 
directive stimuli (depending upon the fact whether we are 
using two or multiple stimuli methods) where no tendency 
is present to react positively to the positive stimulus and 
negatively to the negative stimulus (or stimuli). (f) It 
may be seen that in both (d) and (e) it is possible, where 
preliminary tests are made and show a positive tendency 
to go to one or the other stimuli, to force the animal to 
go towards the stimulus to which it ordinarily responds

in a negative way. There are various refinements and 
subdivisions possible in these various types, but these repre- 
sent, in the main, the important ones. 
Factors involved in fixationWe may confess at once 
that we have no new principles to offer in solving the 
problems involved in learning; but we hope that by stating 
our problems carefully and by clearing away the miscon- 
ceptions referred to, we shall be able to show in a convine- 
ing way that the mechanical principles with which we are 
already familiar and which can experimentally be shown 
to act in the way we maintain are sufficient to yield the 
solutions of those problems. We shall call these principles 
(1) frequency and (2) recency. Without claiming that 
they are the only ones operative, let us attempt to apply 
them in specific cases. 
Application of the principle of frequency in motor 
habits.—Let us take the simplest case first, the solving of 
a problem like that of the latch box (a, above). We will 
suppose that the animal displays movements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8,9, 10. Ten is the final and successful movement. But 
movements 1 to 10 inclusive do not embrace all of the reper- 
toire of the animal (actual observation.) Hence on the 
next trial the movements would need to be numbered (at 
random) 1, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 10; the third trial, 1, 7, 13, 10; 
the fourth trial, 6, 11, 4, 8, 10, ete. It will be seen by actual 
count that movement 10 is repeated more often than any of 
the other movements. The successful movement always ap- 
pears once in every trial. No other movement necessarily 
appears in every trial. It is obvious from this description 
+1 As we have pointed out, it is evident that what most authors 
mean on the mechanical side by the use of such terms as satisfactory, 
advantageous, producing pleasure, ete., is that the physiological tone 
of the organism is raised, and by the opposites of these, that the tone 
is lowered. Now it is perfectly obvious that heightening or lowering 
the tone of the organism may respectively increase or decrease the 
length of time required to form a given habit. So probably would 
the introduction of caffeine, strychnine or atropine or any other drug 
which will increase or decrease the reaction time, heighten or lower 
the irritability, but it is evident that this principle fixes useless as 
well as useful movements. It cannot be invoked as an eliminating 
agent,
-P-A-G-E-277
  
THE PRINCIPLE OF FREQUENCY 263 
that if any movement, e.g., 1 above, were repeated as 
often as ro it would become as fixed as 10. It is the 
principle of repetition operating so far. 
Justification for the use of the principle.—Our right to 
use the principle of frequency as a cause rather than as an 
effect of habit formation may be questioned. It may be 
argued with justice that movement 10 has nothing to favor 
it: that there is no reason to suppose that breaking such a 
chance series of movements each time after the successful 
act is performed (i.e., by the experimenter taking the animal 
out at the end of the trial and starting it over again) will 
cause 10 to appear more frequently than any other move- 
ment. This may be admitted. However, we know from the 
general theory of probability that in any chance temporal 
arrangement of events the probabilities are equal that any 
one of them will precede or will follow any other, and 
that in a large number of such chance arrangements of 
the same events any given event will precede each of the 
others in just half of the arrangements and will follow 
in the other half. But if now each temporal series is 
interrupted at the occurrence of the given event and the 
occurrence of all that follow is prevented the given event 
will occur twice as often as any other. A concrete ex- 
ample will illustrate this point. If ten slips of paper, 
numbered consecutively from 1 to 10, are drawn at random 
from a box until a certain number, 5, is obtained, the 
chances are equal that the required number 5, will pre- 
cede or will follow any other number, 9, e.g. If the drawing 
is interrupted when 5 is obtained and all the slips are 
returned to the box, and this procedure is repeated a num- 
ber of times, 5 will be present in every series of drawings, 
the number 9 in only those in which it, by chance, was 
drawn out before 5. Since this condition is met by only 
half of the series of drawings, the number 9 will appear 
only half as often as 5. The required number will appear 
twice as often as any other. In applying this principle let 
us suppose that the animal is capable of only two activities, 
A and B, when subjected to the stimulus offered by the 
problem box. B is the successful activity and leads to a
-P-A-G-E-278
  264 FIXATION OF ARCS IN HABIT 
change in stimulation which prevents the occurrence of 
either A or B (ie., the animal is taken out by the experi- 
menter, or he eats food and goes to sleep, deposits the 
straw in the nest, etc.). Then if the order in which A 
and B occur is due to chance only, B will occur twice as 
often as A. The following schema illustrates the fact that 
B occurs in every trial, A in only half: 
St — situation offered by problem box: stimuli are present, leading 
either to reaction A or reaction PB. But when B occurs (the successful 
movement) the animal is taken out by the experimenter,’* which pre- 
vents the occurrence of either A or B until it is reintroduced. Call 
the situation which follows upon B, St’:— 
    Trials Sequences A oceurs B occurs

(2) St-B-St’ 0 a

(4) St-B-St’ 0 Be 
(5) St-A-B-St’ et 
(6) St-B-St’ 0 a 
ete. _ = 
3 6 
For the operation of this principle of frequency it is 
necessary that the activities set off by the situation of the 
problem box be diverse—that the animal tend to go to 
some new activity rather than to continue to react in a 
circular way—e.g., to spend all his time biting at the wire. 
For if the chances for the repetition of the act just exe- 
euted are equal to the chances of proceeding to another 
act, breaking the series after any given activity will not 
affect its chance of repetition. This will be evident from 
the following diagram, where either of the acts A and B 
may be repeated in any given trial: 
2Under life conditions there is no “intervener.” of course. But the same effect is obtained. The animal gets food, lies down and sleeps, etc.,— i.e, becomes, from the standpoint of the stimuli which may affect it, a different animal. A further illustration follows: A bird in constructing its nest on the ground under a bush must needs pass through a narrow 
hole in the underbrush just before reaching the nest. In bringing straws he carries them crosswise; he pushes. flies away, tries again, drops the 
straw, passes through the hole, turns around, and again picks up the 
straw by tne middle and tries to pull it throuch. Finally he catches the straw on the end and pulls it through (B). The straw is then deposited in the nest and the situation develops (St’), which is exactly on a par 
with the one created by the experimenter when he removes the animal,

The behavior mechanism of the animal meets this re- 
quirement nicely. The animal’s activity depends upon 
the immediate conditions of stimulation. The perform- 
ance of one act places the animal under new conditions of 
stimulation which lead to some other activity rather than 
the one just executed.1® A simple example is shown in 
the following diagram. The figure represents a maze con- 
sisting of two arms, a and b, a being a blind alley, while 
b leads to the nest box. The animal is placed between 
the arms of the maze, at the original position of stimula- 
tion, St. He may go to either a or b (activities A and B). 
If B is chosen A cannot follow. If A is chosen B is more 
apt to follow A than is A itself, since the proprio-ceptive 
stimuli would tend to force the animal forward, after 
turning at the end of the alley a unless rival stimuli (smell, 
ete.) were present. Ie., the animal is now oriented 
towards St’ and would have to turn round in order again 
1° In order to keep the explanation in as simple a form as possible 
we have not brought out certain facts which every investigator knows 
he must take into account. When the animal is first released the 
problem box is not the only stimulating factor (complex in its 
stimulation though it is). Hunger is driving the animal, certain 
olfactory substances are calling out movements, contact stimulation is 
present and tending to call out movements, ete. Furthermore, the 
stimulating value of the problem box changes as the animal advances 
towards it and recedes from it,—i.e., the olfactory stimulation in- 
creases and decreases in intensity, the visual influences change like- 
wise. Oftentimes it is while executing responses to these various 
and changing stimuli that the animal happens to be in the neighbor- 
hood where the execution of movement 10 becomes effective. The 
animal has probably executed movement 10 (raising head) several 
times during the course of the trial but never before in the right 
place. To attempt to trace out these processes in detail would be 
futile,

to perform A.‘* The situation in the ordinary maze of 
the type of the Hampton Court may readily be presented 
by the following diagram (Fig. 52): 
Let A and B represent the segments of the true pathway 
and X the entrance to any cul de sac (let the segments be 
chosen somewhere in the middle of the maze). We will 
suppose that the animal is on its way to the position A 
for the first time. The chances of entering B and X are 
equal in the long run when the animal is in the position A. 
If the animal goes into B the true pathway scores one in 
frequency as over against the cul de sac. If the animal 
14 At first sight this argument would seem to militate against 
the second principle involved in habit formation, viz., recency. That 
the principle of recency is not jeopardized in this case appears when 
we consider that in order to test recency we should have to arrange 
conditions in such a way that the animal before turning at the end 
of the alley was placed again immediately at St, and furthermore, 
that he was in approximately the same physiological condition. 
After the animal has turned and has become oriented towards St’ 
additional factors have been introduced which militate against the 
recurrence of activity, A. We have to qualify our statements by 
saying “other things being equal” recency is a factor. In our 
original example of the latch box this condition is realized. A se- 
rious criticism may be urged against the use of recency when we 
consider the fact that an animal learns a problem far more rapidly, 
from the standpoint of number of trials necessary, when given only 
one trial per day than when given five trials in immediate succession. 
It is of course possible to soften the foree of this objection by main- 
taining that recency is operative in the five-trial method but that its 
effects are offset and masked by certain disturbing physiological 
conditions (as yet unknown) which occur when several trials are 
given in immediate succession,
-P-A-G-E-281
  THE PRINCIPLE OF FREQUENCY 267 
goes into the cul de sac X and follows it out to the bitter 
end it must return.* When it reaches the position of the 
letter X on the return again the chances of entering B 
and A are equal. We thus see that there is a greater 
probability of the animal’s remaining on the true pathway 
than of his leaving it. Possibly the case can be more 
definitely presented if we ask for the probability that the 
Fig. 52 
animal takes the wrong path. In order that this may 
occur it must (1) choose the wrong path from A to X 
and (2) choose the wrong path from X to A. The prob- 
ability of each wrong choice is %; the probability that 
both wrong choices be made is %x%—=%. The com- 
plementary probability or the probability that it takes 
the right path is %4. Ie., the chances are three to one 
that the animal goes out through B rather than comes back 
to the starting point.1* This factor (frequency) alone is 
1° Tt does not always return. Sometimes it goes to the end of the 
eul de sac and lies down. If this happens often enough the animal 
very quickly forms the habit of going to the end of the cul de sac 
and lying down and going to sleep. This is just as good and just 
as true a habit as if the maze had been completely traversed and 
learned. 
1° A type problem is this: What is the probability that heads 
be thrown at least once in two throws of a coin? The equally probable 
cases are these: HH, HT, TH, TT. Only the last is unfavorable 
whence the probability is 34. The argument that there are three 
cases HH, TH, TT, the last of which only is unfavorable (whence,

probably sufficient to account for the formation of the 
maze habit.'7 Apparently it is difficult to obtain any ex- 
planation based upon other factors. Even those who would 
maintain that the obtaining of food, or ‘‘ satisfiers,’’ to use 
Thorndike’s term, is the thing which stamps in move- 
ments, cannot apply that principle in these cases because 
of the fact that the “‘ satisfier ’’ is not obtained until the 
end of an extremely long series of movements is reached. 
Furthermore, actual observation shows that the culs de 
sac occurring early in the series are eliminated oftentimes 
before those oceurring later and hence in closer proximity 
to satisfaction.'* Hence there is no immediate connection 
between the obtaining of food and the elimination of 
errors, as must necessarily be called for on Thorndike’s 
first law. This phenomenon in itself is enough to make 
us hesitate before applying it. In the case of the less 
restricted activity permitted by the problem box, it is more 
difficult to define the relation of successive activities, but 
this difficulty is due, not to any difference in principle, 
but only to the greater complexity of the conditions. 
Application of the principle of recency in motor 
habits.—It should be clear that if there exist any factors 
which tend to influence the arrangement of the series of 
p=%), is fallacious unless we take account of the fact that the 
three cases are not equally probable. The probability of case TH is 
¥,; of cases HH and TT each 4. This evaluation of the cases leads 
to the argument. We are indebted to our colleague, Professor Coble 
of the mathematics department, for this development of the problem. 
17Tf it happens by chance that any cul de sac is entered as fre- 
quently as any segment of the true pathway, it becomes as firmly 
fixed as the true segment. We often find that certain culs de sac 
are favorably placed (position in the series) and it is these which 
are hardest to eliminate. Sometimes, indeed, they are never elimi- 
nated. It seems worth mentioning that the animal in the maze does 
not always choose the shorter of two pathways when a longer and a 
shorter are offered. 
18 Miss Hubbert, who has been making an extensive study of this 
question, states that in the circular maze (p. 100) white rats elimi- 
nate the errors in alley 4 first, if we neglect 6, the alley nearest to 
the food box. The justification for neglecting 6 arises from the fact 
that it contains no stop. The animal upon entering it may turn 
either to the right or to the left—i.e., it must run completely around 
the food box in order to make an error. As it passes the entrance 
the smell stimuli of course become directive.
-P-A-G-E-283
  THE PRINCIPLE OF RECENCY 269 
activities—to make one or another come earlier in the 
series—the progress of habit formation will be altered. 
Recency in problems, like that of opening boxes, seems to 
be such a factor. Its effect would tend to make the last 
act of the series (i.e., the successful one, 10 in our illus- 
tration) appear earlier. This will tend to decrease the 
probability of the occurrence of. all other activities and 
hence quicken the rate of the learning process. In apply- 
ing the principle in the particular case (problem above) 
we need to assume that on the first trial the initial resist- 
ance in are 10 has been overcome and its reaction threshold 
lowered. Since the stimulus originally tended to call out 
this reaction along with the others (was primitively or 
instinctively associated with it) and since there is no 
instinctive spacing (no instinctive order of release, as 
often is the case with instincts) of the separate acts, it is 
most natural to suppose, other things being equal, that 
movement ro will appear earlier on the second trial than 
on the first. We might go still further and maintain that 
if we could start with a case where the thresholds of 
stimulation in all the ares involved in the whole ten acts 
were equal, 10, being the most recent, would be the only 
one to appear on the second trial and on all succeeding 
trials. But the organism is never constructed in this way. 
The principles of repetition and recency must operate 
many times before the threshold of 10 becomes lower than 
that of any other set of arcs. In general it must be ad- 
mitted that recency is a much less potent factor in habit 
formation than is frequency. In certain habits such, for 
example, as those involved in the maze, its influence cannot 
very well be made out. 
Sensory habits—The problem in sensory habit is 
much more complicated. We will take (e) of our illus- 
tration (p. 261). The animal must learn to respond posi- 
tively always to one of the two stimuli, say yellow, or what 
amounts to the same thing, negatively to the blue. 
Whether in any given situation the animal actually does 
both we cannot say until careful tests have been made. 
The observed result is the same—the animal, in the illus-
-P-A-G-E-284
  
270 FIXATION OF ARCS IN HABIT 
tration chosen, always reacts to the yellow regardless of 
its right or left position (we are assuming that the wave- 
length difference is always effective from the standpoint 
of reaction, regardless of the energy difference of the 
two stimuli, ie., that the two objects really offer different 
stimulating values). In order to understand what happens 
we ask leave to simplify the problem slightly. Instead of 
two lights, yellow and blue, we will substitute two problem 
boxes, respectively A and B, in their places, leaving the 
other conditions the same, i.e., the two boxes are separated 
by a partition, the animal is released from the home box 
as before, ete. In order to further simplify the problem 
we will use at first only one box, A, in place of the yellow 
(positively reacted to). We will keep the box on the 
right side for the first set of trials. Releasing the animal 
now as before we find exactly the same situation that we 
found above, i.e., random movements giving place to the 
definite act of opening the box. After a time the animal, 
immediately upon release, goes to the right-hand side and 
opens the box. The next step is to place the box on the 
left-hand side. The animal, on release, will probably run to 
the right-hand side, then here and there, finally locating the 
box and opening it. We then change its position back to the 
right and repeat the routine. After a time this movement 
likewise becomes definite. What have we done? Two 
acts have been established, viz., one of opening the box 
and the other of following the box. In this case the act 
of opening was established first and that of following 
later, but it is easy to see that the act of following must 
be executed before the act of opening can be executed. 
Henceforth we shall call the act of following the box (1) 
and the act of opening (2). Now introduce the second 
box, B, on the left side, leaving A on the right side. It 
is essential to our hypothesis that B be somewhat different 
from A (ie., offer different stimulating value). Were 
box B not present the animal would rush immediately to 
A and open it. But putting box B on the left-hand side 
introduces a different stimulation, the intensity of which 
is such that it on its own account tends to release both
-P-A-G-E-285
FURTHER APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES 271 
the act of following (1) and the act of opening (2). Will 
the animal go to A or B? That depends purely upon the 
strength or intensity of the new stimulus (naturally we 
should consider here the momentary set of the animal 
and other intra-organic processes, ete). Suppose we intro- 
duce now the electric shock, and further, that the animal 
actually goes to B instead of to A. Before the subject 
reaches B the electric shock produces the avoiding reaction 
with the consequence that the animal turns over to A. 
The response to A becomes the most recent act. On the 
next trial we will assume that the same thing happens. 
We begin immediately to get the effect of repetition. 
The operation of the two factors, recency and repetition, 
combined with the process of substitution, which is dis- 
cussed in the next paragraph, will finally result in the 
establishment of the habit (provided the stimuli actually 
possess different stimulating values for the animal). If 
now we will go back and substitute the two lights, yellow 
and blue, for the boxes, A and B, and for the act of 
opening box A, that of going around to the food box, 
ete., we will see clearly that this simplified scheme 
has given us the essential factors in the formation of 
sensory habits. We see that the sensory habits are much 
more complicated than the motor, but that they are not 
fundamentally different. It may be argued that we have 
no right to develop the problem in this simplified way: 
that the habit may be formed when both stimuli are present 
from the beginning. We admit that the habit may be 
developed under such conditions but we argue that while 
the reactions called for on the part of the animal are more 
complex under those conditions, yet in the end the fixation 
process takes place as a result of the factors we have in- 
voked. In this connection we call attention to the almost 
unanimous verdict of experimenters to the effect that 
when both stimuli are present from the beginning the 
habit arises with difficulty or not at all. A reference to 
our work on the rat (p. 222) where yellow and blue of 
high intensity were introduced simultaneously at the be- 
ginning of the experiment, will show that the animal never
-P-A-G-E-286
  272 FIXATION OF ARCS IN HABIT 
formed the habit. It was only by using the positive stimu- 
lus alone until a perfect habit resulted that we were finally 
enabled to introduce the negative stimulus and thus to 
complete the test. 
Substitution.—By substitution we mean that a stimulus 
which originally did not call out a given response comes 
later to call it out. Two examples illustrate this very 
elearly. A green light at first does not call out the salivary 
secretion in large amounts in the Pawlow type of experi- 
ment (p. 66). After food has been presented immediately 
after the green light (or simultaneously with it; simul- 
taneity is not necessary) for a number of times, the green 
light calls out the secretion in large amounts. Or again: 
the experimenter claps his hands (A) and lays fish (B) 
upon the top of a cage containing a cat. The cat climbs 
to the top of the cage (R) and eats the food. We may 
put the course of events down in serial form: A, B, R. 
After a time the cat climbs up (R) immediately after the 
experimenter claps his hands (A): thus A, R; B seems 
to have become unnecessary. It is to meet this type of 
problem that has led Jennings to posit the concept of the 
“‘readier resolution of physiological states.’’ While the 
two types of behavior differ in several particulars, the 
processes involved are probably in general the same. We 
have to suppose, e.g., in the case of the cat’s reaction to 
the signal that on the first trial A aroused general reflex 
activity (S), while B aroused the definite instinctive (or 
habitual)* act of climbing up (R). In such a case we 
have to assume further (there is apparently no other 
hypothesis open) that while A could not arouse R until 
B had aroused it and thus lowered the resistance across 
the effector division of the are (Y) nevertheless it at- 
tempted to discharge into Y as well as into the more 
segmentally placed X. Le., A discharged or tended to dis- 
charge into R but at that moment the resistance was great 
and the impulse passed out over X, producing the move- 
ments (S), e.9., of clawing at the wires, purring, etc. We 
offer the following simplified neural diagram, Fig. 53. 
Granting the connection between the sensory division of the
-P-A-G-E-287
  
SUBSTITUTION 273 
are AS and the effector division of the are BR, we need 
to account for only one thing, viz., how it comes about that 
the stimulus aroused by A now passes through Y instead 
of through X, its original channel. If we watch the train- 
ing of the animal we find that A and B have to be gone 
through with serially many times before R will follow upon 
A. Before the substitution is established the response (R) 
has become extremely easy to set off (note the premature 
response which often occurs in human reaction experi- 
  Tia. 53 
ments). Resistance has been decreased by use until even 
the (assumed) weak impulse aroused by A is sufficient 
to call it out (it is not necessary to suppose that the re- 
sistance across X has changed). 
Repetition of movement in absence of original 
stimulus.—In both human and animal work we get cases 
where a series of movements is executed in a fixed order in 
the absence of the stimulus which originally called them 
forth. The process is again one of substitution, but some- 
what more complex than the one considered above. One 
of the most interesting of such cases is the learning and

later repetition of nonsense syllables. Presentation of a 
series of nonsense syllables to the eye may be illustrated as 
follows (Fig. 54) : 
Fop Dor Cor Bor Cou

Vie. 54 
Fod, Dor, ete., visual stimuli; a, b, ec, d, are running from eye to 
laryngeal muscle 1; e, segmental sensory neurone ending in mus- 
cle’ 1. 
As is well known, we are dealing here with the rear- 
rangement of established habit systems. The visual 
stimulus Fod sets up an impulse which releases activity 
in the laryngeal muscle 1 (either silent or overt saying 
of the word) and the rest of the syllables act in the same 
way. We know further that after this seriés has been gone 
through with a few times presentation (by any method 
whatsoever) of Fod forces the recall of the remaining 
syllables. We may illustrate the scheme where all extra- 
organic stimuli except the original stimulus are removed, 
as follows (Fig. 55) : 
In order to understand this we must go back to our 
first diagram. We see that when muscle 1 is thrown into 
activity by the visual stimulus aroused by Fod, a neural 
impulse is set up in the muscle spindles in 1. This im- 
pulse passing inward over the segmental (proprio-ceptive) 
neurone, e, may discharge theoretically into any muscle of 
the body but by reason of the high development of
-P-A-G-E-289

laryngeal habits, it comes about that the discharge back 
into the other muscles of the larynx is the easiest. But 
into which one? Before activity has ceased in 1, muscle 2

has been forced into activity by the external visual im- 
pulse. We make the assumption then that ease of dis- 
charge into muscle 2 is greatest, and that next in order 
come 3, 4, 5, 6, ete. From this time on muscle 2 may be 
called into activity equally through the kinesthetic impulse 
passing over e or through the visual impulse aroused by 
Dor. Consequently when F'od is presented and the remain- 
ing syllables are not presented, it is clear that the appro- 
priate kinesthetic impulses discharge in order into muscles 
3, 4, 5, 6, ete. We are dealing here with systems already 
so highly organized that a single reading of a series of seven 
syllables will often make the repetition of this series pos- 
sible. It is probable that these segmental! ares are “ fixed ”’ 
as a result of such factors as we have already considered.’® 
Physiological principles operative —Unquestionably 
the principles of reénforcement, inhibition, and summation 
of stimuli are constantly operative. When the separate

an are running from 1 to 3, from 1 to 4. ete.; also from muscle 1 to 
the muscle which functioned previously to the functioning of muscle 1. 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
    
276 FIXATION OF ARCS IN HABIT 
stages of habit have been more carefully analyzed we can 
more readily see how such factors operate in detail. 
Conclusions.—It is to be hoped that even this tentative 
and unsatisfactory presentation of the most important 
principles in fixation will lead to a more definite study of 
the mechanisms involved. The problem is in such a state 
that only careful experimentation will enable us to go 
further in its solution. It is a great deal easier to assume 
that pleasure stamps in the successful movement and that 
displeasure stamps out the unsuccessful and to let the mat- 
ter rest than to institute the necessary experimentation. 
But behavior has reached a critical stage and such explana- 
tions, however satisfactory in the past, no longer content us.

ing and enhancing the stimulus.—Putting the animal through the 
act.—Presentation of experimental results: Introduction. A.

Introduction.—So far in the treatment of habits we have 
discussed mainly those that have been formed without tui- 
tion, i.e., by the animal through its perseverance method. 
That there are so-called higher forms of learning has been 
warmly advocated by many experimenters and investiga- 
tors. Such forms have been treated under the general head 
of imitation. Examination of the concept of imitation 
shows that there is little agreement as to the meaning which 
the term should connote. It would seem wiser to treat the 
subject of imitation solely from the standpoint of behavior. 
From this standpoint real or genuine imitation should refer 
to a relatively instantaneous regrouping of old habits (1). 
It is presupposed thatrall elements (unit habits) are present 
and that the stimulus (pattern, act to be imitated or copied) 
leads to a response which, from the observer’s standpoint, 
is like the pattern. On the other hand, all that experiment- 
ers seem to have meant by imitation is that we can, by 
adopting certain methods of procedure, abridge the process 
of learning, or make learning possible in cases where the 
animal has failed to form the habit by its own unaided 
efforts (2). When the problem is approached from the 
standpoint of (2) it must be readily admitted that there are 
many factors which can both abridge the process of learn- 
ing and lengthen it. Some of these factors have already 
been discussed on p. 235. Whether there is real imitation in 
the sense of (1) in the animal world cannot be affirmed so 
readily (p. 281).

  278 ABRIDGMENT OF LEARNING PROCESS 
Lloyd Morgan’s classification of imitation.—The point 
of view suggested above has not, in general, been adopted. 
Examination of the literature shows that experimenters 
have usually chosen some anthropomorphic type of classi- 
fication of imitation, such as that outlined by Morgan, and 
have conducted their experimental tests in such a way as 
to throw into relief the expected kind of imitation. (1) 
Mimicry is the lowest type so far as classification goes. It 
lies, according to this writer, generally below the level of 
imitation. It is found widespread among insects. On ac- 
count of the many enemies which prey upon animals it has 
been supposed by the Darwinians that under the process 
of natural selection animals have become inconspicuous, 
ie., they have come to resemble (visually as a rule) the 
objects in their environment. This is supposed to afford 
protection from enemies. Once the race is established it 
is easy to see how the variants will be killed off on account 
of their conspicuousness. On the other hand, conspicuous- 
ness may be allowed under natural selection where that 
character is combined with inedibility. Now many con- 
spicuous edible forms are not eliminated because they have 
come to resemble the conspicuous inedible forms. We have 
already discussed the improbability of races arising in this 
way through the action of the Darwinian mechanisms 
(p. 166). However that may be, the mere fact of resem- 
blance as outlined above is unquestionably true. (2) In- 
stinctive imitation. This kind of imitation depends upon 
inherited mechanisms. As examples we may cite the fol- 
lowing instinctive group of activities; drinking, peering 
into cracks and holes, ete., warning cries taken up by 
birds and other animals, ete. Care is not always taken 
in these illustrations to insure against the possibility of 
response to a common stimulus, i.e., the stimulus which may 
have set off the response in the first animal may also have 
acted upon the other members of the group. There seem to 
be genuine cases, though, where the stimulus acts upon one 
animal, inducing an instinctive mode of behavior which in 
turn becomes the common stimulus causing group activity. 
In regard to the first of these types, mimicry, it may be
-P-A-G-E-293
CLASSIFICATION OF IMITATION 279 
said that there seems to be no valid reason to consider such 
phenomena under imitation at all. Mimicry, except in cer- 
tain cases, is not a form of behavior at all, but a morpho- 
logical or anatomical character.t. The second division, in- 
stinctive imitation, falls under the general head of instinct 
since such acts as we have included in this group are 
seen at once to be congenital and not in any way involv- 
ing the process of learning. It is better to group such 
responses under some such title as that of social instincts. 
Morgan’s third division, (3) intelligent imitation, is the 
type usually referred to in discussions on imitation in gen- 
eral. It is in this third class (and in its finer subdivisions, 
such as inferential imitation, etc.) that we find confusion of 
meaning. It is openly anthropomorphic. Experimenters have 
reported the finding of imitation of this type through the 
use of the following devices: (1) by the experimenter show- 
ing the animal how to do an act; (2) by allowing a trained 
animal to perform before an untrained animal; (3) by 
“putting the animal through ’’ the act; (4) finally by 
** encouraging ’’ the animal. Before trying to evaluate the 
effects of the above devices, it is presupposed that the ani- 
mal has failed to learn by his own unaided efforts, or at 
least that he has worked at the problem indefinitely until 
the situation no longer offers stimulation for activity, or 
finally that we are reasonably sure of the number of trials 
that the animal would take to learn the problem by the 
perseverance method. If we examine these devices and strip 
from them their anthropomorphic implications we find 
that all of them except (3) are methods really for localizing 
and enhancing the intensity of the stimulus [(3) is sepa- 
rately considered on p. 282]. 
Localizing and enhancing the stimulus.—In actual 
practice the stimulus may be localized and enhanced in a 
variety of ways: by the experimenter doing the act before 
the animal; by pointing to the apparatus and moving cer- 
1 Numerous exceptions to this statement may be found in fish, e.g., 
the flounder, and possibly in certain reptiles (the chameleon). There 
is no justification for considering such responses as these under the 
head of imitation at all since they depend upon reflex and inherited 
mechanisms,
-P-A-G-E-294
280 ABRIDGMENT OF LEARNING PROCESS 
tain parts of the mechanism, ete.; by allowing one animal 
to learn by the perseverance method and using him as an 
imitatee. His attack upon the apparatus will serve the 
same purpose as that of the experimenter.2, When using 
this method two things should be kept sharply in mind as 
was indicated above, p. 277: either (1) the experimenter is 
trying to call forth a new combination of old habits (i.e., 
imitation according to our definition; or (2) he is trying 
to get the animal to form the habit de novo. We have never 
sharply separated these two issues. Usually we might say 
(1) has always been in the mind of the experimenters. All 
of us, in such experiments, have plunged in medias res by 
giving the animal exceedingly complex acts to imitate with- 
out being sure that all of the elements are present, or 
whether there was flexibility enough in the elements (p. 49) 
which were present. What can we hope to get from such 
an unscientific procedure? Behavior seemingly is estab- 
lishing the point that each simple codrdination (not con- 
genital) is acquired by the perseverance method, hence the 
pattern, or the act to be copied should be made up of sim- 
pler acts already acquired. The novelty present in the act 
as a whole is the method of combination (temporal spacing 
of the elements). It may be argued that in all the tests on 
imitation we are sure that the unit acts are all present be- 
fore we start. Each one of our monkeys knows how to put 
his hand up a shute, turn a button, lift up a latch, ete.— 
we have trained him to do this before setting the pattern 
for imitation. The reply is ‘‘ Yes, those codrdinations are 
present, but they are not flexible enough.’’? Nearly every 
human being knows how to move his feet alternately back- 
ward and forward and to turn while moving them, yet the 
average man learns a new dance with appreciable difficulty. 
Merely watching the movements of some one else in dancing 
is not usually a sufficient stimulus to set free the appropriate 
movements. Most of us have to be pushed, pulled, twisted 
through it before the act follows of itself (i.e., through the 
? Hobhouse holds that in the ease of some animals a mere hint, i.e., 
a mere motion towards the correct act, is sufficient to make the 
animal go through the act correctly,
-P-A-G-E-295
  NATURE OF IMITATION 281 
action of the proprio-ceptive ares.) On the other hand, 
the dancing master and many women, through long practice, 
have trained their feet and legs as well as their hands and 
arms, and can execute the variations of the dance the mo- 
ment the pattern is set. If it is agreed that the above 
analysis of what is involved in the act of imitation is, in 
large measure, correct, it is obvious that very few experi- 
ments so far reported upon animals (and very few of 
those on children), really touch the problem of imitation 
(ie., of making new combinations immediately from among 
old habits) at all. It may be argued with justice that we 
ean never be sure in advance that there are a sufficient 
number of codrdinations at hand, and that practically all 
we can do is to take the animal as we find him, subject 
him to the influences of the devices enumerated, and see 
what happens. Until it becomes possible to take some an- 
thropoid apes and bring them up practically as children 
are brought up, with varied training and with wide educa- 
tion of hands, it is probable that what we shall mainly be 
doing in such work is the testing of the formation of habits 
with stimuli enhanced. But the results of this type cannot 
be differentiated from the hastening, or the reverse, one 
gets through introducing pain stimulation, drugs, heighten- 
ing tonicity through more potent stimuli,—as when toasted 
cheese is used in the case of the rat instead of bread, sex 
in the case of the rabbit, ete. Under proper manipulation 
such factors can be made to hasten or retard a given habit, 
depending upon the fact whether these stimulations are 
arranged to reénforce the desired response or to inhibit it. 
To illustrate what is meant: one can take the female rabbit 
and enclose her in a cage along with food, and close a 
door which may be opened by the turning of a button. 
Activity of the sort calculated. to produce the first success 
will be hastened in the male, which is placed on the outside. 
Now, if the box is arranged as before with food alone on 
the inside, and the female is left with the male, the latter 
will respond to the more potent sex stimulus to the neglect 
of the problem before him. Rats which have lain down 
in the maze,—given up the problem,—can be made active  
-P-A-G-E-296
  282. ABRIDGMENT OF LEARNING PROCESS 
again by the introduction of another animal. Chickens 
hasten more rapidly through the maze if they can hear their 
fellows pecking on the outside, ete. 
Putting the animal through the act.—A reference to the 
literature will show that positive results are being accumu- 
lated by the use of this method. The theoretical envisage- 
ment of the problem involved in the interpretation of these 
results is difficult. All we can do, apparently, is to admit 
the general fact and to wait for more extended work to 
bring analysis. If putting the most motile organ (paw, 
beak, etc.) of an animal slowly through the various parts 
of an act brought a hastening of the act as a whole, inter- 
pretation would at least be theoretically possible. But 
with the exception of Cole, in his work upon the raccoon, all 
have failed to get positive results from this method. On 
the other hand, it is possible to get both the rat and the 
raccoon to climb to the top of a box and drop through a 
trap to the floor of the box (which is quite foreign to their 
instinctive organization) after they have been passively 
dropped through the trap on various occasions. It would 
seem that in this method we have an additional (i.e., to the 
perseverance method) way of establishing a simple co- 
ordination in an animal. Yet we are not willing to admit 
this until there has been made a very thorough analysis of 
the factors which enter into it (p. 298). 
Presentation of experimental results: introduction.— 
From these preliminary statements concerning the general 
problem of higher forms of learning it will be seen that it 
is impossible to present the results which have been obtained 
in any thoroughly systematic and unitary way. The 
technique of making the tests has been as varied as the 
presuppositions held by the different investigators. Ac- 
cordingly the results will be presented in some detail. 
A. Primates.—Thorndike concludes in general that 
learning in the monkey (Cebus) cannot be hastened by the 
methods under consideration. He found that opening the 
door of a given box for the monkeys had no effect upon the 
rapidity with which they learned to open it. Thorndike’s 
usual method was to ‘‘ attract the attention ’’ of the monkey
-P-A-G-E-297
  
  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 283 
or to wait until the animal was looking at the experimenter, 
and then to open the box slowly, emphasizing the move- 
ments. The monkey would then be given a trial without 
tuition; or the experimenter would repeat his act several 
times before allowing the animal to try the box. All ex- 
periments of this type failed to yield positive results. They 
profited just as little by the tuition of other trained ani- 
mals. One animal was allowed to open the box by the 
perseverance method. This animal was then used as the 
imitatee. The imitatee worked with the imitators near at 
hand. Negative results were again obtained. Monkeys 
fail to learn, according to the same writer, by being put 
through the movements. Thorndike made several such tests 
upon the monkeys. One animal was carried to the top of a 
table and fed there, and then tested to see if it would go 
to the table of its own accord. This was repeated ten 
times, and then the animal was released. In no case did 
this monkey or any other give an imitative response. 
Watson’s experiments were made upon monkeys (M. 
rhesus) which were quite tame. Two of the monkeys were 
quite friendly with each other. J was an adult monkey and 
B a young one. In a short time an attachment sprang up 
between these monkeys which persisted for several years. 
B was wild and restless and became excited when J was 
away from him. J on his part would run to B on certain 
cries and put his fore-paws around B’s neck. B would 
nestle up to J and clasp him around the chest. If B did 
not become placid under this treatment, J would rock him 
from side to side and give out a little companionable chat- 
ter. Under these conditions, it is quite evident that J’s 
reactions influenced B’s greatly. When J went to one part 
of the cage B followed. If, while sitting on the shelf, a pan 
of water or bowl of milk was placed upon the ground, B 
would not come down to drink if J did not precede him. 
J formed the habit of jumping on to the experimenter’s 
shoulder when he entered the cage and called. B formed 
the same habit, but if J for any reason refused to come, B 
refused also. If B were loose in the room when the experi- 
menter passed with J on his shoulder, B would run to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
284 ABRIDGMENT OF LEARNING PROCESS 
experimenter immediately. But, on the other hand, if J 
was not on his shoulder, B paid not the slightest attention to 
the experimenter’s commands. At times J and B were left 
loose in the animal room. Sometimes J was refractory 
and did not care to go into the cage. B would never go in 
unless J did. It was necessary to threaten him at times 
with a long stick. J would walk around the cage two or 
three times before entering it, but always just out of reach. 
B trailed J and when the latter finally darted through the 
door of the cage B darted in also. It was almost impossible 
to force B in unless J had preceded him. Several types of 
problems were given the animals in the work upon imita- 
tion. (1) Drawing in food with a rake, animal to imitate 
the experimenter; (2) drawing in food with a cloth, animal 
to imitate the experimenter; (3) obtaining food from 
bottom of bottle by the use of a fork, animal to imitate the 
experimenter; (4) pushing out food from middle of long 
glass cylinder by means of stick, animal to imitate experi- 
menter; (5) manipulation of old-fashioned latch, animal 
to imitate experimenter; (6) box with a door in top not 
held in place by any fastening, animal to pull open door by 
means of a handle, B to imitate J; (7) box with door in top 
held in place by push button, B to imitate J. The monkeys 
very quickly form by their own unaided efforts such habits 
of manipulation, but so far as our observations went they 
were entirely uninfluenced by tuition. In the simple prob- 
lems, such as pushing out food from a glass cylinder, pull- 
ing in food with a rake or cloth, ete., we failed wholly in 
obtaining positive results. When the animal is placed in 
such situations it at once begins to strain at its tether 
and to reach out after food with its paw. It would often 
pick up the stick or cloth, bite it, and then discard it, but 
it would never attempt to go through with the act of push- 
ing out the cloth or stick, throwing it over the object, then 
pulling it in. In other words, our conclusions exactly har- 
monize with those of Thorndike and are entirely against 
Hobhouse’s type of results. We did find evidence for 
certain types of reaction which are generally included under 
the head of instinctive imitation. With Kinnaman we
-P-A-G-E-299
  
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 285 
found that if one monkey discovered a hole and peeked into 
it, another would generally push him aside and peek into it 
in his turn. This was observed several times. More re- 
cently we have confirmed these observations many times in 
the case of a mother and baby. One day the baby left the 
mother’s arms and peered under a sill at a brass lock which 
could be seen from his viewpoint but not from hers. He 
pushed his arm through and attempted to pull the lock 
forward. The mother left off eating, came and adopted the 
same position and reached her arm through and attempted 
to grasp the lock. The two acts were identical in technique. 
We found also that certain acts which resulted in a sound 
would be rhythmically repeated. In one case one of the 
monkeys (Cebus) filched a large tablespoon. He was 
found standing the spoon on one end and then immediately 
releasing it. Dropping the spoon seemed not to be acci- 
dental but actually a part of the act. He repeated this act 
15 times in unvarying order and, so far as could be judged, 
at definite intervals of time. This corresponds, in our 
opinion, very closely to the child’s act of repeatedly ham- 
mering its spoon against the table. Hammering with a 
nut or any small, hard, preferably round, object was an- 
other favorite trick of the Cebus monkey. In one case the 
animal tapped with a small hickory nut 150 times in one 
half hour. In the forest this is possibly connected with 
some kind of food-getting process, although we have no 
assurance of this. Rhesus J also gave evidence of a similar 
type of action. Occasionally he would sit and play with a 
small hard object, let it slip through his fingers to the 
board on which he sat, pick it up again, and drop it. One 
instinctive act could at times be called out in J, that of 
flea catching. As is well known, this is probably the most 
frequent act indulged in during their quieter moments. 
The smacking sound used by the monkeys in this act is 
easily imitated. On one occasion J allowed the experi- 
menter to hunt fleas over him. After performing this act 
J perched upon his shoulder but made no attempt to pick 
him. The experimenter then held up the hairy portion of 
his arm.to J but he made no effort to hunt for fleas! The  
-P-A-G-E-300
  286 ABRIDGMENT OF LEARNING PROCESS 
smacking sound was then made with the lips. J immedi- 
ately made the sound in turn and began searching the arm, 
and then proceeded to the experimenter’s neck (the experi- 
menter was wearing a rubber cap which extended down over 
his ears). Haggerty worked for several months on the 
rhesus and Cebus monkeys. The animals were placed in 
the presence of simple mechanical devices the manipula- 
tion of which opened doors, disclosed openings, or dropped 
food into the cage. Each animal was given a fair oppor- 
tunity to imitate in a series of preliminary trials,—usually 
15 in number, each 15 minutes in length and given on suc- 
cessive days. In almost every case the animal had either 
solved the problem by the end of that time or had lost in- 
terest in it. Imitation experiments were then begun upon 
the animals which had failed. The trained animal was 
allowed to perform in the presence of the imitator. After 
this the imitator was given an opportunity to try the 
mechanism. He was allowed to work 10 minutes, and longer 
if he seemed on the point of making the successful move- 
ments. If he failed the test was repeated. He was not 
considered as having failed to imitate until 100 opportuni- 
ties for profiting by tuition had been given. Under these 
conditions Haggerty obtained 16 cases of imitation, 3 of 
which were immediate, and 5 eases of partially success- 
ful imitation. Of the 11 animals used by him but 2 failed 
to exhibit imitative behavior in one test or another. Hag- 
gerty mentions the fact that animals imitate best when not 
too thoroughly accustomed to one another. He states that 
these cases are cases of imitation of the inferential type. 
We are not able to agree with him. In the first place, his 
method of allowing the animals to have 100 chances for 
imitation before considering tuition without effect must 
always give ambiguous results. With an animal as agile 
and as varied in his interests as the monkey, it is never 
possible to tell when a burst of activity will lead to the 
solution of the problem by the perseverance method. On the 
other hand, it is possible to assume that the only effect of the 
act of the imitatee was to set off two congenital forms of 
response on the part of the imitator. The one was the
-P-A-G-E-301
  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 287 
following instinct,—i.e., to go to the place where a group 
of monkeys had just been and to peer into the same holes 
that other monkeys had just peered into, ete.; and the other 
the tendency to attack moving objects first. The general 
perseverance method of the animal took care of the remain- 
ing factors. Kinnaman reports instances where he observed 
that the acts of the male monkey (M. rhesus) influenced the 
responses of the female. In one case where food was to be 
had by pulling out a plug, and in another where food 
could be obtained by bearing down upon a lever, the female 
had had opportunity to learn without tuition but had failed. 
The male had learned by his own efforts. He was allowed 
to perform in front of the female. She went at once in 
each case, after seeing the male get the food, and operated 
the mechanisms, and then repeated the acts later several 
times. Witmer was not very successful in getting Peter, 
the chimpanzee, to imitate the trainer in fitting the form 
blocks into their appropriate holes. He states that better 
success was obtained with him in the imitation of the letter 
W, which was placed upon a blackboard. Witmer also cites 
the case of a monkey (M. cynomolgus) in opening a door. 
He maintains that this door was opened for the first time 
by the monkey. There is nothing in his paper that would 
show that he knew anything about the previous history of 
the monkey. Opening a door is one of the easiest things 
that a monkey does. Time and time again we have had 
them unhook doors, twist off wires which were wrapped 
around doors, break wires, take a round knob and turn it 
with the hind-feet while holding on to a nail in the wall 
with the fore-feet. All of these acts were readily learned 
without tuition and in the absence of the experimenter. It 
is very easy to be deceived about the accomplishments of an 
animal not under daily observation. Shepherd repeated 
several of the tests made by Watson and by Hobhouse. In 
one of his imitation tests he used a glass tube 15 inches in 
length and of an inch in diameter fitted with a plunger 
which could be easily taken out and inserted. All failed to 
imitate. The animals would take up the plunger, throw it 
down, pick it up, insert it in the mouth, bite it, and then  
-P-A-G-E-302
  288 ABRIDGMENT OF LEARNING PROCESS 
again discard it. They were also tried with a T-rake. 
Nearly all failed. None pushed out the rake and hooked 
the prong over the food. Monkeys 3 and 7 learned to 
push out the rake and with much slashing about of the 
T end to succeed in drawing in the food. The act was very 
awkward for them. One of the monkeys would many 
times knock the bit of food away. The best that can be 
said is that the animal learned to imitate the experimenter 
in pushing the rake out, but only awkwardly in hooking 
the rake around the food and pulling it in. These codr- 
dinations were never smoothly executed by the two monkeys. 
There is some slight evidence that one of them learned 
something from the tuition of the other. In another type 
of test positive results of a fairly satisfactory kind were 
obtained. A banana was suspended by a string from a 
horizontal rod attached to the wall of the room. The 
banana was entirely out of reach of the monkey unless he 
would push a horizontally placed pole (pivoted at one end 
and supported by a railing at the other) under the 
banana. Having done this he was able to mount the pole 
from the ground and to reach the banana from the pole. 
While in general the monkeys learned this problem by the 
perseverance method, there were certain indications that 
imitation was involved. In the case of monkeys Hobhouse 
cited the behavior of the chimpanzee P which had learned 
previous to the tests under consideration to throw his rake 
out and over the food that was out of his reach and then 
clumsily to roll it in. Hobhouse taught P to substitute a 
stick with a crook at one end for the rake. Food was 
placed in a light box. The chimpanzee learned in time 
to hook the end of the stick into the box and pull it in. 
The animal learned rapidly to use a short stick to bring 
in a longer one—the latter enabling him to obtain food 
which was beyond the reach of the short rod. Hobhouse 
tried to teach the chimpanzee to throw a rope with a noose 
in it over the box and bring in the food in this way, but 
even when he got the noose around the box he did not 
complete the response by pulling it in. The M. rhesus mon- 
keys were much slower in learning to use the stick. They 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 289 
did not succeed apparently any better than those used in 
the author’s experiments. Hobhouse’s M. rhesus did not at 
first learn to use the short stick to pull in the longer one. 
He later learned to use a stick quite frequently and when it 
was out of reach even to use substitutes for it, such as a 
child’s skipping rope, wire, cord, ete. Hobhouse reports 
an interesting act in the MW. rhesus: food was placed on a 
table just out of reach of the monkey. However, the tether 
was long enough for him to reach the food provided a 
chair or box was pushed between him and the table. He 
rapidly learned to push the chair into position and to 
mount it. 
B. Cats.—Berry states that the Manx cat is very much 
influenced by the behavior of its associates. In learning a 
problem box a trained animal was used as the imitatee. 
In one case it was shown that cat M refused to turn a but- 
ton which would have released her until cat X had turned 
it several times in front of her. In rolling a ball into a 
hole cat Y refused to do it until the trained animal had 
performed in front of him. The presence of imitation 
was found in such acts as pulling a knotted string which 
would release a door. Instinctive imitations such as going to 
the same place and looking down the same hole, scratching 
at the same place, and so on, are also reported by Berry. 
Thorndike failed to get cats to imitate. Trained animals 
were allowed to perform in front of the untrained animals. 
Several simple experiments like the following failed to 
yield positive results: The cats were placed in a large 
box with a door in the top; the experimenter went to the 
box and opened the door to get the animals out. The 
first cat up was always taken out first and fed before the 
others. Usually they climbed up to the door on the ap- 
proach of the experimenter. Of 3 recently purchased ani- 
mals 1 had not acquired the habit by the end of the tenth 
day. Even though a piece of fish were held up to him he 
would not climb up. It is reasonable to suppose that 
imitation, if at all prominent in their lives, would have 
overcome this sluggishness. Thorndike then put 2 trained 
cats in the cage with this animal and had them climb up
-P-A-G-E-304
  290 ABRIDGMENT OF LEARNING PROCESS 
80 times before his eyes and get the food. No positive re- 
sults were obtained. In one other interesting test they 
again failed. All animals of a certain group were taught 
to climb to the top of a large cage on the approach of the 
experimenter with food. Two animals, then, were trained 
to go up on a signal. One of these trained animals was put 
into the cage with the untrained animals. On the signal the 
trained cat would go up, but the untrained animals would 
not go up until the approach of the experimenter. This 
association was not very quickly formed, although it was 
learned in time by the perseverance method. Warren re- 
ports a case of delayed imitation in the cat. One of the two 
pets formed, through efforts of its own, the habit of climbing 
into the experimenter’s lap, then on to his shoulder and out 
over his outstretched arm to a piece of meat held on a fork. 
The companion of this cat made no attempt to perform 
the trick, although watching the trained animal feed in 
this way daily. This second cat had often been coaxed 
to make the effort. One day, however, (after the owner 
had been absent for some time) after watching the trained 
animal feed, it suddenly sprang into the experimenter’s 
lap, walked out over his arm, and seized the meat. After 
this it became the sturdy rival of the cat which had first 
learned the trick. 
C. Dogs.—Thorndike has made similar tests upon the 
dog. After the dogs had failed to open a given box, the 
experimenter went through the act. The dogs failed in 
all cases to profit by such tuition. One dog had been 
taught to jump up on a box and “‘ beg ’’ when a piece of 
meat was held above his head. He did this 110 times in 
the presence of an untrained animal. The untrained ani- 
mal never learned to imitate. Putting the animal through 
the act proved just as unavailing as in the case of monkeys. 
In such experiments the animal was left at its task for a 
few minutes, and if it failed to work the mechanism the 
experimenter would place his hand in the cage, take the 
dog’s paw and force it through the act of pulling the 
string or working the lever, as the case might be. This 
he would repeat again and again. At the end of 10 to 15
-P-A-G-E-305
  
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 291 
minutes he would test the animal alone. None of the ani- 
mals failing to learn by its own unaided efforts ever learned 
by being ‘‘ put through.’’ 
D. Raccoons.—On the question as to whether raccoons 
imitate there is much difference of opinion. Cole says that 
they imitated his movements in pressing down the lever 
of a card displayer (which finally resulted in their obtain- 
ing food). Sometimes they apparently worked the lever 
as the experimenter had done and at others at least at- 
tempted to work it in that way. After a few days they 
began to watch the experimenter’s hand very closely. He 
admits that they do not imitate their mates. He finds 
further that the raccoons learn by being ‘‘ put through.’’ 
He tried Thorndike’s experiment of dropping the animals 
into the experiment box. The animal was picked up by 
the back of its neck and dropped into the box. It had to 
open the door to get out and obtain a bit of food. At the 
end of 33 to 57 trials the animals learned to turn and go 
back into the box if the door was left open. If they found 
the door closed the raccoons would climb up the sides of 
the box and drop in through the hole at the top. In the 
case of these animals there is some evidence that they learn 
more quickly if passively ‘‘ put through ’’ the movements of 
working a simple mechanism. The main effect appears im- 
mediately after they are ‘‘ put through ’’ the act. The effect 
is very transient. An animal never failed to work the 
mechanism if given a ‘‘ put through ”’ trial at first. He 
otherwise often failed in the early stages. Cole states that 
they can be made to learn an act by tuition after having 
failed to learn it without tuition. The animals did not al- 
ways duplicate the act exactly, although they could be 
taught to do even this. Shepherd failed to get such satis- 
factory evidence of imitation in the raccoon. His animals 
had been trained to solve problems involving the manipula- 
tion of levers, ete., for about 3 months. His imitation 
apparatus consisted of an inclined plane of poultry netting 
25 em. wide supported at one end by a box. From the box 
the plane extended diagonally across the room to a platform. 
The raccoons could mount the box from the floor of the
-P-A-G-E-306
    292 ABRIDGMENT OF LEARNING PROCESS 
room. At a given signal the trained raccoon would mount 
the box and walk up the plane to the platform where he 
was fed. This animal was the imitatee. Two others were 
used as imitators. Several experiments failed to show a 
more rapid learning on the part of-the imitators than 
would be called for by the assumption that their learning 
was of the perseverance type. Davis reports one case of 
doubtful imitation in the raccoon. For the most part he 
failed to find any trace of it. Two experiments are cited: 
A blind coon was taught to climb to a platform in the middle 
of the room. Upon this he would stand and beg for food. 
Another raccoon was taught to climb up with the blind 
animal, but although this animal had seen the blind coon 
stand up and beg for food many times it would never, on 
its own account, imitate the act. One animal was taught to 
jump for food up to 3 feet in height. He was always in 
the midst of the pack when he performed this act, yet none 
of the other animals ever attempted to imitate it. 
E. Rodents.—Berry states that the white rat will 
imitate simple actions. If one rat begins digging another 
one will come up and begin to dig also. In other experi- 
ments less instinctive acts were said to have been imitated. 
It is extremely questionable whether the rat has sufficiently 
developed visual receptors for such a complex stimulus as 
the performance of another animal to lead to such com- 
plicated motor results. Such results would be very dif- 
ficult to account for when we consider that it has been 
shown that the rat learns with great difficulty to respond 
to even large differences in size, pattern, and intensity of 
visual stimuli. Dr. Florence Richardson in her work at 
the University of Chicago was not able to obtain positive 
results on rats when they were tested in an apparatus as 
nearly like Berry’s as could be made from his description. 
Imitation of the following type has been admitted by every 
one since the work of Small appeared. Hunter finds that 
the white rat can learn by being “‘ put through ”’ an act. 
As a part of the daily routine of an experiment upon a 
group of rats it was found necessary to deposit each ani- 
mal, after completing his quota of work, in a small box.
-P-A-G-E-307
  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 293 
This was accomplished by lifting the animal up and drop- 
ping it through a hole in the top of a box resting on the 
table which held the living cage. The animal remained in 
the box until all the members of the group had been worked 
with, after which the group as a whole was removed to 
the living cage and there fed. On the two hundred and 
fourth day after experiments had begun the door of the 
living cage was left open by accident. Two of the 5 rats 
climbed to the top of the small box and dropped to the 
floor of their own accord and remained there, as was their 
custom during the regular routine of experimentation. A 
regular set of tests was then initiated. Several results of 
this character were obtained.* Yerkes failed to get imi- 
tation in the dancing mouse. He allowed a trained animal 
to escape from a box by climbing up a ladder. This trained 
animal performed before untrained animals many times. 
The untrained animals failed to profit by the copy. A 
similar condition of affairs resulted when discrimination 
tests were tried. The animals responded individually. 
Seldom would one even follow the other. Again, some 
of his animals were taught to pull and others to push in a 
door of an experiment box. Those which had learned to 
push out doors did not learn to imitate those which had 
learned to pull in doors in situations which demanded the 
latter type of response. Although abundant opportunity 
was given in a variety of acts, no imitation was found. 
This has been confirmed by other observers on different 
varieties of mice. Allen states that the guinea pig can be 
“tolled ’’? through certain movements (thus supplying 
* It is possible, but probably unwise, to interpret this act in a 
rather simple way. After the animals are dropped into the box a 
habit of remaining there is formed. The floor of the interior of the 
box often reacted to may, whenever sensed, lead to the old response 
of jumping down upon it. The rats, when let out inadvertently, do 
as all rats do, run over every available inch of surface. On arriving 
at the top of the box the stimulus of the floors and sides leads to the 
old response. Rats often climb over the interior of a box and over its 
cover, jumping at times to the floor. There are many obvious ways 
of controlling this response, by the use of blind and anosmic animals, 
by putting the animal through a door in the side, ete. Until some 
one does this, we shall not know what factors are involved. 
 
-P-A-G-E-308

its own motor impulse) which has the effect of hastening 
the formation of the habit. 
F. Birds—Thorndike gave his chicks the chance of 
imitating the act of pecking at a door, jumping up and 
with the neck pulling down a string, stepping on a plat- 
form, pecking at a tack, ete. In no case was imitation 
found. Porter offers a new criterion of imitation, as fol- 
lows: Bird No. 1 is allowed to open a problem box by 
the perseverance method. Bird No. 2 which has not learned 
to open it, or else has a different and possibly a poorer 
method of opening it, is allowed to work upon the problem 
with bird No. 1.4 If either bird changes its method, dis- 
carding a poor one for a better one, or if the untrained 
animal should suddenly pick up the method, imitation is 
present. In all cases, except where the tests were made 
upon blue jays, Porter found positive evidence of imita- 
tion. The birds giving positive results were English spar- 
rows, cow birds, juncoes, white-throated and field sparrows, 
song sparrows, Baltimore orioles and crows. Birds of the 
same species imitate one another more readily than they 
do birds of a different species. Baldwin in personal con- 
versation mentioned a case of delayed imitation in the 
parrot. He tried to teach this parrot to sing ‘‘ Over the 
Fence Is Out.’’ The bird would never attempt to repeat 
the words while the experimenter was present. One morn- 
ing, though, as he came down the steps, the bird started in 
with the melody.> The observations of Scott and of Con- 
radi, showing that the type of song which develops in a 
given bird is largely dependent upon the nature of the 
songs of the other birds confined in its neighborhood, 
have already been mentioned in another connection (p. 
142). Lashley has recently confirmed this work and ex- 
* The two birds are likely to fight. Porter supposes that by this 
process he makes the stimulus to get at the food or to work at the 
problem far greater than by the ordinary method; e.g., he states that 
“rivalry” is a strong motive. 
* He has since published a similar observation: Baldwin, J. Mark.

tended it. He finds that when an Amazon parrot 
(Chrysotis), which does not talk, is confined with a bird 
which does, the untrained animal begins to repeat at first 
very indistinctly the words of the trained parrot. These 
gradually become more definite. The untrained animal 
in this case profited much more rapidly from the tuition 
of its fellow than from that of the experimenter. This 
same investigator has tested to what extent a well-trained 
parrot can reproduce articulate and inarticulate sounds. 
This bird possesses 50 to 100 distinctly articulated words 
which can be called out by appropriate stimuli. In addition, 
he sings, whistles, barks, mews, cackles, and laughs. When 
tested on ability to respond in kind to such sounds, he gave 
30 whistling tones to 30 whistling stimuli produced by the 
experimenter’s lips and by blowing a small metal whistle. 
He responded to 31 singing tones from violin, cello, piano,

tling tones. The bird was able to reproduce varied types of 
sounds as is shown in the following table:

Further tests tend to show conclusively that there is 
actual reproduction of vibration frequency. The bird was 
not able to reproduce a given succession of notes (not in 
his repertoire) given by the experimenter. 
Summary.—It will be seen from the above summary 
of the work on imitation that the results are not harmoni- 
ous. Indeed, in some cases two authors working upon the 
same species have arrived at exactly opposite conclusions. 
On the whole, however, enough positive results have been 
obtained to show that in some way the process of learning 
is modified when certain forms of tuition are used. If 
further work were conducted along lines which are not an- 
thropomorphic—if the experimenters would confine their

work to determining just what the animals do without 
being concerned about the fact that they may be acting 
as human beings would under similar cireumstances—the 
control of behavior by such methods in both human and 
animal work would more ‘speedily be realized.

IntroductionFrom time to time there loom above 
the level of the behaviorist’s horizon reports of individual 
animals or groups of animals that affirm that at last a 
prodigy has been found which possesses something special 
in the way of a behavior equipment. Such animals have 
“never been discovered in the laboratories devoted to the 
study of animal behavior. That the highly gifted animal 
should not thus appear in the laboratories is understand- 
able when one considers that investigations have heretofore 
been rather narrowly concerned with the instincts and the 
sensory and motor habits which appear in a laboratory 
environment. ‘The gifted animal has usually been de- 
veloped by the amateur. Through the animal’s contact 
with its owner and with other animals there arise highly 
complex modes of response. The training methods are not 
controlled and no scientific attempts are made to analyze 
the exact nature of the stimulus to which the animal re- 
sponds. From an anthropomorphic standpoint the animal 
apparent'y is reacting as a human being would act under 
the same circumstances. In a short time the doings of the 
animal get noised abroad and it becomes necessary for 
some trained investigator to step in and reduce the chaos 
to some semblance of order (interpretation of acts where 
there is ignorance of training methods is not an easy 
task). Within recent years several animals have appeared 
which have caused a certain amount of consternation among 
297
-P-A-G-E-312
  
298 THE LIMITS OF TRAINING IN ANIMALS 
investigators who have gone to examine into the phenomena. 
The situation is exceedingly like that which appears in the 
investigation of so-called oecult phenomena.t Some new 
medium arises. Some prominent man visits the medium 
and becomes mystified. A scientific man, usually a 
physicist, is selected to investigate her. The physicist re- 
ports an elaborate series of tests which shows that the 
medium is not using concealed wires, magnets, mirrors, or 
other physical equipment. The physicist himself may be- 
come ‘‘ convinced.’’ The mystery grows. Finally the 
psychologist makes the test and finds some simple trick 
which will account for the phenomenon. The number of 
such alleged occult phenomena from telepathy to spiritual- 
istic converse, which have been investigated and found want- 
ing in scientific or philosophical interest, has been so nu- 
merous that now it is very difficult to get a psychologist who 
values his reputation to-undertake such an investigation. 
In the same way, when a wonderful animal appears, 
zodlogists, botanists, and physiologists are hastened to the 
scene. A commission is appointed and the mystery deep- 
ens. Usually when some man who is familiar with the 
methods of training animals and with animals’ methods 
of responding is found, the explanation, while not neces- 
sarily simple, smacks not at all of the mysterious. This 
situation in the past, with regard to the animal world, has 
not been wholly without beneficial effect. In the first 
place, it has brought the behaviorist face to face with the 
fact that there may be depths in the animal to which he 
has not descended and cannot descend except by adopting 
a part, at least, of the technique of the amateur, viz., that 
of living a large part of his time with the animal and com- 
plicating the methods of training (as is done for the child). 
That this meritorious effect has been produced is shown 
by the fact that there are investigators in -behavior who 
are willing to devote a large number of years to the study 
of a single animal or at most a small group of such ani- 
mals. The German station on the Canary Isles is a case

Prodigies,” Amer. Jour. Psych,, 1914, p. 1,

  GIFTED ANIMALS 299 
in point. Along with certain biological investigations. will 
go detailed studies on the behavior of the anthropoid apes. 
It is certain that this tendency to specialize on one or at 
most a few animals will become more common. Since the 
higher anthropoids are nearest to man in their equipment 
and since their tenure of life is long under natural condi- 
tions it is to be expected that students will undertake work 
upon them with greater willingness than upon lower 
forms. To do such work effectively there is great need of 
an anthropoid ape station open to American students. The 
second generally good effect the study of the gifted ani- 
mals has had upon the behavior work comes from the fact 
that in making an analysis it is often necessary to under- 
take a study of the sensitivity of their receptors, field of 
vision, limen of sensitivity for moving objects, ete. 
Some gifted animals.—On account of its bearing upon 
the limits to which training in animals may be carried, we 
wish to examine into the behavior of some of the better 
known gifted animals. We shall discuss in order (1) the 
horse, Clever Hans, (2) the horses of Elberfeld, (3) the 
chimpanzee Peter, (4) the talking dog Don, and (5) the 
dog Jasper. In considering their behavior it seems well 
to bear in mind that all behavior, human and animal, is 
analyzable in terms of stimulus and response, and that the 
only difference between man and animal upon this assump- 
tion would be in the complexity of behavior. The funda- 
mental difference between man and animal from our point 
of view lies in the fact that the human being can form 
habits in the throat (and other bodily language habits) ,— 
neglecting his finer sensory-motor equipment. All other 
habits pale into insignificance when contrasted with these. 
While this at present is affirmed on the basis purely of 
theory, we feel that the assumption has a good many 
points in its favor (p. 322). 
Clever Hans.—In 1890 Mr. von Osten, a gentleman of 
Berlin with some mathematical training, noticed what he 
considered remarkable behavior in a horse which he then 
possessed. When that horse died he purchased another 
(1900) and began training him about a year later. This
-P-A-G-E-314
  300 THE LIMITS OF TRAINING IN ANIMALS 
horse, Hans IT, was destined to arouse an enormous amount 
of interest both in popular and in scientific circles. 
Mr. von Osten’s method of instructing the animal was very 
simple. He began by teaching the horse to respond properly to 
the different words for spatial localization, such as left, right, above, 
below, etc. Simple arithmetical problems were next attempted. He 
would place one, two, three, ete., objects upon a table, kneel down 
and take the fore-foot of the animal and make him tap once for 
each object. In a remarkably short time Hans learned to “ count” 
and to perform simple additions and multiplications. But these 
attainments did not satisfy von Osten. He desired to give Hans a 
wider medium for the expression of his talents. Accordingly von 
Osten arranged for him a conventional alphabet. Having mastered 
this the horse was able to read and to answer simple questions. 
At the height of his career Hans showed the following scientific 
accomplishments (summarized from Pfungst): he had mastered the 
cardinal numbers from 1 to 100 and the ordinals to 10. Upon request 
he would count objects of all sorts, the persons present, even to 
distinctions of sex; then hats, umbrellas, and eyeglasses. All forms 
of simple arithmetical problems involving addition, subtraction, mul- 
tiplication, and division. He could do fractions, changing them first 
into decimals. E.g., “How much is 2 %,?” Answer, % (tap- 
ping first the numerator and then the denominator). Or again: “TI 
have a number in mind. I subtract 9 and have 3 as a remainder. 
What is the number?” (12). “What are the factors of 287” 
Whereupon Hans taps consecutively 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. He was able to 
read German readily, whether written or printed. If a series of 
placards with written words was placed before the horse he would 
step up and point with his nose to any of the words required of 
him. With his alphabet he would answer simple questions, e.g.: 
“What is the woman holding in her hand?” Hans spelled without 
hesitation “Schirm” (parasol). Furthermore, his memory was ex- 
cellent. He carried the entire yearly calendar in his head. He 
could give not only the date of each day without having been 
previously taught, but also the date of any day one might mention. 
He could tell the time to the minute. His musical ability was 
especially well developed. He had absolute pitch memory and a 
feeling for intervals. He could analyze compound clangs without 
difficulty, and could inform his experimenters as to what changes 
should be made in a discordant clang in order to produce consonance. 
Naturally Hans’ fame spread and different people visited 
him. These at first were connoisseurs of horses, officers, 
who—astonished—told about Hans’ accomplishments. 
Soon the public at large became interested and von Osten’s 
court-yard became too small to accommodate the curious. 
The newspapers discussed it as the ‘‘ Case of Hans.’’ Vio- 
lent polemics followed between those who believed in the
-P-A-G-E-315
  CLEVER HANS 301 
animal’s intelligence and those who suspected some trick. 
These latter did not agree among themselves,—some talked 
of optical signals, others of acoustical signals, which von 
Osten gave his horse. Others supposed that electrical 
wires placed under the pavement of the court allowed the 
master to communicate secretly with his pupil. Still 
others laid it to telepathy; the N rays (a fad of the 
moment), and to ‘‘ suggestion.”’ 
A scientific commission was appointed, which delivered 
its report on the 12th of September, 1904. It was com- 
posed of Messrs. Stumpf and Nagel, professors of psychol- 
ogy and physiology respectively at the University of Berlin, 
of the director of the Zodlogical Garden, a director of the 
cireus, veterinarians, and cavalry officers. The report de- 
nied the existence of any tricks used by von Osten, for the 
very good reason that the experiments had the same results 
even in his absence. For the rest, the conclusions of the 
commission were entirely negative. It was said merely 
what did not exist, but the answer to the puzzle was not 
revealed. The mystery deepened. Haeckel, who had as- 
sisted at one of the séances, declared for the authenticity 
of the mental activity of the horse. A second commission 
was formed, composed of Stumpf and his students. This 
time one point was seemingly established. Hans could not 
read, calculate, or count unless some one present knew the 
answers. Pfungst established this, indeed, beyond even a 
doubt by putting a series of questions to the horse, the 
answers to which were not known to the questioner. A 
card containing a certain number was picked at random 
by the experimenter and exhibited to the horse in such a 
way that no one could see it (the answer being unknown 
to the experimenter himself). When tested in this way, 
procedure without knowledge, the horse returned only 8% 
of correct responses, whereas he responded with an ac- 
curacy of 98% in those cases where the questioner knew 
the answers. Exactly the same state of affairs was found 
to exist with respect to arithmetical calculations and to 
reading. It will be recalled that reading was accomplished 
by first tapping out the number indicating the horizontal 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  302 THE LIMITS OF TRAINING IN ANIMALS 
row in which the first letter appeared and next the place 
in the row. This complicated procedure had to be repeated 
for each letter in the word. It was found that when the 
questioner was ignorant as to the letter and row, Hans 
never responded correctly. Calculation was tested simi- 
larly. It was found that if von Osten whispered a number 
in the horse’s ear so that no one present could hear, and 
then the questioner similarly gave the horse a number and 
told it to add the two, the answer was wrong 28 times out 
of 31, whereas in a procedure with knowledge the relation 
was 29 right and 2 wrong. Hans could not even count on 
the abacus when the questioner remained in ignorance of 
the number of balls which were pushed aside. The memory 
tests and tests on musical ability (all questions of this 
kind being answered by tapping) all failed to yield correct 
responses in a procedure without knowledge. Taking all 
such tests into consideration showed that where the ques- 
tioner knew the answer 90-100% of the responses were 
correct. When the experimenter was ignorant of the 
answer, only 10% at most of the answers were correct. 
These tests tell us little as to how the experimenter’s knowl- 
edge aided the horse in giving correct responses. Carrying 
the analysis one step farther, Pfungst found that vision 
was necessary for correct response. When the horse was 
perfectly blinded almost no correct responses could be ob- 
tained (only 6% were correct). The final link in unravel- 
ing the ‘‘ mystery ’’ came when Pfungst discovered the 
signs by means of which the horse responded. These sig- 
nals were the minimal movements of the questioner’s head. 
“* As soon as the experimenter had given a problem to the 
horse, he involuntarily bent his head and trunk slightly 
forward and the horse would then put his right foot for- 
ward and begin to tap, without, however, returning it to its 
original position. As soon as the desired number of taps 
were given, the questioner would make a slight upward 
jerk of his head. Thereupon the horse would immediately 
swing his foot in a wide circle, bringing it back to the 
original position. (This movement which, in the follow- 
ing exposition we shall designate as ‘‘ the back step,’’ was 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
    
THE HORSES OF ELBERFELD 303 
never included in the count.) Now after Hans had ceased 
tapping the questioner would raise his head and trunk 
to their normal position. This second, far coarser move- 
ment, was not the signal for the back step, but always 
followed it. But whenever this second movement was 
omitted, Hans, who had already brought back his foot to 
the original position and had thereby put it out of com- 
mission, as it were, would give one more tap with his left 
foot.’’ These minimal movements turned out to be ex- 
ceedingly small (1/5 mm. and upward). If this analysis 
of Pfungst’s is correct the responses of Hans are exactly 
similar to those with which we have long been familiar 
in the laboratory. 
The horses of Elberfeld—Not every one accepted 
Pfungst’s conclusions, yet interest in von Osten and in 
Hans rapidly abated. Von Osten died in 1909. Hans 
was entirely forgotten until Karl Krall’s book appeared 
which raised the question of the completeness of Pfungst’s 
explanation. Mr. Krall, a wealthy and highly respected 
merchant of Elberfeld, having known von Osten and hay- 
ing worked with him during his last years, inherited Hans. 
He states that Hans works well under circumstances 
where it is impossible for him to see his master or to 
distinguish the minimal movements of the questioner. E.g., 
Krall affirms that Hans replies correctly in complete dark- 
ness, or with blinders on that permit him to see only the 
blackboard or the objects about which he is questioned. 
Krall determined to render justice to his old friend by 
proving the truth of von Osten’s contentions. He bought 
two stallions——Muhamed and Zarif,—and began to train 
them. 
According to Krall their progress was, as in the case of Hans, 
astonishingly fast. Moreover, the two horses displayed different 
aptitudes. Muhamed was much quicker at arithmetic. Instruction 
began with this subject with an hour and a half to two hours of 
“study” a day for each animal. At the end of three days they 
could recognize the first numbers, 1, 2, 3 written upon the board, 
and would touch with the muzzle the one called for. At the end 
of ten days Muhamed could count up to 4. Several days later the 
tens were explained to them and they were taught to designate them 
with the left foot, the right being used for the units. On the 14th 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  
304 THE LIMITS OF TRAINING IN ANIMALS 
of November, 1908 (the horses were purchased on November Ist, 
the first lesson beginning on the 2nd), Muhamed performed correctly 
such small additions as 1 + 3, 2+ 5, etc., and also subtractions such 
as 93. He passed to multiplication and division on November 
18th, to fractions and the addition of fractions on the 2lst. In 
December he was taught Frénch and replied equally well to ques- 
tions asked in French or in German. In the following May Muhamed 
could extract square roots and cube roots, and could do sums like the 
following: 
(3x4) + 36 36x 64 
In February, 1909, spelling lessons commenced. Spelling was made 
possible by means of a conventional alphabet (where each letter or 
diphthong is represented by a number between 11 and 66, eg., 11 
would represent e, 22, h, ete.) as follows: 
i 2 3 etc. 
10 
  30 
ig etc. 
The horse spells by tapping with his foot (the tens are tapped 
with the left foot, while the units are tapped with the right foot) 
the number corresponding to the desired letter. By this method 
Zarif, at the end of four months, could spell, in his own fashion, 
words spoken to him which he had never seen written. Below are 
presented some of the different spelling of “ Pferd” as spelled by 
Muhamed and Zarif: 
Muhamed: bfert, bfrt, fiird, fiirt, fert, frt, fiiart, faerd, faert, fiirb, 
fpferd, frrt. piird, pfiirt. ppverd. pfer, pferd, tfert, fed; 
Zarit: bferd, fiired, fferwt, fvert, pfrde, sdfert, pfert, bffet, 
fdaerp, ete.; 
Zucker was spelled zkr, zukr, ziiqr, zuqr. ezukr, suer, szukr, zuikr, 
eukr, zucher zuker. zucher, suqker, etc.; Muhamed spelled his name, 
miiemuaiimt, muahmet, muamiit, ete.; Zarif spelled his, tsarem,  
-P-A-G-E-319
  
THE HORSES OF ELBERFELD 305 
zarif, sfrai, zuarif, zuruf. Finally Mr. Krall, noticing that the 
horses tapped “out of lessons,’ took down their tappings to see 
if he could make anything out of them. Sure enough! While 
the discourse was at times as incomprehensible as the first babblings 
of an infant, nevertheless there were fragments which could be 
understood. One day Krall told Multamed that he was going to 
give him carrots: “fiinuf” (ie., fiinf, 5) replied Muhamed spon- 
taneously. At another time he replied: “iohn, hfr, gbn” (iohann 
hafer geben, John gives oats). Soon he detected genuine conversa- 
tion between the two pupils. One morning when Zarif had shown 
himself lazy his companion was asked: “ Warum war Zarif nicht 
lieb?”? And Muhamed answered: “weil vaul isd” (because he is 
lazy). “And why is he lazy?” “Weil r sagt begin wiil nijd 
wisn” (because he said at the beginning that he didn’t want to 
know anything). 
Notwithstanding the lesson taught by Hans, Krall’s ex- 
aggerated report was received favorably by many distin- 
guished men. Haeckel wrote to Krall: ‘‘ Your careful 
and critical experiments show in a convincing fashion the 
existence of reason in the animal, which I have never 
doubted.’’ On the other hand, Ettlinger attacked Krall’s 
experiments with a great deal of vigor. Professor Dexler, 
in a strongly worded article, declares that ‘‘ Krall’s book 
is a vile blot on our contemporary literature. Born in the 
poisoned atmosphere of humbug and of trickery, it is a 
monument raised to the cult of the beast.’? Argumenta- 
tion, however, is not the method to settle behavior ques- 
tions. Many tests have been made upon the horses but 
none by thoroughly trained investigators of behavior. The 
two reports by Claparéde are probably the most reliable 
we have at present. The first was made in August, 1912; 
the second in April, 1913. The first set of tests is not 
really scientific in character since Krall himself acted 
mainly as questioner, and since even when Claparéde acted 
as questioner adequate controls were not introduced. 
Claparéde’s second set of tests were undertaken in a much 
more critical spirit. 
CLAPAREDE’S EXAMINATION: Results of the first set of observa- 
tions: Zarif was first brought in. Krall showed us (summar- 
ized from Claparéde’s report) that his pupil understood French. He 
wrote on the board (phonetically without the subleties of orthog- 
raphy) fit sero, (the horse made the sign of negation with his 
head, which signified zero in his language), then, Komptii dis (the
-P-A-G-E-320
3806 THE LIMITS OF TRAINING IN ANIMALS 
horse tapped once with his left foot, correct answer). Having 
written 34 he asked the horse to read the number both ways (reply 
34, then 43, right), then to multiply the two figures (3 x 4) 
(reply correct), and then to square the larger of the two figures. - 
That time Zarif made an error and replied 15 instead of 16. When 
asked to correct it he replied 15, then tapped 24. Zwei und zwanzig 
was written on the board. The horse failed twice to read this 
number. Then Krall wrote “adire zu elf” (add it to 11). He 
replied 33. The horse was rewarded for this answer. “ Adire zu 
ein und dreizig” (reply correct). “ Zu viingt troa”’ (phonetic for 23). 
This time the answer was 44 instead of 45. When told to correct 
it Zarif gave 54 (which is the reverse of 45) and on a third trial 
gave 45. Krall wrote on the board “dus” (12). The horse read 
22. “Add 12 and 2.” Reply 24, then 14. Krall wrote on the 
board VA 25 xX Vyy= . The horse replied 24. Krall said it was 
wrong. He repeated 24. Zarif showed signs of embarrassment 
(at least as interpreted by Krall); he dropped his head like a 
shamed school boy. Krall told him that several people were present, 
one of them a professor who was taking notes and putting down 
all the wrong answers. Then the horse began tapping of his own 
accord. Krall put down on the board the numbers he tapped: 14, 
26, 23, 54, 13, 13, 32. Translated the corresponding word is schlprrd. 
What did it mean? Krall said he could not make it out. We quote 
Claparéde: “But it was not hard for me to discover between these 
letters and the letters of my name a striking analogy. Krall said 
it was impossible that Zarif had attempted to spell my name for he 
did not even know it, but in the afternoon he told me that he remem- 
bered having mentioned my name before Zarif while talking to a 
third person. Was it my name which he voluntarily spelled, wishing 
to convey the information that he knows that it is I who is taking 
notes? Cruel enigma! ” In order to end this séance which had lasted 
twenty minutes, Zarif was recalled to his problem (the multiplica- 
tion of square roots) : he gave the correct answer, 35. Then Hiinschen 
was brought in. He resembled an ass, but only externally! Indeed 
with astonishing quickness, considering the fact that he had been 
a pupil only a few months, he did a dozen correct additions of 
numbers of two figures written in a column on a little blackboard 
before him in an inclined position, for he was too little to use the 
board fastened on the wall. For the sum of 23 +124 20 he an- 
swered first 65, then 45, then 55, which is correct. Strange to say 
he corrected himself. He hardly finished one sum before he started 
another. The problem 2 x 32+ 12 brought out a number of wrong 
answers. The order “zweimal drei und dreizig” (2 times 33) 
brought first 86, then 66. During Hiinschen’s exercises, which 
lasted twenty minutes, Krall stood completely behind the animal. 
He did not leave his position except to write the problems on the 
board, which was done in such a manner that no one near by could 
see it. The groom remained perfectly motionless the entire time. 
C. was beside him and watched him closely. He did not detect 
the least sign which could be suspected of being given in correlation 
with Hiinschen’s replies, who had his head lowered, with muzzle 
almost on the board. 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  CLAPAREDE’S TESTS 307 
At last Muhamed was brought in. He is the genius of the group. 
He is much more lively, much wider awake than Zarif. Krall wrote 
upon the board /36 x V49= . Muhamed first answered 52, 
then, when told that that was wrong, 42, which is correct. Krall 
then substituted the + sign for the X sign in the problem. The 
answer was correct, 13. Krall then gave him the following problem: 
( 1296 — y/ 81) x (v 144— y/ 49) 
and went out of the room. Muhamed looked at the problem and 
immediately answered 115, which is wrong. (The hundreds are 
tapped with the right foot, but are given after the tens, which are 
tapped with the left foot. This distinguishes them from the units, 
which are also tapped with the right foot, but which precede the 
tens.) Krall then called to him from without to try it again. He 
tapped 25, then 125 (which is still wrong, the correct answer being 
135). When an answer is wrong Krall prefers not to insist on it, 
and changes the problem, only to return to the original problem 
in a moment. Claparéde was then asked to choose from a large list 
of squared numbers a number for Muhamed to extract the square 
root. He chose at random 64516, the root of which is 254, 
but Muhamed persisted in tapping numbers of only two figures, which 
made us think that he wanted to say something by means of the 
conventional alphabet, which contains only numbers of two figures. 
So these tappings were noted with the following results: rihgvgdhaig. 
It was incomprehensible. He was asked to repeat it. The second 
attempt was: rmigdjg. This was no clearer. But the similarity 
between the two series of letters was too striking to be entirely 
haphazard. But Krall could not unravel it. Muhamed was then 
asked how many syllables were in the word he wished to spell. He 
answered three. “Is the word finished?” “No,” he replied. “ Un- 
fortunately we could get nothing more out of him.” Krall then went - 
back to the two problems which he had not solved and which were 
still written upon the board, and this time, with no difficulty, 
Muhamed replied 135 to the one and 254 to the other, which are 
correct. As a reward he was given three carrots: “How many 
carrots have you eaten?” he was asked. “Three,” he replied. To 
the card y 117649 = Muhamed answered 4, then 13, then 346, then 
347, then 343, which is right. To the card \/ 383161 —he answered 
58, 317, then, after two “bavures,” 619 (right). By “bavures” 
are meant incomplete wrong answers given by the horse,—incomplete 
because Krall, seeing that the number of units is wrong. interrupts 
the horse without letting him go on to the tens and hundreds. 
Upon this last correct answer, the exhibition ended. 
The remaining séances were equally productive of star- 
tling results. It is unnecessary to present them in detail. 
From such a set of tests absolutely nothing can be con- 
cluded, and yet Claparéde, being much under the influence 
of his emotions, devotes many pages to speculations con- 
cerning the analysis of his observations. The results of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
  308 THE LIMITS OF TRAINING IN ANIMALS 
tests made in April of the next year show that Claparéde’s 
attitude has become scientific and critical. We give them 
in some detail. 
Later Tests By CLAPAREDE: On the 26th, 27th, and 28th of 
March, 1913, Claparéde paid another visit to the horses, accompanied 
by Dr. J. de Modzelewski and Dr. Weber-Bauler, both of Geneva. 
Mr. Krall was not at Elberfeld during the first series of tests. 
We give below a rather careful summary of the tests on the various 
horses: 
Tests, ON MorNING OF THE 26TH OF Marcu.—HANSCHEN: During 
the tests on this horse Claparéde, with the two gentlemen named 
above were present. The horse was led in by the groom, Albert, 
who remained in the room. The pony was shown two cards desig- 
nating the number 53. He responded correctly. The digits were 
next transposed, making the number 35. The response was correct. 
Every one then left the room exept Claparéde. Having shufiled a 
series of cards on which numbers were printed he drew out one at 
random and placed it under the eyes of the horse without glancing 
at it himself (procedure “ without knowledge”). The horse tapped 
42, which was wrong, the correct answer being 45. Twice more this 
type of test was repeated. The horse tapped 73 for 25; 53 for 84. 
We have here three wrong answers when the observer tested by the 
procedure “without knowledge.” For the sake of comparison he 
repeated the test, first glancing at the cards (procedure “with 
knowledge”). The results were no better: 52 was given for 33. 
When asked to repeat it he gave 31. The experimenter wrote down 
63; the response was 16. He then wrote 43 on the board: the 
answers were in order, 42, 52, 53, 64. Calculation was next tried: 
34 + 25 was written on the board: the replies in order were, 22, 42, 
73, 66. The horse was next tested with 244 12: responses in order 
were 37, 46, 36, the latter being correct. At this moment the 
assistant came back. He wrote on’ the board 341.25. The horse 
returned 73. After this there followed a long series of tests the 
answers to which were mainly wrong, although now and then a 
correct one would be given. Under such conditions it seemed 
useless to give tests where the experimenter was in ignorance of 
the answers. The horse having tired, he was removed. 
Berto: The blind stallion Berto was next tested. The animal had 
double congenital cataract. The horse had learned speedily by the 
contact method of. training employed with blind human beings. 
It must be remembered that the type of response called for here is 
much simpler than that demanded by the other horses, at least so far 
as the “ reading” of numbers presented through contact is concerned. 
At the end of five lessons, the animal, according to his trainers, 
could add simple numbers, such as 5+ 1 and 5+2. When the 
horse was brought in Claparéde verified the state of the animal’s 
vision. The horse was completely blind. (“Il ne peut y avoir 
aucun doute A cet égard: l’animal n’apercoit pas une carrotte que 
Yon place sous y eux.” It is hoped that Claparéde does not 
mean seriously to affirm that such a test is really crucial: The 
testing of complete blindness in an animal is very difficult. It is  
-P-A-G-E-323
  
LATER TESTS BY CLAPAREDE 309 
doubtful if any physician can determine this surely except in cases 
where complete degeneration of the retina is revealed by skioscopic 
methods.) Berto was quite restless and in order to soothe him 
the groom held the halter. The groom retired during the reply of 
the horse. In certain tests the groom was not allowed to hold 
the halter even while the question was asked. The groom first 
asked the horse to tap out the following numbers: 2, 14, 42, 33, 40, 
2, and to add 2 and 3 and to multiply 5 x3. Only a part of the 
answers to these questions was right (see appended table). The 
horse was able to give a number traced upon his rump. In view of 
the blindness of the horse, procedure “without knowledge” could 
not easily be undertaken. 
Muuamep: The horse Muhamed was given (by cards) the number 
35. The reply was incoherent. Several of them finished with the 
digit 5, e.g., 15, 25, ete. For 67 he returned 37, then correctly 67: 
for 48 a series of wrong responses with none correct. An exercise in 
spelling was next attempted with complete failure. There was 
incoherence all along the line. Under such conditions it was useless 
to attempt to make tests under rigorous conditions. 
AFTERNOON OF Marcy 261H:—Simple exercises with numbers were 
continued but the results were deplorable. Zarif read very nicely the 
first number Claparéde gave him, but after that one correct response 
nothing further could be obtained in the way of correct responses. 
Two incidental observations were made on the general behavior 
of the horses during the period of response, When one insisted 
that his reply was wrong, once, contrary to his habit, he began to 
watch the groom while tapping, but the response was wrong all the 
same. On another occasion the horse, which ordinarily tapped with 
machine-like precision, hesitated with right foot poised in air before 
beginning the reply. Muhamed was hardly more brilliant than in the 
morning. There were several good responses which were interesting in 
view of the fact that only Claparéde and his colleagues were present. 
The horse read correctly and on the first trial the numbers: 5, 42, 49. 
To the addition 3-4 given on the card he replied 34. All then 
left the room except Claparéde. Several numbers were then presented 
(procedure “ without knowledge”): all responses were wrong. E.g., 
46 was read 44; 43 was read 75; 7 was read 6. To 22415 the 
horse replied 37, which was correct. After that response no further 
correct ones could be obtained regardless of the method of pro- 
cedure. Berto was then brought in. He gave a pretty series, 
Claparéde doing the questioning. He responded correctly to 2x11 
and to 311. When asked to substract 3 from 7 he tapped 10. 
Hiinschen was next brought in. He did not give a single correct 
response. 
AFTERNOON OF MaARcH 27TH: At this session Krall, de Modzelew- 
ski, and Claparéde were present. They examined successively Mu- 
hamed, Zarif, and Hiinschen without getting any correct responses. 
Berto, the blind stallion, alone gave good replies. A recital of these 
would be without interest. The horses replied wrongly even to 
Krall. 
Marcu 28TH, Morninc AND AFTERNOON: Claparéde, de Weimar, 
and Krall were present. Several fruitless attempts were made to get
-P-A-G-E-324
  310. THE LIMITS OF TRAINING IN ANIMALS 
correct responses. Krall advanced as a possible explanation of the 
poorness of the results the fact that the horses were shedding.’ 
Tables of results—From de Modzelewski’s note to 
Claparéde’s report, we copy the following table showing 
the number of correct and incorrect responses returned

-P-A-G-E-325
SUMMARY OF TESTS 311 
As will be seen upon comparison with Pfungst’s work on 
Hans, the percentage of correct responses in Krall’s horses 
is about the same that he obtained by the procedure ‘‘ with- 
out knowledge.’’ How shall we account for the 8-11% of 
correct responses? Surely chance will account for a cer- 
tain percentage. It would be impossible to train horses 
in this way for months to respond to cards and figures 
upon the board without two things appearing: (1) Train- 
ing upon special numbers, cards (of square roots, etc.) 
establishes a set of special simple reactions. It is quite 
probable that many of the combinations (even those sug- 
gested by the outsider) are ones upon which the horse has 
been specially drilled. (2) If the horses really tap in groups 
(numbers?) spontaneously, by the theory of probabilities 
some of the ‘‘ answers ’’ must be right. What lend color 
to such a view are the statements of de Modzelewski to 
the effect (@) that the very simplest problems are answered 
with no greater percentage of accuracy than the more 
difficult ones; and (b) that no matter how simple or how 
difficult the problem is, the horses start mechanically upon 
the answer; and (c), finally, the horses do not even look at 
the letters and figures upon the board. Furthermore, it lies 
well within the bounds of probability that there are cer- 
tain means of rapport between the horse and his questioner 
which may serve the horses of Elberfeld as ‘‘ minimal 
movements ’’ served Hans. We say this without prejudice 
and without any intention of intimating that fraudulent 
means are employed. This would account for the high 
percentage of accuracy which is sometimes obtained by 
Krall. (And since in many cases where positive results 
have been obtained in Krall’s absence the grooms have not 
been excluded, a similar explanation is at hand to account 
for this fact.) On the whole, it seems not improbable that 
we are dealing here with responses which do not rise above 
the level of those given by Hans. 
Peter.—The chimpanzee has always been a favorite sub- 
ject of eulogy. Very few of the highly trained animals 
have come under observation where experimental condi- 
tions could be sufficiently controlled, Several experiments  
-P-A-G-E-326
  312 THE LIMITS OF TRAINING IN ANIMALS 
upon imitation have already been noted on p. 282. Witmer 
has given a report of some observations made upon Peter 
in the Psychological Clinic. Peter’s vaudeville perform- 
ance, which we have several times witnessed, is most im- 
pressive. He skates readily and with accuracy; drinks 
from bottle or glass; lights and smokes a cigarette (some- 
times after a good deal of ‘‘ help ’’ from the trainer) ; 
eats with a fork; and can ‘‘ ring for the waiter.’? Further- 
more, he has varied motor accomplishments ranging from 
the riding of a bicycle to the threading of a needle, and 
from locking and unlocking locks to tying and untying 
knots in a string. 
When Peter entered the clinie Witmer’s secretary bent down and 
he shook hands with her and then kissed the back of her hand. He 
then began to skate around the room in a lively manner and next 
examined a camera, attempting to turn the screws and actually 
manipulating the shutter. The trainer gave him a cork-tipped 
cigarette and offered him a box of matches. The cigarette was put 
into the mouth with the cork end first. He next took a match from 
the box held out to him and struck it on the side of the box. A 
different kind was offered him wrong end first. He at once reversed 
it and put the right end (tube) in his mouth. Peter was able to 
string beads. An incomplete string of beads was held out to him 
and then a bead was taken from a box and strung before his eyes. 
This was twice repeated. Then the box and beads were handed to 
the monkey. He promptly put a bead into his mouth, feeling it 
with his lips and tongue. He then took it from his mouth and 
strung it. One bead after another was taken from the box and 
strung; each was tested with the lips in order to get the hole in 
the middle in the proper position for stringing. When tested on the 
pegging board, after being shown how to put the pegs in, he put 
them in irregularly. The impulse to pull the pegs out was strong but 
was inhibited upon a word from the trainer. The pegs were given to 
him one by one. When tested on the lock which he used in his 
vaudeville performances he locked and unlocked it mechanically. A 
small padlock with a staple attachment was then given him. The 
staple had to be pulled entirely off the lock at the end opposite the 
hole. The key was a small one, difficult to insert and difficult to turn 
after it had been inserted. It was unlocked for him and the staple 
attachment taken out. The staple was put back and locked with 
key withdrawn. Peter reached for the lock, inserted the key, and 
unlocked it more rapidly than the experimenter. When told to put 
the staple back and unlock it, he inserted only one prong of the 
staple. He was told that it was wrong and had his ears boxed by his 
trainer. The lock was taken from him, the staple slowly pulled out 
and moved several inches away, then reinserted. This was repeated 
several times. When tried, he seized the lock, slowly and carefully 
pulled out the staple, then carefully reinserted it and shoved it
-P-A-G-E-327
  THE BEHAVIOR OF PETER 313 
home with a smack of his hand. A small box with a tiny keyhole 
was next given him. The key was on a ring with a large number 
of other different sized keys. It was the smallest one on the ring. 
When handed the ring, he tried first the largest key, then the next 
largest, and then the third largest, ete. The box was then opened 
for him and lumps of sugar shown on the inside. The small key 
was pointed out to him. The box was locked and the bunch of keys 
shaken up and again handed to him. He was unable to pick out 
the smallest key. It was picked out and handed to him. He then 
opened the box with the key and obtained a lump of sugar. He 
failed again on the second trial. A double-headed hammer and 
a piece of board on which were some nails and screws were then given 
to Peter. When the hammer was handed to him he proceeded to 
drive several nails into the board with the proper head of the ham- 
mer. He never mistook a screw for a nail. When given a screw 
instead of a nail, he stuck it into a hole in the board and at once 
selected a screwdriver, paying no attention whatever to the hammer 
lying on the table. The screw was long and wobbled as he turned it. 
He turned the screw always in the right direction. He used both 
hands on the handle instead of employing one hand to steady the 
serew. With the hammer and the nails, he steadied the nail be- 
tween two fingers of his left hand and used the hammer with his 
right. Once he pounded his fingers and instantly put them in his 
mouth. When tested with the form board he showed total inability 
to place the blocks in their proper compartments. He seemed to be 
able to articulate the word “mama.” Witmer states that he did 
this with great effort. His response to words was not tested scien- 
tifically enough to enable us to pass judgment upon his ability in 
this direction. When asked certain questions as: “ Where is mama?” 
“Where is daddy?” “Where is Peter?” “I beg pardon!” “Give 
mama a kiss,” “Give daddy a kiss,” “Give mama a drink,” and so 
on, he did the correct thing, seemingly in response to the words. 
No attempt was made by Witmer to substitute different words with 
the same intonation, ete., and no attempt was made to give the 
words from behind a screen, etc. (See tests on Don and on Jasper, 
below.) 
The behavior of Peter, while described by Witmer 
in a grossly anthropomorphic manner, shows us at once 
that we are dealing with an organism which is far 
more complicated than any horse at Elberfeld. Witmer 
states that he ought to be compared rather with the child. 
Unfortunately neither the behavior of the chimpanzee nor 
that of the child has been subjected to sufficient analysis 
to make comparison feasible. At least two general state- 
ments may be made of the chimpanzee by way of showing 
similarity to and difference from man. In the first place 
his motor development seems capable of being extended 
to a point where in some instances he can actually compete 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
  314 THE LIMITS OF TRAINING IN ANIMALS 
with man, and in the second place his lack of language 
habits puts him forever below the plane of comparison 
with man. 
Don: The analysis of the vocal efforts of Don, “the talking dog,” 
has been undertaken by Piungst. The analysis is of interest only 
by way of the light thrown upon the instinctive sounds which can be 
made by the dog. Don is a German setter about 8 years of age be- 
longing to the royal game warden at Ebers in Gardelegen. © His 
vocabulary is supposed to contain 8 words which may be called out 
when food is present and the following questions given: “ Was heisst 
du?” “Don.” “Was hast du?” “Hunger.” “Was willst du?” 
“Haben haben.” “Was ist das?” “ Kuchen.” “Was bittest du 
dir aus?” “ Ruhe.’ Don was supposed further to answer questions 
by Ja and Nein and to speak the word Haberland. On examination 
it was found that the vocabuiary is given always in order beginning 
with Don and ending with Ruhe. If the order is varied we find him 
calling himself Kuchen and stating that he desires Hunger! The 
first vocal effort sounding like a word was supposed to have been 
haben. This attracted the attention of the owner and thereupon be- 
gan a series of lessons in which Don was fed for correct response. 
‘Ten repetitions some weeks apart sufficed for completing this re- 
sponse. The word Ruhe was supposed to have been uttered first on 
command of the owner’s daughter. It was “ fixed” in the same way. 
It will be seen immediately that there is nothing in the behavior of 
Don which is different, from the standpoint of interpretation, from 
what we find in the parrot. Furthermore, close analysis of even 
the words he speaks shows that they are not true words in the me- 
chanical sense—not all the vowel and consonant sounds being in- 
cluded. Indeed, even the number of syllables is not always constant. 
The dog makes only one vowel sound lying between o and wu. His one 
guttural aspirant is like the German ch and does duty both for k 
and h. There is also a nasal sound lying between n and ng. When 
not prolonged it will pass for das in Don. He does not really make 
the sounds 8, d, k, l, or r. What he really sounds is [(ch) unguo] 
in the word which passes for Hunger.* 
Jasrer: The bull terrier owned by Mr. Dixie Taylor is in many 
ways a remarkable animal, but not nearly so remarkable as his owner 
believes him to be. Jasper has been several times under the observa- 
tion of the author. There are many things in his performance which 
are deserving of a more careful study than we have been able to give 
him. Jasper’s claims to consideration come from his extraordinary 
ability to do certain acts in response to words. Mr. Taylor thinks the 
dog can respond properly to several hundred words, including those 
indicating direction; e.g., up, down, right, left. We have not been. 
able to agree with Mr. Taylor respecting the dog’s ability to go in 
a given direction. In one case in a three-story house we took Jasper 
to the stair-landing on the second floor. Mr. Taylor remained on the 
first floor, completely hidden. The author was alone with the dog. 
The owner then said to the dog, “Go up the stairs, Jasper.” Once 
3Those of us who have seen Don’s performance in this country will surely agree 
with the above analysis of Pfungst, Hl if

  THE BEHAVIOR OF JASPER 315 
he went to the window and looked out (another act he is supposed to 
do on command), once he tried to go below, but the third time he 
found the stairs and started up them. Not many tests were made on 
this point since there were several others which we desired to bring 
out. The most significant act brought out on command was the 
following: Jasper was told to “go into the room and turn over the 
waste-paper basket”; or to “ go into the room and bring the waste- 
paper basket.” When the tests were made in the Hopkins Labora- 
tory Mr. Taylor had first gone into the room and touched the articles. 
We repeated the experiments upon another occasion in which Mr. 
Taylor had never even seen the articles. The commands were given 
by the owner from such a position that the dog could not see him. 
On command the dog would go into the other room and mount the 
table and look out of the window, or he would close the door. On 
command, “Go to the next room and bring me a paper lying on the 
floor,” the dog would go and execute the command. Many common 
objects which are left lying on the floor will be brought in on com- 
mand. When the situation is complicated by laying several objects 
in a row near together, e.g., a handkerchief and a one-dollar bill, the 
dog does not always bring the object designated by the word. Not 
enough tests have been made to give the percentage of correct re- 
sponses when two objects are used, nor to tell the decrease in ac- 
curacy when three or more objects are placed side by side. Two other 
tests were made in the open. After reaching the street Mr. Taylor 
said to Jasper, “Go behind me and put your feet on the bicycle.” The 
bicycle was about 50 feet behind Mr, Taylor. The dog trotted im- 
mediately to it and did as he was told. The command to go down 
the street and put his feet on an automobile (about 100 yards dis- 
tant) was executed with equal readiness. Many other tests of this 
character were made, but they were so poorly controlled that no very 
accurate conclusion can be drawn. For the past 18 months Miss 
Elizabeth Gilman has been training a cocker spaniel of pure breed 
(registered) along these same lines. The dog (now about 20 months 
of age) was purchased a few weeks after birth by the laboratory for 
this special purpose. He is living in the home of Miss Gilman and 
is a great pet. So far, although trained every day upon the execu- 
tion of simple commands, little success has attended Miss Gilman’s 
efforts. This fact has increased our respect for Jasper’s accomplish- 
ments regardless of the possibility that subsequent analysis may 
show that his repertoire of responses to spoken command is much 
more limited than we now believe it to be.*    
Summary.—Unsatisfactory as this chapter is from the 
standpoint of the strictly factual material it presents, 
4Recently the Airedale terrier Rolf, owned by the Moekel family of 
Mannheim, has come into prominence. This dog is supposed to possess 
the same mathematical ability and conversational powers as the horses 
of Krall. No thorough scientific tests have been made upon him. William 
Mackenzie (“Le Probléme du Chien Pensant de. Mannheim,” Archives de 
Psychologie, 1918, XIII, 312) has given a popular presentation of this 
dog’s accomplishments. Claparéde (“A Propos du Chien de Mannheim,” 
J. Larguier des Bancels et Ed. Claparéde, Archives de Psychologie, 1913, 
XIII, 377) has made a_few observations upon Rolf. It seems worth 
while to mention’ that Krall “discovered” the dog of Mannheim.
-P-A-G-E-330
  316 THE LIMITS OF TRAINING IN ANIMALS 
nevertheless it serves to show that the behavior laboratories 
must be prepared to admit that the sympathetic upbring- 
ing of animals in the home where they are thrown into con- 
stant contact with human beings does produce in them a 
certain complex type of behavior for which the laboratory 
concepts, as they now exist, are inadequate to supply ex- 
planation. It is quite obvious that the behaviorist has no 
right to be content until the newly born chimpanzee and 
the newly born child are brought up side by side and sub- 
jected to the same training. At definite intervals stock 
should be taken and the lines of divergence and of parallel 
growth be determined. Such studies can be adequately 
conducted only in a station where the chimpanzee can be 
bred.

Introduction.—We have now considered several forms 
of habit, from the simple ones we find in the rat to the 
more complex ones we find in the chimpanzee. We saw 
that in the former we could, with a measure of success, 
reduce habit to the functioning of a relatively simple set 
of ares. In the complex codrdinations of the higher ani- 
mals we found analysis difficult, yet even in the most 
complicated cases we saw no reason to lose faith in our 
methods. It is probable that a more careful study of such 
acts will enable us ultimately to reduce them to their 
lowest terms and to state the laws of their genesis and 
of their combination. Stated in other words, our science 
does not feel the need of changing its methods and prin- 
ciples in passing from simple forms of behavior to more 
complex ones. It is probably the search for a new prin- 
ciple of explanation that has created so much diversity of 
viewpoint in the study of behavior. Strange to say, it 
has been the biologists and not the psychologists who have 
introduced this confusion, although a great many of the 
psychologists have followed their lead. We find among 
biologists generally the tendency to treat simple reflexes 
and habits in a perfectly objective way, but suddenly 
when the reactions begin to get complex we find them 
introducing the concept of the psychic. It is introduced 
apparently as a deus ex machina to account for complexi$ 
ties in response. Even Loeb has not escaped the tendency.

Certainly his earlier work makes a wide distinction between 
tropism and associative memory. Throughout this work 
we have tried to be consistent. If tropism or reflex is 
the ultimate unit of analysis of behavior in the lower 
vertebrates, it serves the same purpose in the higher or- 
ganisms, including man. No new principle is needed in 
passing from the unicellular organisms to man. As we 
pass from the responses of the simple organisms to the 
more complex ones of the higher animals we find (1) a 
greater number of units, and (2) more complex forms of 
combinations of these units. Jennings has stated that if 
the amceba were the size of an elephant, we should feel 
pretty much about the amceba as we do about the elephant. 
‘We doubt if he means to be taken literally in this matter. 
If we knew as much in proportion about the elephant as 
his studies have revealed about the ameba, the disparity 
in behavior would seem even greater than it does at pres- 
ent. Jennings’ point, though, is well taken, and means 
that the ameeba’s responses are usually very complex when 
carefully scrutinized; probably fully as complex as the 
elephant’s responses appear to be when not closely 
analyzed. (By this we do not mean to affirm that behavior 
becomes complex in proportion to the mass of the animal 
which displays it!) 
Man and animal.—This leads to a consideration of the 
question of the dividing line between the behavior of man 
and that of brute. Hitherto we have not found any pecu- 
liarly subtle differences among the brutes themselves. We 
have found innumerable differences among the different 
phyla with respect to the presence or absence ‘of certain 
types of action systems, in the range of sensitivity of re- 
ceptors, the delicacy of the functioning of these receptors 
(amount of energy of stimulus necessary to arouse them 
to action), in the development, range, combinations, effec- 
tiveness, ete., of the muscular systems. Our studies on 
habit and instinct have brought out such points and con- 
tinued study will make them increasingly apparent. It 
is evident that we find in the primates, at least in rudi- 
mentary form, all types of reactions that we find in man
-P-A-G-E-333
  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 319 
(with one exception, which we shall discuss later), such 
as complex forms of response to complex objects, imitation, 
use of tools, ete. (We say nothing of reasoning since we 
do not admit this as a genuine type of human behavior 
except as a special form of language habit.) Appeal to 
the nervous system yields us no better results. Man has 
neither the greatest absolute brain weight nor the greatest 
brain weight in relation to body length. While it is true 
that the complexity of the convolutions are greater, yet 
many animals have an encephalie surface which is respect- 
ably convoluted (especially the anthropoid apes). It is quite 
improbable that convolution of surface means anything 
per se. It is well within the bounds of possibility that had 
man appeared with a smooth brain three times as large as 
at present but having the same number of conductors and 
the same number of functional connections as at present, 
he would have shown the same superiority over his nearest 
competitor, the anthropoid ape, as he does now. Certainly 
the idea that convolutions mean anything specific in the 
way of differentiation would not arise under such cireum- 
stances. Neurologists have told us faithfully enough that 
convolutions are simply indicative of greater cortical sur- 
face, hence of an increased number of long and short 
reflex arcs. Furthermore, the development of the frontal 
lobe has often been used as another neurological instru- 
ment for sounding the superiority of man over animal. 
It is in this region that Wundt has assumed that the apper- 
ception centers reside. It must be admitted again that the 
increased development of the frontal lobes is a genuine 
fact, but that any special mechanism resides in it, ie., in 
the so-called silent areas, is most improbable. While it is 
generally admitted that complex fiber tracts connect this 
area with the sensory projection centers, with motor 
centers (and more recently admitted) with the basal 
ganglia, this does not furnish any proof that it exerts 
anything special in the way of ‘‘control ’’ over the projec- 
tion centers, as is often assumed in theories of ‘‘ atten- 
tion.’’ Since it was the last brain tissue put on in evolu- 
tion, and is to be found chiefly in man, we have hastened 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  320 MAN AND BEAST 
to assign to its care all those functions in which man is 
thought chiefly to excel the brute. Its presence does un- 
questionably increase the number of neural elements and 
the number of synaptical connections. It is quite thinkable, 
though, that the same effect would have been produced if 
these increased connections had been placed in the parietal 
or occipital lobes or even in the basal ganglia. Of course to 
those who are wedded to the Darwinian theory and who be- 
lieve that simply because we have the tissue it must have a 
life and death significance, this argument will not appeal. 
But as a matter of fact we have always been skeptical of this 
attempt to put ‘‘ something not found elsewhere ”’ in the 
frontal lobes. It is extremely questionable whether (aside 
from its purely motor function) it has anything like the 
significance of the silent areas in the parietal and occipital 
lobes. How, then, shall we account for the notion that 
man is something and has something which the brute is 
not and has not? The feeling that a cataclysmal difference 
exists has been strong through all the centuries, and is as 
firmly fixed in the popular mind today as ever. Among 
scientific men the conviction that the gap is not so wide 
as was formerly supposed is growing; yet we find scien- 
tifically-minded men still searching for the ‘‘ missing 
link.’’? The feeling that a gap exists is shown all through 
the behavior work from studies on ameeba to those on the 
anthropoid ape. This feeling has manifested itself in 
various ways: in the search for (1) imitation, (2) rea- 
soning, and (3) imagery in animals. Since man was sup- 
posed to possess such functions and animals to be lacking 
in these respects, what more natural than to scrutinize 
closely the behavior of animals in order to discover them 
at least in ovo and thus to bridge the gap? We will dis- 
cuss (2) and (3) on p, 333. (1) Imitation we have already 
1E.g., Witmer states: “Speculation has at times arisen concern- 
ing the existence of a ‘missing link’ between the higher apes and 
man. Such a ‘missing link’ ought to present an anatomical form 
intermediate between the highest anthropoid ape and the lowest type 
of man. This gap (italics ours) has been partly filled by the dis- 
covery of the Neanderthal man and the ape-like remains found in 
Java.”
-P-A-G-E-335
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 321 
treated at length on p. 277. If the analysis given there is 
correct, it is clear that the absence of any high degree of 
imitative capacity in the anthropoid ape should not be 
looked upon as any special form of break since apparently 
all that is amiss in the Simie is, on the one hand, too little 
complexity in their codrdinations, and on the other hand, 
too great rigidity in habits once they are formed. The 
differences between man and ape in these respects are 
closely similar to the differences we find along the same 
lines between the ape and the squirrel. 
In thus arguing against a fundamental difference be- 
tween the behavior of man and brute it must not be sup- 
posed that we are trying to support the continuity theory 
of the Darwinians. We have just seen that we have had 
to admit characteristic differences in the receptors and 
action systems in different forms. Historically, however, 
the existence of the ‘‘ break ’’ has been urged most strongly 
in connection with those animals which have bodily struc- 
tures essentially like our own. It has often been said that 
where there is similarity in structure, as an observed fact 
we find similarity in function. When we are observing 
the behavior of animals lower than man we are willing 
enough to abide by our dogma. Yet when we reach man 
we find a certain hesitation in applying it. Logically we 
must apply the principle consistently. If we find man 
doing something which the animal does not do, it is due 
to one of two things: (a) the animal does not possess the 
structure, or (b) he does not possess it in a highly enough 
developed form. If we examine man and animal from the 
standpoint of (a) and (b), we find that there is a differ- 
ence in structure which at once accounts for the popular 
and the scientific feeling that a break exists between man 
and animal. We refer to the lack of well-developed speech 
mechanisms in animals and to the consequent lack of 
language habits. So far no language habits have ever been 
found in animals, nor has any one succeeded in developing 
such habits in them. 
The lack of language habits forever differentiates 
brute from man.—In taking the position that the chief 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  
322 MAN AND BEAST 
difference between the behavior of man and animals flows 
out of man’s ability to form language habits, we shall 
neglect the plainly observable difference in man’s more 
finished use of the skeletal muscles and in the greater 
delicacy of his receptors, ete. It is possible, however, easily 
to overrate these differences. In many cases it is clearly 
observable that the difference between Peter’s motor and 
sensory equipment and that of the guinea pig is probably 
more marked than that between Peter and the ordinary 
man. In taking this position we hasten to add that it is 
not fair to us to suppose that we believe that the putting 
on of simple language habits in the gibbon, e.g., would 
make him a fit subject to compete with a cultured Euro- 
pean from the standpoint of complexity of behavior. We 
do mean that if we could establish in the anthropoid even 
a primitive language and were then to compare him with 
the primitive Australian bushman, we should at once lose 
the feeling that there is some qualitative difference between 
his behavior and our own, i.e., we should lose the feeling at 
once that he is a brute. 
Instinctive basis of language.—In the general discus- 
sion of habit on p. 186 we spoke of the fact that before 
habit can be formed the stimulus must call out a large 
group of reflexes. Unless the stimulus does this no 
habit can arise. Examination of the child shows that 
such reflexes are early called out with such abundance 
as to foreshadow the fact that the speech mechanism is 
eminently suitable to the formation of habits. The 
stimuli which may lead to these reflex movements in the 
vocal apparatus are exceedingly varied. Stimulation of 
any appropriate receptive surface by bright objects, oft 
reacted to objects, as the face of nurse and mother, sound 
of the human voice, loud noises, ete., will call them out. In 
addition to these random reflex movements, we have in 
the case of the throat mechanism something similar to that 
which we found in the general bodily mechanism, viz., 
there exist rather distinct concatenations of reflexes which 
we designate as instinctive cries and sounds. These in 
mammals at least are racially typical and must be con-
-P-A-G-E-337
INSTINCTIVE BASIS OF LANGUAGE 323 
sidered definite instincts. These instinctive acts, executed 
with the vocal apparatus, have, just as is the case with 
instinctive acts executed with the trunk, arm, and leg 
muscles, more or less definite stimuli which call them forth 
(e.g., the mouse calling out certain responses in the cat). 
The animals, as a rule, possess a fairly definite and fixed 
group of these. This has given rise to the misguided 
efforts of Garner and others to show that the primates 
have a language. What the primates have is a much 
larger number of such vocal instincts than the other 
mammals, and a much larger number of stimuli can call 
them out, e.g., injury to bodily tissue calls out one group; 
hunger calls out a certain group; sex stimuli (mate, etc.) 
another; and similarly, cold, swiftly moving objects, tones, 
strange animals, call out others. When attachments are 
formed between the female and her offspring, another 
large group is called into action. There is no evi- 
dence to show in the case of mammals that these vocal 
instincts are modified by the sounds of other animals. 
We have brought up dogs, rats, guinea pigs, rhesus mon- 
keys, Cebus, ete., in the same room. We have shown 
elsewhere that although songs and call notes develop in a 
bird reared in isolation, they are not necessarily the ones 
that would have developed had the bird been reared with 
the adults of its own or of a different species. These 
throat habits may be cultivated to such an extent in birds 
that we may get an approximation, more or less complete, 
to a few such habits possessed by the human being. Such 
throat habits, however, are not language habits, as will be 
clear from our later discussion. It is pretty clear that 
the mutant man, when thrown off from the primate 
stock, sprang forth with a vocal apparatus different from 
that of the parent stock, and possessing abundant richness 
in reflexes, even far surpassing that found in the bird. It 
is interesting to observe too in this connection that within 
the narrow space occupied by the vocal apparatus we have 
a system of muscular mechanisms which has within it, 
looking at it now as a whole, the same possibilities of habit 
formation that we find in the remaining portion of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-338
  
324 MAN AND BEAST 
bodily musculature. Once we can establish more definite sys- 
tems of examining the muscular apparatus we can undoubt- 
edly watch the rise and growth of both simple and complex 
language habits, plot their curves, ete., and in every way 
come to look upon that mechanism as we now look upon 
the system of bodily musculature. It is probable that in 
a few years we shall undertake the study of such habits 
from exactly the same standpoint we now employ in studies 
upon the acquisition of skill in the human being. This 
will lead to a clearing up of the misunderstanding which 
exists concerning imagery. On p. 18 we denied the neces- 
sity of assuming imagery (1) because there is no way 
of accounting for it on neurophysiological grounds without 
doing violence to our conception of brain physiology, (2) 
for the reason that there is no objective evidence to show 
that it exists, (3) for the reason that we can substitute 
for what it is supposed to do a mechanism which is exactly 
in line with what we have found to exist everywhere else, 
viz., an enormously developed system of language habits. 
From this point of view, all organization, no matter what 
its character, shows directly for what it is worth in the 
appropriate muscles. At present we are told to believe 
that there are two distinct orders of organization, that 
which can be read off by the observer directly in the 
muscles or groups of muscles of his subjects, and that 
which can be read off only by the subject in which the 
movement is taking place. This latter organization con- 
sists of visual, auditory, tactual, ete., copies (substitutes 
for the stimulus which leads to the response of the 
muscles), copies and symbols of various kinds of the move- 
ments themselves (see James’ system of ‘‘ remote cues ’’). 
Furthermore, these images can come and go without show- 
ing necessarily at all in the muscles. On p. 17 we touched 
upon this matter. We wish to enlarge upon the general 
position adopted there. The whole matter can be simpli- 
fied by calling this second type of asserted organization 
thought (imaginal). The position which we have earlier , 
sketched took the ground that imaginal thought needed no 
new principles of explanation and required no different  
-P-A-G-E-339
LANGUAGE HABITS 325 
interpretation in behavior from that of other habits; and 
that if behavior could adequately treat of the overt bodily 
organization, it could, by the same principle, just as ade- 
quately treat of the thought processes. Unfortunately 
language habits have not been studied from the standpoint 
of behavior and we have little data of a positive kind 
which will bear out our assertion. Anna Wyczoikowska 
in her work on the speech mechanisms states that when 
a subject was told to think of a word or sentence, 
there followed a definite movement of the tongue, and 
that sounding the word or sentence within the range of 
the subject also produced a tongue movement. Unfor- 
tunately her work stops far short of showing what we 
believe exists. If it could be shown that the sentence, 
‘* Mary had a little lamb,’’ when spoken in front of the 
subject, produced a very definite form of movement 
(habit), and the same general type of movement followed 
when the subject. was told to think the words (they need 
not be identical in form), the evidence would be favor- 
able. Her records are not treated in this way and too few 
were made on any given subject. Furthermore, no time 
relations are shown. We give (Figs. 56-60) some of the 
curves presented in her paper. Explanatory legends at- 
tached to each will show to what the curves refer. 
The tongue is a poor organ to deal with: we need to get 
some direct way of observing the vocal cords, throat forma- 
tions, ete. It will be extremely difficult to get definite evi- 
dence either for or against the present theory. In the 
section below we shall see that there are forms of language 
habits other than those appearing in the vocal apparatus. 
For this reason it is clear that robbing a man of the 
laryngeal mechanism would not rob him of thought, since 
usually in those cases in which a man has been robbed of 
this apparatus there has been a tumorous or cancerous 
growth that has been slow in its onset, and for this reason 
bodily language habits have grown up. Furthermore, even 
jn cocainizing the vocal apparatus, we do not destroy the 
possibility of throat and laryngeal movement. Only the 
sensory nerve endings in the mucous membranes will be

touched by the cocaine. The deep-lying sensory endings 
of the muscles which are the only essential (sensory) ones 
from our point of view, will not be affected by the cocaine. 
If we could find a case where a man suddenly lost his 
laryngeal apparatus without 
any serious injury to the 
other bodily mechanisms, we 
should have a crucial case. 
From our point of view there 
would be, or ought to be, a 
serious limitation in this 
man’s thought processes. It is 
extremely unlikely that such 
a case will ever occur. We 
have had under consideration 
many methods which might

Wyczoikowska shows one method which, imperfect as it is,
-P-A-G-E-342
  328 MAN AND BEAST 
presents some of the things which we believe to be true in 
every case of thought. Even that unsatisfactory method 
can be refined and made to give facts which will either 
support the argument here presented or else show its un- 
soundness. To advance the argument, which we admit 
is highly speculative, we will suppose that future analysis 
will enable us ultimately to show that every word, syllable, 
and letter, whether spoken or thought, produces a charac- 
teristic form of response which, when recorded, must be 
looked at from the same standpoint which we adopt when 
looking at habits elsewhere. At present we can take a human 
being or an animal and in a shorter or longer time get a 
fairly complete record of his bodily habits, ie., of their 
number, of the accuracy in each, of their complexity, the 
ease with which habits are formed, ete. This does not 
mean that we ever have done this or that we ever will do 
it in any complete way, but there is nothing theoretically 
impossible in the problem.? In the same way we should be 
able to determine man’s language habits, what habits are 
being used at the moment (i.e., what thought processes are 
going on), etc. 
The nature of language habits.—Not all habits formed 
in the vocal cords are true language habits. The parrot 
and many other birds learn to speak and sing words; 
the dog even may possibly form certain vocal habits. 
If we turn to the child we find the genesis of such habits. 
The child begins with certain sounds that are essentially 
instinctive,—‘‘ ma-ma-ma, gu-gu, goo-goo,’’ the guttural or 
velar r (%) is also common, etc., differing slightly in 
different races. His first simple vocal habits depend upon 
the language which surrounds him. For a long time such 
habits in the child do not differ from those formed by the 
? Practically, however, the technical difficulties are very grave 
indeed. On the possibility of recording and reading sounds of the 
human voice, musical instruments, ete.. see the article “ Vocal 
Sounds,” by John Gray M’Kendrick and Albert A. Gray, in Schiifer’s 
Text-Book of Physiology, p. 1206. For a recording device see an 
article by M’Kendrick, ‘Demonstration of an Improved Phono- 
graphic Recorder, and Remarks on the Curves Thereby Obtained,” 
Proceedings of Edinburgh Royal Society, 1895, XXI, p. 194,
-P-A-G-E-343
  LANGUAGE HABITS 329 
‘ parrot. The vocabulary of the ‘‘ parrot stage ’’ in the 
child may be fairly large, consisting of as many as a 
hundred or more words. By the time this stage is reached 
the child is ready to begin the process of forming true 
language habits. Vocal habits do not become language 
habits until they become associated with appropriate 
bodily habits, and even substitutable for these acts. If we 
examine the bodily habits which have been formed prior 
to this time we find that the use of the hands, arms, and 
fingers, organs of locomotion, ete., has been more or less 
perfected, i.e., hundreds of habits of response to objects 
have been formed. The child has learned to respond by 
appropriate acts to its doll, bottle, small boxes, and to 
hundreds of other objects. These habits of response to 
objects are essential to the formation of language habits. 
So far the animal and the child are on the same basis. 
The parrot responds with words to an auditory stimulus, 
or to an intra-organic stimulus (spontaneous words of 
the parrot): that animal can also form habits of opening 
boxes, ete. What, then, constitutes the difference between 
the parrot and the child? They are not different at this 
stage! If we watch the development of the child from this 
point on, however, we find that the next step he takes car- 
ries him to a plane to which no animal has risen. The 
stimulus (object) to which the child often responds, a 
box, e.g., by movements such as opening and closing and 
putting objects into it, may serve to illustrate our argu- 
ment. The nurse, observing that the child reacts with his 
hands, feet, ete., to the box, begins to say ‘‘ bow ’’? when 
the child is handed the box, ‘‘ open bow ’’ when’ the child 
opens it, ‘‘ close box ’’ when he closes it, and ‘‘ put doll in 
box ’’ when that act is executed. This is repeated over and 
over again. In the process of time it comes about that 
without any other stimulus than that of the box which 
originally called out only the bodily habits, he begins to 
say ‘‘ box ’’ when he sees it, ‘‘ open box ’’ when he opens 
it, ete. The visible box now becomes a stimulus capable 
of releasing either the bodily habits or the word habit, 
i.e., development has brought about two things: (1) a 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  330 MAN AND BEAST 
series of functional connections among arcs which run from 
visual receptor to muscles of throat, and (2) a series of al- 
ready earlier connected ares which runs from the same recep- 
tor to the bodily muscles. When the box is presented now, 
which set of arcs will function? Evidently either (1) or (2) 
or both simultaneously. It is at this time that the influence 
of the environment upon shaping the language habits comes 
again clearly to the front. The object meets the child’s 
vision. He runs to it and tries to reach it and says 
“‘box.’’ The box happens to have been put beyond his 
reach. The nurse, seeing the child’s efforts to reach it 
and hearing the word ‘‘ boz,’’ hands it to the child. This 
situation being repeated day in and day out, not only with 
this object but with hundreds of others, brings it about 
that the ares running from receptor to throat muscles offer 
the least resistance so far as concerns the neural impulses 
aroused by the box (frequency, p. 262). Finally the word 
is uttered without the movement of going toward the box 
being executed. There has been a substitution (mechanical 
process) of a language habit for a bodily habit. One other 
step and the process is complete. We found in our studies 
on the maze that every cul de sac represented what we 
might call a simple unit habit. These simple habits when 
perfected arise serially. When learning is complete we 
can put the animal down anywhere in the maze, and after 
a few trial movements the remaining part of the journey 
is executed without a break. Something similar of course 
occurs in all complete systems of bodily habit and in 
language habits as well. Habits are formed of going to 
the box when the arms are full of toys. The child has 
been taught to deposit them there. When his arms are 
laden with toys and no box is there, the word habit arises 
and he ealls ‘‘ box;’’ it is handed to him and he opens it 
and deposits the toys therein. This roughly marks what 
we would call the genesis of a true language habit. The 
expositions of the formation of these simple habits are 
often put in unscientific form, e.g., language is said to be 
social and words arise only in virtue of the fact that 
man is a social being. It probably is perfectly true that
-P-A-G-E-345
  LANGUAGE HABITS 331 
if the child were taken at birth to a desert island and fed 
by the ravens (granting the climate were kindly) that no 
true language habits would be formed. Certainly none 
which would characterize the adult reared under such 
circumstances as belonging to any known nationality. We 
have no objection to saying that language is social in its 
essence, provided we recognize the essentially mechanical 
nature of the formation of such habits. In the same way 
a human being reared in a world in which no monochro- 
matic lights were present would never form habits of 
reacting differently to differently colored objects, the rea- 
son being that no stimulus would be on hand to eall out 
such responses. In the same way no true language habit 
(laryngeal) would be formed by a normal child dwelling 
in a community of deaf mutes. No stimulus would be at 
hand to call out the response in such a way as to force the 
formation of the habit. It is essential to recognize that 
the process of forming the language habit of ‘‘ box ’’ would 
probably advance just as quickly if the ‘‘ Tik Tok Man of 
Oz ’’ were put in as a nurse and his mechanism so arranged 
that he would speak at the right time and move the box in 
the right way at the right time. 
Early predominance of language habits.—It is not our 
purpose to treat the steps by which such habits are de- 
veloped. We are interested simply in the steps by which 
one such habit might arise. The moment the child forms 
the first language habit, he is forever differentiated from 
the beast and henceforth dwells apart in another world. 
He still uses his bodily habits, certainly, but not even a 
stroke of paralysis, paralyzing all other skeletal muscles 
except the laryngeal ones, could rob him of his right to 
be called a human being. 
Forms of language habits.—It is immediately suggested 
that there are many deaf mutes in the world and many 
pathological subjects lacking a sufficiently developed 
throat mechanism for the formation of language habits. 
It would be impossible to enter into any detailed study 
of the various forms which language habits may take. 
We can, however, at least mention some of the principal
-P-A-G-E-346
332 MAN AND BEAST 
forms. We have (1) the typical process sketched above 
where the word either uttered aloud or uttered in silent 
speech (thought) sets up a stimulus which effects a re- 
sponse in the musculature of the arms, legs, trunk, etc., 
or else initiates another word, which may in a similar way 
serve as a stimulus to arouse a bodily habit. This re- 
ciprocal process of bodily acts arousing the (thought) 
word: the word or series of words arousing another act, 
ete., is persisted in during the whole of the waking day 
and, if the psychoanalysts are right, during most of the 
period of sleep. In sleep, however, since the body muscles 
are largely inert, the drama as a whole must be played 
with the larynx as the stage.’ It should be emphazised 
here that in adults the situation (sum of present extra- and 
intra-organie stimuli) determines whether the thought or 
spoken word will serve as the stimulus for a bodily act or 
for another word. In reverie the bodily muscles are re- 
Jaxed and (thought) word initiates (thought) word; at an 
afternoon tea or at a reception where the words or phrases 
are stereotyped, the heard word initiates a series of overtly 
spoken words on a par with the bodily habit of walking. 
When the situation is changed to scenes of action, the em- 
phasis falls again upon the bodily muscles. Strenuous 
objections naturally arise to the viewpoint just expressed. 
It is asked, ‘‘ Do we always think in terms of words? ’’ 
We should certainly reply in the negative. Observation 
shows that we have even short-circuited (substituted for) 
the word system of thought. We find (2) a somewhat 
*It should be a relatively easy matter now to test whether, e.g., 
the related tongue movements are present in sleep. 
*In this connection it will be instructive to glance for a moment 
at the complexity in habit systems with which we have to deal in 
daily life. We may illustrate this in a very easy way by a suitable 
example: before me as I write is a calendar with “Friday, January 
9” upon its face. The habit of tearing off these leaves has been 
forced upon me in past years. The effectors of hand and arm are 
used in this operation. The city bell rings 12 p.m.. I say aloud 
“another day over, it’s January 10!” I glance at the calendar and 
say aloud, “tear off leaf.” Immediately the movement is executed. 
Two stimuli are present simultaneously, both of which act upon 
the same effectors, viz., the intra-organically aroused one (exercise of 
the throat muscles) and the one extra-organically aroused, i.e, by

highly involved system of language habits which, strange 
to say, while formed (as we believe) after vocal language 
habits, have their locus in the general bodily musculature 
such, e.g., as the nod of the yes or no, closing the lids 
slowly for yes, winking, which expresses a whole series of 
words, the shrug of the shoulders, and bodily sets and 
attitudes. These movements are often spoken of as being 
mimetic... But the fact is they have nothing at all to do 
with thought, until by a process of substitution such as we 
have already described they come to function as do words. 
The muscular movements originating in these groups 
can arouse there a stimulus which incites to response, e.g., 
to an extension of the arm, bringing about the removal 
of the leaf of the calendar in our illustration. Since these 
mimetic movements often follow, are reflexly aroused along 
with movements in overt or silent speech, it is perfectly 
natural to suppose that a substitution process could occur 
the spoken word. The reaction must follow equally well if another 
spoke the word (even if I were lacking in a laryngeal language 
apparatus). On the other hand, I may think the words “ Saturday, 
January 10, tear off leaf,” and the act will follow. (It is just at this 
point that the upholders of the image say that you can not only think 
it by silent speech, but that you can also imagine the act and the 
movement will follow. Our contention is that in thought the words 
must be uttered silently before the habitual act arises. See also 
p. 824. Neural activity begins always in a receptor, in this case in 
the vocal cords. What starts movements in the vocal cords? A 
previous movement in the cords or another form of stimulation, 
either intra- or extra-organic). Of course, since the act is habitual 
and was formed prior to the language habit, a word is not necessary 
to initiate the act. If I were blind and had no speech the sound 
of the bell might release the act of extending the hand and tearing 
off the leaf (if I may, by courtesy, be allowed to suppose now that 
the calendar has become one of the raised letter type). Finally the 
act might follow in the absence of the bell. If I were a blind 
deaf mute and happened to feel my watch at 12, I might be led to 
extend my hand and arm and tear off the leaf. It is clear that if a 
suitable stimulus is at hand, the act of the hand and arm follows. 
Now this stimulus cam have its origin in any receptor (or in any 
muscle, considering them now as receptors). We have found such a 
group of receptors to be the throat muscles themselves, i.e., the 
movement of these muscles, as in the silent speaking of the word, 
will initiate the impulse which drives the muscles of the arms and 
hands. All such processes are at bottom really identical in nature,

by which they would come to function independently of 
the word. Of (3) writing habits, (4) deaf and dumb 
sign language, and (5) formation of words on lips we say 
nothing, since the processes involved here are all essen- 
tially upon the same plane. 
Futility of searching for reasoning, imagery, and the 
like in animals.—F rom our point of view it can readily be 
understood that the search for reasoning, imagery, etc., in 
animals must forever remain futile, since such processes 
are dependent upon language or upon a set of similarly 
functioning bodily habits put on after language habits. 
Division of labor between human and animal behav- 
iorists.—If the highly speculative position we have tenta- 
tively put forth here represents in any measure the true 
state of the case, it would seem that the field of behavior 
could be divided largely among three groups of investi- 
gators: (1) a group interested in the instincts, sensory and 
motor habits of animals below man, (2) another group 
interested in the same type of problems in the human being, 
and finally (3) a group interested mainly in the language 
habits of the human being and in the possible development 
of such habits in the anthropoids.

Introduction.—Very little of the early work on the re- 
sponses of vertebrates to light was conducted with sufficient 
care to give reliable results. This is especially true where 
monochromatic lights have been used as the specific stimuli. 
In reading the summary of results given here it must be 
remembered that this department of behavior is a very 
active one and what is said should be considered as por- 
traying only the present conditions of affairs. We have to 
admit that many of the conclusions appearing here are in 
need of confirmation. 
I. Lorrs or Spectra SENSITIVITY AND THE RELATIVE 
Strmunating Errect or DirrerENT REGIONS OF THE 
SPECTRUM 
Mammals.—The majority of mammals tested under ex- 
perimental conditions are insensitive to light of long wave- 
lengths. At least for them such rays have a relatively low

stimulating effect. The following mammals have been 
under observation: The dancing mouse, white rat, hooded 
black and white rat, rabbits, and monkeys. The range at 
the red end cannot be given in terms of wave-length. 
There has been no satisfactory experimentation upon the 
range at the violet end. It is probable that the shorter rays 
of the spectrum have a relatively high stimulating value. 
Tests upon rats and rabbits show that the blue and green 
have a relatively high stimulating value as compared with 
the yellowish-red. 
Birds with day vision—From C. Hess we learn that 
when a light-adapted chick is taken into a dark room and 
placed before grains illuminated by the whole spectrum 
(spectrum of medium intensity) and allowed to peck freely, 
it will begin with the grains illuminated by the red and 
orange rays. It pecks continuously until the blue-green 
region is reached, beyond which point it refuses to peck 
further. A well dark-adapted chick in a spectrum of the 
same intensity will always begin to peck at the grains il- 
luminated by the red; then in order, orange, yellow, green, 
and blue-green. While under these conditions the spec- 
trum is widened at the short end (i.e, while the birds may 
peck further into the green) they still refuse to pick up 
the grains illuminated by the blue and violet rays. The 
behavior of the pigeon under the same conditions is closely 
similar to that of the chick. The range at the red end for 
it is normal, but at the violet end it is even more contracted 
than is the case with the chick. Chicks 48 hours of age 
have the same spectral range as the adults. In a spectrum 
of low intensity they feed first in the region which has the 
highest stimulating value for the human eye. This in the 
chick is shifted somewhat towards the red end. In con- 
nection with the author’s work upon the homing sense he 
has determined the limits of sensitivity at the two ends 
of the spectrum for the dark-adapted (not complete) chick

form, nor does it trace such studies consistently through the va- 
rious phyla. This two-fold selection process is necessitated by the 
volume of the work done and its relatively unsatisfactory nature.

  SPECTRAL RANGE OF CHICK 337 
In this work precaution was taken to eliminate all ex- 
traneous white light. The Nernst lamp was used as the 
source at the red end, whereas the are was used as the 
source at the violet end. The limit at the red end is approxi- 
mately 715. It is probable that if a greater amount of 
time had been taken to determine the limit for the chick 
very accurately, it would have been found to coincide 
with that of the human being, which is ordinarily placed 
at 7604. The limit at the violet end is approximately 
400 “mu, which again is almost the same as that of the 
human eye, 396. In a long series of experiments the 
relative stimulating effect of the different regions of the 
spectrum was determined for the dark-adapted chick in the 
following way: All of the monochromatic bands, the wave- 
lengths of which are shown on the abscissa (Fig. 61), were 
equated in energy. Experiments were begun upon the 
chick with the green, 5504“. By cutting down the in- 
tensity of the light with the Brodhun sector (see descrip- 
tion of whole apparatus on p. 76) a point was reached 
at which the chick could not respond correctly (this can 
be determined accurately since the chick is positive to light 
was conducted under the auspices of the Marine Biological Labora- 
tory of the Carnegie Institution. I am indebted to Dr. Alfred G. 
Mayer and to the Carnegie Institution for permission to use this 
summary and the descriptions and cuts of apparatus shown on 
pp. 64 and 76. 
* A word should be said concerning the state of adaptation: The 
chicks were brought into the dark room in a fairly tightly-woven 
wicker basket. They were left in total darkness for 15 minutes. 
The experimenter then entered the room and turned up a 16-c.p. 
tantalum light, placed 1 meter above the home compartment of the 
animal box. The chicks were taken out and run in the same order 
every day. One chick at a time was placed in the home compart- 
ment; then the light was turned out. A wait of 5 seconds ensued 
and then the door was opened and the animal confronted with the 
stimulus. As soon as the correct response was made the light 
was turned up. The chick ate of the grains for a few seconds. It 
was then driven into the home compartment, when the light was 
again turned out for 5 seconds and the routine repeated. That 
darkness-adaptation was well advanced appears from the fact that 
the point of highest stimulating value for the author’s eye lay at 
520uy. If the threshold had .been taken upon the eye in the 
(approximately) light-adapted state the point under consideration 
would have shifted over to about 580uu to 600uu. 
 
-P-A-G-E-352

and since only one light was used) or else would not leave 
the home box at all. The sector reading which is directly 
proportioned to the energy was noted. When the reaction 
threshold had been satisfactorily determined in this region, 
another wave-length was selected and the same routine 
repeated. We thus obtain the threshold at any given wave- 
length in terms of the sector opening. For purposes of 
comparison, an assistant took the author’s threshold each 
‘ day after the work on the chick had been completed. Care 
was taken to keep adaptation for his eyes the same as for 
that of the chicks. It is clear that the greater the energy 
required by any given monochromatic light to stimulate 
the retina, the less the sensitivity of the retina to that 
ray; ie., the reciprocals of the energy value (1/e where é€ 
equals the energy necessary for stimulation) will, when 
plotted against wave-length, give the usual sensitivity curve. 
In examining the curve it is well to remember that the 
higher the point on the curve is above the base line, the less 
the energy required to produce stimulation. We do not 
know in absolute terms (ergs) the standard energy carried 
by each beam with which we worked, but we do know that 
all had the same initial energy and consequently that the 
final \sector: openings at which the various thresholds were 
obtained, are all directly comparable and proportional to 
the absolute energy required for stimulation. Hence it is 
legitimate for“us to take the reciprocals of the sector open- 
ings. Below we give a table showing the actual sector open- 
ings for chick and man, and the reciprocals of those values.

It follows from these experiments that the chick is not 
blind to blue and violet rays. On the contrary, these rays 
are highly efficient in stimulating effect. In general the 
sensitivity curve for chick and man are strikingly alike. 
The absolute threshold for man is lower than that of the 
chick except in the extreme red.

retin, and especially birds with twilight vision, have been 
under laboratory observation. Among these are the kestrel 
(a bird similar to our sparrow hawk), house hawk, small 
owls, and the horned owls. <A bright-adapted kestrel, 
according to Hess, has a range in the red coextensive 
with that of man. Its range is short at the violet 
end. A dark-adapted kestrel has a somewhat wider range 
at the violet end than the light-adapted animal. But 
even a dark-adapted animal responds to food stimuli less 
accurately and quickly in the blue and violet regions than 
in the red and yellow. When the kestrel and the chick are 
tested together simultaneously, the one with bits of veal 
and the other with grains illuminated by the whole spec- 
trum, it is found that each will eat the food from the red 
to the green, but the kestrel will find the food further along 
in the green than the chick. When tested with food il- 
luminated by blue and red ray filters it was found that the 
kestrel rarely ever touched the food illuminated by the 
blue, even after 20 hours of adaptation, unless the blue 
was made very intense. The horned owl has a range both in 
the violet and in the red much more nearly like that of man. 
Even the ow! is slow and clumsy in its movements in blue 
and violet light. The dark-adapted owl eats first in a 
spectrum of weak intensity in the regions offering the great- 
est stimulating effect to the human eye. 
Hess’ absorption theory.—It is well known that the 
chick and most other day birds have retin richly supplied 
with cones but lacking in rods. Hence we have in the day 
birds little or no visual purple. Just the reverse is the 
ease with birds possessing twilight vision. Their retine 
abound in rods but contain few cones. In some forms, like 
the owl, cones are almost completely lacking. In the cones 
of the day birds we find red to reddish-orange-colored oil 
globules and similarly in the retinal rods of the birds with 
twilight vision we find orange to greenish-yellow-colored oil 
globules, at times colorless globules. Hess supposes that 
the shortened range in the violet of the birds and other 
forms possessing these oil globules is brought about by the 
physical fact that the short waves are stopped by the
-P-A-G-E-355
  SPECTRAL RANGE IN FISH 341 
globules. This affords the possibility of accounting, on 
physical grounds, for the asserted lack of sensitivity in the 
violet. Our own experiments showing that the spectrum 
is not shortened in the violet for the chick at least tend to 
prove that one of two things must be true: (1) either the 
oil globules do not absorb the short rays as Hess maintains, 
or else (2) the chick’s retina is so sensitive to these rays 
that the loss is compensated for by greater sensitivity. 
In fish—Hess shows that the dark-adapted fish 
(Atherina) collect almost immediately in the neighborhood 
of the yellow-green to green, between the lines E to b. 
That this is the point of highest stimulating value comes out 
clearly from the fact that when the container is shaded one 
ean drive the fish at will towards the red end or towards 
the violet end. This method (p. 69) enables one to test 
sensitivity at the two ends of the spectrum. It is found 
that their range at the red end is shorter than that of the 
human being normal in color vision. This was shown by 
shading all of the spectrum up to orange. As the card is 
moved along the fish advance before it, collecting in the 
light. Long before the human limits are reached in the 
red the fish begin to respond as to darkness: i.e., to swim 
aimlessly under the shadow of the card, out into the red, 
and then into the infra-red—i.e., they cease to collect. In 
general it is found that the common fresh and salt water 
fish collect in the neighborhood of the yellow-green to 
green. The stimulating value of the spectrum decreases 
from this point towards the red end very quickly. The 
stimulating effect is remarkably decreased by the time the 
pure yellow is reached. The orange and the red rays have 
exceedingly little stimulating value. The decrease in stimu- 
lating efficiency is much less apparent as one goes from 
the yellow-green towards the violet. 
In reptiles and amphibia.—The limit at the red end for 
reptiles (turtle) is the same as for man, but their range is 
even more limited at the violet end than that of the chick.® 
* Again in the case of the reptiles Hess falls back upon his ab- 
sorption theory. In the retina of the turtle only cones are present. 
The cones contain reddish-drange oil globules, 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
  
342 VISION 
By methods similar to those we have already considered 
Hess shows that several species of frogs have a range in 
the spectrum coextensive with man’s. This is in agreement 
with the work of Gotch which appeared several years be- 
fore that of Hess.* Gotch showed that in the excised eye 
of the frog the photo-electric responses fail or become ex- 
tremely feeble if the eye is stimulated by infra-red or ultra- 
violet rays. It follows from this that the range of light 
vibrations within which the frog’s eyeball gives definite 
photo-electric changes corresponds very closely to the 
range which produces visual response in the human being. 
The point of greatest stimulating value (spectrum of low 
intensity) for dark-adapted amphibia is in the neighbor- 
hood of the yellow-green to green. This point can be made 
to shift for amphibia as for birds by changing the animal’s 
state of adaptation and by increasing or decreasing the in- 
tensity of the spectrum, ie., here also a Purkinje effect 
is demonstrable (Hess). 
II. Darxness-ApAptation; WuitTE Ligut 
Introduction.—The current view in sensory physiology 
holds that darkness-adaptation is connected with the ac- 
cumulation of visual purple which takes place while the 
eye is undergoing adaptation to darkness. Two phenomena 
have been urged in support of this theory: (1) The as- 
serted lack of adaptive increase in sensitivity in foveal 
vision, after adaptation; (2) the supposed fact that birds 
with day vision, whose retine are sparsely supplied with 
rods and consequently contain little visual purple, do not 
possess the power to adapt to darkness. It has been shown 
by Piper and others that the fovea in the human being 
does have the power to adapt to darkness. The work of 
Hess cited below shows conclusively that the course of 
darkness-adaptation in day birds is not very different from 
that found in man or in birds with twilight vision. We 
have not repeated Hess’ work in detail, but of the fact 
that an enormous increase in sensitivity comes with dark- 
° But not mentioned by Hess. 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
DARKNESS-ADAPTATION 343 
ness-adaptation where the chick is the subject there can be 
no question. We have had in sensory physiology to give 
over the attempt to make of the visual purple a photo- 
chemical substance responsible for the general phenomena 
of color; it would seem necessary also to give up the at- 
tempt to connect it with the phenomena of adaptation to 
light. 
Darkness-adaptation in birds with daylight vision.— 
When chicks are bright-adapted for one hour and then 
taken suddenly into a dark room and placed before grains 
of food illuminated by white light passing through an 
Aubert diaphragm (working over.a ground glass disk), a 
very noticeable increase in sensitivity can be shown. If 
the pecking threshold is taken in terms of the Aubert 
diaphragm, it may be shown that chicks cease to peck at 
the points at which the grains become invisible to the 
human observer. E.g., in one test it was shown that im- 
mediately after entrance into the dark room, the light- 
adapted chick ceased to peck when the Aubert diaphragm 
was set at 21 mm. The grains ceased to be visible to the 
human observer at 20 mm. After five minutes’ adaptation, 
the limit for the chick was 9 mm. The grains ceased to be 
visible to the human being at 9 mm. In another case a 
human being, a chick, and a white pigeon were tested 
simultaneously. The subjects were bright-adapted and 
then taken into a dark room. After one hour’s darkness- 
adaptation the limits were taken (in this case with an iris 
diaphragm). The relations may be shown in terms of the 
divisions on the iris diaphragm as follows: 
White pigeon 
Man 
Chick 
In all cases one hour in darkness produces complete 
adaptation. It follows from this that the course of adap- 
tation to white light in day birds is closely similar to that 
in man.’ It is interesting to note that chicks, when long    
7 The increase in sensitivity produced by darkness-adaptation may 
be shown roughly in birds by a very easy experiment. If a chick

dark-adapted, are not blinded by strong light. Small 
grains placed before a dark-adapted chick and then sud- 
denly illuminated by bright sunlight, are picked up readily 
by the birds. Birds and turtles stand in interesting con- 
trast to man in this respect. Man is blinded by strong 
light after darkness-adaptation. Whether this is due to 
the fact that man possesses rods, and hence visual purple, 
is not clear at present. 
In birds with twilight vision.—Tests by Hess upon the 
light-adapted kestrel with the Aubert diaphragm (see above, 
p. 343) show that the animal ceased to eat immediately after 
entrance into the dark room when the Aubert diaphragm 
was set at 40mm. The food ceased to be visible to the human 
observer at 12mm. In,another test with the iris diaphragm 
the limits of visibility for the observer were 7 to 8 mm. (di- 
ameter of opening of iris). After a half hour’s darkness- 
adaptation the kestrel’s limit on successive trials was 74, 
54, and 53; for the human being, even after 5 minutes in 
the dark room, the limit on successive trials was 64, 44, 
and 44; after 10 minutes in darkness, 4}, 4, and 43. On 
other specimens the following course of adaptation was 
obtained :

Human being immediately After After

The range of adaptation to white light in the horned owl 
corresponds a little more closely to that of the human being. 
The bright-adapted owl upon entering the dark room had a 
limit on the Aubert at 24 mm.; the human observer at 
18 mm. After a quarter of an hour in darkness the owl’s 
with one eye blindfolded is light-adapted and then brought sud- 
denly into a dark room and the bandage removed from its eye. it 
will, when placed before a row of grains, take the food on the 
side of the dark-adapted eye,
-P-A-G-E-359
DARKNESS-ADAPTATION 345 
limit was 14 mm., and the human observer’s was also 
14 mm. The owl is not light-shy in the common meaning 
of that term. The animal sees very well in bright light. 
With the possible exception of the owl adaptive increase in 
sensitivity in birds with twilight vision is not greater than 
in the day birds. Under decreasing illumination they seem 
to see much more poorly than the human being. The in- 
crease in sensitivity comes on much more slowly. The 
total range of adaptation is about the same as in man, 
although, with the exception of the owl, the absolute 
threshold is not quite so low. 
In fish—After 10 to 15 minutes darkness-adaptation 
sensitivity to light is increased over one-thousand-fold in 
fish. This adaptive increase is in part physical, due to the 
wandering of the retinal pigment towards the vitreous 
humor under exposure to light. In darkness the pigment 
recedes and clears the retinal elements for the reception 
of the light. In man the pigment is almost stationary. A 
large part of the effect in fish, however, is due to the gen- 
eral physiological processes with which adaptation is con- 
nected (Hess). 
In reptiles and in amphibia.—Reptiles (various species 
of turtles have been mainly worked upon), although pos- 
sessing a retina totally unsupplied with rods, nevertheless 
show a marked increase in sensitivity to light when dark- 
adapted. If a light-adapted animal is placed with its back 
to the apparatus admitting graded white light, it is found 
to be an easy matter to find the limiting intensity at which 
the food will be struck; a dark-adapted animal will strike 
at a piece of moving meat which is invisible to the bright- 
adapted human eye. The course of adaptation is almost 
identical with that of the human eye when the latter is 
covered with a piece of orange glass (to compensate for 
the absorptive effect of the red oil globules). The turtle 
responds to objects surprisingly well in very high illumi- 
nation. The process of adaptation in the amphibian eye 
(frogs of various species) seems to follow closely that of 
the human eye. But the absolute increase in adaptive sen- 
sitivity seems to be somewhat less, An interesting way
-P-A-G-E-360
346 VISION 
to test the process of light-adaptation in such animals is 
for the observer to light-adapt only one eye. This eye is 
kept in the bright light for the same length of time that 
the subject’s eyes are light-adapted. Then when the animal 
is taken into the dark room the experimenter, with his 
dark-adapted eye, can arrange the apparatus, while with his 
light-adapted eye he can test the course of adaptation in 
himself and compare it directly with that of the animal 
under observation (Hess). 
III. Darxkness-ApApTaTion: Monocuromatic Licut 
In birds.—Chicks are somewhat similar to man and 
reptiles in the range of adaptive increase in sensitivity to 
monochromatic light. On account of the presence of the 
oil globules in the retine of the chick man needs, as in 
testing reptiles, to put an orange-colored glass before the 
eye when examining the course of adaptation. When man 
and chick are tested under these conditions, close similarity 
in the course and the range of adaptive increase can be 
noted between them from the green region to the red 
(Hess). 
In reptiles and in amphibia—The course of adaptation 
to monochromatic light in reptiles is similar to that in the 
chick. In an actual experiment, where food was illumi- 
mated by a red ray filter, the intensity of which could be 
altered by moving the lamp behind it, it was found that 
to the bright-adapted human eye the food was just invisible 
when the distance between the lamp and the filter was 8 em. 
The reptiles under these conditions snapped at the food 
with some sureness. After one half hour’s darkness-adap- 
tation the food was visible to the human being with the lamp 
17 cm. behind the filter. The turtles, dark-adapted for 
the same period, had their threshold at 17 em. In general 
the course of adaptation is exactly the same in the turtle 
as in the human being when the latter observes the spec- 
trum through an orange-colored glass. This holds until 
the blue is reached, beyond which point the spectrum of the 
turtle does not extend—i.e., has such a high threshold that
-P-A-G-E-361
  SENSITIVITY TO WAVE-LENGTH 347 
comparison between human beings and reptiles is impos- 
sible. Here again, as in day birds, we have animals which 
are lacking in cones, and hence in visual purple, showing 
a considerable range of adaptive sensitivity to monochro- 
matic light. What is still more surprising is the fact that 
these animals are almost exclusively nocturnal. When the 
frog’s eye and the human eye are tested under comparable 
conditions the course of adaptation for the two forms is 
closely similar throughout the range of the spectrum. It 
will be recalled here that the spectrum is not shortened in 
the violet for the amphibian. The range of adaptive in- 
erease for the several amphibians tested was practically 
the same as for man (Hess). 
IV. Sensiriviry To WAVE-LENGTH 
Of mammals.—All of the tests, taken at their face 
value, upon monkeys seem to point to the fact that they 
are sensitive to difference in wave-length. Most of the 
work upon them has been carried out with colored papers 
or colored foodstuffs as stimuli. It was shown several 
years ago that the M. rhesus can learn to respond positively 
to one of a series of colored boxes or glasses, regardless of 
its position in the series. When the rhesus is presented 
simultaneously with bits of food dyed with a given color- 
ing matter and soaked in a solution of quinine, and with 
bits of food dyed with a different coloring matter and left 
free of quinine, it learns with astonishing quickness to select 
only the bits free from quinine. The writer’s own experi- 
ments upon the rhesus and cebus, carried out with mono- 
chromatic light, gave similar evidence of discriminative 
ability. In one animal the habit of responding negatively 
to yellow and positively to blue arose very quickly. Popu- 
lar literature is full of assurances that the dog is sensitive 
to wave-length difference. When tested with colored 
papers, colored metal plates, ete., the results are everywhere 
confirmative of the popular view. The dog can learn to 
bring red, green, yellow, and blue balls upon command, as 
was shown long ago by Nagel. But in such experiments
-P-A-G-E-362
    
348 VISION 
there has been no serious effort to control the various fae- 
tors which must be taken into consideration in every such 
test. The more careful work of Nicolai, using the method 
of Pawlow with ray filters as the source of monochromatic 
light, fails to confirm the view that the dog can respond to 
wave-length difference. The dog, according to Nicolai, 
reacts wholly upon the basis of intensity. Even careful 
tests with colored papers (Smith) show that the dog’s sen- 
sitivity to wave-length difference must be very rudimen- 
tary. Several other mammals have been tested in the 
various laboratories by the colored paper method. Among 
the animals so tested are raccoons, cats, and porcu- 
pines. The porcupine and raccoon strangely enough show 
little ability to respond to colored papers in such a 
way as to indicate sensitivity to wave-length difference. 
The cat has recently been more carefully tested with 
colored papers. It is found that yellow and white of the 
same flicker equivalent have apparently the same stimu- 
lating value; that Bradley standard blue has the same 
value as dark gray cambric. On the other hand, red is not 
reacted to differently from black; whereas green has the 
stimulating value of ‘‘ dark gray.’’ It appears that a gray 
can be found which will break down the adjustment to any 
color (Cole). White rats and mice have been tested exten- 
sively. In tests with colored objects, such as colored 
yarns, papers, ete., they exhibit, as most animals do, the 
ability to form habits which have been interpreted as show- 
ing color sensitivity. More careful experiments upon the 
dancing mouse, where ray filters were used as sources of 
light, failed to give any definite evidences of such sen- 
sitivity. Extensive tests upon albino rats, black and white 
rats, and rabbits with monochromatic light failed to give 
positive evidence of sensitivity to wave-length difference. 
The red-green and yellow-blue habits were formed after a 
large number of trials, but it was shown in the red-green 
habit that the green was the only effective stimulus, the 
animals probably being completely insensitive to the red 
rays. In the yellow-blue habit, while both stimuli were 
effective, it was shown that the yellow was low in stimu-
-P-A-G-E-363
  SENSITIVITY TO WAVE-LENGTH 349 
lating value, and that when the blue was decreased greatly 
in intensity, the habit broke down. The habit likewise dis- 
integrated when white light was substituted for either of 
the monochromatic stimuli (see p. 220). Tests upon the 
rabbit with colored papers show likewise that its responses 
were probably based upon intensity difference. 
Of birds.—When hens are roughly tested by a method 
similar to the one used on human beings suspected of color 
defects but with colored grains instead of colored yarns, 
they pass the test with the ease of the human being normal 
in color vision. We quote the following test from Hess. It 
gives the methods and the results. 
Upon a dead-black tablecloth 15 by 30 em. in diameter he lightly 
fastened yellow-red grains and between these strewed the different 
grays and greens. On the second day the hen avoided not only the 
yellow-red grains, but also the red grains and the bluish-red, and 
pecked only at the grays and greens. This was also the case when 
he strewed red grains among the greens and the grays (although in 
this case the red grains were no longer fastened down). With 
astounding quickness and sureness the animal pecked all the green 
and gray grains lying between the red grains. If there were only a 
few of these at hand it hunted all over the entire cloth between 
the red grains so that after a short interval only the red grains 
remained untouched. If he brought a hen into the dark room to 
a row of white rice grains, strewed upon a black background, and 
colored the grains by means of the spectrum, she here likewise left 
the yellow-red grains untouched. 
He now laid before a so-called red-green blind person (relatively 
yellow sighted, red-green blind) the differently colored yellow-red 
and blue-red grains and let him choose out of the pi'e the grains 
which for him had the same stimulating value. This subject put 
yellow-green with yellow-red, pale blue with bluish-red. The dif- 
ferently colored grains which the hen had differentiated with such 
sureness were similar or alike to the red-green blind subject. A 
hen which had been taught to avoid the red grains was fed on a 
black cloth upon which the green grains were fastened down while 
the red, orange, etc., were scattered loosely about. After a short 
time she refused to take the green grains when these were loosely 
strewn among the others, but did take the red ones. In the 
spectrum she picked the grains lying in the red end as far as they 
were visible to the normal human eye. He concludes that the 
possibility of a red-green blindness in the hens experimented upon 
is excluded, and that greater strength is given to his contention that 
their “visual qualities ” in this respect are similar to or the same as 
a normal man’s. 
K. S. Lashley in an unpublished work finds that when 
the Indian game bantam is tested with spectral light by the 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
350 VISION 
double stimulus method there is good evidence of keen sen- 
sitivity to wave-length difference. There is a rather wide 
literature here also on the ability of birds to pick out 
differently colored papers, glass, foodstuff, ete. While 
these tests in the case of birds probably do indicate sensi- 
tivity to wave-length difference, we are never on safe ground 
in so interpreting them. 
Demonstration of the Purkinje effect—One of the most 
important facts yet demonstrated concerning the sensitivity 
of birds and other animals to wave-length difference is the 
presence of the Purkinje effect. Several investigators of 
animal vision agree, some of them without really proving 
the fact, that the region of greatest stimulating effect shifts 
with the state of adaptation of the animal and with the de- 
crease or increase in the intensity of the spectrum. Hess 
finds that the phenomenon occurs in all of the higher ver- 
tebrates tested with the exception of the fish. Bauer and 
Frisch find it even in fish. While the demonstration of the 
Purkinje effect cannot be taken as the equivalent of a 
demonstration of sensitivity to wave-length, it certainly 
is to be considered as a very positive bit of evidence in 
that direction, if any parallel can be drawn between animal 
and human responses. We have in the case of human beings 
the apparently well supported fact that this effect is present 
in the case of individuals normal in color vision, but en- 
tirely absent in those who are defective in color vision.® 
On account of the theoretical importance attaching to this 
phenomenon, K. S. Lashley undertook to test for its pres- 
ence in some Indian game bantams of pure breed. It will 
be recalled that on p. 339 the author has shown that the 
point of highest stimulating value on the threshold curve 
of the dark-adapted chick lies at 520um. Lashley, in- 
stead of trying to obtain a similar curve for the whole 
spectrum under conditions of light-adaptation, used only 
*It is interesting to note that the presence of the Purkinje 
effect is apparently not dependent upon the presence of visual 
purple. The day birds are almost wholly lacking in rods, and 
hence in visual purple, and yet it can be shown that the point of 
highest stimulating effect in their spectrum is dependent upon 
adaptation.

THE PURKINJE EFFECT 351 
the two bands, red and green (and later yellow and blue- 
green). The chicks were first trainéd to respond to the 
more intense of two white lights. In the preliminary 
training to white light it was shown that when the intensity 
of the white light contrast is great (ratio of 20 to 1) 
and the absolute intensity of both is low, the chick is posi- 
tive to the more intense. When the intensity of both 
lights was raised proportionately the positive tendency 
disappeared. Training was instituted and continued until 
the animal would respond to the more intense light when 
the intensities stood in the ratio of about 3 to 1 (absolute 
intensity was varied from day to day between the limits 
of 5 to 18 candle meters). Red (6504) and green 
(5184) were then equated in energy and allowed to fall 
upon the stimulus plates. By a long series of preliminary 
trials upon thresholds under conditions of light- and dark- 
adaptation, Lashley finally found a certain intensity rela- 
tion at which the shift could be obtained. When the green 
has an intensity of 1/45 the standard (p. 75) and the 
red 1/6, we obtain the following positive responses: 
light-adapted: red 6 ...... green 0 
dark-adapted: ‘‘ 4 ...... nee aeD, 
On repetition several days later, but with energy relations 
slightly different, the following were obtained: 
light-adapted: red 3 ...... green 2 
dark-adapted: ‘‘ 1 ...... feet 
Similar tests were made with yellow (5904) and with 
blue-green (4904). In a similar way it was found that 
when the yellow was cut to 1/22 of the standard energy 
and the bluish-green to 1/90, the dark-adapted chick went 
to the bluish-green 9 times and to the yellow twice; when 
light-adapted, to the yellow 9 times and to the bluish- 
green once. This evidence is not wholly conclusive. The 
number of tests made is small. Nevertheless the results 
seem to show clearly that the stimulating effect of the 
blue-green region is heightened by adaptation to darkness.®

possibility of getting the Purkinje shift with yellow and blue, we

Results from a physiological method of testing for 
color sensitivity——Rouse made some tests several years ago 
upon the effect of colors upon the respiration and circula- 
tion of pigeons. He obtained different types of change in 
these processes depending upon the color which confronted 
the animal. His records so far are not to be depended 
upon, since the light was not in any sense monochromatic 
nor was its energy at all controlled. If it could be shown 
that a white light, within a wide range of intensity, pro- 
duced no marked change in these physiological processes ; 
ie., if the experimenter could stimulate the animal first 
with a white light of 1 c.p and then with one of 2 ¢.p. with- 
out producing a marked disturbance in such processes (or 
if it varied in a fixed way with the increase in intensity), 
while on the other hand if he stimulated them with a red 
and then with a green light, and such disturbance did not 
ensue, then we should have to conclude, after proper con- 
trol, that the wave-length of the light exerts ‘characteristic 
stimulating effect. The presence of such changes would 
again be no demonstration of color sensitivity, but such 
evidence would certainly be supporting.’° A similar set of 
tests should be made upon the pupil, both where the energy 
carried by the different bands is equal and again where 
the energy is proportional to its stimulating effect. 
In fish.—Investigators do not agree as to the presence 
of sensitivity to wave-length difference in the fish. Hess 
give here the complete range of wave-lengths employed in the four 
stimuli:

  ** Babak has recently made some tests on the sensitivity to colored 
lights (filters) of frogs from which the forebrain had been removed. 
The animal to be studied was placed in faint white light for a 
half hour. At the end of this time the normal breathing rate 
was determined. The frog was then subjected to lights of different 
colors and its rate of breathing determined under each condition. 
It was found that very intense green light had little stimulat- 
ing effect, as was also the case with weak red light. A very 
weak violet had, on the contrary, a much greater stimulating 
effect than the most intense green. A beam of white light as 
a whole has less effect than the violet constituent of that beam. 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
  SENSITIVITY TO WAVE-LENGTH 353 
finds that fish have a spectrum shortened at the red end; 
that they seek always, both in dark- and light-adapted 
states, the same part of the spectrum, viz., yellow-green to 
green; i.e., no shift of the point of greatest stimulation is 
produced by the process of adaptation or by changing the 
absolute intensity of the spectrum. They behave in this 
respect as do the totally color-blind human beings who have 
E to b as the brightest point in the spectrum regardless of 
its intensity. The view that fish are without sensitivity 
to wave-length is strengthened by the facts which Hess has 
brought out by other methods. When offered food on 
colored or colorless backgrounds of the same white value as 
the foodstuffs the fish do not respond to it because object 
and background have the same stimulating values. On the 
other hand, nearly every other investigator ™ finds ‘‘ color ’’ 
vision in fish. Bauer, e.g., comes to the astonishing con- 
clusion that fish in the light-adapted state are ‘‘ terrified ”’ 
by red (rotscheu) and hence must have color vision when 
light-adapted. On the other hand, when dark-adapted 
they behave as though color blind. Hess repeated Bauer’s 
work and was unable to find ‘‘ red shyness.’’ Hess had 
no sooner ended the controversy with Bauer than Frisch’s 
work appeared. The latter investigator has recently stated 
that fish (Phozxinus levis) are able to ‘‘ discriminate ’’ red 
from all shades of gray and especially from dark gray and 
black.12 Yellow, green, and blue are likewise ‘‘ dis- 
tinguished ’’ from all shades of gray. Green and blue 
likewise can be distinguished from one another and from 
other colors as well. On the other hand, red is confused 
with yellow. Hess, after the appearance of Frisch’s work, 
retested this species by methods of his own and got only 
negative results. 
Mimicry or adaptation to background no test of color 
sensitivity—Within recent years many experiments have 
been carried out upon mimicry in fish—the tendency for 
many species of fish to appear like the background upon 
which they rest. We have described these changes on 
11 Bentley and Washburn, Reighard, Bauer, Frisch, Goldsmith, ete. 
+2 The honey bee, according to Frisch, is unable to pass this test.
-P-A-G-E-368

p. 124 under the heading of special forms of instinctive 
response. Although Mast, Frisch, and others maintain 
that since the eyes are necessary for this reaction, the fish 
in which such reactions occur must necessarily have color 
vision, it appears to us that these responses do not neces- 
sarily have any bearing whatsoever upon the question of 
color vision as we ordinarily understand that term. Ordi- 
narily we mean when we say that an animal is sensitive to 
difference in wave-length that such stimuli play a réle in 
the adjustment of the animal to food, sexual objects, shelter, 
escape from enemies, etc. Le., that such stimuli initiate 
activity in arcs which end in the striped muscles. It is 
highly probable that the changes in color involved in 
mimicry of this kind are controlled entirely by the sym- 
pathetic system (i.e., through a system of conductors run- 
ning possibly from some special type of terminal in retina 
to nucleus of oculomotor and other motor nuclei, thence 
through white rami to sympathetic ganglia). The recent 
work of Frisch at least brings out the fact that when the 
sympathetic nerves are cut the changes in color fail to ap- 
pear.® We may make our point concerning the lack of bear- 
ing of such changes upon sensitivity to wave-length clearer 
by saying that we can easily conceive of mimicry of this kind 
taking place in an animal whose retina does not contain 
the physico-chemical processes (photo-chemical substances ?) 
necessary to initiate response to differences in wave-length. 
At any rate the burden of proof falls upon those investi- 
gators who hold that adaptation to the color of the back- 
ground necessarily proves that fish are sensitive to wave- 
length difference. 
In reptiles and in amphibia.—No very careful work has 
been undertaken to test the ability of reptiles to react dif- 
ferently to visual objects which differ only in wave-length. 
We have the assertion of Hess that the several species of 
turtles respond to monochromatic light as does the human 
18 Some experiments made a few years ago upon Anolis, the so- 
called Florida chameleon, by Charlton, show that the dark-brown state 
and the pea-green state of that animal are probably induced through 
the action of the sympathetic system. The receptors involved, 
however, in this case lie in the skin instead of in the retina.
-P-A-G-E-369
  SENSITIVITY TO WAVE-LENGTH 355 
being when the latter is tested with an orange glass in front 
of his eyes. This assertion is made upon the basis of experi- 
ments upon the limits of spectral sensitivity and the dis- 
tribution of stimulating effect in the spectrum rather than 
upon any clean-cut control work upon the formation of 
sensory habits. Much the same may be said of the work 
which has been done upon amphibians. Hess tells us that 
the Purkinje effect exists in both reptiles and amphibia. 
But notwithstanding the enormous output from Hess’ 
laboratory it must be evident even to the casual reader that 
his results are very superficial in character and leave the 
- problems almost in statu quo. The important results ob- 
tained by Gotch upon R. temporaria several years ago have 
been taken as the equivalent of a demonstration of color 
vision. Gotch showed, by taking the time-relations of the 
photo-electric change in the retina, that there are three 
fundamentally different types of response to colored light: 
(1) the response to red light is characterized by a long 
latency of nearly 3/10 second and by its attaining to a 
considerable maximum, averaging about .0004 volt; (2) to 
green light by the same short latency as that found in the 
response to white light, i.e., less than 2/10 second; it is 
also characterized by its magnitude, the maximum reached 
averaging over .0005 volt; (3) the response to violet light 
is characterized by a latency longer than that of the green 
but shorter than that of the red (25/100 seconds) ; also by 
very low intensity, the maximum averaging .00024 volt. We 
do not see how these results can be interpreted at all until 
we can carry out the same experiment upon a form in which 
by other methods color sensitivity has been shown to be lack- 
ing. It lies well within the bounds of possibility that an ex- 
cised human eye, from an individual lacking totally in color 
sensitivity, would yield the same three temporal relations in 
the photo-electric change and the same differences in poten- 
tial. If we examine the direct or reflex-like responses of 
frogs to monochromatic light we find little which bears upon 
our problem. Such work deals almost altogether with the 
mechanics of orientation to light. We have learned from 
it that under certain conditions of experimentation the frog
-P-A-G-E-370
  356 VISION 
turns away from red light and moves towards blue, and 
that when red light is admitted at one end of the recep- 
tacle that contains the animal, and green light at the 
other, the frog moves from the red end to or towards the 
green. When red and yellow light are opposed in the same 
way, movement is from the red to the yellow. When red 
and blue are opposed, movement is immediately towards 
the blue. In such tests there has been little attempt to 
control intensity. Usually filters were employed which cer- 
tainly did not yield monochromatic light. On the whole, 
it seems safe to say that no single crucial test has yet been 
made either upon reptiles or upon amphibia which gives 
positive evidence in support of the view that these forms 
are sensitive to wave-length difference. 
Delicacy of the problems in color sensitivity—As may 
be seen from the above survey, we are far from having a 
satisfactory phylogeny of the color sense. The ideals in 
color experimentation have not been very high. As one 
goes through the literature on color sensitivity one is struck ) 
by the lack of any critical attitude on the part of investi- 
gators. Almost any kind of a response to a colored light 
has been taken as the equivalent of a demonstration of 
color sensitivity. This lack of a critical spirit may be 
due in part possibly to the failure to scrutinize carefully 
the various possibilities of reaction in such stimuli—i.e., the 
number of factors in them which may afford a basis for re- 
action. A colored object, paper, light, ete., is a very com- 
plex stimulus. Whenever a sensory habit is established 
with respect to such stimuli the animal is certainly being 
stimulated by one factor or another, but by which one? 
How can we answer this question until we know a great 
deal more than we do now about the limits of spectral 
sensitivity and the relative stimulating value of the differ- 
ent regions of the spectrum? And by relative stimulating 
effect here we mean both at low (threshold) intensities and 
at ordinary intensities. In the case of the chick we have 
the relative stimulating effect at the threshold but we do 
not know it at any other intensity. The relative stimulat- 
ing effect may be wholly different at high intensities (re-
-P-A-G-E-371
y 
THE PROBLEM OF COLOR SENSITIVITY 357 
gardless of the question whether the animal is normal in its 
color reactions or abnormal). There is a method of ascer- 
taining these relations which we pointed out some years ago. 
It would be possible to start with the threshold intensity of 
red (660s, e.g.) and then gradually to increase the in- 
tensity of another red of exactly the same wave-length until 
the animal could just respond positively to the more in- 
tense, say 70 out of 100 times. We would take this inten- 
sity (in terms of energy) as a new standard and deter- 
mine similarly the next reaction threshold (D.L.). In this 
way we could lay off ten reaction thresholds at 660M. 
The energy value or its reciprocal of the red at this point 
would give us our first point on our new curve. In a simi- 
lar way we would lay off ten such points at each of the 
other wave-lengths (probably three wave-lengths, 660 uy, 
520 wm, and 48044, would give us a good basis for control 
work). The curve obtained would give us the relative 
stimulating effect of different regions of a spectrum at inter- 
mediate intensity. What bearing have such facts upon our 
color work with animals? Those who have worked at all criti- 
eally are willing to admit, when red and green have been 
used, that they have been ignorant in nearly all cases of 
the fundamental fact as to whether the red was actually 
stimulating the animal. The habit would arise just 
as well regardless of whether the (non-sensed) red were the 
positive color or the negative—i.e., an animal stimulated by 
green can learn to respond either negatively or positively 
toit. Similarly when yellow and blue were used as stimuli, 
the blue may have been outside the range of the animal’s 
spectrum at the violet end. Again, after such habits have 
been established experimenters have tried to break them 
down by altering the intensity (also the form, the size, ete.) 
of one or both stimuli. Now such alterations in intensity 
cannot be made except in a very unsatisfactory way until 
we have some clear idea as to the change in the amount 
of energy which it is necessary to make in order to reverse 
the stimulating effect (assuming that the animal is color- 
blind). In order to make our point clearer let us take a 
supposititious case: Suppose we have made the sensitivity 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  358 : VISION 
curve (spectrum of medium intensity) suggested above. 
The energy value at 6604 we will assume to be 400zx 
and at 5204, 20x. The relative stimulating effect is in 
the ratio of 20 to 1. Suppose, further, that we have estab- 
lished such a habit with the green at the energy 20x and 
the red at 200z. We now introduce our ‘‘ controls.’? We 
give the animal a red of greater intensity—a red the energy 
of which is 300z, or one of less intensity, the energy of 
which is 100z. Neither of these would affect the habit. 
Not until we have run the energy of the red up to 400x 
will we have offered the (color-blind) animal two stimuli 
of identical stimulating effect. Nor have we intentionally 
exaggerated the conditions which we suspect exist. To at- 
tempt to control the color responses of animals by substitut- 
ing lighter or darker shades of one of the papers used as a 
stimulus where the possible range in intensity is so limited 
is to attempt the impossible. Furthermore, on account of 
the many possibilities for the entrance of secondary criteria 
where colored paper are employed, such, e.g., as differences 
in the texture of the paper and differences in the ironing of 
the paper, it would seem almost impossible to use such 
stimuli in the behavior laboratories for anything except 
preliminary work. : 
V. RESPONSES TO WHITE LicHT 
Mammals.—Very few of the mammals have been tested 
as regards sensitivity to differences in the intensity of | 
white light. The results in our possession come from rough 
tests made with gray papers and from projected lights 
(Pawlow’s method). Monkeys apparently respond readily 
to one of two gray cards when the difference in ‘‘ bright- 
ness ’’ between them is 9%. They show remarkable readi- 
ness in picking out foodstuffs on the basis of intensity 
difference. When tested in the dark room by standard 
methods the monkey (as is the case with all animals so 
far tested) shows a surprising lack of readiness to form 
sensory habits based upon intensity difference. Careful 
experiments by this method have never been carried very

far. Raccoons apparently respond readily to intensity dif- 
ference: one observer states that only 4% difference in the 
brightness of two grays is necessary to give a basis for 
the rise of a habit. When tested with white and black 
(positive) about 90 trials are necessary to eliminate errors. 
Field observers report that their sense of sight is very deli- 
cate and much depended upon when they are living in the 
wild. Poreupines have been similarly tested and the results 
of such tests show about the same sensitivity to intensity 
difference that we find in the raccoon. Interesting studies 
of a similar kind have been made upon the dog. Nearly 
all of the investigators using the Pawlow method report 
that the conditioned reflexes in the dog arising from optical 
stimulation are dependent upon the intensity of the light. 
Experiments upon the brightness vision of the dancing 
mouse show that it has a certain capacity for forming 
habits based upon intensity difference. In the first place, 
when confronted with black and white cardboards it ex- 
hibits an original and positive tendency to go to the black. 
By training, this tendency can be overcome and the animal 
can be forced to respond positively either to the black or 
to the white cardboard at the will of the experimenter. If 
it is tested with numbers 10 and 20 of the Nendel series of 
grays, it is found that the habit is formed with exceed- 
ing difficulty or not at all. Consequently this difference 
represents, under the conditions of such experimentation, 
the threshold (D.L.). The number of trials required to 
eliminate errors in such habits (175 to 42) has been shown 
to depend upon two factors—the intensity difference be- 
tween the two grays, and the strength of the electric shock 
(see p. 204). More careful tests by the use of reflected 
light show that Weber’s law probably holds. When 5, 30, 
and 80 hefners are chosen as the standard intensities the 
difference must be approximately #5 (ie., a dancer can 
“« discriminate ’’ between 5 and 475 hefners, between 20 and 
18 hefners, and between 80 and 72 hefners). White, gray, 
black, and brown mice show a similar readiness to react 
upon the basis of intensity difference when tested with 
gray cards, yarns, ete, The white rat and the hooded black-

and-white rat require from 500 to 600 trials to perfect the 
habit of responding positively to the brighter of two 
stimulus plates when the plates are illuminated respectively 
by a 2. ¢.p. and a 16 c.p. tungsten (see'p. 206). Some inter- 
esting experiments have been carried out upon the behavior 
of bats when forced to fly in a room thickly strung with 
wires; but since the blind animals miss the wires about as 
often as the normal ones, it seems evident that the reaction 
is effected through some cutaneous receptor (p. 424). The 
bat does respond positively (reflexly) to light at certain 
seasons; so that there is some evidence that vision plays a 
role in their general behavior. 
Birds.—When chicks are tested with Bradley black and 
white cardboards with black as the positive stimulus they 
are found to require a larger number of trials to perfect the 
habit (310 trials) than where white is used as the positive 
stimulus (150 trials). This is to be explained on the 
grounds of the fact that the chick is positive to the more 
intense of two achromatic light stimuli where the absolute © 
intensity of the lights is not great (Breed). Some recent 
tests have been made upon the effect on habit formation 
of varying the strength of the electric shock. The habit 
consisted of learning to respond positively to the darker of 
two stimulus plates. While these experiments deal only 
indirectly with the problem which concerns us here, certain 
facts come out which bear upon the chick’s sensitivity to 
intensity difference. The three separate problems given 
the chick were to go towards the darker of two plates when 
their relative ‘‘ brightness ’’ stood respectively as follows: 
(2) 0: 189) 
(2)" e137, 
(3) 1: 5.1 
These tests were carefully made with an apparatus similar 
to the one described on p. 78. Neglecting here the effect 
of varying the intensity of the electric shock, we find that 
the average number of trials required to learn (1) varied 
from 44 to 16; to learn (2), 105 to 40; to learn (3), 171 
to 53 (Cole). 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
RESPONSE TO WHITE LIGHT 361 
Fish.—We know very little about the fishes’ sensitivity 
to differences in t 
Parker has shown t he intensity of white light stimuli. 
hat certain fresh water forms (Am- 
mocates, Aniblyopsis, etc.) are usually negative to light. 
When their optic ne 
as do normal indivi 
the fish, like that of rves are cut the animals still respond 
duals; thus showing that the skin of 
he frog, is sensitive to light. The tail 
is especially sensitive as contrasted with other bodily areas. 
Strangely enough the skin of marine forms is not sensitive. 
A number of forms 
nerves of which had 
are and sunlight, but (dogfish, killifish, tomcod), the optic 
een cut, were tested with very intense 
no response to the light was forthecom- 
ing. If Hess is right about the lack of sensitivity to wave- 
length difference in t he fish it follows that white light vision 
(intensity, form, size) plays a predominating réle in its re- 
sponse to objects. It is probable that the behavior of the 
fish (in daylight), when placed in currents of water (so- 
called rheotropism), is in part controlled by optical re- 
flexes. As is well known, the fish takes a direction of 
motion against that of the current. It apparently tends 
to keep the same visual field,—i.e., to swim towards a 
stationary visual object. Animals with only one eye react 
as do the normals (Lyon). 
Amphibia and reptiles—Several investigators have 
shown that both the eye and the skin of the frog is sensi- 
tive to light. These investigators have concerned them- 
selves with the mechanics of orientation rather than with 
the range of sensitivity or with the delicacy of the func- 
tioning of the visual mechanism. Torrelle shows that the 
frogs (Rana virescens virescens and R. clamata) are posi- 
tive to light at room temperature (21° C.) and that when 
the temperature is raised to 30° C., the rate of positive re- 
sponse is accelerated. On the other hand, when the tem- 
perature is lowered to 10° C. the response to light is nega- 
tive. Riley shows that they (at least Bufo Americanus Le 
Conte) are negative even at room temperature when the 
light is very intense (from projection lantern, about 
10,000 candle meter). When the eyes and cerebral hemi- 
spheres are removed from the frog (R. pipiens Schrefer)    
-P-A-G-E-376
  362 VISION 
it is found that they are still sensitive to light. Such ani- 
mals after a time turn towards the source of the light and 
finally jump towards it. The time of such reactions, though, 
is greatly increased. It has been shown that this behavior 
is due to the sensitivity of the skin to light (Parker). Di- 
rect stimulation of the neural tissue by light will not 
produce the response. It is interesting to note that frogs 
possessing only one eye orient to light as do normal frogs. 
It has further been shown that when definite objects are 
in the field of vision they are reacted to, whereas the ordi- 
nary photic responses are inhibited (L. J. Cole). We know 
very little about the delicacy with which amphibia and 
reptiles react to intensity difference. Some recent tests 
have shown that the turtle (Chrysemys marginata) is able 
to learn the black-white (cardboard) habit. Four animals 
gave positive results, but one animal showed no improve- 
ment in 220 trials (Casteel). Vision is very important in 
the daily adjustments of the tortoise.'* When land and 
water species of the tortoise are forced to jump from a 
board into a net of black cloth it is found that the time spent 
on the board before jumping is shorter in water species 
than in land species. Total inhibition to jumping, ie., 
failure to crawl from the board and fall off in the allotted 
time (60 minutes), appears at a much less height for the 
purely land species than for the water-land and water 
species. It is quite probable that there are tactual and 
kinesthetic factors here in addition to the visual (Yerkes). 
VI. RESPONSE TO Form AND SizE 
In mammals.—Response of monkeys to form and size 
has so far not been carefully tested. In the ordinary rough 
14 All observers agree that one finds the strongest support for 
the view that moving visual stimuli possess higher stimulating 
value than stationary ones in the responses of amphibia and reptiles. 
Animals belonging to these groups do not as a rule strike even at 
food objects unless such objects are moving. Certain of these 
animals would unquestionably perish from hunger in a cage filled 
with plenty unless precautions were taken to dangle the food in 
front of them until it is struck at,
-P-A-G-E-377
  RESPONSE TO FORM AND SIZE 363 
tests the monkey shows the readiness we should expect in 
picking out a food vessel of given shape from others differ- 
ing in form. Similar rough tests upon size differences yield 
the same results. In the size tests the monkey apparently 
seeks the larger vessels. When tested with designs drawn 
upon cards monkeys failed to show a high order of dis- 
crimination. The writer has made some form tests upon 
the rhesus (spring of 1911). The results were never pub- 
lished because the work could not be completed. The tests 
were made in the dark room with the standard method and 
apparatus. The two monkeys (M. rhesus) tested formed 
the habit of discriminating between a circle and a square 
(equal in area) very slowly; not much more rapidly than 
is found to be the case with some of the lower orders of 
mammals. In fact ‘‘ J,’’ the larger of the two monkeys, 
never became very steady in his response (84%). ‘‘ B,’’ 
on the other hand, after perfecting the habit, could be 
counted upon to run correctly every day (100% for several 
days). Substitution of a square which could be inscribed 
in the standard circle produced no breakdown; nor did 
marked changes in intensity. In the case of ‘‘ B,’’ after 
perfecting the circle-square habit, the hexagon-triangle 
habit arose very rapidly—in about 40 trials. Nor was the 
habit disintegrated by interchanging the apex and base of 
the triangle. Monkeys are able to learn readily to respond 
in a given way or to inhibit response to a given visual sig- 
nal. Thorndike states that their behavior in this respect 
is truly remarkable. In the light of what we now know 
about Hans and other highly trained animals, it is just 
possible that we have here responses based upon a general- 
ized type of behavior on the part of the experimenter. In 
rough tests it is found that the raccoon and porcupine 
easily react to the difference between a circular and a square 
pasteboard ecard, and between two cards differing in size. 
No careful tests with standard methods have been made 
upon their form and size vision. The dog has been exten- 
sively investigated by Orbelli, using Pawlow’s method. 
These tests show apparently that the dog is sensitive to form 
and size, and to differences of shading and form in objects.
-P-A-G-E-378
  
364 VISION 
We cite certain of Orbelli’s conclusions as given in the 
report of Yerkes and Morgulis. 
(1) The intensity of a photic stimulus depends not only upon 
the degree of change in light intensity, but also upon the size of the 
illuminated or shaded area. These two factors may compensate for 
one another. 
(2) Qualitative (it is to be noted that this does not refer to 
color) differences in photic stimuli are determined not only by the 
fluctuations of the intensity of the light, but also by the specific 
grouping of the illuminated and the dark retinal elements (i.e., by 
the form of objects). 
(a) Early in the formation of a reflex the significance of form 
is indefinite and the reflex is determined wholly by the 
appearance of a light or a dark figure. 
(bo) Later the importance of the definite group‘ng of light 
and shadow (form) gradually becomes apparent. This 
specialization in the reflex is developed slowly. 
(ec) It is possible, in a short time, to produce a marked dif- 
ference in the influence of two figures by systematically 
weakening the reflex to the unfamiliar figure and by rein- 
forcing the influence of the familiar figure by the use of 
food. 
(d) Rendering different the influences of a familiar and an 
unfamiliar figure produces conditions which greatly favor 
the improvement of discrimination of the familiar from 
the unfamiliar figure. Under these circumstances un- 
familiar figures retain their independence to a certain 
extent. 
(e) The different effects produced by various figures depend 
not upon quantitative differences (intensity of light), 
but upon qualitative differences, that is, upon the unequal 
or dissimilar grouping of simultaneously stimulated ret- 
inal elements. 
(3) When a difference in the effects of a familiar and an un- 
familiar figure has been established, intensification of light, increase 
in the area of the figure, and repetition of the stimulus do not in- 
crease the effect produced by the unfamiliar figure. 
(4) When a difference in the effects of a familiar and an un- 
familiar figure has been established, and the unfamiliar figure 
produces only a slight effect, its influence may be considerably in- 
creased by the introduction of irrelevant stimuli. 
(5) Moving objects may act upon the eye of the dog as distinct 
stimuli. In this case the direction of movement may determine 
the qualitative difference of stimulation and modify the reaction 
of the dog. 
(a) In the early stages, after a conditioned reflex to move- 
ment has been established, the direction of the movement 
is not important and a familiar direction will have the 
same effect as an unfamiliar direction of movement. 
(6) A distinct difference in the influence of movements vary- 
ing in direction may be produced in a short time (by the
-P-A-G-E-379
  
RESPONSE TO FORM AND SIZE 365 
process of wearing out the reflex to one stimulus by 
repetitions, and of reinforcing the other by giving food 
in connection with the stimulus). 
(c) The differences in the effects of different figures, and of 
movements of various direction, is apparently based upon 
the establishment of a conditioned inhibition. Stimula- 
tion of some regions of the retina establishes among the 
various groups of retinal elements the same sort of rela- 
tion which obtains between the separate receptors of the 
entire organism. 
A long series of tests upon albino rats to test sensitivity 
to difference in form and size has been made. In the first 
place, it was found that the introduction of a slowly moving 
sector in the pathway of one of the light stimuli produced 
no hastening of the habit. One animal formed the vertical- 
horizontal line habit and another the 30 mm.—50 mm. circle 
habit. In testing the threshold for form it was found that 
while two rectangles 20x 30 mm. with their long axes re- 
spectively horizontal and vertical afforded sufficient dif- 
ference in stimulating effect for the rise of a habit, forms 
more widely different (square and circle) did not. Form 
and size vision in the dancer seems to be not so well de- 
veloped as in the rat. Tests on the ability of the dancer 
to form a habit when a star-like figure and a circle were 
used as stimuli failed to give positive results both at high 
intensity and at low intensity. They are attracted to some 
extent by moving objects. The mouse (gray, black, white, 
brown) has equally poorly developed size and form vision. 
In birds.—We may summarize the results of the rough 
early experiments upon birds somewhat as follows: When 
tested with wooden boxes differing in form it is found that 
the English sparrow does not easily react to such differ- 
ences. On the other hand, both the sparrow and the cow- 
bird are able to learn different designs (markings on 
cards). The cowbird is able to distinguish the triangle 
from all the other forms, the sparrow failing in this test. 
The pigeon readily learns to discriminate, apparently by 
vision, the position of a feeding-box placed in a row with 
others (so-called counting experiments). They show 
ability to pick out a given form of box,—triangular, square, 
cylindrical, ete., when all are presented simultaneously. 
 
-P-A-G-E-380

(Porter). Chicks will readily learn to leave rice grains 
untouched and to take wheat grains when the former are 
glued down to the table. After the chicks have perfected 
the habit, one can scatter the rice grains loosely among the 
wheat without their being eaten. If one cuts squares and 
triangles from green peas and places the squares on the top 
of a glass plate and the triangles under the plate the 
chicks readily learn to pick at the squares. When the habit 
is perfected the triangles and squares may be laid side 
by side but only the squares will be eaten (Katz and 
Révész). The scientific results upon reaction to form in 
birds are not altogether harmonious. Bingham, who has 
recently worked over this whole field with chicks as the 
subjects, comes to the conclusion that while the chick 
can apparently respond to the difference in form be- 
tween the circle and the square, and the circle and the 
triangle, when they are equal in area, yet such responses, 
after all, are really nothing more than keen perception 
of size differences. He draws this conclusion from the 
fact that after the chick has learned the circle-triangle 
habit with the base of the triangle down, the habit will dis- 
integrate if the apex is placed down.'® All observers agree 
that the chick is sensitive to size difference even when 
tested by critical methods. In a very carefully controlled 
15 Bingham has raised the whole question as to what is meant 
by form. “Reactions to optical stimuli which have been inter- 
preted by observers as indicating form discriminations are probably 
made on the basis of unequal stimulation of different parts of the 
retina. If local inequality of excitations on the retina be the basis 
of these reactions, then the apparent discrimination of form by 
the chick is, in reality, a keen perception of size differences.” 
Hunter argues that we should not expect the child to discriminate 
forms in the abstract in the sense in which form is used by Bing- 
ham. He states that form discrimination is always “ pattern” 
discrimination. The whole discussion is somewhat academic. It 
marks an attempt to introduce structuralism into behavior. What 
we desire to know is how the animal will react in the presence of 
known and reproducible stimuli when the experimental conditions 
as regards the control of the animal are standard. Nevertheless it 
would be a distinct gain to test for “form” discrimination under 
the conditions which Hunter suggests. His paper should certainly © 
be consulted in planning experiments upon “ pattern” and “ form” 
discrimination.
-P-A-G-E-381
  RESPONSE TO FORM AND SIZE 367 
experiment upon size it has been shown that a standard 
circle (6 cm.) and a cirele lying between 4.5 and 5 cm. 
(slightly larger than 4.5 em. and slightly smaller than 
5 em.) affords a basis for a differential reaction. After 
the chick has been trained to react positively to the larger 
of two circles it will continue to react positively to the larger 
when the absolute size of both has been made proportion- 
ately larger or smaller.1* In regard to the chick’s use of 
size, form, and brightness stimuli, Bingham states that dif- 
ference in size is most potent in determining visual response, 
and next in order come brightness, general illumination, 
and then form. 
In reptiles and in amphibia.—Experiments on the turtle 
(Chrysemys marginata) bring out the fact that the animals 
failed to discriminate between patterns. Two learned to 
discriminate vertical and horizontal lines and 2 between 
2 series of parallel horizontal lines 8 mm. and 2 mm. in 
width respectively. One turtle learned to discriminate be- 
tween 2 series of parallel vertical lines 8 mm. and 1 mm. 
wide, and then between lines 4 mm. and 2 mm. wide, and 
finally between lines 3 mm. and 2 mm. wide. The average 
number of trials necessary to form such habits was 183 
(Casteel). Habits of avoiding certain food objects can 
apparently be established in the frog (as in the monkey) 
in a very few trials. Under the influence of punishment 
by the electric shock Rk. clamata learned to avoid earth- 
worms treated with chemicals in two trials (Schaeffer). 
Just what such results as these really mean it is impossible 
to say.

Introduction.—In the preceding chapter we saw that 
investigators were not wholly in accord as regards the 
results obtained from testing the visual responses of ani- 
mals. In view of the lack of any standardized method for 
testing the responses of animals to auditory stimuli, we 
shall find a still greater lack of harmony in the field of 
audition. The auditory work has been largely done by 
physiologists and zodlogists for the purpose of throwing 
light either upon the localization of function or upon com- 
parative anatomy. Little attention has been given to the 
strictly behavior side of audition—i.e., to the influence of 
audition upon habit formation, the instincts released by 
auditory stimuli, ete. The experiments have been con- 
ducted in such a way that we can do little more than present 
the results of the different investigators. In the discus- 
sion of audition we shall include some experiments which 
have been conducted for the purpose of determining the 
function of the lateral line organs. The functions of the 
semicircular canals and vestibular portions of the ear

THE AUDITORY ORGAN 371 
should naturally appear in this chapter, but since the 
physiologists have from time immemorial included these 
structures in their treatises, we shall not deal with them 
in this sketch. On p. 36 we indicated some of the problems 
which belong in a study of audition in animals. The pres- 
ent summary shows how far from complete are our actual 
data. 
Some structural differences in the auditory organs.— 
The mammalian ear is so well known that it is not necessary 
to enter into a description of its parts. Since Helmholtz 
we have come to look upon the organ of Corti as the 
structure in the inner ear which is essential at least to all 
of our finer reactions to sound. In more recent times 
there has appeared the tendency to regard the tectorial 
membrane as a part of the essential structure. Helmholtz 
at first supposed that the analyzing mechanism of the 
inner ear was the arches of Corti. When C. Haase called 
his attention to the fact that birds do not possess the arches 
of Corti, Helmholtz then assumed that the basilar mem- 
brane fibers were responsible for tonal analysis. Birds 
and all mammals possess a basilar membrane. In birds, 
however, this membrane is shorter than in mammals. And 
although there is no real factual justification it was as- 
sumed by the early zodlogists that the range of pitch sensi- 
tivity in birds was very limited. In the more highly de- 
veloped fishes, although there is no external ear, there is a 
well marked internal ear consisting of an utriculus and its 
semicircular canals, and of a sacculus with its appended 
lagena. We are particularly interested in the lagena, since 
it is the forerunner of the cochlea of birds and mammals. 
In fish (squeteague) the lagena exists as a small triangular 
pocket. A branch of the eighth nerve is distributed to this 
region, ending in a sensory patch called the papilla acustica 
basilaris. This area contains a single otolith, the astericus. 
The sacculus, while communicating freely with the lagena, 
does not communicate (in most forms) with the utriculus 
and its appended semicircular canals (structures which are 
in some way necessary to the maintenance of equilibrium 
+See the excellent summary of Wilson and Pike,
-P-A-G-E-386
  
372 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
and muscular tonicity). The sacculus, like the lagena, 
contains a single sensory patch, the macula acustica sacculi, 
and a single large otolith, the sagitta. It is supposed by 
Parker and others that both the sacculus and the lagena 
function in the reception of sound stimuli, and that these 
organs play no part in the maintenance of equilibrium and 
muscular tonus. Parker further supposes that the sac-

culus is the most important organ in the reception of sound, 
since when the sagitta on each side is pinned down, the 
fish are only feebly sensitive to sound. How the sagitte 
function ‘‘ in the reception of sound is not known with 
certainty ; but since in the squeteague they have a specific 
gravity of 2.84 and that of the whole head is about 1.8, it 
is quite probable that when sound vibrations influence the 
normal fish they induce the relatively lighter parts of the 
head, including the macula acustica sacculi, to vibrate

against the relatively heavier otolith; in other words, the 
otolith is a relatively stable body against which the audi- 
tory hairs of the macula acustica sacculi may strike.’’ 
According to such a view the fish could react to sound 
only on the basis of difference in intensity—there is no 
differentiating or selecting mechanism. In amphibia there 
are both a middle ear and an internal ear. The tympanic 
membrane lies imbedded in the dermal surface. This mem- 
brane is connected with the opening in the inner ear

really two bones—stapes and columella) called the colu-

far more highly developed in the frog than in the fish. 
‘We have in the amphibia, at least, rudimentary basilar and 
tectorial membranes. In birds and in reptiles there is still 
further development in these structures. We find here 
first a true cochlea—with a scala tympana and a scala 
vestibuli clearly marked. The basilar membrane is in- 
creased in length and has become more highly differenti- 
ated. Figs. 62, 63, and 64 show the progressive changes 
in the auditory portions of the ear as we pass from fish, 
through the birds, to mammals.

Avupitory RESPONSES IN MAMMALS 
(a) Dog: Kalischer’s experiments.—Kalischer reported 
in 1907 some experiments upon dogs made for the purpose 
of testing the relation between the temporal cortex and the 
reception of tone stimuli. He wished particularly to test 
the validity of Munk’s conclusion that the center of tone 
lies in the temporal lobe and that the perception of high 
tones is taken care of by the anterior portion of the center, 
while that of the deeper tone depends upon the activity of 
the posterior portion of the center. Kalischer trained his 
dogs so that they would take food at one tone and refrain 
from taking it upon the sounding of all other tones. The 
food was held in the experimenter’s hand or was laid on 
a chair near by the experimenter. The tones were first 
sounded upon an organ which contained nine pipes ranging 
from C, to ¢’. Later he substituted a piano and later
-P-A-G-E-389
KALISCHER’S EXPERIMENTS 375 
still a harmonium, finding the latter better suited to his 
purposes. In training the dogs he sounded at first only the 
food tone so that he might accustom the animals to being 
fed at the sound. ‘‘From about the third day on,’’ says 
Kalischer, ‘‘ I struck now and then another tone and 
closed my hand over the bit of food while this tone was 
sounding.’’? Then he caused the food tone to sound again, 
this time allowing the animal to eat. In a short time 
Kalischer found that the desired habit arose. In his own 
words, he says: ‘‘ From the fifth or sixth day on, even if I 
held the bit of meat in the open hand, many of the animals 
would no longer attempt to seize it when the confusion 
tone was sounded.’’ Some of the animals were taught to 
take food at high tones (¢-2048 d.v.) and others at low 
tones (C-64 d.v.). As may be seen, the confusion tones 
at first were made quite different from the food tone. 
After progress in association had resulted, the confusion 
tones were made to lie nearer and nearer the food tone. He 
says that it was not very difficult to train the animals to re- 
spond differently to two tones when they were only a semi- 
tone apart. In order to control his results, Kalischer made 
the following checks: Some of the dogs were temporarily 
blinded by sewing their eyelids together. He reports that 
the accuracy of response was not affected. This ap- 
parently would rule out the possibility that the dogs were 
reacting to visual clues. Besides this form of control, 
Kalischer destroyed one cochlea in other well-trained dogs. 
No disturbance ensued. But when the other cochlea was 
destroyed the habit broke down. This shows, he thinks, 
that the dog was not reacting to non-auditory stimuli. It 
is perfectly clear that if Kalischer’s control tests were 
accurately made, they were adequate; but from experiments 
which Johnson has carried out (p. 379) the whole matter is 
left in doubt. It is very probable that Kalischer himself 
did not give the customary clues to the dogs after the 
cochlea had been destroyed, since he was not expecting 
them to react. Nevertheless, he himself was convinced that 
his dogs had been trained to react on the basis of the 
difference in pitch between the two tones, He then began
-P-A-G-E-390
376 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
his operative work. The first operation consisted of ex- 
tirpation of one temporal lobe from an animal whose 
cochlea on the same side had previously been destroyed. 
According to Munk, the eighth nerve makes a_per- 
fect crossing and this operation should render the ani- 
mal completely déaf. Kalischer reported that his animal 
reacted to tones as before, no matter whether extirpation 
was partial or complete. Before proceeding to extirpate 
the opposite temporal lobe, Kalischer allowed four or five 
weeks for recovery, during which time he continued train- 
ing the animals. When the second temporal lobe was re- 
moved from some animals, the visual area was also injured. 
After this operation the dogs no longer reacted to spoken 
commands, nor did they show by pricking up the ears or 
by movements of the head any sensitivity to loud noises. 
Later they began to resume such movements at very loud 
noises and at very loud commands, but did not learn to react 
differently to them. Before the operation the least whistle 
or call had been enough to bring forth the appropriate re- 
sponses. Even the movements of the head and ears at noises 
finally disappeared after the destruction of the posterior 
corpora quadrigémina with a needle. The animals’ reactions 
to tone, however, were much less affected. Tests were re- 
sumed three days after the operation. Kalischer says that 
some disturbance of tonal habits followed, but he asserts 
that the animals undoubtedly reacted properly to the 
food tones and kept still on the sounding of the confusion 
tones. He ascribes the disturbance wholly to the shock of 
the operation. After two weeks the animals began to ex- 
hibit the old habits. They snapped in accustomed fashion 
at the food tone and shrank back at the confusion tones. 
They reacted also accurately to chords and discords. It 
was possible even in the most mutilated of these dogs to 
retrain them to react to a new food tone and to inhibit 
reaction to the former one. He concludes, accordingly, that 
the reception of noises and that of tones are mediated by 
different end organs and that different centers are involved 
for each. The center for noise he locates in the temporal 
lobe, the afferent pathway to which passes through the
-P-A-G-E-391
ROTHMAN’S EXPERIMENTS 377 
posterior corpora quadrigemina. The end organ for noise 
reception is indeterminate. On the other hand, he considers 
that the cochlea contains the end organ for tone and that 
the center for tone is infra-cortical and even below the 
posterior corpora quadrigemina, since the only known audi- 
tory pathway to the cortex passes through the quad- 
rigeminal bodies. Kalischer concludes on the behavior 
side that we must attribute to the dog an exceedingly 
fine sensitivity to absolute pitch. 
Rothman’s experiments.—Later Rothman, not satisfied 
with Kalischer’s behavior work, decided to make the same 
type of experiment. His method of training the dogs was 
similar to that of Kalischer except that he allowed an 
assistant to feed the dogs upon the sounding of the food 
tone. After some of the dogs had been trained he made the 
following operation. Both posterior corpora quadrigemina 
were removed on four dogs. Three had been previously 
trained. After the operation he tried to train two of the 
three dogs for about a month to react positively to 
e-1024 d.v. and negatively to the other e’s on the organ, 
but without success. The fourth animal previously trained 
to react only to c-1024 d.v., and which had learned the 
problem faultlessly, was again subjected to the training 
process four weeks after the operation. Three weeks were 
spent in training to the same tone, without success. Then 
for twenty-three days he tried to teach this animal to react 
to the words ‘‘ Mach schén,’’ with the same outcome. From 
Rothman’s brief account one gathers that the animals 
reacted when noises or tones were made, but did not react 
differently to them. Post-mortem showed total destruction 
of the posterior corpora quadrigemina in all animals. Ex- 
tirpation of both temporal lobes in five animals produced 
lack of sensitiveness to both tone and noise when the entire 
area described by Munk was removed. If the removal was 
not complete some trace of the reactions remained. A 
sixth dog, however, not previously trained, having been 
deprived of both temporal lobes and of one convolution of 
the gyrus sylviacus was successfully trained in three weeks 
to respond to one of the tones, From these and other 
 
-P-A-G-E-392
  
378 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
results which we cannot enter into, Rothman concludes 
that the dog’s auditory center lies in the temporal region, 
but extends over a wider area than that defined by Munk. 
According to him the pathway from the end organ passes 
through the posterior corpora quadrigemina and the in- 
terior geniculate bodies.” 
Further experiments by Kalischer.—Kalischer in 1909 
continued his report. A dog was first trained to react in 
one way to a high tone and in another way to a low tone. 
After the habit was perfected one labyrinth was destroyed, 
making the animal wholly deaf on that side. (Destruction 
of both cochlea and vestibular apparatus was made com- 
plete.) Training was continued for two or three weeks 
after the operation, which had not at all damaged the 
dog’s habit of responding to the low tones. The second 
cochlea was then exposed, and the desired part of it de- 
stroyed. The part destroyed was removed with a needle. 
The first animal operated upon, which had been trained 
before the operation to respond to the two tones A, and c’, 
showed no loss of accuracy in the habit when one cochlea 
was entirely destroyed and removed and the other de- 
stroyed as far down as the lowest turn. Only a small 
portion of the (one) cochlea-vestibular apparatus was left 
intact. The part of the organ of Corti and of the mem- 
brane of Reissner contained in this part of the cochlea, 
and also the cells of the spiral ganglion, which belong to 
this turn of the cochlea, were uninjured. Reaction to 
spoken words, ete., was perfect. Kalischer made a number 
of such cochlea extirpations. In general he concludes 
that the theory of Helmholtz and others, that the different 
parts of the cochlea and of the basilar membrane act selec- 
tively as receptors of long or short sound waves, is unten- 
able. He assumes further that the vestibular apparatus 
possesses an auditory function and that it is necessary for 
pitch discrimination.’ 
* Since destruction of both internal geniculate bodies destroys 
the possibility of training to both noise and tone. 
* Swift has also made experiments similar to those of Kalischer. 
He comes to the conclusion, from his experiments, that while the

  JOHNSON’S EXPERIMENTS 379 
Johnson’s experiments.—After the experiments of 
Kalischer and Rothman had appeared Johnson undertook 
in the Hopkins laboratory to repeat their work upon blind 
dogs. The forks used in the first test were standard forks 
mounted upon resonators. Two were used as stimuli, 
middle ¢-256 d.v., and g-384 dv. To the ¢ the dog had to 
respond by going to the right and climbing up in a chair, 
and to the g by going to the left and climbing up on a 
box. In the early tests, in which two dogs were used, the 
experimenter was in the room. Between the tests the 
dogs usually crouched between the experimenter’s legs or 
else sat upon their haunches near by. In a remarkably 
short time the habit arose. After the response to simple 
tones had been perfected clangs were tried. Again the 
dogs soon learned to climb up on the chair when the clang 
contained the e and to climb up on the box when it con- 
tained the g. Their responses soon became so machine-like 
that Johnson became suspicious of the stimulus to which 
the animals reacted. It became absolutely necessary to 
_ test the dogs in the absence of the experimenter. Several 
different methods were tried. The one proving most satis- 
factory is the one described on p. 85ff. After several 
months of experimentation by this improved method both 
upon normal and upon blind dogs Johnson having failed 
to confirm both his own earlier work and that of Kalischer 
reached the conclusion that if the dog is sensitive to dif- 
ferences in pitch it does not appear in tests of such a char- 
acter. Since Johnson in his preliminary work was able to 
repeat both Kalischer’s and Rothman’s findings in every 
detail, it would appear that their dogs were reacting to the 
same types of accidental stimuli as were Johnson’s dogs 
in the early tests. Johnson did not determine the nature 
of the secondary criteria in any detailed way. He supposes 
that his own dogs in the tests where positive results were 
obtained were using a variety of cues such as (1) breathing 
of experimenter, and (2) involuntary movements of the 
body, ete. 
center for pitch cannot lie in the temporal lobe, it does lie in the 
cortex, but in some other region. 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  
380 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
Since we know that the dog does respond to auditory 
stimuli, such as calls, whistles, ete., Johnson next designed 
a simple experiment. Two electric buzzers, differing in 
pitch and in their overtones, were employed. One buzzer 
was placed directly over the right-hand food box and the 
other over the left-hand food box. Here we have not only 
differences in pitch and timbre, intensity, etc., but differ- 
ence in localization as well. The problem assigned the 
dogs was to go to the right when the buzzer over the right 
compartment sounded and to go to the left when the left 
buzzer sounded. The dogs quickly learned this problem. 
When the buzzers were interchanged, however, the habit 
broke down. They had been reacting apparently on the 
basis of difference in localization. While these experiments 
of Johnson completely discredit the work of Kalischer, 
Rothman, and Swift, it would not be safe to conclude until 
‘further experimentation has been undertaken that the 
dog is insensitive to pitch difference. 
Experiments made by the Pawlow method.—The re- 
sults of tests made with the Pawlow method are fully as 
positive as those described by Kalischer; e.g., Selionyi 
states that tones which differ from each other by not more 
than a quarter of a tone can be reacted to differently by 
the dog; furthermore, that those which differ from one 
another only slightly in timbre are received as distinct 
stimuli. A single tone of a familiar chord of three tones 
of the same timbre and intensity produces a less intense 
response than do two tones of the same chord. Further- 
more, positive results were obtained with respect to the 
analysis of chords, ete. It is extremely improbable, in the 
light of Johnson’s work, that these responses are really 
responses to tone. From reading the description of this 
work we cannot gather that the results were controlled in 
Selionyi’s work any better than in Kalischer’s. 
Experiments of Syzmanski on localization.—In con- 
nection with the above experiments of Johnson on the 
localization of sound stimuli (electric bells) it is extremely 
interesting to note that Syzmanski failed both with cats and 
dogs to establish such a habit. His experiments were quite 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
  EXPERIMENTS UPON LOCALIZATION 381 
similar. Three fairly large boxes were placed in the form 
of an isosceles triangle. The two boxes on the ends of 
the base of the triangle were made large enough to contain 
food boxes. The food boxes were so constructed that only 
one could be entered. The other contained an equal amount 
of food which could not be reached (to equalize smell). 
A small electric bell was placed first on one box and then 
on the other. (The two food boxes could be interchanged.) 
The animal was released from the box at the apex of the 
triangle. Upon release the animal could go to the box 
from behind which the bell sounded and get food. The 
trials, as is usual in such cases, were given irregularly. 
Apparently only one trial per day was given each animal. 
Only about 21 days were used in the regular test and then, 
since a position habit developed, Syzmanski gave up the 
attempt to establish the habit. While from casual observa- 
tion he states that the animals can localize sounds, he 
thinks that the reason they failed to do so in the above 
test was due to the narrowness of the room (this being 
unfavorable to localization). 
(b) Cat: the response of cats to tones, noises, and to 
articulate sounds.—Numerous incidental observations at- 
test the fact that the cat is apparently keen-eared. Such 
observations, however, cannot be relied upon until tests 
experimentally controlled have been undertaken. We are 
lacking totally’ in exact information concerning auditory 
sensitivity. Rough tests, such as are about to be described, 
have been made. The absence of even such a simple con- 
trol as being out of sight of the animal when the stimulus 
was given robs them of much of the value they might other- 
wise have. Shepherd tested two cats, P and M, with two 
tones on a harmonica. To the note A-3 (food tone) cat P 
had to rear up on the cage with the fore-feet and look up 
at the top of the cage, M, being an inactive cat, merely had 
to look up at the top of the cage. To the note A-1 (non- 
food tone) both cats were to inhibit reaction. Forty-five 
trials were necessary to perfect the habit in one animal 
—P. The other cat, M, never learned entirely to inhibit 
reaction to the non-food tone, although there were signs 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
382 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
of definite improvement. The stimuli were then changed 
to A-2 (food tone) and to A-1 (non-food tone). P per- 
fected this habit in about 20 trials. The stimulus was 
then changed to piano tones—F-1 (food tone) and F-2 
(non-food tone). Forty trials in all were necessary to 
perfect the habit. Selionyi states that the cat can be 
taught to come from another room to be fed on the sound- 
ing of the C of a set of tuning pipes and to inhibit response 
to the other c’s in the same set. 
A rough test has also been made on the sensitivity of 
the cat to the difference in intensity between two noises. 
The noise-producing apparatus consisted of a wooden box 
18 x 11x10 inches and a slat 13x 4x 5/12 inches, fastened 
to the top of the box by a leather hinge. By raising the 
free end of the slat and letting it go a noise could be made, 
the intensity of which varied with the height of the fall. 
To give sounds of different degrees of intensity, two 
sticks, one 24 inches in length, and the other 4} inches, 
were separately used and placed perpendicular to the box 
under the free end of the slat. By pressing on the slat 
near the hinge and suddenly removing the stick two sounds 
could be produced which varied in intensity. Shepherd 
states that one cat learned in 40 trials to respond to the 
louder noise and to inhibit response to the fainter. 
The same observer states that the cat readily learns to 
respond to articulate sounds. A 7-months-old animal not 
hitherto called by any name was placed in a cage. The 
experimenter stood at a distance of 1 meter from the front 
of the cage and called the name given to the animal— 
“* Pet.’? Ten seconds were allowed the animal, if neces- 
sary, in which to give a proper motor response. Whether or 
not a response was obtained the animal was fed. In con- 
junction with the name given, other words were called, 
viz., ‘‘ no feed,’’ and when these latter words were called 
the cat was not fed. The response on the animal’s part was 
to rear up on its legs at the front of the cage. On the 
third day this animal began to show indications of forming 
the habit. The animal continued to improve and on the 
ninth day, or after 150 trials in all had been given, it re-  
-P-A-G-E-397
RESPONSE TO ARTICULATE SOUNDS 383 
sponded to the name 19 times in 20 trials. But it had not 
learned wholly to inhibit on the no feed call. On the thir- 
teenth day, fe after 250 trials, the cat had perfected the 
association. The words were called in varying tones of 
voice,—quite loud tones and very low ones. As a third test . 
the words were called by different persons. Another and 
much older animal showed no clear indication of forming 
the habit until the tenth day of experimentation. On that 
day it responded to ‘‘ Mary ’’ 10 times and to ‘‘ no feed ”’ 
6 times. After this, progress was slow; so slow that Shep- 
herd attributed its slowness to the marked inactivity 
of the older animal. He noticed, however, that when the 
cat’s name was called it would look up to the top of 
the box or at the food lying at a distance of about 1 meter 
from the front of the cage. The type of response re- 
quired of this animal was then changed. It was counted 
sufficient indication of a habit if the animal looked up 
towards the food when its name was called. Improvement 
was rapid. On the second day thereafter there were defi- 
nite signs of the appearance of the desired habit. On the 
twenty-fifth day it responded to the name ‘‘ Mary ”’ 19 
times and to ‘‘ no feed ’’ 4 times. The animal never suc- 
ceeded entirely in inhibiting the tendency to respond to 
the ‘‘no feed’’ call. Shepherd, in summarizing, says 
that the younger cat formed the habit in 250 trials and 
the older in 490. 
(c) Raccoons: reactions of raccoons to tones and 
articulate sounds.—Cole tested the ability of raccoons to 
react positively to a high tone and to inhibit response at 
a low tone. The response expected was that of mounting 
a high box on hearing the high tone. Pure tones were 
not available, so the highest possible note, Al, on an ordi- 
nary A French harp, and the lowest, A”, were used as 
stimuli. For the first few trials the hand was extended 
towards the high box when the food signal was given and 
the animal fed when it mounted the box. When this aid 
was withdrawn it was found that No. 1 was practically 
perfect in its response to the high tone, refusing to move 
at the low tone. No. 2 did not form the habit. There  
-P-A-G-E-398
884 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
seems to have been no effort to control the experiments. 
It is possible that the observer’s movements might have 
been the cue to the reaction. 
Shepherd states that raccoons can learn to respond to 
articulate sounds. Each raccoon was placed in a separate 
cage. Four cages were arranged in different parts of the 
room. The observer sat from 4 to 8 feet from the cages. 
The names of the raccoons were called in irregular order 
and the observer noted whether each animal responded to 
its own name or to all the names. Each animal was fed 
when it responded to its own name and was not fed when 
the other names were called. The names of the animals 
were Jack, Jim, Tom, and Dolly. The experiments were 
continued for 18 days, at the end of which time all the 
animals appeared to know their names perfectly. After 
the names had been learned, the observer called such words 
as ‘‘ box,’’ ‘‘ floor ’’ after the name, i.e., he called ‘‘ Jack, 
box, floor ’’ in succession and not alternately. No substan- 
tial difference in the percentage of proper responses was 
noted. Again, the sound of the voice was varied. The 
number of trials required to perfect the association varied 
with the different animals: Jack, 270 trials; Tom, 375; 
Jim, 425; Dolly, 500. 
Tests upon mice and rats.—Yerkes has made some in- 
teresting observations upon the dancing mouse. His re- 
sults are in agreement with those of Zoth. Both deny 
auditory sensitivity of any kind in the adult dancer. This 
animal is insensitive to such noises as are made by clapping 
the hands, shouting, whistling, exploding pistol caps, strik- 
ing on steel bars, and even the squealing of other mice. 
They are likewise insensitive to tones, such as the Galton 
whistle throughout its entire range, the Appunn whistle, 
and to the Konig forks, giving tones from 1024 to 16,382 
d.v. Indirect methods were attempted, as with the frog. 
Yerkes first tested to see if sounds interfered with their 
whirling. It had no effect. He then tested by the dis- 
crimination method, using punishment and food as mo- 
tives. The animal had to enter one of two boxes which 
could be interchanged in position. If it attempted to
-P-A-G-E-399
  TESTS UPON THE DANCING MOUSE 385 
enter the wrong box, it was warned by a bell. The mouse 
should then have sought the other box. Punishment en- 
sued if it persisted in entering the box before which it 
was warned. No positive results came from these experi- 
ments. A different condition obtained in the case of young 
mice. When they are tested at or before the age of three 
weeks, evidence of auditory sensitivity is found; it ap- 
pears in the form of starts, or trembling of the entire 
body. When the young are tested with the Konig forks, 
steel bars, ete., the results are as follows: During the first 
two weeks of life there is no evidence of hearing; during 
the third week, certain individuals respond vigorously to 
sudden high tones and loud noises. Not all of the young 
are sensitive even at this period. After the third week, 
no reaction is obtained. No careful experiments have 
been made upon the white rat, but all agree that from 
about the twelfth day after birth they respond by starts, 
cessation of activity, ete., to sounds. Some experiments 
made in the Hopkins laboratory in a control cage similar 
to that described on p. 87 show that the rats can learn to 
go to the right when a shrill rattling noise is made the 
instant before the animal is released and to go to the left 
when no sound is made before the animal is released. 
Sensitiveness to ordinary environmental sounds, such as 
feeding of companions, voice of mates, danger calls, etc., 
has been observed in a number of mammals, such as the 
guinea pig, porcupine, ete. 
Incidental tests upon other mammals: (a4) monkeys.— 
Although observations apparently show that the monkeys 
are extremely sensitive to noises in their environment, to 
ealls and cries of companions, ete., there is little reliable 
experimental data on the subject. Shepherd, with the 
noise-producing device described on p. 382, finds that the 
two rhesus monkeys tested required respectively 80 and 
110 trials to perfect a habit of responding to the louder of 
two noises. Their sensitivity to pitch was tested with the 
German mouth organ. When A-3 was sounded the monkey 
under observation had to climb to a platform. To other 
tones the animal had to inhibit action. One of the
-P-A-G-E-400
  
  386 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
animals formed the habit in 60 trials, the other in 80 
trials. 
(b) Horses.—Tests made by Pfungst on cavalry horses 
do not confirm the view that they have the ability to re- 
spond appropriately to the various bugle calls when not di- 
rected (involuntarily by the rider). At the bugle call the 
horses, if standing, would start to walk. If the commands 
were given while the horses were trotting or walking no 
effect of the order was noted. Likewise tests on ability to 
respond unequivocally to their own names failed: any simi- 
lar word spoken with the same inflection produced the same 
effect. Pfungst finds that few habits are developed around 
auditory stimuli. 
(c) Bats——Hahn finds that bats are very sensitive to 
vibrations of high frequency. A sharp whistle, sucking 
noise with the lips, tearing a sheet of paper, ete., caused 
them to start violently, but lower pitched noises had no 
effect. It has been stated that the sound of the hairy-armed 
bat’s voice has a frequency of 17,000 d.v. The pitch of 
the voice of American species has not been determined. It 
is not known whether bats hunt prey (insects, ete., usually 
at twilight) on the basis of sound. 
Aupitory Response IN Birps 
In pigeons and parrots.—It has been shown by Rouse 
that mechanical jars and sounds have marked effect upon 
the breathing rate of pigeons. It has also been shown that 
pigeons, chickens, ete., hurry through a labyrinth when 
they can hear other birds pecking at food. The sensitivity 
of parrots to sound has often been remarked. On p. 295 
we described the experiments made by Lashley on the imi- 
tation of sounds by parrots. 
Aupirory RESPONSE IN AMPHIBIA 
Frogs.—It is an interesting fact that the frog does not 
respond visibly to sound when tested under experimental 
conditions. In nature the animal seems to utilize sound
-P-A-G-E-401
HEARING IN FROGS 387 
stimuli as warning data. We quote Yerkes’ observations 
on the behavior of frogs in their natural habitat. 
“Tn order to learn how far fear and artificial conditions were 
causes of the inhibition of responses to sounds in the laboratory, and 
how far the phenomenon was indicative of the animal’s inability to 
perceive sounds, I observed frogs in their native haunts. 
“By approaching a pond quietly it is easy to get within a few 
yards of the frogs sitting on the banks. In most cases they will not 
jump until they have evidence of being noticed. Repeatedly I have 
noted that it is never possible to get near to any frogs in the same 
region after one has jumped in. In this we have additional proof that 
they hear the splash-sound. To make sure that sight was not re- 
sponsible for this on-guard condition in which one finds the frogs 
after one of their number has jumped into the water, I made ob- 
servations on animals that were hidden from one another. The 
results were the same. I therefore conclude that the splash of a frog 
jumping into the water is not only perceived by other frogs in the 
vicinity, but that it is a peculiarly significant sound for them, since it 
is indicative of danger, and serves to put them ‘on watch.’ 
“A great variety of sounds, ranging in pitch from a low tone in 
imitation of the bull frog’s croak to a shrill whistle, and in loudness 
from the fall of a pebble to the report of a pistol, was tried for 
the purpose of testing their effects upon the animals in their natural 
environment. To no sound have I ever seen a motor response given. 
One can approach to within a few feet of a green frog or bull frog 
and make all sorts of noises without causing it to give any signs 
of uneasiness. Just as soon, however, as a quick movement is made 
by the observer the animal jumps. I have repeatedly crept up very 
close to frogs, keeping myself screened from them by bushes or trees, 
and made various sounds, but have never succeeded in searing an 
animal into a motor response so long as I was invisible. Apparently 
they depend almost entirely upon vision for the avoidance of dangers. 
Sounds like the splash of a plunging frog or the croak or pain- 
scream of another member of the species serve as warnings, but the 
animals do not jump into the water until they see some signs of an 
unusual or dangerous object. On one occasion I was able to walk 
to a spot where a large bull frog was sitting by the edge of the water, 
after the frogs about it had plunged in. This individual, although it 
seemed to be on the alert, let me approach close to it. I then saw_ 
that the eye turned towards me was injured. The animal sat still, 
despite the noise I made, simply because it was unable to see me; 
as soon as I brought myself within the field of vision of the func- 
tional eye the frog was off like a flash. 
“Many observers have told me that frogs could hear the human 
voice and that slight sounds made by a passer-by would cause them 
‘to stop croaking. In no case, however, have such observers been able 
to assert that the animals were unaffected by visual stimuli at the 
same time. I have myself many times noticed the croaking stop 
as I approached a pond, but could never be certain that none of 
the frogs had seen me. It is a noteworthy fact that when one frog 
in a pond begins to croak the others soon join in, Likewise, when 
 
-P-A-G-E-402
388 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
one member of such a chorus is frightened and stops the others 
become silent. This indicates that the cessation of croaking is a sign 
of danger and is imitated just as is the croaking. There is in this 
fact conclusive evidence that the animals hear one another, and the 
probability is very great that they hear a wide range of sounds to 
which they give no motor reactions, since they do not depend upon 
sound for escaping their enemies. 
“The phenomenon of inhibition of movement in response to sounds 
which we have good reason to think the frogs hear, and to which 
such an animal as a turtle or bird would react by trying to escape, 
is thus shown to be common for frogs in nature as well as in the 
laboratory. This inhibition is in itself not surprising, since many 
animals habitually escape certain of their enemies by remaining mo- 
tionless, but it is an interesting phenomenon for the physiologist. We 
have to inquire, for instance, what effects sounds which stimu- 
late the auditory organs and cause the animal to become alert, 
watchful, yet make it remain rigidly motionless, have on the primary 
organic rhythms of the organism, such as the heart-beat, respiration, 
and peristalsis. It is also directly in the line of our investigation to 
inquire how they affect reflex movements, or the reaction of time 
for any other stimulus—what happens to the reaction time for an 
electrical stimulus, for example, if a loud noise precede or accom- 
pany the electrical stimulus.” (Harvard Psychological Studies, I, 
p- 629.) 
When certain physiological processes are being recorded, 
eg., breathing, it can be shown that auditory stimulation 
is effective. If the animal is being stimulated while breath- 
ing is being observed, marked changes in the rate and form 
of the curve are noticeable. The easiest way to observe 
the indirect effect of auditory stimulation is to mount the 
frog in a saddle in such a way that its legs hang free 
(p. 89). When the frog has ceased to struggle it is pos- 
sible to stimulate it tactually and to measure the distance 
to which the leg is jerked up. It is found that sounds 
given shortly before the tactual stimulus influence the 
height of the leg movement. If the sound (an electric 
bell) precedes the tactual stimulus by 1” it has no effect. 
If the interval is not longer than .35” it usually causes re- 
inforeement. When the interval is .4” to .9” there is partial 
inhibition of the leg reaction. The green frog was tested 
under three conditions: (1) When the tympanum was 
exposed fully to the air, although the body was submerged 
up to the level of the ear drum; (2) when the tympanum 
was half under water, the head and nares being in the  
-P-A-G-E-403
HEARING IN FISHES 389 
air; and (3) when the head of the frog was submerged to 
a depth of 4 cm. A bell electro-magnetically driven hung 
in the air and excluded from vision was used as the audi- 
tory stimulus. The effect of the sound on the leg reaction 
noted above was obtained under these several conditions. 
The range to which the frog’s ear is responsive is from 
50 to 10,000 vibrations per second. The response to 
sound may still be obtained after the tympana and 
columella are removed. Sectioning of the eighth nerve, 
however, causes complete loss of sensitivity. Attention is 
called to the fact that the influence of sounds is more 
marked in the spring months than in the winter months. 
Aupitory RESPONSE IN FISHES 
Some investigators who report lack of auditory sensi- 
tivity in fishes.—Bateson’s early observations on the effect 
of blasting on fish are interesting. It caused the congers 
to draw back a few inches, flat fish to bury themselves, 
and pouting to scatter momentarily in all directions. Cer- 
tain other fish are not affected by the sound. Similar re- 
sults were obtained by striking with a heavy stick upon an 
aquarium containing soles. Bateson concludes that the fish 
are sensitive to the sound of sudden shocks when severe 
but not to the sound of bodies moving in the water when 
the latter are unseen by them. E.g., striking a glass with 
a stone under water and out of sight of the fish does not 
produce a response. 
Kreidl reached similar conclusions with goldfish. These 
fish never responded to sound produced either in the water 
or outside in the air, but they did respond to heavy me- 
chanical jars. Fish made sensitive by strychnine would 
respond to jars produced by tapping the aquarium and 
even to clapping the hands in the air, but not to tuning 
forks or vibrating rods, even when these were in contact 
with the water. Kreidl removed the auditory nerves and 
the attached ear sacs and then gave the animals strychnine. 
In all cases they responded as did the stryehnized animals 
whose ears were intact. His conclusion was that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-404
  390 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
cutaneous receptors are stimulated by the sound waves 
(those produced by jars, ete.). 
Lee obtained no evidence that fish hear. He used the 
clapping of the hands, striking stones together in the air 
and in the water, the human voice, ete. He, with Kreidl, 
found that they are extremely sensitive to jars. 
Bernoulli, who has recently repeated the experiments of 
Zenneck cited below, fails to find any response to sound. 
A bell with ec, for its fundamental, with a basal diameter of 
94 mm. and a height of 62 mm., was fastened to a firm 
support with the dome immersed. The bell was electro- 
magnetically driven. The key for closing the cireuit was 
placed on land several meters away, behind a stone wall. 
The fish (‘‘ Forellen,’’ also eels and individuals belonging 
to ‘‘ Zander,’’ Lucio perca Sandra Cuv.) were tested in an 
open stream. He was never able to get the slightest re- 
sponse. Further tests showed that certain species of fish 
(Salmo fario L., and Thymallus vulgaris Nilos) were in- 
sensitive to shrill pipes, the sound waves from which were 
conducted to the water by the aid of a metal tube 4 m. 
long and 30 mm. in diameter. Other observations showed 
that fish (‘‘ Zander ’’) were totally insensitive to pistol 
shots fired at a distance of 2 km. He believes that when 
the fish respond at all they do so because they are either 
tactually or visually stimulated.t 
While the above summaries do not exhaust the literature 
on the negative side, they are the most important ones. 
Investigators reporting sensitivity to auditory stimu- 
lation.—Parker ® has been the champion of hearing in fish 
for many years. His experiments, though, are not con- 
ducive to complete trust. He argues that most of the work 
upon fish has failed to note that the auditory reflexes 
may be very inconspicuous and that a closer scrutiny of 
their behavior might reveal changes in them due to the 
effect of sound stimuli. He began his experiments upon 
* Parker and his students seem never to have considered the fact 
that the fish might be stimulated by the wave motion in the water. 
°Tt will be recalled, however, that Parker himself was unable 
to get any response to auditory stimuli in the dogfish (Mustelus 
canis) by the method about to be described.  
-P-A-G-E-405
  
HEARING IN FISHES 391 
killifish, Fundulus hetereroclitus. There are three possi- 
bilities of obtaining response to such vibrations: (1) Stimu- 
lation through the skin; (2) stimulation through the lateral 
line organs; and (3) stimulation through the eighth nerve 
(auditory response?). In response to the vibrations made 
by the string (see p. 393 for method) he noted in normal fish 
four kinds of movement: (1) Vibratory movements of the 
pectoral fins; (2) change in the rate of respiratory move- 
ment, usually increased; (3) if the sound was at all intense 
there was a slight movement of the caudal fin; (4) finally, 
the fish under strong stimulation would make a quick 
spurt or spring forward. In fish whose auditory nerves 
had been cut, he failed to obtain the movements of the 
pectoral fins, which was the most characteristic response 
and the one easiest to observe. Ten fish were observed and 
10 observations were made upon each animal. In 82 ob- 
servations he obtained no response from the pectoral fin. 
In 18 there was a slight movement. He next made the skin 
insensitive by cutting the sensory nerve supply innervating 
the skin area—viz., the fifth, seventh, and part of the 
tenth cranial nerves and transecting the cord between the 
fourth and fifth vertebre. The auditory organs, after 
such an operation, were presumably still completely func- 
tional. Parker states that the auditory responses in such 
animals were normal. 
Recently, Bigelow, under the guidance of Parker, re- 
tested goldfish (Carassius auratus L.). His results are 
wholly different from those obtained by Kreidl (p. 389). 
His method of testing the fish was as follows: An 
aquarium was made with one end of wood. An electric 
tuning fork of 100 vibrations per second was used as the 
stimulus. The fork rested upon a table separate from the 
one which supported the tank. After the fork was started 
it was moved until its base came in contact with the 
wooden end of the aquarium. ‘‘ This could easily be ac- 
complished without observable jar to the water in the 
aquarium, and certainly in itself had no effect on the 
fishes. For when I made the fork, not in vibration, touch 
the aquarium in the usual way, the fishes gave no reaction,
-P-A-G-E-406
  392 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
although to the vibrating fork they were very responsive; 
I tried this many times.’’? When tested under these condi- 
tions normal fish respond to the stimulus usually in one 
of several different ways, such as tail jerks followed by 
forward swimming movement; tail jerks without. locomo- 
tion; tail jerks and trunk jerks followed by a turn to one 
side, etc. Of 193 observations 150 gave positive results. 
Of the 43 failures 12 were observations on albino fish. 
The other 31 were due, Bigelow states, to the difficulty of 
observing certain individuals which were in continual rapid 
motion. The skin was next made insensitive by cutting 
the cord just posterior to the pectoral fins, and the lateral 
branches of the tenth, fifth, and seventh nerves on both 
sides of the body. When such fish are tested (they lie 
quietly on their sides on the bottom of the tank unless 
stimulated) they are normal essentially in their reactions 
to the fork. When, however, the eighth nerves were cut, 
reaction to the fork disappeared. Similarly, Zenneck has 
obtained evidence of response to sound in three fresh-water 
fish (Leuciscus rutilus, L. dobula, and Alburnus lucidus). 
He used a bell electro-magnetically driven. Occasionally 
he put a piece of leather over the place where the clapper 
struck. The fish responded by swimming away when the 
stroke of the bell was given, but did not respond when the 
leather damped the sound. In exact contradiction to this 
work stands that of Bernoulli (cited above, p. 390). The 
work of Bernoulli is more recent and seems to have been 
earried out much more carefully. 
Intensity of sound stimuli in water.—Parker criticizes 
all work earlier than his own on account of the fact that 
the sound fish were supposed to respond to was always 
generated, not in the water where the fish reside, but in 
the air. He cites an experiment where a dinner bell was 
rung in the air by a person standing breast deep in the 
water. The listener remained a few feet away with head 
under water. The sound seemed to cease when the diver 
got his head under water. In like manner a bell rung or 
hit with a stone under water is heard at best faintly by a 
person standing in the water unless his head is also im-
-P-A-G-E-407
  EXPERIMENTS ON SOUND INTENSITIES 393 
mersed. In a recent paper he states that the noise even of 
a motor boat is extremely faint under water. The author, 
with the codperation of Dr. Alfred G. Mayer and Dr. A. J. 
Goldfarb, at the Marine Biological Laboratory of the Car- 
negie Institution, Tortugas, Florida, has made several tests 
upon sounds heard under water. The experimenter tapped 
two small pieces of coral together under water. The ob- 
servers would swim farther and farther away, diving at 
intervals to listen for the sound. It was found that this 
faint noise was heard clearly for a distance of at least 
200 feet. The same sound made in the air and heard by 
the observer with his head in the air was audible for a 
much greater distance than in the test just described. 
Parker is unquestionably right in his statement that 
sounds made in the air are all but inaudible to an observer 
whose head is under water. In one experiment carried out 
by the author at Tortugas with Dr. Goldfarb, it was found 
that the noise of a 38-caliber revolver when fired in the air 
directly over the surface of the water could not be heard 
by an observer who had dived to a depth of 4 feet. The 
fact that sounds made in the air offer very faint stimula- 
tion to the ear under water has led Parker to adopt a very 
crude apparatus to increase the sound intensity, viz., to 
insert a wooden board in place of one of the glass sides of 
one of his tanks, and to attach to it a string, vibrating at 
40 d.v. per second. 
Summary.—It seems very difficult to reach any conclu- 
sion in the face of such contradictory evidence. The failure 
to obtain response to sound vibration in earless fish would 
seem to offer crucial evidence, and yet the cutting of the 
eighth nerve must produce profound changes in the motor 
apparatus of the fish. It must be remembered that the re- 
action of the fish to auditory stimuli (at least those which 
can be surely observed, such as the movements of the 
pectoral fins, starts, ete.) are not very marked at best and 
even those movements may be dependent upon the impulses 
which normally come from the semicircular canals, vesti- 
bules, ete. Elimination of these impulses, which occur 
when the eighth nerve is cut, might easily account for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-408
    
394 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
facts observed in earless fishes. It seems strange, since 
Parker so clearly recognizes the fact that sounds made 
under water are reasonably intense, that he did not repeat 
Bateson’s experiment of tapping objects together under 
water outside the range of vision of the fish. Such an 
experiment upon one of the forms which gave positive re- 
sults would have been far more conclusive than all of the 
evidence he gathered through cutting the eighth nerve. 
Certainly the forms of apparatus used by Parker and by 
Bigelow to produce intense sounds are open to the severest 
kind of criticism. It would indeed have been hard to 
devise apparatus which would have offered more secondary 
criteria. 
The lateral line organs.—Examination of the external 
markings of the fish shows a line which extends along the 
side from the head to the tail. The line is pierced at in- 
tervals by small pores, which lead into an underlying canal, 
the lateral line canal. This canal branches at the head 
into three divisions: one passes forward and above the eye; 
a second forward and below the eye; and the third down- 
ward and over the lower jaw. The system as a whole is 
known as the lateral line system. The system in one or 
another form appears in amphibia in the water inhabiting 
stage as well as in fishes. The lateral line system is richly 
supplied with sensory structures, which look not unlike 
the ordinary taste buds. Microscopic examination shows 
that these sensory structures as a whole are made up of 
supporting cells and sensory cells, which are pear-shaped 
and supplied with cuticular hairs. It is around the base 
of these cells that the medullated nerve fibers end. The 
sensory innervation comes largely from the seventh and 
tenth cranial nerves. Various opinions have been held as 
to the function of these organs. As long ago as 1870 
Schulze developed the view that the stimulus was to be 
found in mass movements of the water and in sound waves 
of too great length to affect the ear. Other views have been 
advanced as to their probable function. Certain observers 
who have made operative experiments have held the view 
that they were organs for the production of gas in the
-P-A-G-E-409
  THE LATERAL LINE ORGANS 395 
swim-bladder; that they were organs for secreting slime ; 
that they were necessary to orientation, equilibration, ete. 
Recent experiments by Parker tend to support Schulze’s 
(theoretical) view that they are intermediate in character 
between the skin and the ear and that the stimulus to 
which the lateral line organs respond is a water vibration 
of low frequency. By a very simple operation (sectioning 
the sensory nerves which run to these organs) the whole 
system can be thrown out of gear. When these nerves are 
sectioned the fish almost invariably recover. They are 
then hardly distinguishable from normal fish. This differ- 
ence, however, appears: If normal fish are observed in an 
aquarium it will be found that any slight jar or oscillation 
of the tank will cause them to dart at once to the bottom. 
The fish whose lateral line organs have been thrown out of 
gear will not respond to such a stimulus. They swim 
about even when the tank is violently agitated. 
Hofer, however, does not accept this conclusion of Parker. 
He carried out an extensive series of investigations upon 
the lateral line organs. He asserts that the stimuli cited 
by Parker as affecting the lateral line system—such as slow 
vibrations obtained by jarring the aquarium, blowing waves 
across the water, dropping in stones, ete.—affect really 
only the cutaneous receptors. Hofer was enabled to get re- 
actions to these stimuli when the lateral line system had 
been destroyed in certain fish (Cyprinus carpio, Cottus 
gobio, Esox lucius). They are more prompt and pronounced 
when the fish are left for some time in a weak solution 
of strychnine. The reason why Parker failed to get such 
responses in fish whose lateral line organs were destroyed 
is due to the choice of a poor method of operation—one 
which destroyed along with the lateral line system certain 
of the cutaneous nerves supplying the skin of the head 
region (according to Hofer the skin of the body of the fish 
is not supplied with touch spots, i.e., with organs for the 
reception of such stimuli as fixed bodies, ete. In the head 
region the skin is supplied with such spots, also with warm 
spots, but it is lacking in cold spots). The loss of the 
very sensitive cutaneous areas of the head thus apparently
-P-A-G-E-410
  
396 AUDITORY AND RELATED FUNCTIONS 
accounts for the results obtained by Parker. From numer- 
ous experiments Hofer concludes that the lateral line organs 
are stimulated only by the streaming movements of the 
water. Such streams exert continuous pressure which 
differs in direction and in force. Their function in guiding 
the fish in migration is apparent. The stream or current 
of water need only possess slight intensity—a stream too 
slight to influence the labyrinths will arouse the lateral 
line system. Hofer states that the organs are not directly 
involved in reactions to fixed objects. On the other 
hand, as the fish approaches fixed objects currents are 
generated which, when reflected towards the animal, stimu- 
late the lateral line organs. In this way these organs act 
like distance receptors. Increasing or decreasing the depth 
of the water (hydrostatic pressure) does not arouse the 
receptors in the lateral line organ.

Olfactory reactions in mammals.'—Behavior can con- 
tribute but little at the present time towards the solution 
of the many problems which arise in the field of smell in 
mammals. In the course of a number of years of work 
upon the other senses several incidental observations have 
been made upon mammals which show that olfactory stim- 
uli influence behavior, but few specific studies have so far 
been instituted. The technical difficulties in the way of 
making careful experiments are very great. Smell sen- 
sitivity in the white rat has been tested incidentally several 
times in connection with experiments upon learning: 
It has been shown that this animal, when given the 
opportunity of going to two food boxes, the one of 
which contains a bottle filled with bread, the other of 
which contains a similar bottle without food and a piece 
+ We know from Read’s recent work that the olfactory nerves are 
large and numerous in the dog and in the cat, and that they are 
larger and more numerous in the former than in the latter. In 
both dog and cat nearly one-half of the ethmoturbinal folds bear 
olfactory structures, which is a much larger distribution than we 
find in man,

of buried cheese, runs quickly to the food box con- 
taining the empty bottle and the buried cheese. Certain 
experiments have been made to test whether rats track one 
another through entrances, etc. The following apparatus 
was used: Four rectangular boxes with wooden sides and 
wire netting at the two ends were constructed. Through 
one of the wire ends of each box a pasteboard mailing 
tube three inches in diameter was admitted. Strips of 
paper were rolled and used to line the tubes. Two of the 
tubes whose positions could be varied were kept smelling 
of the odor of a rat and two were kept free from such odor 
(the lining was changed after each test). The animal 
could obtain food in any one of the four boxes after pass- 
ing through the tube attached to it. The animals were 
admitted to the restraining cage first on the West side, 
then in order, East, North, and South. The young rats 
failed to show any tendency to track one another. On the 
other hand, when adult males and females not living in 
the same cage were tested, the results were positive. In 24 
trials the total number of tubes entered smelling of the 
opposite sex was 19, whereas the total number entered free 
from odor of opposite sex was 5. When white rats were 
tested on the problem given the ring dove (see p. 406) 
they learned after a short time to run towards the source 
of the odor (oil of bergamot). In a total of 59 trials 
where there were 3 chances of error on each test the male 
rat’s responses were right in 62% of the trials, the females, 
714%. Considering the small number of trials given this 
high percentage of correct responses is remarkable. In- 
cidental tests upon raccoons, porcupines, and monkeys 
fail to show any great use of the sense of smell. Cole states 
that the raccoon will find a piece of sugar lying upon the 
floor of the cage more quickly than a piece of meat. Mon- 
keys occasionally discard an object after smelling it before 
putting it into the mouth (but rarely). The Cebus will 
occasionally smell an object, discard it, and then wipe the 
hands upon the body. 
Romanes’ test of the hunting dog.—The dog’s sense of 
smell is probably very highly developed. In a well-known
-P-A-G-E-415
  HUNTING BEHAVIOR OF DOGS 401 
experiment Romanes tested the ability of a setter to track 
her master’s scent. 
He used twelve men, forcing them to walk Indian file, each man 
taking care to step in the tracks of the leader. “I took the lead 
while the game-keeper brought up the rear. When we had walked 
two hundred yards, 1 turned to the right, followed by five of the 
men; and at the point where I had turned to the right, the seventh 
man turned to the left, followed by all the remainder. The two 
parties . . . having walked in opposite directions for a consider- 
able distance, concealed themselves, and the bitch was put upon the 
common track of the whole party before the point of divergence. 
Following this common track with rapidity, she at first overshot 
the point of divergence, but quickly recovered it and without hesi- 
tation chose the track which turned to the right.” ? 
Difficulties’ in the way of explaining the hunting be- 
havior of dogs.—It is believed by hunters that the com- 
mon hounds used for hunting rabbits in the South can 
follow a trail 10 to 12 hours old without back-tracking! 
It has been stated that the bloodhound has an even more 
highly developed sense of smell. Some writers have gone 
so far as to say that the animals will follow a trail at least 
24 hours old and in the direction taken by the quarry. In 
trying to explain how the dog follows a trail always in the 
forward direction we meet with.a number of difficulties. 
It is generally supposed that the dog is able to do this 
on the basis of the difference in the intensity between the 
tracks earlier made and those made later. Johnson finds on 
theoretical grounds that this explanation is not satisfactory. 
He presents the difficulties in the way of such a view so 
clearly that we quote his statements at length: ‘ 
“Suppose that in each of a series of tracks, a, 6, c, ete., a like 
quantity of the same single smell-substance had been deposited by 
the rabbit; that the tracks had been made one second apart, and 
that a@ was made three hours ago. It is evident (changes of chemical 
composition being excluded) that the smell-substance is greatest in 
quantity when first deposited. It becomes dissipated in time so 
that in this case there is hardly enough left in the track a to affect 
the dog. 
“Tf the smell-substance is deposited in a gaseous state its diffusion 
could be represented by one of the well-known ‘curves of decay.’ 
The absolute intensity of the stimulus (i.., the amount of odorous 
? Quoted from Washburn, p. 103, 
 
-P-A-G-E-416
  402 SMELL 
substance present in the track at a given moment of time) may, 
within limits, be formulized: 
Log St =Log So — kt, 
wherein So equals the amount of the substance first deposited, t 
the time which had elapsed since the deposit was made, and k a con- 
stant function dependent on conditions of temperature, pressure, ete. 
“Tn the case under consideration the stimulus-intensity at the 
track a-is nearly zero when it is presented to the dog. The absolute 
difference of stimulus-intensity at a, b, and c would have to be ex- 
tremely small, since the difference in the respective values of t is 
of the order of one part in nearly 11,000. Further: even this differ- 
ence between a and 6 would exist only if they were simultaneously 
presented. Since the dog is supposed to be following the trail of 
the rabbit, for him to be affected by even a part of the difference 
between @ and 6 it is necessary that he travel faster than did the 
rabbit in making the tracks. If the dog travels at the same rate 
as did the rabbit, when he reaches b its intensity will be just equal 
to that of a when a was passed. Moreover, in actual practice other 
difficulties arise. Suppose the rabbit has run from moist ground 
to dry ground. The smell-substances are diffused more rapidly 
under conditions of relatively small humidity than under conditions 
of greater humidity. The stimulus-intensity of the recently made 
tracks on dry ground could thus be less than those made earlier on 
the wet ground. In such case our assumption fails to explain the 
dog’s failure to show confusion. 
“But the dissipation of the smell-substance may be a complex 
process. For instance, it may be deposited, not in a gaseous state, 
but as a liquid or solid. In such case vaporization must precede 
diffusion. Vaporization, conditions being constant, proceeds at 
nearly a uniform rate in the open air. The amount of substance 
present in a gaseous state might thus be as great at a very advanced 
stage of dissipation as at an earlier stage. Since the substance to 
be odorous must be gaseous, we are not warranted in assuming that 
the stimulus-intensity is greater at a recently made track than at 
one made earlier, unless we know that all the smell-substance in 
the later track has been vaporized. 
“There may be other factors such as chemical changes by which 
“the deposited substance becomes odorous, etc., but consideration of 
them only increases the presumption against the intensity-difference 
theory. 
“Tt has been suggested also that the dog may have an acute 
olfactory sensitivity to the form of the tracks made by his quarry 
and follow the trail from heel to toe. Certain features of the dog’s 
behavior certainly indicate that he is very sensitive to differences 
of spatial position of olfactory stimuli. Another suggestion is that 
the smell-substances deposited by the different parts of the foot or 
body may differ specifically in stimulating quality, and that the 
dog is affected by this difference. Assuming either of these sug- 
gestions as a complete explanation of the dog’s hunting behavior 
would require us to expect a bloodhound striking a man’s trail at 
right angles, to back-track if the man had walked backward instead 
of forward across the field.
-P-A-G-E-417
  SMELL IN BIRDS 403 
“Dr. P. W. Cobb has suggested a simple hypothesis; that the 
dog’s sense of direction may be due to the trailing of ground smell- 
substances. For instance: the smell-substances affecting a dog 
trailing a man who had crossed a mint-bed might be (1) 
ground-++ man; (2) ground-++ man-+ mint, the mint being intense; 
(3) .ground-++man- mint, the mint-smell-substances diminishing 
rapidly in the direction the man had taken. The hypothesis impresses 
the writer as being valuable, although it does not afford a complete 
explanation of the facts as variously alleged. 
“The value of careful field-tests should be apparent. The question 
may well be raised whether the hunting-behavior of the dog is really 
an olfactory response. A comparison of the field-behavior of anosmic 
dogs and normal dogs of the same litter and of a hunting breed, 
such as the beagle-hound, should prove highly interesting. It would 
be well worth while to ascertain as a beginning what responses a 
good hunting dog actually makes when introduced to trails the 
time and direction of which had previously been ascertained. The 
effect of numerous disturbing factors which could be introduced, 
some of which have been suggested above, ought to be quite inter- 
esting. It is to be hoped that some one with proper facilities and 
ample training may become interested enough to make an experi- 
mental investigation in this field.” 
Of the ‘‘ field of smell ’’ in mammals; of their ‘‘ posi- 
tiveness ’’ or ‘‘ negativeness ’’ (preferences) to certain 
smells and of the groups or classes of smells to which they 
are sensitive, we know almost nothing. 
Experiments on the olfactory sensitivity of birds—~ 
The question of the influence of smell stimuli on the be- 
havior of birds has always been an interesting one. Some 
birds possess both well-developed central and peripheral 
apparatus. Below (Fig. 65) are shown the dissections of 
the brain of the fulmar—a bird allied to the petrel and 
albatross—which has a well-developed olfactory system, 
and that (Fig. 66) of the raven, which has a poorly de- 
veloped olfactory organ. 
No incontestable positive evidence has ever been.obtained 
to show that birds are sensitive to olfactory stimuli. The 
anecdotal literature is lengthy and interesting, but incon- 
clusive. As an example we cite the following observation, 
which appears in the literature: An observer states that 
while digging sweet potatoes in a field he noticed a luxu- 
riant growth of vines over a small mound and that the po- 
tatoes dug at this place were unusually large. On inquiry 
he learned that a horse and a cow had been buried there

ground about the mound. These birds continued to come 
for several days but in lessening numbers. No taint could  
-P-A-G-E-419
SMELL IN BIRDS 405 
be detected in the air. The experiments of Audubon are 
well known. The ones cited below were conducted with 
some care. The first four experiments were made by 
Audubon himself; the remaining ones are cited by Audu- 
bon from other sources. 
1. An entire deer skin, including the hoofs, and provided with 
artificial eyes, was stuffed with dried grass, the whole being allowed 
to become “ perfectly dry.” The stuffed skin was exposed in a large 
field, and the observer concealed himself not far away. In a few 
minutes a vulture, soaring about, saw the deer skin and sailed down 
to it. The hide was torn open, and much grass was pulled out. 
2. A large dead hog was hauled to a ravine and concealed by 
a covering of cane. As the weather was warm, the body became 
“extremely fetid” in a couple of days. Dogs found’ the carcass 
and féd heartily upon it, but vultures sailing over from time to 
time did not find it. 
3. A young pig was killed, and its blood was scattered about on 
the ground. The body was concealed by a covering of leaves. Vul- 
tures found the blood and followed it down the ravine to the body, 
which was then discovered and devoured. 
4. Two young vultures were kept for some weeks in a cage where 
they became accustomed to receiving food. The birds were in the 
habit of hissing and gesticulating when they saw food approaching. 
However, when food, either fresh or putrid, was brought up to the 
immediate rear of the cage where the vultures could not see it, no 
excitement was shown. 
5. A dead hare, two dead birds, and a wheelbarrow full of offal 
from a slaughter house were deposited on the ground at the foot of 
Bachman’s garden in South Carolina. A frame was raised above 
the pile at a distance of twelve inches from the ground, and this 
was covered with brush, allowing air to pass under freely. Though 
hundreds of vultures passed over in the next twenty-five days, none 
noticed the meat. 
6. A coarse painting on canvas of a sheep skinned and cut open 
was placed on the ground, where it was noticed by vultures. They 
walked over the painting and tugged at it with their beaks. The 
painting was then placed within fifteen feet of the offal mentioned 
above, but the offal was not touched. 
7. The most offensive portions of the offal were next placed on 
the ground, and these were covered by a thin canvas cloth on which 
were strewn several pieces of fresh beef. Vultures came and ate 
the beef, but they did not discover the offal beneath the canvas. 
A rent was then made in the canvas, whereupon the offal below 
was seen and eaten. (Taken largely from Strong.) 
The following experiment of Darwin on condors like- 
wise gave negative results: 
“The condors were tied, each by a rope, in a long row at the 
bottom of a wall and having folded up a piece of meat in a white 
 
-P-A-G-E-420

paper, I walked backwards and forwards, carrying it in my hand at 
the distance of about three yards from them, but no notice was 
taken. I then threw it on the ground, within one yard of an old 
bird; he looked at it for a moment with attention but then re- 
garded it no more. With a stick I pushed it closer and closer, until 
at last he touched it with his beak; the paper was then instantly 
torn off with fury, and at the same moment, every bird in the long 
row began struggling and flapping its wings.” 
Rouse has made experiments in the laboratory of the 
respiratory changes in pigeons when subjected to smell 
stimuli. To such odors as oil of bergamot and lily of the 
valley no appreciable change in the respiratory curve could 
be noted. Only slight change was noted when asafctida 
was used as the stimulus. On the other hand, ‘‘ marked 
reaction ’’ was produced by turpentine and ammonia. 
Such substances affect the fifth nerve rather than the olfac- 
tory, as Rouse clearly recognized. Beebe, on the other 
hand, feels that he has obtained slight positive evidence 
that birds use the olfactory organs: 
Three boxes were placed some distance apart in the floor of a 
cage containing turkey and black vultures. After several days of 
fasting a piece of tainted meat was placed under the central box. 
Care was taken to raise the other boxes and to go through the farce 
of placing something under them. The vultures were very hungry, 
yet they did not leave their perches and come to the ground, although 
they had watched his movements. He next reéntered and threw two 
or three bits of meat to the ground. 
Within a second or two, almost as the meat left the hand of the 
keeper, every vulture swooped to the ground and was hissing and 
struggling for a portion of the food. Twice the black vultures 
walked close about the meat box without appearing to notice the 
odor which was clearly perceptible, even to persons outside the 
cage. A turkey vulture walked to leeward, instantly turned and 
made his way to the box, which he examined on all sides. He was 
soon joined by two others of the same species, and all three took up 
their stations close to the source of the odor. Soon two black 
vultures came up, apparently impelled more by imitation than by 
actual discovery of the smell. All five birds remained for a long 
time grouped close to the box, going to it now and then, and examin- 
ing it carefully. Thus even in the turkey vulture the sense of smell 
is certainly not highly developed, and compared with the sense of 
sight, is defective indeed. 
R. M. Strong in this country has paid most attention 
to the olfactory responses in birds. His observational ma- 
terial is mainly inconclusive or negative. In one observa-
-P-A-G-E-421
  
SENSE OF SMELL IN FISHES 407 
tion he states that a turkey vulture was flushed from the 
entrance of a gopher-turtle hole: 
“The bird showed a great disinclination to leave the spot, al- 
though other individuals which were seen by the writer outside of 
cities were disposed to be wild. A dead gopher-turtle was found 
inside the burrow. It was impossible to view the turtle except when 
in a position to look down the oblique burrow, and it did not seem 
probable that a bird when flying overhead could see the body. A 
very strong odor of carrion prevailed for some distance on the lee 
side of the burrow. 
“The writer could not rule out the possibility that the vulture 
had found the turtle outside of the hole through its sense of vision 
and had later pushed the body inside, but it seemed unlikely that 
this had happened. The circumstances all appeared to favor the 
conclusion that the carrion had been smelled, even though the evi- 
dence was far from conclusive.” 
In a long series of laboratory experiments where ring 
doves were used as subjects Strong obtained some evidence 
that these birds were stimulated by oil of bergamot. The 
apparatus was somewhat elaborate. The animal under test 
was put down in such a position that it could be stimulated 
by a gentle air current passing over oil of bergamot. If 
the animal followed up this odor it could obtain food 
(seeds). The apparatus was so arranged that the food 
could be placed in any one of four food compartments. 
The birds, while showing definite improvement in forming 
such a habit, never became perfect in their responses. Un- 
fortunately Strong did not control his work by sectioning 
the olfactory bulbs. It is of course possible that the birds 
were reacting to cutaneous stimulation (fifth nerve). 
The sense of smell in fishes.—Until within recent times 
there has been little scientific evidence that fish react to 
foods at a distance. It has been the general practice of 
fishermen, however, to bait a locality preparatory to fishing 
in it. This has worked well in the case of the shark and cer- 
tain other fish, but in such cases it is difficult to say whether 
the shark senses the food at a distance and then follows the 
trace or whether chance swimming in the neighborhood 
leads him to the place where the food can be seen (or, if at 
night, tasted). We know from anatomical studies that 
the olfactory bulb and its central connections are well de-
-P-A-G-E-422
    
408 : SMELL 
veloped, and that the peripheral organs are also well 
developed. Furthermore, we know that the fish has well- 
developed gustatory structures. The neural systems in- 
volved in the gustatory organs are different from those 
which care for the olfactory mechanism. Notwithstand- 
ing these well-marked morphological differences certain 
authors have maintained that the so-called olfactory organ 
is only a finely developed taste organ. The difficulty the 
human being has in smelling a substance contained in a 
fluid when the fluid is actually in contact with the olfactory 
membrane has led him to say that he smells only gaseous 
and vaporous materials, while, on the other hand, he tastes 
fluids and solids. No one can say positively that gaseous 
particles have to be dissolved by the mucus present on 
the surface of the regio olfactoria before activity is initiated 
in that receptor, yet it is generally so admitted. We know 
positively, on the other hand, that no substance which can- 
not be dissolved by the fluids of the mouth can be tasted. 
The only difference between smell and taste on this view 
would be in the concentration of the fiuids in the two cases. 
The olfactory mechanism is sensitive to fluids of slight 
concentration. On such an hypothesis we can conceive of 
a very small particle of meat being carried out by currents 
and stimulating the olfactory receptors, e.g., of sharks, 
even at great distances. If such is the case the olfactory 
mechanism becomes a distance receptor ranking with the 
ear and with the eye. To Baglioni, apparently, belongs 
the credit of advancing the first scientific experimental 
evidence that food substances dissolved in a fluid medium 
can act upon the olfactory organs of marine forms in the 
way we have just described, and yet the distinction between 
animals which ‘‘ scent ’’ their food and those whichsee it was 
made by Bateson many years ago. Baglioni’s experiments 
were carried out in 1908 upon the octopus and fish (Balistes 
capriscus). He first blinded the animals in order to make 
observation more sure. He states that the effect of this 
operation was to be seen mainly in the limitation of their 
spontaneous movements. The blind fish especially re- 
mained quietly resting behind some object in the aquarium,
-P-A-G-E-423
  
SENSE OF SMELL IN FISHES 409 
This limitation of movements favors the observation of 
their response to olfactory substances. Baglioni describes 
his experiments mainly with the octopus and states that 
the behavior of the fish is the same. We describe one of his 
experiments upon the octopus: 
An octopus which had been blinded for more than a month was 
placed in a tank, the water of which was constantly being renewed 
from a faucet placed near the middle of the aquarium. The tank 
was 1.75 meters in length, 40 mm. in breadth, and 25 mm. in 
height. When the octopus was quietly resting at one end a small 
dead fish was thrown into the opposite end which came to rest on 
the bottom. In 1.25 minutes the octopus became agitated. Move- 
ments of the arm began and then of the whole body. In 3.5 minutes 
the animal had reached the middle of the basin. At the end of 5 
more seconds one arm touched the fish. The fish was seized and 
carried to the mouth. 
Experiments by Parker and Sheldon.—Parker and 
Sheldon have obtained still more striking evidence of the 
essentially olfactory nature of such responses. They have 
worked mainly with the smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis), 
the killifish (Mundulus heteroclitus), and the fresh-water 
catfish (Ameiurus nebulosus). All three forms, while 
differing in the details of their responses, show ability to 
respond to stimuli which affect the olfactory apparatus. 
We present Parker’s excellent summary of his experiments 
upon the catfish: 
“Ameiurus nebulosus is a bottom-feeding fish possessing fair 
powers of sight and unusual gustatory organs located not only in 
the mouth and on the general outer surface of the body, but es- 
pecially on the eight barblets about the mouth (Herrick, 1903). It is 
a hardy fish, living well in confinement and undergoing operations 
with success. It possesses near its anterior end a pair of nasal 
chambers, each of which is provided with two apertures, one anterior, 
the other posterior. The anterior aperture is nearly circular in 
outline and is located on a slight conical elevation somewhat anterior 
to the root of the dorsal barblet. The posterior aperture is slit-like 
in form and lies immediately posterior to the same barblet. The 
anterior aperture is apparently always open; the posterior one 
seems capable of slight closure, but is usually freely open. 
“By keeping catfishes a few days without food they can be made 
most eager for it, and if into an assemblage of such individuals a 
few fragments of fresh earthworms are dropped, the excitement 
that ensues will last some time after the final piece of worm has 
been swallowed, During this period the fishes swim about actively

in the lower part of the aquarium, now in this direction, now in that, 
and frequently sweep the bottom with their barblets. As can be 
noticed when feeding actually occurs, the fishes seldom seize a frag- 
ment of worm until their barblets have come in contact with it. 
Yet before they have thus touched any food they show a marked 
degree of excitement and it is this initial nervous state that would 
lead an observer to suspect that they scented their food. This phase 
of their activity was, therefore, taken as the one to be tested in 
connection with their olfactory organs. 
“The nasal chambers of the catfish contain ciliated epithelium, 
the action of which is to draw water in at the anterior olfactory 
opening and discharge it at the posterior one. As can be demon- 
strated with carmine suspended in water, the passage through the 
chamber is accomplished in 8 to 10 seconds. 
“As a preliminary step in testing the catfishes, five normal fishes 
were placed in a large aquarium over night that they might become 
accustomed to their surroundings. In this aquarium were then 
hung two wads of cheesecloth, in one of which was concealed some 
minced earthworm. The fishes, which were swimming about near 
these wads, were then watched for an hour and their reactions in 
reference to the wads were recorded. The wad without worms was 
passed by the fishes many times and did not excite any noticeable 
reaction. The wad containing the worms was seized and tugged at 
eleven times in the course of the hour, notwithstanding the fact that 
from time to time this and the other wad were interchanged in 
position. Not only did the fishes thus openly seize this wad, but 
when in its neighborhood they would often turn sharply as though 
seeking something without success, a form of reaction seldom observed 
near the wad which contained no worms. Two other sets, of five 
normal fishes each, were tested in this manner and with similar re- 
sults. It was perfectly clear to any one watching these reactions 
that the fishes sensed the difference between the wad of cloth with 
worms and that without worms. 
“To ascertain what receptive organs were concerned in the reac- 
tions just described, two sets of 5 fishes each were taken from 
among the 15 normal fishes already tested, and each set was pre- 
pared differently by subjecting its members to a special operation. 
One set. was etnerized, and, through a small incision between the 
eyes, their olfactory tracts were cut, thus rendering their olfactory 
apparatus functionless. From fishes of the other set all the barblets 
were removed, whereby their external gustatory organs were partly, 
though not wholly, eliminated. After these operations both sets of 
fishes were liberated in the large aquarium, where they remained 
for over two days At the expiration of this time, they were care- 
fully inspected and tested. They swam about in an essentially 
normal way and members of both sets snapped bits of worm from the 
end of a hooked wire much as a normal fish does. Presumably they 
were in a satisfactory condition for experimentation. 
“The tests were begun by introducing into the large aquarium 
containing the 10 fishes a wad of cheesecloth within which were 
hidden some minced earthworms and recording the kind of fish 
that visited it and the nature of their reactions. During the first 
hour the wad was seized 34 times by fishes without barblets but

SENSE OF SMELL-IN FISHES 411 
with normal olfactory. organs and, though often passed by fishes 
with cut olfactory tracts, it was ‘nosed’ only once by one of these. 
A wad of cheesecloth without worms was next substituted for that 
with worms and the reactions of the fishes were recorded for a 
second hour. Though members of both sets frequently swam by this 
wad, none at any time during the hour seized it or even nosed it. 
These tests were repeated on the same fishes for two succeeding 
days and with essentially similar results. On the second day the 
wad with worms was seized 16 times during the test hour by fishes 
with normal olfactory organs and on the third day 54 times. On 
both these days the fishes with their olfactory tracts cut made no 
attempts on the wad with worms nor did any fish at any time nose 
the wormless wad. The movements of the two sets of fishes when 
in the neighborhood of the wad containing minced worms were 
characteristically different. The fishes with their olfactory tracts 
cut swam by the wads without noticeable change; those without 
barblets, but with their olfactory apparatus intact almost always 
made several sharp turns when near the wad as though seeking 
something, and then either moved slowly away or swam more or 
less directly to the wad and began to nose and nibble it. These 
reactions were so clear and so characteristic that when taken in 
connection with the conditions of the fishes, they lead inevitably to 
the conclusion that the olfactory apparatus of the catfish is service- 
able in sensing food at a distance much beyond that at which the 
organs of taste are capable of acting; in other words, catfish truly 
scent their food.” 
The reactions of the killifish under such conditions offer 
enough points of difference to require noting. It, in con- 
trast both to the catfish and the dogfish, uses its eyes as 
well as its nose in seeking food. If a small piece of dogfish 
is dropped into a pool containing the killifish they imme- 
diately spring toward it—too suddenly to suppose that 
diffusion could have taken place to such an extent that the 
olfactory system could be stimulated. Even if a ball of 
filter paper is thrown into the tank they dart forward and 
seize it, but soon discard it. It is the eye likewise which 
makes them dart forward and seize a packet of plain cheese- 
cloth. On account of their use of vision it is hard to make 
conclusive experiments upon their olfactory sensitivity un- 
less they are blinded at the same time that they are made 
anosmic. On account of the fact that in normal fish plain 
cheesecloth packets are soon discarded, it is possible to test 
the effect of cutting the olfactory nerves. Anosmic animals, 
when tested with two packets, the one containing hidden 
meat and the other without food, nibble at both packets
-P-A-G-E-426
  412 TASTE 
in such a way that an uninformed observer could not tell 
which contains food. When these same two packets are 
placed before normal animals the food packet becomes 
immediately surrounded by a vigorous assemblage of con- 
testing individuals.* 
II. Taste 
Location of gustatory organs.—The gustatory organs 
in certain fishes have a widespread distribution. In addi- 
tion to the taste buds, which are found in the mouths of 
fishes, we find them frequently upon the lips, the outer 
skin of the head and on the trunk. In Ameiurus it has 
been shown that the terminal buds occur in the skin of 
practically the whole body surface but especially on the 
barblets. These terminal buds must be sharply distin- 
guished from the sensory structures in the lateral line sys- 
tem, which they resemble rather closely (p. 394). The 
sensory nerve supply to the terminal buds of the mouth 
is shared in by X, IX, and VII pairs of cranial nerves; 
those of the bodily surface (Ameiurus) largely by the lat- 
eral accessory branch of the VII cranial nerve. 
Herrick’s experiments upon the functional signifi- 
cance of the taste buds.—In the discussion of the func- 
tional significance of the taste buds we shall consider 
mainly the experiments which have been made upon the 
catfish (Ameiurus). As has been stated, this animal rarely 
uses its eyes in the search for food. If, in the course of 
random and aimless movements, the fish pass near the sides 
and bottom of the aquarium which contains food, they 
touch the food with the lips or barblets, and instantly 
seize and swallow it. They are easily frightened and ex- 
perimentation is difficult. If one arranges the aquarium 
so that the fish may partially conceal themselves, leaving 
certain of the fins and other parts uncovered, it is possible 
to make experiments which show the functions of these 
*More recently still Copeland has found that the puffer 
(Spheroides maculatus) shows the same ability to respond to con- 
cealed food. His method of determining this fact was essentially 
like that of Parker.
-P-A-G-E-427
  FUNCTION OF TASTE BUDS 413 
taste buds. If, under these conditions, a piece of meat is 
lowered so that it touches the barblet, the meat is instantly 
seized and swallowed. Touching any part of the body, 
head or tail, produces the same reaction. Vision is not 
necessary to set off the reflex of seizing and swallowing. 
From the above experiments we are not able to devide 
whether touch or taste is the functional sense. When they 
are touched with cotton wool on any part of the body 
under similar conditions, they will likewise turn and seize 
the wool, but soon drop it. If, now, one continues stimu- 
lating them with cotton wool, they cease to respond. When 
they have become habituated to the contact with the wool, 
one again tries them with meat. Invariably the response 
is called out. It is evident that both senses participate. 
The response is both a tactual and a gustatory reflex. The 
gustatory reflex is obtained (after tactual accommoda- 
tion) if the cotton wool is soaked with meat juice. In order 
to produce typical gustatory reflexes, the stimulus must 
be strong and localized. Diffusion of juices called forth 
only seeking movements. While the olfactory receptors 
may have participated in these reactions, it is quite prob- 
able that they would have occurred in anosmic animals. 
While Herrick did not section the olfactory nerves in the 
catfish, he did perform such an operation on several tom- 
cods (Microgadus tomcod). From the second day after the 
operation the animals fed normally. Furthermore, 
“ After the third or fourth day the fishes took their food in all 
respects like uninjured fishes, so far as could be observed. They 
gave all of the characteristic reflexes that have been mentioned above, 
including the discrimination between cotton wool and cotton dipped 
in clam juice, and between sea water and clam juice applied with a 
pipette, ete. The operated fish would locate a concealed bait by 
means of pelvic fins exactly as the normal fish does, and he would 
similarly root it out and eat it. In short, the gustatory reflexes, so 
far as I have observed them, were absolutely unmodified by the 
‘Similar tests upon the pollack (Pollackhius vires), hake 
(Urophycis tenuis), and the tomeod (Microgadus tomcod) have 
yielded similar results. The pollack has very well developed eyes 
and darts for the food when he sees it. Sight plays a large part in 
its daily life. It is not well suited to experiments upon taste. The 
fins are very sensitive to meat.

operation. That the olfactory apparatus was totally destroyed was 
verified by autopsy dissections made after the close of the observa- 
tions.” * 
Parker’s experiments upon the gustatory responses of 
fishes.—Parker’s own experiments confirm the work of 
Herrick and afford some additional facts. He investigated 
the sense of taste in the common hornpout. The taste buds 
in this form occur not only in the mouth and in the bar- 
bules but also over most of the external surface. Those 
on the exterior of the fish are innervated by the branches 
of the seventh nerve. Hornpouts will snap at a bait when 
it is presented to the flank of the body as well as when it 
is close to the mouth. The exterior of the body is sensitive 
to sour, saline, and alkaline solutions, the head being 
more sensitive than the trunk. In hornpouts, if the 
branches of the seventh nerve distributed to the skin have 
been cut, thus destroying the sensitivity of the skin, there 
is no longer a response to bait brought near to the trunk 
though the same bait is eagerly taken when brought near to 
the mouth. Such animals, however, retain their full sen- 
sitiveness to sour, saline, and alkaline solutions when ap- 
plied to the skin of the trunk. The loss of sensitivity to 
bait is not due to shock. They still snap at the bait if the 
lateral branch of the tenth nerve has been cut. After cut- 
ting the lateral branches of the seventh and tenth nerves 
the only sensory nerves left intact on the flanks of the 
body are the branches of the spinal nerves. Fish in this 
condition still respond to sour, saline, and alkaline solu- 
tions. It follows that these solutions must stimulate 
the terminals of the spinal nerves and that these 
‘While there is a seeming contradiction between these experiments 
and those cited from Parker and Sheldon on p. 409, it may partially he removed by supposing that the tomcod has an extraordinarily finely 
developed Sense of taste in its pelvic fins—so highly developed, indeed, that it functions like a distance receptor. Neither Parker nor’ Sheldon worked with this form. Parker worked with the catfish, having its olfactory mechanism as the chief point of interest, while Herrick was 
interested mainly in the gustatory mechanism. Their results are not 
strictly in harmony. It is unfortunate that Herrick did not work with 
anosmic catfish. Even allowing for the apparent contradiction it would 
seem that both investigators have made their respective points, viz., that 
the terminal buds distributed over the bodily surface are ‘true taste structures (Herrick) and that the olfactory mechanism serves as a distance 
receptor (Parker).
-P-A-G-E-429
  “COMMON CHEMICAL SENSE’ IN FISHES 415 
nerves must be regarded as chemical in function, though 
they are not primarily concerned in the response to bait. 
In hornpouts, the posterior half of whose spinal cord has 
been destroyed but whose seventh nerve is intact, there is 
no response when sour, saline, and alkaline solutions and 
bait are applied to the flanks and neer the tail. The 
absence of response to batt in this experiment Parker be- 
lieves to be due to the loss of the motor mechanism of the 
cord whereby the fish turns to snap at the bait and not to 
the loss of the spinal sensory fibers. The loss of these fibers 
would account for the absence of response to sour, saline; 
and alkaline solutions. Parker believes that the sense of 
taste is complex and involves not only the seventh nerve 
but also the spinal nerves; i.e., that there is both a sense of 
taste and a ‘‘ common chemical sense.’’ This conception, 
which does some violence to the common notion of the 
function of cutaneous receptors, should be carefully con- 
sidered. 
III. Tue ‘‘ Common Cuemicau SENSE ”’ IN FISHES 
Introduction.—There is a growing tendency to use the 
term ‘‘ chemical sense ’’ generically and to make it include 
smell, taste, and a sense which may be described as the 
““ common chemical sense.’’ While this usage seems unde- 
sirable it is impossible to discuss certain experimental 
results without using at least the term ‘‘ common chemical 
sense.’’ This is especially true when we come to treat of 
the responses of fish, amphibia, and the invertebrates to 
chemical substances. It is asserted (Sheldon) that the 
““ceommon chemical sense ’’ is entirely different from the 
ordinary cutaneous system, and that all vertebrates from 
the lancelet to man possess it (as well as all invertebrates). 
In man the receptors for this organ lie especially on the 
exposed mucous surfaces such as those of the nasal cham- 
bers, the mouth cavity, and the moist surfaces of the eye- 
lids. Parker states that ‘‘ the receptors on these surfaces 
are normally stimulated by the chemical action of the ma- 
terial in direct contact with them and they represent col- 
 
-P-A-G-E-430
    416 ‘“COMMON CHEMICAL SENSE ” 
lectively a sense as distinct and well defined as smell or 
taste.’’ The work on human sensory physiology within 
recent years has tended to show that there are four dis- 
tinct kinds of cutaneous receptors—stimulated respectively 
by (1) pressure, (2) cold, (3) warm, and (4) noxious sub- 
stances. These may be stimulated separately or simul- 
taneously. Furthermore, there is some positive evidence 
(von Frey and others) that the hairs and Meissner cor- 
puscles mediate pressure responses, while the end bulb type 
of corpuscle mediates cold, and the Ruffini cylinder and re- 
lated types mediate warm stimuli. The free nerve endings 
are supposed to be stimulated by noxious substances, acids, 
cuts, burns, bruises, ete. This whole system is collectively 
called the ‘‘ cutaneous sense.’? It would seem that our 
present concept of this sense is adequate and that the use 
of the term ‘‘ common chemical sense ’’ is confusing. There 
has been no distinction made between the external skin and 
the skin bathed by mucus. The experimental work of Head 
and Sherren (and of Rivers), however clearly it may show 
that our former ideas of localization of impulses in the cord 
were in error and that motor nerve trunks carry sensory 
fibers, does not seriously modify our ideas of the nature of 
the external cutaneous system. That the cutaneous system, 
as we understand that term in man, exists unchanged 
through the vertebrate series, we do not for a moment claim 
(especially in view of the fact that highly organized sensory 
terminals like those found in man apparently do not exist 
in the skin of the fish). The experiments of Parker and of 
Sheldon on fish tend to establish the view that differences 
do exist between man and certain of the lower vertebrates. 
Sheldon’s experiments upon the smooth dogfish.—The 
older experiments upon the ‘‘ common chemical sense ’’ in 
fish (e.g., Nagel’s) are unsatisfactory because they failed to 
make any distinction between those forms which possess 
taste buds only in the mouth cavities, and those which 
possess such terminals on the bodily surfaces. Sheldon 
worked only upon the smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis), 
which possesses. taste buds only in the mouth cavities. The 
sensitivity of the whole bodily surface to chemical stimuli

““COMMON CHEMICAL SENSE”’ IN FISHES 417 
was tested as well as the mouth and nasal capsules, and the 
nerves mediating the reactions were determined. The chem- 
ieals used were hydrochloric, nitric, and sulphuric acids for 
acid stimuli; sodium, ammonium, and lithium chlorides for 
saline stimuli; sodium hydroxide for alkaline; cane sugar, 
dextrose, saccharine, and its carbonates for sweet; and 
quinine hydrochloride, picric acid, ammonium and sodium 
picrates for bitter. The solutions were applied by means 
of a pipette. They were ejected slowly with the tip of the 
pipette 2 mm. from the skin of the fish. Stimulation of 
the mouth or spiracles is followed (when the stimulus is 
effective) by one or more violent gulps accompanied by a 
quick ejection of water through the bronchial openings 
and more rapid respiration. When the nostrils were stimu- 
lated there followed a quick jerk of the head. Stimulation 
of the different fins likewise produced characteristic re- 
actions. Stimulation of the dorsal, lateral, and ventral 
surfaces results in a movement which is a part of the gen- 
eral swimming movement. In general it may be stated that 
all parts of the body are very sensitive to acids and alkalis 
in very dilute solutions, less sensitive to salt and bitter 
substances, and not sensitive at all to sugars. Certain parts 
of the bodily surface are more sensitive to salts and alkalis 
than is the mouth. The outer skin and the mouth are 
equally sensitive to acids, while the mouth is more sensitive 
to bitter substances. In regard to the nerves mediating 
the response to chemical stimuli it may be stated that when 
the cord is destroyed the caudal part of the body becomes 
insensitive. This shows that the lateral line organs do not 
participate in these reactions (since destruction of the cord 
does not affect them). When the cord is merely severed 
from the brain the response to chemical stimuli is more 
* These were made up in distilled water on the basis of the gram- 
molecular solution. The inorganie acids were prepared as normal 
solutions, titrated against an alkali of known strength for accuracy. 
The other solutions were made up by weight, the concentration first 
used as a test depending partly on the solubility of the chemical 
used. The chlorides were prepared as 5n solutions, the sugar, 3n, 
sodium hydroxide as n, saccharine n/6, quinine hydrochloride n/10, 
picric and its salts n/15. These solutions were gradually diluted 
until the limit of reaction was reached.

  418 ““COMMON CHEMICAL SENSE ” 
marked than before. Sectioning of that part of the fifth 
nerve which supplies the nasal passages (ramus mazillaris 
trigemini) produces insensitivity to chemical stimuli in 
that region, thus showing that the olfactory nerves do not 
participate in the reactions. Sheldon finds evidence that 
the ‘‘ common chemical sense ”’ is likewise distinct from the 
tactual sense. This evidente may be summarized as follows: 
Parts of the body may be fatigued for tactual stimuli and 
remain sensitive to chemical stimuli, but when any region 
is fatigued for a given chemical stimulus it no longer or 
rarely is sensitive to tactual stimuli. It usually remains 
sensitive to other forms of chemical stimuli, however. 
When cocaine is applied response to tactile stimuli dis- 
appears before response to chemical. Among chemical 
stimuli, sensitivity to bitter disappears first. These results 
are supposed to furnish evidence that the cutaneous mech- 
anism is separate from that of the ‘‘ common chemical 
sense.’’ Similar experiments have been carried out upon 
the catfish (Ameiurus) and upon Ammocetes by Parker, 
with results which confirm those of Sheldon. 
“Common chemical sense” in amphibia—The com- 
mon leopard frog (Rana pipiens Schreber) reacts to chemi- 
cals much as does the fish. Cole, who made the tests, pre- 
pared brainless frogs and dipped them to the ankle in a 
given solution. After a few seconds the leg would be 
withdrawn in case the stimulus was effective. A frog 
dipped into distilled water does not so withdraw the leg. 
Solutions of the chlorides of ammonium, potassium, sodium, 
and lithium were found to be effective stimuli. Since these 
same solutions produce gustatory reactions in man, the 
question arises here, as in the case of the fish, does the frog’s 
skin possess a general chemical sense comparable with the 
special sense of taste? Cole is inclined to answer this 
question in the affirmative, since he was able to show that 
frogs which had been coeainized until pain reactions were 
abolished still responded at least once to the chemical 
stimulus (a 3 m. solution of ammonium chloride). 
Summary.—While it has been shown beyond question 
that both the fish and the frog (spinal) are sensitive to
-P-A-G-E-433
  
SUMMARY 419 
acids on bodily surfaces, the experiments of Sheldon and 
Cole do not conclusively militate against the view that these 
reactions are mediated by the pressure-cold-warm-pain 
terminals (and apparently there are such specificities even 
though the sensory endings are not highly differentiated. 
See work of Hofer, p. 428). Their results can possibly be 
harmonized with the view that these receptors do mediate 
the response to acids by supposing that any or all of such 
terminals may be ‘‘ inadequately ’’ stimulated by the solu- 
tions; that their threshold of sensitivity is markedly altered 
by the chemicals; and that when superficial terminals are 
destroyed or otherwise made insensitive (fatigued?) the 
deep-lying cutaneous structures together with the kines- 
thetic (muscle spindles or their homologs, ete.) begin to 
function. However, Herrick supposes that the ‘‘ common 
chemical sense ’’ is the primitive one from which the ol- 
factory and gustatory have been differentiated.”

Cutaneous sensitivity in mammals.—Many mammals 
are well supplied with highly developed tactual mechanisms, 
such as hairy coats, vibrisse, etc. No mammal seems to be 
lacking completely in hairs. The vibrisse seem to be highly 
specialized tactual organs which play a considerable réle in 
the daily life of many animals. It has been supposed that 
such specialized tactile organs are to be found mainly upon 
nocturnal animals. This position, however, cannot seri- 
ously be maintained. Vincent has made a careful histo- 
logical study of the vibrisse of the rat. Fig. 67 shows the 
structure of such a hair. Its rich sensory innervation and 
large arterial supply are apparent. 
In addition to the tactile hairs, mammals are well sup- 
plied with highly specialized sensory endings in the dermal 
and muscular tissues. Vincent’s investigation of the func- 
tion of the vibrisse in the daily life of the rat, and espe- 
cially in learning problems, the solution of which is de- 
pendent upon the functioning of the vibrisse, is the only 
comprehensive study we have upon the contact sense of 
animals. She constructed a simple maze, the runways to 
which were without sidepieces (restraining walls). The 
runways (4” boards lying horizontally) were placed far 
enough apart to keep the animal from jumping from

one to the other. The maze was then raised 2 feet from 
the floor. The normal animals behave characteristically 
in this maze. In moving off after being put on the 
runway they go at first along the very edge of the board

and run with noses against the floor. The animals moved 
slowly at first, so there were few falls. Shortly bursts of

speed occurred and then falls became numerous at the turns. 
Finally, as in the Hampton Court maze (p. 103),the animals 
became automatic. The three photographs from Vincent’s 
monograph show respectively a normal animal, a blind 
rat without vibrissx, and a blind rat with vibrisse. The in- 
fluence of the vibrisse can be thrown into relief by cutting 
them from one side. Strange to say when the vibrisse are 
absent on the right side the animals keep close to the left

side of the path, and vice versa. When running they pass 
to the edge, turn the remaining vibrisse down, and follow 
the edges closely. Vincent has shown further that white 
rats can form the habit of entering an alley with corrugated 
sides when two smooth alleys are offered at the same time. 
Tactile hairs are much utilized in the learning of this prob- 
lem. When robbed of them the animal makes use of the 
bare snout. When the snout is made insensitive by cutting 
the infra-orbital nerve it can no longer form such habits,

It is evident from this work that the vibrissz are functional 
structures and that they serve as (short) distance recep- 
tors. The so-called ‘‘ stereotropism ’’ which such animals 
exhibit is probably no more a case of stereotropism than is 
the action of a blind man in keeping near a wall or the 
edge of the sidewalk. Experiments of Nicolai, where the 
salivary reflex was used as the indicator, show apparently

that the dog is sensitive to mechanical stimuli and that the 
localization of such stimuli is accurate. 
Hahn’s experiments on bats.—For a long time it has 
been known that blind, anosmic, and deaf bats were able 
to avoid objects in their way and even to avoid silken 
threads stretched closely together. Hahn, in his more re- 
cent work, states that the older experiments are lacking 
in scientific accuracy since none of his bats, even with sense 
organs intact, was able to do what has been claimed by the 
earlier experimenters for maimed animals. To test the 
mechanism by means of which they avoid obstacles, Hahn  
-P-A-G-E-439
  CONTACT SENSE IN BATS 425 
made the following tests: Bats were liberated in an un- 
ceiled room 15’ wide, 18’ long, 9’ from floor to eaves, 
12’ from apex to ceiling. Pieces of black annealed iron 
wire 1 mm. in diameter were suspended from the rafters. 
These were spaced so that there was one wire to each 11” 
of space. The animals were tested under four conditions: 
(1) With eyes covered with glue and lamp-black; (2) with 
external ears and tragi excised; (3) with external auditory 
meatus stopped with plaster of Paris; and (4) with hairs of

It is evident that vision does not play a large part. It is 
stated by Hahn that the “‘ perception ”’ of a stationary ob- 
ject is probably due to the condensation of the air between 
the flying bat and the solid object that it is approaching— 4 
 
-P-A-G-E-440

the drum membrane functioning chiefly as a contact organ. 
He states also that the fine bodily hairs have a function in 
the avoidance of objects. 
The “sense of support ” in mammals.—In experiments 
upon rats, chicks, turtles, and many other vertebrates the 
influence of the contact sense is apparent in their be- 
havior when placed on the edge of table-tops, ete. In trying 
to get blind rats to jump from one platform to another, 
Richardson found that ‘‘ up to a certain distance the rat 
was able to step across with little difficulty ; and the con- 
tact of the snout or vibrisse with platform II. seemed to 
be the essential stimulus in the majority of cases.’’ 
Se . This (blind) rat would not allow his forefeet to 
leave the platform unless his vibrisse reported contact 
with some object. When the platform was beyond the 
reach of his vibrissw, the experimenter touched their tips 
with a pencil, whereupon he put out his forefeet to step 
over.’’ Small finds the tendency to withdraw from the edge 
of the table strong in very young rats. The guinea pig 
seems to be lacking in such reflexes. Chicks and reptiles 
seemed to be influenced in such situations more by visual 
than by contact stimuli. (See p. 362 for Yerkes’ experi- 
ment on tortoise.) 
Yoakum’s experiments upon the temperature sense in 
mammals.—Yoakum has tested the temperature sense of 
gray squirrels and white rats by forcing them to form the 
habit of entering the warmer of two boxes. The apparatus 
used is shown on p. 92. The warmer box (Standard) was 
kept at 40°+2°C., the other (Variable) at 15°+2°C. . 
When the habit was perfected the temperature of the 
Variable was raised to 25°+2°C. The habit was again 
perfected. The temperature of the Variable was then 
changed to 30°+2°C. The experiment had to be inter- 
rupted at this point, but it was carried far enough to show 
that the difference limen had not been reached. <A similar 
series of experiments was carried out upon white rats with 
the temperatures S=40°+ 2° C. and V=24°+2° C. The 
rats readily learned to enter the warmer of the two boxes 
under such conditions, The D.L. to temperature was not

obtained. Both these animals will pile up cotton, straws, 
ete., to form a nest when the room temperature is lowered 
considerably. While stimuli other than temperature will 
call out this burrowing response, it probably is often called 
out by changes of temperature in the room. Yoakum de- 
scribes the behavior of the squirrel as follows: 
“The animal’s method of covering itself is interesting. The squir- 
rel will draw the shavings, or cotton, up in a pile in one corner of 
the cage, and will then burrow into it. When finally hidden in the 
pile, all that is visible is a portion of the tail; if this is drawn 
aside the tip of the nose and finally the entire head becomes visible. 
The little animal thus lies curled up in its nest with the tail as the 
final addition to its covering.” 
Nicolai states that when cold is applied to a particular 
spot on the skin of the dog a conditioned reflex is called 
forth. If the cold is applied to any other spot, the reflex 
again follows, showing that localization is not very exact. 
By the same method it has been shown that the dog is sen- 
sitive to warmth and that cold may be reacted to differ- 
ently from warmth. 
Contact sensitivity in fish—Of contact sensitivity in 
fish in the narrower sense (pressure-temperature-pain) we 
know very little. Running through the experiments of 
Bateson, Baglioni, Herrick, Parker, and Sheldon we find 
abundant proof of the sensitivity to contact—to solid objects 
and to cotton wool, ete., but the observations have been more 
or less incidental. Herrick has brought out the fact that fish, 
which at first always respond to cotton wool, will eventu- 
ally learn to inhibit response to this and to react only when 
stimulated with food objects. Baglioni finds in the trigger 
fish, Balistes capriscus, that the skin of the fins and of the 
upper anterior surface of the spine, stimulation of which 
causes erection of the spine, are quite sensitive to contacts. 
In the dog fish, Scyllium, the following regions are quite 
sensitive: the immediate neighborhood of the outer gill 
slits, stimulation of which causes respiratory reflexes; the 
neighborhood of the spiracles; the regions around the eyes, 
and the skin of the lids, stimulation of which produces 
closure of the lids. The external surface of the skin as a  
-P-A-G-E-442
  428 CUTANEOUS SENSE 
whole was found to be insensitive. Hofer, however, has 
shown experimentally that the fish has tactile spots and 
warm spots upon the skin of the head but not in the skin 
of other regions. Lyon has made experiments on the fish’s 
ability to orient to currents in the water when in darkness. 
He had previously shown that the fish swims against the 
current (head up stream) through visual reflexes (p. 361). 
‘When tested in darkness the same reaction was observed, 
due to the contacts between the body of the fish and sta- 
tionary objects. In the light of Hofer’s work on the func- 
tion of the lateral line organs it is probable that Lyon’s con- 
clusions will need confirmation. 
Contact and temperature sensitivity in amphibia—The 
eontact and temperature sensitivity of the frog is some- 
what better known. It has even been stated (Steinach) 
that the frog possesses ‘‘ touch spots ’’ but the evidence 
is far from being conclusive. Babak has recently studied 
the temperature sense of the frog by a new and very sen- 
sitive method which promises to be very useful in behavior. 
He has found that the breathing rhythm of a frog with the 
fore-brain removed proceeds with machine-like regularity, 
interrupted only when the animal is stimulated and re- 
sumed shortly after the stimulating agent is removed. In 
the maimed frog lung ventilation also occurs only after 
stimulation. In his first paper upon the sensitivity of the 
frog, the second of a series of studies upon the breathing 
rhythm, the author takes up the sensitivity of the animal 
to temperature as determined by changes in the breathing 
rate. The animals used had completely recovered from 
the shock resulting from operation upon the brain. The 
temperature stimuli were applied by means of the thermes- 
thesiometer held at a distance of 1 mm. from the animal’s 
skin. The actual temperature changes in the skin could 
be judged only approximately. During experimentation 
great care was required to avoid auditory and tactile 
stimuli, ete. The specimens studied were found to be sen- 
sitive to slight changes in either direction from the physio- 
logical zero point. For comparison Babak obtained the 
threshold in human beings by applying the temperature
-P-A-G-E-443
  
THE ORGANIC SENSE 429 
stimulus 1 mm. from the skin surface. The frogs, if the 
above reaction may be taken as an indicator, are fully as 
sensitive as man. The head region is most sensitive. It 
is possible by this method to work out a complete to- 
pography of dermal temperature sensitivity. The experi- 
ments of Yerkes on the auditory-tactual reactions of the 
frog have already been noted on p. 388. 
II. Tue Organic System 
There seems to be no way at present whereby we can 
deal with organic responses in isolation. In one way organic 
stimuli and the responses to such are fundamental and 
basal—behavior to visual, auditory, and other sense stimuli 
is conditioned by the organic situation in which the animal 
finds itself. Physiology has claimed this province particu- 
larly. In recent years this science has shown itself amply 
competent to work out the many delicate problems which 
are inherent in. this field. The work of Cannon and 
his students and of Carlson upon the nature of the muscu- 
lar contractions of the stomach in the absence of food; of 
Cannon on the effect of fear and rage on the secretion of 
glycogen; and finally. of Osborne and Mendel on the 
factors influencing growth are producing results which 
certainly bear as directly upon behavior problems as they 
do upon more strictly physiological problems. On p. 25 
we touched upon the possibility of carrying out ex- 
perimental work upon the influence of the ‘‘ sexual 
state ’’ upon the general reactions of the animal. There 
seems to be no good reason why we should not study 
habit formation in animals robbed of the efferent nerve 
supply to these regions (and hence robbed of ‘‘ re- 
turn ’’ or sensory impulses). Already there is a cer- 
tain amount of work upon the structural changes which 
occur in a developing organism when ovariotomy is re- 
sorted to and upon ovarian transplantations. The interest 
in such experiments, however, has been morphological. It 
is probable that the whole instinctive repertoire shifts 
in such cases and that the mechanism of habit formation is
-P-A-G-E-444
  430 KINASTHETIC SENSE 
profoundly modified. When we look for a moment at the 
behavior complexes present in migration, mating, hiberna- 
tion, etc., we can see that there must be rhythmical intra- 
organic factors which must be taken account of even by 
one who is primarily engaged in observing the behavior of 
animals to extra-organic stimuli. Jennings has well 
brought out the necessity of the study of such processes in 
investigating the behavior of lower organisms. The neces- 
sity of study in these fields is not less when we deal with the 
vertebrates. It is here primarily that the behaviorist and 
the physiologist meet. The behaviorist has not the equip- 
ment and the technique to engage in such studies and he 
must await the needed results at the hands of the physiol- 
ogist. 
Iii. Tue Kinzstuetic System 
If we made the statement that all of the work upon habit 
formation in all of the behavior laboratories (excepting the 
studies upon birds) points to the fact that the kinesthetic 
sense is the most important system of receptors, and yet 
that there was not one single thing that we could say about 
this sense in isolation, paradoxical as it might seem, it 
would not be far from the truth. When the author’s ex- 
periments upon blind, anosmic, and deaf rats were made 
some twelve years ago, where it was shown that the daily 
lives of such animals were little affected by the loss of 
these distance receptors, it seemed to be a very special case. 
Since that time the view that the kinesthetic sense is the 
one most depended upon by animals where possible (i.e., 
that kinesthetic data are substituted for auditory, visual, 
and olfactory) has been confirmed by similar experiments 
upon many other forms. We need only to call attention to 
the fact that ‘‘ place ’’ or position habits develop rapidly in 
nearly all tests upon vision, audition, olfaction, ete. We 
have even found it necessary to handicap or penalize this 
sense by the introduction of punishment in order to give 
the distance sense stimuli a chance to influence the organ- 
ism. The kinesthetic system is peculiar with respect to the
-P-A-G-E-445
  FUNCTION OF KINAISTHETIC SENSE 431 
fact that we must work with it by the method of exclusion. 
We can eliminate by several methods the influence of vision, 
audition, and the other senses, but in view of the fact that 
the muscle is both the effector and the receptor we cannot 
isolate the receptor features without eliminating the possi- 
bility of obtaining diversified response. For this reason we 
cannot now view the functions of the various parts of this 
complex system in isolation (i.e, determine the relative 
importance in habit formation of muscular receptors, ten- 
donous receptors, ete.). The tremendous importance of 
kinezsthesis in adjustment is not limited to the lower or> 
ganisms. There is a growing tendency to make it respon- 
sible for man’s so-called reactions to objects which are not 
(at the moment of reaction extra-organically) present. 
‘We mean here merely to reiterate the view already several 
times expressed that there are no centrally aroused sensa- 
tions and that even in ‘‘ thought ”’ there is always a move- 
ment of a muscular mass somewhere, presumably usually 
in the laryngeal and related mechanisms.

PREFACE 
F I have essayed to do in this book what should 
have been done by one of the masters of the science 
of folklore—Mr. Frazer, Mr. Lang, Mr. Hartland, 
Mr. Clodd, Sir John Rhys, and others—I hope it will 
not be put down to any feelings of self-sufficiency on 
my part. I have greatly dared because no one of them 
has accomplished, and I have so acted because I feel 
the necessity of some guidance in these matters, and 
more particularly at the present stage of inquiry into 
the early history of man. 
I have thought I could give somewhat of that 
guidance because of my comprehension of its need, for 
the comprehension of a need is sometimes half-way 
towards supplying the need. My profound belief in 
the value of folklore as perhaps the only means of } 
discovering the earliest stages of the psychological, | 
religious, social, and political history of modern man ‘| 
has also entered into my reason for the attempt. 
Many years ago I suggested the necessity for guid- 
ance, and I sketched out a few of the points involved 
(Folklore Journal, ii. 285, 347; iii. 1-16) in what was 
afterwards called by a friendly critic a sort of grammar 
of folklore. The science of folklore has advanced far 
since 1885 however, and not only new problems but 
new ranges of thought have gathered round it. Still, 
xi
-P-A-G-E-10
  xii FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
the claims of folklore as a definite section of historical 
material remain not only unrecognised but unstated, 
and as long as this is so the lesser writers on folklore will 
go on working in wrong directions and producing much 
mischief, and the historian will judge of folklore by the 
criteria presented by these writers—will judge wrongly 
and will neglect folklore accordingly. 
I hope this book may tend to correct this state of 
things to some extent. Itis not easy to write on such 
a subject in a limited space, and it is difficult to avoid 
being somewhat severely technical at points. These 
demerits will, 1am sure, be forgiven when considered 
by the light of the human interest involved. 
All studies of this kind must begin from the stand- 
point of a definite culture area, and I have chosen our 
own country for the purpose of this inquiry. This 
will make the illustrations more interesting to the 
English reader; but it must be borne in mind that 
the same process could be repeated for other areas 
if my estimate of the position is even tolerably accu- 
rate. For the purpose of this estimate it was neces- 
sary, in the first place, to show how pure history was 
intimately related to folklore at many stages, and 
yet how this relationship had been ignored by both 
historian and folklorist. The research for this purpose 
had necessarily to deal with much detail, and to 
introduce fresh elements of research. There is thus 
produced a somewhat unequal treatment; for when 
illustrations have to be worked out at length, because 
they appear for the first time, the mind is apt to wander 
from the main point at issue and to become lost in the 
subordinate issue arising from the working out of the

chosen illustration. This, I fear, is inevitable in 
folklore research, and I can only hope I have overcome 
some of the difficulties caused thereby in a fairly satis- 
factory manner. 
The next stage takes us to a consideration of 
materials and methods, in order to show the means and 
definitions which are necessary if folklore research is 
to be conducted on scientific lines. Not only is it 
necessary to ascertain the proper position of each 
item of folklore in the culture area in which it is found, 
but it is also necessary to ascertain its scientific 
relationship to other items found in the same area; 
and I have protested against the too easy attempt to 
proceed upon the comparative method. Before we 
can compare we must be certain that we are comparing 
like quantities. 
These chapters are preliminary. After this stage we 
proceed to the principal issues, and the first of these 
deals with the psychological conditions. It was only 
necessary to treat of this subject shortly, because the 
illustrations of it do not need analysis. They are 
self-contained, and supply their own evidence as to the 
place they occupy. 
The anthropological conditions involve very differ- 
ent treatment. The great fact necessary to bear in 
mind is that the people of a modern culture area have 
an anthropological as well as a national or political 
history, and that it is only the anthropological history 
which can explain the meaning and existence of 
folklore. This subject found me compelled to go 
rather more deeply than I had thought would be 
necessary into first principles, but I hope I have not
-P-A-G-E-12
  xiv FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
altogether failed to prove that to properly understand 
the province of folklore it is necessary to know 
something of anthropological research and its results. 
In point of fact, without this consideration of folklore, 
there is not much value to be obtained from it. It is 
not because it consists of traditions, superstitions, 
customs, beliefs, observances, and what not, that 
folklore is of value to science. It is because the 
various constituents are survivals of something much 
more essential to mankind than fragments of life which 
for all practical purposes of progress might well 
disappear from the world. As survivals, folklore 
belongs to anthropological data, and if, as I contend, we 
can go so far back into survivals as totemism, we must 
understand generally what position totemism occupies 
among human institutions, and to understand this we 
must fall back to human origins. 
The next divisions are more subordinate. Socio- 
logical conditions must be studied apart from their 
anthropological aspect, because in the higher races the 
social group is knit together far more strongly and 
with far greater purpose than among the lower races. 
The social force takes the foremost place among the 
influences towards the higher development, and it is 
necessary not only to study this but to be sure of the 
terms we use. Tribe, clan, family, and other terms 
have been loosely used in anthropology, just as state, 
city, village, and now village-community, are loosely 
used in history. The great fact to understand is that 
the social group of the higher races was based on 
blood kinship at the time when they set out to take 
their place in modern civilisation, and that we cannot
-P-A-G-E-13
  
PREFACE Xv 
understand survivals in folklore unless we test them by 
their position as part of a tribal organisation. The 
point has never been taken before, and yet I do not see 
how it can be dismissed. 
The consideration of European conditions is chiefly 
concerned with the all-important fact of an intrusive 
religion, that of Christianity, from without, destroying 
the native religions with which it came into contact, 
conditions which would of course apply only to the 
folklore of European countries. 
Finally, I have discussed ethnological conditions in 
order to show that certain fundamental differences in 
folklore can be and ought to be explained as the results 
of different race origins. We are now getting rid of 
the notion that all Europe is peopled by the descendants 
of the so-called Aryans. There is too much evidence 
to show that the still older races lived on after they were 
conquered by Celt, Teuton, Scandinavian, or Slav, and 
there is no reason why folklore should not share with 
language, archeology, and physical type the inheritance 
from this earliest race. 
In this manner I have surveyed the several condi- 
tions attachable to the study of folklore and the 
various departments of science with which it is in- 
separably associated. Folklore cannot be studied 
alone. Alone it is of little worth. As part of the 
inheritance from bygone ages it cannot separate itself 
from the conditions of bygone ages. Those who 
would study it carefully, and with purpose, must con- 
sider it in the light which is shed by it and upon it 
from all that is contributory to the history of man. 
During my exposition I have ventured upon many  
-P-A-G-E-14
xvi FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
criticisms of masters in the various departments of 
knowledge into which I have penetrated; but in all 
cases with great respect. Criticism, such as I have 
indulged in, is nothing more than a respectful difference 
of opinion on the particular points under discussion, 
and which need every light which can be thrown upon 
them, even by the humblest student. 
I am particularly obliged to Mr. Lang, Mr. Hartland, 
Dr. Haddon, and Dr. Rivers, for kindly reading my 
chapter on Anthropological Conditions, and for much 
valuable and kind help therein ; and especially I owe 
Mr. Lang most grateful thanks, for he took an immense 
deal of trouble and gave me the advantage of his 
searching criticism, always in the direction of an en- 
deavour to perfect my faulty evidence. I shall not 
readily part with his letters and MS. on this subject, 
for they show alike his generosity and his brilliance. 
To my old friend Mr. Fairman Ordish I am once 
more indebted for help in reading my sheets, and I am 
also glad to acknowledge the fact that two of my sons, 
Allan Gomme and Wycombe Gomme, have read my 
proofs and helped me much, not only by their criticism, 
but by their knowledge.

  FOLKLORE 
AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
CHAPTER I 
HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 
T may be stated as a general rule that history and 
folklore are not considered as complementary 
studies. Historians deny the validity of folklore 
as evidence of history, and folklorists ignore the essence 
of history which exists in folklore. Of late years it is 
true that Dr. Frazer, Prof. Ridgeway, Mr. Warde 
Fowler, Miss Harrison, Mr. Lang, and others have 
broken through this antagonism and shown that the 
two studies stand together; but this is only in certain 
special directions, and no movement is apparent that 
the brilliant results of special inquiries are to bring 
about a general consideration of the mutual help which 
the two studies afford, if in their respective spheres the 
evidence is treated with caution and knowledge, and if 
the evidence from each is brought to bear upon the 
necessities of each. 
The necessities of history are obvious. There are con- 
siderable gaps in historical knowledge, and the further 
B

  2 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
back we desire to penetrate the scantier must be the 
material at the historian’s disposal. In any case there 
can be only two considerable sources of historical know- 
ledge, namely, foreign and native. Looking at the sub- 
ject from the points presented by the early history of 
our own country, there are the Greek and Latin writers 
to whom Britain was a source of interest as the most 
distant part of the then known world, and the native 
historians, who, witnessing the terribly changing events 
which followed the break-up of the Roman dominion 
over Britain, recorded their views of the changes and 
their causes, and in course of time recorded also some of 
the events of Celtic history and of Anglo-Saxon history. 
Then for later periods, no country of the Western 
world possesses such magnificent materials for history 
as our own. In the vast quantity of public and private 
documents which are gradually being made accessible 
to the student there exists material for the illustration 
and elucidation of almost every side and every period 
of national life, and no branch of historical research is 
more fruitful of results than the comparison of the 
records of the professed historian with the documents 
which have not come from the historian’s hands. 
All this, however, does not give us the complete 
story. Necessarily there are great and important gaps. 
Contemporary writers make themselves the judges of 
what is important to record; documents preserved in 
public or private archives relate only to such events as 
need or command the written record or instrument, or 
to those which have interested some of the actors and 
their families. Hence in both departments of history, 
the historical narrative and the original record, it will
-P-A-G-E-17
  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 3 
be found on careful examination that much is needed to 
make the picture of life complete. It is the detail of 
every-day thought and action that is missing—all that 
is so well known, the obvious as it passes before every 
chronicler, the ceremony, the faith, and the action 
which do not apparently affect the movements of civilis- 
ation, but which make up the personal, religious and 
political life of the people. It is always well to bear in 
mind that the historical records preserved from the past 
must necessarily be incomplete. An accident preserves 
one, and an accident destroys another. An incident 
strikes one historian, and is of no interest to another. 
And it may well be that the lost document, the un- 
recorded incident, is of far more value to later ages 
than what has been preserved. This condition of his- 
torical research is always present to the scientific 
student, though it is not always brought to bear upon 
the results of historical scholarship.1_ But the scope of 
the historian is gradually but surely widening. It is 
no longer possible to shut the door to geography, 
ethnography, economics, sociology, archeology, and 
the attendant studies if the historian desires to work his 
subject out to the full.? It is even getting to be 
admitted that an appeal must be made to folklore, 
though the extent and the method are not understood. 
After all that can be obtained from other realms of 
knowledge, it is seen that there is a large gap left still 
—a gap in the heart of things, a gap waiting to be 
1 Mr. Kemble gives an important illustration of this proposition in his 
Saxons in England, i. 331. 
2 I would refer the reader to Prof. York Powell's brilliant lecture on 
“A Survey of Modern History,” printed in his biography by Mr. Oliver 
Elton, ii. 1-13, for an admirable summary of this view. 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
    4 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
filled by all that can be learned about the thought, 
ideas, beliefs, conceptions, and aspirations of the 
people which have been translated for them, but not 
by them, in the laws, institutions, and religion which 
find their way so easily into history. 
The necessities of folklore are far greater than and 
of a different kind from those of history. Edmund 
Spenser wrote three centuries ago ‘‘by these old 
customs the descent of nations can only be proved 
where other monuments of writings are not remayn- 
ing,”1 and yet the descent of nations is still being 
proved without the aid of folklore. It is certain that 
the appeal will not be made to its fullest extent unless 
the folklorist makes it clear that it will be answered in 
a fashion which commands attention. It appears to 
me that the preliminary conditions for such an appeal 
must be ascertained from the folklore side. History 
has not only justified its existence, but during the long 
period of years during which it has been a specific 
branch of learning it has shown its capacity for proceed- 
ing on strictly scientific and ever-widening lines. Folk- 
lore has neither had a long period for its study nor a 
completely satisfactory record of scientific work. It is, 
therefore, essential that folklore should establish its 
right to a place among the historical sciences. At 
present that right is not admitted. It is objected to by 
scholars who will not admit that history can proceed 
from anything but a dated and certified document, and 
by a few who do not admit that history has anything 
to do with affairs that do not emanate from the pro- 
1 View of the State of Ireland, 1595, p. 478.
-P-A-G-E-19
  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 5 
minent political or military personages of each period. 
It is silently, if not contemptuously ignored by almost 
every historical inquirer whose attention has not been 
specially directed to the evidence contained in tradi- 
tional material. Thus between the difficulties arising 
from the interpretation of texts which, originating in 
oral tradition, have by reason of their early record 
become literature, and the difficulties arising from the 
objections of historians to accept any evidence that is 
not strictly historical in the form they assume to be 
historical, traditional material has not been extensively 
used as history. It has also been wrongly defined by 
historians. Thus, to give a pertinent example, so good 
a scholar as Mr. W. H. Stevenson, in his admirable 
edition of Asser’s Life of King Alfred, lays to the 
crimes of tradition an error which is due to other 
causes. Indeed, he states the cause of the error 
correctly, but does not see that he is contradicting 
himself in so doing. It is worth quoting this case. 
It has to do with the identification of ‘‘ Cynuit,” a place 
where the Danes obtained a victory over the English 
forces, and Kenwith Castle in Devonshire has been 
claimed as the site of the struggle and ‘‘a place known 
as Bloody Corner in Northam is traditionally regarded 
as the scene of a duel between two of the chieftains in 
877, and a monument recording the battle has been 
erected.”! Mr. Stevenson’s comment upon this is: 
‘We have in this an instructive example of the worth- 
lessness of ‘tradition’ which is here, as so frequently 
happens elsewhere, the outcome of the dreams of 
1 Asser's Life of Alfred, by W. H. Stevenson, 262.
-P-A-G-E-20
  6 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
local antiquaries, whose identifications become gradu- 
ally impressed upon the memory of the inhabitants” ; 
and he then proceeds to show that this particular tradi- 
tion was produced by the suggestion of Mr. R. S. 
Vidal in 1804. Of course, the answer of the folklorist 
to this charge against the value of tradition is that the 
example is not a case of tradition’ at all. On the con- 
trary, it is a case of false history, started by the local 
antiquary, adopted by the scholars of the day, per- 
petuated by the government in its ordnance survey of 
the district, and kept alive in the minds of the people 
not by tradition but by a duly certified monument 
erected for the express purpose of commemorating the 
invented incident. There is then no tradition in any 
one of the stages through which the episode has 
passed. It is all history and false history. Historians 
cannot shake off their responsibilities by looking upon 
the local antiquary as the responsible author of tradition. 
They cannot but admit that the local antiquary belongs 
to the historical school, even though he is not a fully 
equipped member of his craft, and because he blunders 
they must not class him as a folklorist. They must bring 
better evidence than this to show the worthlessness of 
tradition. In the meantime it is the constant definition 
of tradition as worthless, the relegation of worthless 
history ‘‘to the realms of folklore,”* which does so 
1 It is not worth while unduly emphasising this point, but the peculiar 
habit of classing fictional literature as folklore and thereupon condemn- 
ing the value of tradition is very prevalent. Mr. Nutt, in dealing with 
the Troy stories in British history, adopts this method, and denies 
the existence of historic tradition on the strength of it, Folklore, xii. 
336-9. ® This expression was recently allowed in our old friend Notes and 
Queries in a singularly unsuitable case, 1oth ser, vii. 344.
-P-A-G-E-21
  
HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 4 
much harm to the study of folklore as a science.’ 
Because the historian misnames an historical error as 
tradition, or fails to discover, at the moment he 
requires it, the fact which lies hidden in tradition, he 
must not dismiss the whole realm of tradition as use- 
less for historical purposes. 
Let us freely admit that the historian is not altogether 
to blame for his neglect and for his ignorance of tradi- 
tion as historical material. He has nothing very de- 
finite to work upon. Even the great work of Grimm is 
open to the criticism that it does not rove the antiquity 
of popular custom and belief—it merely states the 
proposition, and then relies for proof upon the accumu- 
lation of an enormous number of examples and the 
almost entire impossibility of suggesting any other 
origin than that of antiquity for such a mass of non- 
Christian material. Then the great work of Grimm, 
ethnographical in its methods, has never been followed 
up by similar work for other countries. The philosophy 
of folklore has taken up almost all the time of our 
scholars and students, and the contribution it makes to 
the history of the civilised races has not been made out 
by folklorists themselves. It does not appear to me 
to be difficult to make out such a claim if only scientific 
methods are adopted, and the solution of definite prob- 
1 I am not sure this is always the fault of those who are not folklorists, 
I recently came across a dictum of one of the most distinguished folk- 
lorists, Mr. Andrew Lang, which is certainly much in the same direction. 
‘‘As a rule tradition is the noxious ivy that creeps about historical truth, 
and needs to be stripped off with a ruthless hand. Tradition is a collec- 
tion of venerable and romantic blunders. But a tradition which clings 
to a permanent object in the landscape, a tall stone, a grassy, artificial 
tumulus, or even an old tree, may be unexpectedly correct.”—Morning

lems is attempted ;! and if too the difficulties in the 
way of proof are freely admitted, and where they 
become insuperable, the attempt at proof is frankly 
abandoned. I believe that every single item of folklore, 
every folk-tale, every tradition, every custom and super- 
stition, has its origin in some definite fact in the 
history of man; but I am ready to concede that the 
definite fact is not always traceable, that it sometimes 
goes so far back as to defy recognition, that it some- 
times relates to events which have no place in the 
after-history of peoples who have taken a position 
on the earth’s surface, and which, in the pre-history 
stage, belong to humanity rather than to peoples. 
Folklore, too, is governed by its own laws and rules 
which are not the laws and rules of history. These 
concessions, however, do not mean the introduction 
of the term ‘‘impossible” to our studies. They 
mean rather a plea for the steady and systematic. 
study of our material, on the ground that it has 
much to yield to the historian of man, and to 
the historians of races, of peoples, of nations, and of 
countries. 
We cannot, however, show that this is so with- 
out facing many difficulties created for the most 
part by folklorists themselves. In the first place 
it is necessary to overtake some of the earlier con- 
clusions of the great masters of our science. The 
first rush, after the discovery of the mine, led to

International Folklore Congress on the historical aspect of Folklore ;

his all too short address as President of the Folklore Society, see 
Folklore, xv. 12-23.

the vortex created by the school of comparative myth- 
ologists, who limited their comparison to the myths 
of Aryan-speaking people, who absolutely ignored the 
evidence of custom, rite, and belief, and who could see 
nothing beyond interpretations of the sun, dawn, 
and sky gods in the parallel stories they were the 
first to discover and value. We need not ignore all 
this work, nor need we be ungrateful to the pioneers 
who executed it. It was necessary that their view 
should be stated, and it is satisfactory that it was 
stated at a time early in the existence of our science, 
because it is possible to clear it all away, or as much of 
it as is necessary, without undue interference with the 
material of which it is composed. 
The school of comparative mythologists did not, 
however, entirely control the early progress of the 
study of folklore. There was always a school who 
believed in the foundation of myth being derived from 
the facts of life. Thus Dr. Tylor, in a remarkable 
study of historical traditions and myths of observation, 
long ago noted that many of the traditions current 
among mankind were historical in origin. Writing 
nearly forty years ago, he had to submit to the in- 
fluence, then at its height, of Adalbert Kuhn and Max 
Miiller, and he conceded that there’ were many tradi- 
tions which were fictional myths. I think this conces- 
sion must now be much more narrowly scrutinised, and 
preparation made for the conclusion that every genuine 
myth is a myth of observation, the observation by men 
in a primitive state of culture, of a fact which had 
struck home to their minds. The question is, to what

10 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
part of human history does the central fact appertain? 
Here is undoubtedly a most difficult problem. What 
the student has to do is to admit the difficulty, and to 
state, if necessary, that the fact preserved by tradition 
is not in all cases possible to discover with our present 
knowledge. This is a perfectly tenable position. 
(¢ Human imagination cannot invent anything that is 
outside of fact. It may, and of course too frequently 
does, misinterpret facts. In attempting to explain and 
account for such facts with insufficient knowledge, it 
gets far away from the truth, but this misinterpretation 
of fact must not be confused with the fact itself. In a 
word, it must be borne in mind by the student of tradi- 
tion that every tradition which has assumed the form 
of saga, myth, or story contains two perfectly indepen- 
dent elements—the fact upon which it is founded, and 
the interpretation of the fact which its founders have 
attempted. 
There is further than this. The other branch of 
traditional material, namely that relating to custom, 
belief, and rite, rests upon a solid basis of historic fact ; 
customs which are strange and irrational to this age are 
not in consequence to be considered the mere worthless 
following of practices which owe their origin to accident 
or freak; beliefs which do not belong to the established 
religion are not in consequence to be considered as 
mere superstition; rites which were not established 
by authority are not in consequence to be classed as 
mere specimens of popular ignorance. But the diffi- 
culties in the way of getting all this accepted by the 
historian are many, and, again, not a few of them are the 
creation of the folklorist himself. Not only has he 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  
HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 11 
neglected to classify and arrange the scattered items of 
custom, belief, and rite, and to ascertain the degree of 
association which the scattered items have with each 
other, but he has set about the far more difficult and 
complex task of comparative study without having 
previously prepared his material. 
The historian and the folklorist are thus brought 
face to face with what is expected from both, in order 
that each may work alongside of the other, using each 
other’s materials and conclusions at the right moment 
and in the right places. The folklorist has the most to 
do to get his results ready, and to explain and secure 
his position. He has been wandering about in a 
somewhat inconsequential fashion, bent upon finding 
a mythos where he should have sought for a persona 
or a Jocus, engaged in an extensive quest after parallels 
when he should have been preparing his own material 
for the process of comparative science, seeking for 
origins amidst human error when he should have 
turned to human experience. He has to change all 
this waywardness for systematic study, and this will 
lead him in the first place to disengage from the results 
hitherto obtained those which may be accepted and 
which may form the starting-point for future work. 
But his greatest task will be the reconsideration of 
former results and the rewriting of much that has 
been written on the wrong lines, and when this is 
done we shall have the historian and folklorist meet- 
ing together in the spirit which Edmund Spenser 
so finely and truly described three centuries ago in 
his treatment of Irish history: ‘‘I do herein rely 
upon those bards or Irish chronicles . . . but unto  
-P-A-G-E-28
  12 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
them besides I add mine own reading and out of them 
both together with comparison of times likewise of 
manners and customs, affinity of words and manner, 
properties of natures and uses, resemblances of rites 
and ceremonies, monuments of churches and tombs 
and many other like circumstances I do gather a likeli- 
hood of truth, not certainly affirming anything, but by 
conferring of times language monuments and such like 
I do hunt out a probability of things which I leave to 
your judgment to believe or refuse.” 
I shall of course not be able to undertake either 
of these tasks. I shall attempt, however, to indicate 
their scope and importance; and as a preliminary to 
the consideration of the definite departments into which 
the subject falls, it is advisable, I think, to test the 
relationship of tradition to history by means of one 
or two illustrations. It may be that the illustrations I 
shall give are not accepted by all students, that some 
better illustration is forthcoming by further research. 
This is one of the drawbacks from which tradition 
suffers, and must suffer, until our studies are much 
further advanced than they are at present. But I am 
glad to accept this possibility of error as part of the 
case for the study of tradition, because the error of one 
student cannot be held to disqualify the whole subject. 
It only amounts to saying that the particular fact which 
seems to me to be discoverable in the examples dealt 
with has to be surrendered in favour of another par- 
ticular fact. My conclusions may be dismissed, but 
that which is not dismissible is the discoverable fact, 
and it is only when the true fact is discovered in

each traditional item that previous inferences may be 
neglected or ignored and inquiry cease.’ 
I 
The evidence of historic events which enter into 
tradition relates principally to the earliest periods, but 
much of it relates to periods well within the domain 
of history and yet reveals facts which history has either 
hopelessly neglected or misinterpreted. We shall find 
that these facts, though frequently relating to minor 
events, often have reference to matters of the highest 
national importance, and perhaps nowhere more 
definitely is this the case than in the legends con- 
nected with particular localities. Of one such tradi- 
tion I will state what a somewhat detailed examination 
tells in this direction. It will, I think, serve as a 
good example of the kind of research that is required 
in each case, and it will illustrate in a rather special 
manner the value of these traditions to history. 
The locus of the legend centres round London 
Bridge. The earliest written version of this legend is 
quoted from the MSS. of Sir Roger Twysden, who 
obtained it from ‘‘Sir William Dugdale, of Blyth Hall, 
in Warwickshire, in a letter dated 29th January, 
1 Perhaps the most remarkable testimony to the foundation of the 
folk-tale and ballad in the events of history is to be found in a state- 
ment made to the Zribune, 14 September, 1906, by Mr. Mitra, once pro- 
prietor and editor of the Deccan Post, with regard to the agitation 
against the partition of Bengal into two provinces. Mr. Mitra deliber- 
ately states that ‘‘the best test of finding out Hindu feeling towards the 
British Government is to see whether there are any ballads or nursery 
rhymes in the Bengali language against the British. You can have 
it from me, and I challenge contradiction, that there is no single ballad 
or nursery rhyme in the Bengali language which is against the British.” 
This is where the soul of the people speaks out. 
 
-P-A-G-E-30

1652-3.” Sir William says of it that ‘‘it was the 
tradition of the inhabitants as it was told me there,” 
and Sir Roger Twysden adds of it that: ‘‘1 have since 
learnt from others to be most true.” This, therefore, is 
a very respectable origin for the legend, and I will 
transcribe it from Sir William Dugdale’s letter which 
begins ‘‘the story of the Pedlar of Swaffham-market is 
in substance this ” :— 
“That dreaming one night if he went to London he 
should certainly meet with a man on London Bridge which 
would tell him good news he was so perplext in his mind 
that till he set upon his journey he could have no rest; to 
London therefore he hasts and walk’d upon the Bridge for 
some hours where being espyed by a shopkeeper and asked 
what he wanted he answered you may well ask me that ques- 
tion for truly (quoth he) I am come hither upon a very vain 
errand and so told the story of his dream which occasioned 
the journey. Whereupon the shopkeeper reply’d alas good 
friend should I have heeded dreams I might have proved 
myself as very a fool as thou hast, for ’tis not long since that 
I dreamt that ata place called Swaffham Market in Norfolk 
dwells one John Chapman a pedlar who hath a tree in his 
backside under which is buried a pot of money. Now there- 
fore if I should have made a journey thither to day for such 
hidden treasure judge you whether I should not have been 
counted a fool. To whom the pedlar cunningly said yes verily 
I will therefore return home and follow my business not heed- 
ing such dreams hence forward. But when he came home 
being satisfied that his dream was fulfilled he took occasion to 
dig in that place and accordingly found a large pot of money 
which he prudently conceal’d putting the pot amongst the 
rest of his brass. After a time it happen’d that one who 
came to his house and beholding the pot observed an inscrip- 
tion upon it which being in Latin he interpreted it that under 
that there was an other twice as good. Of this inscription the 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 15 
Pedlar was before ignorant or at least minded it not but when 
he heard the meaning of it he said ’tis very true in the shop 
where I bought this pot stood another under it which was 
twice as big; but considering that it might tend to his further 
profit to dig deeper in the same place where he found that he 
fell again to work and discover’d such a pot as was intimated 
by the inscription full of old coins : notwithstanding all which 
he so conceal’d his wealth that the neighbours took no notice 
Of init* 
Blomefield thought it ‘‘somewhat surprising to find 
such considerable persons as Sir William Dugdale 
and Sir Roger Twysden to patronise or credit such a 
monkish legend and tradition savouring so much of 
the cloister, and that the townsmen and neighbourhood 
should also believe it,” but I think we shall have 
reason to congratulate ourselves that so good a folk-tale 
was preserved for us of this age. 
The next and, it appears, an independent version, is 
given in the Diary of Abraham de la Pryme, under the 
date November roth, 1699 :— 
“Constant tradition says that there lived in former times, 
in Soffham (Swaffham), a/zas Sopham, in Norfolk, a certain 
pedlar, who dreamed that if he went to London bridge, and 
stood there, he should hear very joyfull newse, which he at 
first sleighted, but afterwards, his dream being dubled and 
trebled upon him, he resolv’d to try the issue of it, and 
accordingly went to London, and stood on the bridge there 
two or three days, looking about him, but heard nothing 
that might yield him any comfort. At last it happen’d that 
a shopkeeper there, hard by, haveing noted his fruitless 
1 It is printed, and I have used this print, in Blomefield’s History of 
Norfolk (1769), iii. 506, from which source I quote the facts concerning it. 
Sir William Dugdale’s account goes on to connect it with a monument in 
the church, but this part of the local version is to be considered presently. 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
   
   
      16 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
standing, seeing that he neither sold any wares nor asked 
any almes, went to him and most earnestly begged to know 
what he wanted there, or what his business was ; to which 
the pedlar honestly answer’d, that he had dream’d that if he 
came to London and stood there upon the bridg, he should 
hear good newse; at which the shopkeeper laught heartily, 
asking him if he was such a fool as to take a journey on 
such a silly errand, adding, ‘I'll tell thee, country fellow, 
last night I dream’d that I was at Sopham, in Norfolk, a 
place utterly unknown to me, where methought behind a 
pedlar’s house in a certain orchard, and under a great oak 
tree, if I digged I should find a vast treasure! Now think 
you,’ says he, ‘that I am such a fool to take such a long 
jorney upon me upon the instigation of a silly dream? No, 
no, I’m wiser. Therefore, good fellow, learn witt of me, 
and get you home, and mind your business.’ The pedlar, 
observeing his words, what he had sayd he had dream’d and 
knowing they concenterd in him, glad of such joyfull newse 
went speedily home, and digged and found a prodigious 
great treasure, with which he grew exceeding rich, and 
Soffham church being for the most part fal’n down he set 
on workmen and reedifyd it most sumptuously, at his own 
charges ; and to this day there is his statue therein, cut in 
stone, with his pack at his back, and his dogg at his heels ; 
and his memory is also preserved by the same form or 
picture in most of the old glass windows, taverns, and ale- 
houses of that town unto this day.’’! 
Now this version from Abraham de la Pryme was 
certainly obtained from local sources, and it shows the 
general popularity of the legend, together with the 
faithfulness of the traditional version.2 But other     
1 See the Diary printed by the Surtees Society, p. 220. 
® The legend was also printed in that popular folk-book, Mew Help to 
Discourse, so often printed between 1619 and 1656, and Mr. Axon tran- 
scribed this version for the Antiquary, xi. 167-168 ; and see my notes in 
Gent. Mag. Lib. English Traditions, 332-336.

evidence of the traditional force of the story is to be 
found. Observing that De la Pryme’s Diary was not 
printed until 1870, though certainly the MS. had been 
lent to antiquaries, it is curious that the following 
almost identical account is told in the S¢. /ames’s 
Chronicle of November 28th, 1786 :—t 
‘*A Pedlar who lived many Years ago at Swaffham, in 
Norfolk, dreamt, that if he came up to London, and stood 
upon the Bridge, he should hear very joyful News ; which he 
at first slighted, but afterwards his Dream being doubled 
and trebled unto him, he resolved to try the Issue of it; and 
accordingly to London he came, and stood on the Bridge for 
two or three Days, but heard nothing which might give him 
Comfort that the Profits of his Journey would be equal to 
his Pains. At last it so happened, that a Shopkeeper there, 
having noted his fruitless standing, seeing that he neither 
sold any Wares, or asked any Alms, went to him, and 
enquired his Business ; to which the Pedlar made Answer, 
that being a Countryman, he had dreamt a Dream, that if he 
came up to London, he should hear good News: ‘ And art 
thou (said the Shopkeeper) such a Fool, to take a Journey 
on such a foolish Errand? Why I tell thee this—last Night 
I dreamt, that I was at Swaffham, in Norfolk, a Place 
utterly unknown to me, where, methought, behind a Pedlar’s 
House, in a certain Orchard, under a great Oak Tree, if I 
digged there, I should find a mighty Mass of Treasure. 
Now think you, that I am so unwise, as to take so long a 
Journey upon me, only by the Instigation of a foolish Dream! 
No, no, far be such Folly from me; therefore, honest 
Countryman, I advise thee to make haste Home again, and 
do not spend thy precious Time in the Expectation of the 
Event of an idle Dream.’ The Pedlar, who noted well his 
Words, glad of such joyful News, went speedily Home, and 
1 I happen to possess the original cutting of this version preserved 
among my great-grandfather’s papers. 
c

                  18 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
digged under the Oak, where he found a very large Heap of 
Money; with Part of which, the Church being then lately 
fallen down, he very sumptuously rebuilt it; having his 
Statue cut therein, in Stone, with his Pack on his Back and 
his Dog at his Heels, which is to be seen at this Day. And 
his Memory is also preserved by the same Form, or Picture, 
on most of the Glass Windows of the Taverns and Ale- 
houses in that Town.” 
The differences in these versions are sufficient to 
show independent origin. The identities are sufficient 
to illustrate, in a rather remarkable manner, how closely 
the words of the tradition were always followed. It 
appears from the last words of the contributor to the 
St. James's Chronicle, who signed himself ‘‘Z,” that 
he heard it by word of mouth about the time of his 
writing it down,! so that there is more than a hundred 
years between him and the Dugdale version, which was 
also recorded from ‘‘ constant tradition.” 
In Glyde’s Norfolk Garland (p. 69), is an account of 
this legend, but with a variant of one incident. The 
box containing the treasure had a Latin inscription on 
the lid, which John Chapman could not decipher. He 
put the lid in his window, and very soon he heard 
some youths turn the Latin sentence into English :— 
      
          
       “Under me doth lie 
Another much richer than I.”    
    And he went to work digging deeper than before, 
and found a much richer treasure than the former. 
Another version of this rhyme is found in Zransactions           
     1 These words are, ‘I am not a Bigot in Dreams, yet I cannot help 
acknowledging the Relation of the above made a strong Impression 
on me.”     
-P-A-G-E-35
  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 19 
of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society (iii. 318) as 
follows :— “ Where this stood 
Is another as good.” 
And both these versions are given by Blomefield. 
Now if there were no other places besides Swaffham in 
Norfolk to which this legend is applied the interest in it 
would, of course, not be very great, But there are many 
other places, and we will first note those in Britain. 
The best is from Upsall, in Yorkshire, as follows :— 
‘Many years ago there resided, in the village of Upsall, 
a man who dreamed three nights successively that if he went 
to London Bridge he would hear of something greatly to his 
advantage. He went, travelling the whole distance from 
Upsall to London on foot ; arrived there, he took his station 
on the bridge, where he waited until his patience was nearly 
exhausted, and the idea that he had acted a very foolish part 
began to rise in his mind. At length he was accosted by a 
Quaker, who kindly inquired what he was waiting there so 
long for? After some hesitation, he told his dreams. The 
Quaker laughed at his simplicity, and told him that he had 
had last night a very curious dream himself, which was, that 
if he went and dug under a certain bush in Upsall Castle, in 
Yorkshire, he would find a pot of gold; but he did not know 
where Upsall was, and inquired of the countryman if he knew, 
who, seeing some advantage in secrecy, pleaded ignorance 
of the locality, and then, thinking his business in London 
was completed, returned immediately home, dug beneath the 
bush, and there he found a pot filled with gold, and on the 
cover an inscription in a language which he did not under- 
stand. The pot and cover were, however, preserved at the 
village inn, where one day a bearded stranger like a Jew, 
made his appearance, saw the pot, and read the inscription on 
the cover, the plain English of which was— 
“© Look lower, where this stood 
Is another twice as good.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
20 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
The man of Upsall hearing this resumed his spade, returned 
to the bush, dug deeper, and found another pot filled with 
gold, far more valuable than the first. Encouraged by this 
discovery, he dug deeper still, and found another yet more 
valuable. 
‘This is the constant tradition of the neighbourhood, and 
the identical bush yet exists (or did in 1860) beneath which 
the treasure was found ; a burtree, or elder, Sambucus nigra, 
near the north-west corner of the ruins of the old castle.” 1 
It would be tedious to go through other English 
versions,? but I must point out that it is connected 
with a London district. This is shown not by the 
actual presence of the legend, which has died out in 
London, but by its representation in the parish church 
of Lambeth. The legend so strongly current at Swaff- 
ham, in Norfolk, is represented in the church in the 
shape of a carving in wood of a figure to represent the 
pedlar, and below him the figure of what is locally 
called a dog. A comparison of this carving with the 
representation of the pedlar’s window formerly existing 
in Lambeth Church, but which was sacrilegiously re- 
moved in 1884 by the late vicar of the parish, shows much 
the same general characteristics, and search among the 
1 Leeds Mercury, January 3rd, 1885, communicated by Mr. Wm. 
Grainge of Harrogate. 
2 Mr. Axon says it is current in Lancashire and in Cornwall, Anti- 
quary, xi. 168; Sir John Rhys gives two Welsh versions in his Celtic 
Folklore, ii. 458-462, 464-466 ; a Yorkshire version in ballad form is to 
be found in Castillo’s Poems in the North Yorkshire Dialect (1878), under 
the title of “‘T’ Lealholm Chap's lucky dreeam,” Antiquary, xii. 1213 
an Ayrshire variant relates to the building of Dundonald Castle, and is 
given in Chambers’s Pop. Rhymes of Scotland, 236. 
% Blomefield, Hist. of Norfolk, iii. 507, suggests that the animal 
carving represents a bear, There is nothing to confirm this and readers 
may judge for themselves by reference to the illustrations, which are 
from photographs taken in Swaffham Church.

  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 21 
parish books shows it to relate to a pedlar known by the 
name of Dog Smith, who left property still known by the 
name of the ‘‘ Pedlar’s Acre” to the parish.’ All this 
suggests that we have here the last relics of the pedlar 
legend located in London. 
The next stage in the history of this legend shows it 
to belong to the world’s collection of folk-tales. There 
is, however, a preliminary fact of great significance to 
note, namely that two non-British versions refer to 
London Bridge. Thus a Breton tale refers to London 
Bridge, and the interest of this story is sufficiently 
great to quote it here from its recorder straight from 
the Breton folk :— 
“Long ago, when the timbers of the most ancient of the 
vessels of Brest were not yet acorns, there were two men in 
a farmhouse in the Cétes du Nord disputing, and they were 
disputing about London Bridge. One said it was the most 
beautiful sight in the world, while the other very truly said, 
“No! the grace of the good God was more beautiful still.’ 
And as the dispute went on, ‘Let us,’ said one of them, 
“settle it once and for all, and in this way: let us now this 
moment go out along the high-road and let us ask the first 
three men we meet as to which is the most beautiful—London 
Bridge or the grace of the good God? And which ever way 
they decide, he who holds the beaten opinion shall lose to 
the other all his possessions, farm and cattle and horses, 
everything.’ So each being confident he was right, they 
went out: and the first man they met declared that though 
the grace of the good God was beautiful, London Bridge was 
more beautiful still; and the second the same, and the third. 
And the man whose opinion was beaten, a rich farmer, gave 
up all he had and was a beggar. 
‘© * Now,’ said he to himself when the other, taking his

horse by the bridle, had left him—‘now let me go and see this 
London Bridge which is so wonderfully beautiful ;’ and, 
being very manful and stout, he set out at once to walk, and 
walking on and on was there by nightfall. But, good 
Christian that he was, he could see in it nothing to shake his 
belief that the grace of the good God was more beautiful 
still. 
** Soon the bridge was silent, and the last to cross it had 
gone home; and he, notwithstanding his losses, tired out 
and sleepy, lay down and fell into a doze there ; and, while 
he was dozing, there came by two men, and one of them, stand- 
ing quite close by him, said to the other, ‘ The night is fine, 
the wind gentle, the stars clear! On such a night whoever 
were to collect the dew would be able to heal the blind.’ 
‘It is true,’ answered the other ; ‘ but none know of it.’ And 
they passed on, quietly as they had come. Thereupon up 
rose the beggared farmer, and with basin and cup set about 
collecting the dew ; and in a very short time performed with 
it the most wonderful cures ; finally curing the daughter of a 
neighbouring Emperor who had been blind from her birth, 
and whom her grateful father gave to him at once in 
marriage, since directly she set eyes on him she loved 
him.”? 
The second non-British variant, which also attaches 
to London Bridge, is to be found in the Hecmskringla,” 
and I will quote William Morris’s translation :— 
‘“‘ West in Valland was a man infirm so that he was a 
cripple and went on knees and knuckles. Ona day he was 
abroad on the way and was asleep there. That dreamed he 
that a man came to him glorious of aspect and asked 
whither he was bound and the man named some town or

other. So the glorious man spoke to him: Fare then to 
Olaf’s church the one that is in London and thou wilt be whole. 
Thereafter he awoke, and fared to seek Olaf’s church and at 
last he came to London bridge and there asked the folk of 
the city if they knew to tell him where was Olaf’s church. 
But they answered and said that there were many more 
churches there than they might wot to what man they were 
hallowed. But a little thereafter came a man to him who 
asked whither he was bound and the cripple told him. And 
sithence said that man: We twain shall fare both to the 
church of Olaf for I know the way thither. Therewith they 
fared over the bridge and went along the street which led to 
Olaf’s church. But when they came to the lich gate then 
strode that one over the threshold of the gate but the cripple 
rolled in over it and straightway rose up a whole man. 
But when he looked around him his fellow farer was 
vanished.” 
I shall have to refer again to these Breton and Norse 
versions, because of their retention of London Bridge 
as the locale of the story, in common with all the ver- 
sions which have been found in Britain. In the mean- 
time it is to be noted that the remaining non-British 
variants are told of other bridges and other places. 
Holland, Denmark, Italy, Cairo, have their representa- 
tive variants ;! and it thus presents to the student of

ing and research, by Mr. Hartland in the Antiquary, xv. 45-48. Blome- 
field, in his History of Norfolk, iii. 507, points out that the same story is 
found in Johannes Fungerus’ Ztymologicon Latino-Grecum, pp. 1110- 
1111, though it is here narrated of a man at Dort in Holland, and in 
Histoires admirables de nostre temps, par Simon Goulart, Geneva, 1614,

tiquarian Society Transactions, p. 320, has printed a remarkable parallel 
of the story which is to be found in the great Persian metaphysical and 
religious poem called the Masnavi, written by Jaldluddin, who died 
about 1260. J. Grimm discussed these treasure-on-the-bridge stories in 
Kleinere Schriften, iii. 414-428, and did not attach much value to them.

tradition an excellent example for inquiry as to the 
value to history of legends world-wide in their distribu- 
tion attaching themselves to historical localities. 
There are some obvious features about this group of 
traditions, which at once lead to interesting questions. 
There is first the fact that all the British variants of the 
treasure stories centre round London Bridge; secondly, 
there is the extension beyond Britain to the Breton 
variant and the Norse variant, both non-British 
legends, of which the Jocus is London Bridge. From 
these two facts it is clear that London Bridge had 
some special influence at a period of its history which 
dates before the separation of the Breton folk from 
their Celtic brethren in Britain, for the Bretons would 
not after their separation acquire a London Bridge 
tradition ; and again at a period of its history when 
Norse legend and saga were fashioning. In the one 
case the myth-makers must have been Celts of the 
fourth century, and the only bridge known to these 
Celts must have been that belonging to Roman Lun- 
dinium; in the other case the myth-makers were 
Norsemen, and the bridge known to them was the 
later bridge so frequently referred to in the chronicle 
accounts of the Danish and Norse invasions of 
England. 
It is not difficult, by a joint appeal to history 
and folklore, to trace out from this very definite 
starting-point the events which brought about this 
particular specialisation of the world-spread treasure 
myths. 
Obviously the first point to note is that London 
Bridge loomed out greatly in the minds and under-
-P-A-G-E-45
  
HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 25 
standing of people at two distinct periods of its history." 
That the first period relates to its building is suggested 
by the date supplied by the evidence of the Breton 
version. The people who wondered at its building, 
or the results of its building, were certainly not the 
builders themselves, and we thus see a distinction in 
culture between the bridge builders and the wonder 
builders. This condition is exactly provided for by 
the building of the earliest London Bridge. It was a 
work of the Romans of Lundinium,” and the people 
who stood in wonder at this great enterprise were not 
the Roman engineers and builders, accustomed to such 
undertakings all over the then known world, and they 
must therefore have been the surrounding non-Roman 
people, who were the Celtic tribesmen. Now the culture- 
antagonism between the Romans of Lundinium and 
the Celts of Britain is, I believe, a factor of great im- 
portance,’ though almost universally neglected by our 
historians, because they do not study the facts of early 
history on anthropological lines. Not only is it dis- 
coverable, as I think, from the facts of history, but the 
facts of tradition confirm the facts of history at all 
points. Thus I think it is important, if we can, to 
obtain independent testimony of the attitude of the 
surrounding people to the builders of London Bridge. 
We can do this by reference to the peasant beliefs 
1 It is not unimportant in this connection to find that London itself 
assumes an exceptional place in tradition. Mr. Frazer notes a German 
legend about London, Golden Bough (2nd ed.), iii. 235; Pausanias, v. 292. 
Mr. Dale has drawn attention to the Anglo-Saxon attitude towards 
Roman buildings in his National Life in Early English Literature, 35.

concerning bridges, as, for instance, in Ireland, where 
on passing over a bridge they invariably pulled off 
their hats and prayed for the soul of the builder of the 
bridge,! and to the fact that the Romans themselves 
looked upon bridge-building as a sacred function, and 
would no doubt use this part of their work to the 
fullest extent, in order to impress the barbarism opposed 
to them.? The extent of this impression may prob- 
ably be contained in the old and widely spread nursery 
rhyme of ‘‘London Bridge is Broken Down,” an 
examination of which has led Mrs. Gomme to conclude 
that it contains reference to an ancient belief that the 
building of the bridge was accompanied by human 
sacrifice. This conclusion is confirmed by the pre- 
servation in Wales of a bridge-sacrifice tradition. It 
relates to the ‘‘Devil’s Bridge” near Beddgelert. 
“‘Many of the ignorant people of the neighbourhood 
believe that this structure was formed by supernatural 
agency. The devil proposed to the neighbouring in- 
habitants that he would build them a bridge across the 
pass, on condition that he should have the first who 
went over it for his trouble. The bargain was made, 
and the bridge appeared in its place, but the people 
cheated the devil by dragging a dog to the spot and 
whipping him over the bridge.”4 This is a distinct 
trace of a substituted animal sacrifice for an original 
human sacrifice. But this is a practice which sends 
us back to the most primitive times, and in par-

ticular we are referred to an exact parallel in India, 
where, on the governing English determining to build 
a bridge of engineering proportions and strength 
over the Hoogley River at Calcutta, the native Hindu 
tribesmen immediately believed that the first require- 
ment would be a human sacrifice for the foundation.? 
The traditions attaching to London Bridge are there- 
fore identical with the current beliefs concerning the 
Hoogley Bridge, and the culture-relationship of the 
bridge-builders to the surrounding people in both cases 
is that of an advanced civilisation to tribesmen. Now 
if these conditions of modern India are repetitions 
of the conditions of ancient Britain in the days of 
Lundinium, and of this there can be but little doubt, 
there is no difficulty in understanding to what part of 
history these traditions have led us. We are again in 
the days when London Bridge was a marvel—a marvel 
which sent travelling through the Celtic homes of 
Britain a new application of the treasure myth which they 
had inherited from remote ancestors. The marvel lived 
on through the ages when London was in the unique 
position of being an undestroyed city in Saxon times, 
1 See my Folklore Relics of Early Village Life, 29; Tylor, Primitive 
Culture, i. 97. This case was reported in the newspapers at the time of 
its occurrence. It came to England from the London and China Tele- 
graph, from which the Newcastle Chronicle, 9 February, 1889, copied 
the following statement :— 
“The boatmen on the Ganges, near Rajmenal, somehow came to 
believe that the Government required a hundred thousand human heads 
as the foundation for a great bridge, and that the Government officers 
were going about the river in search of heads. A hunting party, con- 
sisting of four Europeans, happening to pass in a boat, were set upon 
by the one hundred and twenty boatmen, with the cry ‘Gulla Katta,’ 
or cut-throats, and only escaped with their lives after the greatest 
difficulty.”
-P-A-G-E-48
  28 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
times which witnessed the destruction of all other cities 
of Roman foundation,! and the sending forth of the 
Celtic refugees to Brittany.2. The accumulation during 
along-continuing period of conceptions of treasure being 
found by way of the bridge leading to London, would 
become the direct force for keeping the tradition alive ; 
and while the facts of history show us the important 
position of London during the period which witnessed 
the departure of the Celtic Bretons to their continental 
home,’ the facts of tradition show us the Celtic tribes- 
men deeming it a way to wealth through the magic 
potency of dreamland. The Celtic tribesmen stood 
outside Roman Lundinium. Its life was not their life, 
and their conversion of its position into a mythic 
treasure house or a mythic road to treasure, and their 
association of it with the bloody rites of the foundation 
sacrifice, are in strict accord with the historical relation- 
ship of the tribal life of Celtic Britain to the city life of 
Roman Lundinium. 
I may be permitted perhaps to emphasise this signi- 
ficant accordance of history and tradition when working 
together. I have already alluded to the fact that I 
have worked out the history of London independently, 
and upon lines quite different from the present study. 
1 I have worked out this fact in my Governance of London, 46-68, 
202-229. 
2 See Turner, Hist. of Anglo-Saxons, ii. 207-222; Y Cymmrodor, 
ns a any in William of Malmesbury points to the fact of the Bretons 
in the time of Athelstan looking upon themselves as exiles from the land 
of their fathers. Radhod, a prefect of the church at Avranches, writes 
to King Athelstan as ‘‘ Rex gloriose exultator ecclesiz . . . deprecamur 
atque humiliter invocamus qui in exulatu et captivitate nostris meritis 
et peccatis, in Francia commoramur” etc., De Gestis Regum Anglorum 
(Rolls Ed.), i. 154.

   HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 29 
I have therefore a wider grasp of the two currents of 
history and folklore in this particular case than could 
in the ordinary way fall either to the historian or to the 
folklorist. That I can find in both just the comple- 
mentary facts which help to realise the whole situation, 
to fill in the gaps of history which nowhere directly 
tells of the relationship of Roman Lundinium to the 
British Celts, to extend the outlook of folklore which 
nowhere recognises that there was a great Roman city 
of Lundinium which would dominate the minds of 
those not trained to city life, is a fortunate circumstance 
which neither historian nor folklorist is likely to repeat 
frequently, and I am entitled, I think, to claim the 
utmost from it. I can at least claim that it answers all 
the facts in a way that has not yet been accomplished. 
Thus Sir John Rhys has discussed the treasure legend 
and he can only account for it as part of the mythical 
trappings of Arthur into which ‘‘ London Bridge is 
introduced,” because London Bridge ‘‘formerly loomed 
very large in the popular imagination as one of the 
chief wonders of London.” Sir John Rhys refers for 
confirmation of this to the ‘‘notion cherished as to 
London and London Bridge by the country people of 
Wales even within my own memory,” and then goes on 
to say that ‘‘the fashion of selecting London Bridge as 
the opening scene of a treasure legend had been set 
perhaps by a widely spread English story,” that of the 
Pedlar of Swaffham.! All this is very unsatisfactory. 
Modern notions of this sort would not set the fashion

indebtedness to me for lending him my Swaffham notes, but at that time 
I had not formed the views stated above and Sir John Rhys confessed

two centuries ago, nor extend it to Brittany. Nor is 
the suggestion in accord with other evidence as to the 
extension of tradition. What has happened is that the 
Arthur cycle has appropriated two London Bridge 
traditions and has worked them up into the Arthur 
form, the traditions themselves belonging to the far 
older period to which I have here referred them—a 
period when the burial of treasure was a necessary 
. corollary to the events which were happening.! Buried 
treasure legends are found all over the country. They 
belong to the period of conquest and fighting. They 
are the evidence which tradition yields of the unrest of 
the times which caused them to arise. They are the 
fragments of history which tradition has preserved, 
while history has coldly passed them by.? 
1In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, anno 418, and in Z£thelward’s 
Chronicle, A.D. 418, it is recorded that ‘those of the Roman race who 
were left in Britain bury their treasures in pits, thinking that hereafter 
they might have better fortune, which never was the case.” 
? Buried treasure legends are worth examining carefully, especially 
with reference to their geographical distribution, with a view of ascer- 
taining how far they follow the direction of the Roman, English, Danish 
and Norman Conquests, See Henderson, Folklore of Northern Counties, 
320, for Yorkshire examples, and Folklore Record, i. 16, for an interesting 
Sussex example. 
The Danish part of Lincoln, near Sleaford, has numerous treasure 
legends, see Rev. G. Oliver, Existing Remains of Ancient Britons between 
Lincoln and Sleaford, pp. 29 et seg. 
Mr. W. J. Andrew has proved in the British Numismatic Journal 
(1st ser. i. 9-59) that traditions of buried treasure may be verified a 
thousand years after the laying down of the hoard, This has reference 
to the famous Cuerdale find of coins. The people of Walton-le-Dale, on 
the Ribble, had a legend that if you stood on a certain headland and 
looked up the valley to Ribchester ‘‘ you would gaze over the greatest 
treasure that England had ever seen.” The farmers tried excavations, 
and the divining rod is said to have been used. 
The tradition was true. In May, 1840, the hoard was accidentally 
found, near Cuerdale Hall, within forty yards of the stream, by men

who were repairing the southern bank. A willow tree, still in its prime, 
was planted to mark the spot. We do not know how much bullion was 
scattered by the finders, but there was recovered a mass of ingots, 
armlets, chains, rings, and so on, amounting to 1000 oz., with over 
7ooo silver coins, They lay in a crumbling leaden case, within a 
decomposed chest of wood. There were about 1060 English silver 
coins, whereof 919 were of the reign of King Alfred. There were 
2020 from Northumbrian ecclesiastical mints, and 2534 of King Canute, 
with 1047 foreign coins, mainly French. The treasure had belonged to the 
Scandinavian invaders in the host of the Danish Kings of Northumbria, 
and very many bore the mark of York, the Danish capital. The chest 
was the treasure-chest of the Danes. The money had been seized in 
England, 890-897 ; on French coasts, 897-910; and collected among the 
Danes of Northumbria about 911. In that year, we know, the Danes 
raided Mercia, and were followed by the English King and thoroughly 
defeated. Their treasurer, Osberth, was killed, and it is argued that 
the Danes fell back by the Roman road, and were trying to cross into 
Northumbria by the ford at Cuerdale, but that, the ford being dangerous, 
they were obliged to bury their treasure-chest forty yards on the southern 
bank of the river. They were unable to cross, were cooped up in a bend 
of the stream, and were all put to the sword. Mr. Lang discussed this 
from the folklore point of view in the Morning Post, znd November, 1906, 
and concludes that ‘‘ granting that none who knew the site of the deposit 
escaped, the theory marches well, and quite accounts for the presence of 
the hoard where it was found. The Danish rearguard defending the line 
of the Darwen would know that their treasure was hurried forward and 
probably concealed, but would not know the exact spot.” 
Another good example is recorded in the Antiguary, xiv. 228. Further 
Henderson notes that the Borderers of England and Scotland entrusted 
their buried treasure to the brownie (Folklore of Northern Counties, 248). 
This is exactly the same idea which exists throughout India. ‘‘ Hidden 
treasures are under the special guardianship of supernatural beings. 
The Singhalese, however, divide the charge between demons and cobra 
capellas. Various charms are resorted to by those who wish to gain 
the treasures. A puja is sufficient with the cobras, but the demons 
require a sacrifice. Blood of a human being is the most important, but 
the Kappowas have hitherto confined themselves to a sacrifice of a white 
cock, combining its blood with their own, drawn by a slight puncture in 
the hand or foot. A Tamil, however, has resorted to human sacrifice as 
instanced by a case reported in the Ceylon Times.” —Indian Antiquary, 
1873, ii. p. 125.   
 
-P-A-G-E-52
32 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
London Bridge to the Norsemen of the tenth and 
eleventh centuries was a place of fierce fighting and 
struggle, a place of victory and death. The saga 
takes pains to describe this wondrous bridge! before 
it describes the great fight there and its capture by 
King Olaf, a fight which produced a war-rhyme which, 
in Laing’s version, begins with the same words as the 
English nursery rhyme, ‘‘London Bridge is broken 
down!”? and which Morris renders as a tribute to 
King Olaf, ‘‘thou brakest down London Bridge.” 
There is little wonder, then, that the men of King Olaf 
took back with them to saga-land a great memory of 
this bridge and this fight, transferred to it their own 
variant of the world-wide treasure legend, and made 
a legend not of money treasure, but of regained health 
to a crippled warrior. The corresponding non-British 
version of Brittany helps us to understand that the 
cure of disease was originally associated with the gains 
of treasure, and in the Norse version the treasure inci- 
dent is altogether dropped, but in its place is the 
recovery of health, a treasure more in accord with the 
sterner needs and recollections of a great fight. The 
Norse story is helpful to us as showing how London 
Bridge could enter into the legends of a people, and 
remain with them even after that people was no longer 
living in Britain, and it becomes therefore a valuable 
addition to the evidence for the more ancient transfer- 
ence from Britain to Brittany of the original legend. 
Altogether the piecing together of the items of his- 
torical value in this legend is most complete. We have

HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 33 
not only recovered for history hitherto lost conceptions 
of the place held by Roman Lundinium among the Celtic 
tribesmen, but we have recovered also evidence of 
the true culture-position of the Celtic tribesmen towards 
their Roman conquerors. The examination of this 
legend may have been long and tedious, but the result 
is, I think, commensurate. It illustrates the power of 
tradition to set historical data in their proper environ- 
ment, to restore the proportion which they bear to un- 
recorded history, and if the student will but follow the 
evidence carefully, I think he will find these results. 
We will take a step forward, and turn from local to 
personal attachments of tradition. There is a whole 
class of traditions attached to personages about whose 
historical existence there can be but little doubt, and 
just because of the accretion of tradition round them 
their historical existence has oftentimes been denied, 
The most famous example in our history is of course 
King Arthur, and so great an authority as Sir John 
Rhys is obliged to resort to a special argument to ac- 
count for the problems he is faced with. He argues, and ~ 
argues strongly, for an historic Arthur—an Arthur who 
was the British successor of the Roman emperor after 
Britain had ceased to be a part of the Roman Empire.? 
But because of the myths which have grown round 
him, he suggests that there must also have been ‘‘a 
Brythonic divinity named Arthur,” and we are thus 
introduced to a dual study of history and myth which 
does not appear to me to take us very far, and which, 
1 Rhys, The Arthurian Legend, 7. Squire, in his recent Mythology of 
the British Islands, states the case for ‘the mythological coming of 
Arthur” in cap. xxi. of his book.

in fact, just separates history from myth, instead of 
showing where they join hands. This dual conception 
of myth is indeed a rather favourite resort of those 
scholars who cannot appreciate the evidence that 
proves a character in a mythic tradition to be an actual 
historical personage. It is the basis of the famous 
Sigfried-Arminius controversy. It does duty in many 
less important cases,1 and most frequently in connec- 
tion with northern mythology, where the line between 
mythic and historical events gathering round a hero is 
generally so finely drawn as to be almost imperceptible. 
But it is so obviously a piece of special pleading on 
self-created lines that other explanation is needed. And 
another explanation is to be obtained if only students 
will rely upon the evidence of tradition itself instead 
of appealing to every fancy derived from sources which 
have nothing to do with tradition. 
The history of King Arthur has been the subject of 
inquiry too frequently for it to be possible in these 
pages to discuss the dual theory as it has been applied 
to him, but I will attempt to show that it is quite 
unnecessary thus to explain the history of King Arthur 
by turning to the history of another of our great heroic 
figures, one of the greatest to my mind, who, like 
Arthur, has secured not only a fair share of special 
tradition belonging to himself personally, but a larger

share than others of that corpus of tradition which has 
descended from our earliest unknown ancestors, and 
become attached to the historical hero of later times—I 
- mean, Hereward, the last of the Saxon defenders of his 
land against William the Norman.! The analysis of the 
Hereward legend affords a good example of the process 
by which tradition is preserved by historical fact, and in 
its turn helps to unravel the real history which lies at 
the source. Instead, therefore, of attempting to travel 
over the voluminous literature which is the outcome of 
the King Arthur story, I will use for the same purpose 
the shorter story of Hereward the Englishman. 
We start with the fact that Hereward is unknown to 
history until his great stand in the Island of Ely 
against the might of William, the conqueror of Eng- 
land. And yet to the banners of this ‘‘unknown” 
chieftain there flocked the discontented heroism of 
England, men ranking from the noble to the peasant, 
and including such great figures as Morcar, Edwine, 
and Waltheof. I always think, too, that the little band 
of Berkshire men, who started across the country to 
join Hereward in the fens, and were intercepted and 
ut to pieces by a Norman troop,” give us more than 
passing glimpse at the estimation in which Hereward 
as held by his countrymen. Such a man command- 
ng so much, in face of so much, could not have been 
he unknown person which history makes him. 
How then can we ascertain why he was held in such

estimation? History being quite silent, tradition 
steps into the gap. It is the tradition recorded in post- 
Herewardian times, be it noted. In this great body of 
tradition, contained in a Latin MS. of the twelfth 
century, he journeys to Scotland, where he slew a bear 
and saved the people whom it had oppressed ; from 
thence to Cornwall, where he fought and slew a great 
champion, the lover of the princess; from thence to 
Ireland, where he assisted the King in war, and back 
again to Cornwall to rescue again the princess from 
a distasteful wooer, and, finally, to Flanders. Even in 
the camp of the Norman, which he visits in traditional 
fashion, he has an adventure with witches which takes 
us to the worship of wells. Much of his adventure 
is but the application of well-known traditional events,1 
and it is important to note that the geography of 
the supposed travels belongs to the very home of 
tradition, the unknown territories of the Celts, Ireland, 
Cornwall, and Scotland. 
Now all this tradition is certainly not true of Here 
ward. But what it does is to certify to his greatness i 
the eyes of his countrymen, to show that his country: 
men were anxious to explain why he was so great i 
A.D. 1070, and why before that date he was unknow 
to them. This is an important point to have gained

popular mind abhors a vacuum as much as _ the 
material world of nature does. It will fill it with its 
own conceptions, if it cannot fill it with recognised 
facts. Hereward must have been a famous man when 
he took his stand in the fens of Ely. That his bio- 
graphers explain his fame by the application of ancient 
traditions is only saying that his countrymen reckoned 
his fame as of the very highest; ordinary current events 
of the day would not suit their ideas of the fitness of 
things. Hereward was as Alfred had been, as Arthur 
had been, and so he must have his share of the national 
tradition, even as these heroes had. To say less of 
him was to have put him below the others. And 
history in this case could not help, for it was in the 
hands of Hereward’s enemies, and they were careful to 
say nothing or very little of English heroes at this 
period. The great battle of Hastings had been lost, 
but of all the English men who had fought and died 
there we only know of three names beyond those of the 
king and his house. Leofric the abbot of Peter- 
borough, Godric the sheriff of Berkshire, and Asgar 
the sheriff of London, have become known by accident, 
as it were. All others are unnamed and unhonoured. 
Therefore, when the great deeds of Hereward came to 
be chronicled, it was not enough to say he was at 
Hastings; the deeds of old must be chronicled of him 
as they had been chronicled of others. 
This accretion of popular tradition to account for the 
fame of Hereward when he took command at Ely, 
though it proclaims in the strongest terms that Here- 
ward was famous in the eyes of his countrymen, dis- 
places history therefore. Putting the case in this way, 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
    38 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
we may proceed to examine what recorded history 
exactly has to say of Hereward, and then by noting 
what it has left unsaid, we may perhaps be able to fill 
the gap by a reasonable deduction from the facts. In 
Domesday there are clearly two Herewards, one having 
lands in Lincolnshire in the time of King Edward and 
not at the date of the survey, the other having lands in 
Warwickshire in the time of King Edward and also 
at the date of the survey. Here we have two widely 
different counties and two widely different conditions, 
and it is right with all the evidence to conclude that 
they relate to different personages. The Lincolnshire 
Hereward is the hero of the fens. He held of the 
abbot of Peterborough, and Ulfcytil, who was ap- 
pointed in 1062, was the abbot in question. This 
brings us to only four years before the battle of Hast- 
ings, and another entry in Domesday, thanks to the 
scholarship of Mr. Round, proves that Hereward 
was deprived of his Lincolnshire lands not before but 
after the great fights at Hastings and in the fens. 
Therefore the story shapes itself somewhat in this 
fashion. Hereward was in England in 1062. He was 
then a man of the abbot of Peterborough; that is to 
say, a tenant bound to perform military service to his 
lord. His lord, the abbot, was at Hastings with his 
tenants, and fought there. That Hereward of all the 
abbot’s tenants should have followed his lord to 
Hastings is more than likely ; the strange thing would 
be that he should not have done so. That going 
thither nameless among the many, he should gain 
experience under Harold, though no fame has come to 
him through the historians from a field where Saxon
-P-A-G-E-59
  
HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 39 
fame was buried; that his own genius should make 
him use his experience when need arose; that among 
the English all survivors from that field who were still 
unwilling to bow the knee to William would be 
reckoned as heroes by their depressed countrymen ; 
that on this account alone he would be given rank 
above Morcar, who had kept away from Hastings—are 
the conclusions to be drawn legitimately from the 
silence as well as the actual records of history, com- 
pared with the story told by tradition. History and 
tradition are in accord, not in conflict; the gaps of 
history are filled by tradition—that tradition which was 
suitable and worthy of so:great a hero, namely the 
ancient tradition told of all heroes. Reopening these 
gaps and putting in its right place the tradition which 
had hitherto prevented them from being seen, we are 
able to appeal to history to yield up the true story of 
one of the greatest of English heroes, a story which 
shows him to have been at Hastings by the side of 
Harold, to have won fame there, to have continued the 
fight for English liberty as leader of the English 
patriots, and to have earned a place in the unsung 
English epic. 
But his place in English tradition helps us to under- 
stand the value and position of tradition in such cases, 
The traditions clustering round the name of Hereward 
do not compel us to interpret them as Hereward facts. 
The historian, however, need not on this account fear 
for Hereward. He should rather value the traditions 
as evidence of the greatness of the English hero among 
the conquered English. They applied to him the 
legends of their oldest heroes. All that was delightful
-P-A-G-E-60
  40 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
to them in tradition was attached to their present hero. 
He was worthy of a place among their greatest. And 
thus the fact of added tradition brings out the estimate 
of the worth of the hero to those among whom he lived 
and for whom he fought. 
The traditions themselves belong to far other times, 
and the facts contained in them must be interpreted from 
the oldest ideas of our race. It is only by thus disen- 
gaging the traditions which have grown round the 
historical person that the correct interpretation of the 
position can be attempted, and when that is done we 
are left, not with a mass of uncertain and misleading 
testimony about a national hero, but with certain definite 
historical facts belonging to Hereward, and certain 
traditions attached to Hereward, certifying to his 
great place in the popular estimation, telling of facts 
which do not, it is true, belong to Hereward, but which, 
in a special sense, belong to the people who were 
reverencing Hereward. 
If I have made it clear from these examples that the 
explanation of historic fact and mythic tradition in 
combination does not lead either to the discrediting of 
history or to the creation of new mythic realms, I 
need not dwell much longer on this class of illustrations 
of the relationship between history and tradition. Over 
and over again, in the local records, are examples to be 
found where history is in close contact with tradition, 
and I am far more inclined to question the evidence 
which proves the falseness of any authenticated tradi- 
tion than I am to trust all the statements which do duty 
for history. It is not only the traditions looming largely 
in popular interest, but some of the smallest local
-P-A-G-E-61
HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 41 
traditions which throw light on great historical events. 
They may tell us not merely of the great historical 
event, but of the peculiar relationship of parts of the 
kingdom to that event, which no purely historical evi- 
dence could by any possibility explain. One of the most 
striking examples is, perhaps, the Sussex tradition of 
“Duke” William as a conqueror.! The title Duke is 
here faithfully recorded of the great conqueror, who 
everywhere else in England, both in historical docu- 
ments and in the popular language, is referred to as 
king. The explanation is, if the identification of this 
tradition with the great Norman king is correct, that 
Sussex being more or less separated from the rest of 
the country by its great weald, carried its own tradition 
of the bloody field at Hastings sufficiently long and 
uninterrupted for it to be stamped upon the minds of 
the people in its original form, and thus to remain. No 
better evidence could be found for the relationship of 
Sussex to this great event. All the chapters in Mr. 
Freeman’s great history do not impress the imagination 
so strongly as this one fact, that William the Conqueror 
has always been Duke William to the Sussex folk. He 
was Duke William to the fen folk, too. They fought 
for their belief and were compelled to accept his king- 
ship. The Sussex folk fought, too, and they handed 
down their conception of the great fight to their children. 
A good example of a slightly different kind occurs 
in connection with Kett’s rebellion in Norfolk. It 
was associated with a prophecy that said, ‘‘there 
shulde lande at Walborne hope the proudest prince of 
Christendome, and so shall come to Moshold heethe, 
1 Journ. Anthrop, Inst., iii. 52. 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
* 
  42 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
and there shuld mete with other ij kinges, and shall 
fyght and shalbe put down: and the whyte lyon shuld 
optayne” the mastery. And yet this prophecy goes 
much further back, for the Danes are said to have 
landed at Weybourne Hope in their invasions, and the 
old ryhme is still remembered in the county :— 
“He that would England win 
Must at Weybourn Hope begin.” ? 
This is an example of the forcible revival of an ancient 
tradition to suit a later fact, and is evidence of the 
enormous impression which the event to which it refers 
had upon the locality. Kett’s rebellion was one thing 
to the nation at large and quite another thing to this 
district of Norfolk, and the great events of the tenth 
century preserved in legend were equated with the 
minor events of the sixteenth century, thus enabling 
us to understand better the depth of the local feeling 
which produced these events. 
Both local and personal traditions are of interest in 
the unravelling of the meaning of historical events, and 
the forces at the back of them, and I will add a note of 
one or two examples of those humbler traditions which 
confirm or enhance the value of the historical record. 
They are of the greatest importance if correctly under- 
stood. They include such examples, for instance, as 
Mr. Kemble notes when he says, ‘‘I have more than 
once walked, ridden, or rowed, as land and stream 
required, round the bounds of Anglo-Saxon estates, and 
have learned with astonishment that the names recorded 
in my charter were those still used by the woodcutter or

the shepherd of the neighbourhood.”1 This is remark- 
able testimony to the persistence of tradition. It is the 
commencing point of a whole series of examples which 
go to show that embedded in the memories of the 
people, and supported by no other force but tradition, 
there are innumerable traces of historic fact.? 
A stage forward, in the same class of tradition, are 
those examples of special names which indicate an 
important or impressive event, the real nature of 
which is only revealed by modern discovery. Thus 
perhaps the ‘‘White Horse Stone” at Aylesford, in 
Kent, the legend of which is that one who rode a 
beast of this description was killed on or about this 
spot,® may take us back to the great battle at Crayford, 
where Horsa was killed. Another kind of local tradi- 
tion is perhaps more instructive. Immediately con- 
tiguous to the north side of the Roman road at 
Litlington, near Royston, were some strips of un- 
enclosed, but cultivated, land, which in ancient deeds 
from time immemorial had been called ‘‘ Heaven’s 
1 Kemble’s Hore Ferales, 108. 
2 Perhaps the most interesting example in a minor way comes from 
Shrewsbury. In the Abbey Church, forming part of a font, is the upper 
stone of a cross (supposed to have been the Weeping Cross) which 
was discovered at St. Giles’s churchyard. It had been immemorially 
fixed in the ditch bank, and all traces of its origin were quite lost, ex- 
cept that an old lady, who was born in 1724, remembered having seen in 
her youth, persons kneeling before this stone and praying. The trans- 
mission of the tradition through very nearly three centuries proved 
correct, for on its being loosened by the frosts of a severe winter, it 
fell, and its religious distinction became immediately apparent from the 
sculpture with which it was adorned.—Zddowes’ Shrewsbury Journal, 5th 
October, 1889.

this tradition may be tested by reference to my book on the Governance

Walls.” Traditional awe attached to this spot, and 
the village children were afraid to traverse it after dark, 
when it was said to be frequented by supernatural 
beings. Here is subject for inquiry. Both words 
in the name are significant. Why the allusion to 
Heaven; why is a field called walls? The problem 
was solved in 1821, for in that year some labourers 
were digging for gravel on this spot, and they struck 
upon an old wall composed of flint and Roman brick. 
This accidental discovery was followed up by Dr. 
Webb, and the wall was found to enclose a rectangular 
space measuring about thirty-eight yards by twenty- 
seven, and containing numerous deposits of sepulchral 
urns containing ashes of the dead. It was clear 
from the results of the excavations that here was 
one of those large plots of ground environed by 
walls to which the name of wustrinum was given 
by the Romans,! a fact which was preserved in the 
1 Archeologia, xxvi, 369-370. One could give many additional examples 
from all parts of the country, and undoubtedly they are worth collecting. 
Icannot refrain from quoting the following, as it is from an out-of-the- 
way source. At Seagry, in Wilts, is an ancient farm, one field of which 
was known as ‘Peter's Orchard.” The author of a local history 
records the following: ‘‘It has been handed down from generation to 
generation that in a field on this farm a church was built on the 
site of an ancient heathen burial ground. In order to test the accuracy 
of this tradition, in the autumn of 1882 I had excavations made on the 
spot, which I will now describe. The field contains about ten acres, 
and presents a very singular appearance. In removing the sods, about 
two feet from the surface we discovered extensive stone foundations, 
extending for a considerable distance over the field. From the charred 
appearance of the stones they had evidently suffered from fire, thus 
supporting the tradition of some of the oldest inhabitants that the 
ancient church had been destroyed by fire. On continuing the search 
we found, about two feet below these foundations, a quantity of early 
British pottery, the remains of broken urns, some charred bones, and 
heads of small spears. The following is an extract from a letter which 
 
-P-A-G-E-67

     HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 45 
name long after the site had lost every trace of its 
origin. 
I will refer to one more local example. In Dorset- 
shire and Wiltshire fairs are held upon sites which 
are often marked by the remains of ancient works, or 
distinguished by some dim tradition of vanished im- 
portance. One has only to refer to the history of the 
market as ‘‘a contribution to the early history of 
human intercourse” as Mr. Grierson puts it,? and to 
the extremely important and archaic constitution of the 
market, a glimpse of which has been afforded by Sir 
Henry Maine, alone among scholars who have in- 
vestigated earliest English institutions, to know how 
valuable such a note as this must be if it can be con- 
firmed by extended research. Local investigation of 
these places and their traditions would, no doubt, lead 
to many points in the tribal settlement of the district, 
an important fact of history nowhere found in history. 
No one, I think, taking into consideration this view 
Ihave received froma gentleman, whose family have been connected with 
this parish for over two hundred years, and who has given me great 
assistance. He says: My father was born at Startley in 1784, and 
remained there until about 1840. Both he and my grandfather were 
deeply imbued with old folklore. I well remember them constantly 
speaking of the firm belief handed down to them of the heathen burial 
places at Seagry, and of the supposed ruins of a church and some 
religious house at Seagry. I think the discoveries made (on the very 
spot mentioned by tradition) in August, 1882, are abundant proof that 
after the lapse of more than nine centuries actual verification of the 
carefully transmitted tradition has at last been found.”—Bath Herald, 
ist September, 1883. If references to other examples were needed I 
should like to note Sir William Wilde's illustration as to ‘‘how far the 
legend, the fairy tale, the local tradition, or the popular superstition 
may have been derived from absolute historic fact.”—Lough Corrib, 
i@t,24°

  46 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
of the relationship of local and personal traditions to 
history will deny that history is likely to gain much by 
the proper interpretation of such traditions. Every 
yard of British territory has its historic interest, and 
there are innumerable peaks above the general level 
which should be worth much to national history. Every 
epoch of British history has its great personage, who 
in popular opinion stands out from among his fellows. 
When once it is understood that traditions attaching to 
places and persons yield facts of a kind worth searching 
for, there will arise the desire to obtain all that is now 
obtainable from this source, and to add thereto the 
deductions to be drawn from their geographical dis- 
tribution. 
II 
If the accretion of myth around the lives of great 
historic personages, and the persistence of tradition 
in historic localities, may be accepted as one phase 
of the necessary relationship of tradition to history, 
we may proceed to inquire how far the unattached 
traditions, the folk-tales pure and simple, contain 
or are based upon historic details. These details 
will not tell us of any one historic personage, or re- 
late to any one historic locality, but will relate to 
the peoples before personages and localities figured 
in their history, and will explain facts in culture-his- 
tory rather than in political history. We shall be 
approaching the period before written history had 
begun, and for which, so far as written history is 
concerned, we are dependent upon foreign or outside 
authority. I think, perhaps, Dr. Karl Pearson has
-P-A-G-E-71
  
HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 47 
put the case for this view in the best form. ‘As we 
read fairy stories to our children,” he says, 
“we may study history for ourselves. No longer oppressed 
with the unreal and the davogue, we may see primitive human 
customs and the life of primitive man and woman crop- 
ping out at almost every sentence of the nursery tale. 
Written history tells us little of these things, they must 
be learnt, so to speak, from the mouths of babes. But 
there they are in the Marchen, as invaluable fossils for those 
who will stoop to pick them up and study them. Back in 
the far past we can build up the life of our ancestry—the 
little kingdom, the queen or her daughter as king maker, 
the simple life of the royal household, and the humble candi- 
date for the kingship, the priestess with her control of the 
weather and her power over youth and maid. In the dim- 
mest distance we can see traces of the earlier kindred group 
marriage, and in the near foreground the beginnings of that 
fight with patriarchal institutions which led the priestess to 
be branded by the new Christian civilization as the evil- 
working witch of the Middle Ages.” 
I should not have ventured to quote this long pas- 
sage if my own studies, before Dr. Pearson’s book 
was published in 1897, had not led me to much the 
same conclusions.? But Dr. Pearson assists me in 
a special way. His methods are scientific. He is 
not a folklorist because he loves folklore, but because 
1 Pearson’s Chances of Death, ii. 90. The reader should consult Dr. 
Pearson’s entire study on this subject, chapters ix. and x., which may 
be compared with Mr. MacCulloch’s Childhood of Fiction, 5-15, and 
more particularly with Mr. Hartland’s Science of Fairy Tales. 
2 In 1881 I read a paper before the Folklore Society on ‘Some 
Incidents in the story of the Three Noodles by means of reference to 
facts,” Folklore Record, iv. 211, and in 1883 I published in the Az/fi- 
quary, two papers on ‘Notes on Incidents in Folk-tales,” based upon 
the same idea,

he sees in it the materials for elucidating the early life 
of man. He is not, so to speak, prejudiced in its 
favour. He brings to his aid the practical mind of 
the statistician and the psychologist, and his conclu- 
sions may not, therefore, be put on one side as easily 
as those of myself and other students of folklore. 
It is due to the folklorist, however, to say that 
this aspect of the folk-tale had already been discovered 
by one of the greatest of the earlier collectors of 
traditional lore, the late Mr. J. F. Campbell. Thus, 
writing, in 1860, of his grand collection of ‘ High- 
land Tales,” Mr. Campbell very truly says: ‘‘The 
tales represent the actual everyday life of those who 
tell them, with great fidelity. They have done the 
same, in all likelihood, time out of mind, and that which 
is not true of the present is, in all probability, true of 
the past; and therefore something may be learned of 
forgotten ways of life.”1 Readers of Mr. Campbell’s 
books well know how he has traced out from these tradi- 
tions from the nursery, identical customs with Highland 
everyday life, and relics also of a long-forgotten past 
state of things; how he points to the records of the 
stone age and the iron age in these representatives of 
the scientific memoirs of the past; how very signifi- 
cantly he answers his own supposition, that if these 
tales ‘‘are dim recollections of savage times and savage 
people, then other magic gear, the property of giants, 
fairies, and bogles, should resemble things which are 
precious now amongst savage or half-civilized tribes, or 
which really have been prized amongst the old inhabi- 
tants of these islands or of other parts of the world.”

HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 49 
This is an extremely important conclusion on the 
relationship of history and tradition, and it will be well 
to illustrate it by turning to some obvious details of 
primitive life, which are to be seen with more or less 
clearness enshrined in the folk-tales which have been 
preserved in our own country. 
In Kennedy’s Fireside Stories of Ireland, it is related 
in one of the tales that there was no window to the mud- 
wall cabin, and the door was turned to the north ;+ 
and then, again, we have this picture given to us in 
another story : on a common that had in the middle of 
it a rock or great pile of stones overgrown with furze 
bushes, there was a dwelling-house, and a cow- 
house, and a goat’s-house, and a pigsty all scooped out 
of the rock; and the cows were going into the byre, 
and the goats into their house, but the pigs were grunt- 
ing and bawling before the door.? This takes us to the 
surroundings of the cave-dwelling people. 
Then in other places we come across relics of ancient 
agricultural life preserved in these stories. In the Irish 
story of ‘‘ Hairy Rouchy” the heroine is fastened by 
her wicked sisters in a pound,’ an incident not mentioned 
in the parallel Highland tale related by Campbell.* 
Many Irish stories contain details of primitive life that 
the Scottish variants do not contain. The field that 
was partly cultivated with corn and partly pasture for 
the cow,® the grassy ridge upon which the princess 
sat, and the furrows wherein her two brothers were 
lying,® are instances.

  50 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
A great question arises here. If the Scotch story does 
not mention the primitive incident mentioned in the Irish 
story, does it mean that the Irish story has retained for 
a longer time the details of its primitive original? Or 
does it mean that it has absorbed more of surrounding 
Irish life into it than the Scotch story has of surrounding 
Scottish life ? 
These details must have a place in the elucidation 
of Irish folk-tales, because they have a very distinct 
place indeed in primitive institutions; and it hence 
becomes a question to folklorists as to how they have 
entered into, or escaped from, the narrative of tradi- 
tional story. It appears to me that the appearance 
or non-appearance of these phases of early life are 
typical of what has been going on with the plot 
and structure of folk-tales as long as they have re- 
mained the traditional treasures of the people. A 
story identical in all the main outlines of plot will be 
varied in matters of detail, according to the people who 
are using it in their daily routine of story-telling. But 
this variation is always from the primitive to the 
cultured, from the simple to the complex. The mud- 
cabin or cave-dwelling in Irish story would have de- 
veloped into the palace in stories of a richer country like 
England ; the old woman, young girl, master and ser- 
vant, would become perhaps the queen, princess, king 
and vassal ; just as in Spanish and Portuguese stories 
the giant of other European tales is represented by 
“the Moor.” If this process of change is a factor 
in the life of the folk-tale, it follows that those folk- 
tales which contain the greatest number of primitive 
details are the most ancient, and come to us more 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 51 
directly from the prehistoric times which they repre- 
sent. 
We may gather warrant for such a conclusion if we 
pass from small details to a distinct institution. The 
institution which stands out most clearly in early history 
is the tribe, and I will therefore turn to an element 
of ancient tribal life, and an element which has to do 
with the practical organisation of that life, namely, the 
tribal assembly. We find that the folk-tale records 
under its fairy or non-historic guise many important 
recollections of the assembly of the tribe. One very 
natural feature of this assembly in early times was its 
custom of meeting in the open air—a custom which 
in later times still obtained, for reasons which were 
the outcome of the prejudices existing in favour of 
keeping up old customs. These reasons are recorded 
in the formula of Anglo-Saxon times, that meetings 
should not be held in any building, lest magic might 
have power over the members of the assembly. 
Before turning to the tales of our own country, I will 
first see whether savage and barbaric tales have re- 
corded anything on the subject, for their picture of the 
tribal assembly, when revealed in the folk-tale, belongs 
to the period which might have witnessed the making 
of the story, and which certainly witnessed the tribal 
organisation of the people as a living institution. 
Dr. Callaway, in his Nursery Tales and Traditions 
of the Zulus, relates a story of ‘‘the Girl-King.” 
‘““Where there are many young women,” says the 
tory, ‘‘they assemble on the river where they live, 
nd appoint a chief over the young women, that no 
1 See Beda, Hist. Ecclesia, lib. i. cap. 25. 
     
                                           
    
  
-P-A-G-E-76
52 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
young woman may assume to act for herself. Well, 
then they assemble and ask each other, ‘Which among 
the damsels is fit to be chief and reign well?’ They 
make many inquiries; one after another is nominated 
and rejected, until at length they agree together to 
appoint one, saying, ‘Yes, so and so shall reign.’”* 
However far this may be actually separated from the 
political assembly of the Zulus, there is no doubt we 
have here a folk-tale adaptation of events which were 
happening around the relators of the tale. This is 
all I am anxious to state, indeed. What in the folk- 
tale was related of the girl-king, was a reflex only of 
what happened when the political chieftain himself was 
concerned. 
This, perhaps, is still better illustrated if we turn to 
India. In the story of ‘‘How the Three Clever Men 
outwitted the Demons,” told by Miss Frere in her Old 
Deccan Days, it is related how ‘‘a demon was com- 
pelled to bring treasure to the pundit’s house, and on 
being asked why he had been so long away, answered, 
‘All my fellow-demons detained me, and would hardly 
let me go, they were so angry at my bringing you so 
much treasury; and though I told them how great and 
powerful you are, they would not believe me, but will, 
as soon as I return, judge me in solemn council for 
serving you.’ ‘Where is your council held?’ asked 
the pundit. ‘Oh! very far, far away,’ answered the 
demon, ‘in the depths of the jungle, where our rajah 
daily holds his court.’ The three men, the pundit, the 
wrestler, and the pearl-shooter, are taken by the demon 
to witness the trial. . . . They reached the great jungle

where the durbar (council) was to be held, and there he 
(the demon) placed them on the top of a high tree just 
over the demon rajah’s throne. Ina few minutes they 
heard a rustling noise, and thousands and thousands of 
demons filled the place, covering the ground as far as 
the eye could reach, and thronging chiefly round the 
rajah’s throne. ”? 
A classical story told by AZlian gives us another in- 
teresting example of this feature of early political life. 
It is said of the Lady Rhodopis, who was alike fair and 
frail, that of all the beautiful women in Egypt, she was 
by far the most beautiful ; and the story goes that one 
time when she was bathing, Fortune, which always was 
a lover of whatever may be the most unlikely and un- 
expected, bestowed upon her rank and dignity that 
were alone suitable for her transcendent charms; and 
this was the way what I am now going to tell came to 
pass. Rhodopis, before taking a bath, had given her 
robes in charge to her attendants ; but at the same time 
there was an eagle flying over the bath, and it darted 
down and flew away with one of her slippers. The 
eagle flew away, and away, and away, until it got 
to the city of Memphis, where the Prince Psamme- 
tichus was sitting in the open air, and administering 
justice to those subject to his sway; and as the eagle 
flew over him it let the slipper fall from its beak, and it 
fell down into the lap of Psammetichus. The prince 
looked at the slipper, and the more he looked at it, the 
more he marvelled at the beauty of the material and the 
dainty minuteness of its size; and then he cogitated 
upon the wondrous way in which such a thing was con-

veyed to him through the air by a bird; and then it was 
he sent forth a proclamation to all parts of Egypt totry | 
to discover the woman to whom the slipper belonged, 
and solemnly promised that whoever she might be he 
would make her his bride.* 
A very beautiful legend, which has been preserved 
by the Rev. W. S. Lach-Szyrma,? carries into its fairy 
narrative more of the realities of tribal life. Mr. Lach- 
Szyrma obtained it from a peasant’s chap-book, but it 
professes to be an ancient Slovac folk-tale :— 
‘* An orphan girl is left with a cruel stepmother, who 
has a daughter who is bad-tempered and disagree- 
able, and extremely jealous of her. She becomes the 
Cinderella of the house, is ill-treated and beaten, but 
submits patiently. At last the harsh stepmother is 
urged by her daughter to get rid of her. It is winter, 
in the month of January ; the snow has fallen, and the 
ground is frozen. The cruel stepmother in this dread- 
ful weather bids the poor girl to go out in the forest, 
and not to come back till she brings some violets with 
her. After many entreaties for mercy the orphan is 
driven out, and goes out in the snow on the hopeless 
errand. As she enters the forest she sees a little way 
on in the deep glade, under the leafless trees, a large 
fire burning. As she draws near she perceives around 
the fire are twelve stones, and on the stones sit twelve 
men. The chief of them, sitting on the largest stone, 
is an old man with a long snowy beard, and a great 
staff in his hand. As she comes up to the fire the old 
man asks her what she wants. She respectfully replies

by telling them, with many tears, her sad story. The 
old man comforts her. ‘Iam January; I cannot give 
you any violets, but brother March can.’ So he turns 
to a fine young man near him and says, ‘ Brother 
March, sit in my place.’ Presently the air around 
grows softer. The snows around the fire melt. The 
green grass appears, the flower-buds are to be seen. 
At the orphan girl’s feet a bed of violets appear. She 
stoops and plucks a beautiful bouquet, which she brings 
home to her astounded stepmother.” 
How clearly this is a representation of the tribal 
assembly worked into the folk-tale, where January 
and the months are the tribal chiefs, may be illustrated 
by a comparison with the actual events of Indian tribal 
life. Within the stockaded village of Supar-Punji, in 
Bengal, are two or three hundred monuments, large 
and small, all formed of circular, solid stone slabs, sup- 
ported by upright stones, set on end, which enclose the 
space below. On these the villagers sit on occasions 
of state, each on his own stool, large or small, accord- 
ing to his rank in the commonwealth.! 
Now evidence such as this, showing how the folk-tale 
among primitive people gets framed according to the 
social conditions within which it originates, will help 
us to realise the peculiar value of similar features 
which may be found in the folk-tales of our own country. 
English tales are nearly destitute of such illustrations 
of primitive tribal life as this. Some of the giant 
stories of Cornwall, such as that relating to the loose, 
uncut stones in the district of Lanyon Quoit, on whose 
tors ‘‘they do say the giants sit,”? may refer to the 
1 Asiatic Researches, xvii. p. 502. * Folklore Record, vol, iii. p. 284.  
-P-A-G-E-82
  56 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
tribal assembly place, but it is shorn of all its necessary 
details, and we do not get many examples even in this 
shortened form. 
Curiously enough, too, we find but little mention in 
the Scotch tales of the open-air gatherings of the tribe. 
The following quotation may refer to the custom per- 
haps, but it is not conclusive: ‘‘On the day when 
O’Donull came out to hold right and justice . . .” 
(there were twelve men with him).t Another story 
is more exact. Mr. Campbell took it down from a 
fisherman in Barra (ii. 137). The hero-child Conall 
tends the sheep of a widow with whom he lodged. 
‘*To feed these sheep he broke down the dykes which 
guarded the neighbours’ fields. The neighbours made 
complaint to the king, and asked for justice. The king 
gave foolish judgment, whereat his neck was turned 
awry, and the judgment-seat kicked. Conall gave a 
correct decision and released the king. He did this a 
second time, and the people said he must have king’s 
blood in him.” This allusion to the kicking of the 
judgment-seat is a very instructive illustration of tribal 
chieftainship and comes within that branch of the 
subject with which we are now dealing. 
But when we pass from Britain to Ireland, there is 
at once a great storehouse of examples to be given. 
In Dr. Joyce’s Old Celtic Romances there are some 
remarkable passages, which give us a good picture of 
the assemblies of primitive times. These passages, it 
should be noted, occur quite incidentally during the 
course of the story—they belong to the same era as the 
fairy-legend, the giant, and the witch, and taken as

types of what was going on everywhere in prehistoric 
times, they tell us much that is very valuable. 
A great fair-meeting was held by the King of Ire- 
land, Nuada of the Silver Hand, on the Hill of Usna. 
Not long had the people been assembled, when they 
beheld a stately band of warriors, all mounted on white 
steeds, coming towards them from the east, and at 
their head rode a young champion, tall and comely. 
‘‘This young warrior was Luga of the Long Arms.... 
This troop came forward to where the King of Erin 
sat surrounded by the Dedannans, and both parties 
exchanged friendly greetings. A short time after this 
they saw another company approaching, quite unlike 
the first, for they were grim and surly-looking; namely, 
the tax-gatherers of the Fomorians, to the number of 
nine nines, who were coming to demand their yearly 
tribute from the men of Erin. When they reached the 
place where the king sat, the entire assembly—the 
king himself among the rest—rose up before them.” 
Here, without following the story further, the assemb- 
ling in arms, the payment of the tributes at the council- 
hill, the sitting of the king and his assembly, are all 
significant elements of the primitive assembly. In a 
later part of the same story we have ‘‘the Great Plain 
of the Assembly ” mentioned (p. 48). Another graphic 
picture is given a little later on, when the warrior Luga, 
above mentioned, demands justice upon the slayers of 
his father, at the great council on Tara hill. Luga 
asked the king that the chain of silence should be 
shaken; and when it was shaken, when all were 
listening in silence, he stood up and made his plea, 
which ended in the eric-fine being imposed upon the

three children of Turenn, the accomplishment of which 
forms the basis of the fairy-tale which follows (p. 54). 
Then, in another place in the same tale, when the 
brothers are on their adventurous journey, fulfilling 
their eric-fine, they come to the house of the King of 
Sigar; and it ‘‘happened that the king was holding 
a fair-meeting on the broad, level green before the 
palace.” 
In another story the hero Maildun asks the island 
queen how she passes her life, and the reply is, 
“The good king who formerly ruled over this 
island was my husband. He died after a long reign, 
and as he left no son, I now reign, the sole ruler 
of the island. And every day I go to the Great 
Plain, to administer justice and to decide causes 
among my people.” 
The beginning of another story is—‘‘Once upon 
a time, a noble, warlike king ruled over Lochlann, 
whose name was Colga of the Hard Weapons. On 
a certain occasion, this king held a meeting of his chief 
people, on the broad, green plain before his palace of 
Berva. And when they were all gathered together, 
he spoke to them in a loud, clear voice, from where he 
sat high on his throne; and he asked them whether 
they found any fault with the manner in which he ruled 
them, and whether they knew of anything deserving 
of blame in him as their sovereign lord and king. 
They replied, as if with the voice of one man, that they 
found no fault of any kind.” 
The last example is also a valuable one. A dispute} 
has occurred respecting the enchanted horse, the Gill 
Dacker, and ‘‘a meeting was called on the green t

hear the award.” Speeches are made and the awards 
are given.? 
I think it will be admitted that the folk-tales of Britain 
refer back in such cases to the organisation of the tribe 
in early times, and the only possible conclusion to be 
drawn from this fact is that they too belong to early 
times and that they have brought with them to modern 
days these valuable fragments of history which are 
hardly to be discovered in any other historical docu- 
ment. 
We have thus shown that the folk-tale contains many 
fragmentary details of ancient social conditions, and 
further that it contains more than mere details in the 
larger place it assigns to important features of tribal 
institutions. It now remains to see whether apart from 
incident the very structure and heart of the folk-tale 
is founded upon conceptions of life. I will take as an 
example the well-known story of Catskin. This story 
contains one remarkable feature running through many 
of the variants, and a second which is found in prac- 
tically all of them. Both these features are perfectly 
impossible to modern creative fancy, and I venture to 
think we shall find their true origin in the actual facts 
of primitive life, not in the wondrous flight of primitive 
fancy. 
The opening incidents of ‘‘Catskin” are thus re- 
lated :— : 
‘A certain king, having lost his wife, and mourned 
for her even more than other men do, suddenly deter- 
1 Joyce, Old Celtic Romances, 38, 75, 153, 177, 270. In the Silva

mines, by way of relieving his sorrows, to marry his 
own daughter. The princess obtains a suspension of 
this odious purpose by requiring from him three beauti- 
ful dresses, which take a long time to prepare. These 
dresses are a robe of the colour of the sky, a robe of 
the colour of the moon, a third robe of the colour of 
the sun, the latter being embroidered with the rubies 
and diamonds of his crown. The three dresses being 
made and presented to her, the princess is checkmated, 
and accordingly asks for something even more valuable 
in its way. The king has an ass that produces gold coins 
in profusion every day of his life. This ass the princess 
asked might be sacrificed, in order that she might have 
his skin. This desire even was granted. The princess, 
thus defeated altogether, puts on the ass’s skin, rubs 
her face over with soot, and runs away. She takes a 
situation with a farmer’s wife to tend the sheep and 
turkeys of the farm.” 
The remainder of the story much resembles Cinder- 
ella’s famous adventures, and I need not repeat it 
here. The pith of the story turns upon the fact that a 
father purposes to marry his own daughter, or, in some 
versions, his daughter-in-law; and the daughter, 
naturally, as we say, objecting to this arrangement, 
runs away, and hence her many adventures. This 
famous story, told by English nurses to English 
children, long before literature stepped across the 
sacred precincts of the nursery, is also told in Ire- 
land and Scotland. It is also current in France, 
Italy, Germany, Russia, Lithuania, and many other 
nations ; and throughout all these versions, differing, 
of course, in some matters of detail, the self-
-P-A-G-E-89
  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 61 
same incident is observable—the father wishing to 
marry his own daughter, and the daughter running 
away.! This incident, therefore, must be older than the 
several nations who have preserved it from their 
common home, where the tale was originally told with 
a special value that is now lost. It must then belong 
to primitive man, and not to civilised man, and must be 
judged by the standard of morals belonging to primi- 
tive man. It is not sufficient, or, indeed, in any way to 
the point, to say that the idea of marrying one’s own 
daughter is horrible and detestable to modern ideas ; 
we must place ourselves in a position to judge of 
such a state of affairs from an altogether different 
standpoint. And what do we find in primitive society ? 
We find that women were the property, not the help- 
mates, of their husbands. And the question hence 
arises, in what relation did the children stand in respect 
to their parents? The answer comes from almost all 
parts of the primitive world that, in certain stages of 
society, the children were related to their mother only. 
It is worth while pausing one moment to give evidence 
upon the fact. Thus McLennan says of the Australians, 
‘Cit is not in quarrels uncommon to find children of the 
same father arrayed against one another, or indeed, 
against their father himself; for by their peculiar law 
the father can never be a relative of his children.”? This 
is not the language, though it is the evidence, of the 
latest research, and another phase of it is represented

by the custom, as among the Ahts of Vancouver Island, 
that in case of separation while the children are 
young, the children go always with the mother to their 
own tribe.? 
Here we see that the relationship between father and 
daughter was in no way considered in ancient society 
of the type to which Australians and Ahts belonged, 
and it is now one of the accepted facts of anthro- 
pology that at certain stages of savage life father- 
hood was not recognised. That this non-relationship 
of the father very often resulted in the further stage 
of the father marrying his daughter, is exemplified by 
many examples. The story of Lot and his daughters, 
for instance, will at once occur to the reader, and 
upon this Mr. Fenton has some observations, to 
which I may refer the student who wishes to pursue 
this curious subject further,? while Mr. Frazer, in 
his recent study of Adonis, has discussed the practice 
with his usual extent of knowledge.’ Again, it should 
be remembered that in our own chronicle histories 
Vortigern is said to have married his own daughter, 
though the legend and the supposed consequences of 
the marriage have been twisted from their original 
primitive surroundings by the monkish chroniclers, 
through whom we obtain the story.* Turning next to the 
daughter-in-law, supposing that the difference between 
“daughter” and “daughter-in-law” (query step- 
daughter) in the story variants is a vital difference, and

  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 63 
not an accidental difference, there is curious and im- 
portant evidence from India. The following custom pre- 
vails among certain classes of Sudras, particularly the 
Vella-lahs in Koimbator: ‘‘A father marries a grown-up 
girl eighteen or twenty years old to his son, a boy of 
seven or eight, after which he publicly lives with his 
daughter-in-law, until the youth attains his majority, 
when his wife is made over to him, generally with half 
a dozen children. These children are taught to address 
him as their father. In several cases this woman 
becomes the common wife of the father and son. She 
pays every respect due to her wedded husband, and 
takes great care of him from the time of her marriage. 
The son, in his turn, hastens to celebrate the marriage 
of his acquired son, with the usual pomps, ceremonies, 
and tumasha, and keeps the bride for himself as his 
father had done.”! But even further than this, ancient 
Hindu law allowed the father, who had no prospect of 
having legitimate sons, to ‘‘appoint” or nominate a 
daughter who should bear a son to himself, and not to 
her own husband.? Sir Henry Maine gives the formula 
for this remarkable appointment, and then goes on to 
say that some customs akin to the Hindu usage of ap- 
pointing a daughter appear to have been very widely 
diffused over the ancient world, and traces of them are 
found far down in history.* 
What we have before us, therefore, to guide us 
in the view we take of the story incident of a father

marrying his own daughter, may be summarised as 
follows :— 
1. The father is not related to his daughter, and hence 
examples occur of fathers marrying daughters. 
2. The custom of marrying a daughter-in-law. 
3. The custom of nominating a daughter to bear a 
son.    
   
      
    
                               From any one of these facts of primitive life we 
arrive at the central incident in the story of Catskin: 
the father could marry his daughter without specially 
shocking the society of the primitive world, simply be- 
cause, according to primitive ideas, father and daughter, 
as we call her, were not related. 
We now arrive at the second incident—the running 
away of Catskin. This again is a very early form of 
marriage custom. Women of primitive times often 
objected to the forced marriages, and they expressed 
their objection very often by running away. In the in- 
stance of Catskin the running away was successful, 
as we all know; but in most instances the unwilling 
bride was captured and forced to surrender. Mr. 
Farrer, in his Primitive Manners and Customs, quite 
clears the ground for the refutation of an argument 
that might be applied if we did not know the customs 
of primitive society. It might be asked, why did Cat- 
skin run away if the custom was a usual one? For the 
same reason, we answer, that the women of savage 
society often do run away—objection to the marriage. 
1 A most remarkable instance of an actual case of running away 
from a marriage, resulting in adventures which might easily become 
folk-tale adventures if the story were once started on its traditional life, 
is to be found in Shooter's Kafirs of Natal and the Zulu Country, 
pp. 60-71,
-P-A-G-E-93
  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 65 
Thus we have to note that the two principal features 
of our ordinary Catskin story are explainable by a 
reference to primitive manners and customs; and it 
seems to me much easier and much more reasonable to 
thus explain the origin of the Catskin story, than first 
of all to create a ‘“‘lovely myth,” as the mythologists 
would undoubtedly have a right to call it, of the Sun 
pursuing the Dawn, and then to say that the Catskin 
story is simply a relation of this myth. 
The opening incident of the Catskin story, as thus 
interpreted, is not an isolated case of the survival of 
primitive marriage customs in popular stories. If it 
were so, there would be considerable difficulty in 
the way of supporting this interpretation. But it is 
only saying of Catskin what can be said of other 
stories. ‘‘There are traces,” says Mr. Campbell, 
speaking of his Highland stories, ‘“‘of foreign or 
forgotten laws and customs. A man buys a wife as 
he would a cow, and acquires a right to shoot her, 
which is acknowledged as good law.”! Yes, this is 
good savage law and custom there is no doubt, and 
Lord Avebury and Mr. McLennan have illustrated 
it by examples. But in the Highland story of the 
‘Battle of the Birds” the wife is sought to be pur- 
chased for a hundred pounds (Campbell, i. 36), and in 
the Irish story of the ‘‘ Lazy Beauty and her Aunts” 
we find something like bride-capture and purchase as 
well.? So, again, if we turn to India the same kind of 
evidence is forthcoming of another part of the primi- 
tive ceremony. ‘‘Do not think,” retorted the Malee

in a story collected by Miss Frere, ‘‘that I’ll make 
a fool of myself because I’m only a Malee, and 
believe what you’ve got to say because you're a great 
Rajah. If you mean what you say, if you care for my 
daughter and wish to be married to her, come and be 
married ; but I’ll have none of your new-fangled forms 
and court ceremonies hard to be understood; let the 
girl be married by her father’s hearth, and under her 
father’s roof.”! And in another story of the ‘‘Chun- 
dun Rajah” we have ‘‘the scattering rice and flowers 
upon their heads ;”? the significance of both of which 
customs are fully known. 
These illustrations of the contact, the necessary con- 
tact, of tradition and history show that contact to be 
equally true of the folk-tale as it is of the local or 
personal legend. They all point to the substratum 
of fact underlying tradition, to the absorption by 
tradition of many features of the life by which it 
is surrounded, or to the absorption by some great 
historic person or event of the living tradition of 
his time or place. This contact is a fact equally 
important to history and to folklore. It cannot be 
neglected by either. It stands for something in the 
analysis which every student must give of the material 
with which he is working, and that something has a 
value, sometimes great and sometimes small, which 
must influence the estimate of the material which both 
history and folklore supply in the unravelling of man’s 
past. 
I will now finally give a more complicated example 
of the folk-tale as illustrative of the connection be-

tween history and tradition. Mr. J. F. Campbell 
printed a tale in the second volume of the Zrans- 
actions of the Ethnological Society (p. 336), which 
had been sent to him in Gaelic by John Davan, in 
December, 1862—that is, after the publication of the 
fourth volume of his Highland Tales. The tale is 
only in outline, but in quite sufficient fulness for my 
present purpose, as follows :— 
There was a man at some time or other who was well 
off, and had many children. When the family grew 
up the man gave a well-stocked farm to each of his 
children. When the man was old his wife died, and he 
divided all that he had amongst his children, and lived 
with them, turn about, in their houses. The sons and 
daughters got tired of him and ungrateful, and tried to 
get rid of him when he came to stay with them. At 
last an old friend found him sitting tearful by the way- 
side, and learning the cause of his distress, took him 
home ; there he gave him a bowl of gold and a lesson 
which the old man learned and acted. When all the 
ungrateful sons and daughters had gone to a preach- 
ing, the old man went to a green knoll where his 
grandchildren were at play, and pretending to hide, he 
turned up a flat hearthstone in an old stance,' and 
went out of sight. He spread out his gold on a big 
stone in the sunlight, and he muttered, ‘‘Ye are 
mouldy, ye are hoary, ye will be better for the sun.” 
The grandchildren came sneaking over the knoll, and 
when they had seen and heard all that they were in-

concerns you not; touch it not,” said the grandfather ; 
and he swept his gold into a bag and took it home to 
his old friend. The grandchildren told what they had 
seen, and henceforth the children strove who should 
be kindest to the old grandfather. Still acting on the 
counsel of his sagacious old chum, he got a stout little 
black chest made, and carried it always with him. 
When any one questioned him as to its contents, his 
answer was, ‘‘ That will be known when the chest is 
opened.” When he died he was buried with great 
honour and ceremony, and then the chest was opened 
by the expectant heirs. In it were found broken pot- 
sherds and bits of slate, and a long-handled, white 
wooden mallet with this legend on its head :— 
“So am favioche fiorum, 
Thabhavit gnoc annsa cheann, 
Do n’fhear nach gleidh maoin da’ fein, 
Ach bheir a chuid go leir d’a chlann.” 
“ Here is the fair mall 
To give a knock on the skull 
To the man who keeps no gear for himself, 
But gives all to his bairns.” 
Wright, in his collection of Latin stories, published 
by the Percy Society in 1842 (pp. 28-29), gives a 
variant of this tale under the title of ‘‘De divite qui 
dedit omnia filio suo,” and, so far as can be judged 
by the abstract, the parallel between the two narratives, 
separated by at least five centuries of time, is remark- 
ably close. The latter part is apparently different, for 
the Latin version tells how the man pretended that the 
chest contained a sum of money, part of which was to 
be applied for the good of his soul, and the rest to 
dispose of as he pleased. But at the point of death

his children opened the chest. ‘‘ Antequam totaliter 
expiraret, ad cistam currentes nihil invenerunt nisi 
malleum, in quo Anglicé scriptum est :— 
‘* *Wyht suylc a betel be he smyten, 
That al the werld hyt mote wyten, 
That gyfht his sone al his thing, 
And goht hym self a beggyn.’” 
Here, then, is a case whereby to test the problem of 
the position of folk-tales as historical material. Did the 
people adopt this tale from literature into tradition and 
keep it alive for five centuries ; or did some early and 
unconscious folklorist adapt it into literature? The 
literary version has the flavour of its priestly influence, 
which does not appear in the traditional version ; and I 
make the preliminary observation that if literature could 
have so stamped itself upon the memory of the folk as 
to have preserved all the essentials of such a story as 
this, it must have been due to some academic influence 
(of which, however, there is no evidence), and this 
influence would have preserved a nearer likeness to 
literary forms than the peasant’s tale presents to us. 
But the objection to this theory is best shown by an 
analysis of the tale, and by some research into the 
possible sources of its origin. 
The story presents us with the following essential 
incidents :— 
1. The gift of a well-stocked farm by a father to each 
of his children. 
2. The surrender of all property during the owner’s 
lifetime. 
3. The living of the old father with each of his 
children.  
-P-A-G-E-98
    yo FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
4. The attempted killing of the old man. 
5. The mallet bearing the inscription. 
6. The rhyming formula of the inscription. 
Mr. Campbell notes the first and third of these inci- 
dents in his original abstract of the story,! but of the 
remaining second, fourth, fifth, and sixth no note has 
hitherto been taken. 
Of the first incident, the gift of a well-stocked farm 
by a father to each of his children, Mr. Campbell says: 
‘‘This subdivision of land by tenants is the dress and 
declaration put on bya class who now tell this tale.” 
But it alsé represents an ancient system of swarming 
off from the parent household when society was in a 
tribal stage. The incident of the tale is exactly repro- 
duced in local custom. In the island of Skye the 
possessor of a few acres of land cut them up only a few 
years ago into shreds and patches to afford a separate 
dwelling for each son and daughter who married.? In 
Kinross, in 1797, the same practice prevailed. ‘‘Among 
the feuars the parents are in many instances disposed 
to relinquish and give up to their children their landed 
possessions or the principal part of them, retaining 
only for themselves some paltry pendicle or patch of 
ground.”* In Ireland and in Cornwall much the 
same evidence is forthcoming, and elsewhere I have 
taken some pains to show that these local customs are 
the isolated survivals in late times of early tribal prac- 
tices.* 
We next turn to the second essential incident of the

tale—the surrender of the estate during the owner’s 
lifetime. This is a well-marked feature of early 
custom, and Du Chaillu has preserved something 
like the survival of the ritual observances connected 
with it in his account of the Scandinavian practice. 
On a visit to Husum he witnessed the ceremonial 
which attended the immemorial custom of the farm 
coming into possession of the eldest son, the father 
still being alive. The following is Mr. Du Chaillu’s 
description, and the details are important: ‘‘The 
dinner being ready, all the members of the family came 
in and seated themselves around the board, the father 
taking, as is customary, the head of the table. All at 
once, Roar, who was not seated, came to his father and 
said, ‘Father, you are getting old; let me take your 
place.’ ‘Oh, no, my son,’ was the answer, ‘I am not 
too old to work; it is not yet time: wait awhile.’ 
Then, with an entreating look, Roar said, ‘Oh, father, 
all your children and myself are often sorry to see you 
look so tired when the day’s labour is over: the work 
of the farm is too much for you; it is time for you to 
rest and do nothing. Rest in your old age. Oh, let 
me take your place at the head of the table.’ All the 
faces were now extremely sober, and tears were seen in 
many eyes. ‘Not yet, my son.’ ‘Oh, yes, father.’ 
Then said the whole family, ‘ Now it is time for you to 
rest.’ He rose, and Roar took his place, and was then 
the master. His father, henceforth, would have nothing 
to do, was to live in a comfortable house, and to 
receive yearly a stipulated amount of grain or flour, 
potatoes, milk, cheese, butter, meat, etc.”! Without 
1 Du Chaillu’s Land of the Midnight Sun, i. 393.

    72, FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
stopping to analyse this singular ceremony in detail, it 
is important to note that old age is the assigned cause 
of resignation by the father of his estate; that the 
ceremony is evidently based upon traditional forms, 
the meaning of which is not distinctly comprehended 
by the present performers; that the father is sup- 
ported by his successor. As a proof that we have 
here a survival of very ancient practice, it may be 
noticed that in Spiti, a part of the Punjab, an exact 
parallel occurs. There the father retires from the head- 
ship of the family when his eldest son is of full age, 
and has taken unto himself a wife ; on each estate there 
is a kind of dower-house with a plot of land attached, 
to which the father in these cases retires. In Bavaria 
and in Wiirtemberg the same custom obtains,” and the 
sagas of the North also confirm it as an ancient 
custom.® 
Of the third incident in the tale, the living of the 
father with his children, Mr. Campbell says this points 
to the old Highland cluster of houses and to the farm 
worked by several families in common,‘ and I think we 
have here the explanation why the father in Scotland 
did not have his ‘‘dower-house,” as he did in Scandi- 
navia and in Spiti. 
We next come to the fourth incident, the attempted 
killing of the old father. Now, from some of the 
earliest accounts of travels in Britain, we know that 
the death of the aged by violence was a signal element 
of the native customs. ‘‘They die only when they have

   HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 73 
lived long enough; for when the aged men have made 
good cheere and anoynted their bodies with sweet oint- 
ments they leape off a certain rocke into the sea.” 
That we have in this episode of the story, remains of 
customs which once existed in the North, Mr. Elton 
affords proof, both from saga-history and from the 
practice of later times, when ‘‘the Swedes and Pome- 
ranians killed their old people in the way which was 
indicated by the passage quoted above.”! It is the 
custom of many savage tribes, and the observances 
made use of are sometimes suggestive of the facts of 
the tale we are now analysing. Thus, among the 
Todas of the Nilgiri Hills, they place the old people in 
large earthen jars with some food, and leave them to 
perish;? while among the Hottentots, Kolben says, 
‘‘when persons become unable to perform the least 
office for themselves they are then placed in a soli- 
tary hut at a considerable distance, with a small 
stock of provisions within their reach, where they 
are left to die of hunger, or be devoured by the wild 
beasts.’ 
The important bearing of these incidents of barbar- 
ous and savage life upon our subject will be seen when 
we pass on to our fifth incident, namely, the significant 
use of the mallet. Some curious explanations have 
been given of this. Mr. Thoms once thought it might 
be identified with Malleus, the name of the Devil.‘ 
Nork has attempted with more reason to identify it

with the hammer of Thor.' But the real identification 
is closer than this. Thus, it is connected with the 
Valhalla practices, already noted, by the fact that if an 
old Norseman becomes too frail to travel to the cliff, in 
order to throw himself over, his kinsman would save 
him the disgrace of dying ‘‘like a cow in the straw,” 
and would beat him to death with the family club.? 
Mr. Elton, who quotes this passage, adds in a note 
that one of the family clubs is still preserved at a farm 
in East Gothland.* Aubrey has preserved an old Eng- 
lish ‘‘ countrie story ” of ‘‘the holy mawle, which (they 
fancy) hung behind the church dore, which, when the 
father was seaventie, the sonne might fetch to knock 
his father in the head, as effoete, & of no more use.” 
That Aubrey preserved a true tradition is proved by 
what we learn of similar practices elsewhere. Thus, in 
fifteenth-century MSS. of prose romances found in 
English and also in Welsh, Sir Perceval, in his adven- 
tures in quest of the Holy Grail, being at one time ill 
at ease, congratulates himself that he is not like those 
men of Wales, where sons pull their fathers out of bed 
and kill them to save the disgrace of their dying in 
bed.® Keysler cites several instances of this savage 
custom in Prussia, and a Count Schulenberg rescued 
an old man who was being beaten to death by his sons 
at a place called Jammerholz, or ‘‘ Woful Wood”; 
while a Countess of Nansfield, in the fourteenth 
century, is said to have saved the life of an old

man on the Liineberg Heath under similar circum- 
stances. 
Our investigation of barbarous and savage customs, 
which connect themselves with the essential incidents of 
this Highland tale, has at this point taken us outside the 
framework of the story. The old father in the tale was 
not killed by the mallet, but he is said to have used it 
as a warning to others to stop the practice of giving up 
their property during lifetime. We have already seen 
that this practice was an actual custom in early times, 
appearing in local survivals both in England and 
Scotland. Therefore the story must have arisen at a 
time when this practice was undergoing achange. We 
must note, too, that the whole story leads up to the 
finding of a mallet with the rhyming inscription written 
thereon, connecting it with the instrument of death to 
the aged, but only on certain conditions. If, then, we 
can find that the rhyming inscription on the mallet has 
an existence quite apart from the story, and if we can 
find that mallets bearing such an inscription do actually 
exist, we may fairly conclude that the story, which, in 
Scotland, is the vehicle of transmission of the rhyme, 
is of later origin than the rhyme itself. 
First of all, it is to be noted under this head that 
Wright, in a note to the Latin story we have already 
quoted, gives from John of Bromyard’s Summa Pre- 
dicantium another English version of the verse— 
“* Wit this betel the smieth 
And alle the worle thit wite 
That thevt the ungunde alle thing, 
And goht him selve a beggyng,” 
which shows, I think, the popularity of the verse in the
-P-A-G-E-104
  76 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
vernacular. Clearly, then, the Latin version is a 
translation of this, and not vice versa. It must have 
been a rhyming formula in the vernacular, which had a 
life of its own quite outside its adoption into literature. 
This inferential proof of the actual life of the English 
rhyming formula is confirmed by actual facts in the case 
of the corresponding German formula. Nork, in the 
volume I have already quoted, collects evidence from 
Grimm, Haupt, and others, which proves that sometimes 
in front of a house, as at Osnabriick, and sometimes at 
the city gate, as in several of the cities of Silesia and 
Saxony, there hangs a mallet with this inscription :— 
“Wer den kindern gibt das Brod 
Und selber dabei leidet Noth 
Den schlagt mit dieser keule todt ”— 
which Mr. Thoms has Englished thus :— 
‘‘Who to his children gives his bread 
And thereby himself suffers need, 
With this mallet strike him dead.”! 
These rhymes are the same as those in the Scottish 
tale and its Latin analogue, and that they are preserved 
on the selfsame instrument which is mentioned in the 
story as bearing the inscription is proof enough, I 
think, that the mallets and their rhyming formule are 
far older than the story. They are not mythical, the 
story is; their history is contained in the facts we have 
above detailed; the life of the folk-tale commences 
when the use or formula of the mallet ceases to be part 
of the social institutions. 
To the rhyming formula, then, I would trace the rise 
of the mythic tale told by the Highland peasant in 1862 
1 Gentleman's Magazine, 1850, i. 250-252.
-P-A-G-E-105
  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 77 
to Mr. J. F. Campbell. The old customs which we 
have detailed as the true origin of the mallet, and its 
hideous use in killing the aged and infirm, had died out, 
but the symbol of them remained. To explain the 
symbol a myth was created, which kept sufficiently 
near to the original idea as to retain evidence of its. 
close connection with the descent of property ; and thus 
was launched the dateless, impersonal, unlocalised story 
which Mr. Campbell has given as a specimen of vagrant 
traditions, which ‘‘must have been invented after 
agriculture and fixed habitations, after laws of property 
and inheritance ; but it may be as old as the lake- 
dwellings of Switzerland, or Egyptian civilisation, or 
Adam, whose sons tilled the earth.” I would venture 
to rewrite the last clause of this dictum of the great 
master of folk-tales, and I would suggest that the 
story, whatever its age as a story, tells us of facts in 
the life of its earliest narrators which do not belong to 
Teutonic or Celtic history. The Teuton and the Celt, 
with their traditional reverence for parental authority, 
at once patriarchal and priestly, would retain, with 
singular clearness, the memory of traditions, or it may 
be observations, of an altogether different set of ideas 
which belonged to the race with which they first came 
into contact. But whether the story is a mythic inter- 
pretation by Celts of pre-Celtic practices, or a pre- 
Celtic tradition, varied as soon as it became the 
property of the Celt to suit Celtic ideas, it clearly takes 
us back to practices very remote, to use Mr. Elton’s 
forcible words, from the reverence for the parents’ 
authority which might have perhaps been expected 
1 Journ, Ethnol. Soc., ii. 337+ 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  78 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
from descendants of ‘‘the Aryan household.”! These 
practices lead us back toa period of savagery, of which 
we have to speak in terms of race distinction if we 
would get at its root.2. The importance of such a con- 
clusion cannot be overrated, for it leads directly to the 
issue which must be raised whenever an investigation 
of tradition leaves us with materials, which are promptly 
rejected as fragments of Celtic history because they are 
too savage, but which need not therefore be rejected as 
history, because they may be referred further back than 
Celtic history. 
If we proceed by more drastic methods, by the methods 
of statistics, we shall arrive at much the same con- 
clusion.’ Taking the first twelve stories in Grimm’s 
great collection, we find that seven of them yield 
elements which we are entitled to call savage, because 
1 Elton's Origins, 92. 
2 Mr. Jacobs (Folklore, i. 405) objected to my interpretation of this 
story because—first, the Latin rhyme appearing in the Gaelic tale, the 
twelfth-century Latin story and the German inscription ‘‘ tell for the 
origination of the story in one single place in historic times”; and, 
secondly, because a Kashmir story (Knowles’ Folk-tales of Kashmir, 241), 
based on the same main incident, omits the minor incident of the mallet 
altogether. The answer to the first objection is that the Latin rhyme has 
been attached, in historic times, to the ancient folk-tale; and to the 
second objection, that the Kashmir story preserves the main incident 
of surrender of property upon reaching old age, and omits the more 
savage incident of killing, because the Kashmir people are in a stage of 
culture which still allowed of the surrender of property, but, like the 
Scandinavians, did not allow of the killing of the aged. Similarly, an 
English parallel to this form of the variant is preserved by De la Pryme 
in his Diary (Surtees Society), 162. It must be remembered that the 
Kashmiris occupy a land which is referred to by Herodotos (iii. 99-105) 
as in the possession of people who killed their aged (cf Latham, 
Ethnology of India, 199); and if my reading of the evidence is correct, 
this is also the case of the Highland peasant.

they are so far removed from the European culture 
amidst which the folk-tales have lived, and because these 
elements belong not to the accidentals of the stories but 
to the essentials. Thus, if we divide the folk-tale into 
its components, we shall find that it consists of three 
features :— 
1. The story radicals, or essential plot ; 
2. The story accidentals, or illustrative points ; 
3- Modern gloss upon the events in the story— 
and if we go on to allocate the various incidents of 
the stories to these three heads, we get the following

There are thus savage elements in seven out of 
twelve stories, and the question becomes an important 
one as to how this is. They are the stories of the 
nursery, told by mothers to children, stories kept alive 
by tradition, and the only possible answer to our 
question is that they contain fragments of the early 
culture-history of the ancestors, or at all events the 
predecessors, of those who have preserved them for our 
use. An occasional savage incident might have been 
considered a freak of the original narrator, or a bor- 
rowing by one of the countless late narrators of these 
stories brought home from savage countries; but 
statistics disprove both of these suppositions. It is not 
accidental but persistent savagery we meet with in 
the folk-tale. It is also the savagery to be found 
amongst modern peoples still in the savage stage of 
culture. 
This is proved in a very complete manner by Mr. 
MacCulloch, whose study provides the material for a 
statistical survey of story incidents founded on primi- 
tive custom and belief! They are the most ancient 
history to which we have access. That this history is 
contained in the folk-tales of modern peasantry shows 
it to have come from that far-off period which saw the 
earliest condition of these people. It is still history, if 
it tells us of a life which preceded the written record. 
It is history of the most valuable description, for it 
is to be found nowhere else as relating to the remotest 
period of European civilisation. The modern savage

is better off in this respect. He has an outside historian 
in the traveller and the anthropologist of modern days. 
The savage who was ancestor to our own people had 
no such means of becoming known to history, or had 
but very limited means, and it is only in the deathless 
tradition that we can trace him out. 
These conclusions have been drawn from that great 
class of tradition preserved by historic peoples in 
historic times, and yet unmistakably pointing to pre- 
historic culture. We have been able to show the 
methods to be adopted for, and the results of, dis- 
engaging the myth which has gravitated to the 
historic person or place from the historic facts which 
have become part of the legend, and to trace out in the 
folk-tale facts which belong to a culture far removed 
from civilised life. There are thus revealed two 
distinct centres of influence, the traditional centre and 
the historic centre, and it is obvious that the question 
must be asked—which is the more important? It seems 
to me equally obvious that the answer must be given in 
favour of the historic. History is indebted to tradition 
for preserving some of the most remote facts of racial 
or national life, which but for tradition would have 
been lost, and if we are content to use this tradition 
as a storehouse from which we may provide ourselves 
with ancient historical documents, we can trace out 
therefrom points in the history of any given country 
wherever the traditions have been preserved. 
The folk-tale, in point of fact, equally with the personal 
and local legend, comes into close contact with history. 
The periods of history in the folk-tales are different from 
hose in the legends, but together these periods reach

from prehistoric culture to historic event. We cannot, 
however, call this extent of time a continuous period, 
and we cannot point to definite stages within the 
detached periods. Much more research must be accom- 
plished before it will be possible to claim such results 
as these. I have indicated some points of difficulty, 
some methods of treatment which appear to me to be 
wrong, and to which I shall have again to refer later on ; 
but in the meantime, from the necessarily incomplete 
evidence which I have been able to produce, it is, I 
think, abundantly clear that folklore has to be studied 
from its historical surroundings if we would draw from 
it all that it is capable of telling.

In the meantime it is well to bear in mind that there 
is one important department of history which has 
always been frankly and unhesitatingly accepted as 
history and yet which has no stronger foundation than 
tradition, and tradition of the most formal kind. I 
allude to the early laws of most of the peoples who 
have become possessed of an historic civilisation. 
These laws have all been preserved by tradition, are in 
rhyme or rhythm in order to assist the memory, have 
become the sacred repository of a school or class of 
priests, and have finally been reduced to writing by a 
great lawgiver, who by the act of giving the people 
written laws has had attributed to him supernatural 
origin and powers. That history should have accepted 
from tradition such an important section of its material 
is worth consideration by itself, apart from its bearing

on the present study, and I shall proceed, therefore, to 
set out some of the chief facts in this connection. 
There can be no doubt that in the tribal society of 
Indo-European peoples the laws and rules which 
governed the various members of the tribe were deemed 
to be sacred and were preserved by tradition. The 
opening clauses of the celebrated Laws of Manu illus- 
trate this position. ‘‘The great sages approached 
Manu, who was seated with a collected mind, and 
having worshipped him spoke as follows: Deign, divine 
one, to declare to us precisely and in due order the 
sacred laws of each of the four chief castes and of the 
intermediate ones. For thou, O Lord, alone knowest 
the purport, the rites, and the knowledge of the soul 
taught in this whole ordinance of the self-existent 
which is unknowable and unfathomable.”!_ They were 
not only sacred in origin but they dealt with sacred 
things, and Sir Henry Maine has drawn the broad 
conclusion that ‘‘there is no system of recorded law, 
literally from China to Peru, which, when it first 
emerges into notice, is not seen to be entangled with 
religious ritual and observance.” In Greece the law- 
givers were supposed to be divinely inspired, Minds 
from Jupiter, Lykurgos from the Delphic god, 
Zaleukos from Pallas? The earliest notions of law 
are connected with Themis the Goddess of Justice.* In 
1 Bihler, Laws of Manu, i. : ‘‘In Vedic mythology Manu is the heros 
eponymos of the human race and by his nature belongs both to gods 
and to men” (p. 57). Cf Burnell and Hopkins, Ordinances of Manu,

Rome it is to Romulus himself that is attributed the 
first positive law, and it is by a college of priests that 
the laws were preserved.!. In Scandinavia the laws 
were in the custody and charge of the temple priests, 
and the accumulated evidence for the sacred origin 
and connection of the laws is to be found in the sagas.” 
Among the Celtic peoples it is well known that the 
laws were preserved and administered by the Brehons, 
who are compared with the Hindu Brahmins by Sir 
Henry Maine, ‘‘with many of their characteristics 
altered, and indeed, their whole sacerdotal authority 
abstracted by the influence of Christianity.”* In the 
Isle of Man the laws were deemed sacred and known 
only to the Deemsters.* 
In all cases laws were preserved by tradition and not 
by writing and evidence, and the superior value 
attached to the traditional record appears everywhere. 
The oldest record of Hindu law agrees with the best 
authority that it was not founded on writing but 
‘‘upon immemorial customs which existed prior to and 
independent of Brahminism.”® In Greece the very 
nature of the ¢hemzstes shows that they were judgments 
dependent upon traditional custom. In Rome it is the 
subject of definite research that the ‘‘ greater part of 
Roman law was founded on the mores majorum.”® In 
Scandinavia the law speaker was obliged to recite the

whole law within the period to which the tenure of his 
office was limited.1_ The Celtic laws are based upon 
customs handed down from remote antiquity,” and late 
down in English law it was admitted as a principle 
that if oral declarations came into conflict with 
written instruments the former had the more binding 
authority.® 
One of the means by which this sacred tradition was 
preserved was through the medium of rhythm and 
verse. Thus, as Sir Henry Maine explains, 
‘« The law book of Manu is in verse, and verse is one of 
the expedients for lessening the burden which the memory 
has to bear when writing is unknown or very little used. But 
there is another expedient which serves the same object. 
This is Aphorism or Proverb. Even now in our own country 
much of popular wisdom is preserved either in old rhymes or 
in old proverbs, and it is well ascertained that during the 
middle ages much of law, and not a little of medicine, was pre- 
served among professions, not necessarily clerkly, by these 
two agencies,” #

Manu, pp. xx, xxxi. It is worth while quoting here the following in- 
teresting note from a letter from the Marquis di Spineto printed in 
Clarke’s Travels, viii. 417 :— 
‘‘From the most remote antiquity men joined together, and wishing 
either to amuse themselves or to celebrate the praises of their gods sang 
short poems to a fixed tune, Indeed, generally speaking, the Jaws by 
which they were governed, the events which had made the greatest 
impression on their minds, the praises which they bestowed upon their 
gods or on their heroes were all sung long before they were written, and 
I need not mention that according to Aristotle this is the reason why the 
Greeks gave the same appellation to laws and to songs.”
-P-A-G-E-116
  88 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
In Greece the same word, yduos, was used for custom 
and law as for song. The prpa (declared law) of 
Sparta and Taras was in verse; the laws of Charondas 
were sung as oxd\ra at Athens,! and Strabo refers to the 
Mazacenes of Cappadocia as using the laws of Charon- 
das and appointing some person to be their law-singer 
(vouw0s0s), who is among them the declarer of the laws.? 
Sir Francis Palgrave, noticing the same character- 
istic of Teutonic law, says :— 
‘It cannot be ascertained that any of the Teutonic nations 
reduced their customs into writing, until the influence of in- 
creasing civilisation rendered it expedient to depart from their 
primeval usages; but an aid to the recollection was often 
afforded as amongst the Britons, by poetry or by the conden- 
sation of the maxim or principle in proverbial or antithetical 
sentences like the Cymric triads. The marked alliteration of 
the Anglo-Saxon laws is to be referred to the same cause, 
and in the Frisic laws several passages are evidently written 
in verse. From hence, also, may originate those quaint and 
pithy rhymes in which the doctrines of the law of the old 
time are not unfrequently recorded.” * 
Again, the editors of the Brehon Law Tracts point 
out that early laws are handed down ‘in a rhythmical 
form; always in language condensed and antiquated 
they assume the character of abrupt and sententious pro- 
verbs. Collections of such sayings are found scattered 
throughout the Brehon Law Tracts.”* The sagas con- 
1 The references are all given in Smith's Dict. of Greek and Roman 
Antiquities sub vipos. Aristotle in the Problems, 19, 28, definitely says, 
“Before the use of letters men sang their laws that they might not forget 
them, as the custom continues yet among the Agathyrsoi.”

tain many verses which partake of the character of 
legal formule, and in Beowulf there seems to be a 
definite example. It occurs in the passage describing 
Beowulf engaged in his fatal combat with the fiery 
dragon, when his ‘‘companions,” stricken with terror, 
deserted him, on which Wiglaf pronounced the follow- 
ing malediction :— 
‘© Now shall the service of treasure, 
and the gifts of swords, 
all joy of paternal inheritance, 
all support 
of all your kin depart ; 
every one of your family 
must go about 
deprived of his rights 
of citizenship ; 
when far and wide 
the nobles shall learn 
your flight, 
your dishonourable deed. 
Death is better 
to every warrior 
than disgraced life.” 
Mr. Kemble remarks on this passage, that it is not 
improbable that the whole denunciation is a judicial 
formula, such as we know early existed, and in regular 
rhythmical measure.! 
These early examples may be followed up by others 
preserved to modern times. The most significant of 
these occurs in the Church ceremony of marriage, which 
preserves in the vernacular the ancient rhythmical 
formula of the marriage laws, and the antiquity of 
1 Hampson’s Origines Patricie, 106-107 ; Kemble, line 5763 et seq.  
-P-A-G-E-118
  go FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
the Church ritual is proved from the fact that it is ac- 
companied and enforced by the old rhythmical verse, 
which is indicative of early legal or ceremonious usage. 
‘‘ With this rynge I the wed 
And this gold and silver I the geve, 
and with my body I the worshipe, 
and with all my worldely cathel I the endowe.”! 
Sir Francis Palgrave has noticed the subject, and 
points out that the wife is taken 
“to have and to hold? 
from this day forward 
for better, for worse, 
for richer, for poorer,® 
in sickness and in health, 
to love and to cherish, 
till death us do part 
and thereto I plight thee my troth.” 
These words are inserted in our service according to 
the ancient canon of England, and even when the Latin 
mass was sung by the tonsured priest, the promises 
which accompany the delivery of the symbolical pledge 
of union were repeated by the blushing bride in a more 
intelligible tongue.‘ This is a curious and significant 
fact, and as we trace out these rhythmical lines farther 
back in their original vernacular, the more clearly 
1 Proctor’s History of the Book of Common Prayer, p. 410. 
2 Hist. Eng. Commonwealth, ii. p. cxxxvi. Littleton points out the 
legal antiquity and importance of these words: ‘‘no conveyance can be 
made without them.” See Wheatley’s Book of Common Prayer (quoting 
Littleton), p. 406.

distinct is their archaic nature. According to the usage 
of Salisbury the bride answered :— 
‘*T take thee, John, 
to be my wedded husband, 
to have and to hold 
fro’ this day forward 
for better, for worse, 
for richer, for poorer, 
in sycknesse, in hele, 
to be bonere and buxom [obedient] 
in bedde and at borde 
till death do us part 
and thereto I plight thee my trothe.”? 
The Welsh manual in the library of the Dean and 
Chapter of Hereford has a slight variation in the form, 
and an older spelling :— 
“Ich N. take thee N. 
to my weddid wyf, 
for fayroure for foulore, 
for ricchere for porer, 
for betere for wers, 
in sicknesse and in helthe, 
forte deth us departe, 
and only to the holde 
and tharto ich plygtte my treuthe.”? 
To this may be added the many local examples of 
the preservation of laws or legal formule by means of 
their form in verse. The most interesting of these, 
perhaps, is that by which the Kentishman redeemed his

land from the lord by repeating, as it was said, in the 
language of his ancestors :— 
“Nighon sithe yeld 
And nighon sithe geld, 
And vif pund for the were, 
Ere he become healdere.” 
The first verse, 
“Dog draw 
Stable stand 
Back berend 
And bloody hand” 
justified the verderer in his punishment of the of- 
fender. In King Athelstane’s grant to the good 
men of Beverley, and inscribed beneath his effigy 
in the Minster, 
“Als fre 
Mak I the 
As heart may think 
Or eigh may see,” 
we have perhaps the ancient form of manumission or 
enfranchisement,' just as we have the surrender by a 
freeman who gave up his liberty by putting himself 
under the protection of a master, and becoming his 
man, still preserved among children, when one of them 
takes hold of the foretop of another and says :— 
“‘Tappie, tappie, tousie, will ye be my man?”’? 
All over the country we meet with these rhyming or 
rhythmical formulz which have legal signifiance. “In 
the north the chief of the Macdonalds gave grants in 
the following form :— 
‘*T, Donald, chief of the Macdonalds, give here, in my

Am shuidh air Dun Donuill, 
Toirt coir do Mhac-aigh air Kilmahumaig, 
O’n diugh gus a maireach 
’S gu la bhrath mar sin.’’? 
At Scarborough there is an old proverbial saying 
as to ‘Scarborough Warning,” which has had various 
accounts given of its origin,® but the true explanation 
of which is that it is the fragment of an ancient legal 
formula of the kind we are investigating. Abraham 
De la Pryme describes it in his seventeenth-century 
diary as follows :— 
“‘Scarburg Warning is a proverb in many places of the 
north, signifying any sudden warning given upon any 
account. Some think it arose from the sudden comeing 
of an enemy against the castle there, and haveing dis- 
chargd a broad side, then commands them to surrender. 
Others think that the proverb had it’s original from other 
things, but all varys. However, this is the true origin 
thereof. 
‘“‘The town is a corporation town, and tho’ it is very poor 
now to what it was formerly, yet it hasa...... who is 
commonly some poor man, they haveing no rich ones amongst 
them. About two days before Michilmass day the sayd

lord mare of London) all along the shore side, they make 
many halts, and the cryer crys thus with a strange sort of a 
singing voyce, high and low :— 
“¢Whay! Whay! Whay! 
Pay your gavelage, ha! 
Between this and Michaelmas Day, 
Or you'll be fined I, say!’ 
‘‘Then the fiddlers begins to dance, and caper and plays, 
fit to make one burst with laughter that sees and hears 
them, Then they go on again and crys as before, with the 
greatest majesty and gravity immaginable, none of this 
comical crew being seen so much as to smile all the time, 
when as spectators are almost bursten with laughing. This 
is the true origin of the proverb, for this custome of gavel- 
age is a certain tribute that every house pays to the 
NS eee when he is pleased to call for it, and he gives 
not above one day warning, and may call for it when he 
pleases.” ! 
Rhyming tenures have been frequently noted but 
never understood. They occur in many parts of the 
country. The tithingman of Combe Keynes, in 
Dorsetshire, is obliged to do suit at Winforth Court, 
and after repeating the following incoherent lines, 
pays threepence and goes away without saying another 
word :—

It is hardly necessary to quote more examples. 
They are not unknown to the historian, but because 
they are in rhyme they have been hastily assumed to 
be spurious or even burlesque.? But the evidence of a 
rhyming formula is the opposite to this. It is evidence 
of their genuineness, and if some of the words appear 
to be nonsensical it is due to the fact that the sense of 
the old formula has been misunderstood, and has then 
become gradually altered. 
All these rhyming tenures, indeed, find their place 
among the traditional examples of legal formulz. 
1 Hazlitt, Tenures of Land, 80; other examples refer to the Hundred 
of Cholmer and Dancing, in Essex, 75; to Kilmersdon, in Somerset- 
shire, 182; to Hopton, in Salop, 165. John of Gaunt is responsible for 
many of these curious and interesting remains of tribal antiquity. 
Bisley's Handbook of North Devon, 28, refers to one relating to the 
manor of Umberleigh, near Barnstaple, and I have a note from Mr. 
Edmund Wrigglesworth, of Hull, of a parallel to this being preserved 
by tradition only. There is a tradition respecting the estate of Sutton 
Park, near Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, which states that it formerly 
belonged to John of Gaunt, who gave it to an ancestor of the present 
proprietor, one Roger Burgoyne, by the following grant :— 
“T, John of Gaunt, 
Do give and do grant, 
To Roger Burgoyne 
And the heirs of his loin 
Both Sutton and Potton 
Until the world’s rotten.” 
Potton was a neighbouring village to Sutton. There is a moated site 
in the park called ‘“‘John o’ Gaunt’s Castle,” see Notes and Queries, 
tenth series, vi. 466. Cf Aubrey, Collections for Wilts, 185, for an ex- 
ample at Midgehall; Cowell’s Law Interpreter, 1607, and the Diction- 
arum Rusticum, 1704, for the custom of East and West Enborn, in 
Berks, which was made famous by Addison’s Spectator in 1714.

They are the local offshoots preserved because of their 
legal significance, preserved by those interested from 
their legal side. Because they are not preserved in the 
formal codes they need not be neglected, and they 
must not be misunderstood. They are not to be put 
on one side by the historian as freaks of local land- 
owners. They are real descendants by traditional 
lines from the times when laws were not written, but 
kept alive in the memory by means of such assistance 
as rhyme could supply, and from the tribesmen who 
thus treasured the law they obeyed.? 
That this branch of recorded law is not only early 
but tribal is undoubted, but perhaps it will be well to 
refer to tribal rhyming formule of an independent 
kind in order to show by parallel evidence the tribal 
characteristics. ‘In 1884 Mr. Posnett drew attention to 
this important subject, and noted that 
“‘Dr. Brown, in an attempt to sketch the origin of poetry— 
an attempt which attracted the attention of Bishop Percy in 
his remarks introductory to the Religues—proposed more 
than one hundred years ago to discover the source of the 
combined dance, song, melody, and mimetic action of 
primitive compositions in the common festivals of clan life.

was personal, upon localities, Nottingham is divided into two parts, 
one having primogeniture and the other junior right as the rule of 
descent. Southampton and Exeter have also local divisions. But 
perhaps the most striking example is at Breslau, where there co-existed, 
until 1st January, 1840, five different particular laws and observances 
in regard to succession, the property of spouses, etc., the application of 
which was limited to certain territorial jurisdictions ; not unfrequently 
the law varied from house to house, and it even happened that one house 
was situated on the borders of different laws, to each of which, there- 
fore, it belonged in part ; Savigny, Private Int. Law, cap. i. sect. iv.

Dr. Brown’s theory as a curious anticipation of the historical 
method in a study which, in spite of M. Taine’s efforts, has 
made so little progress as yet. The clan ethic of inherited 
guilt and vicarious punishment has attracted considerable 
attention. But the clan poetry of the ancient Arabs and of 
the bard-clans, surviving in the Hebrew sons of Asaph or the 
Greek Homeride, has not received that light from compara- 
tive inquiry which the closely connected problems of primi- 
tive music and metre would alone amply deserve.” + 
Not much has been done since this was penned. Max 
Miiller had previously, in 1847, declared that the Rig 
Veda consisted of the clan songs of the Hindu people,” 
but the importance of such a conclusion has been 
entirely neglected. In the meantime evidence is accu- 
mulating that in Britain there are still preserved many 
examples of clan songs. Thus Lord Archibald Camp- 
bell has published, in the first volume of his Wazfs and 
Strays of Celtic Tradition, some sixteen or seventeen 
sagas. Some of these are clan-traditions; and the 
editor notes as evidence of their antiquity the fact 
that none of them makes any mention of firearms. 
These clan-traditions all relate to feuds and vendettas ; 
and in one case it is expressly recorded that the de- 
scendants of one of the foes of the clan, in their account 
of the incident narrated, ‘‘altered this tradition and 
reversed the main facts.” This has been followed by a 
volume definitely devoted to ‘‘clan-traditions,”* while 
in the Carmina Gadelica and many of the Highland 
incantations there are preserved specimens of ancient 
clan songs.

The most interesting of the tribal songs is that pre- 
served at the Hawick Common riding. The burgh 
officers form the van of a pageant which insensibly 
carries us back to ancient times, and in some verses 
sung on the occasion there is a refrain which has been 
known for ages as the slogan of Hawick. It is ‘‘ Teri- 
bus ye teri Odin,” which is probably a corruption of 
the Anglo-Saxon, ‘‘Tyr habbe us, ye Tyr ye Odin ”— 
May Tyr uphold us, both Tyr and Odin. 
Fortunately Dr. Murray has investigated this for- 
mula, and I will quote what he says :— 
       
         
    
                            
    “‘A relic of North Anglian heathendom seems to be pre- 
served in a phrase which forms the local slogan of the town 
of Hawick, and which, as the name of a peculiar local air, and 
the refrain, or ‘owerword’ of associated ballads, has been 
connected with the history of the town back to ‘fable-shaded 
eras.’ Different words have been sung to the tune from 
time to time, and none of those now extant can lay claim to 
any antiquity ; but associated with all, and yet identified with 
none, the refrain ‘Tyr-zbus ye Tyr ye Odin,’ Tyr heb us, ye 
Tyr ye Odin! Tyr keep us, both Tyr and Odin! (by which 
name the tune also is known) appears to have come down, 
scarcely mutilated, from the time when it was the burthen of 
the song of the gled-mann or scald, or the invocation of a 
heathen Angle warrior, before the northern Hercules and the 
blood-red lord of battles had yielded to the ‘pale god’ of the 
Christians.” 
And in a note Dr. Murray adds :— 
“The ballad now connected with the air of ‘Tyribus’ com- 
memorates the laurels gained by the Hawick youth at and 
after the disastrous battle, when, in the words of the writer, 
“Our sires roused by ‘‘ Tyr ye Odin,” 
Marched and joined their king at Flodden,’

Annually since that event the ‘Common-Riding’ has been 
held, on which occasion a flag or ‘colour’ captured from a 
party of the English has been with great ceremony borne by 
mounted riders round the bounds of the common land, granted 
after Flodden to the burgh ; part of the ceremony consisting 
in a mock capture of the ‘colour’ and hot pursuit by a large 
party of horsemen accoutred for the occasion. At the con- 
clusion ‘Tyribus’ is sung, with all the honours, by the actors 
in the ceremony, from the roof of the oldest house in the 
burgh, the general population filling the street below, and 
joining in the song with immense enthusiasm. The influence 
of modern ideas is gradually doing away with much of the 
parade and renown of the Common-Riding. But ‘Tyr-ibus 
ye Tyr ye Odin’ retains all its local power to fire the lieges, 
and the accredited method of arousing the burghers to any 
political or civil struggle is still to send round the drums and 
fifes, ‘to play Tyribus’ through the town, a summons ana- 
logous to that of the Fiery Cross in olden times. Apart from 
the words of the slogan, the air itself bears in its wild fire all 
the tokens of a remote origin.” } 
We could not get better evidence than this of the sur- 
vival of tribal custom, custom that is distinctly connected 
with tribes rather than with places or individuals, with 
groups of people who, now bound together by local 
considerations and influences, have only recently passed 
away from the far more ancient influences of the tribe. 
Alike in the forms of historical codes and in traditional 
local remains, we have found evidence of the use of 
rhyme for the preservation of unwritten rules and 
forms ; and this use restores to tradition an important 
branch of its material.

    too FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
We have thus ascertained that there is direct and ac- 
knowledged indebtedness of history to tradition. Its 
extent covers a wide area of culture progress, and of 
unbroken continuity from tribal to historic times. The 
legal codes of the barbaric tribes of Western Europe 
are the direct successors of the traditional originals ; 
and because these legal codes, equally with their un- 
written predecessors, cannot be dispensed with by the 
historian, they find their place unquestioned among 
genuine historical material, They are no more, and 
no less, historical than other traditional material. They 
are part of the life of the people rescued from prehistoric 
days, and they tell us of these days by the same sanc- 
tion and the same methods as the rest of the traditional 
material which has been so strangely and so persistently 
neglected by the historian. The whole of tradition, and 
not selected parts of it, must be brought into use if we 
would follow scientific method, and I claim this for the 
study of folklore on the strength of the results which 
have now been brought together.

Here, however, we are close up to an important 
point of controversy. The mythologists claim tradi- 
tion as theirs. It does not, they assert, give us the 
history but-the mythology of our race. It tells us not 
of the men but of the gods. In explaining how this 
comes about, however, they have fallen into errors 
which it is not only necessary to correct but which 
are fundamental in their effects. We shall be better 
able later on to discuss the extremely important
-P-A-G-E-133
  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 101 
question of the position of the prehistoric tradition 
amidst historic life and surroundings, if we try to 
understand what the mythologists have done and not 
done in their attempts to claim exclusive property in 
the folk-tale. They have entirely denied or ignored all 
history contained in the folk-tale, and they have 
proceeded upon the assumption, the bald assumption 
not accompanied by any kind of proof, that the folk- 
tale contains nothing but the remnants of a once 
prevalent system of mythology. They ignore all the 
proofs brought forward by folklorists to the contrary, 
such proofs, for instance, as Mr. Knowles, Sir Richard 
Temple and others have produced concerning the 
Hindu folk-tale. What is not true of the Hindu folk- 
tale cannot be true of its Celtic or Teutonic or Scandi- 
navian parallel, and yet in the most recent study of 
Celtic tradition, Mr. Squire takes its mythic origin 
for granted, and works. through his ingenious state- 
ment without let or hindrance from other points of 
view. But even his thorough-going methods compel 
him to stop short at certain points, and to admit that he 
has come across historic fact. Thus he agrees that the 
Fir-Bolgs ‘‘ were not really gods but the pre-Aryan race 
which the Gaels, when they landed in Ireland, found 
already in occupation,”! and yet when he treats 
of the fight of the Fir-Bolgs with the Tuatha dé 
Danann, and is confronted with Sir William Wilde’s 
proofs that the monuments on the plain of Moy- 
tura are in agreement with the traditions concerning 
them, and point to the account of the battle being

tainly the coincidences are curious.” He disposes of 
1 Wilde, Lough Corrib, 210-248, Sir William Wilde has studied the 
details of this great fight with great care, and it is impossible to ignore 
his evidence as to the monuments of it being extant to this day among 
the recorded antiquities of Ireland, The battle lasted four days. The 
first day the Fir-Bolg had the best of the fighting, and pillar-stones 
erected to the heroes who fell are still in situ. Clogh-Fadha-Cunga, or 
long stone of Cong, which stood on the old road to the east of that 
village and a portion of which, six feet long, is still in an adjoining wall, 
being erected to Adleo of the Dananians, and Clogh-Fadha-Neal, or 
long stone of the Neale, at the junction of the roads passing northwards 
from Cross and Cong, commemorating the place where the king stood 
during the battle. After the battle each Fir-Bolg carried with him a 
stone and the head of a Danann to their king who erected a great cairn 
to commemorate the event, and this must be the cairn of Ballymagibbon 
which stands on the road passing from Cong to Cross. The well of 
Mean Uisge is identified as that mentioned in the MS. accounts of the 
battle, connected with a striking incident. After a careful examination 
of the locality, says Sir William Wilde, with a transcript of the ancient 
MS, in his hand, he was convinced of the identity of a stone heap 
standing within a circle as the place where the body of the loyal Fir- 
Bolg youth was burned. The second day’s battle surged northwards, 
and at the western shores of Lough Mask, Slainge Finn, the king’s 
son, pursuing the two sons of Cailchu and their followers, slew them 
there, and ‘seventeen flag stones were stuck in the ground in com- 
memoration of their death,” and by the margin of the lake in the island 
of Inish-Eogan there stands this remarkable monument to this hour. 
“The line of the Fir-Bolg camp can still be traced with wonderful accuracy. 
Caher-Speenan, the thorny fort, was a part of this camp, and still 
exists. More to the south-east, on the hill of Tongegee, are the remains 
of Caher-na-gree, the pleasant fort, and still further to the east are 
Lisheen, or little earthen fort, and Caher-Phetre, pewter fort. Other 
forts also exist to give evidence both of the Fir-Bolg and the Danann 
lines. The Danann monuments are situate in the fields opposite the 
glebes of Nymphsfield. Five remarkable stone circles still remain 
within the compass of a square mile, and there are traces of others. 
The Fir-Bolgs were defeated on the fourth day and their king Eochy 
fell fighting to the last. ‘A lofty cairn was raised over his body, 
and called Carn Eathach, from his name.” On the grassy hill of 
Killower, or Carn, overlooking Lough Mask, stands to this hour the 
most remarkable cairn in the west of Ireland, and there is little doubt 
this is the one referred to in the ancient tradition as commemorating the 
death of the last Fir-Bolg king in Erin,

them on the ground that the ‘‘ people of the goddess 
Danu are too obviously mythical to make it worth while 
to seek any standing ground for them in the world of 
reality.” That standing ground might be found con- 
nected with the Tuatha dé Danann in many places, but 
Mr. Squire will have it that it is impossible, because ‘‘it 
was about this period that the mythology of Ireland 
was being rewoven into spurious history.”! It is not, 
however, upon the mistakes of other inquirers? that 
the mythologists may rest a good claim for their own 
view. The Historza Britonum of Geoffrey of Mon- 
mouth disposes of neither the myths nor the history of 
the Celts. It shows myth in its secondary position, in 
the handling of those who would make it all history, 
just as now there are scholars who would make it all 
myth. In front of the legends attaching to persons 
and places is the history of these persons and places. 
Behind these legends lies the domain of the unattached 
and primitive folk-tale, Mr. Campbell’s Highland Tales, 
Kennedy’s Fireside Stories of Ireland, and those English 
tales which have been rescued by Mr. Clodd and 
others. This makes it impossible to see in the hero- 
legends naught else than the intangible realm of Celtic 
gods and goddesses. 
Equally impossible is it to create for them a home in 
a system of ‘‘state religion,” and yet a state religion 
is a necessary part of the evidence for mythological 
origins.’ There was no Celtic state. Emphatically this 
was so. Everything we know about the Celts of 
Britain, both before and after the Roman conquest, both

  104 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
in Britain, where the Roman power was upheld for four 
centuries, and in Ireland, where the Roman power never 
penetrated, the Celts were possessed of a tribal, not a 
state polity ; lived in tribal strongholds, not in Celtic 
cities ; occupied tribal territories, not countries formed 
into states; elected tribal chiefs in primitive fashion, 
and not kings with state ceremonial; and when they 
come under the dominion of an incipient state policy 
after the conquest of the English and the Northmen, 
their laws are promulgated and codified, and show that 
both Welsh and Irish codes are tribal, not state law. 
Not only do I fail to discover a state religion of the 
Celts, but I do not find it amongthe Teutons. There is 
greater evidence of discrepancies than of agreement in 
all the European religions, but these have not been 
dwelt upon by scholars. Professor York Powell, in 
ohe of his illuminating studies on Teutonic heathen- 
dom, is the only authority I know of who argues 
against the idea of a systematised religion. ‘‘It is 
important that we should at once throw aside the 
idea that there was any system, any organized pan- 
theon in the religion of these peoples. Their tribes 
were small and isolated, and each had its own peculiar 
gods and observances, although the mould of each 
faith was somewhat similar. Hence there were varieties 
of religious customs among the Goths, Swedes, Saxons, 
and Angles.” 
Now if there was no state there could be no state 
religion. What existed of worship and religion 
was tribal. These are the historical facts, which 
have been neglected by students of myth and saga.

I shall have to point out in greater detail presently 
what these tribal conditions mean to studies in folklore, 
but the word of warning and protest must come here, 
for it is unconsciously the conception of a Celtic state 
religion which gives even the semblance of possibility 
for Celtic mythology to be found in every hero-legend. 
It is, in short, the neglect of this among other historical 
facts which has led the folklorist into error of a some- 
what magnificent kind. He attempts to create out of 
the myths of a people a mythology which provides 
gods to be worshipped, faiths to be organised, and beliefs 
to be the standards of life and conduct. Thus, as I 
have pointed out elsewhere,! Sir John Rhys has, in his 
acute identification of the worship of the water-god 
Lud on the Thames and of Nod on the Severn,? intro- 
duced the idea of a great Celtic worship established on 
these two great rivers as parts of a definite system of 
Celtic religion, whereas examination proves that the 
parallel faiths of two perfectly distinct Celtic tribes, the 
Silures on the Severn and the Trinovantes on the 
Thames, were welded into a common worship of the 
god of the waters by the masters of Celtic Britain, the 
Romans. There was no Celtic organisation which 
commanded both Severn and Thames until the Romans 
occupied the country, and occupying the country they 
adopted into their own religion the native gods and, 
fortunately for us, recorded their adoption in the pave- 
ments of their houses or their temples. ®

  106 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
Mr. A. B. Cook goes much further than Sir John 
Rhys. He attempts to dig out the European sky-god 
from all sorts of queer places, all sorts of forgotten 
records, thereby producing a wealth of folklore parallels 
for which every student must be profoundly thankful. 
But he does not make it anywhere clear that this 
universal god was gloriously apparent to his wor- 
shippers. There is no established connection between 
the sky-god and those who worshipped the sky-god, 
and we seek in vain amidst all the brilliant researches, 
which have been held to produce evidence of the sky- 
god, for evidence that he was worshipped by the Aryan- 
speaking Celt and Teuton. In point of fact, we never 
get at the worshippers at all. There is the assump- 
tion of a state mythology without any evidence for the 
existence of the state. 
In place of this obvious necessity we get an immense 
abstraction, worked out with all the subtle ingenuity 
and learning of the Cambridge professor. Mr. Cook 
has, in fact, used the materials he has collected with 
such amazing care to project therefrom just those 
mythological conceptions which Celt and Teuton would 
have worked out for themselves if they, like the Hindu 
and the Greek, had developed the state while they 
were still free to develop their own native beliefs. 
This they never did, and so their fire worship did not 
advance beyond its early stages. It was separated 
from nature worship to become the servant of the 
European tribes. It helped them to develop tribal and 
family institutions. It produced for them a tribal and 
family worship. It did not get beyond this, because 
Roman institutions and Christianity stood in the way
-P-A-G-E-143
HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 107 
and prevented tribal fire worship from becoming 
anthropomorphised into a mythology. This need not 
cause us to doubt that the analogies claimed by these 
scholars are true analogies. There were among the 
Celtic peoples, as among other branches of the race to 
which Celt, Greek, Teuton, Scandinavian, and Hindu 
belonged, the incipient elements which would go to 
make up a national or state mythology, when the nation 
or the state emerged, as it did emerge in the case of 
Greece and of Rome, from its tribal originals. But the 
Celtic state did not emerge from tribalism in Britain ; 
the Celtic heroes were always tribal heroes. They 
were, as Hereward and Arthur were, real human flesh 
and blood, fighting and raiding and loving and feasting 
in their tribal fashion as the later heroes did in their 
national fashion; because of their success as tribal 
heroes they had attached to them the tribal myths; 
because they died as nobly as Cuchulain died they 
left imperishable records among those for whom they 
died. They were more than gods to the Celtic tribes- 
man—they were kinsmen. 
The false conception of a state religion before there 
was a state, appears in other studies not primarily based 
upon folklore research, and not having in view an- 
thropological results. It is the basis of the remarkable 
researches of Sir Norman Lockyer as to the astrological 
and solar origin of Stonehenge and other circles, and 
in his chapter which deals with the question, ‘‘ Where 
did the British worship originate?” he finds himself 
bound to the theory of a borrowed civilisation which 
established the solar system.! This borrowed civilisa- 
1 See his Stonehenge and Other British Stone Monuments, chap. xxii. 
   
-P-A-G-E-144
  108 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
tion is Egyptian, but it is too much to ask mythology 
to supply not only a complete system of belief but 
a civilisation which belongs to it. What is needed is 
independent evidence of the civilisation. Without 
such independent evidence it is impossible to accept 
the deduction drawn only from one sphere of in- 
formation. 
The error of transferring to the domain of mythology 
events and occurrences which belong to history, is 
followed by an error of another sort, namely, the trans- 
ferring to some general department of human belief the 
particular beliefs of a people, or of tribes of people. It 
is wrong to continue to label particular cults as nature 
myths, when they have already been transferred from 
that position to a more definite position among the be- 
liefs of a people. Thus even so good a scholar as Mr. 
A. B. Cook, rightly interpreting Greek evidence of the 
hill-top fires and of the house fire, yet denies to the 
exactly corresponding Irish evidence the same interpre- 
tation, and argues that ‘‘the ritual of Samain, at which 
all the hearths in Ireland were supplied with fresh fire 
from a common centre at Tlachtga [is] almost certainly 
solar,” and that ‘‘ we shall not be far wrong if we sup- 
pose that the solar fires of Beltaine were the ritual of 
the sky god connected with the Ash of Uisnech.”? Mr. 
Frazer, too, has interpreted these bonfires as mainly 
sun charms, and he sees in the Balder myth, and in the 
peasant customs all over Europe, which he asserts 
illustrate this myth, an ancient ritual which originally 
marked the beginning of the new year, when the tree

  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 109 
spirit, or spirit of vegetation, was burned, the special 
reasons why the deity of vegetation should die by fire 
being that as ‘‘ light and heat are necessary to vegetable 
growth, on the principle of sympathetic magic, by 
subjecting the personal representative of vegetation to 
their influence you secure a supply of these necessaries 
for trees and crops.”! Mr. Frazer goes far afield for evi- 
dence. He does not see that the fire ceremonies which 
he collects from all Europe have a specialised signifi- 
cance, even in their last stages of existence as survivals, 
which is not found among the Incas, the African tribes, 
the hill tribes of India, and the Chinese, whom he cites 
as providing the required parallels. Parallel practices 
are not necessarily evidence of parallels in culture, and 
it is the failure to locate properly the several examples 
in relationship to each other which produces a loose and 
inadequate conception of the relics of fire worship in 
European countries, and the refusal to recognise its 
special place as the cult of a tribal people.? Another 
example of this fundamental error takes us in the very 
opposite direction to that of Dr. Frazer. Thus Dr. 
Gummere, in a recent study dealing with Germanic 
origins,’ sees nothing in the fire cult of the Indo- 
European people but a branch, and apparently an 
undeveloped branch, of general nature worship, not 
specially Germanic or Indo-European, not specialised 
by the tribes and clans of these people into a cult far

inclined to review his explanation of bonfires as sun-charms; see his

more closely connected with their doings and their life 
than mere participation in the general primitive nature 
worship could have afforded. 
The danger of searching for a general system of 
belief and worship from the beliefs and rites of peoples 
not ethnically, geographically, or politically connected 
is very great, and I venture to think that even Mr. 
Frazer’s remarkable researches into the agricultural 
rites of European peoples do not take count of one 
important consideration. I think his constructive hypo- 
thesis is too complex in process and too systematic in 
form to have been the actual living faith of the varied 
paganism of the European peoples. It would have 
meant as organised an institution as the Christian 
Church itself, and of this there is no evidence what- 
ever. It would have meant an exclusive agricultural 
ceremony, and of this there is strong evidence to the 
contrary. It would have meant a deep system of 
philosophy, penetrating from the highest to the lowest 
of the people, and of this there is no evidence. The 
plain fact is that the historical conditions have been 
altogether left out of consideration in these matters, 
and we consequently do not get a complete study. We 
get the advocate’s position. The case for the mytho- 
logical interpretation of folklore has been put with full 
strength, but it is not the entire case.

This short survey of the relationship of tradition to 
history would not answer its purpose if we did not 
consider the complementary position which history

bears to tradition. , This may best be done by reference 
to the period before that occupied by contemporary 
native record. The history here alluded to is, properly 
speaking, only derived from one source, namely, the 
works of foreign or outside authorities. It is written 
by observers from a civilised country, travelling among 
the more primitive peoples of another land, and the 
Greek and Latin authors who relate particulars of 
early Britain were of this class. Their narratives have 
to be compared with the traditions written down as 
history by professed historians, who lived long after the 
events happened to which the traditions are said to 
relate, but who recorded the traditions of the people 
preserved in the monasteries by devotees who were of 
the people, or by the songs and rhymes which, as 
Henry of Huntingdon states explicitly, were used for 
the purpose. 
Both the observations of the foreign historians and 
travellers and the recorded traditions from native 
sources have been treated with scant courtesy whenever 
they cannot be explained according to the views of 
each particular inquirer into the period to which they 
refer. They have been alternatively the subject of dis- 
pute or neglect by students for a long series of years. 
They consist of items which do not fit in with Celtic 
or Teutonic institutions as we know them from other 
and more detailed sources. They offend against the 
national pride because they tell of a condition of 
savagery. They do not appeal to the historian, because 
the historian knows little and cares nothing at all about 
the condition of savagery. If, therefore, they are not 
rejected as true history, they are purposely neglected.

by the right method, and they stand over for examina- 
tion by any one who will take the trouble to deal with 
them by the light and test of modern research. 
It is not my purpose to deal with these matters now, 
but it is advisable that we should try to understand two 
things—first, how they have been dealt with by the 
historian ; secondly, their true place in history. 
The Greek and Latin authors who have stated of 
peoples living in Britain many characteristics which 
do not belong to civilisation or even to the borders of 
civilisation, range from Pytheas the Greek in the 
middle of the fourth century before our era down to 
the Latin poets of the early fifth century anno Domini. 
They all refer to the British savage. He is cannibal- 
istic, incestuous, naked, possesses his wives in common, 
lives on wild fruits and not cultivated cereals, indulges 
in head-hunting, has no settled living-place which can 
be called a house, and generally betrays the character- 
istics of pure savagery.! Altogether there is a fairly 
substantial range of material for the formation of a 
reasonable conception of the condition of savagery in 
Britain.

We need not dwell long upon the earlier of our 
historians who have neglected or contested the state- 
ments of the authorities they use. They hardly pos- 
sessed the material for scientific treatment, and personal 
predilections were the governing factors of any opinion 
which is expressed. John Milton, in his brave attempt 
to tell the story of early England, does not so much as 
allude to these disagreeable points. Hume disdain- 
fully passes by the whole subject and practically begins 
with the Norman conquest. Lappenberg says of the 
group marriage of the Britons that it ‘‘is probably a 
mere Roman fable.”! Innes accepts the views of the 
classical authorities and argues from them in his own 
peculiar way,’ but Sullivan will have it that the 
materials afforded from classical sources are worthless: 
‘they consist of mere hearsay reports without any 
sure foundation, and in many cases not in harmony 
with the results of modern linguistic and archeological 
investigations.”* Neither Turner nor Palgrave has 
_any doubt as to the authority of these early accounts,‘ 
and Dr. Giles accepts the accounts which he so usefully 
collected from the original authorities.® 
The modern historian cannot, however, be so in- 
cidentally treated. He lives in the age of the compara-

tive sciences and of anthropological research. He 
sometimes uses, though in a half-hearted and incom- 
plete fashion, the results of inquirers in these fields of 
research, but he nowhere deals with the problem fully. 
His sins are not general, but special. He agrees with 
one statement of his original authority and disagrees 
with another, and we are left with a chaos of opinion 
founded upon no accepted principle. If the earlier 
historians accepted or rejected historical records without 
much reason for either course, the later historians have 
no right to follow them. The terms ‘‘savage” and 
“barbarian,” indulged in by the Greek and Roman 
writers, cannot be rejected by modern authorities simply 
because they are too harsh. They cannot be considered 
merely in the nature of accusations against the stand- 
ing and position of our ancestors, made by advocates 
anxious to blacken the national character. Even 
scholars like Mr. Skene, Mr. Elton, and Sir John 
Rhys, though inclined to weigh these passages by the 
light of ethnographic research, throw something like 
doubt upon the exact extent to which they may be 
taken as evidence. Mr. Elton, though admitting that 
the early ‘‘romances of travel” afford some evidence 
as to the habits of our barbarian ancestors, cannot 
quite get as far in his belief as to think that the account 
of ‘‘the Irish tribes who thought it right to devour 
their parents” is much more than a traveller’s tale.? 
Sir John Rhys is not quite sure that the account by

in his mind,”! though he notes elsewhere that ‘the 
vocabulary of the Celts will be searched in vain for 
a word for son or daughter as distinguished from boy 
or girl” as a fact of no little negative importance in 
relation to Cesar’s ‘‘ugly account”;? and he has 
similar doubts to express, noteworthy among them 
being the passage from Pliny which illustrates the 
Godiva story.* Mr. Skene lays stress upon the fact 
that Tacitus ‘‘neither alludes to the practice of their 
staining their bodies with woad nor to the supposed 
community of women among them”; and he offers 
some kind of excuse for the Roman evidence as to the 
tattooing with representations of animals,‘ evidence 
which Sir John Rhys, too, is chary of accepting in its 
full sense. Mr. Pearson reluctantly accepts Czesar’s ac- 
count of the group marriage and the human sacrifice of 
the Druids, but he ignores all else, including the at- 
tested cannibalism of the Atticotti, though he mentions 
that tribe in another connection. Sir James Ramsay 
agrees that the Britons tattooed their bodies with woad, 
recognises the fact that their matrimonial customs were 
polyandric, and that brother-and-sister marriage ob- 
tained, and generally accepts the prevalent ideas as to 
Celtic Druidism with its sacrificial rites and the system 
of ‘state worship.” He rests his views for much of 
this upon the anthropological evidence in support of it.®

Mr. Lang on behalf of Scotland, and Dr. Joyce on 
behalf of Ireland, have their say on the evidence. 
Mr. Lang seems to accept Cesar’s evidence ‘if 
correctly reported,” throws doubts upon the ethno- 
logical value of such customs, and declares roundly 
that to found theories upon such evidence as archeology 
provides ‘‘is the province of another science, not 
of history.”! Dr. Joyce says that in early Greek 
and Roman writers there is not much reliable in- 
formation about Ireland, though he believes them 
when they talk of students from Britain residing in 
Ireland and of books existing in Ireland in the fourth 
century.? 
This meagre result from the historians seems to me 
to be most unfortunate. Even when the testimony of 
early writers is accepted, it is accepted without the 
necessary filling in which such an acceptance warrants. 
Bare acceptance does not tell us much. Each recorded 
fact has a relationship to surrounding facts, should 
lead us to associated facts which, escaping observation 
by early writers, can nevertheless be restored. In 
history they are isolated and unconnected, because of 
the faults of the historian who records them. Anthropo- 
logically they belong to a wider grouping, reveal a 
connection with each other which is otherwise un- 
suspected, and prepare themselves for treatment on a 
larger platform. The historian has used them for the 
unprofitable controversy ranging round the question 
of early Celtic civilisation, whereas they clearly belong 
to the history of early man, and even the folklorist does

not disdain to cast them on one side when they do not 
suit his purpose.! 
It is still more unfortunate that Sir Henry Maine 
should have sought to enhance the value of his Indian 
evidence by contrasting it with what he calls ‘the 
slippery testimony concerning savages which is 
gathered from travellers’ tales,”® and that Mr. Herbert 
Spencer should have replied to this in an angry note, 
declaring that he was aware ‘‘that in the eyes of most, 
antiquity gives sacredness to testimony, and that so 
what were travellers’ tales when they were written in 
Roman days have come in our days to be regarded as 
of higher authority than like tales written by recent or 
living travellers.”* The scorn passed upon ‘‘travellers’ 
tales,” the application of the term ‘‘romance” to the 
early descriptions of voyages, have done the same 
amount of mischief to these early chapters of history 
as the constant disbelief in the value of tradition has 
done to the testimony of folklore. 
Now I do not recall these controversies, or lay stress 
upon what appear to me to be the shortcomings of the 
historian and folklorist in their relationship to each 
other, for the purpose of reawakening old antagonisms. 
I have merely selected a few illustrations of the present 
position of the subject in order that it may be seen how 
essential it is to proceed on other lines. All the items 
1 In addition to Mr. Lang and Dr. Joyce, who are folklorists as well 
as historians, and who as we have seen do deal with these records 
scientifically, the folklorist goes out of his way to reject these records.

polyandrous customs ‘‘cannot be said to have been proved,” Mythology

which have formed the subject of dispute, together 
with others which have escaped attention—items which 
have found their way into history by accident, which 
are by nature fragmentary and isolated, which do not 
connect up with anything that is distinctively Celtic or 
Teutonic, and which do not apparently fit in with any 
standard common to themselves—must command atten- 
tion if only because they alone cannot be cut out of 
history when items standing side by side with them are 
allowed to remain, and in the end it can, I think, be 
shown that they command attention because of their 
inherent value. 
The method of investigation as to the importance 
and significance of these earliest historical records 
must be anthropological. They are in point of fact so 
much anthropological data relating to Britain. It is 
no use calling them history, and then defining that 
history as bad history simply because as history the 
recorded facts do not appear to be credible. As a 
matter of fact they belong to the prehistory period of 
Britain, and to test their value scientific methods are 
required. 
In the first place, anthropology shows that there is no 
prima facie necessity for calling them Celtic, thus 
identifying them with that portion of our ancestry 
which is Celtic in race; for there is evidence of a non- 
Celtic race existing in prehistoric times, and existing 
down to within historic times, if not to modern times. 
Mr. Willis Bund has recently summarised the evidence 
from archeology, philology, and tradition as it ap- 
pears in a particularly valuable local study of ancient 
Cardiganshire, stating it ‘‘to be agreed that there was    
   
           
    
                                 
-P-A-G-E-157
  HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 119 
more than one race of early inhabitants, and two of 
the sources say that there was an original race and at 
least two distinct races of invaders,” and further, ‘‘that 
whoever the original inhabitants were they were not 
Celts.”! These original inhabitants, who were not Celts, 
have left their remains in the barrows and megalithic 
monuments which still exist in various parts of the 
country, and anthropologists show that they have not 
entirely disappeared from among the race distinctions 
observable among the people of these islands. If it is 
possible to proceed from this to another stage, and to 
show from the British evidence what Mr. Risley has so 
well illustrated from the Indian evidence, namely, that 
gradations of race types as shown by anthropometrical 
indices correspond with gradations of social pre- 
cedence and social organisation,” it may yet be pos- 
sible to prove that the people who were not Celts 
were the people with whom originated those recorded 
customs and beliefs which are rejected as too savage 
for the Celt. Unfortunately, we know nothing about 
them, except the isolated scraps which are to be picked 
up from the early historians. This compels us to turn 
to other sources of information, and when we do this 
we find that British folklore preserves in traditional 
custom, rite, belief, and. folk-tale, parallels to each 
and every item of savagery mentioned by the early 
historians of Britain; and further, that anthropology 
shows clearly enough that among the customs and 
beliefs of primitive races there are to be found parallels 
to every item of custom and belief recorded of early

Britain. This gets rid of one of our greatest diffi- 
culties, and disposes of Dr. Sullivan’s unwarranted 
assertion to the contrary (an/e, p. 113). The recorded 
customs and beliefs of early Britain are proved by this 
means not to be impossible or improbable factors in 
the elements of the British prehistoric race. It will 
not be possible to term them inventions of romance or 
of false testimony, simply on the ground that they are 
not found elsewhere. On the contrary it will, I think, 
be difficult to resist the conclusion that inventions such 
as these, covering a wide and ascertained area of 
sociological and early religious development, could 
hardly have been made by historians having the 
limited range of knowledge possessed by the native 
and classical writers who are responsible for the facts. 
It is an easy, but not a satisfactory method of criticism 
to declare what is not to one’s liking to be invention 
and romance, and it has until late years been difficult 
to combat such an argument. The battle has raged 
round wordy disputes, the merits of which are governed 
by the abilities of the respective disputants; that 
this is no longer possible is due to the fact that there 
have entered into the fray the methods and results of 
folklore which prevent the terms invention and romance 
from being applied, except where there is good indepen- 
dent reason for their use. 
I have now dealt with all the points which appear to 
be necessary in order to show the inherent relationship 
of folklore to history, and I have shown causes for 
resisting the claims of mythology to appropriate what
-P-A-G-E-159
   HISTORY AND FOLKLORE 121 
it chooses of folklore, and then to reject all the rest 
from consideration. I have dealt (1) with examples of 
local traditions and hero-traditions, in their relation to 
history and historical conditions ; (2) with the folk-tale 
in its retention of details of early historic conditions, and 
of the picture of early tribal organisation, and in that 
its structure is based upon the events of savage social 
conceptions ; (3) with the early laws and rules of tribal 
society preserved by tradition and accepted in historical 
times ; (4) with the claims of mythology to interpret the 
meaning of folk-tales, and the reasons for rejecting 
this claim ; and (5) with the treatment by historians of 
statements by classical writers as to the condition of the 
peoples inhabiting Britain before the dawn of civilisa- 
tion. I think it will be admitted that, without pre- 
tending in any way to have exhausted the evidence, or 
even to have thoroughly comprehended and satis- 
factorily stated it under each of these heads, a very 
considerable claim has been made out for the. his- 
torical value of folklore. If so much has been gained 
it will rest with folklorists to pursue investigations on 
these lines, and it will remain with the historian to 
consider the results wherever his research leads him 
into domains where the evidence of folklore is obtain- 
able. 
It will be seen that the problems which the two 
sciences, history and folklore, have to solve in conjunc- 
tion are not a few and that they are extremely complex. 
They cannot be solved if history and folklore are sepa- 
rated; they may be solved if the professors in each work 
together, both recognising what there is of value in the 
other. History in its earliest stages is either entirely

    122 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
dependent upon foreign authorities, or it has to follow 
the practice of the earlier and unscientific historian and 
to deny that there is any history, or at all events any 
history worth recording, before the advent, perhaps 
the accidental advent, of an historian on native ground. 
History in its later stages is dependent upon the per- 
sonal tastes or ability of each historian for the record 
of events and facts. Folklore in its earliest stages has 
brought down from the most ancient times memories 
of ancient polity, faith, custom, rite, and thought. In 
its later stages it has preserved custom, rite, and belief 
amid the attacks of the progressive civilisation which has 
been developed, and it has clothed heroes of later times 
with the well-worn trappings of those of old. Combined 
history and folklore can restore much of the picture of 
early times, and can work through the fulness of later 
times with some degree of success. There is needed for 
this work, however, a clear conception of the position 
properly held by both sciences, together with es- 
tablished rules of research. This is more particularly 
needed in the department of folklore. I do not pretend 
to be able to formulate these rules. In the subjects 
dealt with in this chapter I have indicated a few of the 
points which must be raised, and my object will be in 
the remaining chapters to set forth some of the condi- 
tions which it appears to me necessary to consider in 
connection with the problems with which folklore is 
concerned as one of the historical sciences.  
-P-A-G-E-161
  CHAPTER II 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
HE materials of folklore consist of traditional 
tales (so called) and traditional customs and 
superstitions (so called), the feature of both 
groups being that at the time of first being recorded 
and reduced to writing they existed only by the force 
of tradition. There is no fixed time for the record. It 
is sometimes quite early, as, for instance, the examples 
which come to us from historians; it is generally quite 
late, namely, the great mass of examples which, during 
the past century or so, have been collected directly 
from the lips or observances of the people, sometimes 
by the curious traveller or antiquary, lately by the pro- 
fessed folklorist. 
The consideration of the relationship of history and 
folklore has cleared the ground for definitions and 
method. Before the material of which folklore con- 
sists can be considered by the light of method, we 
must get rid of definitions which are often applied to 
folklore in its attributed sense. Folk-tales are not 
fiction or art, were not invented for amusement, are not 
myth in the sense of being imaginative only.1 Cus- 
toms and superstitions are not the result of ignorance 
1 Mr. MacCulloch, in the title of his interesting book, the Childhood of 
Fiction, has emphasised this mischievous idea. I am not convinced to 
the contrary by the evidence he gives as to the popularity of the folk-tale 
123
-P-A-G-E-162
  124 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
and stupidity. These attributes are true only if folk- 
tales, customs, and superstitions are compared with 
the literary productions and with the science and the 
culture of advanced civilisation ; and this comparison is 
exactly that which should never be undertaken, though 
unfortunately it is that which is most generally adopted. 
The folk-tale may be lent on occasion to the artist—to 
Mr. Lang, to Mr. Jacobs, and their many copyists; and 
these artists may rejoice at the wonderful results of the 
unconscious art that resides in these products of tradi- 
tion, but the folk-tale must not be wholly surrendered. 
It does not belong to them. It does not belong to art 
at all, but to science. That it is artistic in form is an 
addition to its characteristics, but has nothing what- 
ever to do with its fundamental features. Similarly 
with legend. It may be lent to Malory, to Tennyson, 
to Longfellow, to the literary bards of the romance 
period, for the purpose of weaving together their story 
of the wonderful ; but it must not be surrendered to the 
romancist, and, above all things, the romances must 
never be allowed to enter the domain of folklore. 
Romances may be stripped of their legends so that the 
source of legendary material may be fully utilised, but 
among all peoples (p. 2), Indeed, the book itself is an emphatic testi- 
mony against its title. Mr. MacCulloch evidently began with the idea 
that the folk-tale belonged to the domain of fiction. Thus the opening 
words of his book are: ‘‘ Folk-tales are the earliest form of romantic 
and imaginative literature—the unwritten fiction of early man and of 
primitive people in all parts of the world”; whereas as he nears the end 
of his study he observes: ‘Thus, in their origin, folk-tales may have 
had some other purpose than mere amusement; they may have embodied 
the traditions, histories, beliefs, ideas, and customs of men at an early 
stage of civilisation” (p. 451). Mr. MacCulloch himself proves this to 
be the case, and it is therefore all the more unfortunate that he should 
have stamped his very important study with the word “fiction,”
-P-A-G-E-163
  
MATERIALS AND METHODS 125 
the romances themselves belong to literature, and must 
remain within their own portals. And so with cus- 
toms. They may be pleasing and reveal some of the 
beauties of the older joyousness of life which has passed 
away, it is to be regretted, from modern civilisation ; 
they may be revived in May-day celebrations, in 
pageants, in providing our schools with games which 
tell of the romance of living. But they do not belong 
to the lover of the beautiful or to the revivalists. 
Equally with the folk-tale they belong to science. And 
so also with superstitions. The Psychical Research 
Society, the spiritualists, the professional successors of 
the medizval witch and wizard, may turn their atten- 
tion to traditional superstitions; but the folklorist refuses 
to hand them over, and claims them for science. 
This use of traditional material for modern purposes 
is not the only danger to proper definitions. There is 
also its appearance in the earlier stages of literature. 
The traditional narrative, the myth, the folk-tale or the 
legend, is not dependent upon the text in which it 
appears for the firsttime. That text, as we have it, was 
not written down by contemporary or nearly contem- 
porary authority. Before it had become a written docu- 
ment it had lived long as oral tradition.1 In some 
1 A folk-tale of the Veys, a North African people, explains this view 
most graphically in its opening sentences. The narrator begins his tale 
by saying: ‘I speak of the long time past ; hear! It is written in our old- 
time-palaver-books—I do not say then , in old time the Vey people had 
no books, but the old men told it to their children and they kept it; 
afterwards it was written” (Journ. Ethnol. Soc., N.S., vi. 354). A parallel 
to this comes from Ireland: ‘‘What I have told your honour is true; and 
if it stands otherwise in books, it’s the books which are wrong. Sure 
we've better authority than books, for we have it all handed down from 
generation to generation” (Kohl’s Zravels in Ireland, 140). 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  126 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
cases the written document is itself centuries old, the 
record of some early chronicler or some early writer 
who did not make the record for tradition’s sake. 
In other cases the written document is quite modern, 
the record of a professed lover of tradition. This 
unequal method of recording tradition is the main source 
of the difficulty in the way of those who cannot accept 
tradition as a record of fact. In all cases the test of its 
value and the interpretation of its testimony are matters 
which need special study and examination before the 
exact value of each tradition is capable of being de- 
termined. The date when and the circumstances in 
which a tradition is first reduced to literary form are im- 
portant factors in the evidence as to the credibility of 
the particular form in which the tradition is preserved; 
but they are not all the factors, nor do they of themselves 
afford better evidence when they are comparatively an- 
cient than forms of much later date and of circumstances 
far different. It cannot be too often impressed upon 
the student of tradition that the tradition itself affords 
the chief if not the only sure evidence of its age, its 
origin, and its meaning; for the preservation of tradi- 
tion is due to such varied influences that the mere fact 
of preservation, or the particular method or date of pre- 
servation, cannot be relied upon to give the necessary 
authority for the authenticity of the tradition. Tradi- 
tion can never assume the position of written history, 
because it does not owe its origin, but only its preserva- 
tion, to writing. 
Documentary material is examined as to its paleo- 
graphical features, as to the testimony afforded by its 
author or assumed author, as to its credibility in deal- 
   
-P-A-G-E-165
  MATERIALS AND METHODS 127 
ing with contemporary events or persons, as to its date, 
and in other ways according to the nature of the docu- 
ment. Traditional material has nothing to do with all 
this. It has no paleography ; it has noauthor, and if a 
personal author is assigned to any given fragment or 
element it is generally safe to ignore the tradition as the 
product of a later age; it does not deal with persons 
nor, as a rule, with specific events; it has no date. It 
has therefore to undergo a process of its own before it 
can be accepted as historical evidence, and this process, 
if somewhat tedious, is all the more necessary because 
of the tender material of which tradition is composed. 
This will be made clearer if we understand exactly what 
the different classes of tradition are and how they stand 
to each other. 
Considering the materials of folklore in their true 
sense and not their attributed sense then, we may pro- 
ceed to say something as to methods. Definitions and 
rules are needed. No student can attack so immense a 
subject without the aid of such necessary machinery, 
and it is because the attempt has been so often made ill- 
equipped in this respect, that the science of folklore has 
suffered so much and has remained so long unrecog- 
nised. Already, in dealing with the relationship of 
history and folklore, one or two necessary distinctions 
in terms have been anticipated. We have discovered 
that the impersonal folk-tale is distinguished in a funda- 
imental manner from the personal or local legend, and 
hat the growth of mythology is a later process than 
he growth of myth. These distinctions need, however, 
o be systematised and brought into relationship with 
ther necessary distinctions. The myth and the folk-     
                                            
    
       
-P-A-G-E-166
  128 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
tale are near relations, but they are not identical, and it 
is clear that we need to know something more about 
myth. Because mythic tradition has been found to 
include many traditions, which of late years have been 
claimed to belong to a definitely historical race of 
people, it must not be identified with history. This 
claim is based upon two facts, the presence of myth in 
the shape of the folk-tale and the preservation of much 
mythic tradition beyond the stage of thought to which it 
properly belongs by becoming attached to an historical 
event, or series of events, or to an historical personage, 
and in this way carrying on its life into historic periods 
and among historic peoples. The first position has 
resulted in a wholesale appropriation of the folk-tale to 
the cause of the mythologists ; the second position has 
hitherto resulted either in a disastrous appropriation of 
the entire tradition to mythology, or in a still more dis- 
astrous rejection both of the tradition and the historical 
event round which it clusters. Historians doubting the 
myth doubt too the history; mythologists doubting 
the history reject the myth from all consideration, and 
in this way much is lost to history which properly 
belongs to it, and something is lost to myth. 
If, therefore, I have hitherto laid undue stress 
upon the foundation of tradition in the actual facts of 
life, and upon the close association of tradition with 
historic fact, it is because this side of the question has 
been so generally neglected. Everything has been 
turned on to the mythic side. Folk-tales have been 
claimed as the exclusive property of the mythologists, 
and those who have urged their foundation on the facts 
of real life have scarcely been listened to. There is, 
       
                                                   
-P-A-G-E-167
MATERIALS AND METHODS 129 
however, no ground for the converse process to be 
advocated. If tradition is not entirely mythology it is 
certainly not all founded on sociology, and the mythic 
tradition in the possession of a people advanced in 
culture has to be considered and accounted for. It is 
myth in contact with history, and the contact compels 
consideration of the result. 
I 
The first necessity is for definitions. Careful atten- 
tion to what has already been said will reveal the fact 
that tradition contains three separate classes, and I 
would suggest definition of these classes by a precise 
application of terms already in use: The my¢h belongs 
to the most primitive stages of human thought, and is 
the recognisable explanation of some natural pheno- 
menon, some forgotten or unknown object of human 
origin, or some event of lasting influence; the folk- 
tale is a survival preserved amidst culture-surround- 
ings of a more advanced stage, and deals with events 
and ideas of primitive times in terms of the experience 
or of episodes in the lives of unnamed human beings ; 
the legend belongs to an historical personage, locality, 
or event. These are new definitions, and are suggested 
in order to give some sort of exactness to the terms 
in use. All these terms—myth, folk-tale, and legend— 
are now used indiscriminately with no particular de- 
finiteness. The possession of three such distinct terms 
forms an asset which should be put to its full use, and 
this cannot be done until we agree upon a definite 
meaning for each. 
K 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  130 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
The first place must be given to mythic tradition. 
This is not special to our own, or to any one branch 
of the human race. It belongs to all—to the Hindu, 
the Greek, the Slav, the Teuton, the Celt, the Semite, 
and the savage. It goes back to a period of human 
history which has only tradition for its authority, in 
respect of which no contemporary records exist, and 
which relates to a time when the ancestors of now 
scattered peoples lived together, and when they were 
struggling from the position of obedient slaves to all 
the fears which unknown nature inflicted on them, to 
that of observers of the forces of nature. 
Traditions which are properly classed as myth are 
those which are too ancient to be identified with his- 
torical personages, and too little realistic to be a 
relation of historical episodes. They are rather the 
explanations given by primitive philosophers of events 
which were beyond their ken, and yet needed and 
claimed explanation. In this class of tradition we are in 
touch with the struggles of the earliest ancestors of man 
to learn about the unknown. Our own research in the 
realms of the unknown we dignify by the name and 
glories of science. The research of our remote ancestors 
was of like kind, though the domain of the unknown 
was so different from our own. It was primitive science. 
The best type of this class of myth is, I think, the 
creation myth.!. Everywhere, almost, man has for a 
moment stood apart and asked himself the question, 
Whence am I?—stood apart from the struggle for

existence when that struggle was in its most severe 
stages. The answer he has given himself was the 
answer of the Darwin of his period. From the narrow 
observation of the natural man and his surroundings, 
governed by the enormous impressions of his own life, 
the answer has obviously not been scientific in our sense 
of the term. But it was scientific. It was the science of 
primitive man, and if we have to reject it as science not 
so good as our science, nay, as not science at all judged 
by our standard, we must not deny to primitive man 
the claim of having preceded modern man in his ob- 
servation and interpretation of the world of nature. 
The range of the creation myth is almost world-wide. 
It includes examples from all quarters, and examples of 
great beauty as well as-of singular, almost grotesque 
hideousness ; the New Zealand myth is surely the best 
type of the former, and perhaps the Fijian of the latter. 
As Mr. Lang says: ‘‘all the cosmogonic myths waver 
between the theory of construction, or rather of recon- 
struction and the theory of evolution very rudely con-

the science was all wrong. What is to the point is to 
say that the attempt was made to get at the origin of man 
and his destiny. Mr. Lang thinks that ‘‘the origin of 
the world and of man is naturally a problem which has 
excited the curiosity of the least developed minds,” but 
in the use of the term ‘‘naturally,” I think the stupendous 
nature of the effort made by the least developed minds 
is entirely neglected, and we miss the opportunity of 
measuring what this effort might mean. 
When savages ask themselves, as they certainly do 
ask themselves, whence the sky, whence the winds, the 
sun, moon, stars, sea, rivers, mountains and other 
natural objects, they reply in terms of good logic applied 
to deficient knowledge. All the knowledge they possess 
is that based upon their own material senses. And there- 
fore, when they apply that knowledge to subjects outside 
their own personality, they deal with them in terms of 
their own personality. How did the sky get up there, 
above their heads—the sky evidently so lovingly fond 
of the earth, so intimately connected with the earth ? 
The New Zealand answer to these questions is a 
great one, by whatever standard it is measured. 
Heaven and earth, they say, were husband and wife, so 
locked in close embrace that darkness everywhere pre- 
vailed. Their children were ever thinking amongst 
themselves what might be the difference between dark- 
ness and light. At last, worn out by the continued 
darkness, they consulted amongst themselves whether 
they should slay their parents, Rangi and Papa, ze. 
heaven and earth, or whether they should rend them 
apart. The fiercest of their children exclaimed, ‘‘ Let us 
slay them!” but the forest, another of the sons, said,

“Nay, not so. It is better to rend them apart, and to 
let heaven stand far above us and the earth to lie under 
our feet. Let the sky become as a stranger to us, but 
the earth remain close to us as our nursing-mother.” 
The brothers consented to this proposal with the excep- 
tion of Tawhiri-ma-tea, the father of winds and storms ; 
thus five of the brothers consented and one would not 
agree. Then each of the brothers tries to rend his 
parents, heaven and earth, asunder. First the father 
of cultivated food tries and fails; then the father of 
fish and reptiles; then the father of uncultivated food ; 
then the father of fierce human beings. Then at last 
slowly uprises Tane-mahuta, the father of forests, birds, 
and insects, and he struggles with his parents; in vain 
he strives to rend them apart with his hands and arms. 
Lo, he pauses ; his head is now firmly planted on his 
mother, the earth; his feet he raises up and rests against 
his father, the skies ; he strains his back and limbs with 
mighty effort, and at last are rent apart Rangi and 
Papa, who shriek aloud with cries and groans. But 
Tane-mahuta pauses not, he regards not their shrieks 
and cries; far, far beneath him he presses down the 
: earth ; far, far above him he thrusts up the sky. Then 
were discovered a multitude of human beings whom 
heaven and earth had begotten, and who had hitherto 
lain concealed. But Tawhiri-ma-tea, the wind and 
storm, the brother who had not consented, is angry at 
this rending apart of his parents, and he rises and 
follows his father, the sky, and fights fiercely with the 
earth and his brothers.?

legend on the lines adopted by Dr. Tylor.

  134 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
The explanation of this myth is simple. Unaided 
by the facts of science, the New Zealand savages could 
only think of the facts of their own experience. Only 
two personalities could produce the various products of 
the world; therefore the earth was the mother and the 
sky the father. But they are now separated and apart. 
Only a personality could have separated, and the forest, 
root-sown in the earth, branch-up in the sky, is evidently 
the means of this separation. And so, satisfactorily to 
their own minds, these rude savages settled the question 
of the origin of heaven and earth. 
The close similarity of this to the story of Kronos 
has frequently been pointed out; but a Greek story is 
always worth repeating. Near the beginning of things 
Earth gave birth to Heaven. Later, Heaven became the 
husband of Earth, and they had many children. Some 
of these became the gods of the various elements, 
among whom were Okeanos, and Hyperion, the sun. 
The youngest child was Kronos of crooked counsel, 
who ever hated his mighty sire. Now the children of 
Heaven and Earth were concealed in the hollows of 
Earth, and both the Earth and her children resented this. 
At last they conspired against their father, Heaven, and, 
taking their mother into the counsels, she produced Iron 
and bade her children avenge her wrongs. Fear fell 
upon all of them except Kronos, and he determined to 
separate his parents, and with his iron weapon he 
effected his object. All the brothers rejoiced except one, 
Okeanos, and he remained faithful to his father.!

It would be well for the sake of the story itself to 
give a creation myth from India, but I shall have other 
use for it than its particular charm. 
“In the beginning, when Twashtri came to the creation 
of woman, he found that he had exhausted his materials in 
the making of man, and that no solid elements were left. 
In this dilemma, after profound meditation, he did as follows. 
He took the rotundity of the moon, and the curves of 
creepers, and the clinging of tendrils, and the trembling of 
grass, and the slenderness of the reed, and the bloom 
of flowers, and the lightness of leaves, and the tapering 
of the elephant’s trunk, and the glances of deer, and the 
clustering of rows of bees, and the joyous gaiety of sun- 
beams, and the weeping of clouds, and the fickleness of the 
winds, and the timidity of the hare, and the vanity of the 
peacock, and the softness of the parrot’s bosom, and the 
hardness of adamant, and the sweetness of honey, and 
the cruelty of the tiger, and the warm glow of fire, and the 
coldness of snow, and the chattering of jays, and the cooing 
of the &dkz/a, and the hypocrisy of the crane, and the fidelity 
of the chakrawdka, and compounding all these together, he 
made woman and gave her to man. But after one week, 
man came to him and said: Lord, this creature that you 
have given me makes my life miserable. She chatters in- 
cessantly and teases me beyond endurance, never leaving me 
alone; and she requires incessant attention, and takes all 
my time up, and cries about nothing, and is always idle ; 
and so I have come to give her back again, as I cannot live 
with her. So Twashtri said: Very well; and he took her 
back. Then after another week, man came again to him 
and said: ‘‘Lord, I find that my life is very lonely, since I 
gave you back that creature. I remember how she used to 
dance and sing to me, and look at me out of the corner of 
her eye, and play with me, and cling to me; and her laughter 
was music, and she was beautiful to look at, and soft to 
touch; so give her back to me again. So Twashtri said:
-P-A-G-E-174
  
136 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
Very well; and gave her back again. Then after only 
three days, man came back to him again and said: Lord, I 
know not how it is; but after all I have come to the con- 
clusion that she is more of a trouble than a pleasure to me; 
so please take her back again. But Twashtri said: Out on 
you! Be off! I will have no more of this. You must 
manage how you can. Then man said: But I cannot live 
with her, And Twashtri replied: Neither could you live 
without her. And he turned his back on man, and went on 
with his work. Then man said: What is to be done? for I 
cannot live either with her or without her.’”! 
Now this myth has, so far as its central fact is con- 
cerned, its counterpart in Celtic folklore. In the 
Welsh Mabinogi of Math, son of Mathonwy, it is re- 
lated how Arianrod laid a destiny upon her son, whom 
she would not recognise, that he should never have 
a wife of the race that now inhabits the earth, and how 
Gwydion declared that he should have a wife notwith- 
standing. ‘‘They went thereupon unto Math, the son 
of Mathonwy, and complained unto him most bitterly 
of Arianrod. Well, said Math, we will seek, I and 
thou, by charms and magic, to form a wife for him out 
of flowers. So they took the blossoms of the oak, and 
the blossoms of the broom, and the blossoms of the 
meadow-sweet, and produced from them a maiden, the 
fairest and most graceful that man ever saw.” No one 
can doubt that this interesting fragment of Welsh 
tradition takes us back to a creation legend of the same 
order as the Indian legend, and that the two widely 
separated parallels belong to the period when men were 
carving out for themselves theories as to the origin of 
women in relation to men.

Moon, 13-15, and printed it in his Mystic Rose, 33-34.

It is impossible to deny a place among these myths 
of creation to the Hebrew tradition of Adam and Eve 
in the Garden of Eden. The first chapter of Genesis 
is the answer which the early Hebrews gave to the 
scientific question as to the origin of man. How much 
it cost them to arrive at this conclusion one cannot 
guess, one only knows that it has become a glory to 
the ages of Hebrew history, as well as to the civilisation 
of Christianity. Unfortunately it has become much 
more. The science of the primitive Hebrew has been 
adopted as the God-given revelation to all mankind. 
It is the function of folklore to correct this error, to 
restore the Hebrew tradition to its proper place among 
the myths of the world which have answered the cry of 
early man for the knowledge of his origin. There is 
no degradation here. Science is no longer in doubt 
as to the origin of man within the evolutionary process 
of the natural world, and it rightly rejects the first 
chapter of Genesis as of value to modern research. But 
science should accept it as a chapter in the history of 
anthropology, a chapter which has only proved not to 
be true, because of the limited range of early man in 
the facts about man, but a chapter, nevertheless, which 
has the inherent value of a faithful record of man’s 
search after truth. This is a great position. This is 
the revelation which is made to us from the first 
chapter of Genesis, and when the theologian is bold 
and able enough to step outside the formularies of his 
ancient faith, and reach the magnificent world of 
thought which lies in front of him by the revelations of 
scientific discovery, he will consider the anthropological 
interpretation of the Hebrew Bible as one of the neces-

sary elements of his equipment. There is on present 
lines a whole world of thought between science and 
religion, although they both have the same object. 
They both seek the great unknown. Science, however, 
gives up all efforts in the past which have proved futile 
and erroneous, cheerfully surrenders all errors of 
research and interpretation, starts investigation afresh, 
begins new discoveries, and rewrites the story they 
have to tell. Religion, on the other hand, comes to 
a full stop when once she has made or accepted a dis- 
covery, when once she has pronounced that the great 
unknown has become known to her votaries and sup- 
porters. She is skilful to use the results of science up 
to the point where they serve her purpose, and to use 
the terms of science in order to build up her shattering 
position. But she does not advance. She does not 
accept the first chapter of Genesis as a wonderful 
revelation of the early stages of human investigation 
into the realms of the unknown, but still keeps to her 
old formula of a revelation of the deity as to the origin 
of man, and she does not see that by this attitude she 
is lessening every day her capacity for teaching truth. 
I think the attitude of science to the Hebrew tradition 
is only a little less unfortunate than that of religion. 
Professor Huxley employed all the resources of his 
great knowledge to disprove the scientific accuracy of 
the tradition, and when one rereads his chapters on this 
subject! one wonders at the absence of the sense of 
proportion. Perhaps it was necessary, considering the

place which the Hebrew tradition occupies in civilised 
thought, to show its utter inconsistency with the facts 
of nature, but it was equally necessary to show that it 
has its place in the history of human thought. The 
folklorist replaces it among the myths of creation, and 
then proceeds to analyse and value it. The Hebrew is 
shown by the myth he adopted to have frankly acknow- 
ledged that the origin of man and of the world was un- 
discoverable by him. Whatever older myths he once 
possessed, he discarded them in favour of a mythic 
God-creator, and this is only another way of stating 
that the mystery of man’s origin could not, to the 
Hebrew mind, be met by such a myth as the New 
Zealander believed in, or as the Kumis believed in, but 
could only be met by the larger conception of a special 
creation. The Hebrew could not find his answer in 
nature, so he appealed to super-nature. His God was 
the unknown God, and the realm of the unknown God 
was the unknowable. Though in terms this may not 
be the interpretation of the Hebrew creation myth, its 
ultimate resolve is this ; and because modern science 
has penetrated beyond this confession of the unknown 
origin of man to the evolution of man, it should not 
therefore treat contemptuously the effort of early 
Hebrew science. Because it is not possible to admit 
this effort as part of modern science, it must not be 
rejected from the entire region of science. It must be 
respected as one of the many efforts which have made 
possible the last effort of all which proclaims that man 
has kinship with all the animal world. 
These points illustrate the unsatisfactory attitude of 
science and religion to myth. There is still to notice 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  140 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
the unsatisfactory attitude of the folklorist. Wrong 
interpretation of special classes of myth is, of course, 
to be anticipated in the commencement of a great study 
such as folklore; but there are also wrong interpreta- 
tions of the fundamental basis of myth. Thus even 
Mr. Frazer, with all his vast research into savage 
thought and action, doubts the possession of good 
logical faculty by mankind. If mankind, he says, had 
always been logical and wise, history would not be a 
long chronicle of folly and crime.!_ But surely we cannot 
doubt man’s logical powers. They have been too 
strong for his facts. He has applied mercilessly all the 
powers of his logical faculties upon isolated observa- 
tions of phenomena, and it is this limited application 
which has produced the folly and crime. I venture to 
think that civilised man shares with the savage of to- 
day, and with the primitive ancestors of all mankind, the 
charge of applying perfectly good logic to an insuffi- 
ciency of facts, and producing therefrom fresh chapters 
of folly and crime. 
If myth is correctly defined as primitive science, as 
I have ventured to suggest, it is important to know 
how it assumes a place among the traditions of a 
people. Primitive science was also primitive belief. 
If it accounted for the origin of mankind, of the sun, 
moon, and stars, of the earth and the trees, it accounted 
for them as creations of a higher power than man, or, 
at all events, of a great and specially endowed man, 
and higher powers than man were of the unknown

realm. The unknown was the awful. Primitive science 
and primitive belief were therefore on one and the 
same plane.1 They were subjects to be treated with 
reverence and with awe. The story into which the 
myth was so frequently woven is not a story to those 
who believe in the truth of the myth. It assumes the 
personal shape, because the personal is the only 
machinery by which primitive man is capable of ex- 
pressing himself. It was held only by tradition, 
because tradition was the only means of transmitting 
it, and it was of asacred character, because sacred things 
and beliefs were the only forces which influenced primi- 
tive thought. When it was repeated to new genera- 
tions of learners, it was not a case of story-telling—it 
was a matter of the profoundest importance. Every- 
where among the lowest savagery we find the secrets of 
the group kept from all but the initiated, and these 
secrets are the traditions which have become sacred, 
traditions expressed sometimes in ceremonial, some- 
times in rites, sometimes in narratives. Thus the 
mythological and religious knowledge of the Bushmen 
is imparted in dances, and when a man is ignorant of 
some myth, he will say, ‘‘I do not dance that dance,” 
meaning that he does not belong to the group which 
preserves that particular sacred chapter.” The Ashantees 
have an interesting creation myth which is stated to be 
1 Mr. Jevons practically arrives at this conclusion from a different 
standpoint. ‘‘ Beliefs,” he says, ‘‘are about facts, are statements 
about facts, statements that certain facts will be found to occur in a 
certain way or be of a certain kind” (Zntvod. to Hist. of Religion, 402). 
Mr. Curtin, Creation Myths of Primitive America (p. xx), confirms the 
view I take.

the foundation of all their religious opinions.1. Mr. 
Howitt, in his important chapter on “ Beliefs and Burial 
Practices,”? seems to me to exactly interpret the savage 
mind. The first thing he notes is the belief—a belief 
that ‘‘the earth is flat, surmounted by the solid vault 
of the sky,” that ‘‘there is water all round the flat 
earth,” that the sun is a woman, and that the moon 
was once a man who lived on earth, and soon. Then, 
secondly, he notes the manner in which these beliefs 
are translated to and held by the people, the myth in 
point of fact—unfortunately, Mr. Howitt calls it a 
legend —wherein it is perfectly obvious that the 
Australian is interpreting the facts of nature in the 
only language known to him to be applicable, namely, 
1 This myth is, I think, worth giving, because of its obvious object 
to account for the difference between white and black races. It is as 
follows: “In the beginning of the world God created three white men 
and three white women, and three black men and three black women. 
In order that these twelve human souls might not thenceforth complain 
of Divine partiality and of their separate conditions, God elected that 
they should determine their own fates by their own choice of good and 
evil. A large calabash or gourd was placed by God upon the ground, 
and close to the side of the calabash was also placed a small folded 
piece of paper. God ruled that the black man should have the first 
choice. He chose the calabash, because he expected that the calabash, 
being so large, could not but contain everything needful for himself. 
He opened the calabash, and found a scrap of gold, a scrap of iron, and 
several other metals of which he did not understand the use. The 
white man had no option. He took, of course, the small folded piece of 
paper, and discovered that, on being unfolded, it revealed a boundless 
stock of knowledge. God then left the black men and women in the 
bush, and led the white men and women to the seashore. He did not 
forsake the white men and women, but communicated with them every 
night, and taught them how to construct a ship, and how to sail from 
Africa to another country. After a while they returned to Africa with 
various kinds of merchandise, which they bartered to the black men and 
women, who had the opportunity of being greater and wiser than the 
white men and women, but who, out of sheer avidity, had thrown away 
their chance.”

that of his own personality. Messrs. Spencer and 
Gillen produce much the same kind of evidence,’ and 
describe a ceremony among the northern tribes con- 
nected with the myth of the sun, which ends in a 
newly initiated youth being brought up, ‘‘shown the 
decorations, and had everything explained to him.”? 
Among the central tribes the same authorities describe 
minutely the initiation ceremonies, during which the 
initiate boy ‘‘is instructed for the first time in any of 
the sacred matters referring to totems, and it is by 
means of the performances which are concerned with 
certain animals, or rather, apparently with the animals, 
but in reality with Alcheringa individuals who were 
the direct transformations of such animals, that the 
traditions dealing with this subject, which is of the 
greatest importance in the eyes of the natives, are 
firmly impressed upon the mind of the novice, to 
whom everything which he sees and hears is new and 
surrounded with an air of mystery.”* Sir George 
Grey, speaking of the traditions of the Maori which 
he collected, says his reader will be in ‘‘the position of 
one who listens to a heathen and savage high priest, 
explaining to him in his own words and in his own 
energetic manner, the traditions in which he earnestly 
believes, and unfolding the religious opinions upon 
which the faith and hopes of his race rest.”4 This

’ “school of mythology and history,” as it is signifi- 
cantly termed in John White’s Ancient History of the 
Maori, was ‘‘ Whare-Kura, the sacred school in which 
the sons of high priests were taught our mythology and 
history,” and it ‘‘ stood facing the east in the precincts 
of the sacred place of Mua.” The school was opened by 
the priests in the autumn, and continued from sunset to 
midnight every night for four or five months in succes- 
sion. The chief priest sat next to the door. It was 
his duty to commence the proceedings by repeating a 
portion of history ; the other priests followed in succes- 
sion, according to rank. On the south side sat the 
old and most accomplished priests, ‘‘ whose duty it 
was to insist on a critical and verbatim rehearsal of 
all the ancient lore.”! The American-Indian account, 
by the Iroquois, of how myths were told to an ancient 
chief and an assembly of the people on a circular open 
space in a deep forest, wherein| was a large wheel- 
shaped stone, from beneath which came a voice which 
told the tale of the former world, and how the first 
people became what they are at present,” is in exact 
accord with this evidence. The priestly novice among 
the Indians of British Guiana is taught the traditions 
of the tribe, while the medicine man of the Bororéd 
in Brazil has to learn certain ritual songs and the 
languages of birds, beasts, and trees.* 
I do not want to press the point too far, because 
evidence is not easy to get on account of the incomplete

fashion in which it has been collected and presented to 
the student. The records of native life are divided off 
into chapters arranged, not on the basis of native ideas, 
but on the basis of civilised ideas, and from this cause 
we get myth and belief in different chapters as if they 
had no connection with each other ; we get myths treated 
as if they were but the fancy-begotten amusements of 
the individual, instead of the serious ideas of the collec- 
tive people about the elements of nature to which they 
have directed their attention. Mr. J. A. Farrer comes 
practically to this correct conclusion, while Mr. Jevons 
seems to me to have arrived at the same result in spite 
of some false intermediate steps, due to his failure to 
discriminate between myth and mythology.’ Failures 
of this kind are of almost infinite loss to scientific 
research. They stop the results which might flow from 
the stages correctly reached, and hide the full signifi- 
cance which arises from the fact that man’s aspirations 
are always so much in excess of his accomplished acts. 
Poetry, philosophy, prayer, worship, are all short of the 
ideal; and the question may surely arise whether the 
actual accomplishments of man in civilisation, as com- 
pared with those of man in savagery, afford any sort of 
indication of the distance between man’s accomplish- 
ment and his aspiration at any age. If man has never 
travelled at one moment of time, or at one definite 
period of life, all this distance in thought, it may still

be possible to use this distance between savage and 
cultured accomplishment as a standard of measurement 
between accomplishment and ideal, wherever the 
material for such a purpose is available. If folk- 
lorists will keep such a possibility in mind, whenever 
they are called upon to investigate myth, it will at 
all events save them from proceeding upon lines which 
cannot lead to progress in the investigation of human 
history. 
The primitive myth does not include all that properly 
comes within the definition of myth. There must be 
included the myth formed to explain a rite or cere- 
mony, which originating in most ancient times has been 
kept up at the instance of a particular religion or cult, 
but the meaning and intent of which has been for- 
gotten amidst the progress of a later civilisation. 
Pausanias is the great storehouse of such myths as 
this, and Mr. Lang has, more than any other scholar, 
examined and explained the process which has 
gone on. 
There is also included in this secondary class of 
myth, the myths upon which are founded the great 
systems of mythology. The Hindu mythology, in spite 
of all that has been done to place it on the pedestal of 
primitive original thought, is definitely relegated to the 
secondary position by its best exponents. The Vedic 
religion is tribal in form, and in the pre-mythological 
stage.! In the Ramayana and Mahabharata, on the 
contrary, ‘‘we trace unequivocal indications of a de- 
parture from the elemental worship of the Vedas, and 
the origin or elaboration of legends which form the

great body of the mythological religion of the Hindus.”? 
The pre-mythological and the mythological stages of 
Hindu religion, therefore, are both discoverable from 
the traditional literature which has descended from 
both ages, and this fact is important in the classifica- 
tion of the various phases of tradition. When once 
it is admitted that the beginnings of mythology are to 
be traced in one section of the people who are supposed 
to derive a common system of mythology from a com- 
mon home, future research will hesitate to interpret, 
as Kuhn and Max Miiller and their school have done, 
the traditions of Celts, Teutons, and Scandinavians as 
the detritus of ancient mythologies instead of the 
beginnings of what, under favourable conditions, might 
have grown into mythologies. Mythological tradition 
is essentially a secondary not a primary stage. This 
fact is overlooked by many authorities, and I have 
noted some of the unfortunate results. It is not over- 
looked by those who study the principles of their subject 
as well as the details. Thus, as Robertson-Smith has 
so well explained, ‘‘mythology was no essential part 
of ancient religion, for it had no sacred sanction and 
no binding force on the worshippers. . . . Belief in 
a certain series of myths was neither obligatory as 
a part of true religion, nor was it supposed that by 
believing a man acquired religious merit and con- 
ciliated the favour of the gods. What was obligatory 
or meritorious was the exact performance of certain 
sacred acts prescribed by religious tradition. This 
being so, it follows that mythology ought not to take

-P-A-G-E-186
  148 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
the prominent place that is too often assigned to it 
in the scientific study of ancient faiths.”1 This is 
exactly the position, and all that I have advanced for 
the purpose of aiming at a classification of the various 
kinds of tradition is in accord with this view. 
All that I am anxious to prove, all that it is possible to 
prove, from these considerations of the position occupied 
by myth, is that myths constitute a part of the serious life 
of the people. They belong to the men and women, per- 
haps some of them to the men only and others to the 
women only, but essentially to the life of the people. 
I do not think that even Mr. Hartland in his special 
study of the subject has quite understood this. He 
begins at a later period in the history of tradition, the 
period of storytelling proper, when myths have become 
folk-tales,? and he treats this period as the earliest 
instead of the secondary stage of myth. In this stage 
something has happened to push myth back from the 
centre of the people’s life to a lesser position—a new 
religious influence, a new civilisation, a new home, any 
one of the many influences, or any combination of in- 
fluences, which have affected peoples and sent them 
along the paths of evolution and progress. 
It is in this way that we come upon the folk-tale. 
The folk-tale is secondary to the myth. It is the primi- 
tive myth dislodged from its primitive place. It has 
become a part of the life of the people, independently

2 Mr. Hartland passes rapidly in his opening chapter from the myth 
as primitive science to the myth as fairy tale, from the savage to the 
Celt (Science of Fairy Tales, pp. 1-5), and I do not think it is possible to 
make this leap without using the bridge which is to be constructed out 
of the differing positions occupied by the myth and the fairy tale.
-P-A-G-E-187
  MATERIALS AND METHODS 149 
of its primary form and object and in a different sense. 
The mythic or historic fact has been obscured, or has 
been displaced from the life of the people. But the 
myth lives on through the affections of the people for the 
traditions of their older life. They love to tell the story 
which their ancestors revered as myth even though it has 
lost its oldest and most impressive significance. The 
artistic setting of it, born of the years through which it 
has lived, fashioned by the minds which have handed 
it down and embellished it through the generations, 
has helped its life. It has become the fairy tale or the 
nursery tale. It is told to grown-up people, not as 
belief but as what was once believed; it is told to 
children, not to men; to lovers of romance, not to wor- 
shippers of the unknown; it is told by mothers and 
nurses, not by philosophers or priestesses|; in the 
gathering ground of home life, or in the nursery, not 
in the hushed sanctity of a great wonder.? 
1 It will be interesting, I think, to preserve here one or two instances 
of the actual practice of telling traditional tales in our own country, 
Mr. Hartland has referred to the subject in his Science of Fairy Tales, 
but the following instances are additional to those he has noted, and 
they refer directly back to the living custom. They are all from Scot- 
land, and refer to the early part of last century. ‘In former times, 
when families, owing to distance and other circumstances, held little 
intercourse with each other through the day, numbers were in the habit 
of assembling together in the evening in one house, and spending the 
time in relating the tales of wonder which had been handed down to 
them by tradition” (Kiltearn in Ross and Cromarty ; Sinclair, Statistical 
Account of Scotland, xiv. 323). ‘‘In the last generation every farm and 
hamlet possessed its oral recorder of tale and song. The pastoral 
habits of the people led them to seek recreation in listening to, and in 
rehearsing the tales of other times ; and the senachie and the bard were 
held in high esteem” (Inverness-shire, zbid., xiv. 168). ‘‘In the winter 
months, many of them are in the habit of visiting and spending the 
evenings in each other’s houses in the different hamlets, repeating the 
songs of their native bard or listening to the legendary tales of some 
venerable senachie” (Durness in Sutherlandshire, 2bid., xv. 95).
-P-A-G-E-188
  
150 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
The influence of changing conditions upon the 
position of mythic tradition is well illustrated by 
Dr. Rivers in his account of the Todas. This people, 
he says, ‘‘are rapidly forgetting their folk-tales and the 
legends of their gods [that is, their myths], while their 
ceremonial remains to a large extent intact and seems 
likely to continue so for some time.” Dr. Rivers at- 
tributes this to the effect of intercourse with other 
people. This intercourse has had no missionary results 
and has not therefore affected their religious rites and 
ceremonies, but has shown itself largely in the form of 
loss of interest in the stories of the past.!. In other 
words, and in accordance with the definitions I am 
suggesting, the primitive myths of the Todas have 
definitely assumed a secondary position as folk-tale, and 
not a strong position at that, while religion has clung 
to rite and formula. 
Primitive myth dislodged in this fashion is some- 
times preserved in a special manner and for religious 
purposes in its ancient setting as a belief, or as a 
tradition belonging to sacred places and appertaining 
to sacred things. This is what has happened to the 
Genesis myth of the Hebrews; it has also happened to 
some of the sacred myths of the Hindus, and perhaps 
to some of the sacred myths of the Greeks. In this 
position the myth may even be reduced to writing, and 
where this happens all the sacredness appertaining to 
tradition is transferred to the written instrument. 
Thus in Arkadia, Pausanias tells us, was a temple of 
Demeter, and every second year, when they were cele- 
brating what they called the greater mysteries, they 
1 W. Hz. R. Rivers, The Todas, 3-4. 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
MATERIALS AND METHODS 151 
took out certain writings which bore on the mysteries, 
and having read them in the hearing of the initiated, 
put them back in their place that same night.! In India 
examples occur of land being held for telling stories 
at the Uchdos or festivals of the goddess Dévi.2 The 
colleges of Rome, composed of men specially skilled 
in religious lore, and charged with the preservation of 
traditional rules regarding the more general religious 
observances, the proper fulfilment of which implied a 
certain amount of information, and rendered it neces- 
sary for the state in its own interest to provide the 
faithful transmission of that information, have been 
described by Mommsen.*® 
I pass to the third class of tradition, namely, the 
legend, and this need not detain us long. We have 
already illustrated it by the notes on history and folk- 
lore, and by its very nature it belongs essentially to 
the historic age. In dealing with legend, there is first 
to determine whether its characters are historical, or 
are unknown to history. If the former, there is next 
to disengage those parts of the tradition which, by their 
parallels to other traditions, or by their nature, may 
be safely certified as not belonging to the historical 
hero or to the period of the historical hero. If the 
latter, the details must be analysed to see what elements 
of culture are contained therein. In both cases tra- 
dition will have served a purpose, and that purpose 
must be sought. Tradition does not attach itself to

152 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
an historical personage without cause. There is 
necessity for it, and in the case of Hereward the 
necessity was proved to have been the great gap in 
the history of a national hero. Tradition does not pre- 
serve details of primitive culture-history without cause, 
and in the examples already quoted it has been shown 
that this cause rests upon the indissoluble links which 
the uncultured peasant of to-day has with the pre- 
cultured past of his race. He will have forgotten all 
about his tribal life and its consequences, but will 
retain legends which are founded upon tribal life. He 
will have lost touch with ideas which proclaim that man 
or woman not of his tribe is an enemy to be feared or 
attacked, but will gladly relate legends which deal 
with events growing out of a state of perpetual strife 
among the ancestors of people now in friendship. He 
will not understand the personal tie of ancient times, 
but will listen to the legends attached to places in such 
strange fashion as to make places seem to possess a 
personal life full of events and happenings. He wiil 
know nothing of giants and ogres, but will love the 
legends which tell of heroes meeting and conquering 
such beings. The history of the school books is 
nothing to him, but the history unknowingly contained 
in the legends is very real, and is applied over and over 
again to such later events as by force of circumstances 
become stamped upon the popular mind and thus 
succeed in displacing the original. It would be an 
important contribution to history to have these legends 
collected and examined by a competent authority. They 
would be beacon lights of national history preserved in 
legend.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 153 
It will be readily conceded, I think, that in attempting 
these definitions of the various classes of tradition, and 
in illustrating them from the records of man’s life in 
various parts of the world, it has been impossible for 
me to deal with certain points in the problem before 
us. In particular I have not considered the favourite 
subject of the diffusion of folk-tales. I do not believe 
in a general system of diffusion, such a system, I mean, 
as would suffice to account for the parallels to be found 
in almost all countries.1_ I think diffusion occupies a 
very small part indeed of the problem, and that it only 
takes place in late historical times. . It is a large subject, 
and I have virtually stated my answer to the theory of 
diffusion in the definitions and classifications which I 
have ventured to put forward. It may be considered by 
some that other facts in the conditions of myth, folk-tale, 
and legend would not confirm the general outline I 
have given of the three classes of tradition to which 
I have applied these terms; and of course there are 
many side issues in so great a problem. I would not 
urge the correctness of the views I have put forward 
as applicable to every part of the world, or to every 
phase in the history of tradition; but I would urge 
that in the great centres of traditional life they are 
practically the only means of arriving at the position 
occupied by tradition, and that in all cases they form 
a working hypothesis upon which future inquirers may 
well base their researches. 
1 Perhaps Mr. Lang’s study of ‘‘ Cinderella and the Diffusion of Tales” 
in Folklore, iv. 413 et seg., contains the best summary of the position. 
   
-P-A-G-E-192
  154 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
II 
Of late years there have been placed alongside of 
the traditional myth, folk-tale, and legend many other 
products of tradition—customs, ceremonies, practices, 
and beliefs, and it has been argued, and argued 
strongly and convincingly, that the tradition which 
has brought down the saga and song as far-off echoes 
of an otherwise unrecorded past has also brought down 
these other elements which must also belong to the 
same distant past. This argument is now no longer 
seriously disputed. But there still remains open for 
discussion the exact kind of evidence which these 
elements of tradition supply, the particular period or 
people from which they have descended, the particular 
department of history to which they relate. All this is 
highly disputed. 
Folklore has in this department been greatly aided 
by Dr. Tylor’s impressive terminology, whereby the 
custom, ceremony, practice, and belief which have come 
down by tradition are classed as “survivals.” This 
term implies an ancient origin, and the necessary 
work of the student is to get back to the original. 
Until very lately the fact of survival has carried with it 
the presumption of ancient origin, but Mr. Crawley 
has raised an objection which I think it is well to meet. 
He urges that ‘‘the history of religious phenomena 
exemplifies in the most striking manner the continuity 
of modern and primitive culture; but there is a ten- 
dency on the part of students to underestimate this 
continuity, and, by explaining it away on a theory of
-P-A-G-E-193
    MATERIALS AND METHODS 155 
survivals, to lose the only opportunity we have of de- 
ducing the permanent elements of human nature.” 
This sentence at once prepares us for much that 
follows; but Mr. Crawley leaves the point itself un- 
touched, except by implication, until he is in the 
middle of his book, and then we have his dictum that 
“it may be finally asserted that nothing which has to 
do with human needs ever survives as a mere survival.”! 
It will at once be seen that we have here a new estimate 
of the force which survivals play in the evidence of 
human progress. They prove the continuity of modern 
and primitive culture. They are part and parcel of 
modern life, filling a vacuum which has not been filled 
by modern thought, carrying on, therefore, the standard 
of religious belief and religious ideal from point to 
point until they can be replaced by newer ideas and 
concepts. This definition of survivals is very bold. 
It answers Mr. Crawley’s purpose and argument in a 
way which no other fact in human history, so far as we 
can judge, could answer it. It is the basis upon which 
his whole argument is founded. Occupying such an 
important place, it should have received explicit in- 
vestigation, instead of being treated as a sort of side 
issue of incidental importance. 
When explicit investigation is undertaken, Mr. 
Crawley’s case must, I think, break down. Survivals 
are carried along the stream of time by people whose 
culture-status is on a level with the culture in which 
the survivals originated. It matters not that these 
people are placed in the midst of a higher civilisation 
or alongside of a higher civilisation. When once the 
1 Crawley, Tree of Life, 5, 144.  
-P-A-G-E-194
  156 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
higher civilisation penetrates to them, the survival is 
lost. There is not continuity between modern and 
primitive thought here, but, on the contrary, there is 
strong antagonism, ending with the defeat and death 
of the primitive survival. This is the evidence wher- 
ever survivals can be studied, whether in the midst of 
our own civilisation, or even of primitive civilisations, 
which constantly exhibit traces of older beliefs and 
ideas being pushed out of existence by newer. It is, 
indeed, a mistake to suppose, as some authorities 
apparently do, that survivals can only be studied when 
they are embedded in a high civilisation. It is almost 
a more fruitful method to study them when they appear 
in the lower strata; and even in such a case as the 
Australian aborigines I think that it is the neglect 
of observing survivals that has led to some of the 
erroneous theories which have recently been advanced 
against Messrs. Spencer and Gillen’s conclusions. 
For the purpose of examining survivals in custom, 
rite, and belief, we have nothing more than a series of 
notes of customs and beliefs obtaining among the 
lower and lowest classes of the people, and not being 
the direct teaching of any religious or academic body. 
These notes are very unequal in value, owing to the 
manner in which they have been made. They are often 
accidental, they are seldom if ever the result of trained 
observation, and they are often mixed up with theories 
as to their origin and relationship to modern society 
and modern religious beliefs. To a great extent the 
two first of these apparent defects are real safeguards, 
for they certify to the genuineness of the record, a certifi- 
cate which is more needed in this branch of inquiry than
-P-A-G-E-195
  MATERIALS AND METHODS 157 
perhaps in any other. But with regard to the third 
defect there is considerable danger. An inquirer with 
an object is so apt to find what he wishes to find, either 
by the exercise of his own credulity or the ingenuous 
extension of inquiry into answer ; whereas the inquirer 
who is content to note with the simplicity of those who 
occupy themselves by collecting what others have not 
collected, may be deficient in the details he gives, but 
is seldom wrong or violently wrong in what he has 
recorded. In every direction, however, great caution 
is needed, and especially where any section of custom 
and belief has already been the subject of inquiry. 
It is indeed almost safe to say that all research into 
custom and belief, even that of such masters as Tylor, 
Lang, Hartland, Frazer, and others, needs re-examina- 
tion before we can finally and unreservedly accept the 
conclusions which have been arrived at. 
Such an examination must be directed towards 
obtaining some necessary points in the life-history of 
each custom, rite, and belief. We have to approach 
this part of our work guided by the fact that folklore 
cannot by any possibility develop. The doctrine of 
evolution is so strong upon us that we are apt to apply 
its leading idea insensibly to almost every branch of 
human history. But folklore being what it is, namely 
the survival of traditional ideas or practices among a 
people whose principal members have passed beyond 
the stage of civilisation which those ideas and prac- 
tices once represented, it is impossible for it to have 
any development. When the original ideas and prac- 
tices which it represents were current as the standard 
form of culture, their future history was then to be
-P-A-G-E-196
158 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
looked for along the lines of development. But so soon 
as they dropped back behind the standard of culture, 
whatever the cause and whenever the event happened, 
then their future history could only be traced along the 
lines of decay and disintegration. We are acquainted 
with some of the laws which mark the development of 
primitive culture, but we have paid no attention to the 
influences which mark the existence of survivals in 
culture. For this purpose we must first ascertain what 
are the component parts of each custom or superstition ; 
secondly, we must classify the various elements in 
each example ; and thirdly, we must group the various 
examples into classes which associate with each other 
in motif and character. 
By this treble process we shall have before us ex- 
amples of the changes in folklore, and demonstrably 
they are changes of decay, not of development. By 
grouping and arranging these changes it may be 
possible to ascertain and set down the laws of change 
—for that there are laws I am nearly certain. It is 
these laws which must be discovered before we can 
go very far forward in our studies. Every item of 
custom and superstition must be tested by analysis to 
find out under which power it lives on in survival, and 
according to the result in each case, so may we hope 
to find out something about the original from which 
the survival has descended. 
Each folklore item, in point of fact, has a life his- 
tory of its own, and a place in relationship to other 
items. Just as the biography of each separate word 
in our language has been investigated in order to 
get at Aryan speech as the interpretation of Aryan
-P-A-G-E-197
    
MATERIALS AND METHODS 159 
thought, so must the biography of each custom, super- 
stition, or story be investigated in order to get at Aryan 
belief or something older than Aryan belief. We must 
try to ascertain whether each item represents primitive 
belief by direct descent, by symbolisation, or by 
changes which may be discovered by some law 
equivalent to Grimm’s law in the study of language. 
Analysis of each custom, rite, or belief will show it 
to consist of three distinct parts, which I would dis- 
tinguish by the following names :— 
1. The formula. 
2. The purpose. 
3. The penalty or result. 
It will be found that these three component parts 
are not equally tenacious of their original form in 
all examples. In one example we may find the 
formula either actually or symbolically perfect, while 
the purpose and penalty may not be easily distinguish- 
able. Or it may happen that the formula remains 
fairly perfect; the purpose may be set down to the 
desire of doing what has always been done, and the 
penalty may be given as luck or ill-luck. Of course, 
further variations are possible, but these are usually the 
more general forms. 
I will give an example or two of these phases of 
change or degradation in folklore. First, then, where 
the formula is complete, or nearly so, and the purpose 
and penalty have both disappeared. At Carrickfergus 
it was formerly the custom for mothers, when giving 
their child the breast for the last time, to put an egg in 
its hand and sit on the threshold of the outer door with 
a leg on each side, and this ceremony was usually done  
-P-A-G-E-198
  160 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
on a Sunday. Undoubtedly I think we have here a 
very nearly perfect formula; but what is its purpose, 
and what is the penalty for non-observance? Upon 
both these latter points the example is silent, and 
before they can be restored we must search among the 
other fragments of threshold customs and see whether 
they exist either separately from the formula or with a 
less perfect example. Secondly, where the formula 
has disappeared and the purpose and penalty remain, 
nearly the whole range of those floating beliefs and 
superstitions which occupy so largely the collections 
of folklore would supply examples. But I will select 
one example which will be to the point. When the 
Manx cottager looks for the traces of a foot in the 
ashes of his firegrate for the purpose of seeing in what 
direction the toes point, the penalty being that, if they 
point to the door, a death will occur, if to the fireplace, 
a birth,! there is no trace of the ancient formula. It is 
true we may find the missing formula in other lands; 
for instance, among some of the Indian tribes of 
Bombay. There the formula is elaborate and complete, 
while the purpose and the penalty are exactly the same 
as in the Isle of Man. But this hasty travelling to 
other lands is not, I contend, legitimate in the first 
place. We must begin by seeing whether there is not 
some other item of folklore, perhaps now not even con- 
nected with the house-fire group of customs and super- 
stitions, whose true place is that of the lost formula of 
this interesting Manx custom. And when once we 
have taught ourselves the way to restore these lost 
formule to their rightful places, the explanation of the 
1 Train, Hist. of Isle of Man, ii. 115.
-P-A-G-E-199
    
MATERIALS AND METHODS 161 
mere waifs and strays of folklore will be attended with 
some approach to scientific accuracy, and we shall then 
be in a position to get rid of that shibboleth so dear to 
the non-folklore critic, that all these things we deal 
with are ‘‘mere superstitions.” 
Thirdly, when the formula is complete, or nearly so, 
and the purpose and penalty become generalised. At 
St. Edmundsbury a white bull, which enjoyed full ease 
and plenty in the fields, and was never yoked to the 
plough or employed in any service, was led in proces- 
sion in the chief streets of the town to the principal 
gate of the monastery, attended by all the monks sing- 
ing and a shouting crowd. Knowing what Grimm has 
collected concerning the worship of the white bull, 
knowing what is performed in India to this day, there 
is no doubt that this formula of the white bull at 
St. Edmundsbury has been preserved in very good 
condition. The purpose of it was, however, not so 
satisfactory. It is said to have taken place whenever a 
married woman wished to havea child ; and the penalty 
is lost in the obvious generalisation that not to perform 
the ceremony is not to obtain the desired end.! 
The second process, that of classification of the 
various elements in each example, will reveal some 
characteristics of folklore, which, so far as I know, 
have never yet been taken count of. One very im- 
portant characteristic is the prevalence of a particular 
belief attached to different objects in different places. 
Thus Sir John Rhys in his examination of Manx 
1 The ceremony is fully described in Relics for the Curious, i. 31; 
Gentleman’s Magazine, 1784 (see Gent. Mag. Library, xxiii. 209), quoting 
from a tract first published in 1634; and see Proc. Soc, Antig. Scot., 
xX. 669. 
M  
-P-A-G-E-200
  162 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
folklore stopped short in his explanation of the 
superstition of the first-foot, because he had heard 
that, while in the Isle of Man it was attached to 
a dark man, elsewhere it was attached to a fair 
man. Of the examples where, on New Year’s morn- 
ing, it is held to be unlucky to meet a dark person, 
I may mention Lincolnshire, Durham, Yorkshire, and 
Northumberland. It is, on the contrary, /ucky to meet, 
as first-foot, a dark-haired man in Lancashire, the Isle 
of Man, and Aberdeenshire.’ In these cases we get the 
element of ‘‘dark” or “‘ fair” as the varying factor of 
the superstition; but instances occur in Sutherlandshire, 
the West of Scotland, and in Durham, where the vary- 
ing factor rests upon sex—a man being lucky and a 
woman being unlucky. 
Similarly of the well-known superstition about tell- 
ing the bees of the death of their owner, in Berkshire, 
Bucks, Cheshire, Cornwall, Cumberland, Lincolnshire, 
Lancashire, Monmouthshire, Notts, Northumberland, 
Shropshire, Somersetshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Sussex, 
Wilts, Worcestershire, it appears that a relative may per- 
form the ceremony, or sometimes a servant merely, while 
in Derbyshire, Hants, Northants, Rutland, and York- 
shire it must be the heir or successor of the deceased 
owner. Again, while in the above places the death of 
the owner is told to the bees, in other places it is told to 
the cattle, and in Cornwall to the trees ;? and, in other 
places, marriages as well as death are told to the bees.® 
In some cases the transfer from one object to another

of a particular superstition is a matter of absolute 
observation. Thus, the labourers in Norfolk con- 
sidered it a presage of death to miss a ‘‘ bout” in corn 
or seed sowing. The superstition is now transferred to 
the drill, which has only been invented for a century. 
Again, in Ireland, it is now considered unlucky to 
give any one a light for his pipe on May-day—a very 
modern superstition, apparently. But the pipe in this 
case has been the means of preserving the old super- 
stition found in many places of not giving a light from 
the homestead fire. 
I will just refer to one other example, the well- 
known custom of offering rags at sacred wells. Sir 
John Rhys thought that the object of these scraps 
of clothing being placed at the well was for trans- 
ferring the disease from the sick person to some one 
else. But I ventured to oppose this idea, and con- 
sidered that they were offerings, pure and simple, to 
the spirit of the well, and referred to examples in 
confirmation. Among other items, I have come across 
an account of an Irish ‘‘station,” as it is called, 
at a sacred well, the details of which fully bear 
out my view as to the nature of the rags deposited 
at the shrine being offerings to the local deity. One 
of the devotees, in true Irish fashion, made his offering 
accompanied by the following words: ‘‘To St. Columb- 
kill—I offer up this button, a bit o’ the waistband o’ 
my own breeches, an’ a taste o’ my wife’s petticoat, in 
remimbrance of us havin’ made this holy station ; an’ 
may they rise up in glory to prove it for us in the last 
day.” I shall not attempt to account for the presence

of the usual Irish humour in this, to the devotee, most 
solemn offering ; but I point out the undoubted nature 
of the offerings and their service in the identification 
of their owners—a service which implies their power 
to bear witness in spirit-land to the pilgrimage of those 
who deposited them during lifetime at the sacred 
well.? 
Now, in all these cases there is an original and 
a secondary, or derivative, form of the superstition, 
and it is our object to trace out which is which. Do 
the rags deposited at wells symbolise offerings to the 
local deity? If so, they bring us within measurable 
distance of a cult which rests upon faith in the power 
of natural objects to harm or render aid to human 
beings. Does the question of first-foot rest upon the 
colour of the hair or upon the sex of the person? I 
think, looking at all the examples I have been able to 
examine, that colour is really the older basis of the 
superstition, and, if so, ethnological considerations are 
doubtless the root of it. Again, if the eldest son of 
the deceased owner of bees appears in the earliest form 
of the death-telling ceremony, we have an interesting 
fragment of the primitive house-ritual of our ancestors. 
When, however, we come upon the worship of 
local deities, when we can suggest ethnological 
elements in folklore, and when we can speak of the 
house-father, and can see that duties are imposed upon 
him by traditional custom, unknown to any rules of 
      
                                                1 Mr. Eden Phillpotts mentions in one of his Cornish stories exactly 
this conception. Rags were offered. ‘‘Just a rag tored off a petticoat 
or some such thing. They hanged ’em up around about on the thorn 
bushes, to shaw as they'd ’a’ done more for the good saint if they'd had 
the power." —Lying Prophets, 60.

civilised society, we are in the presence of facts older 
than those of historic times. It is thus that folklore 
so frequently points back to the past before the age of 
history. Over and over again we pause before the 
facts of folklore, which, however explained, always 
lead us back to some unexplored epoch of history, 
some undated period, which has not revealed its 
heroes, but which has left us a heritage of its mental 
strivings. 
The method of using these notes of custom, rite, 
and belief for scientific purposes is therefore a very 
important matter. It is essential that each single item 
should be treated definitely and separately from all 
other items, and, further, that the exact wording of the 
original note upon each separate item should be kept 
intact. There must be no juggling with the record, no 
emendations such as students of early literary work 
are so fond of attempting. Whatever the record, it 
must be accepted. The original account of every 
custom and belief is a corpus, not to be tampered 
with except for the purpose of scientific analysis, and 
then after that purpose has been effected all the parts 
must be put together again, and the original restored 
to its form. 
The handling of each custom or belief and of its 
separate parts in this way enables us, in the first place, 
to disentangle it from the particular personal or social 
stratum in which it happens to have been preserved. 
It may have become attached to a place, an object, a 
season, a class of persons, a rule of life, and may have 
been preserved by means of this attachment. But 
because every item of folklore of the same nature is 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  166 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
not attached to the same agent wherever that particular 
item has been preserved, it is important not to stereo- 
type an accidental association as a permanent one. 
Moreover, the modern association is not necessarily the 
ancient association, and there is the further difficulty 
created by writers on folklore classifying into chap- 
ters of their own creation the items they collect or 
discuss.! In the second place, we are enabled to 
prepare each item of folklore for the place to which it 
may ultimately be found to belong. The first step in 
this preparation is to get together all the examples of 
any one custom, rite, or belief which have been pre- 
served, and to compare these examples with each other, 
first as to common features of likeness, secondly as 
to features of unlikeness. By this process we are 
able to restore what may be deficient from the in- 
sufficiency of any particular record—and such a restor- 
ation is above all things essential—and to present for 
examination not an isolated specimen but a series of 
specimens, each of which helps to bring back to 
observation some portion of the original. The recon- 
struction of the original is thus brought within sight. 
Generally, it may be stated that the points of like- 
ness determine and classify all the examples of one 
custom or belief; the points of unlikeness indicate the 
line of decay inherent in survivals. 
1 I gave an example of this false classification of folklore in accord 
with its apparent modern association in my preface to Denham Tracts, 
ii, p. ix. The left-leg stocking divination is not associated with dress, 
but with the left-hand as opposed to the right-hand augury, and I 
pointed out that the district of the Roman wall, the Jocus of the Denham 
tracts, thus preserves the luck of the left, believed in by the Romans, 
in opposition to the luck of the right believed in by the Teutons. See 
Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities of the Aryan Peoples, 253-7.

    MATERIALS AND METHODS 167 
This partial equation and partial divergence between 
different examples of the same custom or belief allows a 
very important point to be made in the study of sur- 
vivals. We can estimate the value of the elements 
which equate in any number of examples, and the value 
of the elements which diverge; and by noting how 
these values differ in the various examples we shall 
discover the extent of the overlapping of example with 
example, which is of the utmost importance. A given 
custom consists, say, of six elements, which by their 
constancy among all the examples and by their special 
characteristics may be considered as primary elements, 
in the form in which the custom has survived. Let us 
call these primary elements by algebraical signs, a, 8, c, 
d, e, f. A second example of the same custom has four 
of these elements, a, 0, c, d, and two divergences, which 
may be considered as secondary elements, and which 
we will call by the signs g, 4. A third example has 
elements a, 0, and divergences g, h, 7, k. A further 
example has none of the primary elements, but only 
divergences g, h, 2, 1, m. Then the statement of the 
case is reduced to the following :— 
1=2@, b,¢, d, e, f. 
2= a4,b,¢,d+g,h. 
3= a,b +g, h, i,k 
4= +g, h, t, l,m. 
The first conclusion to be drawn from this is that the 
overlapping of the several examples (No. 1 overlapping 
No. 2ata, b,c, d, No. 2 overlapping No. 3 at a, b+g, h, 
No. 3 overlapping No. 4 at +g, h, 2) shows all these 
several examples to be but variations of one original
-P-A-G-E-206
  168 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
custom, example No. 4, though possessing none of the 
elements of example No. 1, being the same custom as 
example No. 1. Secondly, the divergences g to m 
mark the line of decay which this particular custom has 
undergone since it ceased to belong to the dominant 
culture of the people, and dropped back into the posi- 
tion of a survival from a former culture preserved only 
by a fragment of the people. 
The first of these conclusions is not affected by the 
order in which the examples are arranged ; whether we 
begin with No. 4 or with No. 1, the relationship of 
each example to the others, thus proved to be in inti- 
mate association, is the same. The second conclusion 
is necessarily dependent upon what we take to be ‘‘pri- 
mary elements” and ‘‘secondary elements”; and the 
question is how can these be determined? Asa rule it 
will be found that the primary elements are the most 
constant parts of the whole group of examples, appear- 
ing more frequently, possessing greater adherence to a 
common form, changing (when they do change) with 
slighter variations ; while the secondary elements, on 
the other hand, assume many different varieties of form, 
are by no means of constant occurrence, and do not 
even amongst themselves tend toa common form. The 
primary elements, therefore, constitute the form of the 
custom which represents the oldest part of the survival. 
They alone will help us to determine the origin of the 
custom, whether by features represented in the elements 
thus brought together or by comparison with ancient 
1 I elaborated this plan of comparative analysis in a report to the 
British Association at Liverpool, in 1896 (see pp. 626-656), illustrating it 
from the fire customs of Britain.
-P-A-G-E-207
  MATERIALS AND METHODS 169 
custom elsewhere or with survivals elsewhere similarly 
reconstituted. Altogether these elements, thus linked 
together by the tie of common attributes, are parts of 
one organic whole, and it is on this reconstructed 
organism we have to rely for the evidence from tradi- 
tion. 
When any given custom or belief has undergone 
this double process of analysis of its component parts 
and classification of its several elements, another pro- 
cess has to be undertaken, namely, to ascertain its as- 
sociation with other customs or beliefs, in the same 
country or among the same people, each of which cus- 
toms or beliefs, being treated in exactly the same man- 
ner, is found to exhibit some degree of relationship in 
origin, condition, or purpose to the whole group under 
examination. In this way classification, analysis, and 
association go hand in hand as the necessary methods 
of studying survivals. Without analysis we cannot 
properly arrive at a classification ; without classification 
we cannot work out the association of survivals. 
The process is perhaps highly technical and compli- 
cated. It may not be of interest to all to discuss the 
process by which results are attained when what is 
most desired are the results themselves. But in truth 
the two parts of this study cannot well be separated. 
To judge of the validity of the results one must know 
what the process has been, and too often results are 
jumped at without warrant ; items of custom and usage 
or of belief and myth are docketed as belonging to a 
given phase of culture, a given group of people, when 
they have no right to such a place in the history of 
man. It is not only distasteful to the inquirer, but   
-P-A-G-E-208
  170 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
almost impossible to dislodge any item of folklore once 
so placed, and thus much of the value of the material 
supplied by folklore is lost or discounted. 
Custom, rite, and belief treated in this fashion be- 
come veritable monuments of history—a history too 
ancient to have been recorded in script, too much an 
essential part of the folk-life to have been lost to tra- 
dition. We may hope to restore therefrom the sur- 
viving mosaic of ancient institutions, ancient law, and 
ancient religion, and we may further hope, with this 
mosaic to work upon, to restore much of the entire 
fabric which has been lying so many centuries beneath 
the accumulated and accumulating mass of new de- 
velopments representing the civilisation of the Western 
world. 
Ill 
It is only here that we can discover the point where 
we may properly commence the work of comparative 
folklore. An item of folklore which stands isolated is 
practically of no use for scientific investigation. It 
may be, as we have seen, that the myth is in its 
primary stage as a sacred belief among primitive 
people, in its secondary or folk-tale stage as a sacred 
memory of what was once believed, in its final or 
legendary stage when it does duty in preserving the 
memory of a hero or a place of abiding interest. It 
may be, as we have seen, that the custom, rite, or 
belief is a mere formula without purpose or result, 
a mere traditional expression of a purpose without 
formula or result, a mere statement of result without 
formula or purpose. We must know the exact position
-P-A-G-E-209
    MATERIALS AND METHODS 171 
of each item before we begin to compare, or we may 
be comparing absolutely unlike things. The exact 
position of each item of folklore is not to be found 
from one isolated example. It has first to be restored 
to its association with all the known examples of its 
kind, so that the earliest and most complete form may 
be recorded. That is the true position to which it has 
been reduced as a survival. This restored and com- 
plete example is then in a position to be compared 
either with similar survivals in other countries on the 
same level of culture, or within the same ethnological 
or political sphere of influence, or with living customs, 
rites, or beliefs of peoples of a more backward state 
of culture or in a savage state of culture. Comparison 
of this kind is of value. Comparison of a less techni- 
cal or comprehensive kind may be of value in the hands 
of a great master; but it is often not only valueless 
but mischievous in the hands of less experienced writers, 
who think that comparison is justified wherever simi- 
larity is discovered. 
Similarity in form, however, does not necessarily 
mean similarity in origin. It does not mean similarity 
in motive. Customs and rites which are alike in 
practice can be shown to have originated from quite 
different causes, to express quite different motifs, and 
cannot therefore be held to belong to a common class, 
the elements of which are comparable. Thus to take 
a very considerable custom, to be found both in folk- 
tales and in usage, the succession of the youngest son, 
it is pretty clear that among European peoples it 
originated in the tribal practice of the elder sons going 
out of the tribal household to found tribal households  
-P-A-G-E-210
  172 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
of their own, thus leaving the youngest to inherit the 
original homestead. But among savage peoples where 
the youngest son inherits the homestead, he does not 
do so because of a tribal custom such as that to be 
found in the European evidence. It is because of the 
conditions of the marriage rites. Thus among the 
Kafir peoples of South Africa 
**the young man of the commonality, who being a young 
man has had but little or no means of displaying his sagacity 
—a quality with them most frequently synonymous with 
cunning—commences for himself in a small way. Hence, 
too, being polygamous, and his wives being bought with 
cattle, his first wife is taken from a position accordant with 
that of a young, untried, and poor or comparatively poor 
man. Hence also it happens that his wives increase in 
number, and in—so to speak—position, in accordance with 
his wealth, and with his reputation for wisdom and sagacity, 
which may have raised him to the rank of headman of a 
district, and one of the Chief’s counsellors. It is, therefore, 
only when old in years that he takes to himself his ‘great 
wife,’ one of greater social and racial position than were his 
previous wives, and her son, that is, her eldest son, who is 
consequently the father’s youngest or nearly his youngest, 
becomes his ‘great son,’ and par excellence the heir. If 
the father be a Chief, this son becomes the Chief at his 
father’s death. 
‘*As, however, subordinate heirs, the father after some 
consultation and ceremony chooses out of his other sons, 
secondly ‘the son of his right hand,’ and thirdly, ‘the son 
of his grandfather.’ If the father be a Chief, these two 
are after his death accounted as Chiefs in the tribe, sub- 
ordinate to the ‘great son,’ and even if through their 
superior energy, the size of the tribe requiring emigration 
to pastures new, or other causes, one or both of them break 
off, and with their respective inheritance or following form a 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
   MATERIALS AND METHODS 173 
separate tribe or tribes, yet they are federally bound to their 
great brother, and their successors to his successors, and 
recognise him as their supreme or national Chief. Thus 
Krili, the Chief of the Amagcaleka tribe across the Kei, was 
also paramount Chief of all the Amaxosas, including his 
own tribe, and those this side the Kei, who are divided into 
the two great divisions—each of which includes several 
tribes—of the Amangquika and Amandhlambi, which latter 
has among it the Amagqunukwebi, a tribe of Caffre inter- 
mingled with Hottentot blood, and therefore rather looked 
down upon.” ! 
Dr. Nicholson, from whom I quote this evidence, 
goes on to say that the 
“‘custom then of the heirship of the youngest, appears to me 
to have not unlikely grown up among a polygamous race, 
and to have arisen both from considerations of self security 
and from those of race and rank.” 
Quite independently of Dr. Nicholson I had come to 
the same conclusion ;? and Dr. Nicholson, after hand- 
somely acknowledging my priority in the ‘‘discovery,” 
very properly alludes to the not unimportant fact of 
two workers in the same field coming to like conclu- 
sions. It is remarkable that the same distinction be- 
tween the succession of the youngest son and of the 
son of the youngest wife appears in folk-tales.» Now 
clearly it would be quite wrong to suggest a parallel 
between the heirship of the youngest among the Kafir 
peoples of Africa and heirship of the youngest among

the tribal people of early Europe. They are not com- 
parable at all points, and it is just where the point 
of comparison fails that it becomes so important to 
science.! 
I will take one other example, and this is the im- 
portant practice of human sacrifice which looms so 
largely in anthropological research, and which is con- 
sidered by so good an authority as Schrader to have 
taken a prominent place among the Aryans,’ though he 
takes his examples, not from language, but from the 
unexamined customs of the Greeks, Romans, northerns, 
Indians, and Persians. We know more about the de- 
velopment of sacrifice now that Professor Robertson 
Smith has dealt with the Semitic part of the evidence. 
Without resting on the fact that the occurrence of human 
sacrifice in a country occupied by Aryan-speaking 
people does not, of itself alone, imply that the rite 
was Aryan, it is far more important to point out that 
among the higher races ‘‘ the feeling that the slaying 
involves a grave responsibility and must be justified by 
divine permission” appears, and ‘‘care was taken to 
slay the victim without bloodshed, or to make believe 
that it had killed itself.”? This feeling marks dis- 
tinctly the Greek sacrifice as at Thargelia and in the 
Leukadian ceremony, the Roman sacrifice at the 
Tarpeian Rock, the sacrifice at the Valhalla rock of the 
northerns, while among the Hindus there is much to 
show that the idea of human sacrifice in some of

nection with bride capture, see Journ. Roy. Asiatic Soc., 1907, p. 624.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 175 
the early writings is a literary borrowing from the 
Hebrews; and that if it ever prevailed among the 
Aryas of India it was very early superseded by 
the sacrifice of animals. Colonel Dalton has given 
good reasons for his views ‘‘that the Hindus de- 
rived from the aboriginal races the practice of human 
sacrifices.”? Although, then, Greek ritual and Greek 
myth are full of legends which tell of sacrifices 
once human, but afterwards commuted into sacrifices 
where some other victim is slain or the dummy of 
a man is destroyed ;* although the significant Hindu 
ceremonial of so throwing the limbs of an animal 
slaughtered to be burnt with the dead that every 
limb lies upon a corresponding part of the corpse ;* 
although Teuton, Celt, and Norse® are credited 
with the practice by authorities not to be ques- 
tioned, it appears by the evidence that the Euro- 
pean form of human sacrifice has little in common with 
the savage form except in the nature of the victim. It 
occurred, as Grimm states, when some great disaster, 
some heinous crime, had to be retrieved or purged, a 
kind of sacrifice, says Mr. Lang, not necessarily

savage except in its cruelty; and the victims were not 
tribesmen, but captive enemies, purchased slaves, or 
great criminals. 
These two examples will serve as warning against the 
too general acceptance of the custom and belief of savage 
and barbaric races, as identical with the custom and 
belief of early or primitive man. Such identification is 
in the main correct; but it is correct not because it has 
been proved by the best methods to be so, but because, 
of all possible explanations, this is the only one that 
meets the general position in a satisfactory manner. 
In many cases, however, it is monstrously incorrect, 
and it is the incorrect conclusion which weighs far more 
against the acceptance of the results of folklore than 
do the correct conclusions in its favour. 
The work which has to be accomplished by the com- 
parative method of research is of such magnitude that 
it needs to be considered. The labour and research 
might in point of volume be out of proportion to the 
results, and it may be questioned, as it has already been 
questioned by inference, whether it is worth the while. 
The first answer to this objection is that all historical 
investigation is justified, however much the labour, 
however extensive the research. Secondly, considering 
the very few results which the study of folklore has 
hitherto produced upon the investigations into pre- 
historic Europe, it must be worth while for the student 
of custom and belief to conduct his experiments upon 
a recognised plan in order to get at the secret of 
man’s place in the struggle for existence, which is de- 
termined more by psychological than by physical 
phenomena. Thirdly, if the psychical anthropology 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
MATERIALS AND METHODS 177 
of prehistoric times is to be sought for in the customs 
and beliefs of modern savages, it is of vital importance 
to anthropological science that this should be established 
by methods exactly defined. Whatever of traditional 
custom and belief is capable of bearing the test and of 
being definitely labelled as belonging to prehistoric 
man, becomes thereafter the data for the psychical 
anthropology of civilised man. Edmund Spenser under- 
stood this when his official duties took him among the 
“wild” Irish. ‘‘ All the customs of the Irish,” he says, 
“which I have often noted and compared with that I 
have read, would minister occasion of a most ample 
discourse of the original of them, and the antiquity of 
that people, which in truth I think to be more ancient 
than most that I know in this end of the world; so as if 
it were in the handling of some man of sound judgment 
and plentiful reading, it would be most pleasant and 
profitable.” + 
Comparative folklore, then, to be of value must be 
based upon scientific principles. The unmeaning custom 
or belief of the peasantry of the Western world of civi- 
lisation must not be taken into the domains of savagery 
or barbarism for an explanation without any thought as 
to what this action really signifies to the history of the 
custom or belief in question. No doubt the explanation 
thus afforded is correct in most cases, and perhaps it 
was necessary to begin with the comparative method in 
order to understand the importance and scope of the 
study of apparently worthless material. A new stage in 
comparative folklore must now be entered upon. It 
must be understood what the effective comparison of a

N 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  178 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
traditional peasant custom or belief with a savage 
custom or belief really amounts to. The process 
includes the comparison of an isolated custom or belief 
belonging, perhaps secretly, to a particular place, a 
particular class of persons, or perhaps a particular 
family or person, with a custom or belief which is part 
of a whole system belonging to a savage race or tribe ; 
of a custom or belief whose only sanction is tradition, 
the conservative instinct to do what has been done by 
one’s ancestors, with a custom or belief whose sanction 
is the professed and established polity or religion of a 
people ; of a custom or belief which is embedded in a 
civilisation, of which it is not a part and to which it is 
antagonistic, with a custom or belief which helps to 
make up the civilisation of which it is part. In carrying 
out such a comparison, therefore, a very long journey 
back into the past of the civilised race has been per- 
formed. For unless it be admitted that civilised people 
consciously borrow from savages and barbaric peoples 
or constantly revert to a savage original type of mental 
and social condition, the effect of such a comparison is 
to take back the custom or belief of the modern peasant 
to a date when a people of savage or barbaric culture 
occupied the country now occupied by their descendants, 
the peasants in question, and to equate the custom or 
belief of this ancient savage or barbaric culture with 
the custom or belief of modern savage or barbaric 
culture. The line of comparison is not therefore simply 
drawn level from civilisation to savagery; but it consists, 
first, of two vertical lines from civilisation and savagery 
respectively, drawn to a height scaled to represent the 
antiquity of savage culture in modern Europe, and
-P-A-G-E-217
  MATERIALS AND METHODS 179 
then the level horizontal line drawn to join the two 
vertical lines. Thus the line of comparison is 
Ancient savagery Ancient savagery 
Savagery Civilisation 
We thus arrive at some conception of the work to be 
accomplished by and involved in comparative folklore. 
The results are worth the work. They relate to stages 
of culture in the countries of civilisation which are 
recoverable by no other means. The stages of culture 
are practically lost to history. In ancient Greek and 
Roman history, and in ancient Scandinavian history, 
there are priceless fragments of information which tell 
us much., But these fragments are not the complete 
story, and they belong to relatively small areas of 
European history. Every nation has the right to go 
back as far in its history as it is possible to reach. It 
can only do this by the help of comparative folklore. 
In our own country we have seen how history breaks 
down, and yet historical records in Britain are perhaps 
the richest in Europe. The traditional materials known 
to us as folklore are the only means left to us, and we 
can only properly avail ourselves of these when we have 
mastered the methods of science which it is necessary 
to use in their investigation.

  CHAPTER III 
PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
LTHOUGH the great mass of folklore rests upon 
tradition and tradition alone, an important aid 
to tradition comes from certain psychological 
conditions which we must now consider. At an early 
stage all students of folklore will have discovered that 
it is not entirely to tradition that folklore is indebted 
for its material. There are still people capable of 
thinking, capable of believing, in the primitive way 
and in the primitive degree. Such people are of 
course the descendants of long ancestors of such 
people—people whose minds are not attuned to the 
civilisation around them; people, perhaps, whose 
minds have been to an extent stunted and kept back 
by the civilisation around them. There can be no 
doubt that civilisation and all it demands of mankind 
acts as a deterrent upon the minds of some living 
within the civilisation zone, and belonging appar- 
ently to the civilised society. This is the root cause of 
some of the lunacy and much of the crime which ap- 
parently exists as a necessary adjunct of civilisation, 
and it leads to various forms of thought incon- 
sistent with the knowledge and ideas of the age. 
When these forms of thought are not concentrated into 
180

    PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 181 
a new religious sect by the operation of social laws, 
they become what is sometimes called mere superstition, 
that kind of superstition which consists of using the 
same power of logic to a narrow set of facts which primi- 
tive man was in the habit of using, and thus repeating 
in this age the methods of primitive science. We 
cannot quite understand this in the age of railways 
and schools and inventions, but it will be understood 
better if we go back for only a generation or two to 
those parts of our country which are most remote from 
civilising influences, and obtain some information as to 
their condition. 
This cannot be better accomplished than by referring 
to a Scottish author writing, in 1835, of the supersti- 
tions then prevailing in Scotland. ‘‘Our whole 
genuine records,” says Dalyell, 
“teem with the most repulsive pictures of the weakness, 
bigotry, turbulence, and fierce and treacherous cruelty of the 
populace. False and corrupt innovations of literature, a com- 
pound of facts and fiction, intermingling the old and the new 
in heterogeneous assemblage, would persuade us to think 
much more of our forefathers than they thought of themselves. 
‘Scotland, until the most modern date, was an utter stranger 
to civilisation, presenting a sterile country with a famished 
people, wasted by hordes of mendicants readier to seize than 
to solicit—void of ingenious arts and useful manufactures, 
possessed of little skill and learning, plunged in constant 
war and rapine, full of insubordination, disturbing public 
rule and private peace. For waving pendants, flowing 
draperies, brilliant colours, eagles’ feathers, herons’ plumes, 
feasts or festivals so splendid in imagination, let naked limbs, 
scanty, sombre garments to elude discovery by the foe, bits of 
heath stuck in bonnets if they had them, precarious suste- 
nance, abject humility and all those hardships inseparable

from uncultivated tribes and countries be instituted as a juster 
portrait of earlier generations,”?! 
This statement as to Scotland is correctly drawn from 
social conditions which have now passed away, but 
which, down to the beginning of last century, belonged 
to the ordinary life of the people. Thus it is recorded 
that 
“over all the highlands of Scotland, and in this county in 
common with others, the practice of building what are called 
head-dykes was of very remote antiquity. The head-dyke 
was drawn across the head of a farm, when nature had 
marked the boundary betwixt the green pastures and that 
portion of hill which was covered totally or partially with 
heath. Above this fence the young cattle, the horses, the 
sheep and goats were kept in the summer months. The 
milch cows were fed below, except during the time the farmer’s 
family removed to the distant grazings called sheilings. 
Beyond the head-dyke little attention was paid to boundaries. 
These enclosures exhibit the most evident traces of extreme 
old age.’’? 
In Ireland the same conditions obtained so late as the 
sixteenth century; the native Irish retained their wander- 
ing habits, tilling a piece of fertile land in the spring, 
then retiring with their herds to the booleys or dairy 
habitations, generally in the mountain districts in the 
summer, and moving about where the herbage afforded 
sustenance to their cattle.* An eighteenth-century

traveller in Ireland was assured that the quarter called 
Connaught was ‘‘ inhabited by a kind of savages,” and 
there is record of the capture of a hairy dwarf near 
Longford, who appears hardly to belong to civilisation. 
Similar conditions obtained in the northern counties of 
England, and in other parts.? Special circumstances 
kept the borderland outside the influences of ordinary 
civilised thought and control, and these circumstances 
have been recorded by an eighteenth-century observer, 
from whom I will quote one or two facts as to the mode 
of life of these people: ‘That they might be more 
invisible during their outrodes and consequently less 
liable to the effects of their enemies’ vigilance, the 
colour of their cloathes resembled that of the scenes of 
their employment or of their season of action, that is, 
of a brown heath and cloudy evening. Thus examples 
of what might condemn their conduct were never 
offered to them, and immemorial custom seemed as it 
were to sanctify their wildness. Every border-man, 
almost without exception, was brought up in a state 
which we would call unhappy, and every circumstance 
of his life tended to confirm his partiality for an un- 
certain bed and unprovided diet.”’* 
The evidence which this acute observer collected led 
him to conclude that the ‘‘almost uniform train of 
circumstances which affected these countries from their 
border situation, and the little difference there was 
between one of the dark ages and another, strongly

induce me to believe that the Northern people were 
little altered in manners from very remote times to 
those immediately preceeding the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth,” and this is confirmed by what we actually 
find from the report of the Commissioners appointed to 
settle the peace of the Marches by fixed and established 
ordinances, who collected ‘‘their ordinances from the 
traditional accounts of ancient usages that had been 
sanctified as laws by the length of time which they had 
endured. These laws were different from most others, 
nay, almost peculiar to the men towhom they belonged.”! 
1 Clarke, Survey of the Lakes, pp. x, xv. Referring to the statutes 
enacted as a result of the Commissioners’ work the facts are as follows: 
There were certain franchises in North and South Tynedale and Hexham- 
shire, by virtue of which the King’s writ did not run there. [Tynedale, 
though on the English side of the border, was an ancient franchise of the 
Kings of Scotland.] In 1293 Edward I. confirmed this grant in favour of 
John of Balliol (1 Rot, Parl., 114-16), and the inhabitants took advan- 
tage of this immunity to make forays and commit outrages in neighbour- 
ing counties. Inthe year 1414, at the Parliament holden at Leicester, 
“grievous complaints” of these outrages were made “‘ by the Commons 
of the County of Northumberland.” It was accordingly provided 
(2 Henry V., cap. 5) that process should be taken against such offenders 
under the common law until they were outlawed ; and that then, upon a 
certificate of outlawry made to lords of franchises in North and South 
Tynedale and Hexhamshire, the offender's lands and goods should be 
forfeited. In 1421 the provisions of this statute were extended to like 
offenders in Rydesdale, where also the King’s writ did not run (9 Henry V., 
cap. 7). Still these excesses continued in Tynedale. By an enact- 
ment of Henry VII. (2 Henry VII., cap. 9) this ‘lordship and bounds” 
were annexed to the county of Northumberland. ‘‘ Forasmuch,” the 
preamble sets forth, ‘‘as the inhabitants and dwellers within the lordships 
and bounds of North and South Tyndale, not only in their own persons, 
but also oftentimes accompanied and confedered with Scottish ancient 
enemies to this realm, have at many seasons in time past committed and 
done, and yet daily and nightly commit and do, great and heinous 
murders, robberies, felonies, depredations, riots and other great tres- 
passes upon the King our Sovereign lord’s true and faithful liege people 
and subjects, inhabiters and dwellers within the shires of Northumber- 
land, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, Exhamshire [sic], the bishopric of

I need not continue these notes as to the backward- 
ness of portions of the country compared with its 
general level of culture, because I have dealt with the 
evidence elsewhere.!| What I am anxious to point out 
here is that the faculty of such people as these to think, 
not in terms of modern science but in terms of their 
own psychological conditions, must have been pro- 
nounced. If they ever put the question to themselves 
as to the origin of things, they would answér them- 
selves according to the life impressions they were then 
receiving, and according to the limited range of their 
actual knowledge. As with the creators of the tradi- 
tional myths, the scientific inquirers of primitive times, 
so with these non-advanced people of later times, they 
would deal with the problems they did not understand 
in fashions suitable to their own understanding. It 
has always appeared to me that the impressions of the 
surrounding life are not sufficiently regarded in their 
Durham and ina part of Yorkshire, in which treasons, murders, robberies, 
felonies, and other the premises, have not in time past in any manner of 
form been punished after the order and course of the common law, by 
reason of such franchise as was used within the same while it was in the 
possession of any other lord or lords than our Sovereign lord, and thus 
for lack of punishment of these treasons, murders, robberies and felonies, 
the King’s true and faithful liege people and subjects, inhabiters and 
dwellers within the shires and places before rehearsed, cannot be in any 
manner of surety of their bodies or goods, neither yet lie in their own 
houses, but either to be murdered or taken or carried into Scotland and 
there ransomed, to their great destruction of body and goods, and utter 
impoverishing for ever, unless due and hasty remedy be had and found,” 
it is therefore provided that North and South Tynedale shall from thence- 
forth be gildable, and part of the shire of Northumberland, that no 
franchise shall stand good there, and the King’s writ shall run, and his 
officers and all their warrants be obeyed there as in every other part of 
that shire. Further, lessees of lands within the bounds are to enter into 
recognisances in two sureties to appear and answer all charges.

influence upon primitive thought. They press down 
upon the mind, and enclose it within barriers so that it 
can only act through these surroundings. Child-life is, 
in this respect, much the same as the life of primitive 
man. A child thinks and acts in terms of his nursery, 
his school, or his playground. Thus a memory of my 
own is to the point. When quite a child, probably 
about eight or nine years old, I was entrusted with 
the changing of a small cheque drawn by my father in 
a country town where we were staying. I had never 
seen a cheque before. I remember the ceremony of 
writing it and the care with which the necessary 
instructions were given to me, and I remember the 
amazement with which I received the golden sover- 
eigns. But my mind dwelt upon this strange thing 
called a cheque, and after a time I deliberately came to 
the conclusion that my father was allowed to get money 
for these cheques on condition only that he wrote them 
without a mistake and without a blot. The conception 
is absurd until we come to analyse the cause of it. My 
young life at that time was receiving its greatest im- 
pressions, its all-absorbing impressions, from my 
school exercises in writing. It was a copybook life for 
the time being, and when I turned to ask my question 
as to origins, as every human being has asked himself 
in turn, I could express myself only in copybook 
terms. It is so with the primitive mind. It can only 
express itself in the terms of its greatest impressions, 
and it is in this way that primitive animism, sym- 
pathetic magic and other conceptions obtained from 
the results of anthropological research, are to be found 
in much the same degree wherever humanity is found 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 187 
in primitive conditions. As Mr. Hickson puts it so 
well: ‘‘Just as the little black baby of the negro, the 
brown baby of the Malay, the yellow baby of the 
Chinaman, are in face and form, in gestures and 
habits, as well as in the first articulate sound they 
mutter, very much alike, so the mind of man, whether 
he be Aryan or Malay, Mongolian or Negrito, has, in 
the course of its evolution, passed through stages 
which are practically identical. In the intellectual 
childhood of mankind natural phenomena, or some 
other causes, of which we are at present ignorant, have 
induced thoughts, stories, legends, and myths, that in 
their essentials are identical among all the races of the 
world with which we are acquainted” ;! or to take one 
other example from the experience of travellers, Mr. 
Mitchell, speaking of the Australians, says: ‘‘I founda 
native still there, and on my advancing towards him 
with a twig he shook another twig at me, waving it 
over his head, and at the same time intimating with it 
that we must go back. He and the boy then threw up 
dust at us with their toes (cf 2 Sam. xvi. 13). 
These various expressions of hostility and defiance 
were too intelligible to be mistaken. The expressive 
pantomime of the man showed the identity of the 
human mind, however distinct the races or different the 
language.” 
This identity is shown in many other ways to have 
been operating, perhaps to be operating still, upon 
minds not attuned to the civilisation around them. 
The resistance of agriculturists to change is well

known.! The crooked ridges of the open-field system 
were believed to be necessary because they were sup- 
‘posed to deceive the devil,? while a superstitious dislike 
was entertained against winnowing machines, because 
they were supposed to interfere with the elements. 
This is nothing but a modern example of sympathetic 
magic produced by the introduction of the new 
machine. 
I need not go through the researches of the masters 
of anthropology to explain what the psychological 
evidence exactly amounts to, and the realms of primi- 
tive thought and experience which it connotes.‘ It 
will, however, be useful for the purpose of our present 
study, if we can find among the peasantry of our 
country (perchance from those districts where we have 
noted conditions under which primitive thought might 
retain a continuous hold) examples of belief or super- 
stition which belongs rather to psychological than to 
traditional influences. The interpretation of dreams, the 
belief in spirit apparitions, the practice of charms, all 
belong to this branch of our subject, though I shall 
illustrate the points I wish to bring out by reference to 
less common departments. 
It was only in the seventeenth century that a learned

4 The psychology of primitive races is now receiving scientific atten- 
tion, thanks chiefly to Dr. Haddon and the scholars who accompanied 
him upon his Torres Straits expedition in 1898. The volume of the 
memoirs of this expedition which relates to psychology has already been 
published, and students should consult it as an example of scientific

divine of the Church of England was shocked to hear 
one of his flock repeat the evidence of his pagan beliefs 
in language which is as explicit as it is amusing ; and I’ 
shall not be accused of trifling with religious suscepti- 
bilities if I quote a passage from a sermon delivered 
and printed in 1659—a passage which shows not a 
departure from Christianity either through ignorance 
or from the result of philosophic study or contemplation, 
but a sheer non-advance to Christianity, a passage 
which shows us an English pagan of the seventeenth 
century. 
“Let me tell you a story,” says the Reverend Mr. 
Pemble, ‘‘that I have heard from a reverend man out 
of the pulpit, a place where none should dare to tell a 
lye, of an old man above sixty, who lived and died in 
a parish where there had bin preaching almost all his 
time. ... On his deathbed, being questioned by a 
minister touching his faith and hope in God, you would 
wonder to hear what answer he made: being demanded 
what he thought of God, he answers that he was a good 
old man; and what of Christ, that he was a towardly 
youth ; and of his soule, that it was a great bone in his 
body ; and what should become of his soule after he 
was dead, that if he had done well he should be put into 
a pleasant green meadow.” + 
Of the four articles of this singular creed, the first 
two depict an absence of knowledge about the central 
features of Christian belief, the latter two denote the 
existence of knowledge about some belief not known to 
English scholars of that time. If it had so happened 
1 One is reminded of the famous Shakespearian emendation whereby 
Falstaff on his death-bed ‘‘ babbled o’ green fields.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  igo FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
that the Reverend Mr. Pemble had thought fit to tell 
his audience only of the first two articles of this creed, 
it would have been difficult to resist the suggestion 
that they presented us merely with an example of 
stupid, or, perhaps, impudent, blasphemy caused by 
the events of the day. But the negative nature of the 
first two items of the creed is counterbalanced by the 
positive nature of the second two items; and thus this 
example shows us the importance of considering 
evidence as to all phases of non-belief in Christianity. 
Passing on to the two items of positive belief, it is 
to be noted that the soul resident in the body in the 
shape of a bone is no part of the early European belief, 
but equates rather with the savage idea which identifies 
the soul with some material part of the body, such as 
the eyes, the heart, or the liver; and it is interesting to 
note in this connection that the backbone is considered 
by some savage races, e.g., the New Zealanders, as 
especially sacred because the soul or spiritual essence 
of man resides in the spinal marrow.! And there is a 
well-known incident in folk-tales which seems to owe 
its origin to this group of ideas. This is where the 
hero having been killed, one of his bones tells the 
secret of his death, and thus acts the part of the soul- 
ghost. 
In the pleasant green fields we trace the old faiths of 
the agricultural peasantry which, put into the words of 
Hesiod, tell us that ‘‘for them earth yields her in- 
1 Shortland, New Zealanders, 107. An Algonquin backbone story is 
quoted by MacCulloch, Childhood of Fiction, 92, and he says, ‘‘ the spine 
is held by many people to be the seat of life,” 93 and cf 111. Cf Frazer, 
Adonis, Attis, and Osiris, 277.

crease ; for them the oaks hold in their summits acorns, 
and in their midmost branches bees. The flocks bear 
for them their fleecy burdens ... . they live in 
unchanged happiness, and need not fly across the sea in 
impious ships ”’—faiths which are in striking contrast to 
the tribal warrior’s conception as set forth by the Saxon 
thane of King Eadwine of Northumbria. ‘‘ This life,” 
said this poetical thane, ‘‘is like the passage of a bird 
from the darkness without into a lighted hall where you, 
O King, are seated at supper, while storms, and rain, 
and snow rage abroad. The sparrow flying in at our 
door and straightway out at another is, while within, 
safe from the storm; but soon it vanishes into the dark- 
ness whence it came.” 
Such faiths as these, indeed, show us primitive ideas 
at their very roots. This seventeenth-century pagan 
depended upon himself for his faith, He worked out 
his own ideas as to the origin of soul and heaven and 
God and Christ. They were terms that had filtered 
down to him through the hard surroundings of his life, 
and he set to work to define them in the fashion of the 
primitive savage. We meet with other examples. Thus 
among the superstitions of Lancashire is one which 
tells us of the lingering belief in a long journey after 
death, when food is necessary to support the soul. A 
man having died of apoplexy, near Manchester, at a 
public dinner, one of the company was heard to remark : 
“‘ Well, poor Joe, God rest his soul! He has at least 
gone to his long rest wi’ a belly full o’ good meat, and 
that’s some consolation,” and perhaps a still more re- 
markable instance is that of the woman buried in 
Cuxton Church, near Rochester, who directed by her

will that the coffin was to have a lock and key, the key 
being placed in her dead hand, so that she might be 
able to release herself at pleasure.! 
These people simply did not understand civilised 
thought or civilised religion. To escape from the 
pressure of trying to understand they turned to think 
for themselves, and thinking for themselves merely 
brought them back to the standpoint of primitive 
thought. It could hardly be otherwise. The working 
of the human mind is on the same plane wherever and 
whenever it operates or has operated. The difference 
in results arises from the enlarged field of observation. 
When the Suffolk peasant set to work to account for 
the existence of stones on his field by asserting that the 
fields produced the stones, and for the origin of the so- 
called ‘‘pudding-stone” conglomerate, that it was a 
mother stone and the parent of the pebbles,? he was 
beginning a first treatise on geology; and when 
the Hampshire peasant attributes the origin of the 
tutsan berries to having germinated in the blood of 
slaughtered Danes,® other counties following the same 
thought, I am not at all sure that he is not beginning 
all over again the primitive conception of the origin 
of plants. 
This beginning shows the mark of the primitive 
mind, and that it was operating in a country dominated 
by scientific thought is the phenomenon which makes 
it so important to consider psychological conditions

among the problems of folklore. They account for 
some beliefs which may not contain elements of pure 
tradition. When the Mishmee Hill people of India 
affirm of a high white cliff at the foot of one of the hills 
that approaches the Burhampooter that it is the remains 
of the “marriage feast of Raja Sisopal with the 
daughter of the neighbouring king, named Bhismak, 
but she being stolen away by Krishna before the cere- 
mony was completed, the whole of the viands were left 
uneaten and have since become consolidated into their 
present form,”! we can understand that the belief is 
in strict accord with the primitive conditions of thought 
of the Mishmee people. Can we understand the same 
conditions of the parallel English belief concerning the 
stone circle known as ‘‘ Long Meg and her daughters, ” # 
and of. that at Stanton Drew ;* or of the allied beliefs 
in Scotland that a huge upright stone, Clach Macmeas, 
in Loth, a parish of Sutherlandshire, was hurled to 
the bottom of the glen from the top of Ben Uarie by 
a giant youth when he was only one month old ;* and 
in England that ‘‘the Hurlers,” in Cornwall, were 
once men engaged in the game of hurling, and were 
turned into stone for playing on the Lord’s Day; that 
the circle, known as ‘‘Nine Maidens,” were maidens 
turned into stone for dancing on the Lord’s Day ;° that

fifth century ;! and that the so-called snake stones found 
at Whitby were serpents turned into stones by the 
prayers of the Abbess Hilda.? These are only examples 
of the kind of beliefs entertained in all parts of the 
United Kingdom,’ and they seem based upon psycho- 
logical, rather than traditional conditions. 
The giant and the witch, or wizard, are terms applied 
to the unknown personal agent. ‘‘ The two standing 
stones in the neighbourhood of West Skeld are said to 
be the metamorphosis of two wizards or giants, who 
were on their way to plunder and murder the in- 
habitants of West Skeld; but not having calculated 
their time with sufficient accuracy, before they could 
accomplish their purpose, or retrace their steps to their 
dark abodes, the first rays of the morning sun appeared, 
and they were immediately transformed, and remain to 
the present time in the shape of two tall moss-grown 
stones of ten feet in height.”* This is paralleled by 
the Merionethshire example of a large drift of stones 
about midway up the Moelore in Llan Dwywe, 
which was believed to be due to a witch who ‘‘ was 
carrying her apron full of stones for some purpose 
to the top of the hill, and the string of the apron 
broke, and all the stones dropped on the spot, where 
they still remain under the name of Fedogaid-y- 
Widdon.”*® Giant and witch in these cases are generic 
terms by which the popular mind has conveyed a con- 
ception of the origin of these strange and remarkable

  PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 195 
monuments, whether natural or constructed by a long- 
forgotten people ; and we cannot doubt that such beliefs 
are generated by the peasantry of civilisation from a 
mental conception not far removed from that of the 
primitive savage. Neither their religion nor their edu- 
cation was concerned with such things, so the peasants 
turned to their own realm and created a myth of origins 
suitable to their limited range of knowledge. 
It may perhaps be urged that such beliefs as these 
are on the borderland of psychological and traditional 
influences. Witches and giants certainly belong to 
tradition, but on the other hand they are the common 
factors of the natural mind which readily attributes per- 
sonal origins to impersonal objects. I am inclined on 
the whole to attribute the beliefs attachable to the un- 
explained boulders or unknown monoliths to the eternal 
questionings in the minds of the uncultured peasants of 
uncivilised countries similar to those of the unadvanced 
savage. That the peasant of civilisation should con- 
fine his questionings to the by-products of his sur- 
roundings and not to the greater subjects which occupy

subjects have already been answered for him by the

     1 It is not worth while, perhaps, to pursue this part of our subject 
into further regions. It is to be sought for in innumerable pamphlets, 
such, for instance, as those relating to the Civil War. Beesley, Hist. of 
Banbury, 334, mentions one, the title of which I will quote: ‘“A great 
‘Wonder in Heaven shewing the late Apparitions and prodigious noyses 
lof War and Battels seen on Edge Hill neere Keinton,” and the contents 
re ‘‘ Certified under the hands of William Wood Esq and Justice for the 
Peace in the said Countie, Samuel Marshall, Preacher of God’s Word in 
einton, and other Persons of Qualitie.” The date is exactly three 
onths after the battle of Edgehill, ‘‘ London, printed for Thomas 
ackson, January 23rd, 1642-3.”

    There is a point, however, where psychological and 
traditional conditions are in natural conjunction, and 
I will just refer to this. That matters of legal im- 
portance should be preserved by the agency of tradition 
has already been shown to belong to that part of history 
for which there are no contemporary records, and its 
importance in this connection has been proved. Equally 
important from the psychological side is the fact that 
law is also preserved by tradition where people are 
unaccustomed to the use of writing, or by reason of 
their occupation have little use for writing. To illus- 
trate this, I will quote an excellent note preserved by 
a writer on Cornish superstitions. 
‘There is an old ‘ vulgar error’—that no man can swear 
as a witness in a court of law to any thing he has seen 
through glass. This is based upon the formerly universal 
use of blown glass for windows, in which glass the constant 
recurrence of the greenish, and barely more than semi- 
transparent bull’s eyes, so much distorted the view that it 
was unsafe for a spectator through glass to pledge his oath 
to what he saw going on outside. Now, through our present ; 
glass, this belief is relegated to the region of forgotten things, 
but nevertheless it has hold on Westcountry people still. I 
was, some years since, investigating the case of a derelict 
ship which had been found off the Scilly Islands, and towed 
by the pilots into a safe anchorage for the night. Next 
morning the pilots going out to complete their salvage, saw 
some men on board the derelict casting off the anchor rope 
by which they had secured her, but they distinctly declined 
to swear to the truth of what they had seen, and it turned 
out that they had seen through glass, by which they meant 
a telescope. In the same case I found that when these pilots 
(men intelligent much beyond the average, as all Scillonian: 
are) had, on boarding the derelict (which had, of course.
-P-A-G-E-241
  PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 197 
been deserted by her crew), found a living dog, they had 
deliberately thrown it overboard. They explained this act of 
cruelty to me by saying that a ship was not derelict if on 
board of her was found alive ‘man, woman, child, dog, or 
cat.’ And it turned out, on after-investigation, that these 
were the very words used in an obsolete Act of Parliament 
of one of the early Plantagenet kings, forgotten centuries 
ago by the English people, but borne in mind as a living fact 
by the Scillonians.”! 
In some special departments elementary psychologi- 
cal conditions operate in a considerable degree—operate 
to produce not waifs and strays of primitive thought 
and belief, but whole classes. Thus in the curious 
accretion of superstition around the objects connected 
with church worship, the same agencies are at work. 
The general characteristic of popular beliefs which 
originated with, or have grown up around the conse- 
crated objects of the Church, is that such objects are 
beneficent in their action when employed for any given 
purpose. Thus, as Henderson says of the North of 
England, ‘‘a belief in the efficacy of the sacred elements 
in the Eucharist for the cure of bodily disease is widely 
spread.” Silver rings, made from the offertory money, 
are very generally worn for the cure of epilepsy. Water 
that had been used in baptism was believed in West 
Scotland to have virtue to cure many distempers; it 
was a preventive against witchcraft, and eyes bathed 
with it would never see a ghost. Dalyell puts the 
evidence very succinctly. ‘‘Everything relative to 
sanctity was deemed a preservative. Hence the relics 
of saints, the touch of their clothes, of their tombs, and 
1 West of England Magazine, February, 1888,

even portions of structures consecrated to divine offices 
were a safeguard near the person. A white marble 
altar in the church of Iona, almost entire towards the 
close of the seventeenth century, had disappeared late 
in the eighteenth, from its demolition in fragments to 
avert shipwreck.” And so what has been consecrated, 
must not bedesecrated. In Leicestershire and Northamp- 
tonshire there is a superstitious idea that the removal 
or exhumation of a body after interment bodes death or 
some terrible calamity to the surviving members of the 
deceased’s family.? 
In the West of Ireland there were usually found 
upon the altars of the small missionary churches one or 
more oval stones, either natural waterwashed pebbles 
or artificially shaped and very smooth, and these were 
held in the highest veneration by the peasantry as 
having belonged to the founders of the churches, and were 
used for a variety of purposes, as the curing of diseases, 
taking oaths upon them, etc.? Similarly the using 
of any remains of destroyed churches for profane pur- 
poses was believed to bring misfortune,® while the land 
which once belonged to the church of St. Baramedan, 
in the parish of Kilbarrymeaden, county Waterford, 
‘has long been highly venerated by the common people, 
who attribute to it many surprising virtues.”* In 1849 
the people of Carrick were in the habit of carrying away

from the churchyard portions of the clay of a priest’s 
grave and using it as a cure for several diseases, and 
they also boiled the clay from the grave of Father 
O’Connor with milk and drank it.1 One of the super- 
stitious fancies of the Connemara folk in 1825 was 
credulity with respect to the gospels, as they are 
called, which ‘‘they wear round their neck as a 
charm against danger and disease. These are pre- 
pared by the priest, and sold by him at the price 
of two or three tenpennies. It is considered sacri- 
lege in the purchaser to part with them at any time, 
and it is believed that the charm proves of no effi- 
cacy to any but the individual for whose particular 
benefit the priest has blessed it. The charm is written 
on a scrap of paper and enclosed in a small cloth bag, 
marked on one side with the letters I. H. S. On one 
side of the paper is written the Lord’s Prayer, and after 
it a great number of initial letters.” ? 
Such examples could be multiplied indefinitely, but no 
folklorist has properly classified such beliefs and endea- 
voured to ascertain their place in the science of folk- 
lore.* It is clear they have arisen not from tradition, 
but from a new force acting on minds which were not 
yet free to receive new influences without going back 
to old methods of thought. 
How completely the sanctity of the church exercises 
a constant influence upon the minds of men, thus sub- 
stituting a new form of belief when older forms were

thrust on one side by the advance of the new religion, 
is perhaps best illustrated by a practice in early 
Christian times for giving sanctity to the oath. Among 
the Jews the altar in the Temple was resorted to by 
litigants in order that the oath might be taken in the 
presence of Yahveh himself, and ‘‘so powerful was 
the impression of this upon the Christian mind, that 
in the early ages of the Church there was a popular 
superstition that an oath taken in a Jewish synagogue 
was more binding and more efficient than anywhere 
else.”! In exactly the same way the altar of the 
Christian Church is used in popular belief after its use 
in Church ceremonial has been discontinued. Thus, to 
get in beneath the altar of St. Hilary Church, Angle- 
sey, by means of an open panel and then turn round 
and come out is to ensure life for the coming year,? and 
the white marble altar in Iona which has been entirely 
demolished by fragments of it being used to avert 
shipwreck has already been referred to.* These are 
cases where there has been a throwing back from the 
new religion to the objects connected with the old 
religion, and they are paralleled by the practice of 
Protestants appealing to the Roman Catholic priest- 
hood for protection against witchcraft, and of Non- 
conformists believing that the clergy of the Episcopal 
Church possess superior powers over evil spirits.*

  PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 201 
Psychological evidence is therefore important. One 
can never be quite sure to what extent civilised man 
is free from creating fresh myths in place of acquired 
scientific result, and to what extent this influences the 
production of primitive beliefs, or allows of the accept- 
ance of traditional belief on new ground. The great 
mass of traditional belief has come through the ages 
traditionally, that is, from parent to child, from neigh- 
bour to neighbour, from class to class, from locality to 
locality, generation after generation. Occasionally 
this main current of the traditional life of a people is 
swollen by small side streams from fresh psychological 
sources. Individual examples, such as those I have 
cited, have perhaps always been present, but their effect 
must have died away with the passing of those with 
whom they originated. There are, however, stronger 
effects than these, coming not from individuals, but 
from classes. Thus the votaries and enemies of witch- 
craft produced a more lasting effect. Witchcraft, as 
Dr. Karl Pearson, I think, conclusively proves, and as 
I have helped to prove,! is founded upon traditional 
belief and custom, but its remarkable revival in the 
Middle Ages was in the main a psychological pheno- 
menon. Traditional practices, traditional formule, 
and traditional beliefs are no doubt the elements of 
witchcraft, but it was not the force of tradition which 
produced the miserable doings of the Middle Ages and 
of the seventeenth century against witches. These 
were due to a psychological force, partly generated by 
the newly acquired power of the people to read the

Bible for themselves, and so to apply the witch stories 
of the Jews to neighbours of their own who possessed 
powers or peculiarities which they could not under- 
stand, and partly generated by the carrying on of tra- 
ditional practices by certain families or groups of 
persons who could only acquire knowledge of such 
practices by initiation or family teaching. Lawyers, 
magistrates, judges, nobles, and monarchs are con- 
cerned ‘with witchcraft. These are not minds which 
have been crushed by civilisation, but minds which 
have misunderstood it or have misused it. It is un- 
necessary, and it is of course impossible on this occa- 
sion to trace out the psychic issues which are contained 
in the facts of witchcraft, but it may be advisable to 
illustrate the point by one or two references. 
I will note a few modern examples of the belief in 
witchcraft :— 
“In 1879 extraordinary stories were current among the 
populace of Caergwrle. Mrs. Braithwaite supplied a Mrs. 
Williams with milk, but afterwards refused to serve her, and 
the cause was as follows: Mrs. Braithwaite had up to that 
time been very successful in churning her butter, but about 
a month ago the butter would not come. She tried every 
known agency ; she washed and dried her bats, but all to no 
purpose. The milk would not yield an ounce of butter. 
Under the circumstances she said Mrs, Williams had witched 
her. The neighbours believed it, and Mrs. Williams was 
generally called a witch. Hearing these reports, Mrs. 
Williams went to Mrs. Braithwaite to expostulate with her, 
when Mrs. Braithwaite said, ‘Out, witch! If you don’t 
leave here, I’ll shoot you.’ Mrs. Williams thereupon applied 
to the Caergwrle bench of magistrates for a protection order 
against Mrs. Braithwaite. She assured the Bench she was
-P-A-G-E-247
    
PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 203 
in danger, as every one believed she was a witch. The 
Clerk : What do they say is the reason? Applicant: Because 
she cannot churn the milk. Mr. Kryke: Do they see you 
riding a broomstick? Applicant (seriously): No, sir. The 
Bench instructed the police officer to caution Mrs, Braithwaite 
against repeating the threats.”? 
The next example is from Lancashire :— x 
**At the East Dereham Petty Sessions, William Bulwer, 
of Etling Green, was charged with assaulting Christiana 
Martins, a young girl, who resided near the Etling Green 
toll-bar. Complainant deposed that she was 18 years of 
age, and on Wednesday, the 2nd inst., the defendant came 
to her and abused her. The complainant, who looks scarce 
more than a child, repeated, despite the efforts of the magis- 
trates’ clerk to stop her, and without being in the least 
abashed, some of the worst language it was possible to 
conceive—conversation of the most gross description, alleged 
to have taken place between herself and the defendant. 
They appeared to have got from words to blows and, while 
trying to fasten the gate, the defendant hit her across the 
hand with a stick. She alleged that there was no cause 
for the abuse and the assault, so far as she knew, and in 
reply to rigid cross-examination as to the origin of the 
quarrel, adhered to this statement. Mrs. Susannah Gather- 
cole also corroborated the statement as to the assault, adding 
that the defendant said the complainant’s mother was a witch. 
Defendant then blazed forth in righteous indignation, and, 
when the witness said she knew no more about the origin of 
the quarrel, he said, ‘Mrs. Martins is an old witch, gentle- 
men, that is what she is, and she charmed me, and I got 
no sleep for her for three nights, and one night at half-past 
eleven o’clock, I got up because I could not sleep, and went 
out and found a ‘‘ walking toad” under a clod that had been 
dug up with a three-pronged fork. That is why I could not

rest; she is a bad old woman; she put this toad under 
there to charm me, and her daughter is just as bad, gentle- 
men. She would bewitch any one; she charmed me, and I 
got no rest day or night for her, till I found this ‘‘ walking 
toad” under the turf. She dug a hole and put it there to 
charm me, gentlemen, that is the truth. I got the toad out 
and put it in a cloth, and took it upstairs and showed it to my 
mother, and ‘“‘ throwed” it into the pit in the garden. She 
went round this here ‘‘ walking toad ” after she had buried it, 
and I could not rest by day or sleep by night till I found 
it. The Bench: Do you gotochurch? Defendant: Some- 
times I go to church, and sometimes to chapel, and some- 
times I don’t go nowhere. Her mother is bad enough to 
do anything ; and to go and put the ‘‘ walking toad” in the 
hole like that, for a man which never did nothing to her, she 
is not fit to live, gentlemen, to go and do such a thing; it 
is not as if I had done anything to her. She looks at 
lots of people, and I know she will do some one harm. 
The Chairman: Do you know this man, Superintendent 
Symons? Is he sane? Superintendent Symons: Yes, sir ; 
perfectly.” + 
In Somerset belief in witchcraft still lingers in nooks 
and corners of the west, as appears from a case brought 
before the magistrates of the Wiveliscombe division. 
“Sarah Smith, the wife of a marine store dealer, residing at 
Golden Hill, was for some time ill and confined to her bed. 
Finding that the local doctor could not cure her, she sent for 
a witch doctor of Taunton. He duly arrived by train on 
St. Thomas’s day. Smith inquired his charge, and was 
informed he usually charged 11s., remarking that unless he 
took it from the person affected his incantation would be of 
no avail. Smith then handed it to his wife, who gave it to 
the witch doctor, and he returned 1s. to her. He then 
1 Leigh Chronicle, 19th April, 1879. 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 205 
proceeded to foil the witch’s power over his patient by tap- 
ping her several times on the palm of her hand with his 
finger, telling her that every tap was a stab on the witch’s 
heart. This was followed by an incantation. He then gave 
her a parcel of herbs (which evidently consisted of dried bay 
leaves and peppermint), which she was to steep and drink. 
She was to send to a blacksmith’s shop and get a donkey’s 
shoe made, and nail it on her front door. He then de- 
parted.” 
Such examples as these may be added to from various 
parts of the country, but they do not compare with the 
terrible case at Clonmel, in county Tipperary, which 
occurred in 1895. The evidence showed that the 
husband, father, and mother of the victim, together with 
several other persons, were concerned in this matter, 
and one of the witnesses, Mary Simpson, stated ‘‘that 
on the night of March 14th she saw Cleary forcibly 
administer herbs to his wife, and when the woman did 
not answer when called upon in the name of the 
Trinity to say who she was, she was placed on the fire 
by Cleary and the others. Mrs. Cleary did not appear 
to be in her right senses. She was raving.”? The 
whole record of the trial is of the most amazing de- 
scription, pointing back to a system of belief which, 
if based upon traditional practices, has been fed by 
entirely modern influences. Such records as these 
stretch back through the ages, and almost every village, 
certainly every county in the United Kingdom, has its 
records of trials for witchcraft, in which clergy and 
layman, judge, jury, and victim play strange parts,

if we consider them as members of a civilised com- 
munity. Superstition which has been preserved by 
the folk as sacred to their old faiths, preserved by tradi- 
tion, has remained the cherished possession, generally 
in secret, of those who practise it. The belief in witch- 
craft is a different matter. Though it has traditional 
rites and practices it has been kept alive by a cruel and 
crude interpretation of its position among the faiths 
of the Bible, and it has thus received fresh life. 
The miserable records of witchcraft illustrate in a 
way no other subject can how the human mind, when 
untouched by the influences of advanced culture, has 
the tendency to revert to traditional culture, and they 
demonstrate how strongly embedded in human memory 
is the great mass of traditional culture. The outside 
civilisation, religious or scientific, has not penetrated 
far. Science has only just begun her great work, and 
religion has been spending most of her efforts in 
endeavouring to displace a set of beliefs which she calls 
superstition, by a set of superstitions which she calls 
revelation. Not only have the older faiths not been 
eradicated by this, but the older psychological con- 
ditions have not been made to disappear. The folk- 
lorist has to make note of this obviously significant 
fact, and must therefore deal with both sides of the 
question, the traditional and the psychological, and 
because by far the greater importance belongs to the 
former it does not do to neglect the importance, though 
the lesser importance, of the latter. 
It assists the student of tradition in many ways. 
People who will still explain for themselves in primi- 
tive fashion phenomena which they do not understand,

and who remain content with such primitive explana- 
tions instead of relying upon the discoveries of science, 
are just the people to retain with strong persistence the 
traditional beliefs and ideas which they obtained from 
their fathers, and to acquire other traditional beliefs 
and ideas which they obtain from neighbours. One 
often wonders at the ‘‘amazing toughness” of tradi- 
tion, and in the psychological conditions which have 
been indicated will be found one of the necessary ex- 
planations.

  CHAPTER IV 
ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
N dealing with the folklore of any country, it is 
important to note the general bearing of anthro- 
pological conditions. The earliest inhabitants, to 
whom part of the folklore belonged, and the later 
peoples, to whom part belonged, have both arrived at 
their ultimate point of settlement in the country where 
we discover their folklore after being in touch with 
many points of the world’s surface. They are both 
world-people as well as national people—they belonged 
to anthropology before they came under the dominion 
of history. This important fact is often or nearly 
always neglected. We are apt to treat of Greek and 
Roman and Briton, of Cretan, Scandinavian, and 
Russian, as bounded by the few thousands of years of 
life which have fixed them with their territorial names, 
and to ignore all that lies behind this historic period. 
There is, as a matter of fact, an immense period behind 
it, reckoned according to geological time in millions 
of years, and this period, longer in duration, more 
strenuous in its influences upon character and mind, 
containing more representatives in peoples, societies, 
and races than the later period, has affected the later 
period to a far greater extent than is generally con- 
208

     ceded or understood. We cannot understand the later 
period without knowing something of the earlier 
period. 
There is more than this; for the dominating political 
races occupying European countries to-day were, in 
most cases, preceded by a non-political people. Thus, 
if we turn to Britain for illustration, we find evidence 
of a people physically allied with a race which cannot 
be identified with Celt or Teuton,! philologically allied 
with a people which spoke a non-Aryan language,” 
archeologically allied with the prehistoric stone-circle 
and monolith builders,’ and we find custom, belief, and 
myth in Britain retaining traces of a culture which is 
not Celtic and not Teutonic, and which contains sur- 
vivals of the primitive system of totemism.t These 
four independent classes of evidence have to be com- 
bined if we would ascertain the true position they 
occupy in the history of Britain, and it is perfectly clear 
that, apart from general considerations, a direct appeal 
to anthropology is necessary to help out the deficiencies 
of both history and folklore. The questions involved in

and Jones, Welsh People, cap. i. and Appendix B on “ Pre-Aryan Syntax

8 Barrows, mounds, tumuli, stone circles, monoliths are generally 
admitted to belong to the Stone Age people before the Celts arrived, 
and when they are adequately investigated, as Mr. Arthur Evans has in- 
vestigated Stonehenge (Archeological Review, vol. ii. pp. 312-330), and 
the Rollright Stones (Folklore, vol. vi. pp. 5-51), the evidence of a pre- 
historic origin is unquestioned. 
4 I have worked out the evidence for this in the Archeological Review, 
vol, iii, pp. 217-242, 350-375, and though I do not endorse all I have 
written there, the main points are still, I think, good. 
P  
-P-A-G-E-254
  210 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
totemism alone compel us to this course. It is question- 
able whether there is any existing savage or barbaric 
people who are non-totemic in the sense of either not 
possessing the rudimentary beginnings of totemism, or 
not having once possessed a full system of totemism. 
Totemism, at one stage or another of its development, 
is, in fact, one of the universal elements of man’s life, 
and all consideration of its traces in civilised countries 
must begin with some conception of its origin. Its 
origin must refer back to conditions of human life 
which are also universal. Special circumstances, 
special peoples, special areas could not have produced 
totemism unless we proceed to the somewhat violent 
conclusion that beginning in one area it has spread 
therefrom to all areas. I know of no authority who 
advocates such a theory and no evidence in its favour. 
We are left therefore with the proposition that the 
origin of totemism must be sought for in some universal 
condition of human life at one of its very early stages, 
which would have produced a state of things from 
which would inevitably arise the beliefs, customs, and 
social organisations which are included under the term 
totemism. 
There is therefore ample ground for a consideration 
of anthropological conditions as part of the necessary 
equipment of the study of folklore as an historical science. 
Unfortunately, authorities are now greatly divided on 
several important questions in anthropology, and it is 
not possible to speak with even a reasonable degree of 
certainty on many things. This compels further re- 
search than the mere statement of the present position, 
and I find myself obliged even for my present limited

  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 2ir 
purpose to suggest many new points beyond the stage 
reached by present research. There is one advantage 
in this. It allows of a hypothesis by which to present 
the subject to the student, and a working hypothesis is 
always a great advantage where research is not founded 
entirely on actual observation by trained experts in the 
field. Where, therefore, I depart from the guidance of 
conclusions already arrived at by scholars in this 
department of research, it will be in order to substi- 
tute an opinion of my own which I think it is 
necessary to consider, and the whole study of the 
anthropological problems in their relation to folklore 
will assume the shape of a restatement of the entire 
case. 
I am aware that a subject of this magnitude is too 
weighty and far-reaching to be properly considered in 
a chapter of a book not devoted to the single purpose, 
but it is necessary to attempt a rough statement of the 
evidence, though it will take us somewhat beyond the 
ordinary domain of folklore; but, while dealing with 
the anthropological position at sufficient length to 
make a complicated subject clear, if I can do so, I 
shall limit both my arguments and the evidence in 
support of them to the narrowest limits. 
I 
Mr. Wallace, I think, supplies the dominant note of 
the anthropological position when he suggests, though 
in a strangely unsatisfactory terminology, that it is the

development.1. We must lay stress upon the impor- 
tant qualification ‘‘conscious.” It is conscious use 
of experience which is the great factor in man’s 
progress. It is the greatest possession of man in his 
beginning, and has remained his greatest possession 
ever since. His experience did not always lead him 
to the best paths of progress, but it has led him to 
progress. 
Even Mr. Wallace did not appreciate the full signifi- 
cance of this principle. The conscious adoption of a 
natural fact, of an observation from nature, or an 
assumed observation from nature, for social purposes, 
is an altogether different thing from the unconscious 
knowledge which man might have been possessed of, 
but which he never put to any use in his social develop- 
ment. Anthropologists must note not the natural facts 
known to later man or known to science, but the facts, 
or assumed facts, which early man consciously adopted 
for his purpose during the long period of his develop- 
ment from savage to civilised forms of life. The 
unconscious acts of mankind are of no use, or of very 
little use. It is only the conscious acts that will lead 
us along the lines of man’s development. Man did 
not begin to build up his social system with the 
scientific fact of blood kinship through father and 
mother, but he evolved a theory of social relationship 
which served his purpose until the fact of blood kin- 
ship supplied a better basis. At almost the first point 
of origin in savage society we see man acting con- 
sciously, and it is amongst his conscious acts that we

must place those traces of a sort of primitive legisla- 
tion which have been found. 
Now this being the basis of anthropological obser- 
vation, we have to apply it to the question of man’s 
earliest progress. It is at its base an economic 
question. Primitive economics dominated the move- 
ments and condition of early man in a far more 
thorough manner than modern economics affect civilisa- 
tion, and between the two systems lies the whole 
history of man. It reveals man adapting the social 
unit to the productive powers of its food supply, and 
developing towards the adaptation of the productive 
powers of food supply to the social unit. In the 
various stages that accompany this great change, there 
is no defined separation of peoples according to stages 
of culture, savage, barbaric, or civilised. There is 
nothing to suggest that all peoples do not come from 
one centre of human life. On the contrary, the 
evidence is strong that the primal stages in human 
evolution are traceable in all the culture stages, and, 
therefore, that they fit in with the general conclusions 
of anthropologists and naturalists as to man’s origin in 
one definite centre, and his gradual spreading out from 
that centre, 
I will take the chief conclusions arrived at in respect 
of this condition of birth at one centre and subsequent 
spreading out. Darwin has summarised the problem 
between the monogenists and polygenists in a manner 
which still ranks as a sufficient statement of the case, 
and his conclusion that ‘‘all the races of man are

descended from a single primitive stock”! is accepted 
by the most prominent naturalists,? and confirmed by 
recent discoveries, which go to prove that this primi- 
tive stock began in miocene or pliocene times in the 
Indo-Malaysian intertropical lands.* 
Anthropologists, who have been deeply interested 
in the controversy ranging round the origin of man, 
have in a remarkable manner neglected to take into 
full account the most significant phenomenon of spread- 
ing out. They either neglect it altogether, or they 
relegate it to so small a place in their argument as to 
become a practical neglect. They treat of man as if he 
were always in a stationary condition, and exclude the 
important condition of movement as an element in his 
development. Mr. Spencer’s general dictum that geo- 
logical changes and meteorological changes, as well as 
the consequent changes of flora and fauna, must have 
been causing over all parts of the earth perpetual emigra- 
tions and immigrations,® does not help much, because it 
refers to special and cataclysmic events. Lord Avebury, 
1 Descent of Man, i. cap. vii. 176. 
2 Cf Topinard’s Anthropology, part iii., ‘On the Origin of Man,” 
PP. 515-535, for the details of the various authorities ranged on the sides 
of monogenists and polygenists. 
3 Keane, Man, Past and Present, discusses the important evidence 
obtained by Dr. Dubois from Java, and Dr. Noetling from Upper Burma, 
pp. 5-8. It is only fair to that brilliant scholar, Dr. Latham, to point out 
that without the evidence before him to prove the point, he came to the 
same conclusion that the original home of man was ‘‘somewhere in 
intra-tropical Asia, and that it was the single locality of a single pair.” — 
Latham, Man and his Migrations, 248. 
4 The most recent example of this is Mr. Thomas’s extraordinary 
treatment of the evidence of migration in Australia. It produces in his 
mind ‘novel conditions,” but has effects which he cannot neglect, but 
which he strangely misinterprets. N. W. Thomas, Kinship Organisa- 
tions in Australia, 27-28. 5 Spencer, Principles of Sociology, i. 18.

though stating the true case, unfortunately contents 
himself at the end of his book on prehistoric man with 
a short summary of the evidence as to the equipment of 
primitive man in mental and social qualities when he 
began the great movement, and gives only a few lines 
to his conclusion that ‘‘there can be no doubt that he 
originally crept over the earth’s surface little by little, 
year by year, just, for instance, as the weeds of Europe 
are now gradually but surely creeping over the surface 
of Australia.” ? 
Mr. Keane is the first authority who thinks it appro- 
priate to commence his treatise on man with an examin- 
ation of the facts which show that ‘‘the world was 
peopled by migration from one centre by pleistocene 
man... who moved about like other migrating 
faunas, unconsciously, everywhere following the lines 
of least resistance, advancing or receding, and acting 
generally on blind impulse rather than of set pur- 
pose”’;? and it still remains with Dr. Latham to have 
formulated some fixed principles of the migratory move- 
ment in his admirable though, of course, wholly inade- 
quate summary of man and his migrations. I will 
quote the passage in full: ‘‘ So long as any continental 
extremities of the earth’s surface remained unoccupied 
—the stream (or rather the enlarging circle of migration) 
not having yet reached them—the Zrimary migration 
is going on; and when all have got their complement, 
the primary migration is over. During this primary 
migration, the relations of man, thus placed in move- 
ment and in the full, early and guiltless exercise of his 
high function of subduing the earth, are in conflict

with physical obstacles and with the resistance of the 
lower animals only. Unless, like Lot’s wife, he turn 
back upon the peopled parts behind him, he has no 
relations with his fellow-men—at least none arising out 
of the claim of previous occupancy. In other words, 
during the primary migration, the world that lay before 
our progenitors was either brute or inanimate. But 
before many generations have passed away, all becomes 
full to overflowing, so that men must enlarge their 
boundaries at the expense of their fellows. The migra- 
tions that now take place are secondary. They differ 
from the primary in many respects. They are slower, 
because the resistance is that of humanity to humanity, 
and they are violent, because dispossession is the object. 
They are partial, abortive, followed by the fusion of 
different populations, or followed by their extermina- 
tion as the case may be.”! This passage, written so 
long ago as 1841, is still applicable to the facts of 
modern science, and there is only to add to it that the 
migration of man from a common centre, where life 
was easy, to all parts of the world, where life has been 
difficult, must have been undertaken in order to meet 
some great necessity, and must have become possible 
by reason of some great force which man alone pos- 
sessed. The necessity was economic; the force was 
social development. If the movement has not been 
geographically ever forward, it has been ethnographic- 
ally constant.2 Movement always; sometimes the 
pressure has come from one direction, sometimes from 
1 Latham, Man and his Migrations, 155-6. 
® The ethnographic movement is a very definite fact in anthropological 
evidence, though it has been little noted. Thus ‘the Coles are evidently 
a good pioneering race, fond of new clearings and the luxuriant and

another ; sometimes it has caused compression and at 
other times expansion; sometimes it has sent humanity 
to inhabit regions that required generations of victims 
before it could hold its own. At all times the essential 
condition of life has been that of constant movement in 
face of antagonistic forces! In whatever form the 
movement has come about, movement of a very definite 
character has taken place over an immense period of 
time, and sufficient to cover practically the whole earth 
with descendants from the original human stock. This 
conclusion is enormously strengthened by the accumu- 
lating evidence for the world-wide area covered by the 
remains of man’s earliest weapon, the worked stone 
implement. It is everywhere. It is practically co- 
extensive with man’s wanderings, and the greatness of 
the territory it covers marks it off as another of the 
universal relics of man’s primitive life. Of no other 
easily raised crops of the virgin soil, and have constitutions that thrive 
on malaria, so it is perhaps in the best interest of humanity and cause of 
civilisation that they be kept moving by continued Aryan propulsion, 
Ever armed with bow, arrows, and pole-axe, they are prepared to do 
battle with the beasts of the forest, holding even the king of the forest, 
the ‘Bun Rajah,’ that is, the tiger, in little fear.’”—Col. Dalton in Journ, 
Asiatic Soc., Bengal, xxxiv. 9. 
1 Traditions of great migrations exist among most primitive races. 
Some of these contain unexpected corroboration from actual discoveries, 
Thus the natives of New Zealand had a tradition that their ancestors, 
when they arrived in their canoes some four centuries ago, buried some 
sacred things under a large tree, It is said that the tree was blown 
down in recent times and that the sacred things were discovered. Taplin 
records ‘‘a good specimen of the kind of migration which has taken 
place among the aborigines all over the continent” (Zhe Narrinyeri, p. 4); 
and similar evidence could be produced in almost every direction. 
Mr. Mathew in Eaglehawk and Crow deals with ‘‘the argument from 
mythology and tradition” as to the origin of the Australians ina very 
suggestive fashion (pp. 14-22). Stanley has preserved an African native 
tradition of local groups spreading out from the parent home (Zhrough 
the Dark Continent, i. 346). 
   
-P-A-G-E-262
  218 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
weapon or instrument or associated object can this be 
said. The bow and arrow are unknown to the Aus- 
tralians and other peoples; pottery is unknown to the 
Bushmen and other peoples ; the use of fire in cookery 
is not found among the South Sea Islanders, and is 
not claimed for other peoples.1 We can get behind 
the development of these and other arts and come upon 
the ruder people who had not arrived at the stage 
they represent. But we cannot get behind the worked 
flint. It must have been the chief material cause of 
man’s success in the migratory movement, and with 
the social development accompanying it must have 
made migration not only possible, but the only true 
method of meeting the earliest economic difficulties, 
It also provides us with the elements of a chronological 
basis. Behind palzolithic times there is an immensity 
of time when man struggled with his economic diffi- 
culties and spread out slowly and painfully. During 
palzolithic times the movement was more rapid and 
more general. Obstacles were overcome by palzo- 
lithic man becoming superior to his enemies by the 
use of weapons, and use of weapons caused, or at all 
events aided, the development of social institutions 
capable of bearing the new force of movement. 
1 I am aware this is disputed by O, Peschel—Races of Man, 137 et 
seg.—but I think the evidence is sufficient ; and it must be remembered 
that there is direct evidence of the most backward races not using the fire 
they possess for cooking, but always eating their animal food raw, as, for 
instance, the Semang people of the Malay Peninsula, (See Skeat and 
Blagden, Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula, i. 112.) The Andaman 
Islanders could not make fire, though they possessed and kept it alive. 
This shows that they must have borrowed it and did not previously 
possess it,—Quatrefages, The Pygmies, 108, Tylor, Early History a, 
Mankind, cap. ix., should be consulted.
-P-A-G-E-263
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 219 
These two factors of economic necessity and social 
development are of equal importance in man’s history, 
and they interlace at all points. They lead straight to 
the necessity for always taking count of the fact that 
man is primarily a migratory being, and that he has 
spread over the earth. Everywhere we find man. 
There is no habitable part of the world where he has 
not found a home. But we do not find him under 
equal conditions everywhere, and the different con- 
ditions afford evidence of the main lines of develop- 
ment. Roughly speaking, it may be put in this way. 
In the savage world the people appear as aborigines, 
that is to say, the first and only occupiers of the 
territory where they are located. In the barbaric world 
the condition of aboriginal settlement is tinged with 
the result of conquest, namely, the pushing out or 
absorption of the aboriginal folk in favour of a more 
powerful and conquering folk. In the political world, 
and in the political world only, there is not only the 
element of conquest, but the definite aim of conquest, 
which is to retain the aboriginal or conquered people 
as part of the political fabric necessary to the settle- 
ment of the conqueror, and at the same time to keep 
intact the superior position of the conqueror. In the 
savage world, society and religion are based upon 
locality; in the barbaric world there is the first sign 
of the element of kinship consciously used in the effort 
of conquest, which dies away gradually as successful 
settlement, by which conqueror and conquered become 
merged in one people, follows conquest; in the political 
world, and in the political world only, kinship is elevated 
into a necessary institution, is made sacred to the minds
-P-A-G-E-264
  220 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
of tribesmen, and becomes an essential part of the 
religion of the tribe in order to keep the organisation 
of the tribal conquerors intact and free from the 
perils of dissolution when conquerors and conquered 
become members of one political unit. The savage 
and barbaric worlds are the homes of the backward 
peoples, the non-advanced or fossilised types of early 
humanity. The political world is the domain for the 
most part of the Aryan-speaking people, and of the 
Semitic people, and of those people who in Egypt 
within the Mediterranean area, and in China in the 
eastern Asian area, have built up civilisations which 
have only recently come under scientific observation. 
These distinctions are not made by anthropologists 
asa rule, yet I cannot but think they are in the main 
the true distinctions which must be made if we are to 
arrive at any general conception of the progress of man 
from savagery to civilisation. The distinctions which 
seem to hold the field against those I have suggested, 
are those of hunter, pastoral, and agricultural. I say 
seem to hold the field, because they have never been 
scientifically worked out. They are stated in text- 
books and research work almost as an axiom of an- 
thropology, but their claim to this position is singu- 
larly weak and unsatisfactory, and has never been 
scientifically established. They are only economical 
distinctions, not social, and they do not properly 
express related stages. Hunting, cattle keeping, and 
agriculture are found in almost all stages of social 
evolution, and I, for one, deny that in the order they 
are generally given, they express anything approach- 
ing to accurate indication of the line of human pro-
-P-A-G-E-265
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 221 
gress. The distinctions I have suggested do not, of 
course, contain everything indicative of human pro- 
gress. They are the first broad outlines to be filled up 
by the details of special peoples, special areas, and 
special ages. They involve many sub-stages which 
need to be properly worked out, and for which a 
satisfactory terminology is required. In the meantime, 
as measuring-posts of man’s line of progress, they 
express the most important fact about man, namely, 
that his present enforced stationary condition has 
followed upon an enormous period of enforced move- 
ment. That movement has finally resulted in the 
presence of man everywhere on the earth’s surface. 
This has been followed by the continued moving of 
savage man within the limited areas to which he has 
been finally pushed; by the movement of barbaric 
man from one place of settlement to another place 
of settlement, again within limited areas; and by 
the movement of political man through countries and 
continents of vast extent, and the final overlordship 
of political man over savage and barbaric man whom 
he has subjected and used for his purpose of final 
settlement in the civilised form of settlement. It will 
be apparent from the terms I have used to express the 
three chief stages in man’s progress, that I give a 
special significance to the use of blood kinship as a 
social force, and in the sequel I think this special 
significance will be justified. 
No one can properly estimate the tremendous amount 
1 The term political is, I confess, a little awkward, owing to its 
specially modern use, but it is the only term which, in its early sense, 
expresses the stage of social development represented by a polity as 
distinct from a mere localisation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  222 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
of movement which preceded these later limitations to 
movement. Savageand barbaric races are now hemmed 
in by the forces of modern civilisation. This was not 
the case even a few hundred years ago, and though we 
cannot say when constant movement all over the world 
was stayed, we can form some idea of the comparatively 
late period when this took place by a contemplation of 
the very recent growth of the political civilisations 
known to history. At the most, this can only be 
reckoned at some ten thousand years. At the back of 
this short stretch of time, or of the successive periods 
at which the new civilisations have arisen, there are 
recollections of great movements and great migrations. 
Egypt, Babylonia, India, Persia, Greece, and Rome 
have preserved these recollections by tradition, and 
tradition has been largely confirmed by archeology. 
Celts and Teutons have preserved parallel traditions 
which are confirmed by history observed from without. 
These traditions and memorials of the migration period 
have not been scientifically examined in each case, but 
where scholars have touched upon them, great and un- 
expected results have been produced. 
1 It was one of the first efforts of the science of language to endeavour 
to trace out the original home of the so-called Aryas and their subsequent 
migrations. ‘‘ Emigration,” said Bunsen, ‘‘is the great agent in forming 
nations and languages” (Philosophy of Hist., i. 56); and Niebuhr, who 
has traced out most of the migrations of the Greek tribes, observes that 
“this migration of nations was formerly not mentioned anywhere” 
(Ane. Hist., ii. 212). Quite recently, Professor Flinders Petrie has worked 
at the question of European migrations in the Huxley lecture of 1907 
(Journ. Anthrop. Inst., xxxvi. 189-232), his valuable maps showing ‘‘ the 
movements of twenty of the principal peoples that entered Europe during 
the centuries of great movements that are best known to us” (204). In 
the meantime, the folklorist has much to do in this direction, and up to 
the present he has almost entirely ignored or misread the evidence. I 
do not know whether Mr. Nutt would still adhere to his conclusion that
-P-A-G-E-267
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 223 
There was time enough, before these late and special 
movements which led to civilisation, for man, in the 
course of peopling the earth, to be brought at various 
stages to a standstill, and such a change in his life- 
history would have its own special results. One of the 
most momentous of these results is the fossilisation of 
social and mental conditions. Man stationary, or 
movable by custom within restricted areas, would live 
under conditions which must have produced forms of 
culture different from those under which man lived 
when he was always able to penetrate, not by custom 
but by the force of circumstances, into the unknown 
domain of unoccupied territory; and the fossilisation 
of his culture at various stages of development, in 
accord with the various periods of his being brought 
to a standstill, would be the most important result.? 
the myth embodied in the Celtic expulsion-and-return formula is un- 
doubtedly solar (Folklore Record, iv. 42), but a restatement of Mr. 
Nutt’s careful and elaborate analysis would lead me to trace the myth to 
the migration period of Aryan history, just as I agree with von Ihering 
that the ver sacrum of the Romans is a rite continued from the migration 
period to express in religious formule, and on emergency to again carry 
out, the ancient practice of sending forth from an overstocked centre 
sufficient of the tribesmen and tribeswomen to leave those who remained 
economically well-conditioned (Zhe Evolution of the Aryan, 249-290). 
Pheidon’s law at Corinth, alluded to by Aristotle (Pol., ii. cap, vi.), could 
only be carried out by a sending out of the surplus. See also Aristotle, 
Pol,, ii. cap. xii.; and Newman’s note to the first reference, quoting similar 
laws elsewhere. Both the ‘‘junior-right” traditions and customs take us 
back to the same conditions. The occupation of fresh territories is an 
observable feature of the Russian mir (Wallace, Russia, i. 255; Laveleye 
Primitive Property, 34), and Mr. Chadwick has recently called atten- 
tion to the corresponding Scandinavian evidence (Origin of the English 
Nation, 334). 
1 Mr. J. R. Logan long ago pointed out that ‘‘ the further we go back, 
we find ethnic characteristics more uniform,” and further concluded that 
certain facts observed by himself ‘‘lead to the inference that the Archaic 
world was connected.”—Journ. Indian Archipelago, iv. 290, 291.
-P-A-G-E-268
  224 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
‘Whenever man was compelled to move onward the social 
forces which were demanded of him, as he proceeded 
from point to point, must have been quite different from 
those which he could have adopted if he had been allowed 
to stay in areas which suited him, if he could have 
selected his settlement grounds and awaited events. 
The calmness of the latter methods would perhaps 
have led to the unconscious development of social 
forms ; the roughness of the actual method of constant 
movement led to the conscious adoption of social forms 
which has altered man’s history. These considerations 
bring us to the conclusion that it is during the period 
of migratory movement that man has developed the 
social and religious elements with which the anthro- 
pologist finds him endowed, when at last in modern 
days he has been brought within the ken of scientific 
observation, and that therefore it is as a migratory not 
a stationary organism that the evolution of human 
society has to be studied, aided by the fact that enforced 
stationary conditions have produced in the savage world 
examples of perhaps the most remote as well as the 
more recent types of primitive humanity. 
This last possibility, however, is not admitted by 
the best authorities. They endeavour to use biological 
methods in order to get behind existing savagery for 
the earliest period of human savagery. Darwin is not 
satisfied with the evidence as to promiscuity, strong 
as it appeared to him to be, and he pronounced it to 
be ‘‘extremely improbable” in a state of nature, and 
falls back upon the evidence of the rudimentary stages 
of human existence, there being, as among the gorillas, 
but one adult male in the band, and ‘‘ when the young
-P-A-G-E-269
ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 225 
male grows up, a contest takes place for the mastery, 
and the strongest, by killing and driving out the others, 
establishes himself as the head of the community.”! 
Mr. McLennan nowhere states the evidence for his first 
stage of human society—the primitive horde without 
any ideas of kinship, and based upon a fellowship of 
common interests and dangers*—but arrives at it by 
argument deduced from the conditions of later stages 
of development, and from the necessary suppositions 
as to the pre-existing stage which must have led to the 
later. Mr. Westermarck leads us straight to the evi- 
dence of the lower animals, from which he arrives at 
the small groups of humans headed by the male, and 
provides us with the theory of a human pairing 
season. Mr. Morgan claims that no exemplification 
of mankind in his assumed lower status of savagery 
remained to the historical period,* presumably meaning 
the anthropo-historical period. And finally, Mr. Lang 
definitely claims that conjecture, and conjecture alone, 
remains as the means of getting back to the earliest 
human origins.® 
There is great danger in relying too closely upon 
conjecture. We shall be repeating in anthropology 
what the analytical jurists accomplished in law and 
jurisprudence, and it will then soon become necessary 
to do for anthropology what Sir Henry Maine did for 
comparative jurisprudence, namely, demonstrate that 
the analytical method does not take us back to human

               origins, but to highly developed systems of society. 
Law, in the hands of the analytical jurists, is merely 
one part of the machinery of modern government. 
Social beginnings in the hands of conjectural anthro- 
pologists are merely abstractions with the whole history 
of man put on one side. Mr. Lang in leading the way 
towards the analytical method in anthropology has 
avoided many of its pitfalls, but his disciples are not 
so successful. Thus, when Mr. Thomas declares that 
“custom which has among them [primitive peoples] 
far more power than law among us, determines whether 
a man is of kin to his mother and her relatives alone, 
or to his father and father’s relatives, or whether both 
sets of relatives are alike of kin to them,”? he is neg- 
lecting the whole significance and range of custom. 
His statement is true analytically, but it is not true 
anthropologically until we have ascertained what this 
custom to which he refers really is, whence it is de- 
rived, how it has obtained its force, what is its range 
of action, how it operates in differentiating among the 
various groups of mankind—in a word, what is the 
human history associated with this custom. 
We must, however, at certain points in anthro- 
pological inquiry have recourse to the conjectural 
method. Its value lies in the fact that it states, and 
states clearly, the issue which is before us, and it is 
always possible to take up the conjectural position 
and endeavour to ascertain whether the neglected 
facts of human history which it expresses can be 
recovered. Its danger lies in the neglect of certain 
anthropological principles which can only be noted 
1N, W. Thomas, Kinship Organisation in Australia, 4.
-P-A-G-E-271
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 227 
from definite examples, and the significance of which 
can only be discovered by the handling of definite 
examples. I will refer to one or two of the principles 
which I have in mind. Thus, it is necessary to dis- 
tinguish between what is a practice and what isa rule. 
A practice precedes a rule. A practice incidental to 
one stage of society must not be confused with a rule, 
similar to the practice, obtaining in a different stage of 
society. Again, it must be borne in mind that identity 
of practice is no certain evidence of parallel stages of 
culture, and already it has been pointed out that iden- 
tical practices do not always come from the same 
causes. Thirdly, it has to be borne in mind that 
primitive peoples specialise in certain directions to an 
extreme extent, and correspondingly cause neglect in 
other directions. The normal, therefore, has to give 
way to the special, and it is the degree of specialisa- 
tion and the degree of neglect which are measuring 
factors of progress; in other words, it is the conscious 
adoption of certain rules of life with which we alone 
have to do. 
These principles are apt to be wholly neglected, and, 
indeed, the last-mentioned element in the evolution of 
human society does not enter into the calculations of 
analytical anthropologists. They provide for the normal 
according to scientific ideas of what the normal is. 
They either neglect or openly reject what cannot be 
called abnormal, because it appears everywhere, but 
which they are inclined to treat as abnormal because it 
does not fit into their accepted lines of development. 
That which I have ventured to term specialisation and 
neglect is a great and important feature in anthro-

      pology. It obtains everywhere in more or less degree, 
and accounts for some of the apparently unaccountable 
facts in savage society, where we are frequently en- 
countered by a comparatively high degree of culture 
associated with a cruel and debasing system of rites 
and practices which belong the lowest savagery. 
Dr. Haddon has usefully suggested the term ‘‘differ- 
ential evolution” for this phenomenon in the culture 
history of man,‘ and as I find myself in entire agree- 
ment with this distinguished anthropologist as to the 
facts? which call for a special terminology, I gladly 
adopt his valuable suggestion 
It is advisable to explain this phenomenon by 
reference to examples, and I will take the point of 
specialisation first. Even where industrial arts have 
advanced far beyond the primitive stage we are con- 
sidering, we have the case of the Ahts, with whom 
‘though living only a few miles apart, the tribes 
practise different arts and have apparently distinct 
tribal characteristics. One tribe is skilful in shaping 
canoes, another in painting boards for ornamental 
work, or making ornaments for the person, or instru- 
ments for hunting and fishing. Individuals as a rule 
keep to the arts for which their tribe has some repute, 
and do not care to acquire those arts in which other 
tribes excel. There seems to be among all the tribes} 
in the island a sort of recognised tribal monopoly in| 
certain articles produced, or that have been lon

manufactured in their own district. For instance, a 
tribe that does not grow potatoes, or make a par- 
ticular kind of mat, will go a long way year after 
year to barter for those articles, which if they liked they 
themselves could easily produce or manufacture.”? 
The remarkable case of the Todas specialising in 
cattle rearing and dairy farming is another example. 
Other people, both higher and lower in civilisation 
than the Todas, keep cattle and know the value of 
milk, but it is reserved for the Todas alone to have 
used this particular economic basis of their existence 
as the basis also of their social formation and their 
religious life.? The result is that they neglect other 
forms of social existence. They are not totemists, 
though perhaps they have the undeveloped germs of 
totemistic beliefs.* Their classificatory system of re- 
lationship makes their actual kinship scarcely recog- 
nisable; they ‘‘have very definite restrictions on the 
freedom of individuals to marry,” and have a two- 
class endogamous division, but their marriage rite is 
merely the selection of nominal fathers for their 
children. Throughout the careful study which we 
now possess, thanks to Dr. Rivers, of this people, 
there is the dominant note of dairy economy super- 
imposing itself upon all else, and even religion seems 
to be in a state of decadence.’ I do not know that 
1 Sproat’s Scenes and Studies of Savage Life, 19. The use of the 
term ‘‘ tribe” in this quotation is, of course, descriptive only. There is 
no tribal constitution among the Ahts, and “group” would have been 
the preferable term.

anywhere else could be found a stronger example of the 
results of extreme specialisation upon the social and 
mental condition of a people. Asarule such specialisa- 
tion does not extend to a whole people, but rather 
to sections, as, for instance, among the Gold Coast 
tribes of Africa who ‘‘transmit the secret of their 
skill from father to son and keep the corporation to 
which they belong up to a due degree of closeness by 
avoiding intermarriage with any of the more un- 
skilled labourers,”! and Dr. Bucher, who has worked 
out many of the earliest conditions of primitive 
economics, concludes that it may be safely claimed 
that every ‘‘tribe displays some favourite form of 
industrial activity in which its members surpass the 
other tribes.”? This rule extends to the lowest type 
of man, as, for instance, among the Australians. Each 
tribe of the Narrinyeri, says Taplin, have been 
accustomed to make those articles which their tract 
of country enabled them to produce most easily ; one 
tribe will make weapons, another mats, and a third 
nets, and then they barter them one with another.*® 
The evidence for industrial evolution is full of cases 
such as these, and they are extremely important to 
note, because it is not the mere existence of particular 
customs or particular beliefs among different peoples 
which is the factor to take into account, but the use or 
non-use, and the extent of the use or non-use, to 
which the particular customs or beliefs are put in each

case.! Let me turn from the phenomenon of over- 
specialisation to that of neglect, and for this purpose I 
will take the simple fact of blood kinship. Existing 
obviously everywhere through the mother, and not 
obviously but admittedly through the father among 
most primitive peoples, there are examples where both 
maternal kinship and paternal kinship are neglected 
factors in the construction of the social group. The 
Nahals of Khandesh, for instance, neglect kinship 
altogether, and exist perfectly wild among the moun- 
tains, subsisting chiefly on roots, fruits, and berries, 
though the children during infancy accompany the 
mother in her unattached freedom from male control,? 
just as Herodotos describes the condition of the 
Auseans ‘‘ before the Hellenes were settled near 
them.”® Similarly, among many primitive peoples, 
kinship with the mother is recognised while kinship 
with the father is purposely neglected as a social 
factor. Thus, among the Khasia Hill people, the 
husband visits his wife occasionally in her own home, 
where ‘‘he seems merely entertained to continue the 
family to which his wife belongs.”* This statement, 
so peculiarly appropriate to my purpose, is not merely 
an accident of language. With the people allied to 
the Khasis, namely, the Syntengs and the people of 
Maoshai, ‘‘the husband does not go and live in his 
mother-in-law’s house; he only visits her there. In 
Jowai, the husband came to his mother-in-law’s house 
only after dark,” and the explanation of the latest

authority is that among these people ‘‘the man is 
nobody . . . if he be a husband he is looked upon 
merely as w shong kha, a begetter.”? 
The neglect of maternal and paternal kinship respec- 
tively in these two cases is obvious. They are recog- 
nised physically. But they are not used as part of the 
fabric of social institutions. Physical motherhood or 
fatherhood is nothing to these people, and one must 
learn to understand that there is wide difference be- 
tween the mere physical fact of having a mother and 
father, and the political fact of using this kinship for 
social organisation. Savages who have not learnt the 
political significance have but the scantiest apprecia- 
tion of the physical fact. The Australians, for instance, 
have no term to express the relationship between 
mother and child. This is because the physical fact is 
of no significance, and not as Mr. Thomas thinks be- 
cause of the meagreness of the language.? Our field 
anthropologists do not quite understand the savage in 
this respect. It is of no use preparing a genealogical 
tree on the basis of civilised knowledge of genealogy 
if such a document is beyond the ken of the people to 
whom it relates. The information for it may be 
correctly collected, but if the whole structure is not 
within the compass of savage thought it is a mislead- 
ing anthropological document. It is of no use translat- 
ing a native term as ‘‘ father,” if father did not mean 
to the savage what it means to us. It might mean 
something so very different. With us, fatherhood 
connotes a definite individual with all sorts of social,

  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 233 
economical, and political associations, but what does it 
mean to the savage? It may mean physical fatherhood 
and nothing more, and physical fatherhood may be a 
fact of the veriest insignificance. It may mean social 
fatherhood, where all men of a certain status are fathers 
to all children of the complementary status, and social 
fatherhood thus becomes much more than we can under- 
stand by the term father. 
We cannot ignore the evidence which over-specialisa- 
tion in one direction and neglect in other directions 
supply to anthropology. It shows us that human 
societies cannot always be measured in the scale of 
culture by the most apparent of the social elements 
contained in them. The cannibalism of the Fijians, 
the art products of the Maori, the totemism of the 
Australian blacks, do not express all that makes up the 
culture of these people, although it too often happens 
that they are made to do duty for the several estimates 
of culture progress. It follows that a survey of the 
different: human societies might reveal examples of the 
possible lowest in the scale as well as various advances 
from the lowest; or in lieu of whole societies in the 
lowest scale, there’ might be revealed unexceptional 
examples of the possible lowest elements of culture 
within societies not wholly in the lowest scale. It will 
be seen how valuable an asset this must be in anthropo- 
logical research. It justifies those who assert that exist- 
ing savagery or existing survival will supply evidence 
of man at the very earliest stages of existence. It is the 
root idea of Dr. Tylor’s method of research, and it is an 
essential feature in the science of folklore. 
Evidence of this nature, however, needs to be ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  234 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
haustively collected, and to be subjected to the most 
careful examination, as otherwise it may be used for 
the merest a priori argument of the most mischievous 
and inconclusive description. It involves consideration 
of whole human groups rather than of particular sec- 
tions of each human group, of the whole corpus of 
social, religious, and economical elements residing in 
each human group rather than of the separated items. 
Each human group, having its specialised and dormant 
elements, must be treated as an organism and not as 
a bundle of separable items, each one of which the 
student may use or let alone as he desires. That 
which is anthropological evidence is the indivisible 
organism, and whenever, for convenience of treatment 
and considerations of space, particular elements only 
are used in evidence, they must be qualified, and the 
use to which they are provisionally put for scientific 
purposes must be checked, by the associated elements 
with which the particular elements are connected. 
The human groups thus called upon to surrender 
their contributions to the history of man are of 
various formations, and consist of various kinds 
of social units. There is no one term which can 
properly be applied to all, and it will have been noted 
that I have carefully avoided giving the human groups 
hitherto dealt with any particular name, and only 
under protest have I admitted the terms used by 
the authorities I have quoted. I think the term 
“tribe” is not applicable to savage society, for it 
is used to denote peoples in all degrees of social 
evolution, and merely stands for the group which is 
known by a given name, or roams over a given district.
-P-A-G-E-279
    ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 235 
But the use of this term is not so productive of harm 
as the use of the term ‘‘family,” because of the 
universal application of this term to the smallest social 
unit of the civilised world, and because of the funda- 
mental difference of structure of the units which 
roughly answer to the definition of family in various 
parts of the world. It is no use in scientific matters to 
use terms of inexact reference. As much as almost 
anything else it has led to false conclusions as to the 
evolution of the family, conclusions which seem to 
entangle even the best authorities in a mass of contra- 
dictions. I cannot think of a family group in savagery 
with father, mother, sons, and daughters, all delight- 
fully known to each other, in terms which also belong 
to the civilised family, and still less can I think of these 
terms being used to take in the extended grouping of 
local kinships. One of our greatest difficulties, indeed, 
is the indiscriminate use of kinship terms by our descrip- 
tive authorities. We are never quite sure whether the 
physical relationships included in them convey anything 
whatever to the savage. If he knows of the physical 
fact, he does not use it politically, for blood kinship as 
a political force is late, not early, and the early tie was 
dependent upon quite other circumstances. Over and 
over again it will be found stated by established 
authorities that the family was the primal unit, the 
grouped families forming the larger clan, the grouped 
clans forming the larger tribe. This is Sir Henry 
Maine’s famous formula, and it is the basis of his 
investigation into early law and custom.! It is founded 
1 Fustel de Coulange’s Cité Antique, cap. xiv. and xv., is, however, 
the most exaggerated example of this point of view.
-P-A-G-E-280
236 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
upon the false conception of the family in early history, 
and upon a too narrow interpretation of the stages of 
evolution. When we are dealing with savage society, 
the terms family and tribe do not connote the same 
institution as when we are dealing with higher forms 
of civilisation. There is something roughly corre- 
sponding to these groupings in both systems, but they 
do not actually equate. When we pass to the Semitic 
and the Aryan-speaking peoples, both the family and 
tribe have assumed a definite place in the polity of the 
races which is not to be found outside these peoples. 
So strongly has the family impressed itself upon the 
thought of the age that students of man in his earliest 
ages are found stating that ‘‘the family is the most 
ancient and the most sacred of human institutions.”! 
This proposition, however, is not only denied by other 
authorities, as, for instance, Mr. Jevons, who affirms 
that ‘‘the family is a comparatively late institution in 
the history of society,”® but it rests upon the merely 
analytical basis of research, separated entirely from those 
facts of man’s history which are discoverable by the 
means just now suggested. One is, of course, quite 
prepared to find the family among civilisations older 
than the Indo-European, and yet to find that it is a 
comparatively late institution among Indo-European 
peoples. As a matter of fact, this is the case; for the 
two kinds of family, the family as seen in savage society 
1 Lang, Social Origins, 1. The latest exponent of anthropological 
principles affirms that ‘the family which exists in the lower stages of 
culture, though it is overshadowed by the other social phenomena, has 
persisted through all the manifold revolutions of society.’.—N. W. 
Thomas, Kinship Organisations in Australia, 1. 
2 Jevons’ Jntrod. to Hist. of Religion, 195.
-P-A-G-E-281
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 237 
and the family as it appears among the antiquities of 
the Indo-European people, are totally distinct in origin, 
in compass, and in force ; while welded between the two 
kinds of family is the whole institution of the tribe. 
It is no use introducing the theory adopted by Grote, 
Niebuhr, Mommsen, Thirlwall, Maine, and other au- 
thorities who have studied the legal antiquities of 
classical times, that the tribe is the aggregate of original 
family units. Later on I shall show that this cannot be 
the case. The larger kinship of the tribe is a primary 
unit of ancient society, which thrusts itself between the 
savage family and the civilised family, showing that the 
two types are separated by a long period of history 
during which the family did not exist. 
It has taken me some time to explain these points in 
anthropological science, which appear to me not to have 
received proper consideration at the hands of the 
masters of the science, but which are essential factors 
in the history of man and are necessary to a due con- 
sideration of the position occupied by folklore. The 
chief results obtained are :— 
(1) Migratory man would deposit his most rudimen- 
tary social type not at the point of starting his 
migration, but at the furthest point therefrom. 
(2) Custom due to the migratory period would con- 
tinue after real migratory movement had ceased, 
and from this body of custom would be derived 
all later forms of social custom. 
(3) Non-kinship groups are more rudimentary than 
kinship groups, and are still observable in 
savage anthropology.
-P-A-G-E-282
  238 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
(4) Anthropological evidence must be based upon the 
whole of the characteristics of human groups, 
not upon special characteristics singled out for 
the purpose of research. 
It is with these results we have to work. They 
will help us to see how far the facts of anthropology, 
which begin far behind the historical world, have to do 
with the problems presented by folklore as a science 
having to deal with the historical world. 
Il 
We may now inquire where anthropology and folklore 
meet. It is significant in this connection that in order to 
reach back to the earliest ages of man, our first appeal 
seems to be to folklore. The appeal at present does not 
lead us far perhaps, but it certainly acts as a finger post 
in the inquiry, for Dr. Kollmann, rejecting the evi- 
dence of the Java Pithecanthropus erectus as the earliest 
palzontological evidence of man, advances the opinion 
that the direct antecedents of man should not be sought 
among the species of anthropoid apes of great height 
and with flat skulls, but much further back in the 
zoological scale, in the small monkeys with pointed 
skulls ; from which, he believes, were developed the 
human pygmy races of prehistoric ages with pointed 
skulls, and from these pygmy races finally developed 
the human race of historic times. And he relies upon 
folklore for one part of his evidence, for it is this descent 
of man, he thinks, which explains the persistency with 
which mythology and folklore allude to the subject of 
pygmy people, as well as the relative frequency with
-P-A-G-E-283
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 239 
which recently the fossils of small human beings 
belonging to prehistoric times have been discovered. 
It must not be forgotten, too, that this remote period 
is found in another class of tradition, namely, that to 
which Dr. Tylor refers as containing the memory of 
the huge animals of the quaternary period.” 
It must be confessed that we do not get far with this 
evidence alone. If it proves that the true starting point 
is to be found in folklore, it also proves that folklore 
alone is not capable of working through the problem. 
Anthropology must aid here, and I will suggest the 
lines on which it appears to me it does this. 
Our first effort must be made by the evidence sug- 
gested by the conjectural method. This leads us to 
small human groups, each headed by a male who drives 
out all other males and himself remains with his females 
and his children. Sexual selection thus acts with primi- 
tive economics * in keeping the earliest groups small in 
numbers, and creating a spreading out from these 
groups of the males cast out. We have male supremacy 
in its crudest form accompanied by an enforced male 
celibacy, so far as the group in which the males are 
born is concerned, on the part of those who survive 
the struggle for supremacy and wander forth on their 
own account. Marking the stages from point to point, 
in order to arrive at a systematic method of stating the 
complex problem presented by the subject we are in-

396; Gould, Mythical Monsters. 
8 Mr. Westermarck has collected excellent evidence as to the economic 
influences upon savage society (Hist. of Human Marriage, 39-49), and 
we may quite properly assume the same conditions for earliest man. 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
240 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
vestigating, we can project from this earliest condition 
of man’s life two important elements of social evolu- 
tion, namely— 
(a) Younger men are celibate within the natural groups 
of human society, or are driven out therefrom. 
(2) Men thus driven out will seek mates on their own 
account, and will secure them partly from the 
original group as far as they are permitted or 
are successful in their attempts, and partly by 
capture from other local groups. 
The first of these elements strongly emphasises the 
migratory character of the earliest human groups. The 
second shows how each group is relieved of the incubus 
of too great a number for the economic conditions by 
the double process of sending forth its young males, and 
of its younger females being captured by successful 
marauders. 
Let us take a fuller note of what the conditions of 
such a life might be. There is no tie of kinship 
operating as a social force within the groups; there is 
the unquestioned condition of hostility surrounding 
each group, and there is the enforced practice of pro- 
viding mates by capture. Of these three conditions the 
most significant is undoubtedly the absence of the 
kinship tie. If then we use this as the basis for group- 
ing the earliest examples of social organisation, we 
proceed to inquire whether there are any examples of 
kinless society in anthropological evidence. 
Following up the clue supplied by folklore, we may 
see whether the pygmy people of anthropological ob- 
servation answer in any way to those conjectural con-
-P-A-G-E-285
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 241 
ditions! I think they do. Thus, we find that the 
pygmy people are in all cases on the extreme confines 
of the world’s occupation ground; that they occupy 
the territory to which they have been pushed, not that 
which they have chosen. As the most primitive repre- 
sentatives, they are the last outposts of the migratory 
movements. Dr. Beke has preserved an account of 
the pygmies which even in its terminology assists in 
their identification as a type of the remotest stages of 
social existence. Dr. Beke obtained certain informa- 
tion about the countries south-west of Abyssinia, from 
which Latham quotes the following :— 
“‘The people of Doko, both men and women, are said to 
be no taller than boys nine or ten years old. They never 
exceed that height even in the most advanced age. They go 
quite naked; their principal foods are ants, snakes, mice, and 
other things which commonly are not used as food... . 
They also climb trees with great skill to fetch down the 
fruits, and in doing this they stretch their hands downwards 
and their legs upwards. . . . They live mixed together ; 
men and women unite and separate as they please. . ... The 
mother suckles the child only as long as she is unable to find 
ants and snakes for its food ; she abandons it as soon as it 
can get its food by itself. No rank or order exists among 
the Dokos. Nobody orders, nobody obeys, nobody defends 
the country, nobody cares for the welfare of the nation.’”?

is given by Mr, W. A. Reed in his useful Megritos of Zambales, 13-22.

cautious observer, and I have consulted all his contributions to the 
Journal of the Geographical Society (vol. xiii.) and have found no sign 
of his retraction of the evidence. His correspondence in the Literary 
Gazette of 1843, p. 852, discusses the question of the Dokos being 
pygmies, but he adheres to his information as to the absence of social 
structure being correct.

This evidence is confirmed in many directions. It 
coincides with the account by Herodotos of the expedi- 
tion from Libya which met with a pygmy race,’ and with 
a seventeenth-century account of a Dutch expedition to 
the north from the south, who “‘found a tribe of people 
very low in stature and very lean, entirely savage, with- 
out huts, cattle, or anything in the world except their 
lands and wild game.”? Captain Burrows’ account of 
the Congoland pygmies agrees in all essentials, and 
he particularly notes that they ‘‘have no ties of family 
affection such as those of mother to son or sister to 
brother, and seem to be wanting in all social qualities” ; 
they have no religion and no fetich rites; no burial 
ceremony and no mourning for the dead; in short, he 
adds, ‘‘they are to my thinking the closest link with 
the original Darwinian anthropoid ape extant.”* The 
evidence of the African pygmy people everywhere con- 
firms these views, and differences of detail do not alter 
the general results.* 
Following this up we get the greatest assistance from 
Asia. The Semang people of the Malay Peninsula 
are a short race, the male being four feet nine inches 
in height, with woolly and tufted hair, thick lips and 
flat nose, and their language is connected with the

group of which the Khasi people is a member.1_ They 
subsist upon the birds and beasts of the forest, and 
roots, eating elephants, rhinoceros, monkeys, and rats. 
They are said to have chiefs among them, but all 
property is common. Their huts or temporary dwell- 
ings, for they have no fixed habitations but rove 
about like the beasts of the forest, consist of two posts 
stuck in the ground with a small cross-piece and a few 
leaves or branches of trees laid over to secure them 
from the weather, and their clothing consists chiefly of 
the inner bark of trees.2 They use stone or slate 
implements. The authority for this information does 
not directly state their social formation, but in a footnote 
he compares them to the Negritos of the Philippine 
Islands, ‘‘ who are divided into very small societies very 
little connected with each other.” This is confirmed 
by Mr. Hugh Clifford, who relates a story told to him 
in the camp of the Semangs, which tells how these 
people were driven to their present resting-place, ‘‘ not 
for love of these poor hunting grounds,” but because 
they were thrust there by the Malays who stole their 
women. One further point is interesting ; they have 
a legend of a people in their old home, composed of 
women only. ‘‘These women know not men, but 
but when the moon is at the full, they dance naked in 
the grassy places near the salt-licks ; the evening wind 
is their only spouse, and through him they conceive

must not in later life injure any tree which belongs to 
the species of his birth-tree, and must not eat of its 
fruit. There is a theory to accompany this practice, 
for birds are believed to be vehicles for the introduction 
of the soul into the newborn child, and all human souls 
grow upon a soul-tree in the other world, whence they 
are fetched by a bird which is killed and eaten by the 
expectant mother ;! but there seems to be no evidence 
of any religious cult or rite, and what there is of myth- 
ology or legend is probably borrowed.? The details in 
this case are of special importance, as they form a com- 
plete set of associated culture elements, and I shall have 
to return to them later on. 
I shall not attempt to exhaust the evidence to be 
derived from the pygmy people. What has been said 
of the examples I have chosen may in all essentials be 
said of the remaining examples. But it is perhaps 
advisable to be assured that the evidence of kinless 
people is not confined to the stunted and dwarfed 
races, for it has been argued that the pygmies are 
nothing but the ne’er-do-wells of the stronger races, 
and may not therefore be taken as true racial types. 
This may be true, but it does not affect my case, 
because I am not depending so much upon the 
physical characteristics of these people as upon their 
culture characteristics. These are definite and conclu- 
sive, and they are repeated among people of higher 
physical type. Thus the Jolas of the Gambia district 
have practically no government and no law; every 
man does as he chooses, and the most successful thief 
is considered the greatest man. There is no recog-

nised punishment for murder or any other crime. In- 
dividual settlement is the only remedy, and the fittest 
survives. There is no formality in regard to marriage, 
or what passes for marriage, amongst them. Natural 
selection is observed on both sides, and the pair, after 
having ascertained a reciprocity of sentiment, at once 
cohabit. They do not intermarry with any other 
race.? 
It is possible to proceed from this to other regions 
of man’s occupation ground. In America, the evidence 
of the modern savage is preceded by most interesting 
facts. If we compare Dr. Brinton’s conclusions as to 
the spread of the American Indians from the north to 
the south, and as to the development of culture in the 
favoured districts being of the same origin as the un- 
developed culture of the less favoured and of abso- 
lutely sterile districts, with Mr. Curtin’s altogether 
independent conclusions as to the growth of the 
American creation myth with its cycle of first people 
peaceful and migratory, and its cycle of second people 
“containing accounts of conflicts which are ever recur- 
rent,” we are conscious that mythic and material 
remains of great movements of people are in ab- 
solute accord,” an accord which leads us to expect 
that the peoples who were pushed ever forward 
into the most desolate and most sterile districts of 
southern America would be the most nearly savage of 
all the American peoples. This is in agreement with

Government Blue Book.

Darwin’s estimate of the Fuegians who wander about 
in groups of kinless society,! and it is in accord with 
other evidence. Thus the Zaparos, belonging to the 
great division of unchristianised Indians of the oriental 
province of Ecuador, have the fame of being most 
expert woodsmen and hunters. To communicate with 
one another in the wood, they generally imitate the 
whistle of the toman or partridge. They believe that 
they partake of the nature of the animals they devour. 
They are very disunited, and wander about in separate 
hordes. The stealing of women is much carried on 
even amongst themselves. A man runs away with 
his neighbour’s wife or one of them, and secretes him- 
self in some out of the way spot until he gathers 
information that she is replaced, when he can again 
make his appearance, finding the whole difficulty 
smoothed over. In their matrimonial relations they 
are very loose—monogamy, polygamy, communism, 
and promiscuity all apparently existing amongst them. 
They allow the women great liberty and frequently 
change their mates or simply discard them when they 
are perhaps taken up by another. They believe in a 
devil or evil spirit which haunts the woods, and call 
him Zamaro.? 
In all these cases, and I do not, of course, exhaust 
the evidence, there is enough to suggest that the social 
forms presented are of the most rudimentary kind. 
Conjecture has not and, I think, cannot get further 
back than such evidence as this. The social grouping 
is supported by outside influences rather than internal

  248 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
organisation; neither blood kinship nor marital kinship 
is recognised ; hostility to all other groups and from 
other groups is the basis of inter-groupal life. To 
these significant characteristics has to be added the 
special birth custom and belief of the Semang pygmies. 
It is clear that the soul-bird belief and the tree-naming 
custom are different phases of one conception of social 
life, a conception definitely excluding recognition of 
blood kinship, and derived from the conscious adop- 
tion of an experience which has not reached the stage 
of blood kinship, but which includes a close associ- 
ation with natural objects. All this makes it advisable 
to take fuller count of pygmy culture than has hitherto 
been given to it. The pygmies have in truth always 
been a problem in man’s history. From the time 
of Homer, Herodotos, and Aristotle, the pygmies 
have had their place among the observable types of 
man, or among the traditions to which observers have 
given credence. In modern times they have been 
accounted for either as peoples degraded from a higher 
level of culture, or as peoples who have never advanced. 
But whether we look upon these people as the last rem- 
nants of the primitive condition of hostility or whether 
they are reversions to that condition by reason of like 
causes, they bring before us what conjectural research 
has prepared us for. The first supposition is neither 
impossible nor incredible. The slow spreading-out in 
hostile regions would allow of the preservation of some 
examples of preference for unrestrained licence at the 
expense of constant hostility, in place of a modified 
peacefulness at the expense of restricted freedom in 
matters so dear to the human animal as sexual choice
-P-A-G-E-301
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 249 
and power. The second supposition contains an element 
of human history which must find a place in anthro- 
pological research. The possible phases of social 
formation are very limited. If any section of mankind 
cannot develop in one direction, they will stagnate at 
the stage they have reached, or they will retrograde to 
one of the stages from which in times past they have 
proceeded. There is no other course, ‘and the very 
limitations of primitive life prevent us from considering 
the possibility of any other course. Either of these 
alternatives allows us to consider the examples of hostile 
inter-grouping as sufficient to supply us with the van- 
tage ground for observation of man in his earliest 
stages of existence. Perhaps each of them may contain 
somewhat of thetruth. But whatever may be considered 
as the true cause of the pygmy level of culture, there 
is an underlying factor which must count most strongly 
in its determination, namely, that these people are the 
people who in the process of migration have been pushed 
out to the last strongholds of man. Whether they could 
not or would not conform to the newer condition of 
stationary or comparatively stationary society is not 
much to the point in presence of the fact that nowhere 
have they conformed to this standard of existence. More- 
over we are entitled to the argument, which has been 
the main point advanced in connection with the anthro- 
pological problems we are discussing, that the most 
primitive type of man must of necessity be sought for, 
and can only be found at the extremes of the migration 
movement wherever that is discernible.? 
The question now becomes, can we by means of 
1 Quatrefages, The Pygmies, 24, 48, 69.
-P-A-G-E-302
  250 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
recognisable links proceed from the rudimentary kin- 
less stage of society to the earliest stage of kinship 
society? This is a most difficult problem, but it must be 
solved. If the rudimentary kinless groups do indeed 
constitute a factor in human evolution, they are a most 
important factor. If they do not constitute such a factor, 
they can only be accidental productions, the sport of ex- 
ceptional circumstances not in the line of evolution, and 
as such they are not of much use inanthropology. It will 
be seen, therefore, that the connection between rudi- 
mentary kinless society and the earliest, or representa- 
tives of the earliest, kinship society, is an essential part 
of an inquiry into origins. 
It may be approached first from the conjectural basis. 
On this basis it may be asserted that the victorious 
male of the primary groups would remain victorious 
only just so long as he could continue to adjust the 
conditions on the primary basis, and preserve his 
females to himself. New conditions would arise when- 
ever the limitation of the food lands produced a degree 
of localisation of the hitherto movable groups. There 
would then have crept into human experience the 
necessity for something of common action among a 
wider range than the simple group. This is a new 
force, and social evolution is henceforth going to 
operate in addition to, perhaps to a limited extent in 
substitution of, the constant movement towards new 
food lands. The single male would no longer be the 
victorious male by himself; and sharing his power 
with other males meant the reduction of his power in 
his own group. Called away for something more than 
the defence of his own primary group of females, he
-P-A-G-E-303
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 251 
would leave the females with the practical governance 
of the primary groups. This tendency would develop. 
Wherever the constant movement outwards became 
stayed by geographical or other influences, the groups 
which experienced the shock of stoppage would undergo 
change. The female in the various primary groups 
would become a static element, and the male alone 
would follow out in the more restricted area the older 
force of movement which he had learned during the 
period of unrestricted scope. He would have to find 
his mates during his roamings, instead of the former 
condition of fighting for them during the group move- 
ments; and his relationship to the primary groups 
would be therefore fundamentally changed. From 
being the central dominant head, he would become 
a constantly shifting unit. The female under these 
conditions would become the centre of the new social 
unit, and the male would become the hunter for food 
and the fighter against enemies. The new social forces 
would thus consist of local units commanded by the 
female, and revolving units composed of the males, 
and there would arise therefrom cleavage between the 
economic conditions of the two sexes. 
That primitive economics bear the impress of sex 
cleavage is borne out by every class of evidence, and 
it is in this circumstance that we first come upon 
societies distinguished by containing two of the most 
important social elements, exogamy and totemism. 
1 There is ample evidence of this characteristic. Thus, of the 
Australians of Port Lincoln district, it is said that ‘‘the habit of con- 
stantly changing their place of rest is so great that they cannot over- 
come it even if staying where all their wants can be abundantly 
supplied.”—Zrans. Roy. Soc., Victoria, v. 178. 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  252 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
Before, however, examining examples of societies con- 
taining the two elements of exogamy and totemism, it will 
be necessary to say something by way of preliminaries 
on these two elements themselves. They have rightly 
been made the subject of important special inquiry by 
anthropological scholars, as being in fact the key to the 
question of social evolution, and we shall clear the 
ground considerably by first of all turning to the prin- 
cipal authorities on the subject, and ascertaining the 
present position of the inquiry. 
I must however note, in the first place, that as I have 
stated the case, exogamy and totemism appear as two 
separate and distinct elements, whereas it is usual to 
consider exogamy as an essential part of totemism. 
I cannot, however, see that this is so. In advanced 
totemism, it is true, they are found as inseparable 
parts of one system, but they may well have started 
separately and coalesced later. In point of fact, all the 
evidence points in this direction, and if we cease to 
consider exogamy as a necessary element of totemism, 
we can advance investigdtion more rapidly and with 
greater accuracy. 
We come very quickly upon what may be termed 
natural exogamy. Male working with male outside the 
groups formed by women and the younger offspring 
would produce a natural exogamy, which would have 
followed upon the exogamy produced by hostile cap- 
ture of women, and two streams of influence would 
thus tell in favour of the evolution of a system of 
formal exogamy, and Dr. Westermarck’s theory of a 
natural avoidance of housemates, with all its wealth 
of evidence, helps us at this point.   
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 253 
The position is not so clear as to totemism. If we 
begin, however, with a clear understanding that it is not 
a part of the machinery of exogamous grouping, but 
an independent growth of its own, we shall have 
gained an important point, for the contrary opinion 
has very often obscured the issue and prevented re- 
search in the right direction. 
It will be advisable to have before us the principal 
theories as to the origin of totemism. There are practi- 
cally three—Mr. Frazer’s, Mr. Lang’s, and Mr. Baldwin 
Spencer’s. Mr. Frazer considers totemism to be ‘‘in 
its essence nothing more or less than an early theory of 
conception, which presented itself to savage man ata 
time when he was still ignorant of the true cause of 
the propagation of the species.” Mr. Frazer explains 
this theory further by saying that ‘‘ naturally enough, 
when she is first aware of the mysterious movement 
within her, the mother fancies that something has that 
very moment passed into her body, and it is equally 
natural that in her attempt to ascertain what the thing 
is, she should fix upon some object that happened to 
be near her, or to engage her attention at the critical 
moment.”? 
Mr. Lang rejects Mr. Frazer’s theory 7 ¢oto, and 
propounds his own as due to the naming of savage 
societies, and to a sort of natural exogamy produced by 
practically the same set of conditions as I have already 
described. Mr. Lang’s totemism began in the primary 
groups, and began with exogamy as a necessary part 
of it. ‘‘Unessential to my system,” says Mr. Lang, 
‘is the question how the groups got animal names, as 
1 Fortnightly Review, Ixxviii. 455.
-P-A-G-E-306
  254 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
long as they got them, and did not remember how they 
got them, and as long as the names according to their 
way of thinking indicated an essential a mystic 
rapport between each group and its name-giving 
animal. No more than these three things—a group 
animal name of unknown origin; belief in a trans- 
cendental connection between all bearers human and 
bestial of the same name; and belief in the blood 
superstitions (the mystically sacred quality of the 
blood as life)—was needed to give rise to all the totemic 
creeds and practices including exogamy,” and further, 
“we guess that for the sake of distinction, groups 
gave each other animal and plant names. These be- 
came stereotyped we conjecture, and their origin was 
forgotten. The belief that there must necessarily be 
some connection between animals and men of the 
same names led to speculation about the nature of the 
connection. The usual reply to the question was that the 
men and animals of the same name were akin by blood. 
The kinship w7th animals being particularly mysterious 
was peculiarly sacred. From these ideas arose tabus, 
and among others that of totemic exogamy.”’! 
Mr. Baldwin Spencer, and with him Dr. Haddon, 
consider totemism to have arisen from economic 
conditions. Primitive human groups, says Dr. Haddon, 
“could never have been large, and the individuals 
comprising each group must have been closely related. 
In favourable areas each group would have a tendency 
to occupy a restricted range, owing to the disagreeable 
results which arose from encroaching on the territory 
over which another group wandered. Thus, it would 
1 Secret of the Totem, 125, 140. 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 255 
inevitably come about that a certain animal or plant, or 
group of animals or plants, would be more abundant in 
the territory of one group than in that of another.”? 
These theories are not necessarily mutually destruc- 
tive, though they seem to me even collectively not to con- 
tain the full case for totemism. Mr. Frazer does not 
account for woman’s isolation at the time of conceptual 
quickening, for the closeness of her observation of local 
phenomena, and for the separateness of her ideas from 
the actual facts of procreation. Mr. Lang overloads his 
case. He is accounting not for the origin of totemism, 
but for the origin of all, or almost all, that totemism 
contains in its most developed forms—‘‘all the totemic 
creeds and practices including exogamy” as he says. 
He postulates a name-giving process by drawing upon 
the conceptions as to names by advanced savage thought, 
and he does not account for the fact that according to his 
theory, animals and plants must not only have been 
named, but named upon some sort of system known to 
a wide area of peoples, before totemistic names for the 
groups could have been given tothem. Mr. Spencer’s 
and Dr. Haddon’s theory is perhaps open to the doubts 
caused by Mr. Lang’s criticism of it that there is only 
one case of a known economic cause for totemism—an 
Australian case where two totem kins are said to have 
been so called ‘‘ from having in former times principally 
subsisted on a small fish and a very small opossum ” ;” 
but on the other hand it does supply a vera causa, the 
actual evidence for which may well have passed away

with the development of totemism, without leaving 
survivals. 
All these theories, however, are the result of con- 
siderable research and experience, and it is more than 
probable that they may each contain fragments of the 
truth which need the touch of combination to show how 
they stand in relation to the problem which they are 
propounded to solve. There are features of totemism 
which are not noticed by any of these distinguished 
authorities. By using the hitherto unnoticed features, 
I think it possible to produce a theory as to the origin 
of totemism, which will contain the essential features of 
those theories now prominently before the world. 
I will set down the order in which the problem can 
be approached from the standpoint already reached, 
and we may afterwards try to ascertain what proof is 
to be derived from totemic societies of the rudest type. 
Now totemism is essentially a system of social group- 
ing, whose chief characteristic is that it is kinless— 
that is to say, the tie of totemism is not the tie of blood 
kinship, but the artificially created association with 
natural objects or animals. It takes no count of father- 
hood, and only reckons with the physical fact of mother- 
hood. It is not the actual fatherhood or the actual 
motherhood which is the fundamental basis of totem- 
ism, but the association with animal, plant, or other 
natural object. This is evidently the fact, whatever 
view is taken of totemism, and that totemism is, in its 
origin and principle, a kinless, not a kinship system, 
is the first fact of importance to bear in mind through- 
out all inquiry. Thus Messrs. Spencer and Gillen say 
“the identity of the human individual is often sunk   
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 257 
in that of the animal or plant from which he is sup- 
posed to have originated.”? 
The next fact of importance is that as it commences at 
birth time, it must be closely associated with the mother 
and her actions as mother. This leads us to the 
observation that it is through the agency of the mother 
that the totem name is conferred upon their children, and 
to the necessary antecedent fact that women must have 
themselves possessed the name they conferred—pos- 
sessed, that is, either the name as a personal attribute 
and valued as such, or else the power of evolving the 
name and the capacity of using it with totemic signifi- 
cance. I conclude from this, therefore, that the search 
for the origin of totemism must be made from the 
women’s side of the social group. Such a search 
would lead straight to the industrialism of early woman, 
from which originated the domestication of animals, 
the cultivation of fruits and cereals, and the appropria- 
tion of such trees and shrubs as were necessary to 
primitive economics.” The close and intimate relation- 
ship with human life which such animals, plants, and 
trees would assume under the social conditions which 
have been postulated as belonging to this earliest stage 
of evolution, and the aid which these friendly and 
always present companions would render at all times 
and under most circumstances, would generate and de- 
velop many of those savage conceptions which have 
become known to research. As human friends they 
would become part of humanity, just as Livingstone

notes of an African people that they did not eat the 
beef which he offered to them because ‘‘they looked 
upon cattle as human and living at home like men,” 
an idea which is also the basis of the custom in India 
not to taste fruit of a newly planted ta tree 
t until it is formally ‘‘married” to some other tree.” 
These are but the fortunate instances where definite 
record in set terms has been made. At the back of 
them lies a whole collection of anthropomorphic con- 
ceptions, indulged in by man at all stages of his career.?

name given to the marriage ceremony performed in honour of a newly 
planted orchard, without which preliminary observance it is not proper 
to partake of its fruit. A man holding the Salagram personates the 
bridegroom, and another holding the sacred Tulsi personates the bride. 
After burning a hom or sacrificial fire, the officiating Brahmin puts the 
usual questions to the couple about to be united, The bride then per- 
ambulates a small spot marked out in the centre of the orchard. Pro- 
ceeding from the south towards the west, she makes the circuit three 
times, followed at a short distance by the bridegroom holding in his hand 
a strip of her chadar of garment. After this, the bridegroom takes 
precedence, making his three circuits, and followed in like manner by 
his bride. The ceremony concludes with the usual offerings” (Elliot, 
Folklore of North-west Provinces of India, i. 234). 
3 Myths explaining the domestication of animals belong to this stage 
of culture. The dog is a sacred animal among the Khasis, with certain 
totemic associations, and there is a very realistic and humanising myth 
relating how the dog came to be regarded as the friend of man (Gurdon, 
The Khasis, 51, 172-3). The Kyeng creation legend includes a good 
example of animal friendship with man (Lewin, Wild bia of South- 
east India, 238-9). The American creation myths afford remarkable testi- 
mony to this view of the case. ‘‘Game and fish of all sorts were under 
direct divine supervision . . . maize or Indian corn is a transformed 
god who gave himself to be eaten to save men from hunger and death” 
(Curtin, Creation Myths of Primitive America, pp. xxvi, xxxviii). The 
Narrinyeri Australians ‘‘do not appear to have any story of the origin 
of the world, but nearly all animals they suppose anciently to have been 
men who performed great prodigies, and at last transformed them- 
selves into different kinds of animals and stones” (Taplin, Zhe Nar- 
rinyert, 59).

As superhuman agencies for pregnancy and birth, they 
would do what the human father in the society we are 
contemplating could not be expected to do, for he 
would be seldom present during the long period of 
pregnancy; he would have shared with other males 
the privileges of sexual intercourse, and he would 
therefore not be so closely in companionship with the 
women of the local groups as the friendly animal, 
plant, or tree who did so much for the mothers. There 
would thus be formed the groundwork for the fashion- 
ing of that most incredible of all beliefs, well founded, 
as Mr. Hartland has proved both from tradition and 
belief,! that the human father was not father, and that 
other agencies were responsible for the birth of 
children. 
Gathering up the several threads of this argument, it 
seems to me that there is within this sphere of primitive 
thought and within these conditions of primitive life, 
ample room for the growth of all the main conceptions 
belonging to totemism ; and it will be seen how neces- 
sary it is to separate totemism at its beginning from 
totemism in its most advanced stages. Totemism has 
not come to man fully equipped in all its parts. It 
is like every other human institution, the result of a 
long process of development, and the various stages of 
development are important parts of the evidence as to 
origins. At the beginning, it was clearly not connected 
with blood kinship and descent; it was as clearly not 
connected with any class system of marriage. But its 
beginnings would allow of these later growths, would 
perhaps almost engender these later growths.

Thus, the primary notion of the totem birth of 
children would, when blood kinship and descent be- 
came a consciously accepted element in social develop- 
ment, easily slide into the belief of a totemic ancestor 
and kinship with the totem ; the protection and assist- 
ance afforded by the totem to the women of the primary 
groups who became the mothers of new generations, 
would easily grow into a sort of worship of the totem ; 
the adoption of the totem name from the circumstances 
of birth implying the origin of the name from within 
the group and not from without would, as aggregation 
took the place of segregation, give way before the 
association of groups of persons with common interests ; 
the aggregate totem name would come to the separate 
local totems as soon as, but not before, aggregation had 
taken the place of segregation in the formation of the 
social system, and this was not at the earliest stage; the 
close association of the totems with groups of mothers 
who always took the fathers of their children from 
without the mother group, would readily develop into 
differentiating the mother totems within the group 
from the totems of the fathers without the group, 
and this differentiation would produce a special relation- 
ship between the sexes based upon the difference of 
totems instead of upon the sameness of them; and 
finally there would be produced first a two-class division 
founded on sex—all the mothers and all the fathers— 
and, only in a developed form, a two-class division 
founded on the accepted totem name. | 
If this is a probable view of the course of totemic 
evolution, we may more confidently refer to its final 
stages for further evidence. Advanced totemic society
-P-A-G-E-313
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 261 
shows a constant tendency to substitute blood kinship 
for the association with natural objects: first, blood 
kinship with the mother, then with the mother and the 
father, finally recognised through the father only. At 
this last stage, blood kinship has practically succeeded 
in expelling totemic association altogether in favour of 
tribal kinship by blood descent, for totemism with male 
descent as the basis of the social group is totemism in 
name only ; the names of totemism remain but they are 
applied to kinship tribes or sections of tribes, and they 
do duty therefore as a convenient name-system without 
reference to their origin in definite association with the 
naming animal or plant; and it is already in position 
to surrender also the names and outward signs. Blood 
kinship is therefore the destroyer, not the generator, of 
totemism, and we are therefore compelled to get at 
the back of blood kinship if we want to find totem 
beginnings. 
This is an important aspect of the case, and it is one 
which, I think, cannot be ignored. We have found 
that rudimentary totemism was the basis of a social 
system founded on artificial associations with animal or 
plant, was therefore kinless in character; and we have 
found that when totemism has been carried on into 
a society developed upon the recognition of blood kin- 
ship, blood kinship became antagonistic to totemism, 
and ultimately displaced it. These two facts point to 
the rudimentary kinless system as the true origin of 
totemism.

ill 
Now we may test these conclusions by applying the 
theory they contain to an actual case of totemic society. 
It would be well to choose for this purpose a people 
who had specialised their totemic organisation, and 
there are only two supreme instances of this mong the 
races of the world—the North American Indians and 
the Australians. Everywhere else, where totemism 
exists, it is not the dominant feature of the social 
organisation. In Asia and in Africa totemism is sub- 
ordinate to, or at all events in close or equal associa- 
tion with, other elements, and we cannot be quite sure 
that we have in these cases pure totemism. North 
American totemism is in the most advanced stage. 
Australian totemism is to a very considerable degree 
less advanced, and it is therefore to Australian totemism 
I shall turn for evidence. 
But even here it is necessary to bear in mind that 
primitive as the Australians are, they are not so primi- 
tive as to be in the primary stages of totemic society. 
They have developed, and developed strongly along 
totemic lines, and we know that such development 
once started has the capacity to proceed far. _ What we 
have to do, therefore, is to attempt to penetrate beneath 
the range of development, to search for the social 
group at the farthest from the centre point from which 
migration started, to discover, if we can, relics of group 
hostility, hostile capture of women and of kinless 
society, all of which belong to the primary stage from 
which totemic development has taken place. If we 
can do this, we may hope to arrive at the origin of 
|

-P-A-G-E-315
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 263 
totemism, and we are more likely to accomplish it in 
the case of the Australians than with any other people. 
If we cannot, as Mr. Lang alleges, anywhere see 
‘‘absolutely primitive man and a totemic system in the 
making,”! we may go back along the lines from which 
totemism has developed in Australian society and see 
somewhat of the process of the making. 
We may commence with evidence of the survival of 
the most primitive human trait, the condition of hos- 
tility among the local groups produced by the struggle 
for women. ‘‘The possession of a girl appears to 
be connected with all their ideas of fighting . 
after a battle the girls do not always follow their 
fugitive husbands from the field, but frequently go 
over as a matter of course to the victors, even with 
young children on their backs.”? Mr. Curr puts the 
evidence even more definitely in a primitive setting 
when he informs us of ‘‘the young bachelors of the 
tribe carrying off some of the girl wives of the grey- 
beards,” leaving the old territory and settling at the 
first convenient place within thirty or forty miles of the 
old territory. I call this state of things ‘‘survival,”? 
because it is the existence in totemic society of the 
fundamental basis of pre-totemic society. It is checked 
in Australian totemic society by rules which show a 
strong development from the primitive. Thus the 
successful warrior may not take any of his captives 
to himself; ‘‘if a warrior took to himself a captive who

belonged to a forbidden class, he would be hunted 
down like a wild beast,” is the evidence of Mr. Fison, 
who allows it to be ‘‘a strong statement, but it rests 
upon strong evidence.”! This is the exogamous class 
system operating even in the case of conflict, when 
men have resorted to their primitive instincts and their 
primitive methods. | 
This discovery of primitive hostility accompanying the 
obtaining of wives leads us to look for other survivals 
of the earliest conditions, and we come upon mother- 
right groups in which the females in each local group 
are the sexual companions of males from outside their 
own social group. This is shown by the Kamilaroi 
organisation, where ‘‘a woman is married to a thousand 
miles of husbands.”? This phrase may be textually an 
exaggeration of actual fact, but it undoubtedly expresses 
a condition of things which actually existed. Women 
in Australian society must look outside their class, and 
in general outside their totem, for their sexual mates, and 
they must expect to be claimed as rightful sexual mates 
by men whom they have never seen and who live at great 
distances. Carry this state of things but a few steps 
back, and we must come to a condition of localised 
female groups with males moving from group to group. 
Surely there is something more here than savage 
organisation. The something more is the development 
into a system of one of the results of the enforced 
migratory conditions of early man, namely, the mi- 
gratory instincts of the males moving outside the 
female local groups and thus producing natural ex-

ogamy. This is what appears to me to be clearly a 
distinct element in the Australian system. But there 
is a new element in juxtaposition with it. The new 
element is the organisation into marriage classes—not 
every man from without, but only special men from 
without, are allowed the sexual companionship. 
Now in both these cases, where we have apparently 
penetrated to the most primitive conditions, we are also 
brought up abruptly against conditions which are not 
primitive, namely, the exogamous class system, and 
we are bound to conclude that this class system thus 
shows itself to be an intruding force which has not, 
however, been strong enough to quite obliterate the 
older forces of hostile marriage-capture and mother- 
right society. 
Our next quest is therefore to find out, if we can, an 
explanation of these two contrasted elements in Austra- 
lian totemic society, and for this purpose it is advisable 
to still further narrow down the range of inquiry to one 
special section of the Australian peoples. For this 
purpose I shall take the Arunta. There has been much 
controversy about this people. Mr. Lang argues that 
the presence of exogamous classes and male descent 
shows the Arunta to be more advanced than other 
Australian peoples ;1 Messrs. Spencer and Gillen that 
the survival of totem beliefs, which are local and un- 
connected with the class system, proves them to be 
the least advanced. In this country Mr. Hartland and 
Mr. Thomas side with Mr. Lang; Mr. Frazer with 
Messrs. Spencer and Gillen. 
The first point of importance to note about the 
1 Lang, Secret of the Totem, 64. 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
   
266 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
Arunta people is that they occupy the ve favourable 
districts for food supply.!| This means that they have 
been pushed there. They did not choose such a loca- 
tion—in other words, they are among the last units of 
the migration movements which peopled Australia; they 
are among the last people to have become stationary as 
a group, and to have been compelled to resort to the 
development of social organisation in lieu of constantly 
swarming off from the centre or from the last stopping 
place totheends. This tells for primitive, not advanced, 
conditions. 
The next point is the totem system. Messrs. Spencer 
and Gillen, describing one special case as an example 
of the rest, give us the following particulars. The 
Arunta believe that the most marked features of the 
district they inhabit, the gaps and the gorges, were 
formed by their Alcheringa ancestors. These Alcher- 
inga are represented as collected together in companies, 
each of which consisted of a certain number of indi- 
viduals belonging to one particular totem. Each of 
these Alcheringa ancestors carried about with him or 
her one or more of the sacred stones called churinga. 
These are the general traditions related by the Arunta 
of to-day to explain their own customs, and let it be 
noted that the explanation does not necessarily lead us 
to the primitive conceptions of the Arunta people, but 
to their present conceptions as to unknown facts. The 
local example is found close to Alice Springs, where 
there are deposited a large number of churinga carried 
by the witchetty grub men and women. A large 
number of prominent rocks and boulders, and certain

-P-A-G-E-319
     , ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 267 
ancient gum trees, are the nanja trees and rocks of 
these spirits. If a woman conceives a child after having 
been near to this gap, it is one of these spirit individuals 
which has entered her body, and when born must of 
necessity be of the witchetty grub totem; ‘‘it is, in 
fact, nothing else but the reincarnation of one of the 
witchetty grub people of the Alcheringa”’; the nanja 
tree, or stone, ever afterwards is the nanja of the child, 
and there is special connection between it and the child, 
injury to the nanja object meaning injury to the nanja 
man.! There is evidence that the reincarnation theory 
is not admissible,? and, indeed, it does not seem 
warranted on the facts presented by the authors. With 
this unnecessary element out of the way, then, there is 
left a system of local totemism, arising at birth and 
depending upon the mother, without reference in any 
way to the father, associated with natural features, rocks 
and trees, and showing in a special way a curious 
system of sex cleavage by the men of the group being 
the exclusive guardians of the sacred churinga, and the 
women the active power by which the churinga becomes 
connected with the newly-born member of the totem 
group.® 
Now at this point we may surely refer back to the 
custom and belief of the Semang people of the Malay 
Peninsula, and I suggest that we have the closest 
parallel between Semang belief and custom and Arunta 
totemism, not quite the same formula perhaps, but 
1 Spencer and Gillen, Central Tribes, 120, 124, 133.

-P-A-G-E-320
  268 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
assuredly the same fundamental conception of every 
child at birth being in intimate association with objects 
of nature, and this association being the determining 
force of the newly-born man’s social status and class, 
lasting all through life. In each case the kinless 
basis of totemism is thus fully shown. The totem 
names given by women, or assumed on account of the 
conditions attachable to women as mothers, did not 
extend to the human fathers. The fathers may be 
known or unknown to the mothers, but they did not 
become associated with the totems which the mothers 
associated with their children. To the extent of father- 
hood, therefore, totemism of this type was clearly not 
based upon the natural fact of blood kinship, but upon 
the conscious adoption of a non-kinship form of society. 
To the extent of motherhood also it was not based upon 
blood kinship, for it was the local totem, not the 
mother’s totem, which became the totem of the newly- 
born member of the group. We thus have an entirely 
non-kinship form of society to deal with, a kinless 
society, ‘‘where there is no necessary relationship 
of any kind between that of children and parents.’ 
Primitive man consciously adapted certain of his ob- 
servations of nature to his social needs, and among 
these observations the fact of actual blood kinship 
with father and mother played no part. It would ap- 
pear therefore that totemism at its foundation was 
based upon a theoretical conception of relationship 
between man and animal or plant. Place of birth, 
association with natural objects, not motherhood and 
not fatherhood, are the determining factors. 
1 Spencer and Gillen, Northern Tribes, 144.
-P-A-G-E-321
  
ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 269 
We may proceed to inquire as to the social form 
which has become evolved from this kinless system. 
In the case of the Semangs we have the kinless 
totemic belief and custom existing within a kinless 
society. In the case of the Arunta we have the kin- 
less totemism existing in a society based on a kinless 
organisation still, but containing also full recognition 
of motherhood,! and perhaps recognition of physical 
fatherhood.” There is, therefore, an important distinc- 
tion in the social position of the two parallel systems. 
Among the Semang people, their totemic belief and 
custom do not carry with them a superstructure of 
society. They form the substantive cult of the 
scattered social groups, which are kinless groups de- 
pendent upon ties local in character and derived from 
the conscious use of the facts of nature surrounding 
them. Among the Arunta people, on the contrary, the 
totem belief and custom are contained within a social 
system of extraordinary dimensions and proportions. 
Of course, the obvious questions to raise are—have the 
Semang people lost a once existing social system con- 
nected with their totemic cult? Have the Arunta 
people had imposed upon them a social system which 
has not destroyed their primitive totemic cult? 
To answer these questions I can only deal with 
the Semang evidence as it appears in researches of 
great authority and weight, and there is undoubtedly 
in all the evidence produced by Messrs. Skeat and 
1 Globus, xci, gives important evidence of traces of female descent 
among the Arunta, 
2 There is conflict of testimony on this point. Spencer and Gillen 
deny that the Arunta recognise the fact of paternity in any way (see 
Northern Tribes, pp. xiii, 145, 330), and yet talk of the ‘‘actual father” 
in ceremonial functions (p. 361). 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
  270 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
Blagden, and the authorities they use, nothing what- 
ever to suggest that Semang totemism once possessed 
above it an elaborate social organisation of the usual 
totemic type. There is indeed, the myth which points 
to a two-class exogamous division for marital purposes,! 
but there is more than myth for the unrestricted 
intercourse of the sexes both before and after marital 
rights.2. In every other direction we get simple 
groups fashioned on no larger basis than nomadic 
roaming and journeying to fresh food grounds. On 
the other hand, there is much to suggest that the 
Arunta have a dual system of organisation; one, in 
which the primitive types are still surviving, the 
second, a more advanced type which covers but does 
not crush out the first. If this is so, it is clear that 
the parallel between Semang and Arunta totemism is 
considerably closer than at first appears. 
It will be necessary, therefore, to deal with the two 
principal signs of alleged Arunta progress, male 
descent and the exogamous classes. I see no evidence 
whatever of male descent; male ascendancy, a very 
different thing, appears, but there cannot strictly be 
male descent where fatherhood is unrecognised. And 
here I would interpose the remark that the use of the 
term descent, male descent and female descent, in 
these studies is far too indiscriminate.* Descent means 
succession by blood kinship by acknowledged sons or 
daughters, and this is exactly what does not always

   ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 275 
occur. Sonship and daughtership in our sense of the 
term are not always known to savagery. They were 
not known to the Arunta males, for fatherhood was 
not recognised by them and motherhood was not de- 
finitely used in the social sense. All that the Arunta 
can be said to have developed is a mother-right society 
with male ascendancy in the group.' Group sons 
succeeded to group fathers, but individual descent 
from father to son there is not. 
There remain the exogamous classes. In the first 
place, it is necessary to get rid of a difficulty raised by 
Mr. Lang. ‘‘In no tribe with female descent can a 
district have its local totem as among the Arunta. . . . 
This can only occur under male reckoning of descent.”? 
But surely so acute an observer as Mr. Lang would 
see that with female descent right through, as it exists 
among the Khasia and Kocch people of Assam, local 
totem centres are just as possible as with male descent. 
Mr. Lang is conscious of some discrepancy here, for 
a little later on he repeats the statement that local totem 
centres ‘‘can only occur and exist under male reckon- 
ing of descent,” but adds the significant qualification 
‘‘in cases where the husbands do not go to the wives 
region of abode.”* This is the whole point. Where 
husbands do go to the wives’ region of abode, as they 
ido among the Khasis and the Kocch, female descent 
1 In this they are exactly paralleled by the Khasi people of Assam, 
mong whom we find a limited sort of male chiefship by succession 
hrough females, and an absolute succession to property by females by 
uccession through females (Gurdon, Zhe Khasis, 68, 88). Descent 
rom the female is absolute in both cases, and all we get is male 
scendancy, 
2 Secret of the Totem, 73. 8 Op. cit., 79. 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
  272 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
would allow of the formation of local totem centres. 
This is not far from the position of the Arunta. They 
are mother-right societies. The mother secures the 
totem name. The father, de facto, is not father ac- 
cording to the ideas of the Arunta people, is at best 
only one of a group of possible fathers according to 
the practices of the Arunta people. Therefore, the 
local totem centre is formed out of a system which may 
be called a mother-right system for the purpose of 
scientific description, but which is not even a mother- 
right system to the natives, because motherhood is not 
the foundation of the local group. 
Secondly, we have the important fact, which Mr. 
Lang has duly noted, though he does not apparently 
see its significance in the argument as to origins, that 
the class system ‘‘arose in a given centre and was 
propagated by emigrants and was borrowed by distant 
tribes.”+ Messrs. Spencer and Gillen distinctly affirm 
that the ‘‘division into eight has been adopted (or 
rather the names for the four new divisions have been) 
in recent times by the Arunta tribe from the Llpirra 
tribe which adjoins the former on the north, and the 
use of them is at the present time spreading south- 
wards.”? This view is supported by the widespread 
organisation of eagle-hawk and crow, and by the 
general homogeneity of Australian social forms. It is 
clear, therefore, that room is made for the external 
organisation of the class system and the consequent

production of the dual characteristics of the Arunta— 
the joint product of the fossilisation of mother-right 
society at the end of the migration movement, and the 
superimposing upon this fossilisation, with its tendency 
towards the class system, of the fully organised class 
system. The two systems are not now fully welded in 
the Arunta group. Whatever view is taken of these, 
whether they be considered advanced or primal, the 
undoubted dualism has to be accounted for, and the 
best way of accounting for this dualism is, I submit, 
that of differential evolution. Further study of Messrs. 
Spencer and Gillen’s work, together with the criticisms 
of various scholars, Mr. Lang, Mr. Hartland, Mr. 
Frazer, Mr. Thomas, and others, convinces me that 
the extreme artificiality of the class system is due 
partly to a want of understanding of the entire facts, 
and partly to the ad hoc adoption by the natives them- 
selves of new plans to meet difficulties which must 
arise out of a too close adhesion to their rules. Mr. 
Lang has allowed me to see a manuscript note of his, 
in which he points out that the inevitable result of 
the one totem to the one totem rule of marital relation- 
ship,—that is, totem A always intermarrying with 
totem B, males and females from both totems, and 
with no others,—is the consanguineous relationship of 
all the members of the two totems. The rule for non- 
consanguineous marriage has therefore broken down, 
and when it breaks down the Australian introduces a 
new rule which satisfies immediate necessities. When 
this in turn breaks down a further new rule is made, 
and this is the way I think the differing rules resulted. 
They represent, therefore, not varying degrees of cul- 
T 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  274 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
ture progress, but only varying degrees of artificial 
social changes, and they spring from the oldest condi- 
tions of all where there is no class system at all.! Arunta 
society is not a ‘‘sport” under this view, but a product 
—a product to be accounted for and explained by 
anthropological rules, derived not only from Australian 
society but from the general facts of human society 
which have remained for observation by the science of 
to-day. The parallel between Semang and Arunta, 
therefore, helps us in two ways. It enables us to go back 
to Semang totemism as an example of primitive kinless 
society, and forward to Arunta totemism as an example of 
early development therefrom. We have, in point of fact, 
discovered the datum line of totemism. Upon this 
may be constructed the various examples according to 
their degrees of development, and we may thus see in 
detail the commencing elements of totemism as well 
as the means by which we may proceed from the com- 
mencing elements to the more advanced elements, and 
finally to the last stages of totemic society where 
blood kinship is fully recognised and used, where, in 
fact, totemic tribes as distinct from totemic peoples 
take their place in the world’s history. 
IV 
I do not propose in this chapter to proceed further 
with this inquiry. It will not advance my object, nor 
is it absolutely necessary. Totemism in the full has 
been described adequately by Mr. Frazer in his valu- 
able abstract of the evidence supplied from all parts of 
1 Spencer and Gillen, Zribes of Central Australia, 96, 99, 106.
-P-A-G-E-327
ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 275 
the world, and there is not much in dispute among the 
authorities when once the stage of origin is passed. 
There is danger, however, at the other extreme, 
namely, the attempt to discover totemism in impossible 
places in civilisation. Mr. Morgan has shown us totemic 
society in its highest form of development, untouched 
by other influences of sufficient consequence to divert 
its natural evolution. This, I think, is the merit of 
Mr. Morgan’s great work, and not his attempt, his 
futile attempt as I think, to apply the principles of 
totemic society to the elucidation of societies that have 
long passed the stage of totemism. In particular, the 
great European civilisations are not totemic, nor are 
they to be seen passing from totemism. It is true that 
Mr. Lang, Mr. Grant Allen, and others have attempted 
to trace in certain features of Greek ritual and belief, 
and in certain tribal formations discoverable in Anglo- 
Saxon Britain, the relics of a living totemism in the 
civilised races of Europe;! but I do not believe 
either of these scholars would have endorsed his 
early conclusions in later studies. Mr. Grant Allen 
did not, so far as I know, repeat this theory after 
its first publication, and Mr. Lang has given many 
signs of being willing to withdraw it. The fact is, 
there is no necessity to think of Greek or English 
totem society because in Greece and England there 
are traces of totem beliefs. We may disengage them 
from their national position and put them back to the 
position they occupied before the coming of Greek or 
Englishman into the countries they have made their own.

  276 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
In that position there may well have been totemic 
peoples in Britain of the type we have been considering 
from Australia. I have already indicated that totemic 
survivals in folklore have been the subject of a special 
study of my own which still in the main stands good, 
and for which I have collected very many additional 
illustrations and proofs. I discovered that folklore 
contained some remarkably perfect examples of totemic 
belief and custom, and also a considerable array of 
scattered belief and custom connected with animals 
and plants which, unclassified, seemed to lead to no 
definite stage of culture history, yet when classified, 
undoubtedly led to totemism. The result was somewhat 
remarkable. At many points there are direct parallels 
to savage totemism, and the whole associated group of 
customs received adequate explanation only on the 
theory that it represented the detritus of a once exist- 
ing totemic system of belief. 
The present study enables me to take the parallel to 
primitive totemism much closer. One of the perfect 
examples was of a local character. This was found in 
Ossory. Giraldus Cambrensis tells an extraordinary 
legend to the following effect: ‘‘ A priest benighted in 
a wood on the borders of Meath was confronted by a 
wolf, who after some preliminary explanations gave 
this account of himself: There are two of us, a man 
and a woman, natives of Ossory, who through the 
curse of one Natalis, saint and abbot, are compelled 
every seven years to put off the human form and 
depart from the dwellings of men. Quitting entirely 
the human form, we assume that of wolves. At the 
end of the seven years, if they chance to survive, two

others being substituted in their places, they return to 
their country and their former shape.”! Here is a 
saintly legend introduced to explain the current tradi- 
tion of the men of Ossory, that they periodically 
turned into wolves. Fynes Moryson, in 1603, ridiculed 
the beliefs of ‘‘some Irish who will be believed as men 
of credit,” that men in Ossory were ‘‘ yearly turned 
into wolves.”? But an ancient Irish MS. puts the 
matter much more clearly in the statement that the 
‘‘descendants of the wolf are in Ossory,”* while the 
evidence of Spenser and Camden explains the popular 
beliefs upon even more exact lines. Spenser says 
“that some of the Irish doe use to make the wolf 
their gossip ” ;* and Camden adds that they term them 
“Chari Christi, praying for them and wishing them 
well, and having contracted this intimacy, professed to 
have no fear from their four-footed allies.” Fynes 
Moryson expressly mentions the popular dislike to 
killing wolves, and they were not extirpated until the 
eighteenth century.© Aubrey adds that ‘‘in Ireland 
they value the fang-tooth of an wolfe, which they set in 
silver and gold as we doe ye Coralls”;® and Camden 
notes the similar use of a bit of wolf’s skin.’ 
In the local superstitions of Ossory, therefore, we 
have several of the cardinal features of savage totem- 
ism, the descent from the totem-animal, the ascription

to the totem of a sacred character, the belief in its pro- 
tection, and a taboo against killing it. I will venture 
to suggest, however, that to these important features 
there is to be added a parallel in survival to the Semang 
and Arunta features where the local circumstances of 
birth are the determining forces which supply the 
totem name, for the relationship of ‘‘ gossip,” ‘‘ god- 
sib,” is clearly of the same character as that of the 
soul-tree of the Semang and the alcheringa of the 
Australian.1_ The condition of survival has altered the 
detail of the parallel, but the parallel is on the same 
plane. 
The wolf as gossip to the men of Ossory leads us on 
to inquire whether any other animal had such close 
connections with human beings. In Erris, a part of 
Connaught, ‘‘the people consider that foxes perfectly 
understand human language, that they can be propiti- 
ated by kindness, and even moved by flattery. They 
not only make mittens for Reynard’s feet to keep him 
warm in winter, and deposit these articles carefully 
near their holes, but they make them sponsors for 
their children, supposing that under the close and long- 
established relationship of Gossipred they will be 
induced to befriend them.”* Thus it appears that the 
selfsame conception which the men of Ossory had in 
the thirteenth century for the wolf, the men of Erris 
1 The significance of the word ‘‘ gossip” is worth noting. Halliwell 
says it “signified a ve/ation or sponsor in baptism, all of whom were to 
each other and to the parents God-sibs, that is, sz, or related by means 
of religion.” This meaning does not seem to have died out in the 
days of Spenser, and his use of the word to describe the relationship of 
the men of Ossory to wolves is very significant. For the history of this 
important word see Hearn’s Aryan Household, 290.

had for the fox in the nineteenth century. No ex- 
planation from the dry details of the natural history 
of these animals is sufficient to account for this curious 
parallel, and we must turn to ancient beliefs for the 
explanation. 
The general attitude of the men of Erris towards the 
fox is confirmed as an attribute of totemism when we 
comé to examine a special local form of it. This we 
can do by turning to Galway. The Claddagh fisher- 
men in Galway would not go out to fish if they 
saw a fox: their rivals of a neighbouring village, not 
believing in the fox, do all they can to introduce a fox 
into the Claddagh village.1_ These people are peculiar 
in many respects, and are distinctively clannish. They 
retain their old clan-dress—blue cloaks and red petti- 
coats—which distinguishes them from the rest of the 
county of Galway, and it may be conjectured that the 
present-day custom of naming from the names of fish 
—thus, Jack the hake, Bill the cod, Joe the eel, Pat the 
trout, Mat the turbot, etc.2—may be a remnant of the 
mental attitude of the folk towards that belief in kin- 
ship between men and animals which is at the basis 
of totemism. But, returning to the fox, we have in 
the belief that meeting this animal would prevent them 
from going out to fish, a parallel to the prohibition 
against looking at the totem which is to be found 
among savage people, and we have in the neighbours’ 
disbelief in the fox and a corresponding belief in the

280 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
hare,! that local distribution of different totems which 
is also found in savagery. But all these particulars 
about the relationship of the fox to the Claddagh 
fishermen receive unexpected light when we inquire 
into the biography of their local saint, named Mac- 
Dara. This saint is the patron saint of the fisher- 
men who, when passing MacDara’s island, always dip 
their sails thrice to avoid being shipwrecked. But 
then, in the folk-belief, we have this remarkable fact, 
that MacDara’s real name was Sinach, a fox®—an 
instance, it would seem, of a totem cult being trans- 
ferred toa Christian saint. Thus, then, in the super- 
stitions of these Claddagh fisherfolk we can trace the 
elements of totemism, the root of which is contained, 
first, in the nominal worship of a Christian saint, and 
second, in the actual worship of an animal, the fox. 
These examples of local totemism may be followed by 
a remarkable example of tribal or kinship totemism. 
It was noted by Mr. G. H. Kinahan in his researches 
for Irish folklore, and is mentioned quite incidentally 
among other items, the collector himself not fully 
perceiving the importance of his ‘‘find.” This really 
enhances the value of the evidence, because it destroys 
any possibility of an objection to its validity—a really 
important matter, considering the remarkable character 
of this survival of totem-stocks in Western Europe. 
The exact words of Mr. Kinahan are as follows :— 
“‘In very ancient times some of the clan Coneely, 
one of the early septs of the county, were changed by

‘art magick’ into seals; since then no Coneely can 
kill a seal without afterwards having bad luck. Seals 
are called Coneelys, and on this account many of 
the name changed it to Connolly.”! The same local 
tradition is mentioned by Hardiman in one of his 
notes to O’Flaherty’s Description of West or H-iar 
Connaught,? but the note is equally significant of 
genuineness from the fact that the tradition is styled 
1 Folklore Journal, ii. 259; Folklore Record, iv. 104. Miss Ffennell kindly 
informed me at the meeting of the Folklore Society where I read a paper 
on the subject, that she had frequently heard the islanders of Achill, off the 
coast of Ireland, state their belief that they were descended from seals. 
2 Published by the Jrish Archeological Society, p. 27; there is a Seal 
Island off the coast of Donegal (Joyce, Zrish Place-Names, ii. 282) ; and 
some Shetland legends of the seal will be found in Soc. Antig. Scot., 
i. 86-89, Seals are eaten for food in the island of Harris (see Martin, 
Western Islands, 36), and one called the Virgin Mary’s Seal is offered 
to the minister (Reeves, Adamnan Vita. Columb., 78, note g). The 
attitude of the Irish to seals is shown by the two following notes :— 
‘At Erris, in Ireland, seals are considered to be human beings under 
enchantment, and they consider it unlucky to have anything to do with 
seals, and to have one live near their dwelling is considered as productive 
of evil to life and property. A story current, in 1841, describes how a 
young fisherman came in a fog upon an island whereon lived these 
enchanted men in their human form, but when they quitted it they 
turned to seals again” (Otway, Sketches of Erris, 398, 403). Off Down- 
patrick Head they used to take seals, but have given up the practice, 
because once two young fellows had urged their curraghs into a cave where 
the seals were known to breed, and they were killing them right and 
left when, in the farthest end of the cave and sitting up on its bent tail 
in a corner, there sat an old seal. One of the boys was just making 
ready to strike him, when the seal cried out, ‘‘Och, boys! och, ma 
bouchals, spare your old grandfather, Darby O’Dowd.” He then pro- 
ceeded to tell the boys his story. ‘It’s thrue I was dead and dacently 
buried, but here I am for my sins turned into a sale as other sinners are 
and will be, and if you put an end to me and skin me maybe it’s 
worser I'll be, and go into a shark or a porpoise. Lave your ould fore- 
father where he is, to live out his time as a sale. Maybe for your own 
sakes you will ever hereafter leave off following and parsecuting and 
murthering sales who may be nearer to yourselves nor you think.” The 
story is universally believed, and on the strength of it the people have 
given up seal hunting (Otway, Sketches of Erris, 230).
-P-A-G-E-334
  282 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
‘a ridiculous story.” It strengthens Mr. Kinahan’s 
note in the following passage: ‘‘In some places the 
story has its believers, who would no more kill a seal, 
or eat ofa slaughtered one, than they would of a human 
Coneely.” 
The clan Coneely is mentioned both by Mr. Kinahan 
and by Mr. Hardiman as one of the oldest Irish septs ; 
and that it is widely spread, and not congregated into 
one locality, is to be inferred from the description of 
the tradition as prevalent in Connaught, especially 
from Mr. Hardiman’s words, describing that ‘‘in some 
places” the story has its believers now; and hence 
we may conclude that wherever the clan Coneely are 
situated there would exist this totem belief. 
The full significance of these facts may best be tested 
by reference to the conditions laid down by Dr. 
Robertson Smith for the discovery of the survivals 
of totemism among the Semitic races. These conditions 
are as follows :— 
“(1) The existence of stocks named after plants and 
animals ’—such stocks, it is necessary to add, being scat- 
tered through many local tribes ; (2) the prevalence of the 
conception that the members of the stock are of the blood 
of the eponym animal, or are sprung from a plant of the 
species chosen as totem; (3) the ascription to the totem of 
a sacred character which may result in its being regarded 
as the god of the stock, but at any rate makes it be regarded 
with veneration, so that, for example, a totem animal is not 
used as ordinary food. If we can find all these things 
together in the same tribe, the proof of totemism is com- 
plete ; but even when this cannot be done, the proof may be 
morally complete if all the three marks of totemism are 
found well developed within the same race. In many cases,
-P-A-G-E-335
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 283 
however, we can hardly expect to find all the marks of 
totemism in its primitive form ; the totem, for example, may 
have become first an animal god, and then an anthropo- 
morphic god, with animal attributes or associations merely.”? 
Now in the Irish case all three of these conditions 
are found together in the same tribe, the clan Coneely, 
and it is impossible to overlook the importance of such 
a discovery. It proves from survivals in folklore that 
totemistic people once lived in ancient Ireland, just as 
the corresponding evidence proved that the ancient 
Semitic stock possessed the totemic organisation. 
We have now examined the most archaic forms of 
the survival of totemism in Britain. If we pass on 
to inquire whether we can detect the more scattered 
and decayed remnants of totem beliefs and customs, 
we turn to Mr. Frazer as our guide. From Mr. 
Frazer’s review of the beliefs and customs incidental 
to the totemistic organisation of savage people, it is 
possible to extract a formula for ascertaining the classi- 
fication of savage beliefs and practices incidental to 
totemism. This formula appears to me to properly fall 
into the following groups :— 
(a) Descent from the totem. 
(4) Restrictions against injuring the totem. 
(c) Restrictions against using the totem for food. 
(d@) The petting and preservation of totems. 
(e) The mourning for and burying of totems. 
(f) Penalties for non-respect of totem. 
(g) Assistance by the totem to his kin. 
(A) Assumption of totem marks.

Archeological Review, “‘ Are there totem clans in the Old Testament?”

-P-A-G-E-336
  284 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
(2) Assumption of totem dress. 
(7) Assumption of totem names. 
My suggestion is that if a reasonable proportion of 
the superstitions and customs attaching to animals and 
plants, preserved to us as folklore, can be classified 
under these heads this is exactly what might be expected 
if the origin of such superstitions and customs is to be 
sought for in a primitive system of totemism which 
prevailed amongst the people once occupying these 
islands. The clan Coneely and the Ossory wolves are 
proofs that such a system existed, and if such perfect 
survivals have been able to descend to modern times, 
in spite of the influences of civilisation, there is no 
prima facie reason why the beliefs and customs inci- 
dental to such a system should not have survived, even 
though they are no longer to be identified with special 
clans. When once a primitive belief or custom becomes 
separated from its original surroundings, it would be 
liable to change. Thus, when the wolf totem of Ossory 
passes into a local cultus, we meet with the belief that 
human beings may be transformed into animal forms, 
as the derivative from the totem belief in descent from 
the wolf. Fortunately, the process by which this 
change took place is discernible in the Ossory ex- 
ample; but it will not be so in other examples, and 
we may therefore assume that the Ossory example 
represents the transitional form and apply it as a key 
to the origin of similar beliefs elsewhere. 
Again, if we endeavour to discover how the asso- 
ciated totem-beliefs of the clan Coneely would appear 
in folklore supposing they had been scattered by the 
influences of civilisation, we can see that at the various 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 285 
places where members of the clan had resided for some 
time there would be preserved fragments of the once 
perfect totem-belief. Thus, one place would retain tra- 
ditions about a fabulous animal who could change into 
human form; another place would preserve beliefs about 
its being unlucky to kill a seal (or some other animal 
specially connected with the locality); another place 
would preserve a superstitious regard for the seal (or 
some other local animal) as an augury; and thus the 
process of transference of beliefs into folklore, from 
one form into other related forms, from one particular 
object connected with the clan to several objects con- 
nected with the localities, would go on from time to 
time, until the difficulty of tracing the original of the 
scattered beliefs and customs would be well-nigh in- 
surmountable without some key. But having once 
proved the existence of such examples as the clan 
Coneely and the Ossory wolves, this difficulty, though 
still great, is very much lessened. Our method would 
be as follows. We first of all postulate that totem 
peoples did actually exist in ancient Britain, or whence 
such extraordinary survivals? We next examine and 
classify the beliefs and customs which are incidental to 
totemism in savage society, and having set these forth 
by the aid of Mr. Frazer’s admirable study on the 
subject, we ascertain what parallels to these beliefs and 
customs may be found in the folklore of Britain. And 
then our position seems to be very clearly defined. We 
prove that in folklore certain customs and superstitions 
are identical, or nearly so, with the beliefs and customs 
of totemism among savage tribes, and we conclude that 
this identity in form proves an identity in origin, and
-P-A-G-E-338
  286 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
therefore that this section of folklore originated from 
the totemistic people of early Britain. 
I shall not take up all these points on the present 
occasion, especially as they have in all essentials ap- 
peared in the study to which I have referred ; but as an 
example of the scattering of totem beliefs I will refer 
to the well-known passage in Cesar (lib. v. cap. xii.), 
from which we learn that certain people in Britain 
were forbidden to eat the hare, the cock, or the goose, 
and see whether this does not receive its only explana- 
tion by reference to the totemic restriction against 
using the totem for food. Mr. Elton, with this 
passage in his mind, notices that ‘‘there were certain 
restrictions among the Britons and ancient Irish, by 
which particular nations or tribes were forbidden to 
kill or eat certain kinds of animals”; and he goes on to 
suggest that ‘‘it seems reasonable to connect the rule 
of abstaining from certain kinds of food with the 
superstitious belief that the tribes were descended from 
the animals from which their names and crests or 
badges were derived.”! 
Let us see whether this reasonable conjecture holds 
good. The most famous example is that of Cuchu- 
lainn, the celebrated Irish chieftain, whose name means 
the hound of Culain. It is said that he might not eat 
of the flesh of the dog, and he came by his death 
after transgressing this totemistic taboo. The words 
of the manuscript known as the Book of Leinster are 
singularly significant in their illustration of this view. 
‘And one of the things that Cuchulainn was bound 
not to do was going to a cooking hearth and con- 
1 Origins of English History, 297.
-P-A-G-E-339
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 287 
suming the food [z.e. the dog]; and another of the 
things that he must not do was eating his name- 
sake’s flesh.”! Diarmaid, whose name seems to be 
continued in the current popular Irish name for pig 
(Darby), was intimately associated with that animal, 
and his life depended on the life of the boar.? 
These examples are so much to the point that we 
may examine the cases mentioned by Cesar from 
the same standard. 
Mr. Frazer points out that even among existing 
totem-tribes the respect for the totem has lessened or 
disappeared, and among the results of this he notes 
instances where, if any one kills his totem, he apolo- 
gises to the animal. Under such an interpretation as 
this, we may surely classify a ‘‘memorandum ” made 
by Bishop White-Kennett about the hare, the first of 
the British totems mentioned by Cesar: ‘‘ When one 
keepes a hare alive and feedeth him till he have oc- 
casion to eat him, if he telles before he kills him that 
he will doe so, the hare will thereupon be found dead, 
having killed himself.”* But respect for the hare, in 
accordance with totem ideas, was carried further than 
this at Biddenham, where, on the 22nd September, a 
little procession of villagers carried a white rabbit 
[a substitute for hare] decorated with scarlet ribbons 
through the village, singing a hymn in honour of 
St. Agatha. All the young unmarried women who 
chanced to meet the procession extended the first two

fingers of the left hand pointing towards the rabbit, at 
the same time repeating the following doggerel :— 
Gustin, Gustin, lacks a bier, 
Maidens, maidens, bury him here.! 
This points to a very ancient custom, not yet fully 
explained, but which clearly had for its object the 
reverential burying of a rabbit or hare. It is charac- 
teristic of the totem animal that it serves as an omen 
to its clansmen, and we find that the hare is an 
omen in Britain. Boudicca is said to have drawn 
an augury from a hare, taken from her bosom, and 
which when released pursued a course that was deemed 
fortunate for her attack upon the Roman army;? and 
in modern south Northamptonshire the running of a 
hare along the street or mainway of a village portends 
fire to some house in the immediate vicinity. In 1648 
Sir Thomas Browne tells us that in his time there were 
few above three-score years that were not perplexed 
when a hare crossed their path.‘ In Wilts and in 
Scotland it was unlucky to meet a hare, but the evil 
influence did not extend after the next meal had been 
taken.5 Then, too, the prohibition against naming 
the totem object is found in north-east Scotland 
attached to the hare, whose name may not be pro- 
nounced at sea, and Mr. Gregor adds the significant 
fact that some animal names and certain family names

    ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 289 
were never pronounced by the inhabitants of some of 
the villages, each village having an aversion to one 
or more of the words.!_ A classification of the beliefs 
and customs connected with the hare takes us, indeed, 
to almost every phase of totemistic belief, and it is 
impossible to reject such a mass of cumulative evi- 
dence. 
Of the second of the British food taboos mentioned by 
Cesar we have the most perfect illustration in the 
instance of the Irish chieftain, Conaire, who, descended 
from a fowl, was interdicted from eating its flesh.? 
Turning next to the goose, we find that at Great 
Crosby, in Lancashire, there is held an annual 
festival which is called the ‘‘Goose Fair,” and al- 
though it is accompanied by great feasting, the 
singular fact remains that the goose itself, in whose 
honour the feast seems to have been held, is con- 
sidered too sacred to eat, and is never touched by the 
villagers. In Scotland also the goose was never 
eaten, being too sacred for food.‘ 
Thus the hare, the fowl, and the goose have retained 
their sacred character in a special manner in various 
parts of the country, and I may add a further note of 
more general significance. In Scotland there exists 
a prejudice against eating hares and cocks and hens. 
In the south-western parts of England the peasant 
would not eat hares, rabbits, wild-fowl, or poultry, 
and when asked whence this dislike proceeds, he

asserts that it was derived from his father !1—the 
traditional sanction which is so essential to folklore.? 
The ideas surrounding these three special animals 
might be easily extended to others, but I will only 
observe that Mr. Elton, noting both the classical and 
modern accounts of certain districts in Scotland and 
Ireland where fish, though abundant, is tabooed as food, 
quotes with approval a modern suggestion that this 
abstinence was a religious observance.’ That fish 
are carved on numerous stones is a curious commentary 
on this assertion, while another point to be noted is 
that the inhabitants of the various islands have each 
their peculiar notions as to what fish are good for 
food. Some will eat skate, some dog-fish, some eat 
limpets and razor-fish, and as a matter of course, says 
Miss Gordon Cumming, those who do not, despise 
those who do. A prejudice also existed against white 
cows in Scotland, and Dalyell ventures upon the acute 
supposition that this was on account of the unlawful- 
ness of consuming the product of a consecrated 
animal. These are not stray notes of inexperienced 
observers, and with two centuries between them it 
must be that they contain the essence of the people’s 
conception—a conception which leads us back to 
totemism for its explanation.

I do not think we could get closer to totemic beliefs 
and ideas than this, nor could we have a better ex- 
ample of the necessity of examining early historical 
data by anthropological tests and by folklore parallels. 
Czsar’s words are unimportant by themselves. They 
convey nothing of any significance to the modern 
reader—a mere dietetic peculiarity which means nothing 
and counts for nothing. And yet it might be con- 
sidered certain that Cassar knew that the details he 
recorded were of importance in the historical sense. 
He did not indicate what the importance was, prob- 
ably because he was not aware of it; but because 
he was conscious that among the influences which 
counted with these people were the food taboos, he 
rightly recorded the facts. They have remained un- 
considered trifles until now, when anthropology has 
brought them within the range of scientific obser- 
vation, and they are now to be reckoned with as part 
of the material which tells of the culture conditions 
of a section of the early British peoples. 
I must here interpose a remark with reference to 
this grouping of the evidence. Apart from the signifi- 
cance of the superstitions as they are recorded in their 
bare condition among the peasantry, there is the 
additional fact to note that the superstition against 
eating or killing certain animals or birds, or against 
looking at them or naming them, etc., is not universal. 
It obtains in one place and not in another. If the in- 
junction not to kill, injure, or eat a certain animal were 
simply the reflection of a universal practice, such a 
practice might originate in some attribute of the animal 
itself which characteristically would produce or tend to
-P-A-G-E-344
  292 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
produce superstition. But the spread of this class of 
superstition in certain districts, and not in others, is 
indicative of an ancient origin, and it is exactly what 
might be expected to have been produced from totem- 
peoples. Unfortunately, neither the negative evidence 
of superstitious beliefs nor the local distribution of 
superstitious beliefs has ever been considered worthy 
of attention. But some little evidence is incidentally 
forthcoming, and I would submit that this may be 
taken as indicative of what might be obtained more 
fully by further research into this neglected aspect of 
folklore. I drew Miss Burne’s attention to this 
subject, and she has noted some particulars in her 
valuable Shropshire Folklore.‘ But for the most part 
this portion of our evidence wants picking out by a long 
and tedious process from the mass of badly recorded facts 
about popular superstitions. I do not believe in the 
generally stated opinion that certain superstitions are 
universally believed or practised. It is difficult to 
prove a negative, and such evidence is not absolutely 
scientific, but when it comes in direct antithesis to a 
positive, there does not seem any harm in accepting 
it. Every class of superstition wants tracing out 
geographically, and local variants want careful 
noting. I cannot doubt if this were properly done 
that many so-called universal superstitions would be 
found to be distinctly local. In the meantime, it 
is not with universal superstitions that we have to 
deal. It is primarily with those local variants which 
show us side by side the differences of belief. It is

  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 293 
thus that we can afford evidence of that intermixture 
of totem-objects which is to be expected from the 
known facts of totem-beliefs and customs. Indeed, 
Mr. McLennan has laid it down that ‘“‘we might 
expect that while here and there perhaps a tribe 
might appear with a single animal god, as a general 
rule tribes and nations should have as many animal 
and vegetable gods as there were distinct stocks in 
the population . . . we should not expect to find the 
same animal dominant in all quarters, or worshipped 
even everywhere within the same nation.”! 
It is important that we should thoroughly under- 
stand what these survivals of totemism in the British 
isles really mean. On the extreme west coast of 
Ireland, farthest away from the centres of civilisation, 
there are found these unique examples of a savage 
institution. The argument that they might have been 
transplanted thither by travellers from the far west, 
where totemism has developed to its highest form, 
cannot seriously be advanced. The argument that 
they might be the accidental form into which some 
merely superstitious fancies of ignorant peasants 
happened to have ultimately shaped themselves, is 
met by the mathematical demonstration that the ratio 
of chance against such a development would be well- 
nigh incalculable. The remaining argument is that 
they indicate the last outpost, or perhaps one of the 
last outposts, of a primitive savage organisation 
which once existed throughout these lands. This is 
the view that appears to me to be the only possible 
one to meet all the conditions of the case; one proof in 
1 Fortnightly Review, xii. 562.
-P-A-G-E-346
  204 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
support of this view being the discovery of evidence in 
other parts of the country which shows that totemism has 
left its stamp in more or less perfect form upon the tra- 
ditional beliefs and practices of the nation. Though we 
are not able to identify further complete examples of 
the same type as the seal clan of Western Ireland, or 
the wolf people of Ossory, we should be able, if the 
explanation I have advanced of their origin be the 
correct one, to produce examples of the varying forms 
which such an institution as totemism must have 
assumed when it had been broken up by the advance 
of civilising influences. If the seal clan, or the wolf 
clan, is in truth the last outpost of a savage organisa- 
tion, there will be in the lands less remote from the 
centres of civilisation some evidences of the break-up 
of savagery as it has been driven westward. Some- 
where in tradition, somewhere in local observances 
of beliefs or superstition, there must still be echoes, 
more or less faint, but still echoes, from totemism. 
Having discovered these undoubted examples of 
totemism, the argument shifts its ground. We can 
no longer say that the theory of totemism may possibly 
explain some of the customs and traditions of the 
people. We are, by the logic of the position, com- 
pelled to say that custom and tradition must have 
preserved many relics of totemism, and that so far 
from seeking to explain custom and tradition by the 
theory of totemism, we must seek to explain the 
survival of totemism by custom and tradition. I lay 
stress on this view of the case because it is hard to 
combat the views of those who look upon ‘‘ mere super- 
stition” as no explanation of primitive originals. To
-P-A-G-E-347
  ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 295 
us of the present day the beliefs of the peasantry are 
no doubt properly definable as ‘‘mere superstition.” 
But when we examine it as folklore we are seeking for 
its origin, not for its modern aspect; we are asking 
how ‘‘mere superstition” first arose, and in what 
forms, not how it exists; we are pushing back the 
inquiry from to-day when it exists side by side with a 
philosophical and moral religion to the time when it 
existed as the sole substitute for philosophy and 
morals. Even if it is ‘‘mere superstition” it has a 
dateless history. It is not conceivable that it suddenly 
arose at a particular period before which ‘‘mere 
superstition ” did not exist, and all, both peasant and 
chief, were philosophical and moral. It is not con- 
ceivable that the mere superstition of to-day has re- 
placed bodily the mere superstition of other ages. 
Every succeeding age of progress has influenced it, 
no doubt, but not eradicated it, and hence the mere 
superstition of to-day has just such an unbroken con- 
tinuity of history as language or institutions. That 
we are able to pick out from among its items un- 
doubted forms of totemism, and that we may add to 
these complete examples a classified grouping of 
customs and beliefs in survival parallel to the customs 
and beliefs of savage totemism, affords proof that at 
least we may carry back that history to the era of 
totemism, at whatever point that era may cross the line 
of, or come into contact with, political history. 
This is the definite conclusion to be drawn from 
the anthropological interpretation of the presence of 
totemic beliefs among the survivals of folklore. The 
study of the anthropological conditions has occupied 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
  296 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
a wide range of thought and inquiry, but it leads 
us back to a safe basis for research, for it brings 
definitely within touch of that realm of man which lies 
outside the civilisation wherein folklore is embedded, 
the peoples who have made, and the peoples who are 
dominated by, that civilisation. The savage of Britain 
cannot with this evidence before us be considered as the 
mere product of the literature of Greece and Rome. He 
is part and parcel of the savagery of the human race. 
Anthropology has shown us that savagery reached the 
land we now call Britain as part of the general move- 
ment of people which has caused the whole earth to 
become a dwelling-place for man, and now that we 
know this we must appeal to anthropology whenever 
we find that the problems of folklore take us out of the 
culture period of a civilisation known to history.! 
1 It is just possible that the value of investigating Australian totemism 
may prove to have a still more direct bearing upon British folklore, for 
Huxley's opinion as to the Australoid race is not entirely to be neglected, 
He argued that ‘‘The Australoid race are dark complexion, ranging 
through various shades of light and dark chocolate colour; dark or 
black eyes; the hair of the scalp black and soft, silky and wavy; the 
skull dolichocephalic. The great continent of Australia is the head- 
quarters of the Australoid race. . . . The Dekkan, which is so remark- 
ably isolated on the north by the valleys of the Ganges and Indus, 
beyond these by the Himalaya Mountains, and on the east and west by 
the sea, was originally inhabited, and is still largely peopled by men 
who completely come under the definition of the Australoid race given 
above. In Abyssinia and Egypt there is a smooth-haired, dark-com- 
plexioned, long-headed stock which I am strongly inclined to regard as 
a westward extension of the Australoid race. I would venture to suggest 
that the dark whites who stretch from Northern Hindostan through 
Western Asia, skirt both shores of the Mediterranean, and extend 
through Western Europe to Ireland, may have had their origin in a 
prolongation of the Australoid race, which has become modified by 
selection or intermixture” (Huxley in Prehistoric Congress, 1868, pp. 
92-94). This point of view is confirmed by Mr. Mathew’s conclusions,

APPENDIX 
I append a synopsis of the culture-structure of the 
Semangs of the Malay Peninsula (references are to 
Skeat and Blagden’s Pagan Races of the Malay 
Peninsula where not otherwise specified), in order that 
the position claimed for the one section of totemic 
belief may be tested by the remaining characteristics 
of Semang culture. I claim that there is nothing that 
remains which is inconsistent with the interpretation 
given of the totemic items. 
Physical :— 
(a). Live exclusively in the forest surrounded by 
hostile fauna (i. 13). 
(6). Food consists of such wild vegetable food as 
may happen to fall from time to time in season (i. 109, 
341, 525), together with small mammals and birds 
(i. 112), fish (i. 113). 
(c). As soon as they have exhausted the sources of 
food in one neighbourhood they move on to the next 
(i. 109). 
(@). Fire obtained by friction (i. 111, 113), but meat 
is eaten raw (i. 112). 
(e). Nudity is alleged (Journ. Indian Archipelago, 
i. 252; ii, 258); no satisfactory proof (i. 137); do not 
use skins of animals nor feathers of birds (i. 138); a 
girdle of fungus string (i. 138, 142, 380); fringe of 
leaves suspended from a string (i. 139, 142); necklaces 
and ligatures of jungle fibre (i. 144, 145); women wear 
a comb made of bamboo as a charm against diseases 
(i. 149). 
 
-P-A-G-E-350
  298 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
(f). Habitations are rock shelters (i. 173), tree shelters 
afforded by branches of trees improved by construction 
of a weather screen (i. 174); ground screen of palm 
leaves (i. 175). 
(g). Hunt successfully the largest animals, escaping 
easily up the trees (i. 202-204). 
(2). Knives made of bamboo, flakes and chips of stone, 
knives of bone (i. 249, 269); bow and arrow (i. 251, 255); 
not sufficiently advanced to have produced neolithic 
implements (i. 268); wooden spear (i. 270). 
(z). Ignorant of pottery, vessels made from big stems 
of bamboo (i. 383). 
Social :— 
(7). Chief of the group is the principal medicine man, 
but is on an equal footing with his men, no caste and 
property is in common (i. 497, 499). 
(Rk). Marriage rights are secured by the presentation 
of a jungle knife to the bride’s parents and a girdle to 
the bride, and the bride never lets the girdle part from 
her for fear of its being used to her prejudice in some 
magic ceremony; adultery is punishable by death 
(ii. 58, 59) [but this information was not obtained from 
the most primitive of the Semang people]. 
(2). Semang women are common to all men (Newbold, 
Political and Stat. Acc. of Settlements in Straits of 
Malacca, ii. 379). Great ante-nuptial freedom (ii. 56, 
218); ‘Of the Semang I have not had an opportunity 
of personally judging” (ii. 377, Newbold). 
(m). Eat dead kindred except head (Newbold, ii. 379); 
burial takes place in the ground, and the older practice

was exposure in trees; the Semang have no dread of 
ghosts of the deceased (ii. 89, 91). 
(2). No sacred shrines or places (ii. 197). 
(0). Avoidance of mother-in-law (ii. 204). 
(f). Myth of the ringdove informing the children of 
the first woman that they had married within prohibited 
degrees of consanguinity, and advising them to separate 
and marry “‘ other people” (ii. 218). 
(g). Myth as to ignorance of cause of birth being 
dispelled by the cocoanut monkey informing the first 
man and woman (ii. 218). 
(r). The Semang are almost ineradicably nomadic, 
have no fixed habitation, and rove about like the beasts 
of the forest (i. 172; ii. 470). 
(s). Women and girls are not allowed to eat until the 
men and boys have finished their repast (i. 116); the 
men do most of the hunting and trapping, and the 
women take a large share in the collecting of roots and 
fruits ; all the cooking is performed by the women and 
girls (i. 375). 
(2). They are split up into a large number of dialects, 
each of which is confined to a relatively small area, and 
it often happens that a little [clan] or even a single family 
uses a form of speech which is differentiated from other 
dialects to be practically unintelligible to all except the 
members of the little community itself (ii. 379). 
(w). Natural segregation of the [tribes] into small 
[clans] to some extent cut off from one another and 
surrounded by settled Malay communities (ii. 379).
-P-A-G-E-354
  300 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
(v). The most thoroughly wild and uncivilised 
members of our race, regarded by the Malays as little 
better than brute beasts, with no recorded history 
(ii. 384). 
(w). Nomadic life of the Semang leads them over a 
considerable tract of country (ii. 388). 
Psychical :— 
(x). Decorative patterns on quivers representing 
natural objects, and possessing magical virtue to bring 
down various species of monkeys and apes and other 
small mammals (i. 417), and as charms for the 
men (i. 423). 
(vy). Decorative pattern on magic comb worn by 
women to serve as a charm against venomous reptiles 
and insects, similar design for similar reason some- 
times painted on the breast (i. 41, 420-436). 
(z). Child’s name is taken from some tree which 
stands near the prospective birthplace of the child. 
As soon as the child is born this name is shouted aloud 
by the sage femme, who then hands over the child to 
another woman, who buries the afterbirth underneath 
the birth-tree or name-tree of the child. As soon as 
this is done the father cuts a series of notches in the 
tree, starting from the ground and terminating at the 
height of the breast. The cutting of these notches is 
intended to signalise the arrival on earth of a new 
human being, since it thus shows that Kari registers 
the souls that he has sent forth by notching the tree 
against which he leans. Trees thus “blazed” are 
never felled. The child must not in later life injure 
any tree which belongs to the species of his tree; for
-P-A-G-E-355
  
ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS gor 
him all such trees are taboo, and he must not even eat 
their fruit, the only exception being when an ex- 
pectant mother revisits her birth-tree. Every tree 
of its species is regarded as identical with the birth- 
tree (ii. 3, 4). When an East Semang dies his birth- 
tree dies too (ii. 5). 
(aa). The child’s soul is conveyed in a bird, which 
always inhabits a tree of the species to which the birth- 
tree belongs. It flies from one tree of the species to 
another, following the as yet unborn body. The souls 
of first-born children are always young birds newly 
hatched, the offspring of the bird which contained the 
soul of the mother. If the mother does not eat the 
soul-bird during her accouchement the child will be 
stillborn or will die shortly after birth (ii. 4, 192, 194, 
216). She keeps the soul-bird within the birth-bamboo, 
and does not eat it all at once, but piecemeal (ii. 6). 
All human souls grow upon a soul-tree in the other 
world, whence they are fetched by a bird which was 
killed and eaten by the expectant mother (ii. 194). 
(60). Semang religion, in spite of its recognition of 
a thunder-god (Kari) and certain minor deities (so 
called), has very little indeed in the way of ceremonial, 
and appears to consist mainly of mythology and 
legend. It shows remarkably few traces of demon 
worship, very little fear of ghosts of the deceased, and 
still less of any sort of animistic beliefs (ii. 174). 
[As the Kari is the deity common to the Semang 
and the people higher in culture than the Semang, 
it is difficult to trace out the primitive idea. The 
myths also show a common impress, ‘‘which is
-P-A-G-E-356
  302 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
probably mainly due to the same savage Malay ele- 
ment”? (ii. 183).] 
(cc). During a storm of thunder and lightning the 
Semang draw a few drops of blood from the region of 
the shin bone, mix it with a little water in a bamboo 
receptacle, and throw it up to the angry skies (ii. 204). 
(dd). Pretend entire ignorance of a supreme being, 
but on pressure confessed to a very powerful yet 
benevolent being, the maker of the world (ii. 209).
-P-A-G-E-357
  CHAPTER V 
SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
ERHAPS the most important part of the anthro- 
pological aspect of custom, rite, and belief in 
tradition is sociological. Perhaps, too, it is the 
most neglected. Inquirers into the origin of religion 
proceed one after the other to investigate the phenomena 
of early beliefs as they interpret the origin of religion, 
without one thought of the sociological conditions of the 
problem. They interpose, as I have already pointed out, 
the theory of a state religion, when such a foundation is 
incidentally found to be necessary to carry the imposing 
superstructure of Celtic mythology, but they do not 
pause to inquire whether the state, suddenly introduced 
into the argument, is a discoverable factor; or they 
proceed to erect their superstructure of religious origins 
without any social foundation whatever, and we are 
left with a great concept of abstract thought having no 
roots in the source from which it is supposed to be 
drawn. The sun-god and the dawn-god, even the 
All-father, are traced in the most primitive thought of 
man, but it is not deemed necessary to show in what 
relation these concepts stand to practical life. It is 
here I must refer back to Robertson-Smith’s dictum on 
mythology, for it is the necessary preliminary to show- 
ing that belief cannot enter into life except through the 
303 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
    304 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
sociological units into which all humanity fits itself; or 
rather, I would prefer Robertson-Smith’s way of putting 
it, ‘‘the circle into which a man was born was not 
simply a human society, a circle of kinfolk and fellow- 
citizens, but embraced also certain divine beings, the 
gods of the family and the state, which to the ancient 
mind were as much a part of the particular community 
with which they stood connected as the human members 
of the social group.”! Any proposal to examine a 
group of customs, beliefs, and rites which at their 
origin take us back to the earliest history of a country 
must, therefore, be considered from the sociological 
side. The great mass of the material to be used in such 
an inquiry is not ancient so far as its date of record is 
a test of antiquity, but it is ancient as traditional 
survival, and it is not possible to trace back custom and 
belief surviving in modern times to the earliest times, 
except through the medium of the institutions which 
formed the social basis of the peoples to whom such 
custom and belief belonged. A custom or belief exists 
as a living force before it sinks back into the position of 
a survival. It is the lingering effect of this living force 
which helps to preserve it for so many ages, and in 
the midst of such adverse circumstances, as a survival 
among other customs and beliefs existing under a 
different living force. It is not possible, therefore, to 
1 Religion of the Semites, 30. It is worth while quoting here Merivale’s 
note in his Boyle lectures, Conversion of the Northern Nations, 122. 
“Pagan temples were always the public works of nations and com- 
munities. They were national buildings dedicated to national purposes, 
The medizval churches, on the other hand, were the erection of in- 
dividuals, monuments of personal piety, tokens of the hope of a personal 
reward,” Cf Stanley, Hist. Westminster Abbey, 12.
-P-A-G-E-359
    SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 305 
ascertain the origin of custom or belief in survival, 
except as a fragment of the social institution to which 
it originally belonged. No custom or belief has a life 
of its own separate from all other. It is joined to 
other customs and beliefs in indissoluble co-partner- 
ship, the whole group making up the institutions under 
which the race or people to whom they belong live and 
flourish. This, as we have already seen, is a most 
important principle in the study of survivals. Not only 
is it strictly true of all primitive peoples, but it is true 
of the early stages of more advanced communities.! 
Indeed it has been put into a phrase used long ago by 
an English writer on the manorial tenant, ‘‘His religion 
is a part of his copyhold,”? and when the jurist talks 
to us in highly technical language of lords, freeholders, 
villans, and serfs, we must bear in mind that at any rate 
these villans and serfs belonged to a social institu- 
tion, one element of which was religion. So, too, must 
the folklorist bear in mind that it is not the individual 
belief he is concerned with, but with the belief that 
belongs toa community. It must be assumed that the 
true test of the antiquity of every custom or belief is its 
natural and easy assimilation with other customs and 
beliefs, equally with itself in the position of a survival, 
and the recognition of the whole group thus brought 
into relationship as belonging to the institutions of the 
people from whom it is derived. 
1 Mr. Granger has a very instructive passage on this point in his 
Worship of the Romans, 210-214; of. Robertson-Smith, Religion of the 
Semites, lec. ii.; Mr. MacDonald, Africana, i. 64, notes, too, that “the 
natives worship not so much individually as in villages or communities.” 
Prof. Sayce, studying early religion, says in its outward form it ‘‘was 
made up of rites and ceremonies which could only be performed collec- 
tively.” —Science of Language, ii. 290. Clarke’s Survey of the Lakes, 36.

-P-A-G-E-360
  306 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
It is well to understand what this condition of things 
exactly means as an element in the study of early 
beliefs. It will be dealing with beliefs from their place 
in the social habitat ; housing them, so to speak, within 
the groups of human beings with which they are con- 
nected. It will be considering them as part of the living 
organism which the social units of man have created. 
All this indicates a method of treating the subject 
entirely different from what has hitherto obtained. 
Students of early English institutions are content to 
construct elaborate arguments from the often conflicting 
testimony of historical authorities; students of early 
beliefs construct elaborate systems of religious thought 
far above the custom and rite with which they are deal- 
ing. The two branches of the same subject are never 
brought together to illustrate each other. Early insti- 
tutions cannot be separated from early beliefs. Early 
beliefs cannot properly be separated from the society of 
which they form a component part. We require to 
know not only what beliefs a particular people possess, 
but in what manner these beliefs generate custom and 
rite and take their place: among the influences which 
affect the social organism. Early man does not live 
individually. His life is part of a collective group. 
The group worships collectively as it lives collectively, 
and it is extremely important to work out the dual con- 
ditions. If the several items of custom and belief pre- 
served by tradition are really ancient in their origin, 
they must be floating fragments, as it were, of an 
ancient system of custom and belief—the cultus of the 
people among whom they originated. This cultus has 
been destroyed, struggling unsuccessfully against 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 307 
foreign and more vigorous systems of religion and 
society. To be of service to history each floating frag- 
ment of ancient custom and belief must not only be 
labelled ‘‘ancient,” but it must be placed back in the 
system from which it has been torn away. To do this 
is toa great extent to restore the ancient system; and 
to restore an ancient system of culture, even if the 
restoration be only a mosaic and a shattered mosaic, 
is to bring into evidence the people to which it 
belongs. 
In the previous chapter it was necessary to lay some- 
what special stress upon the system of social organisa- 
tion known as totemism, which was not founded upon 
kinship. This was traced in survival among the pre- 
Celtic peoples of Britain. If we now turn to the Celts 
and Teutons of Britain we shall find that we have to 
deal with a social organisation founded definitely upon 
kinship; and if there are survivals of belief, custom, and 
rite, derived from this kinship system, existing side by 
side in the same culture area with survivals from the 
kinless system, it will be necessary to explain how two 
such opposite streams can have been kept flowing. 
It is not difficult in the case of countries occupied by 
Celtic or Teutonic peoples to ascertain what the par- 
ticular institution was which linked together the beliefs 
of the people, though it is not easy to trace out all the 
phases of it. It is the tribe—that system of society 
which appears as the means by which Greek and 
Roman, Celt and Teuton, Scandinavian and Slav, 
Hindu and Persian, were able to conquer, overrun, 
and finally to settle in the lands which they have 
made their own. We know something of the Celtic  
-P-A-G-E-362
  308 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
tribe, less of the Teutonic tribe, but all we know is that 
it possesses features in common with the tribe of its 
kindred. There is no fact more certainly true as a 
result of comparative research than that the tribe is the 
common heritage of those people who have become the 
dominant rulers of the Indo-European world. I use 
this term ‘‘ tribe” in no formal sense, not in the sense 
of its Roman derivation and use, which shows it quite 
as a secondary institution, but as the most convenient 
term to define that grouping of men with wives, families, 
and descendants, and all the essentials of independent 
life, which is found as a primal unit of European 
society in a state of unsettlement as regards land or 
country. The tie which bound all together was per- 
sonal not local, kinship with a tribal god, kinship more 
or less real with fellow-tribesmen, kinship in status and 
rights. We meet with this tribal organisation every- 
where in Indo-European history. It made movement 
from country to country possible. It made conquest 
possible. Celt and Teuton did not conquer in families 
any more than Greek or Hindu did. They conquered 
in tribes, and it was because of the strength of the 
tribal organisation during the period, first of migration 
and wandering and then of conquest, that the settle- 
ment after conquest was possible and was so strong. 
Everywhere we find these people conquerors and settlers. 
In India, in Iran, in Greece and Rome, in Scandinavia, 
in Celtic and Teutonic Europe, in Slavic Europe, they 
are moving tribes of conquerors come to settle and rule 
the people they conquer. When Dr. Ridgeway asks 
1 Pritchard’s Researches into the Physical Hist. of Mankind, vol. iii., 
may still be consulted for an account of the tribal movements in Europe.
-P-A-G-E-363
  SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 309 
whence came the Acheans,! he answers the question 
much in the same fashion as that in which Dr. Duncker 
describes the settlement on the Ganges :— 
‘“‘The ancient population of the new states on the Ganges 
was not entirely extirpated, expelled, or enslaved. Life and 
freedom were allowed to those who submitted and conformed 
to the law of the conqueror ; they might pass their lives as 
servants on the farms of the Aryas (Manu, i. gr). But 
though the remnant of this population was spared, the whole 
body of the immigrants looked down on them with the pride 
of conquerors—of superiority in arms, blood, and character— 
and in contrast to them they called themselves Vaic¢yas, i.e. 
tribesmen, comrades, in other words those who belong to the 
community or body of rulers. Whether the Vaicya belonged 
to the order of the nobles, the minstrels and priests or 
peasants, was a matter of indifference, he regarded the old 
inhabitants as an inferior species of mankind. . . . In the 
new states on the Ganges therefore the population was 
separated into two sharply divided masses. How could the 
conquerors mix with the conquered? How could their pride 
stoop to any union with the despised servants? ”? 
These two divided masses thus so clearly described 
were, in fact, tribesmen and non-tribesmen, just that dis- 
tinction which we meet with in Celtic and Teutonic law, 
and described in the same terms which Bishop Stubbs 
was obliged to use when he set forth the facts of the 
Teutonic invasion of Britain. 
The terms are indeed necessary terms. Tribesmen 
capable of retaining the tribal organisation during the 
period of migration and conquest did not lightly lose 
that organisation when they settled. In Sir Alfred

Lyall’s pure genealogic clan of Central India! I 
recognise the unbroken tribal formation before the 
family group has arisen as a political unit. In Mr. 
Tupper’s argument against the conclusions of Sir 
Henry Maine I recognise the Hindu evidence that the 
tribe was the earliest social group, breaking up, as later 
influences arose, into village communities and joint 
families? In Bishop Stubbs’s masterly analysis of 
English constitutional history the tribe appears at the 
outset—‘‘the invaders,” he says, ‘‘came in families 
and kindreds and in the full organisation of their tribes 
. . . the tribe was as complete when it had removed to 
Kent as when it stayed in Jutland; the magistrate was 
the ruler of the tribe not of the.soil ; the divisions were 
those of the folk and the host not of the land; the laws 
were the usage of the nation not of the territory.”* 
And so I agree with Mr. Skene as to the Celtic tribe 
that ‘‘the tuath or tribe preceded the fine or clan,”* 
and with the editors of the Irish law tracts that ‘‘the 
tribe existed before the family came into being and 
continued to exist after the latter had been dissolved.”® 
We need not go beyond this evidence. The tribe is 
the common form into which the early Indo-European 
peoples grouped themselves for the purpose of conquest 
and settlement. It was their primal unit. It may 
have been numerically large or small. It may have

been the result of a combination of many smaller 
tribes into one great tribe. But in any case and under 
any conditions there stands out the tribal organisation, 
that great institutional force from which spring all 
later institutions. Its roots go back into the remotest 
past of Indo-European history ; its active force caused 
the Indo-European people to become the mightiest in 
human history; its lasting results have scarcely yet 
ceased to shape the aspirations of political society and 
to affect the destinies of nations. The whole life of the 
early period was governed by tribal conditions—the 
political, social, legal, andeven religious conceptions 
were tribal in form and expression. 
The tribal institution of the Aryan-speaking peoples 
includes a life outside the tribe. That was an outlaw’s 
life, a kinless outcast, whom no tribesman would look 
upon or assist, whom every tribesman considered as an 
enemy until he had reduced him to the position of helot 
or slave, but for whom every tribe had a place in its 
organisation and a legal status in its constitution. But 
it was the legal status imposed by the master over the 
servant, and the kinless included not only the outcast 
from the tribe, but the conquered aboriginal who had 
never been within the tribe. It is important to notice 
this, for it to some extent measures the strength of the 
tribal organisation. It not only allowed for a special 
position for all tribesmen, but it allowed for that posi- 
tion to have a definite relationship to persons who were 
not tribesmen, and it is in the combined forces of 
tribesmen and non-tribesmen that the tribal organisa- 
tion which swept over part of Asia and over all Europe 
obtains its greatest power. There are tribal systems
-P-A-G-E-366
  312 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
outside the Semitic and the Indo-European, but these 
do not have the distinctive features that the tribal 
systems of these two great civilising peoples possess. 
Like the Semitic and Aryan tribal systems, savage 
tribes are fashioned for conquest, but, unlike them, 
they are not fashioned for settlement and _ resettle- 
ment, and perhaps again and again conquest and re- 
settlement. They spent all their power, or most of 
their power, in their one great effort of conquest, and 
whether we turn to the American Indian tribes, to the 
African tribes, or to the Asiatic tribes we find the same 
facts of frequent dissipation of power after sudden and 
complete conquest of it. The tribal system which led 
to civilisation has a different history. It has, too, a 
different constitution in that to the strength of tribes- 
men was added the subordination—politically, industri- 
ally, and economically—of non-tribesmen. They were 
the people who, in the terms of the northern poem, 
‘* Laid fences, 
Enriched the plough lands, 
Tended swine, 
Herded goats, 
Dug peat.”’! 
Unfortunately the institution of the tribe has never 
been properly studied by the great authorities in his- 
tory, and students are left without guidance in this 
important matter. And yet in any attempt to get back 
to the earliest period of history in lands governed by 
an Aryan-speaking people we must proceed, can only 
proceed, on the basis of the tribe, and it is the failure to

  SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 313 
understand this which has made so much early history 
unsatisfactory and inconclusive and compels us to the 
conclusion that the master-hand is still needed to re- 
write in terms of tribal history all that has been written 
in terms merely of political history. 
If, however, history from the written records is thus 
at fault, so too is history from the traditional records. 
No systematic effort has been made to treat the tradi- 
tional story or the traditional custom and belief as part 
of the tribal history of our race, and yet in the few 
cases where it has been so treated the results are obvi- 
ously satisfactory. I can illustrate the value of this 
point of view by an example drawn from the period 
which witnessed the earliest struggles of our race. I 
think with Mr. Keary that in those German stories 
“‘which delight above all things in that portrait of the 
youngest son of the house—he is the youngest of 
three—who is left behind despised and neglected when 
his brothers go forth to seek their fortunes,” we have 
traces of a veritable fact, of an historical condition 
where the elder sons actually went forth to conquest 
and to settlement and the youngest son remained in 
the original home as the hearth-child.!_ The position 
of hearth-child, surviving as it does in our law of 
Borough English, is of great significance, and that we 
can by the aid of tradition reach a state of society 
which gave birth to it is a point of the greatest import- 
ance, even if we could go no further. But there is a 
stage beyond it. The majority of these youngest-son

hood of Fiction, devotes a chapter to the clever-youngest-son group of 
tales (cap. xiii.), which should be consulted.

  314, FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
stories relate to events not to be identified with any 
particular tribe or people, but which belong to all the 
tribes and peoples whose course of conquest and settle- 
ment took the common form. But if apart from these 
all-world stories there exist stories, or if there be but 
one story which has become identified with an episode, 
a person, or a place belonging to a particular people, 
we may claim it as part of the history of that particular 
people. It may be that the general story has become 
specialised in this one case, or it may be that an entirely 
new story has sprung out of the special case. But 
whichever be the origin of such a story attached to a 
particular people, it must tell us something of that 
people at a period when its history was being made 
rather than recorded. What it tells may be very little, 
may not lead up to anything very great or definite, so 
far as later history is concerned; but that for the period 
to which it belongs it relates to an episode worthy to 
have been kept in the memories of the descendants of 
the chief actors in the events is the point to bear in 
mind. 
There is one such story which belongs to English 
history. One of the most famous of these youngest- 
son stories is that of Childe Rowland, and Mr. Jacobs, 
on examining its incidents and details, suggests that 
“our story may have a certain amount of historic basis 
and give a record which history fails to give of the 
very earliest conflict of races in these isles.”1 Mr. 
Jacobs gives good grounds for this conclusion, and 
shows up a picture of earliest English history which 
is certainly not contained elsewhere, and we are able 
1 Folklore, ii. 194.

    SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 315 
by this means to pass from that large group of young- 
est-son stories, which have brought with them living 
testimony of an ancient institution of our race in its 
oldest home, to the narrower but more direct example 
which comes to us from events which happened just at 
the dawn of history in our own land. It is not neces- 
sary to emphasise the importance of this service to 
history at the instance of tradition, for it will be obvious 
to every student that many a struggle must have re- 
mained unrecorded and many a hero must have died 
unnamed in the events which belong to the period of 
tribal conquest and settlement. And to have still with 
us the far-off echo of these events is no slight en- 
couragement to an inquiry which has for its object the 
reconstruction of the conditions under which such 
events took place. 
This would be all the better understood if we could get 
a concrete case for illustration, and, fortunately, this is 
possible by turning to the evidence of India. ‘‘ What 
we know of the manner in which the states of Upper 
India were founded,” says Sir Alfred Lyall, 
“‘ gives a very fair sample of the movements and changes of 
the primitive world. When the dominant Rajput families lost 
their dominion in the rich Gangetic plains one part of their 
clan seems to have remained in the conquered country, 
having submitted to the foreigner, cultivating in strong 
communities of villages and federations of villages and 
paying such land tax as the ruler could extract. Another 
part of the clan, probably the near kinsmen of the defeated 
chief, followed his family into exile, and helped him to carve 
out another, but a much poorer, dominion. Here the chief 
built himself a fort upon the hill; his clansmen slew or 
subdued the tribes they found in possession of the soil, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
  
316 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
the lands were all parcelled off among the chief’s kinsfolk, 
the indigenous proprietors being subjected to payment of 
a land tax, but not otherwise degraded.. When the land grew 
too strait for the support of the chief’s family or of the sept— 
that is, when there were no vacant allotments, a landless son 
of the chief would assemble a band, and set forth to make 
room for himself elsewhere.” ! 
The evidence from India is fact, the evidence from 
England is tradition, and yet I do not think any 
student will deny that both fact and tradition are 
part and parcel of the same conditions of society, the 
same forces operating upon the same material. The 
conditions of society in both cases are tribal conditions, 
and the common factor having thus been discovered, 
it is possible to determine not only the inter-relationship 
between fact and tradition, but the means by which we 
may estimate the value of both. 
We cannot, however, stop here. I carry on the 
same argument from the traditional legend to the 
traditional custom and belief, and affirm that it is only 
by their position as part of the tribal system that custom 
and belief in survival must be tested. If they have de- 
scended from early Celtic or Teutonic custom and be- 
lief, they have descended from tribal custom and belief, 
and somewhere in the stages of descent will be found the 
link which connects them definitely with the tribe. That 
not all custom and belief has so descended is due to the 
fact that much of it belongs to the pre-Celtic period, 
which was not tribal; some of it, no doubt, to compara- 
tively modern times, when, as we have already seen, 
superstition had taken the place of thought, while 
1 Sir A. Lyall, Asiatic Studies, 184, and compare pp. 198, 208, 211.
-P-A-G-E-371
  SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 317 
some phases of early belief belong to conditions which 
transcend the division between pre-Aryan and Aryan 
folk. On this I will say something by way of ex- 
planation presently. In the meantime it isan extremely 
important task to classify survivals into tribal and non- 
tribal groups. Those which belong to Celtic or 
Teutonic origins must show their tribal origin, for they 
could not have come into existence apart from the tribe, 
and apart from the tribe they could not have survived 
after the break-up of the tribe consequent upon the 
development of national and political life. Custom 
and belief which do not fit into the ancient tribal 
system, therefore, cannot be recognised as ancient 
Celtic or ancient Teutonic custom and belief, and con- 
trariwise when it is seen that they naturally fall into 
this system it may be argued that there we must search 
for their origin. Our Anglo-Saxon forefathers have 
left a curious testimony to this view of the question in 
their word ‘‘holy”” or wholesome. What is wholesome 
is so for the whole group. The Anglo-Saxon idea of 
holiness implies as its chief element relation to the 
tribal life. 
The classification of survivals in folklore into tribal 
and non-tribal items is a lengthy and intricate process. 
Some years ago I made a start in a study of fire wor- 
ship which I presented to the British Association,? and 
I hope shortly to be ready with a volume on Zribal 
Custom, which will embody a fuller study of fire wor-

ship and its accompanying beliefs, together with 
a complete study of all the remains of traditional 
custom, rite, and belief, which only as the detritus 
of the ancient tribal organisation receive adequate 
explanation of their presence in the midst of modern 
political and religious institutions. If I leave this 
part of my subject without further illustration in 
this present volume, I must add one important 
note upon the persistence of survivals of both kinless 
and kinship societies. I have shown that the tribal 
system of the advanced races included provision 
for non-tribesmen, provision which kept non-tribes- 
men outside the tribal bond, and at the same time 
kept them tied to the tribe by using them as the 
necessary dependent adjunct of the tribe, using them 
as bondmen and serfs in point of fact. This ex- 
tremely important factor in the history of the tribal 
organisation, which has not been properly noticed by 
the few authorities who have investigated tribal institu- 
tions, receives additional importance when viewed from 
the standpoint of folklore, for it allows for the preserva- 
tion of non-tribal cults side by side with tribal cults. 
Non-tribesmen preserved their custom, belief, and rite 
simply because they were not admitted to the custom, 
belief, and rite of the tribe, and this is the explanation 
of the existence, in survival, of folklore which goes 
back to pre-Celtic times. Some of this pre-Celtic 
folklore we have already had before us, and some 
of it I have studied in my Z¢thnology in Folklore. 
Later on I shall have something more to say on the 
subject. Here it is only necessary to emphasise the 
importance of having ascertained why it is that the
-P-A-G-E-373
  SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 319 
Celtic conquerors of Britain and the earliest tribal con- 
querors of the Indo-European world generally per- 
mitted to live in their midst what in a sense was 
opposed to all that they believed, to all that they 
practised, to all that governed them in thought and 
action. 
I think this is a strong position upon which to con- 
duct folklore research. It includes the whole of the his- 
torical position; it takes due count of historical facts 
instead of ignoring them. It is based upon a scientific 
conception of the meaning of a survival of culture. A 
survival is that which has been left stranded amidst 
the development that is going on around. Its future 
life is not one of development but of decay. We 
are not dealing with the evolution of society, but 
with the decaying fragments of a social system which 
has passed away. We have to trace out its line of 
decay from the point where it almost vanishes as the 
mere superstition or practice of a peasant or an out- 
cast, back to phases where it exists in more strenuous 
fashion, and finally back to its original position as 
part and parcel of a living social fabric. Moreover, 
the strength of our position is based upon a scientific 
conception of the development of the nation or people 
among whom survivals exist. It is not all parts of the 
nation which develop at the same rate, at the same time, 
and for the same period. There are social strata in 
every country, and it is the observance of these strata 
which has made it possible for the inquirer of to-day to 
use the evidence they afford for historical purposes.

  CHAPTER VI 
EUROPEAN CONDITIONS 
HERE are obviously conditions attaching to 
European culture history which do not apply 
elsewhere, and as obviously the most important, 
perhaps the only important one, which it is necessary 
to consider in connection with the problems of folklore 
is that resulting from the introduction of a non-Euro- 
pean religion and the adoption of this religion as part 
of the state machinery in the several countries. This 
religion is, of course, Christianity. It came into the 
home of a decaying, corrupt, and impossible state 
religion wherever the Roman Empire was established 
and into the homes of purer and sterner faiths, faiths 
that had belonged to the people through all the years 
of conquest and settlement, migration and resettle- 
ment, wherever the empire of Rome had not become 
established. 
Until the advent of Christianity into Britain the 
Celtic peoples possessed their own customs, their own 
religious beliefs, their own usages. Until the Anglo- 
Saxons came into contact with Christianity in their 
new settlements in England, they also possessed their 
own customs, usages, and beliefs. So far as Celt and 
Teuton were responsible for continuing or allowing to 
continue the still older faiths, the faiths of savagery as 
320
-P-A-G-E-375
  EUROPEAN CONDITIONS 321 
we have accustomed ourselves to term them, they 
brought these faiths also into contact with Christianity, 
and Christianity dealt with the problem thus presented 
exactly as it dealt with the Celtic and Teutonic faiths, 
namely, by treating all alike as pagan, all equally to 
be set aside or used in any fashion that circumstances 
might demand. Let it be particularly noted that 
Christianity did not distinguish between the various 
shades of paganism. All that was not Christian was 
pagan. 
Christianity was both antagonistic to and tolerant 
of pagan custom and belief. In principle and pur- 
pose it was antagonistic. In practice it was tolerant 
where it could tolerate safely. At the centre it aimed 
at purity of Christian doctrine, locally it permitted 
pagan practices to be continued under Christian aus- 
pices. In the earliest days it set itself against all 
forms of idolatry and non-Christian practices; in later 
days, after the fifth century, says Gibbon, it accepted 
both pagan practice and pagan ritual. 
The relationship of Christianity to paganism is, 
therefore, a very complex subject, and it would not be 
possible in this place to work out one tithe of it. Nor 
is it needed. The two cardinal facts with which we are 
now concerned are the principle of antagonism and the 
practice of toleration. As to the former there need not 
be any discussion on the fact. Everywhere throughout 
Europe its effect is to be seen. It formed the most 
solid and systematic arresting force against the natural 
development of pagan belief and practice, and it is 
this fact of arrested development in pagan belief and 
1 Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (Bury), iii. 214-15. 
Y 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  322 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
practice which is of great importance. We can ascer- 
tain the point of stoppage, note the stage of arrested 
development, and trace out the subsequent history of a 
custom, belief, or rite so arrested. As a survival in a 
state of arrested development, a custom or belief is 
observable throughout its later history. All it does is 
to decay, and decay slowly, and each stage of decay 
may oftentimes be discovered. On the other hand, if 
no arrest of development had taken place there would 
have been no survival and no decay. The custom or 
belief which is not arrested by an opposing culture 
becomes a part of the religion or of the institutions of 
the nation, and the history of its development becomes, 
as a rule, lost in the general advance of religion and 
politics—custom develops into law, belief develops into 
religion, rite develops into ceremonial, and tradition 
ceases to be the force which keeps them alive. The 
two classes of custom and belief thus contrasted are of 
different value to the student. The one is important 
because it contains the germs and goes back to the 
origin of existing institutions. The other is important 
because, having been arrested by a strong opposing 
force, unable to destroy it altogether, it remains as 
evidence of custom and belief at the time of its arrest- 
ment. It will be seen at once how far this evidence 
may take us. It stretches back into the remotest past. 
It survives in the stage at which it was arrested, not of 
course in the form in which it then appeared, but in the 
decayed form which years of existence beneath the 
ever-opposing forces of the established civilisation 
must have brought about. 
These opposing forces can be detected in working

order. What can be more indicative of a dual system 
of belief than the cry of an old Scottish peasant when 
he came to worship at the sacred well?—‘‘O Lord, Thou 
knowest that well would it be for me this day an I had 
stoopit my knees and my heart before Thee in spirit and 
in truth as often as I have stoopit them afore this well. 
But we maun keep the customs of our fathers.” It 
appears over and over again in the lives of early Chris- 
tian saints who were only just parting from a living 
pagan faith. Thus St. Bega was the patroness of 
St. Bees in Cumberland, where she left a holy bracelet 
which was long an object of profound veneration ; and 
in a prefatory statement by the compiler of a small 
collection of her miracles, written in the twelfth 
century, we learn among other things that whosoever 
forswore himself upon her bracelet swiftly incurred 
the heaviest punishment of perjury or a speedy death. 
It is to be observed that Beagas, the French Bague, 
is the Anglo-Saxon denomination for rings, and 
Dr. William Bell suggests that holy St. Bega was but 
a personification of one of the holy rings which, having 
gained great hold upon the minds of the heathen 
Cumbrians, it was not politic in their first Christian 
missionaries wholly to subvert.1 These rings are, of 
course, the doom rings of the Scandinavian temples 
which are so often referred to in the Sagas.® 
Baptism, an essentially Christian ceremony, might 
off-hand be supposed to contain nothing but evidence 
for Christianity. It might at most be expected that the

  324 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
details of the ceremony would contain relics of adapted 
pagan rites, and this we know is the case. But we can 
go beyond even this, and discover in the popular 
conception of the rite very clear indications of the 
early antagonism between Christianity and paganism— 
an antagonism which is certainly some eighteen hundred 
years old in this country, and though so old is still 
contained in the evidence of folklore. 
An analysis of baptismal folklore shows us that 
its most important section is contained under the 
group which deals with the effect of non-baptism. 
In England we have it prevailing in the border 
counties, in Cornwall, Devonshire, Durham, Lanca- 
shire, Middlesex, Northumberland, and Yorkshire, and 
in North-East Scotland, that children joined the ranks 
of the fairies if they died unchristened, or that their 
souls wandered about in the air, restless and unhappy, 
until Judgment Day. Various penalties attended the 
condition of non-baptism, but perhaps the most signifi- 
cant is the Northumberland custom of burying an 
unbaptised babe at the feet of an adult Christian corpse 
—surely a relic of the old sacrifice at a burial which is 
indicated so frequently in the graves of prehistoric 
times, particularly of the long-barrow period. In 
Ireland we have the effect of non-baptism in a still 
more grim form. In the sixteenth century the rude 
Irish used to leave the right arms of their male children 
unchristened, to the intent that they might give a more 
ungracious and deadly blow. 
These, and their allied and variant customs, are 
relics, not so much of the absorption by Christian

baptism of rites belonging to early paganism as of the 
struggle between Christianity and paganism for the 
mastery, of the anathemas of Christians against pagans, 
and of the terrible answer of the pagan. And what are 
we to say to it? Is it that the struggle itself has lasted 
all these centuries, or only its memory? My belief is 
that the struggle itself has lasted in reality though not 
in name. 
But if we have been able to look through the very 
portals of Christianity to the regions of paganism be- 
hind, can we not boldly pass through altogether and 
recover from folklore much of the lost evidence of our 
prehistoric ancestors? I put the question in this way 
purposely, because it is the way which is indicated by 
the methods and data of folklore, and it is a question 
which has much to do with the different views held of 
the province of folklore. 
I will answer by referring to the pre-baptismal rites 
of washing. In Northumberland we meet with the 
analogue of the sixteenth-century Irish practice, for 
there the child’s right hand is left unwashed that it may 
gather riches better'—the golden coin taking the place 
of the ancient weapon in this as in other phases of civi- 
lisation. Not only is the water used for this purpose 
heated in the old-fashioned way by placing red-hot irons 
in it (z.e. the modern equivalent for stone-boiling), but 
in Yorkshire we have the custom that the new-born 
infant must be placed in the arms of a maiden before 
any one else touches it, two practices represented exactly 
in the customs of the Canary Islanders, who were in 
the stone age of culture and are considered to be the last

remnants of a race which once included Britain among 
its lands of occupation. 1 
The Rev. C. O’Connor, in his third letter of Colum- 
banus, gives a very interesting statement of Irish well- 
worship in a letter addressed to his brother, the late 
Owen O’Connor Don, and which shows the living 
antagonism between Christian and pagan belief. He 
says :— 
“J have often enquired of your tenants what they them- 
selves thought of their pilgrimage to their wells of Kill 
Orcht, Tobbar-Brighde, Tobbar-Muire, near Elphin, and 
Moore, near Castlereagh, where multitudes assemble annu- 
ally to celebrate what they, in broken English, termed 
Patterns ; and when I pressed a very old man—Owen Hester 
—to state what possible advantage he expected to derive 
from the singular custom of frequenting in particular such 
wells as were contiguous to an old blasted oak, or an upright 
unhewn stone, and what the meaning was of the yet more 
singular custom of sticking rags in the branches of such 
trees and spitting on them, his answer, and the answer of 
the oldest men, was that their ancestors always did it; 
that it was a preservative against Geasa-Dravideacht, z.e. the 
sorceries of Druids; that their cattle was preserved by it 
from infectious disorders ; that the davini maithe, z.e. the 
fairies, were kept in good humour by it; and so thoroughly 
persuaded were they of the sanctity of these pagan practices 
that they would travel bareheaded and barefooted from ten

Scarcely less important than the effect of the an- 
tagonism of the Church in the production of arrested 
development is the effect of the toleration of the Church 
for pagan custom and belief. This toleration took the 
shape either of allowing the continuation of pagan 
custom and belief as a matter not affecting Christian 
doctrine or of actual absorption into Church practice 
and ritual. The story told to the full is a long and 
interesting one. And it still awaits the telling. 
Gibbon, in a few sentences, has told us the outline.* 
Other authorities have told us small episodes. I am, 
of course, not concerned here with anything more than 
to adduce sufficient evidence to establish the fact that 
Christian tolerance of paganism has been one of the 
assistant causes for the long continuance of pagan sur- 
vivals. 
I shall not hesitate to begin by quoting at length a 
luminous passage from Grimm’s great work. In the 
preface to his second edition he writes as follows :— 
“Oftentimes the Church prudently permitted, or could not 
prevent, that heathen and Christian things should here and 
there run into one another ; the clergy themselves would not 
always succeed in marking off the bounds of the two reli- 
gions: their private leanings might let some things pass which 
they found firmly rooted in the multitude. In the language, 
together with a stock of newly-imported Greek and Latin 
terms, there still remained, even for ecclesiastical use, a 
number of Teutonic words previously employed in heathen 
services, just as the names of gods stood ineradicable in the 
days of the week; to such words old customs would still

cling silent and unnoticed and take a new lease of life. The 
festivals of the people present a tough material: they are so 
closely bound up with its habits of life that they will put up 
with foreign additions if only to save a fragment of festivi- 
ties long loved and tried. In this way Scandinavia, prob- 
ably the Goths also for a time, and the Anglo-Saxons down 
to a late period, retained the heathenish Yule as all Teutonic 
Christians did the sanctity of Easter-tide; and from these 
two the Yule-boar and Yule-bread, the Easter pancake, 
Easter-sword, Easter-fire, and Easter-dance could not be 
separated. As faithfully were perpetuated the name and in 
many cases the observances of Midsummer. New Christian 
feasts, especially of saints, seem purposely, as well as acci- 
dentally, to have been made to fall on heathen holidays. 
Churches often rose precisely where a heathen god or his 
sacred tree had been pulled down, and the people trod their 
old paths to the accustomed site ; sometimes the very walls 
of the heathen temple became those of the church, and cases 
occur in which idol images still found a place in a wall of the 
porch, or were set up outside the door, as at Bamberg 
Cathedral there lie Slavic heathen figures of animals in- 
scribed with runes. Sacred hills and fountains were re- 
christened after saints, to whom their sanctity was trans- 
ferred; sacred woods were handed over to the newly-founded 
convent or the king, and even under private ownership did 
not lose their long-accustomed homage. Law usages, par- 
ticularly the ordeals and oath-takings, but also the beating 
of bounds, consecrations, image processions, spells and for- 
mulas, while retaining their heathen character, were simply 
clothed in Christian forms. In some customs there was 
little to change: the heathen practice of sprinkling a new- 
born babe with water closely resembled Christian baptism ; 
the sign of the hammer, that‘of the cross ; and the erection 
of tree crosses the irmensfls and world trees of paganism.”! 
1Grimm, Teutonic Mythology, by Stallybrass, iii. pp. 35, 36. A 
passage from Hakon’s Saga, quoted by Du Chaillu in his Viking Age, 
i, p. 464, shows that the northern peoples adopted the same measures.

This passage, written in 1844, has been abundantly 
illustrated by the research of specialists since that date, 
and, of course, Mr. Frazer’s monumental work will 
occur to every reader. But, after all, the chief authority 
for the action of the Church towards paganism in this 
country is the famous letter of Pope Gregory to the 
Abbot Mellitus in a.p. 601, as preserved by the his- 
torian Beda. It is worth while quoting this once 
again, for it is an English historical document of 
priceless value. ‘‘We have been much concerned,” 
writes the good St. Gregory, 
“since the departure of our congregation that is with you, 
because we have received no account of the success of your 
journey. When, therefore, Almighty God shall bring you to 
the most reverend Bishop Augustine our brother, tell him 
what I have, upon mature deliberation on the affair of the 
English, determined upon, namely, that the temples of the 
idols [fana idolorum] in that nation [gente] ought not to be 
destroyed ; but let the idols that are in them be destroyed ; let 
holy water be made and sprinkled upon the said temples, let 
altars be erected and relics placed. For if these temples be 
well built, it is requisite that they be converted from the 
worship of devils [daemonum] to the worship of the true God ; 
that the nation seeing that their temples are not destroyed may 
remove error from their hearts, and knowing and adoring the 
true God may the more familiarly resort to the places to which 
they have been accustomed. And because they have been 
used to slaughter many oxen in the sacrifices to devils some 
solemnity must be exchanged for them on this account, so 
that on the day of the dedication, or the nativities of the 
holy martyrs whose relics are there deposited, they may 
build themselves huts of the boughs of trees, about those 
churches which have been turned to that use from temples 
and celebrate the solemnity with religious feasting and no

more offer beasts to the devil [diabolo], but kill cattle to the 
praise of God in their eating, and return thanks to the giver 
of all things for their sustenance.”’! 
The church of St. Pancras at Canterbury is claimed 
to be one of the temples so preserved,’ and there have 
survived down to our own times examples of the 
animal sacrifice which in early Christian days may 
well have been preserved by this famous edict. But 
beyond these illustrations of the two stated objects 
of Pope Gregory’s letter there are innumerable addi- 
tional results from such a policy,‘ results which prove 
that British pagandom was not stamped out by edict 
or by sword, but was rather gradually borne down 
before the strength of the new religion—borne down 
and pushed into the background out of sight of the 
Church and the State, relegated to the cottage homes, 
the cattle-sheds and the cornfields, the countryside and 
the denizens thereof.°

“Even as the good Pope Gregory the Great permitted the newly con-

ing, however, to them another purpose and a new meaning, so his 
successors found means to utilize the simple beliefs of early animism. 
Long and vainly the Church struggled against this irresistible sentiment. 
Fifteen centuries ago it was charged against the Christians of that day 
that they appeased the shades of the dead with feasts like the Gentiles,

This is where we must search for it, and I think this 
important element in our studies will be better under- 
stood if we turn for one moment to the results of 
Christian contact with earlier belief in the one country 
where Christianity has set up its strongest political force, 
namely, Italy. Dr. Middleton wrote a series of re- 
markable letters which tell us much on this point, but 
before referring to this, I wish first to quote a hitherto 
buried record by an impartial observer! in the year 
1704. It isa letter written from Venice to Sir Thomas 
Frankland, describing the travels and observations of 
a journey into Italy. The traveller writes :— 
“T cannot leave Itally without making some general ob- 
servations upon the country in general, and first as to their 
religion ; it differs in name only now from what it was in the 
time of the ancient heathen Romans. I know this will 
sound very oddly with some sort of people, but compare 
them together and then let any reasonable man judge of the 
difference. The heathen Itallians had their gods for peace 
Saxons complaint is made of the too ready canonisation of the dead ; 
and the Church seems to have been much troubled to keep within 
reasonable bounds this tendency to indiscriminate apotheosis. At length 
a compromise was effected; and the Feast of All Souls converted to 
pious uses that wealth of sentiment which previously was lavished on 
the dead” (The Aryan Household, p. 60). And, to close this short note 
upon an important subject, Mr. Metcalfe, speaking of the old poetic 
literature of the pagan English, says: ‘‘It was kidnapped, and its 
features so altered and disguised as not to be recognisable. It was sup- 
planted by Christian poetical legends and Bible lays produced in rivalry 
of the popular lays of their heathen predecessors. Finding that the 
people would listen to nothing but these old lays, the missionaries 
affected their spirit and language, and borrowed the words and phrases 
of heathenism” (Metcalfe’s Englishman and Scandinavian, p. 155). 
1 For some reason not apparent in the document itself, Mrs. S. C. 
Lomas, the editor of this report, says this interesting letter gives ‘“‘a 
curious and evidently prejudiced description of the religious houses and 
observances.” See preface to Hist. MSS. Com. Report on the MSS. of 
Chequers Court, Bucks, p. x.

    332 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
and for war, for plenty and poverty, for health and sickness, 
riches and poverty, to whom they addressed themselves and 
their wants ; and the Christian Itallians have their patron 
saints for each of these things, to whom they also address 
according to their wants. The heathen sacrificed bulls and 
other beasts, and the Christian ones after the same manner 
a piece of bread, which a picture in the garden of Aldo- 
brandina at Rome, painted in the time of Titus Vespasian, 
shews by the altar and the priests’ vestments to have been 
the same as used now. The Pantheon at Rome was dedi- 
cated by the ancients to all the gods, and by the moderns to 
all the saints ; the temple of Castor and Pollux at Rome is 
now dedicated to Cosmo and Damian, also twin brothers. 
The respect they pay to the Virgin Mary is far greater than 
what they pay to the Son, and whatever English Roman 
Catholics may be made to believe by their priests or impose 
upon us, it is certain that the devotion to the Madonnas in 
Itally is something more than a bare representation of the 
Virgin Mary when they desire her intercession. Miracles 
they pretend not only to be wrought by the Madonnas them- 
selves, but there is far greater respect paid to a Madonna in 
one place than another, whereas if this statue were only a 
bare representation of the Virgin to keep them in mind of 
her, the respect would be equal. I visited all the famous 
ones, and it would fill a volume to tell you the fopperies 
that’s said of them. That of Loretto, being what they say 
is the very house where the Virgin lived, is not to be 
described, the riches are so great, nor the devotion that’s 
paid to the statue. . . . The Lady of Saronna is another 
famous one and very rich; she is much handsomer than she 
of Loretto and a whole church-full of the legend of the 
miracles she hath wrought. She is in great reputation, and 
it’s thought will at last outtop the Lady of Loretto; there is 
another near Leghorne that I also visited called Za Madonna 
della Silva Nera, to whom all Itallian ships that enter that 
port make a present of thanks for their happy voyage, and
-P-A-G-E-389
  EUROPEAN CONDITIONS 333 
salute her with their cannon, and most ships going out give 
her something for her protection during their voyage. I 
could tire you with she at the Annunciata at Florence, she 
within a mile of Bollognia, for whom the magistracy have 
piazza’d the road all the way from her station to the city, 
that she may not be encumbered with sun or rain when she 
makes them a visit, and hundreds more that would fill a 
volume of fopperies that I had the curiosity to see, but it 
would be imposing too much upon your patience.” ! 
This only confirms Dr. Middleton’s conclusions, 
which received the approval of Gibbon, and those of 
later writers. ‘‘ As I descended from the Alps,” writes 
the Rev. W. H. Blunt in 1823, 
“I was admonished of my entrance into Italy by a little 
chapel to the Madonna, built upon a rock by the road- 
side, and from that time till I repassed this chain of 
mountains I received almost hourly proof that I was wander- 
ing amongst the descendants of that people which is 
described by Cicero to have been the most religious of man- 
kind. Though the mixture of religion with all the common 
events of life is anything but an error, yet I could not avoid 
regretting that, like their heathen ancestors, the modern 
Italians had supplied the place of our great master mover by 
a countless host of inferior agents.”? 
Mr. Blunt goes on to give interesting details of the 
close connection between the modern religious festival, 
ceremony, or service, and those of classical times, and 
the conclusion is obvious. In modern days Dr. 
Mommsen has lent the sanction of his great authority 
to the identification of the birthday of Christ with 
1 Hist, MSS, Com., Chequers Court Papers, pp. 171-2.

that of Mithra,' and Mr. Leland has given such 
numerous identifications not only of the cults of pagan 
and Christian Italy, but of the god-names of ancient 
Rome with the saint-names or witch-names of modern 
times,” that it seems impossible to deny a place for this 
evidence. ‘‘It was,” says Gibbon, 
“‘the universal sentiment both of the Church and of heretics 
that the daemons were the authors, the patrons, and the objects 
of idolatry ; those rebellious spirits who had been degraded 
from the rank of angels were still permitted to roam upon 
earth, to torment the bodies and to seduce the minds of sinful 
men. It was confessed, or at least it was imagined, that they 
had distributed among themselves the most important charac- 
ters of Polytheism, one damon assuming the name of Jupiter, 
another of AXsculapius, a third of Venus, and a fourth 
perhaps of Apollo.’”’® 
This, then, is recognition and adoption of pagan be- 
liefs, not the uprooting of them. If the Roman Jupiter 
was a Christian demon, his existence at all events was 
recognised. But even this negative way of adopting the 
old beliefs gave way as the Church spread further. The 
tribe of demons soon included the popular fairy, elf, 
and goblin. And then came the positive adoption of 
pagan customs. Gibbon describes how the early 
Christians refused to decorate their doors with garlands 
and lamps, and to take part in the ceremonial of lifting 
the bride over the threshold of the house.‘ Both 
these customs have survived in popular folklore, in 
1 Corpus inse. Lat., i. 409; and cf. Cumont’s Mysteries of Mithra 
(1903).

  EUROPEAN CONDITIONS 335 
spite of the recorded action of the early Church, and 
it would be curious to ascertain whether they have 
survived by the help of the Church. We cannot 
answer that question of historical evidence just now, 
but it is a question which, in its wider aspect, as 
including many other items of folklore, ought to be 
examined into. There is no doubt, however, that by 
analogy it can be answered, because we have ample 
evidence, if the writings of reformers may be taken as 
historical facts and not polemical imaginations, that 
many very important customs, among the richest as 
well as the poorest treasures of folklore, have been, so 
to speak, Christianised by the Church, and that 
the Church has taken part in and adopted non- 
Christian customs, the survivors of olden-time life 
in Europe.! 
Now it is clear from these considerations, and from 
the vast mass of information which is gradually being 
accumulated on the subject, that not only the arresting 
force of Christianity but also its toleration has assisted 
in the preservation of pre-Christian belief and custom. 
But the preservation has been in fragments only. The 
system which suppofted the older faith and might, if it 
had been allowed a natural growth, have produced 
a newer religion of its own, was completely shattered. 
1 Evidence is scattered far and wide in most of the reliable studies in 
folklore. Two special books may be mentioned. A great storehouse of 
examples is to be found in The Popish Kingdome, by Thomas Nao- 
georgus, Englyshed by Barnabe Googe, 1570, a new edition of which 
was published by Mr. R. C. Hope in 1880; and Mr. H. M, Bower has ex- 
haustively examined one important Italian ceremony in his The Elevation 
and Procession of the Ceri at Gubbio, published by the Folklore Society 
in 1897. 
 
-P-A-G-E-392

It left no preservative force except that of tradition, the 
traditional instinct to do what has always been done, to 
believe what has always been believed. Pre-Christian 
belief and custom has thus become isolated beliefs and 
customs in survival. It has been broken up into in- 
numerable fragments of unequal character, and con- 
taining unequal elements. It has been forced back 
into secret action wherever Christianity was wholly 
antagonistic, and hence primitive public worship has 
tended to become local worship, or household worship, 
or even personal worship, while all such worship which 
is not the authorised Church worship has tended to be- 
come superstition. Where Christianity was not wholly 
antagonistic, it absorbed rites, customs, and even be- 
liefs, and these primitive survivals have taken their 
place in the evolution of Christian doctrine, and thus 
become lost to the students of Celtic and Teutonic 
antiquities. But even so, there are discoverable points 
where the dividing line between non-Christian and 
Christian belief has not been obliterated by the process 
of absorption. In all cases it is the duty of the student 
to note the stage of arrested development in the primi- 
tive rite, custom, or belief, whether it be caused by 
antagonism or by absorption. It is at this point, 
indeed, that the history of the survival begins. It 
is here that we have to turn from the polity, the 
religion, or cultus of a people to the belief, practices, 
or superstition of that portion of our nation which 
has not shared its progress from tribesmen to citizens, 
from paganism to Christianity, from vain imaginings 
to science and philosophy. It is from this point we 
have to turn from the dignity of courts, the doings
-P-A-G-E-393
  EUROPEAN CONDITIONS 337 
of armies, and the results of commerce, to the doings, 
sayings, and ideas of the peasantry who cannot read, 
and who have depended upon tradition for all, or 
almost all, they know outside the formalities of law 
and Church.

  CHAPTER VII 
ETHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
LREADY I have had to point out that an 
appeal to ethnological evidence is the means 
of avoiding the wholesale rejection of custom 
and belief recorded of early Britain, because it has 
been rejected as appertaining to the historic Celt. I 
will now proceed with the definite proposition that the 
survivals in folklore may be allocated and explained by 
their ethnological bearing. 
Some years ago I advanced this proposition in my 
little book entitled Ethnology in Folklore. Only halt- 
ingly have my conclusions been accepted, but I no- 
where find them disproved,! while here and there I find 
good authorities appealing to the ethnological element 
in folklore to help them in their views. Mr. MacCulloch, 
for instance, prefers to go for the basis of the Osiris 
and Dionysius myths to an earlier custom than that 
favoured by Mr. Frazer and Mr. Grant Allen, namely, 
to the practices of the neolithic folk, in Egypt and over 
a wide tract of country which includes Britain, of dis- 
1 Mr. Nutt’s presidential address to the Folklore Society in 1899 
does not, I think, disprove my theory. It ignores it, and confines the 
problem to legend and folk-tale. Mr, Nutt’s powerful, but not conclusive, 
study is to be found in Folklore, x. 71-86, and my reply and correspondence 
resulting therefrom are to be found at pp. 129-149. 
338
-P-A-G-E-395
  ETHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 339 
membering the dead body previous to its burial. Mr. 
Lang, Mr. Frazer, Mr. Hartland, and others are 
strangely reticent on this subject. That Mr. Lang 
should be content to trace a story from the Vedas, in 
which Urvasi tells Pururavas that he must never let 
her see him naked, to ‘‘a traditional Aryan law of 
nuptial etiquette,’? seems to be using the heaviest 
machinery for the smallest purposes, while for other 
and greater purposes he fails to find in ethnological 
distinctions, explanations which escape his research.® 
That Mr. Frazer should have been able to examine in so 
remarkable a manner the agricultural rites of European 
peoples, and only to have touched upon their ethno- 
logical bearings in one or two isolated cases, seems to 
me to be neglecting one of the obvious means of 
arriving at the solution of the problem he starts out 
to solve.* 
I do not want to discount these fragmentary appeals 
to the ethnological element in folklore. I accept them 
as evidence that the appeal has to be made. I would 
only urge that it may be done on more thorough lines, 
after due consideration of all the elements of the pro- 
position and of all that it means to the study of folk- 
lore. We cannot surrender to the palzontologist all 
that folklore contains in tradition and in custom as to 
pygmy peoples, or to the Egyptologist all that it con- 
tains as to dismemberment burial rites, without at the

-P-A-G-E-396

same time realising that if it is correct to refer these 
two groups of folklore respectively to the earliest ages 
of man’s existence as man and to the neolithic stage of 
culture, they must be withdrawn from all other classifi- 
cation. We cannot use the same items of folklore in 
two totally different ways. The results of withdrawal 
are as important as the results of allocation, and the 
necessity for the correct docketing of all groups of folk- 
lore is thus at once illustrated. 
The first point in the argument for ethnological data 
being discoverable in folklore is that a survey of the 
survivals of custom, belief, and rites in any given 
country shows one marked feature, which results in a 
dividing line being drawn as between two distinct 
classes. This feature is the antagonism which is dis- 
coverable in these classes. On one side of the divid- 
ing line is a set of customs, beliefs, and rites which 
may be grouped together because they are consistent 
with each other, and on the other side is another set 
of customs, beliefs, and rites which may be grouped 
together on the same ground. But between these 
two sets of survivals there is no agreement. They 
are the negations of each other. They show abso- 
lutely different conceptions of all the phases of life 
and thought which they represent, and it is impossible 
to consider that they have both come from the same 
culture source. I have applied the test of ethnology 
to such cases in Britain, and this appears to answer the 
difficulty which their antagonism presents. It appears 
too to be the only answer. 
The subjects which show this antagonism are all of 
vital importance. They include friendly and inimical
-P-A-G-E-397
    ETHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 341 
relations with the dead; marriage as a sacred tribal 
rite and marriage as a rule of polyandrous society ; 
birth ceremonies which tell of admittance into a sacred 
circle of kinsmen, and birth ceremonies which breathe 
of revenge and hostility; the reverential treatment of 
the aged folk and the killing of them off; the preser- 
vation of human life as part of the tribal blood, and 
human sacrifice as a certain cure for all personal evils ; 
the worship of waters as a strongly localised cult, pre- 
served because it is local by whatsoever race or people 
are in occupation and in successive occupation of the 
locality ; totemic beliefs connected with animals and 
plants contrasted with ideas entirely unconnected with 
totemism—all this, and much more which has yet to be 
collected and classified, reveals two distinct streams of 
thought which cannot by any process be taken back to 
one original source. 
This fact of definite antagonism between different 
sets of surviving beliefs existing together in one 
country leads to several very important conclusions. 
This is the case with the Irish Sids. These beings 
are said to be scattered over Ireland, and around 
them assembled for worship the family or clan of the 
deified patron. While there were thus a number of 
topical deities, each in a particular spot where he was 
to be invoked, the deities themselves with the rest of 
their non-deified but blessed brother spirits had as 
their special abode ‘‘ Lands of the Living,” the happy 
island or islands somewhere far away in the ocean. 
Now this Sid worship, we are told by Irish scholars, 
“had nothing to do with Druidism—in fact, was quite 
opposed to it,” the Sids and the Druids being ‘fre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-398
342 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
quently found at variance with each other in respect to 
mortals.” + 
This is the commencing point of the evidence which 
proves Druidism to have belonged to the pre-Celtic 
people, though finding an adopted home among them. 
This is so important a subject and has been so strangely 
and inconsistently dealt with by most authorities that it 
will be well to indicate where we have to search for the 
non-Celtic, and therefore pre-Celtic, origin of Druidism. 
The Druidism revealed by classical authorities is, for 
the most part, the Druidism of continental peoples and 
not of Britain, and I hesitate to accept off-hand that it 
is proper to transfer the continental system to Britain 
and say that the two systems were one and the same. 
There is certainly no evidence from the British side 
which would justify such a course, and I think there is 
sufficient argument against it to suspend judgment 
until the whole subject is before us. If Professor 
Rhys is right in concluding that Druidism is at its 
roots a non-Celtic religion,? we must add to this that 
it was undoubtedly a non-Teutonic religion. Celts 
and Teutons were sufficiently near in all the elements 
of their civilisation for this want of parallel in their 
relationship to Druidism to be an additional argument 
against the Celts having originated this cult. And 
then the explanation of the differences between conti- 
nental and British Druidism becomes comparatively 
easy to understand. The continental Celts, mixing

  ETHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 343 
more thoroughly with the pre-Celtic aborigines than 
did the British Celts, would have absorbed more of the 
pre-Celtic religion than the British Celts, and hence all 
the details which classical authorities have left us of con- 
tinental Druidism appear as part of the Celtic religion, 
while in Britain these details are for the most part absent. 
But this is not all. There are certain rites in Britain 
noted by the early authorities which are not attached to 
any particular cult. They are not Druidic; they are 
not Celtic. They are, as a matter of fact, special ex- 
amples of rites practised in only one locality, and 
accordingly referred to as something extraordinary and 
not general. From this it is clearly correct to argue 
that the British Celts had in their midst a cult which, 
if they did not destroy, they certainly did not absorb, 
and that therefore this cult being non-Celtic must have 
been pre-Celtic. 
I do not wish to argue this point out further than is 
necessary to explain the position which, it appears to 
me, Druidism occupies, and I will therefore only add 
a note as to the authorities for the statements I have 
advanced. The differences between continental and 
British Druidism are definite and pronounced,! the 
1 The continental evidence has been collected together in convenient 
shape by modern scholars: thus Mr. Stock, in his work on Cesar 
de bello Gailico, notes and compares the evidence of Czsar, Strabo, 
Diodorus Siculus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Mela, Lucan, and Pliny as 
it has been interpreted by modern scholars (see pp. 107-113), and he 
is followed by Mr. T. Rice Holmes in his study of Caesar's Conquest 
of Gaul, pp. 532-536. The Druidic cult of belief in immortality, 
metempsychosis, ritual of the grove, augury, human sacrifice, is all 
set out and discussed, These are the continental Druidic beliefs 
and practices, and they may be compared with the Druidic Irish 
beliefs and practices in Eugene O’Curry’s Manners and Customs 
of the Ancient Irish, lect. ix, and x, vol. ii. pp. 179-228, and Dr. Joyce’s

mixture of the continental Celts with the Iberic people, 
which they displaced, is attested, by ancient authority 
and modern anthropology,! while the only evidence of 
such a mixture in Britain is the prominently recorded 
instance of the Picts intermarrying with the Gael,? and 
this has to be set against the close distinction between 
tribesmen and non-tribesmen, which is such a remark- 
able feature of Celtic law;* the existence of local 
cults in early Britain having all the characteristics of 
a ruder and more savage origin, and not identified 
with Celticism, is a point derived from our early 
authorities.t These are the main facts of the case, 
Social History of Ancient Ireland, i. 219-248, where ‘‘the points of 
agreement and difference between Irish and Gaulish Druids” are 
discussed. Mr. Elton notices the difference between the continental 
and the British Druids, but ascribes it to unequal development (Origins 
of Eng. Hist., 267-268). Czesar’s well-known account of the wicker- 
work sacrifice is very circumstantial. It is not repeated by either 
Diodorus or Strabo, who both refer to individual human sacrifice. 
Pliny introduces the mistletoe, oak, and serpent cults, and the other 
three authorities are apparently dependent upon their precedessors. 
1 The mixture of Celt and Iberian is very ably dealt with by Mr. 
Holmes in his Cesar’s Conquest of Gaul, pp. 245-322, and by Ripley, 
Races of Europe, 461, 467, together with cap. vii. and xii.; see also 
Sergi, Mediterranean Race, cap. xii. 
2 The intermarrying of the Picts with the Celts of the district they 
conquered is mentioned in all the chronicles as an important and 
significant rite, which determined the succession to the Pictish throne 
through the female side (Skene’s Chron. of the Picts and Scots, 40, 45, 
126, 319, 328, 329). Beda, i. cap. i., mentions female succession. Skene 
discusses this point in Celtic Scotland, i. 232-235, and McLennan includes 
it in his evidence from anthropological data (Studies in Anc. Hist., 99). 
% Mr. Seebohm is the best authority for the importance of the non- 
tribesman in Celtic law (Zribal System in Wales, 54-60). 
4 The local cults in Great Britain which are not Celtic in form, and do 
not seem to be connected with Celtic religion on any analogy, are those 
relating to Cromm Cruaich, referred to in the Tripartite Life of St. 
Patrick (see Whitley Stokes in Revue Celtique, i. 260, xvi. 35-36;

and the subject has to be worked out in considerable 
detail before it can be settled. 
There is one other primary subject which bears upon 
the question of race distinctions in folklore. With the 
fact of conquest to reckon with, the relationship of the 
conqueror to the conquered is a matter toconsider. In 
the European tribal system it was a definite relation- 
ship, so definite that the conquered, as we have seen, 
formed an essential part of the tribal organisation—the 
kinless slaves beneath the tribal kindred. There wasa 
place for the kinless in the tribal economy and in the 
tribal laws. There was also a place for them in the 
tribal system of belief, and the mythic influence of the 
conquered is a subject that needs very careful con- 
sideration. 
It is an influence which appears in all parts of the 
world. Thus, to give a few instances, in New Guinea 
they have no idols, and apparently no idea of a 
supreme being or a good spirit. Their only religious 
ideas consist in a belief in evil spirits. They live a 
life of slavish fear to these, but seem to have no 
idea of propitiating them by sacrifice or prayer. They 
believe in the deathlessness of the soul. A death in 
201). I do not follow Rhys in his identification of this cult as a part 
of the ceremonies on mounds, and suggest that Mr. Bury in his Life of 
St. Patrick, 123-125, gives the clue to the purely local character of this 
idol worship which I claim for it. Similarly the overthrow of the 
temple at Goodmanham, Godmundingham, described by Beda, ii, 
cap. 13, with its priest who was not allowed to carry arms, or to ride on 
any but a mare, is the destruction of a successful local cult, not of 
a national or tribal religion. I confess that Dr. Greenwell’s observations 
in connection with his barrow discoveries (British Barrows, 286-331) are 
in favour of an early Anglican cultus, but I think his facts may be 
otherwise interpreted, and in any case they confirm my view of the 
special localisation of this cult.

the village is the occasion of bringing plenty of ghosts 
to escort their new companion, and perhaps fetch some 
one else. All night the friends of the deceased sit up 
and keep the drums going to drive away the spirits ; 
they strike the fences and posts of houses all through 
the village with sticks. This is done to drive back the 
spirits to their own quarters on the adjacent mountain 
tops. But it is the spirits of the inland tribes, the 
aborigines of the country, that the coast tribes most 
fear. They believe, when the natives are in the neigh- 
bourhood, that the whole plain is full of spirits who 
come with them. All calamities are attributed to the 
power and malice of these evil spirits. Drought, 
famine, storm and flood, disease and death are all 
supposed to be brought by Vata and his hosts, so that 
the people are an easy prey to any designing individuals 
who claim power over these. Some disease charmers

It appears that the native population of New Zealand 
was originally composed of two different races, which 
have retained some of their characteristic features, 
although in course of time they have in all other 
respects become mixed, and a number of intermediate 
varieties have thence resulted. From the existence of 
two races in New Zealand the conclusion might be 
drawn that the darker were the original proprietors of 
the soil anterior to the arrival of a stock of true Poly- 
nesian origin, that they were conquered by the latter 
and nearly exterminated. There is a district in the

northern island, situated between Taupo and Hawke’s 
Bay, called Urewera, consisting of steep and barren 
hills. The scattered inhabitants of this region have 
the renown of being the greatest witches in the country. 
They are very much feared, and have little connection 
with the neighbouring tribes, who avoid them if 
possible. If they come to the coast the natives there 
scarcely venture to refuse them anything for fear of 
incurring their displeasure. They are said to use the 
saliva of the people whom they intend to bewitch, and 
visitors carefully conceal their spittle to give them no 
opportunity of working their evil. Like our witches 
and sorcerers of old, they appear to be a very harm- 
less people, and but little mixed up with the quarrels of 
their neighbours.! The Australians, according to 
Oldfield, ascribe spirit powers to those residing north 
of themselves and hold them in great dread.? 
In Asia the same idea prevails among the native 
races. Thus Colquhoun says, 
‘‘it was amusing to find the dread in which the Lawas [a 
hill tribe] are held by both Burmese and Siamese. This is 
due to a fear of being bitten by them and dying of the bite. 
They are called by their Burmese neighbours the ‘man- 
_bears.’ A singular custom obtains amongst these people 
which may perhaps partly account for this superstition. On 
a certain night in the year the youths and maidens meet 
together for the purpose of pairing. Unacceptable youths 
are said to be bitten severely if they make advances to the 
ladies.”®

querors for the conquered is proved from other sources

In Africa it appears as a living force, and we are told 
that the stories current in the country of the Ukerewé,

  350 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
These facts are sufficient to show that the mythic in- 
fluence of a conquered race is a factor which may assist 
in the discussion of the ethnological conditions of folk- 
lore, and it is obvious that they reveal a very powerful 
influence for the continuance of ancient ideas as well 
as for the creation of fresh examples of ancient ideas 
applied to new experiences. It is well in this connec- 
tion to remember certain historical facts connected with 
the settlement of the English in Britain. 
From Freeman’s Old English History it appears that 
at the beginning of the seventh century ‘‘the tract of 
country which the English then ruled over south of the 
Humber, coincided almost exactly with the boundary of 
the Gaulish portion of Britain,” as distinct from non- 
Aryan Britain. This apparent recognition of Celtic 
landmarks, says Professor Rhys, by the later invaders, 
‘is a fact, the historical and political significance of 
which I leave to be weighed by others,”! and I venture 
to suggest that one important result is to show Britain 
to have contained an Aryan culture-ground and a 
non-Aryan culture-ground. If we try to step from 
one to the other we quickly discover the mythic re- 
lationship of conqueror to the conquered. 
Thus in the Anglo-Saxon life of St. Guthlac we have 
an interesting glimpse into the conditions of the country 
and the attitude of the two hostile races, Celts and 
Teutons, to each other. 
‘‘There is in Britain a fen of immense size which begins 
from the river Granta, not far from the city, which is named 
Grantchester . . . a man named Tatwine said that he knew 
an island especially obscure, which ofttimes many men had

attempted to inhabit, but no man could do it on account of 
manifold horrors and fears, and the loneliness of the wild 
wilderness. . . . No man ever could inhabit it before the 
holy man Guthlac came thither on account of the dwelling 
of the accursed spirits there . . . There was on the island a 
great mound raised upon the earth, which same of yore men 
had dug and broken up in hopes of treasure. . . . Then in 
the stillness of the night it happened suddenly that there 
came great hosts of the accursed spirits, and they filled the 
house with their coming, and they poured in on every side 
from above and beneath and everywhere. They were in 
countenance horrible, and they had great heads and a long 
neck and lean visage; they were filthy and squalid in their 
beards, and they had rough ears and distorted face, and 
fierce eyes and foul mouths: and their teeth were like horses’ 
tusks, and their throats were filled with flame, and they were 
grating in their voice: they had crooked shanks and knees, 
big and great behind, and distorted toes, and shrieked 
hoarsely with their voices, and they came with such im- 
moderate noises and immense horror that it seemed to him 
that all between heaven and earth resounded with their 
dreadful cries. Without delay, when they were come into 
the house, they soon bound the holy man in all his limbs, and 
they pulled and led him out of the cottage and brought him 
to the black fen and threw and sunk him in the muddy 
waters. After that they brought him to the wild places of 
the wilderness, among the dense thickets of brambles that 
all his body was torn. After they had a long time thus 
tormented him in darkness they let him abide and stand 
awhile, then commanded him to depart from the wilderness, 
or if he would not do so they would torment and try him with 
greater plagues.”! 
These doings are not sufficiently remote from sober 
fact for us to be unable to detect human enemies in the 
1 Life of St. Guthlac, by Felix of Crowland, edit. C. W. Goodwin,

supposed beings of the spirit world, and this conclusion 
is confirmed by a later passage in the same narrative 
describing Guthlac awakened from his sleep and hearing 
‘*a great host of the accursed spirits speaking in British 
[bryttisc] and he knew and understood their words 
because he had been erewhile in exile among them.” 
Guthlac in England is only experiencing what other 
saints experienced elsewhere,? and we cannot doubt we 
have in these reminiscences of saintly experience that 
mixture of fact with traditional belief which would 
follow the priests of the new religions from their 
native homes to the cell. 
It is necessary to consider another great element in 
human life with reference to its ethnological value, for 
folklore has always been intimately associated with it, 
and recently, owing to Mr. Frazer’s brilliant re- 
searches, this branch of folklore has been almost 
unduly accentuated. I mean, of course, agriculture. 
Mr. Frazer has ignored the ethnological side of agri- 
culture, and it has been appropriated by the student of 
economics as a purely historical institution. This has 
caused a special position to be given to agricultural 
rites and customs almost without question and certainly 
without examination, and it will be necessary to go 
rather closely into the subject in order to clear up the 
difficulties which present neglect has produced. I shall 
once again draw my illustrations from the British Isles. 
I put my facts in this way: (1) In all parts of Great 
Britain there exist rites, customs, and usages con- 
nected with agriculture which are obviously and ad-

mittedly not of legislative or political origin, and which 
present details exactly similar to each other in char- 
acter, but differing from each other in status; (2) that 
the difference in status is to be accounted for by the 
effects of successive conquests; (3) that the identity 
in character is not to be accounted for by reference to 
manorial history, because the area of manorial insti- 
tutions is not coincident with the area of these rites, 
customs, and usages; (4) that exact parallels to them 
exist in India as integral portions of village institu- 
tions; (5) that the Indian parallels carry the subject 
a step further than the European examples because 
they are stamped with the mark of difference in race- 
origin, one portion belonging to the Aryan people and 
the other to the non-Aryan. 
I shall now pick out some examples, and explain 
from them the evidence which seems to me to prove 
that race-distinction is the key for the origin of these 
agricultural rites and usages in Europe as in India. 
I have dealt with these examples at some length in 
my book on the village community, and I shall 
only use such details as I require for my immediate 
purpose. 
My first point is that to get at the survivals of the 
village community in Britain it is not necessary to 
approach it through the medium of manorial history. 
Extremely ancient as I am inclined to think manorial 
history is, it is unquestionably loaded with an artificial 
terminology and with the chains so deftly forged by 
lawyers. An analysis of the chief features in the types 
of the English village community shows that the 
manorial element is by no means acommon factor in 
2A 
 
-P-A-G-E-414
  354 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
the series. These types mark the transition from the 
tribal form to the village form. In Harris Island we 
have the chief with his free tribesmen around him, con- 
nected by blood kinship, living in scattered home- 
steads, just like the German tribes described by 
Tacitus. Under this tribal community is the embryo 
of the village community, consisting of smaller tenantry 
and cottar serfs, who live together in minute villages, 
holding their land in common and yearly distributing 
the holdings by lot. In this type the tribal constitution 
is the real factor, and the village constitution the sub- 
ordinated factor as yet wholly undeveloped, scarcely 
indeed discernible except by very close scrutiny. 
At Kilmorie the tribal community is represented 
merely by the scattered homesteads. These are occu- 
pied by a joint farm-tenantry, who hold their lands 
upon the system of the village community. Here the 
village constitution has gradually entered into, so to 
speak, the tribal constitution, and has almost ab- 
sorbed it. 
At Heisgier and Lauder the tribal community is re- 
presented by the last link under the process of dissolu- 
tion, namely, the free council of the community by 
which the village rights are governed, while the village 
community has developed to a considerable extent. 
At Aston and at Malmesbury the old tribal consti- 
tution is still kept alive in a remarkable manner, and I 
will venture to quote from my book the account of the 
evolution at Aston of a tenantry from the older tribal 
constitution, because in this case we are actually dealing 
with a manor, and the evidence is unique so far as 
England is concerned.
-P-A-G-E-415
ETHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 355 
The first point is that the village organisation, the 
rights of assembly, the free open-air meetings, and the 
corporate action incident to the manor of Aston and 
Cote, attach themselves to the land divisions of sixteen 
hides, because although these hides had grown in 1657 
into a considerable tenancy, fortunately as a tenancy 
they kept their original unity in full force and so ob- 
stinately clung to their old system of government as to 
keep up by representation the once undivided holding of 
the hide. Ifthe organisation of the hide had itself dis- 
appeared, it still formed the basis of the village govern- 
ment, the sixteen hides sending up their sixteen elected 
representatives. How the tenancy grew out of the origi- 
nal sixteen homesteads may perhaps be conjecturally set 
forth. In the first place the owners of the yard-lands suc- 
ceeded to the place originally occupied by the owners of 
the sixteen hides. Instead of the original sixteen group- 
owners we have therefore sixty-four individual owners, 
each yard-land having remained in possession of an 
owner. And then at succeeding stages of this dissolu- 
tion we find the yard-lands broken up until, in 1848, 
“some farmers of Aston have only half or even a 
quarter of a yard-land, while some have as many as 
ten or eleven yard-lands in their single occupation.” 
Then disintegration proceeded to the other proprietary 
tights, which, originally appendant to the homestead 
only, became appendant to the person and not to the 
residence, and are consequently ‘‘ bought and sold as 
separate property, by which means it results that per- 
sons resident at Bampton, or even at great distance, 
have rights on Aston and Cote Common.” And finally 
we lose all trace of the system, as described by Mr. 
 
-P-A-G-E-416
    356 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
Horde and as depicted by the representative character 
of the Sixteens, and in its place find that ‘‘there are 
some tenants who have rights in the common field and 
not in the pasture, and vice versd several occupiers 
have the right of pasture who do not possess any por- 
tion of arable land in the common field,” so that both 
yard-lands and hides have now disappeared, and abso- 
lute ownership of land has taken their place. Mr. 
Horde’s MS. enables us to proceed back from modern 
tenancy-holding to the holding by yard-lands; the 
rights of election in the yard-lands enable us to 
proceed back to the original holding of the sixteen 
hides. 
At Hitchin, which is Mr. Seebohm’s famous example, 
we meet with the manorial type. But its features are 
in no way peculiar. There is nothing which has not 
its counterpart, in more or less well-defined degree, in 
the other types which are not manorial. In short, the 
manorial framework within which it is enclosed does 
little more than fix the details into an immovable set- 
ting, accentuating some at the expense of others, 
legalising everything so as to bring it all under the 
iron sovereignty which was inaugurated by the Ange- 
vin kings. 
My suggestion is that these examples are but varying 
types of one original. The Teutonic people, and their 
Celtic predecessors, came to Britain with a tribal, notan 
agricultural, constitution. In the outlying parts of the 
land this tribal constitution settled down, and was only 
slightly affected by the economical conditions of the 
people they found there; in the more thickly populated 
parts this tribal constitution was superimposed upon
-P-A-G-E-417
ETHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 357 
an already existing village constitution in full vigour. 
We, therefore, find the tribal constitution everywhere 
—in almost perfect condition in the north, in Wales, 
and in Ireland; in less perfect condition in England. 
We also find the village constitution everywhere—in 
almost embryo form in the north, Wales, and in Ireland; 
in full vigour and force in England, especially in that 
area which, as already noted, has been identified as the 
constant occupation-ground of all the races who have 
settled in Britain. 
Now the factor which is most apparent in all these 
cases is the singular dual constitution which I have 
called tribal and village. It is only when we get to such 
cases as Rothwell and Hitchin that almost all traces of 
the tribal element are lost, the village element only 
remaining. But inasmuch as this village element is 
identical in Amd, if not in degree, with the village 
element in the other types, and inasmuch as topograph- 
ically they are closely connected, we are, I contend, 
justified in concluding that it is derived from the same 
original—an original which was composed of a tribal 
community with a village community in serfdom 
under it. 
This dual element should, I think, be translated into 
terms of ethnology by appealing to the parallel evidence 
of India. There the types of the village community 
are not, as was thought by Sir Henry Maine and others, 
homogeneous. There the dual element appears, the 
tribal community at the top of the system, the village 
community at the bottom of the system. But in India 
a new factor is introduced by the equation of the two 
elements with two different races—the tribal element  
-P-A-G-E-418
  358 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
being Aryan, and the village element non-Aryan. Race- 
origins are there still kept up and rigidly adhered to. 
They have not been crushed out, as in Europe, by 
political or economical activity. 
But if crushed out of prominent recognition in 
Europe, are we, therefore, to conclude that their relics 
do not exist in peasant custom? My argument is that 
we cannot have such close parallels in India and in 
England without seeing that they virtually tell the same 
story in both countries. It would require a great 
deal to prove that customs, which in India belong 
now to non-Aryan aborigines and are rejected by the 
Aryans, are in Europe the heritage of the Aryan 
race. 
The objections to my theory have been formulated by 
Mr. Ashley, who follows Mr. Seebohm and M. Fustel 
de Coulanges as an adherent of the chronological 
method of studying institutions. Like the old school 
of antiquaries, this new school of investigators into the 
history of institutions gets back to the period of Roman 
history, and there stops. Mr. Ashley suggests that be- 
cause Cesar describes the Celtic Britons as pastoral, 
therefore agriculture in Britain must be post-Celtic. I 
will not stop to raise the question as to who were the 
tribes from which Cesar obtained his,evidence. But it 
will suffice to point out that if Czsar is speaking of the 
Aryan Celts of Britain—and this much seems certain— 
he only proves of them what Tacitus proves of the 
Aryan Teutons, what the sagas prove of the Aryan 
Scandinavians, what the vedas prove of the Aryan 
Indians, what philology, in short, proves of the primi- 
tive Aryans generally, namely, that they were distinctly
-P-A-G-E-419
      ETHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 359 
hunters and warriors, and hated and despised the tillers 
of the soil. 
It does not, in point of fact, then, help the question 
as to the origin of agricultural rites and usages to turn 
to Aryan history at all. In this emergency Roman 
history is appealed to. But this is just one of those 
cases where a small portion of the facts are squeezed in 
to do duty for the whole. 
Both M. Fustel de Coulanges and Mr. Seebohm think 
that if a Roman origin can be prima facie shown for the 
economical side of agricultural institutions, there is 
nothing more to be said. But they leave out of con- 
sideration a whole set of connected institutions. Readers 
of Mr. Frazer’s Golden Bough are now in possession of 
facts which it would take a very long time to explain. 
They see that side by side with agricultural economics 
is agricultural religion, of great rudenessand barbarity, . 
of considerable complexity, and bearing the stamp of 
immense antiquity. The same villagers who were the 
observers of those rules of economics which are thought 
to be due to Roman origin were also observers of ritual 
and usages which are known to be savage in theory and 
practice. Must we, then, say that all this ritual and 
usage are Roman? or must we go on ignoring them as 
elements in the argument as to the origin of agri- 
cultural institutions? One or the other of these alter- 
natives must, I contend, be accepted by the inquirer. 
Because the State has chosen or been compelled for 
political reasons to lift up peasant economics into man- 
orial legal rules, thus forcibly divorcing this portion of 
peasant life from its natural associations, there is no 
reason why students should fix upon this arbitrary pro-  
-P-A-G-E-420
  360 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
ceeding as the point at which to begin their examination 
into the origin of village agriculture. Manorial tenants 
pay their dues to the lord, lot out their lands in inter- 
mixed strips, cultivate in common, and perform generally 
all those interesting functions of village life with which 
Mr. Seebohm has made us familiar. But, in close 
and intimate connection with these selfsame agricul- 
tural economical proceedings, it is the same body of 
manorial tenants who perform irrational and rude cus- 
toms, who carry the last sheaf of corn represented in 
human or animal form, who sacrifice animals to their 
earth deities, who carry fire round fields and crops, 
who, in a scarcely disguised ritual, still worship deities 
which there is little difficulty in recognising as the 
counterparts of those religious goddesses of India who 
are worshipped and venerated by non-Aryan votaries. 
Christianity has not followed the lead of politics, and 
lifted all this portion of peasant agricultural life into 
something that is religious and definite. And because 
it remains sanctioned by tradition, we must, in con- 
sidering origins, take it into account in conjunction 
with those economic practices which have been unduly 
emphasised in the history of village institutions. In 
India primitive economics and religion go hand in 
hand as part of the village life of the people; in Eng- 
land primitive economics and survivals of old religions, 
which we call folklore, go hand in hand as part of the 
village life of the people. And it is not in the province 
of students to separate one from the other when they 
are considering the question of origin. 
This is practically the whole of my argument from 
the folklore point of view. But it is not the whole of
-P-A-G-E-421
  ETHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 361 
the argument against the theory of the Roman origin 
of the village community. I cannot on this occasion 
re-state what this argument is, as it is set forth at some 
length in my book. But I should like to point out that 
it is in reality supported by arguments to be drawn 
from ethnological facts. Mr. Ashley surrenders to my 
view of the question the important point that ethno- 
logical data, derived from craniological investigation, 
fit in ‘‘ very readily with the supposition that under the 
Celtic, and therefore under the Roman rule, the culti- 
vating class was largely composed of the pre-Celtic 
race; and allows us to believe that the agricultural 
population was but little disturbed.” Economically it 
was certainly not disturbed by the Romans. If the 
agricultural implements known to and used by the 
Romans were never used in Britain after their depar- 
ture; if the old methods of land-surveying under the 
agrimensores is not to be traced in Britain as a con- 
tinuing system; if wattle and daub, rude, uncarpentered 
trees turned root upwards to form roofs, were the lead- 
ing principles of house-architecture, it cannot be alleged 
that the Romans left behind any permanent marks of 
their economical standard upon the ‘‘little disturbed 
agricultural population.” Why, then, should they be 
credited with the introduction of a system of lordship 
and serf-bound tenants, when both lordship and serf- 
dom are to be traced in lands where Roman power has 
never penetrated, under conditions almost exactly 
similar to the feudal elements in Europe? If it be ac- 
cepted that the early agricultural population of Britain 
was non-Aryan; if we find non-Aryan agricultural rites 
and festivals surviving as folklore among the peasants 
2A2 
 
-P-A-G-E-422
  362 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
of to-day; why should it be necessary, why should it be 
accepted as a reasonable hypothesis, to go to the 
imperial and advanced economics of Rome to account 
for those other elements in the composition of the 
village community which, equally with the rites and 
festivals, are to be found paralleled among the non- 
Aryan population living under an Aryan lordship in 
India? The only argument for such a process is one of 
convenience. It does so happen that the Roman theory 
may account for some of the English phenomena. But, 
then, the Celtic and Teutonic, or Aryan theory also 
accounts for the same English phenomena, and, what 
is more, it accounts for other phenomena not reckoned 
by the Roman theory. My proposition is that the 
history of the village community in Britain is the 
history of the economical condition of the non-Aryan 
aborigines ; that the history of the tribal community is 
the history of the Aryan conquerors, who appear as 
overlords; and that the Romans, except as another 
wave of Aryan conquerors at an advanced stage of 
civilisation, had very little to do with shaping the 
village institutions of Britain.? 
It is necessary before leaving this subject to take note 
of a point which may lead, and in fact has led to mis- 
conception of the argument. I have stated that all 
custom, rite, and belief which is Aryan custom, rite, and 
belief, as distinct from that which is pre-Aryan—pre- 
Celtic in our own country—must have a position in 
the tribal system, and I have said that custom, rite, 
1 The substance of this part of my subject, with more elaboration in 
detail, is taken from a paper I contributed to the T7vansactions of the 
Folklore Congress, 1891.
-P-A-G-E-423

and belief which cannot be traced back to the tribal 
system may be safely pronounced to be pre-tribal in 
origin and therefore pre-Celtic, to have survived, 
that is, from the people whom the Celts found in occupa- 
tion of the country when first they landed on its shores. 
I did not interrupt my statement of the case to point 
out one important modification of it, because this modi- 
fication has nothing to do with the great mass of custom 
and belief now surviving as folklore, but I will deal 
with this modification now so that I may clear up any 
misconception. We have already ascertained that over 
and above the custom and belief, which may be traced 
back to their tribal origins, there are both customs and 
beliefs which owe their origin to psychological con- 
ditions, and there are myths surviving as folk-tales or 
legends which owe their origin to the primitive philo- 
sophy of earliest man. Neither of these depart- 
ments of folklore enters into the question of race 
development. The first may be called post-ethnologic 
because they arise in a political society of modern 
civilisation which transcends the boundaries of race; 
the second may be called pre-ethnologic, because 
they arise in a savage society before the great races 
had begun their distinctive evolution. The point 
about this class of belief is that it has never been 
called upon to do duty for social improvement and 
organisation, has never been specialised by the Celt 
or Teuton in Europe, nor by other branches of the 
same race. The myth alone of these two groups 
of folklore could have had an ethnological influence, 
and this must have been very slight. It remained in 
the mind of Aryan man, but has never descended to the  
-P-A-G-E-424
364 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
arena of his practical life. It has influenced his practical 
life indirectly of course, but it has never become a brick 
in the building up of his practical life. This distinction 
between custom and belief which are tribal and custom 
and belief which are not tribal, is of vast importance. It 
has been urged against the classification of custom, rite, 
and belief into ethnological groups that it does not allow 
for the presence of a great mass of belief, primitive in 
character and undoubtedly Aryan, if not in origin at all 
events in fact. The objection is not valid. The custom, 
rite, and belief which can be classified as distinctively 
Aryan is that portion of the whole corpus of primitive 
custom, rite, and belief, which was used by the Aryan- 
speaking folk in the building up of their tribal organisa- 
tion. They divorced it by this use from the general 
primitive conceptions, and developed it along special 
lines. It is in its special characteristics that this belief 
belongs to the tribal system of the Aryans, not in its 
general characteristics. Not every custom, rite, and be- 
lief was so used and developed. The specialisation caused 
the deliberate rejection or neglect of much custom, rite, 
and belief which was opposed to the new order of things, 
and did not affect the practical doings of Aryan life. 
There are thus three elements to consider: (1) the 
custom, rite, and belief specialised by the Aryan-speak- 
ing people in the formation and development of their 
tribal system ; (2) the custom, rite, and belief rejected 
or neglected by the Aryan tribesmen; and (3) the 
belief which was not affected by or used for the tribal 
development, but which, not being directly antagonistic 
to it, remained with the primitive Aryan folk as sur- 
vivals of their science and philosophy. 
 
-P-A-G-E-425
  ETHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 365 
For ethnological purposes we have only to do with 
the first group. It is definite, and it is capable of 
definite recognition within the tribe. When once it 
was brought into the tribal system it ceased to exist in 
the form in which it was known to general savage 
belief; it developed highly specialised forms, took its 
part in the formation of a great social force, a great 
fighting and conquering force, a great migratory force. 
In accomplishing this task it grew into a solid system, 
each part in touch with all other parts, each part an 
essential factor in the ever-active forces which it helped 
to fashion and control. 
It is in this wise that we must study its survivals 
wherever they are to be found, and the study must be 
concentrated within certain definite ethnographic areas. 
If I were to pursue the subject and choose for my 
study the folklore of Britain, I should have to object to 
the treatment accorded to British custom, rite, and 
belief by even so great an authority as Mr. Frazer, 
because they are used not as parts of a tribal system 
but as mere detritus of a primitive system of science, or 
philosophy. According to my views they had long since 
become separated from any such system and it is placing 
them in a wrong perspective, giving them a false value, 
associating them with elements to which they have no 
affinity to divorce them from their tribal connection. The 
custom, rite, and belief which were tribal, when they were 
brought to their present ethnographic area, cannot be 
considered in the varied forms of their survival except 
by restoration to the tribal organisation from which 
they were torn when they began their life as survivals. 
What I have endeavoured to explain in this way are 
 
-P-A-G-E-426
  366 FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE 
the principles which should govern folklore research 
in relation to ethnological conditions. The differing 
races which made up the peoples of Europe before the 
era of political history must have left their distinctive 
remains in folklore, if folklore is rightly considered as 
the traditional survivals of the prehistory period. To 
get at and classify these remains we must be clear as 
to the problems which surround inquiry into them. 
The solution of these problems will place us in posses- 
sion of a mass of survivals in folklore which are 
naturally associated with each other, and which stand 
apart from other survivals also naturally associated 
with each other. In these two masses we may detect 
the main influences of the great tribal races and the 
non-tribal races. We cannot, I think, get much 
beyond this. We may, perhaps, here and there, 
detect smaller race divisions—Celtic, Teutonic, Scan- 
dinavian or other distinctions, according to the area 
of investigation—but these will be less apparent, 
less determinable, and will not be so valuable to 
historical science as the larger division. To this we 
shall by proper investigation be indebted for the 
solution of many doubtful points of the prehistoric 
period, and it is in this respect that it will appeal to 
the student of folklore.

Such a plan finds its corollary in the use of questions: renin 
‘each chapter ‘in ‘textbooks and will in time:no doubt bé cartied. 
interspersing the questions in a sort of outline in the body: of: the, text. 
The absence of an outline of the typical form:is due to the fact: that.the 
author considers it desirable for the student to make: ‘his own putline 
thereby getting training in organization of material which is invaluable. 
Moreover each instructor will want to stress different topies and prob- 
‘lems and there is greater freedom allowed in. this way. : heen 
For the content and the point of view, indebtedness, is. especially 
acknowledged to Professors Thorndike and Woodworth and to Profes- 
sor Strong, a pupil of both, whose book, Introductory ‘Psychology’ for 
Teachers, has been the most hopeful of all experiments in ‘psychologiz- 
ing psychology. There is a great deal. of borrowing without: reference, 
because the authors who are from time to time referred to have given 
us notions of such value that they have become incorporated into’ ‘our 
thinking. For example, every student and teacher of ndings of & un- 
wittingly utilizes constantly without recognition the ‘findings that 
‘renowned pioneer of modern psychology, William James. ay ys 
While there are no doubt inconsistencies, as is characteristic. of 
many of our best. texts and as is almost certain to be true in a, transi- 
tional ‘period in a subject, the author aims at.a moderate behavioristic 
point of view.. The time does not seem to have come. when we can dis- 
pense entirely with the older terminology and many of the contribu- 
tions of the older school of psychology represented best perhaps by An- 
gell and James. However the author has found some of the behavioris- 
tic conceptions very fruitful in his own thinking and that of his pupils, 
and is inclined to believe that in the next decade or so there will be 
found a way to harmonize the two somewhat widely divergent. schools 
of present-day psychological thought. 
The outline was originally written for the use of students whe, 
just out of high school.. The problems are those of. general psycho! Siéby 
in the main with the emphasis on personal-practical values. , This course 
at the Harrisonburg State Teachers College is followed, as seems to be 
rather typically the case, by a course in educational psychology.; ‘There 
is now available a syllabus in the latter subject by the same author, 
stressing the learning process and individual differences. - Bach. is a      
unit. by.itself and, may.be used independently. Earlier editions of this 
syllabus have been used in about equal numbers in normal schools ; and 
colleges, 
the. syllabus was first cast in the printed rather than the. ‘mimeo- graphed form. begause of repeated requests for, copies as the result of the fact that at the 1922 session of the Department of. Superinten nce 
of the National Education Association, a Committee on Standards and Surveys of the Association of Presidents of State Teachers Colleges 
announced it as the prize syllabus of those offered for this Committee’, Ss, 
consideration. In this fourth edition a few errors have been eliminated 
and such additions made as the author believes will make the booklet more usable. He values and has tried to utilize the suggestions made by his fellow-teachers of the subject, especially those who have used the 
former editions of this syllabus. He covets further criticisms, hoping to make the outline a more valuable tool in the hands of instructors and students alike.

    “STATEMENT TO THE STUDENT 
: This. course unlike a good many courses stresses thinking rather 
‘thai, tiemorization of facts.. This latter should follow logically and is 
.D vided’ for in reviews and by a certain amount of paralleling of the 
t term’s ‘work with that of the second. Problem-solving has long 
n held to be a good method of study, but it is infrequently incor- 
‘porated. into textbooks. Therefore after ten years of trying out various 
‘texts, the instructor has devised these questions based on experience and 
most of them used at.some time, hoping the course will be easier, more 
practicable, more tangible, and better rounded out than otherwise: it 
_ Would, be. 
"Method of Daily Preparation. Ordinarily the method of preparation 
“may weil include (1) reviewing the previous lesson, writing a, brief 
“Jgummary or making an outline, (2) reading the introductory state- 
“ment of the author, and then (3). reading the exercises. (4) You 
would: then take up the yeading or readings and seek to answer the 
“questions and work the exercises: It is an excellent plan to do some 
: _ reviewing (recalling or relearning), before the class meets. for its 
| recitation. 
          Assignments Uneven. You will find the assignments uneven as it is 
not possible to find topics of equal value or difficulty for each lesson, 
..,or if they could be so weighted for one person they would not be such 
for another. Consequently, expect to spend more time on one lesson 
than on another, The instructor does not expect you to spend all 
your time on this course, but hopes the time will run about as in 
other courses. 
Ability to Answer Questions. This will vary much and you may find 
questions that prove an absolute stumbling-block, others that you are 
pot. certain about, and others where you misinterpret the problem and 
will have to be set right in class. Don’t feel that it is your right to 
come to class unprepared, but do feel that it is the business of the 
recitation to clear up difficulties. 
-Readings. As students vary greatly in their rate of reading, no 0 absolute 
requirement in most cases is laid down. No one would read all the 
: references made with each lesson and there is some danger of read- 
ing too much as well as of reading too little. The instructor will t us- 
ually discuss the readings on each topic in advance. 
‘Note-Taking. It is probably desirable to take some notes on what you 
read, at least outside of your text-book. You should, in your reading 
notes, not fail to give the author credit by noting the name and also 
| preferably the page and chapter of text on the margin or elsewhere. 
. With exercises to guide you, read such references or parts as give 
“ you the answers and then stop unless your interest carries you further. 
2 The’ ‘righthand page was left blank for notes, but to provide suffi- 
2 cient space it would be well to place extra sheets between the pages 
of the syllabus at the beginning of the course. Leave space in an- 
swering, for class notes.. Your syllabus will be a better permanent 
possession if, when you unstaple. it for your note-book, you protect 
‘the eyelets with Dennison rings and put away the cover until you 
finish the course. ,

EXPERIMENT REPORTS: GENERAL DIRECTIONS 
‘Note: It is important to learn to report accurately the results and con- 
- clusions drawn-from a study of anything experimentally whether it 
be chemistry, biology, or psychology. The following outline is brief 
“cand should: be followed closely unless the instructor suggests that 
itis not necessary to do so in the case of a given experiment. 
When the instructor returns an experiment or other report to 
you, place it in the proper place in your note-book. 
Experiment Reports , : 
1. Statement of the Problem. This may be and preferably should be, 
in the form of a question which you hope to answer, altho it will 
not always be easy or worth while to put it in this form. 
2. Materials and Procedure. If the experiment is at all complex, it is 
well to divide your statement ‘concerning each of these matters, say 
by having different paragraphs. If you vary in any respect from the 
method laid down by the instructor, note it here. You will ordinar- 
ily not be censured for such a variation but your conclusions are cer- 
tain to be different and-as a good experimenter you want to be ac- 
curate in every detail. . 
3. Results. The results will include all tabulations, charts, and facts 
that grow out of your experimentation. Sometimes this will require 
a separate sheet, for example, of graph paper; this should be placed 
here and not at the end or beginning of your report. 
4. Conclusions. In this part of the report it is important that you dis- 
cuss freely the results, using your former reading, introspections, - 
and class discussions where they apply, and that you may note any 
laws, or applications and interpretations of a practical nature, or 
any problems that are not answered but are of interest and appar- 
ent value. This is the part of the report that requires thought and . 
eare ordinarily. 
. General. Directions 
Not always but frequently two people will work together, E the experimenter or one in charge of the experiment and S the subject upon whom the experiment is performed and who observes or introspects. Usually E and S alternate; after the first performance of the experi- 
ment they change places and perform it a second time. 
Each time before handing in your report make sure of the following items for the sake of uniformity and ease of looking over the papers: (1) that the date and hour and name of the writer-up of the experiment are placed in the upper righthand corner of the sheet, (2) that the name of E and S appear in the lefthand corner and (3) that all sheets of the renort be securely fastened together with a pin or paper clip.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION 
Lesson 1. What Psychology is 
Our first problem naturally is to find out something about this study 
which, because it is new and different from anything you have studied 
« before, may seem difficult at first, but which, because it concerns you 
and your friends, and your future pupils, ought to prove a most interest- 
ing and fascinating study. Do not read any of the references until you 
read thru the questions. Probably the most interesting reference to- 
day is that to Strong’s Introductory Psychology for Teachers. If you 
read that, note how he illustrates various kinds or branches of the 
subject of psychology from stories, newspaper accounts, and similar 
material to that you are reading every day. 
You will do well to take the cue from Strong, and form the habit 
early of bringing to class materials which you glean in your reading 
elsewhere which bear upon the problems or topics of this course. The 
instructor will usually be glad to discuss them and they may be made 
a part of your note-book. : 
References: Strong, ch. 1; Pyle, ch. 1; Pillsbury, ch. 1; Warren, 
ch. 1; Angell, ch. 1; Woodworth, ch. 1; or any other good general text 
in psychology if these are not available. Exercise 1 below, is adapted 
from Thorndike, E. P., p. 2. 
1. Which of the following terms refer to mental facts? To physical 
facts? Which may refer to either? How? Gas, tree, sympathy, 
money, desire, wish, dog, dream, headache, inventiveness, pound, 
taste, intelligence, heavy, sour, oxygen, fatigue, load, pleasure, re- 
member, image, idea, brain, stone, suggestion. 
To what kind of facts do the following refer: race, fashion, custom, 
family, government, mob? 
2. What is suggested to your mind about the relationship of the three 
groups of sciences listed below, i. e. how are they dependent upon 
each other: physiology (and biology), psychology, and sociology? 
Is psychology likely to utilize, or to be more or less dependent upon 
the sciences of physiology, chemistry, physics, mathematics ? 
8. If you read Strong, what do you notice regarding the variety of 
problems of psychology? What are the kinds of psychology you 
find in reading this chapter, e. g. animal psychology, adolescent 
psychology, psychology of advertising, etc? Can you suggest other 
branches of the subject? 
4, If you were to study and describe a physical object, as for example 
a river, you might take into account especially its characteristics, its 
size, its appearance, the composition of its water and so forth; or 
you might consider on the other hand its functions as illustrated in 
furnishing water-power and in watering what otherwise would be 
an arid country. In a somewhat similar way, it is possible to think . 
of the mind or human nature as the sum total of mental processes - 
or states which make it up, or on the other hand to think of it in 
terms of activity and conduct. Psychologists consequently usually 
either define psychology as the science of consciousness or of be-. 
havior. »Which definition fits each notion? What are the limitations 
of each? . 
5. If, as Woodworth does, we were to describe psychology as the study 
of mental life, how does this idea fit in with exercise 1 above? Ex- 
ercise 3? Does this idea of psychology seem to have advantages 
over the others suggested in exercise 4? How does it help you to: 
harmonize these two viewpoints? Later on it will be important for 
you to determine upon a fuller definition of psychology, and one 
which expresses your views and knowledge of the subject.

‘Lesson.2. Methods Used in Psychology 
‘ In the first lesson you found out something about the study of 
psychology ;- therefore, before you begin the new lesson, write a para- - 
graph of perhaps 100 to 150 words at the end of the class-notes of the 
last lesson, summing up that lesson, briefly and simply, under the 
question, “What is Psychology?” Just as that lesson dealt largely 
with the problem of the subject-matter content of psychology, so this 
one will deal with the methods used. This is very important because, 
while a member of this course at least, you are to be a psychologist, and 
as far as you are able with so little experience and training, you will 
want to rediscover many of the things discovered by trained students 
of the subject and, by application of what they have found, to be able 
to improve your methods of work and study. One aim of your work 
might be that suggested by Professor Seastiore, ‘““Not psychology, but to: 
psychologize.” Do not read or. study exércise 5 below. 
References: Consult the early chapters, usually the first or second 
of several texts in psychology under the heading “methods” to find their 
point of view concerning the methods of ‘the subject; Pillsbury, Pyle, 
Angell, Titchener, Cameron, Averill, Woodworth, Warren. . 
1. Make a list or table of the methods discussed by the different authors 
you read, giving credit to each for that. which he mentions, and not- 
ing agreement and ‘disagreement amotig them. What seems to be 
the fundamental difference between psychology and other natural 
sciences in the matter of method, e. g. chemistry and botany? 
2. Titchener says “the method of psychology is observation.”” How do 
you tie up with this the methods of introspection and experiment? 
What are the different kinds of observation? 
3. To which type of method is the “behavior” psychologist, who is like- 
ly to work with animals, biased? The “consciousness psychologist? 
Why? What are the comparative and genetic methods? : 
4. Whatever methods are being used, there are certain precautions re- 
garding the tabulation of results and their use that must be borne 
in mind. What are some of these? 
5. Class experiments illustrative of psychological method: 
a, The instructor will display a number of advertisements and the 
students will arrange them in an order of merit. Why do you place 
them in this order? That is, what different effect does the best one 
have upon you?’ Why do you like one best? . 
At a given signal “Go,” the instructor will ask you to begin mak- 
ing short vertical marks upon a paper, for a period of one-half min- 
‘ute. How many do you make in comparison with other members of 
the class? What helping or hindering ideas went thru your mind ? 
ec. The instructor will ask 15 or 20 members to stand in a circle so 
that all are facing clockwise. Ata signal Go” one member will 
touch the one in front, etc., until the a who began is touched. 
The instructor will keep the time and-the average gives what may be called the simple reaction-time for the average member of the 
group. . 
d. Which of the above experiments illustrates the method of intro- 
spection? Of experiment? Do they form @ sort of series as regard 
methods used? . . a

    Lesson 3. The Major Problems in Psychology 
- Until very recently, psychologists, as indeed many other people to- 
day, thought.of the mind as a set of more or less independent functions 
~ -or faculties, such as memory, reasoning, perception, and so forth. Today 
‘we are apt to liken it to a well organized telephone system, with its 
central, its connecting wires, and its receivers and transmitters. In 
other words we try to think of it as a unitary machine or organism, now 
learning, now thinking, now remembering, in rapid succession or indeed 
perhaps simultaneously. While a flower is no longer a flower when 
“you have taken it to pieces for study in the botany class, and the mind 
is no longer mind when you analyze it into the functions that make it 
up, nevertheless we shall have to take up these interrelated and closely 
interwoven functions separately to come to know something of them in 
detail. Today we shall make a brief acquaintance with a large num- 
per of them in preparation for the more detailed study of the rest of the 
term. 
References: Consult tables of contents or indexes of any one or 
more of the psychology texts noted in previous lessons. But as usual 
read the exercises below first. ‘It would be interesting, after studying 
exercise 1, to pick out the different mental processes in the story given 
in Colvin and Bagley, pp. 3-4, or to read some colorful poetic or prose 
selection with this purpose in mind. 
1. -In the following paragraph is a hypothetical experience, in which a 
number of these major psychological functions of the mind are 
found. The words used to indicate them are in bold face, and where 
they gre not used in the text they are listed in parentheses following 
the phrase or clause of description: 
J Suppose during a vacation, you are going down town and 
y suddenly as. you walk along recalling experiences of the day be- 
fore (memory), a puff of smoke and a shrill noise (sensation), 
¢ which you immediately interpret as indications of an incoming 
train (perception), arrest your attention. You quicken your 
step at the thought that perhaps some of. your friends who are 
away at school may be returning on this train, and decide (will) 
to go to the depot in the earnest hope (emotion) that you may 
meet them. You arrive in time and your curiosity (instinct) is 
satisfied, but there is no friend. You then turn your steps up 
the street as you have been accustomed to do many previous 
Ai (habit) and are soon at.your original destination. 
‘After you have thought over these experiences many of which 
follow one another in more rapid succession than they can be de- 
scribed and have tried to determine their meaning, turn to some text 
in psychology and find a psychologist’s definition. Couch each in as 
simple terms as possible and give credit to the author in your notes.    Perhaps'the following order would be best; instinct, habit, emotion,. 
sensation, perception, attention, memory, thought, will or volition. 
The following form of brief description might be used :-—‘Instincts 
: illustration... 
analyze some on 
ing or kindred experiences: (a) sitting in the classroom when some- 
oneis:reciting or the teacher is lecturing, (b) at the breakfast table, 
or (¢) at the study desk with perhaps your history text open before 
you noting which of the mental functions listed in 1 above are to be 
found, and what others. Write up your experience to hand in, 
beginning somewhat as follows: “While sitting at my desk at half 
Wight O'CLOCK anceceeccmersenn , and following the plan of the illustration 
above, , 
As this is your first experience in handing in work, establish the 
habit of indicating the lesson and exercise, as follows—Lesson 3, 
eX. 4.

Lesson 4. Situation, Bond, and Response  . 
‘ore we turn to the detailed study of these large problems, it 
aportant to get a point of view that has recently come into psy- 
chology, and that will undoubtedly. help you to keep in mind this unitary 
nature of mental life as we work withthe different mental processes. 
That point of view is that all mental life or consciousness or behavior, 
may be thought of as being comprised of situations or stimuli (singular, 
stimulus), and bonds or connections, and responses or reactions. We 
shall use the letters, S, B, and R, to denote these and try today to get a 
preliminary view of these terms and their meanings. This lesson should 
be ef special profit to you if you apply the idea to what you do in study 
or.recitation or at any time during your waking life or indeed in your 
dream life, that is, that always you are reacting to situations presented 
and that you are reacting in one way and not another because certain 
bonds have been inherited or learned. 
_ References: Freeman, ch. 1; Warren, ch. 3; Woodworth, chs. 2-4; 
Strong, chs. 2,3. Unfortunately, there are few good references on this 
subject but that may make it all the more interesting if you will follow 
thru the problems suggested below. Most recent-texts treat these topics 
riefly. 
1. If someone should make a thrust at your face, you would wink. 
Similarly, if when you have your knees crossed, some one should 
strike the upper knee, the foot would fly up. What is S and what is 
R in each case? Do you also get a notion of what B is like? 
2. When you are called upon in this class (S) and make answer (R), 
what do you notice about S compared with Sin 1 above? Name in 
detail in this case all the things that go to make up the S. Is the R 
similarly complex? Are most S’s and R’s complex or simple? 
8. In the following illustrations, note wherever possible, what, if any, 
of the mental functions discussed in Lesson 3 are present, e. g. if one 
unexpectedly comes upon an old friend (perception), one is first 
struck with surprise (emotion) and then reaches out the hand in 
greeting (habit) : 
Situation Responses 
Person hears loud noise Person thinks “thunder” 
Pupil sees word “s-c-h-o-o-1” Pupil thinks “school” 
Person hears loud noise Person jumps 
Teachér calls pupil’s name Pupil goes to board 
Person thinks of mail Person goes to postoffice box 
Person sees approaching auto Person steps back in fear 
4, The connections between S’s and R’s are called B’s. What is the dif- 
ference between the bonds in-1 and 8 above, i. e. which are learned 
and which do not need to be learned? Try now to state the meaning 
_ of the terms S, R, and B. 
5. What is teaching and what is learning, in terms of these three 
words or concepts? What, in these terms also, is the purpose of 
the classroom recitation? 
6. Now look back to your summary of Lesson 1 and see how you might 
profitably supplement it or change it to incorporate this new idea of mental life. Can you take a given period of your life, say five min- 
utes of the classroom period, and analyze it into the S’s and R’s that 
goto make it up? (See Lesson 5, exercise 2). 
¢ 10)
-P-A-G-E-11
Lesson 5. Review 
_ As far as possible it will be important for you to proceed in this 
course according to the recognized laws and principles of psychology. 
Information to be usable must not only be learned but reviewed or re- . 
learned. It is going to be a valuable thing for you at this time to see 
(1)-how quickly and fully you recognize the points which you have 
taken up and learned in preceding lessons, (2) how difficult or easy 
these principles or facts now seem to you as compared with the first 
time. you came upon them in your. reading or class discussion, and (3) 
how’ well you have formed the habit of keeping your readings and other 
work up-to-date. If you have never tried the habit, it will be very much 
worth while to make an effort now to substitute for last-minute prepara- 
tion. of your psychology lesson, the practice of studying it immediately 
after your recitation (or as shortly after as you have time). What has 
.. this ‘suggestion to do with the matter of learning as making bonds? Are 
you forming the habit of keeping your notes up-to-date? 
1. Make up an outline-digest of the material covered thus far in the 
course. It can follow fairly closely @e outlines of the preceding les- 
sons and should not have too many main topics. The instructor will 
:Be of any help he can in shaping this up after you. come to class. 
-By the term digest, is meant the idea that an outline, to be useful, 
can not be a mere skeleton, but should include descriptive phrases 
-and clauses, e. g., if you wanted to include the topic, “Two opposing 
view of psychology,” you would not follow this simply with “(a) 
consciousness and (b) behavior,” but rather with “(a) conscious- 
ness: the description of the contents of mind, its different processes, 
(Cb) behavior tees 
2. As a supplement especially to lesson 4, and a review (this word 
means a new view), write to hand in, a list of 20 situations and their 
-.appropriate responses, as in exercise 8, Lesson 4. It would be valu- 
able if you would make a few of these apply to preceding lessons, 
e. g. “Hear the word situation—Think of psychology class.” Or it 
would be excellent to select experiences out of your daily life, secur- 
ing as much variety as time allows.

CHAPTER II. PHYSICAL BASIS OF MENTAL LIFE 
Lesson 6. Relation of Mind and Body: Nervous System, Neurone, 
Synapse 
The purpose of this and the next two lessons is to give you a work- 
ing notion of the physical basis or background of your mental life. It 
may. seem to you that itis really a study of physiology, but it is rather 
physiological psychology. Probably it could have been omitted or 
placed differently in the course but the author’s experience is that it 
proves helpful to have this background early if it is not made too de- 
tailed or technical. Just as one is better able to understand the pro- 
ducts of a country if one understands the physical conditions underly- 
ing those products, the nature of the soil, the. rock formation, the direc- 
tion and nature of the winds, so you will understand memory, percep- 
tion, and thought better if you get a few accurate notions about the 
nervous system and its functioning. 
It will be valuable for you to begin at this time outlining your les- 
sons either before or after the recitation or both, and it may be very 
much worth while to continue making the brief paragraph summaries. 
It may be that one will be sufficient. 
References: While practically all elementary texts in psychology 
have chapters on the nervous system, it may be best for every one dur- 
ing these next three periods, to make use largely of the following: 
Strong, chs. 51-58; Angell, ch. 2; Pillsbury, ch. 2, ch. 3 (pp. 49-57); 
Thorndike, E. P., pp. 120-162 (excellent cuts) ; Woodworth, ch. 2; War- 
ren, ch. 20. If you want a brief statement before you begin the longer 
discussion, see Cameron, ch. 2, or Averill, ch. 3. 
1. Can you imagine a body without a mind or a mind without a body? 
What is the relationship of the two? What evidence have we that 
the mind depends upon physical structures? 
2. What is that part of the body called which forms the physical basis 
of mental life (consciousness, behavior) ? What are the main parts? 
What may be said to be its main functions? Explain this last in 
terms of S, R, B, if possible. 
3. What are the general physical characteristics of each of the nerve 
cells, or neurones? Be able to draw at least three dissimilar types 
and label the parts. . 
4. How are functions of the nerve cells unlike and how like those of 
other cells? Into what three general classes are the neurones divid- 
ed according to function, and where is each largely located ? 
5. What is the nervous current? What are the important facts about 
it, its rate, its paths, etc.? 
6. What is the synapse? Describe and diagram it. Note in this con- 
nection, the probable function of each part of the neurone. What 
is the relation of the synapse to the bond (B)? Does it appear that 
the notion of bond is as important as those of stimulus and response? 
Apply the concept of the synapse to the illustrations in lesson 4, 
exs, 1-3.

Lesson 7. The Three Levels of Response 
In the last lesson we saw how the central nervous system is the 
basis of mental life, how it is composed of simple élemen e nerve 
cells), and how they join at the synapse, thus making possible the trans- 
mission of the nervous impulse. Today we shall study action or be- 
havior, some of it not ordinarily conscious, and some of it representing 
the most complicated acts that the human organism can perform. Do 
not expect to be able to answer all of the questions without reading.

57; Warren, p. 37. 
1. If you prick your hand slightly, it will be withdrawn involuntarily 
thru reflex action, the contro] being on the lower level and thru the 
spinal cord.| Show how in turn (a) the mid-brain and (b) the cere- 
brum become involved when (a) the prick is severe enough that you 
are led’ to make a more vigorous response bringing into play other 
parts of the body, and (b) still more severe so that you look at the 
injured -spot, consciously try to remove the offending object, and 
may even consider further the question of the possibility of poison 
from it (Strong, Book II, p. 193). What are these three levels call- 
ed and what distinguishes each from the other? Is it probable that 
within the highest level, there are really several levels? . 
  2. Make an effort to find several illustrations of response on each of © 
these three levels. 
i 
_ 8. Diagram each level in general terms or with the illustrations of exer- 
cise 1 in mind. 
4, Be ready to discuss the following statements: 
i. Responses of the lower level are inherited or unlearned; 
ii. Responses of the second level are probably also unlearned, but 
may depend in part, upon learning, e. g. co-ordinated responses; 
iii. Responses of the third level have to do with learning and com- 
plex movements and include, therefore, the most automatic ha- 
its as well as the most elaborate reasoning. 
5. Tifere are two conceptions you are apt to come across that it may be 
important to note before we leave this topic. (i) A number of the 
behaviorists are inclined to the view that all higher mental responses 
-—memories, perceptions, sentiments, thoughts—are composed of 
simple reflexes. (ji) In popular psychology, one frequently notes 
a confusion between inborn reflexes and mechanical habits, as for 
example the writing of an experienced typist, and the notion that in 
the latter case as in the former, the control is on the lower levels. . 
What are your reactions to each of these concepts? What facts 
seem to refute the first? What the second? .

Lesson 8, Cerebral Activity: Review 
In preparing for today’s study, go back over the main concepts 
you have been thinking about in the two previous lessons, the nature 
and function of the central nervous system, the neurone and its struc- 
ture and functions, the synapse, and the three levels of response. Bring 
to class any questions:about matters that are not clear, as they will 
prove rea] stumbling blocks in the future. Today -we shall concern. 
ourselves particularly with mental life (behavior, consciousness) of the 
third level. You will bring to class to hand in,one diagram under 
exercise 1 and one diagram under exercise 2, and oh a separate sheet, 
an answer to question 4. The instructor will explain and illustrate 2 
before you begin your work, that is, in the assignment. 
References: See lesson 6. Woodworth, ch. 3; Warren, p. 4; Strong 
chs. 51, 58. 
1. Draw a rough diagram of the exterior of the left hemisphere of the 
cerebrum, and locate the two great fissures, and the more certainly 
localized areas as to function, e. g. visual, motor, tactual, and audi- 
tory. It will help you to remember these locations if you will run 
the hand over the side of the skull as you study the diagram. (A 
model will be brought to class). . 
2. Diagram as accurately as is. possible one or more of the following, 
and be able to describe in the large the brain action that takes 
place: 
i. Copying a sentence with a pencil, 
ii. Sewing a rather difficult stitch by hand, 
iii. Reading a sentence aloud, 
iv. Speaking, 
v. Playing the piano by note, 
vi. Answering a question asked by the instructor. 
8. What are the physiological aspects of situation, bond, and response 
(8, B, and R)? (Strong, Book II, pp. 204, 225). State carefully 
and rather fully what is meant by each of these terms. Do you feel 
that you understand better the problems raised in Chapter I, espec- 
ially in lessons 3-5? Are you using these concepts in your daily ob- 
gervation and thinking? 
4. Since this is a difficult subject and because the habit is one worth 
your cultivating, make an outline-digest of Chapter II, using the 
same title. However feel free to change the organization to suit 
your needs. Take care that the emphasis is not so much upon the 
physiology as upon the bearing of the facts of physiology upon men- 
al life. :

CHAPTER III. ORIGINAL NATURE: HEREDITY, 
INSTINCTS, EMOTIONS 
Before beginning this new topic, take a couple of minutes to note 
the “Statement to the Student” at the beginning of this syllabus and to 
raise the question as to what part, if any, you have been slighting. Has 
your instructor also apparently neglected to bear any part of it in 
mind? 
Lesson 9. Heredity: Its Laws and Contributions 
In this lesson the purpose will be served if you gain a clear notion 
of the importance of heredity, that stock of original nature with which 
we humans start in life. The two factors, heredity and environment, 
“nature and nurture,” are responsible for the vast multitude of respons- 
es that we make daily. ‘In most cases they are so complicated and the 
effects of heredity and environment are so intertwined that it is hard 
to distinguish them. The practice of trying, however, is excellent, as 
it leads one to appreciate each the more. It might be said in this con- 
nection, that there was at one time a considerable controversy as to 
which was more important, but this is hardly a valuable question, altho 
you will probably find yourself leaning to one or the other, heredity or 
environment. 
References: Perhaps the best available reference is Norsworthy 
and Whitley, ch. 1. Other references are: Pyle, ch. 2; Woodworth, chs. 
4, 5; Averill, chs. 4-6; Thorndike, B. C., ch. 1; Strong (see index). 
. Write out to hand in, a list of say half a dozen physical traits in 
yourself and others, such as brown @éyés, red hair, short-fingered- 
ness, unusual height, etc., and in a parallel column, the ancestor or 
parent to whom this seems to be traceable. 
\. Make a similar table to hand in, trying to be rather more careful of 
your facts, of mental traits, e. g. musical ability, inventiveness, ex- 
cellent memory, etc. 
8. In such common habits as eating, walking, talking, and observing 
things as you pass along the street, can you trace to some extent at 
least, the inherited and acquired responses? 
4. What is the difference between blended and alternate inheritance? 
Cite illustrations. Which do you think is probably more important? 
The hereditary contributions seem to be from three sources, race, 
sex, and family (or near ancestry). Can you suggest illustrations of 
each? What is the value to a teacher, of the hypothesis, “Given a 
white boy of the Hugh Smith family,” ... i. e. can certain conclu- 
sions be drawn about the child’s probable school achievements? 
~, If the father in this case is a well-educated lawyer with a special in- 
terest in social welfare in his commrunity, will these acquisitions af- 
fect the son’s original nature? Why? What is the value of this fact 
and the knowledge of it to the teacher? : 
7.. It seems to be proved that the line of inheritance is thru the germ 
plasm which is quite distinct from the body plasm and that the in- 
dividual’s abilities are determined at the time of the fertilization of 
the ovum. What importance has this fact for the minister, the 
teacher, the social worker, in fact, any leader in society? 
8. Of the two great laws of heredity that of resemblance, and of varia-. 
tion, one forms the basis of general psychology and the other of in- 
dividual (differential) psychology. Which must this course largely 
take up? Why is the other very important for the parent and 
eacher ?

Lesson 10. Instincts and Their Place in Education 
This lesson will introduce you to the general problems of instincts 
and their treatment, so that nature may become nurture to the greatest 
advantage to the individual and the race. As you study, try to keep in 
mind your own experiences and to review your own education in and out 
of school, and also to think of the activities of younger children of your 
acquaintance. This lesson will be continued in the next, but with refer- 
ence to special instincts, and the subject will be taken up again more 
fully in the course in educational psychology. 
While psychologists have recently come to the conclusion that such 
general terms as curiosity, pugnacity, etc., are really group names for 
scores or even hundreds of specialized tendencies, it will be easier if 
we bear this in mind but follow the general practice of using the older 
terminology. Bear in mind the fact that‘instincts are situation-bond-re- 
sponse combinations that are formed or ‘partially formed thru heredity. 
References: It will be weil to read one of the following references 
only, the rest being given to offer opportunity to find the list of instincts 
which is called for in Lesson 13: Pillsbury, ch. 10; Norsworthy and 
Whitley, pp. 21-31; Pyle, ch. 4; Angell, ch. 15; James, ch. 25; Thorn- 
dike, P. T. ch. 3; Bolton, pp. 140-164; Colvin, pp. 33-63; Woodworth, 
chs. 5, 6, 8; Warren, ch. 10; Strong, chs. 33, 34. 
1. Do humans have less or more native tendencies than the lower ani- 
mals? What is the more important difference between them? I}Hus- 
trate. 
2. Explain briefly the origin or source of instincts according to the bio- 
logical law of natural selection? 
8. Ifa boy is intentionally injured by another, what does he instinctive- 
ly do? If he fails to make this response, what may be the cause? 
Does a soldier instinctively salute his officer? 
yA. Make a list of the differences between reflexes, instincts and capaci- 
ties and find several illustrations of each. Which of these are more 
educable? Which may be ends as well as means in education? 
What are some of the other terms used to denote native tendencies? 
5. What are the traits or characteristics common to human instincts? 
What is the significance of each for education? 
6. What are the various methods that may be used in handling (a) the 
less desirable and (b) the more desirable instincts in home and ° 
school? What are the relative merits of these methods? 
7. From what you have learned thru the above, what would you say as 
to the value of the instincts in the adaptation of the individual to his 
environment? (See Colvin and Bagley, p. 128). 
~ List a half dozen instincts which you have exhibited during the last twenty-four hours. Which are more like original nature and which have been most overlaid with habit?

specialized and individualized capacities, to be handed in with les- son 13.

Lesson 11. Some Important Instincts 
The teacher and the parent, as well as others interested in prob- 
lems of social leadership, find themselves confronted constantly with 
the problem of utilizing the tendencies, which we find in children, and 
this lesson serves the purpose of giving you opportunity to find out some 
of the methods of utilizing a few of the most important instincts. In 
this lesson, do not neglect to find out something about each instinct in 
addition to answering the questions asked, so that if you were asked 
to give a brief description of it you could do so. Furthermore, this 
seems important at this point because it will set you thinking about the 
relation of psychology to teaching, and because it will give many sug- 
gestions regarding yourself and cues as to what to look for and interest 
yourself in, in psychologizing. The instructor will probably want to 
spend two periods with this lesson or to omit some of the exercises. If 
desirable, the applications to education can be ignored.

1, Take some two.or more instincts, e. g. fighting, and indicate care- 
fully the S’s and R’s of which their appearance is made up. 
Sa Can you suggest important uses for the following instincts in the ~ 
school, particularly in the grade of work in which you are interest- 
ed; fighting, collecting, desire of approval, migratory instinct, lead- 
ership, parental instinct, sex instinct? : 
8. In what sense is imitation not an instinct? Note the diversity of ac- 
tivities included under it, that is, of kinds of imitation. Give illustra- 
tions of how imitation may be important and valuable and how it 
may be unfortunate in the second grade, the eighth grade? How 
does imitation change with age? 
4. How can we use the tendency to physical activity? To mental acti- 
vity? Which is relatively more important in the kindergarten? In 
the high school? What course in school may be said to be based 
largely upon each? 
5. Is the curiosity of the 2-year-old child, the 8-year-old child, the 16- 
year-old child, different in important respects? How? How can the 
elementary school make wider use of this important instinct? 
\. Why and how is rivalry frequently misused in school? What are at 
least two important changes in the modern school in the use of rival- 
ry (emulation)? Can you cite good illustrations of use of this in- 
stinct ? 
7. Is there a “social” instinct? Is it the instinct of gregariousness or the 
gang instinct? At what stages of education is this most important . and how can it be best utilized? Cf. first, fifth, and tenth grades. 
8. Play has been called the most fundamental instinct for education. 
Justify this statement if you believe it, and show two extreme view- points regarding play and the school and the desirable middle road. 
9. Speech or language is based upon the instinct of vocalization. How 
is learning to talk a matter large of imitations? What are common errors that need to be corrected in elementary instruction and how do you know they are errors? 
10. Take up at Jeast one subject of the typical primary, or grammar grade, or high school course, and show what natural tendencies might advantageously be relied upon by the teacher as furnishing motive power. Write this out to hand in,

“ Lesson 12, The Emotions, Feelings, and Attitudes 
In this lesson you will study a kindred topic to that of the last two 
lessons, namely the emotions. Like the instincts, they are built upon 
the solid foundation of heredity, but they are capable of much develop- 
7 és, moods, the higher emotions are probably very 
largely a matter of education and training (environment). Some one 
has said that the feelings (emotioéns) are the “mainsprings of life.” 
While therefore the psychologists have not been able as yet to make ex- 
act studies of them, for when one tries to study a feeling it disappears 
from consciousness, yet it is important to get acquainted with the data 
available on this interesting phase of ourselves.

groups? Try similarly to define and illustrate attitudes, moods, 
sentiments, and ideals. What is temperament? —_——

: Lesson 18. Review of Lessons 1-12 
_ In Lesson 5 you saw the advantage of freshening up your informa- 
tion and of checking up on your acquired stock of ideas about psychol- 
ogy. This lesson is given at this time to assist you further in the same 
matters as there is a rather definite break in the subject matter at this 
point. In all likelihood the instructor will want to set a written lesson 
or test over this matter, on account of the peculiar advantage such an 
exercise has in giving the teacher a chance to note the nature of the 
responses of the pupils when he tries to give all a fairly uniform situa- 
_tion. Therefore, some of the questions may be like exercises 1-3, where 
the opportunity of making the situation uniform for all is greater than 
in such questions as “discuss” or “state.” In answering these be entire- 
ly self-reliant the first time and then check up on the answers by refer- 
ence to your notes, your favorite texts, or your room-mate, and make a 
score of the number of correct answers that you made. Write out and 
hand in answers to question 4 on one sheet and question 5 on another 
sheet.

CHAPTER IV. ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
Lesson 14. Nature of Attention 
We now turn for three lessons to the related: problems of attention 
and interest. “You have noticed many times hew teachers, parents and 
others insist upon attention in dealing with children and inferiors. ‘It 
must be important, therefore. You have also'learned by experience, 
_ that you learn more easily when attention and ititerest combine to assist 
you. In‘this lesson the general nature of the..attention processes is 
treated and you will notice that we now turn, as the scientist must 
. sooner. or later do, to the statement of some of the laws of psychology. 
As you study, watch carefully your own attention. There are few 
people who cannot improve their habits of comeentration of attention. 
_ This is not the only test of a good student but is one of the important 
tests, because attention underlies not only habit-formation but reason- 
ing and volition (will).

vin and Bagley, pp. 54-62; Colvin, pp. 251-270; Strayer and Norsworthy

Strong, Book Il, pp. 9-10, 95-98. 
1. If you have ever watched a baby of a few months, you will have 
noticed his giving attention to various features of his environment 
and you may have noticed an apparent parallel in his general men- 
tal development. Are there instinctive tendencies to attentiveness? 
To what sorts of things does a little child seem instinctively to at- 
tend? Note the motor accompaniments of its attention. Do these 
persist with the adult? 
2. Familarize yourself with some discussion of attention so that you 
can illustrate it with some diagram, and explain that diagram, e. g. 
the concentric circles. What is then the concentration of attention? 
Inattention? Dispersed attention? 
8. Remembering, therefore, that the Hecvoroni believes the mind is 
always attentive or that attention is a feature of all conscious acts, 
which is a good definition of attention, or, better still, a brief de- 
scription of attention that will take the place of a definition? Is 
there one essential characteristic of attention? 
4. Be able to define and illustrate the following terms which represent 
aspects of the attention process; duration (rhythm) of attention, 
Span or range of attention, division of attention, distraction of at- 
tention. In this connection it is important to note the differences_in 
these matters between children and adults.

Lesson 15. Nature of Attention (Continued) 
As this lesson is a continuation of lesson 14, see the introductory 
statement to that lesson. Before writing up the experiments it will be 
imperative to look up the introductory statement about “Experiment 
Reports,” and it will be equally important at this point to sketch again 
the “Statement to the Student.” 
References: See Lesson 14. 
1. Be careful to perform the following experiments rigidly so that your 
results will be accurate. This means keeping the directions listed in 
“Experiment Reports” before you, and recording results and intro- 
spections at once. Keep careful records of all 4 experiments and 
hand in report of one of the first three. . 
i. Rhythm (duration) of attention—Let one member of the pair 
listen attentively to the sound of a just audible watch, and respond 
to the fact of the loss of the sound by lowering a pencil held in the 
hend, holding it upright when the sound is sound. Let the other 
member record in the listener’s notebook a series of dots at as nearly 
a uniform rate as follows.....°'° °° , and interpret the result. 
ii. Span or range of attention—Let E take several slips of paper 
of uniform size, say 3 or 4 inches square, and place on them in irreg- 
ular arrangements, dots of uniform size, from 4 to 12 in number. 
Shuffie these into an irregular order and then expose them one at a 
time to S, for the briefest intervals possible for him to estimate the 
number. If time allows, rearrange the slips and expose each a sec~- 
ond time, keeping the record of the guesses. What is S’s attention 
(or perception) span? Is it hard to keep from counting? Does 
memory enter in? . 
iii. Division of attention—Let E hold a watch with a second hand 
and let S in five successive trials, perform the two-fold task of count- 
ing for one minute as rapidly as possible, and of writing the Arabic 
numerals, 1, 2, 3, etc., of the same series as fast as possible. He 
must not allow his writing to slow down the counting so that he 
does not keep ahead. Record introspections, i. e., inhibitions, etc. 
Note what gain, if any, comes with practice, and in the result record 
scores in both ways of counting. What conclusions do you draw 
from the test, as to one’s ability to attend to two things at once? 
Cf. other experiences. 
iv. Distraction of attention—Select a passage of some fifteen or 
twenty lines of printed matter, pick out and check the a’s, or pick 
“out some combination of letters, such as er. Immediately after the 
task record introspections of your consciousness during the act of 
counting and indicate irrelevant impressions, memories, thoughts, 
etc. What conclusions do you draw? 
State law regarding each of the terms listed in question 4 of lesson 
14, and with which you have experimented in question 1 of this les- 
son. If you draw upon some author give him credit, but you can as 
well state them yourself, perhaps. There is probably a general law 
of attention or law of selection; see exercises 2 and 3 of lesson 14. 
Can you state this? There are undoubtedly a good many other laws 
regarding attention and you may if you desire, state any of those. 
A good method would be as follows: Law of repetition—The repe- 
tition of any experience tends to increase its clearness up to a cer- 
tain point.

Lesson 16. Attention and Interest: Practical Application 
In the last two lessons, by reading and experimentation, you aimed 
to find out some of the more important characteristics of the mental pro- 
cesses grouped under the head of attention. It would be unsatisfactory 
to leave this lesson until you have outlined or summarized lessons 14, 
5, and 16. 
In this lesson we shall study the practical bearings of attention 
upon your work as a student and as a prospective teacher. Just as 
therefore, in the last lesson, you gave attention (note how quite by ac- 
cident the writer used the word, but nevertheless used it properly, to the 
laws of attention, today you will be asked naturally to begin to form 
practical ‘conclusions in the way of maxims or rules of practice.

3. Psychologists are fairly well agreed that there are three different 
types of attention, but they are not agreed upon the names. Find 
out what you can about these and consider the desirability of the fol- 
lowing names: primary (or. spontaneous), secondary (or forced), 
and derived primary (or sustained). Be able to illustrate each from 
your own recent experience, or better still, write up an experience in 
which the three kinds of attention are found. 
Among the qualities of stimuli that attract attention are clearness, 
intensity, novelty, pleasurableness and expectedness. Which of these 
are more likely to be connected with each of the three types of at- 
tention? Which should a teacher always seek in situations which 
he presents to the pupil? Which should he use sparingly? Which 
have to do with the importance of stating the aim of the lesson? 
we their value with excessive use? (ef. Thorndike, P. T., 
p. . 
Does interest depend upon knowledge? Do attention and interest 
always go together? What is interest? When, therefore, is a 
thing interesting? Can all school matters be made interesting? If 
not intrinsically interesting, what can be done to secure interest? 
Interests are in immediate or remote ends. Which are more appeal- 
ing to little children? Why? What then must the teacher do? 
Can you cite misuse of this fact in your school experience ? 
Try to analyze your:classroom experience, in the elementary school, 
high school, and college, noting the things that have been 
the occasion of ‘your lagging interest and attention. Write.a para- 
graph under the.caption:or title, “Why my attention lags in class?” 
or list the situations‘in which attention lags. 
State at least three or four very practical maxims for the teacher that grow out of the:exercises in these three lessons on attention and interest, for example, regarding the concentration of attention.

Lesson 18.. Visual, Auditory, and Other Sensations 
Today we are to study other types of sensations, A part of the 
class-work may be given to working out the details of a table listing the 
sense-organs (or receptors), the senses, and the varied stimuli that give 
rise to these responses. There are’ numietous interesting experiments 
which you will find suggested to you, for‘éxample in Strong, Pyle, Pills- 
bury, Woodworth, and Seashore, and whith you may care to try. You 
will want to note rather carefully the nutiber of the senses or kinds of 
sensory experience. ‘If the instructor desires, exercises 2, 3, and 7 might 
be omitted or the whole lesson may be focused in one or two problems. 
On the other hand if time permits, there is an abundance of interesting 
data that would make it possible to exparid this lesson into several les- 
sons, 
References: See lesson 17. 
1. Visual sensations are of two kinds, color (chromatic) and brightness 
(achromatic). Find out the different stimuli of each, the number 
of qualities and be able to draw and explain the color pyramid 
(Pillsbury, Angell, or Titchener), or-color cone (Woodworth). 
2. Explain and be able to illustrate and: note any practical implications 
of any of the following features of visual sensations: negative and 
positive after-images, complementary* colors, visual contrast, adap- 
tation. 
3. Suppose some one were to hold a color before your eyes. Describe 
the complete details of the situation a¥id response, from the moment 
of the reception of the stimulus to the final answer by naming the 
color. If you will actually perform the experiment, you can supple- 
ment this account with some very interesting introspections. 
4, Auditory sensations are likewise of two kinds, tone and noise. Find 
out the difference in stimuli and variety of qualities of each. What 
seems to be the best or most acceptable theory, explaining auditory 
sensations ? . 
5. Find out something about the following sensations and be able to 
illustrate them or give a simple experiment for locating them: olfac- 
tory (smell), gustatory (taste), static, kinesthetic, organic. Do you 
find other names of sensations suggested ? 
2. Which of the sensations seem to develop first in the little child? 
Which later? Which two are most used in education? Are we 
tending to stress others in education today, e. g. kinesthetic? How? 
7. List sense defects which are likely tobe a serious handicap to the child in school. Which of these are-curable? Remediable, at least 
by artificial means? Which neither remediable or curable?

Lesson 19. Perception 
You have just learned that sensations are primary or elementary 
experiences, somewhat as are feelings, instincts and reflexes. We seem 
as adults, seldom, if ever, to have such simple experiences, as they occur 
in connection with each other or with still other experiences. The most 
natural and common complex experiences with which sensations are 
allied or of which they form a part, are perhaps perceptions (percepts). 
Woodworth suggests that sensation is the first response, and perception 
the second. While the following mathematical proportion is not exact 
and must not be taken too literally, note its meaning——Sensation: per- 
ception :: reflex: instinct:: feeling: emotion. A rich perceptual exper- 
jence is now recognized as being very important in education. 
References: Pillsbury, ch. 7;.Norsworthy and Whitley, ch. 7; Col- 
yin, ch. 6; Woodworth, ch. 17; Warren, ch. 7; Angell, ch. 6 ; Strong, ch. 
1. What is apparently sensation and what perception in the following 
experiences: seeing a horse, hearing an automobile, tasting an 
orange? How many and what sensations might have gone together 
or have fused to give you your present percept of apple? What else 
enters in? Can you judge from these questions how a full- fledged 
mature percept is probably formed, so that you habitually recognize 
an object when it is presented to your attention? 
2. Errors in perception are commonly known as illusions. Note what 
is the cause of the illusion in the illustrations below: 
i. Proofreaders’ illusion—Pcyshology, if read rapidly in a sen- 
tence, would probably be read. psychology. Why? Did you so 
read ij 
ii. Artistotle’s illusion—Cross two fingers, placing a marble or 
pencil between them, so that it touches what otherwise would be 
opposite sides of the ‘Angers. How many objects do you feel? 
iii. Muller-Lyer illusion—Consult some text (e. g. Pillsbury). 
iv. Try to explain other illusions, e. g. hearing a burglar when 
alone, seeing a ghost, thinking the wrong train is moving, etc. 
vy. Do illusions enter into reading, spelling, ete? Illustrate. 
8. Reading, one of the most important school exercises if not the most 
important, involves perception very largely (see Pillsbury, pp. 192- 
5). Watch the eyes of some on reading the lines of this page and 
record the number of fixations made per line. Pillsbury notes three 
kinds of reading, by letter, by word, and by idea; be able to discuss 
these and note their use and relative importance. Is there a general 
law of perception applicable to each type of reading? Suggest other 
activities similar to reading in having such a hierarchy of perceptual 
habits. 
4, In concluding this study of sense-perception it would be well to 
write out an outline or a brief summary of the whole discussion. Add 
some statement of the importance of perception in the newer educa- 
cational practice, e. g. in teaching arithmetic, history, language, etc. 
or state three or four of the most important rules to guide the stu- 
dent and teacher in the use of concrete materials in education.

CHAPTER VI. IMAGINATION, MEMORY, ASSOCIATION 
‘Lesson 20. Imagery and Imagination 
As we turn from sensation. and perception to imagination we are 
turnihg from a study of present experiences to past (or possible fu- 
ture)’ experiences. Impressions made upon the mind by the outside 
world remain in consciousness as images; they affect our behavior 
markedly even after the experience is long past. The “consciousness” 
psychologist is inclined to class images with sensations and feelings as 
making up: the elements of all other higher mental processes. We are 
coneérned with getting a clear idea of these processes and their signifi- 
cance for memory and thought in particular. Images are the stuff out of 
which dreams and hallucinations are made largely. This is a very 
interésting by-path that some one may want to follow. 
‘References: Strayer and Norsworthy, ch. 6; Colvin and Bagley, ch. 
13; James, ch. 19; Colvin, chs. 7, 8; Norsworthy and Whitley, ch. 9; 
Angéll, pp. 196-206; 214ff; Woodworth, ch. 19; Warren, ch. 8; Pills- 
bury; ch. 4, pp. 236-8. 
1. ‘Write out to hand in under the title, “My Mental Imagery,” the an- 
-swers to the questions following under A, B, and C in sufficient de- 
“tail that one can get a good picture of your mental imagery: 
A. Visual Imagery 
Think of your breakfast or dinner table, as you sat down to it; 
veall up the appearance of the table, the dishes, the food on it, the 
‘persons present, etc. Then answer these questions: 
(1). Are the outlines of the objects distinct and sharp? 
(2). Are the colors bright and natural? 
(3). Where does the image seem to be situated? In the head? Be- 
fore the eyes? At a distance? 
(4). How does the size of the image compare with the actual size 
of the scene? . 
B. Kinds of Imagery 
(5). Can you call to mind better, the face or voice of a friend? 
(6). When “violin” is suggested, do you first think of the appear- 
ance of the instrument or sounds made when played? 
(7). Can you call to mind clearly the following and, if so, name 
the kind of imagery: (a) sight of natural scenery, (b) sound 
of music, (c) taste of fruit, (d) movement of a boat or ham- 
mock or swing, (e) ‘odor of a rose, (f) strain of lifting some 
heavy object? 
(8). What kinds of images, concrete or verbal, i. e. of things or 
words, are suggested to your mind by the words, (a) dog, 
(b) railroad, (c) write, (d) pull, (e) storm, (f) infinity? 
Conclusions 
Write out a brief’ summary of the kind of images you seem to 
have. Are they largely visual or largely of some other kind? Do you 
seem to be strong in imagery or not? 
2. What is an image? cf. to percept? What is imagination? 
8. Distinguish between concrete and verbal imagery. What type is the 
little child more apt to have? The uneducated adult? The scien- 
tist? ,Are some studies likely to call for one type and others the 
other? 
4, Imagery is usually classed as reproductive and productive (or 
creative).. Is the work of the inventor likely to demand one more than the other? Of the teacher? Of the young student? Of the 
advanced and older studént in a subject? What bearing has pro- ductive imagination on the world’s progress? 
5. What are the general traits of the imagination of the little child? What is the import of these for teacher and parent? Should the child’s imagination be developed? What of the use of “fairy tales”? 6. What definite educational principles have you discovered or thought out in this lesson, e. g. regarding the use of imagery in study ?

Lesson 21. Memory and Its Different Phases 
Memories or memory processes are very closely allied to imagery 
and imagination. We probably remember largely in terms of images 
whether we are aware of it or not, that is, images are the materials out 
of which memories ‘are made. It is doubtful if many topics are more 
fruitfulor practical to the student than this; therefore, for the sake of 
your future success as a teacher, in instructing others to use correct 
habits of memorizing, but also for your own economy of time and your 
own efficiency, you will do well to study this and the three succeeding 
chapters with unusual care and thoughtfulness. 
° References: Woodworth, ch. 14; Strong, chs. 11, 13, 17; Pillsbury, . 
ch. 8; Warren, ch. 8; Angell, ch. 9; Pyle, ch. 7; Norsworthy and Whit- 
ley, ch. 8; in each case study parts related to the questions. 
1. Would you say that you have a good memory or a poor memory? 
How. does it compare with some one’s else, that is do you know 
some fellow student who seems to have a much better memory? Can 
you:account for this? You will want to study two matters in this 
and succeeding lessons, (a) the complexity of the memory process 
(so that your memory may be good in one line and poor in another), 
and (b) the problem in what ways you can and cannot improve your 
memory. . : 
2. Reviewing your study of imagination, which type of imagination 
would you say is practically identical with memory? How, in 
general, does memory differ from imagination? From sense-per- 
ception? Illustrate your answers by concrete experiences as far as 
possible. State what the term designates. 
8. The psychologist finds four overlapping but different processes in- 
volved in memory; learning (or memorizing), retention, recall, and 
recognition. Familiarize yourself with the meaning of these terms 
and find an out-of-school and an in-school experience, each illustrat- 
ing these four phases. Note also how sometimes you have the ex- 
perience of one of the processes failing to function when others do, 
for example, recognition without recall. 
4. Is forgetting natural? Is it entirely disadvantageous? Why? What 
have psychologists found out about the rate of forgetting ? Does this 
agree with your experience? (This is the first time that you have 
come upon the use of graphing in psychology but you will want to 
use this from time to time in the future. Try, therefore. to under- 
stand what the curve of forgetting means, and to be able to draw 
and explain it). 
5. The instructor will give a test with numbers, letters, nonsense 
syllables, or unrelated words to find out the individual differences 
and to measure the memory span of each member of the class during 
the class period. Find out what is meant by the term, something of its importance at least in diagnosing the probable school achieve- 
ment of children, and also find out something of the differences be- 
tween children and adults in this regard. “ Apply this principle of difference of child and adult to memory in general and note that the current popular view about children’s memories, as many popular 
views about psychological matters, is incorrect.

‘Lesson 22. Types or Kinds of ‘Memory 
In this lesson we shall pursue further the study of the nature of 
memory. It would be well to first clear up anyproblems or difficulties 
with the preceding. lesson as far as possible. “Fhe first exercise is in- 
. tended to be completed after you have done this. Many interesting 
problems raised here will be answered largely in:the study of the learn- 
ing process in the course in educational psychofogy when we shall con- 
nect up the general problems of psychology with learning, and when 
we shall more definitely keep in mind the bearing of psychology upon 
school work.

Fill in the incomplete statements below, first without help of any

how far you are correct.

at first and then 00sec later on, 
In the last lesson you learned something about the term memory 
span and you also found your own span in relation to that’ of the 
class and of adults and children in general. This type of memory is 
known as primary (immediate) memory. What is the psychologist’s 
explanation of primary memory? Would secondary memory or re- 
tention be illustrated by the fact that you might perhaps rétmember 
one or more of these combinations today? Is cramming related to 
primary memory? When is cramming not wholly an unmitigated 
evil, e. g. with the student, the teacher, the lawyer, the minister?   
  Distinguish between two other kinds of memory, namely, rete and 
logical memory. Which of these is natural to the child and distaste- 
ful to the average adult? Why? Which’requires forming new 
bonds and which uses old bonds? Which, therefore, is more econom- 
ical 2. 
The instructor will give a brief test in logical memory and the re- 
sults can be measured alongside those of the memory span which, 
while a test of primary memory, is likewise a test of rote memory. 
In other words, you will be able to tell something about your status 
in regard to having a good memory or a poor memory if you rank 
high in both, or low in both, or medium in both. You may rank high 
in one and low in the other. What would this mean? Should a 
teacher rank high preferably, in rote or logical memory? A mail 
elerk or carrier? A telephone operator? A salesman? . 
The instructor will also give a test to show what the factors are in 
associative memory. The experiment will prove very interesting 
and will give you an insight into the way you remember when you 
do remember, that is, what are the causes of retaining, recalling, and 
recognizing. (Test adapted from Strong, ch. 14).

Lesson 28. Association: the Laws (Factors) in Association 
: The term association was once regarded by psychologists as offer- 
ing the solution of most problems of psychology, and as being a funda- 
mental principle of mental life very much as is the law of gravitation 
in the physical world. Today we are inclined to look upon association 
as being a phase ofall consciousness (or behavior) very much as is 
attention, and of its relationship as being closer to imagination and 
memory than to other mental processes. The newer view also considers 
the term as a practical equivalent of the term bond so that today we 
are really raising the question that is phrased by Strong, as follows: 
“What are the factors that affect the strength of the bond?” Bonds, 
connections, and associations, there must be, or situations would not 
call out the same or similar responses. One can scarcely imagine what 
sort of mental life if any, we could have under those circumstances.

157; phorndike, E. P., pp. 238-258; Angell, pp. 206-214; Woodworth, 
ch. 15, 
1. If I suggest to you the word “apple,” and you immediately think of 
or associate with it the word “‘tree,” you no doubt do so because you 
have associated them together some time in the past. Otherwise, 
some other response would have been made. Note similarly the re- 
sponse called up by “2 times 2,” “the capital of Virginia,” “discov- 
ery of America,” or “289R.” Take the following words and write 
down the first 10 words or ideas (associations) that come successive- 
ly to mind: horse, storm, synapse, fruit. Can you account for these 
situations? (See exercise 3 below). Do you note a very real differ- 
ence in certain lists as compared with others? What is free asso- 
ciation? Controlled association ? 
2. What then, is association? How does the term differ in meaning 
from the term bond? Do associations exist in rote learning or mem- 
ory as well as in logical? Look back to your list of situations and 
responses in Lesson 5, and note the associations that account for 
the responses in a number of cases. 
8. Returning to the experiment in exercise 5, lesson 22, study carefully 
each of the responses, noting the factor that caused your answer to 
be correct or incorrect. Familiarize yourself with Strong’s discus- 
sion and try to bring to class at least one good illustration of each of 
these factors out of your recent experience. 
4, Which of these factors are of great importance in the work of the 
school? Which are of second-rate importance, and which of very 
doubtful value? Which are greatly neglected in current . school 
practice? Which should you heed very much more than you have 
been doing for the improvenient of results and economy of time in 
_ your study? 
5. Write and bring to class not more than a page of this note-book 
paper (nor less than a half page) of untechnical discussion of the 
terms, imagination, memory and association, to show that you have 
a clear notion of these concepts and their relatedness. 
6. What may be said to be the general law of association (see indexes 
of various texts or Thorndike, E. P., p. 207) ; cf. the notion of apper- 
ception? This may also be considered as the general law of habit forming, which is a related topic that can be discussed here or left 
to the course in educational psychology.

Lesson 24. Review of Memory and Association: Practical Applications 
This lesson, like the last question of the previous lesson, aims to 
assist you in summing up and clinching the main ideas of the last four 
lessons. It also aims to help you to fix certain very practical maxims of 
memorizing. It is probable that the instructor will want to supplement 
this to act as a means to a review of the work beginning with lesson 14. 
The practical problem for you as a student is whether you make sure 
that your habits of memorizing are overhauled as a result of this study. 
References: Colvin, ch. 11; Strayer and Norsworthy, ch. 5; Pills- 
bury, ch. 8; Freeman, pp. 193-204. See also lessons 20, 21, 23. . 
1. Learn what you can about the experimental findings of psychologists 
regarding the effects of sex and age upon memory. Would the law 
of variation sometimes outweigh the factor of sex? At what age 
are children likely to enjoy verbatim memory work? Why? 
2. You have found the question of a “good memory” resolving itself 
into the matter of (a) natural retentiveness which probably cannot 
be affected by education any more than the color of one’s eyes, and 
(b) improved methods or habits of memorizing. What have been 
found to be the secrets of this improvement? (See Strayer and 
Norsworthy) Cf. also exercise 5 below. 
3. What are the advantages or values in memory systems which you 
frequently see advertised in the magazines? Of mnemonic or me- 
chanical methods of memorizing? Illustrate. What pitfalls lie 
in both? And what is after all the best single system? 
4, Going back over the last four lessons, make a list of four or five 
definite facts that have been rather well established by scientific in- vestigation in the field of memory. This is a field in which much 
work has been done that really bears upon formal or informal edu- 
cation. Couch your statements briefly and see if they do not stand 
as laws of memory. (Cf. lesson 15, exercise 2). 
5. If you were to be given the task of learning a poem of twenty lines 
or a prose selection of similar length, what are the most valuable 
rules and maxims that you could use to make your memorizing effec- 
tive? You may be able to build these rules in a better order, per- haps around some such cue-words as the following : meaning, recita- 
tion, repetition, distribution, wholes, association, threshold. What 
others should be added? Which of these rules would not hold as well of learning history, mathematics, spelling, home economics, or 
psychology? Which do you need to bear in mind to make your work more efficient?

CHAPTER VII REASONING AND THE PROCESSES INVOLVED |. 
: IN REASONING 
Lesson 25. General Nature of Reasoning (Thinking) 
Someone has said, “Animals never reason and man seldom.’’ How- 
ever, simpler forms of thinking and the exercise of the various mental 
processes involved in thinking are of frequent occurrence, even if the 
more elaborate problem-solving is largely left to a: few individuals. 
You will find this and the succeeding chapter harder than usual 
unless you check up your readings carefully with your own experiences 
as you have been asked always to do. There has comparatively little 
been done in experimenting with the reasoning process as compared 
with memory and, therefore, introspection is the more important. The 
best book on the subject and one that you will want some time to have 
a mastery of, is Dewey’s “How We Think ;” this book is largely an ana- 
lytic study rather than experimental, but it has influenced all later 
writers on psychology and education decidedly and if you were to 
master this one book you would have a splendid background for mas- 
terful teaching. 
References: Strayer and Norsworthy, ch. 7; Warren, ch. 13; 
Strong, chs. 38, 39; Woodworth, ch. 18; Angell, 10, 11; Norsworthy 
and Whitley, ch. 10; Pillsbury, ch. 9; James, ch. 22; Freeman, ch. 11; 
Colvin, chs. 20-22. Dewey’s “How We Think” is referred to in connec- 
tion with some of the exercises. See also Miller, “The Psychology of 
Thinking,” and Boraas, ‘Teaching to Think.” : 
1. What are some of the different meanings that people give the term 
thinking? Are some of them incorrect? Does it seem to bear a 
close relation to association? What is the distinct characteristic, if 
any, in reasoning? When and why do humans reason? Do animals 
reason? Why are such responses relatively infrequent in our 
mental life? 
2. Study the illustrations of thinking (reasoning) in Dewey’s H. W. T. 
(pp. 68-72), tracing out the steps in his illustrations. Then write 
out to hand in, some fairly recent experience of your own in think- 
ing, noting in the write-up the steps of Dewey: Could one of these 
steps he slighted or omitted in some bits of reasoning and the con- 
clusions be valid? What is meant by “reasoning a thing through ?” 
Do we often stop short of the end? What is meant by the statement 
that “it takes time to think”? Is this principle frequently violated 
by teachers ? 
8. How can inductive and deductive thinking be distinguished ? Which 
is the more natural with children? Which with an adult who is 
thnking regarding familiar lines of experience, e. g. his vocation? 
Do both of these types take place in your illustration above? Cf. 
grammar, nature study, home economics, algebra, history, this 
course in psychology? Can you in each case suggest how a better 
or different organization of the course would require more variety of 
use of these two types? Or a change in emphasis from one to the 
other? 
4. Before you leave this matter, write out a brief summary of this dis- cussion in which is included: thinking, reasoning, the steps, induc- 
tion and deduction. Are you yourself addicted too much to the habit of accepting the conclusions of others as your own, without thinking them out, or without, when possible, arriving at these con- 
clusions yourself?

Lesson 26. Processes Involved in Reasoning: Practical Applications - 
Just as emotions are inconceivable without feeling and percepts 
without sensations, so reasoning must be thought of a complex of many 
processes including concepts, judgment and inferences. It becomes the 
whole business of logic, a sister science of psychology, to deal with the 
results of reasoning, the statements and arguments such as we find in 
texts and other books, dnd to establish norms by which to judge the 
correctness and validity of such argumignts. In this lesson we are to 
see on the other hand, how these various processes dovetail into one 
another and to draw therefrom a list of valuable suggestions for our 
own thinking and for our training of others to think. 
References: See lesson 25, 
1. When you think of, have an idea of, say a “horse” or horses in 
general, without at the. time any sengory experience (percept), this 
generalized experience or process is known as a concept, or mean- 
ing. You will remember that a sensation became a percept when 
some meaning was attached to the object, so now the concept repre- 
sents this meaning come so fully into’its own, that it can replace the 
object itself in our thinking. Does this concept of horse carry with 
it an image of some one horse or horse-ness in general? Is it neces- 
sary for it to do so? Briefly, what is a concept and the process of . 
conception? Note how this process. is a tremendous time-saving 
device which probably animals have in a very small degree and that 
our concepts not only grow in experience (ripen and develop), 
but also in the rate’s experience? Illustrate. , 
2. Not only does reasoning require concepts (meaning, facts) as the 
raw material but it draws conclusions, arrives at solutions or makes 
inferences. Already in exercise 3, lesson 25, we noted the double 
process of inference. Could we say: that inferring is the response 
of interpreting the relation of concepts? (See Dewey, pp. 82-83, 
and Woodworth, pp. 465-8, 474-5). Is the process of inference es- 
sential for the development of clear workable concepts? That is, 
do the two kinds of responses go hand in hand? Illustrate. Show 
how in this course you have been, by means of the exercises and 
problems, engaged not in elaborate problem-solving but rather in 
developing concepts and making inferences. How does typical text- 
book study utilize these responses? In a somewhat different de- 
gree or with a different emphasis? 
3. Do not memorize the following general maxims about thinking in 
. relation to school work, but think them over carefully, try to illus- 
trate them, and to apply them to your own work as a student (cf. 
Colvin, ch. 22; Strayer and Norsworthy, ch. 7). 
_ i. Abtract thought (reasoning) is a capacity that is possessed 
in varying degrees and in some persons to a very small degree. 
__ ii, Reasoning demands data sufficient to solve the problem 
- (if the pupil does not possess the facts, they must be gotten from 
texts, from the teacher, from observation or other legitimate 
sources). : . 
_ iii. Reasoning and the rational life require as attitudes, open- : mindedness, self-criticism, and originality. 
; vi. Training is essential at each step in the thinking process 
in defining the problem, in analyzing it into its different elements, in evaluating the tentative solutions, and in verifying the accepted 
wer.

CHAPTER VIII. WILL AND CHARACTER 
Lesson 27. Will, Voluntary Action, Character, Moral Training 
There was a time when psychologists had a conception very much 
like the popular one of today that the will was a separate faculty of the 
mind which acted as a sort of commanding general of the other faculties 
or processes. Today we conceive willing or volition as being a counter- 
part of attention and characterizing our mental life when action fol- 
lows along the lines of our choices, ideas, ideals, and intentions. 
' Our character or moral life is a complex of these ideals and habits that 
we more or less consciously develop. It is therefore exceedingly im- 
portant for your personal happiness and influence to get the proper no- 
tion of will and its training.

1. Some of our acts are planned more or less and others not. What is 
the actual difference? Has this anything to do with will? Look up 
the hypothetical experience in Lesson 3 and note the place of willing 
there. What willed or voluntary action has characterized your be- 
havior today? What do you understand by the psychologist’s state- 
ment that the will is “the whole mind active?” (Angell, p. 435). 
Try to state as simply as possible what you regard as the meaning 
of the term will or volition. 
2. Note the meaning of the following terms: desire, choice, wish, decis- 
ion, conflict, intention, determination, effort. Can you suggest other 
terms that have to do with willing? Could you arrange these in a 
series ? 
3. It has been stated that “What holds attention determines action” 
(James, p. 448). Illustrate this. Does this hold of the so-called in- 
attentive child in school? Does emotion enter in to determine will 
or choice? Does habit? Try to take some experience where you 
have made an important decision and note the presence of these 
three factors and others that may be present. Is.will more char- 
acterized by suppressing or by expressing one’s self? Does your 
answer agree with the popular notion? : 
4. What is meant by character? In how far is it a question of habits 
and ideals? What does it mean to have an impulsive will? an 
obstructed will? a healthy will? i. e. while these phrases are now un- acceptable, what is the idea behind each and how does it connect 
with character? . 
5. What is will training? Which is more likely to further character 
training or development of the will, (a) moral instruction in what 
constitutes good citizenship or (b) participation in student govern- 
ment? Why? What is the weakness of moral instruction that is, teaching precepts, or “preaching” in school? Would you rule it out? Why is the teacher’s example followed and her precepts 
ignored ? : 
6. Bearing in mind that the modern view is that the little child when he comes to school is largely non-moral, what suggestions have you to make to show that Dewey is right in saying that there are three sources of moral education or moral development in the school, the studies (curriculum), the methods used by the teacher, and ‘the school life itself? What are three or four of the most important rules or maxims for the teacher to hold in mind as summing up the practical aspects of will training or moral education? Or what are the general notions you need to bear in mind if you wish to develop strength of character?

CHAPTER IX. GENERAL PROBLEMS: RELATEDNESS OF FUNC- 
TIONS, SELF, MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
Lesson 28. Interrelations of Mental Functions: Personality, Self 
You will recall that at the beginning of the course you were told 
that there was an older and false view of mind, namely that it was com- 
posed of a few rigid and separate faculties. On the other hand we now 
conceive it to be in reality a unit, despite the millions of responses that 
we perhaps daily make, like a great machine in respect to behavior but . 
frequéntly and usually conscious of its behavior. While therefore we 
continue to use much the same terminology as the older view, e. g., 
memory, emotion, and so forth, we do this to help in analyzing this com- - 
plex mechanism and to indicate how at one time it focusses in one way 
and at another time in another way. Oftentimes the labels do not fit 
well and could be shifted about without much difficulty. Reasoning is 
like will (involving deliberation), like memory (depending upon re- 
eall), like imagination (using images ordinarily), like association of 
ideas (and almost identical in its simpler forms), and is indeed based 
similarly upon heredity or natural tendencies. Today we want to think 
a little while about this general relationship of mental functions or pro- 
cesses and of its bearing upon two interesting problems: (1) the trans- 
fer of training from one function to another (exercise 2), and (2) 
the meaning of the terms self and personality (exercise 3). 
References: Pillsbury, ch. 15, 17; Colvin, pp. 241-6; Strayer and 
Norsworthy, ch. 12; Woodworth, ch. 21. 
1. Show, as with reasoning above, how perception connects up with 
most of the various processes or functions discussed in preceding les- 
sons. Does this interrelation seem to hold of attitudes and emo- 
tions? Pillsbury maintains that there are three general functions of 
mind, which you have noted in connection with your study of situa- 
tions, bonds and responses: receiving impressions, retaining impres- 
sions, and selecting among these. Are these three in evidence when 
I perceive a falling star, decide to walk instead of ride, remember 
the face of a friend in a crowd, etc.? Can you make other analogies 
than the one in the introduction which suggest the unitary nature 
of mind? Does this idea of interrelationship really clear up mat- 
ters for you compared with your notions before studying psychol- 
ogy? Why is it important for the teacher? 
2. If functions are so definitely and closely interrelated,.when and why, 
if. at all, does training carry over from one to another, e. g., mem- 
orizing poetry and prose, being accurate in arithmetic and writing 
and keeping accounts and in one’s statements about other people? 
Be careful to get the correct view of this matter if you cannot answer 
the above questions with certainty. Can general intelligence be 
trained by training one function? Can it be trained at all? Be 
able to state how transfer of training takes place according to re- 
cent studies of the problem. 
3. Another problem which arises naturally is that of the nature of per- 
sonality or self. Just as reasoning is the basis of study of logic so 
the study of the self and the not-self is of philosophy. We are con- 
cerned only with getting a general and practical working notion of these terms. Try to describe some one’s personality so that another will recognize the person. Do you find yourself using the terms 
that you have grown familiar with in this course, or other terms? What is personality? How does the idea differ from that of self? Do you have a concept of self (your self )very much as you have _of tree or chair? Is it the result of “thinking together” your var- ious experiences? (If you care to read about the self, see Pillsbury, ch. Hf j Angell, ch. 28; James, ch. 12; Woodworth, ch. 21; Warren, ch. .

       Q ‘Lesson 29. Mental. Development: Different Stages of 
’ Although there has not seemed opportunity or time to stress it, you 
shave noticed from time to. time: references to the fact that mental de- 
velopment is a.process that begins largely with birth and is never ended 
until death or at least until senility comes on. A new-born babe can 
see, at least it can distinguish light from dark, but it cannot reason; it 
has sensations but no percepts or concepts. Professor James has said 
that its experience must be that of a “big, blooming, buzzing con- 
fusion.” However all these traits or functions we have been discussing 
begin to develop early, not appearing full-fledged at one time as many 
people seem to think. . 
Our school work is divided more or less along the lines of child 
development into primary, intermediate and high school phases. At 
this time it is well for you to stop and check up on the traits of chil- 
dren at these ages. The instructor will assist you and perhaps arrange 
one or more observations. He may want you to specialize upon one of 
these three. phases or stages or to study each less thoroughly. 
References: Norsworthy and Whitley, ch. 15; Camerson, ch. 15; 
Freeman, ch. 12; Bagley, Educative Process, ch. 12; for the high school 
period or adolescent period, consult Colvin, Introduction to High School 
Teaching, ch. 2 or Monroe, Principles of Secondary Education, ch. 7, or 
Averill, ch. 45. Kirkpatrick, in his Individual in the Making, has the 
most detailed account of, the different stages of child development, if 
one will read it with care and remember that what is reported is large- 
ly a jnatier of careful observations with a single child or a small number 
of children. 
1. There seems to be much evidence that general bodily development 
and mental development go hand in hand, e. g., note the changes 
that occur at puberty. Can you cite other illustrations of this fact? 
It is likely that if a child is retarded physically he will in the major- 
ity of cases be retarded mentally? In any study of children at dif- 
_ ferent ages or stages, which would be more desirable to know, the 
chronological age (that is, his age in years and months) or his men- 
tal age (representing his actual mental development) ? How would 
the latter be found? 
2. Bagley calls the period from 6-8 the transition period, that from 
8-12 the formative period, and that from 12-16 the adolescent per- 
iod. Try to suggest other terms or to point out the traits prominent 
in these periods. Then follow up one or more periods with a care- 
ful study, centering a part or most of your thought in the follow- 
~ ing questions: 
i, What are some of the better defined objectives (aims) of 
school work at this period? 
ii. What are some of the most important instincts that are 
prominent at this period? 
iii. What types of interest absorb the child’s mind, vocational, 
scientific, social, play, ete? 
. iv. What are some of the characteristics of his perception, 
imagination, reasoning, memory, attention, etc? 
_ v. What do you consider as some of the biggest problems of 
this period? If you are able to do so, observe one child carefully 
and write out a summary of your observations more or less along the 
line of the questions above.

TRANSLATOR’S NOTE. 
Or the many educational institutions in Germany, 
four are mentioned in the following pages: the 
Gymnasium, or classical school ; the Realschule, and 
the Oberrealschule. The two latter correspond to 
our “ modern school,” and give a modern education, 
teaching no Latin or Greek. The Realgymnasium 
is a compromise between these two types, and gives 
a modern education, while at the same time teaching 
Latin. All are organized upon the basis of a nine 
years’ course, and the forms or classes are arranged 
as follows, beginning with the lowest :

INTRODUCTION 
Dr. JAEGER’S book will be useful to English teachers 
for many reasons. It supplies a picture of the 
ordinary method of teaching history in Prussian 
schools, both classical and modern. It explains 
the aims which that teaching is meant to attain, the 
reasons which dictate the choice of particular his- 
torical periods, and determine the order in which 
those periods shall be studied, and the relation of 
history to other studies forming part of the course. 
Without entering too much into detail, it gives a 
sufficient number of examples and particulars to 
make the general principles upon which the course 
is based perfectly clear, and to show how it works in 
practice. 
The practical object with which the book is 
written increases its value. Its aim is limited. 
Dr. Jaeger does not wish to set forth a better 
system of teaching history, but to explain one which 
actually exists. Now and then he criticizes it or 
suggests some modification ; he is somewhat con- 
servative, and inclined to think that recent changes 
have not been altogether improvements. But he

remains throughout a schoolmaster writing for 
other schoolmasters, in order to show them, by the 
light of his own experience, how to make the best 
of the system they have to work. Having had 
fifty years’ experience, he is able to understand all 
the difficulties which a teacher encounters in the 
attempt to carry out one of these comprehensive 
schemes of historical instruction, and knows how 
they can best be overcome. The scheme itself is 
one which deserves careful consideration, for the 
curriculum of the Prussian secondary schools was 
carefully planned to begin with, and carefully 
revised at intervals by the light of expert criticism. 
It represents a gradual growth, and has stood the 
test of time. 
For these reasons it seemed desirable to publish 
a translation of Dr. Jaeger’s book. The problems 
which a teacher of history has to solve are the same 
in all countries, however much their educational 
systems differ. Therefore, although the organiza- 
tion of English schools, and the conditions under 
which history has to be taught in them, may differ 
very widely from those which exist in Germany, 
there is much to be learnt by English teachers from 
the study of the system of historical education 
which these pages set forth. The conditions are, 
indeed, very different. One great distinction be- 
tween German Gymnasien and English public schools 
is this. The German educational system pre- 
supposes a nine years’ course passed in one school ; 
the English system usually involves three or four
-P-A-G-E-11
INTRODUCTION xili 
years spent at a preparatory school, followed by 
five or six at a public school. It is plain that the 
carrying out of a systematic scheme of historical 
instruction, or instruction of any other kind, is far 
more easily effected under the conditions which 
prevail in Germany than it would be in England. 
For here, as we all know by the published reports 
of their discussions, there is no agreement between 
the headmasters of the public schools and the 
headmasters of the schools which prepare boys for 
them on the most fundamental questions relating 
to the curriculum. 
A second difference in organization is this. The 
existence of a fixed curriculum like the German one 
presupposes ‘and necessitates a certain fixity and 
unity in the constitution of each form. German 
boys remain in the same form for a year together, 
and then move up in a body to the next form. It 
is therefore possible to arrange that a boy shall 
go through a certain period of history one year and 
another period the next year, finishing one before 
he proceeds to the next. In an English public 
school, with terminal or half-yearly promotions of 
the top boys from one form to another, the com- 
position of a form is continually changing. This is 
a real obstacle to any consecutive course of historical 
study, though it may be partially overcome by 
various expedients. 
Another principle involved in the existence of a 
fixed curriculum is the assignment of a definite and 
an adequate amount of time to each particular
-P-A-G-E-12
  xiv INTRODUCTION 
subject. In the Prussian curriculum, for instance, 
two or three hours a week during the whole of a 
boy’s school life are devoted to history. For without 
a definite and an adequate allowance of time through- 
out no consecutive treatment of the subject would 
be possible, still less any scientific or scholarly 
teaching. In English public schools, however, the 
time allotted to the subject varies from school to 
school, and from form to form in the same school, 
according to the caprice of individual head masters. 
One head master may assign an adequate number of 
hours to history ; another may stop the study of 
history altogether for the classical side at a certain 
form in the school, and continue it only on the 
modern side, or in the army class ; a third, still less 
intelligent, may seek to banish it altogether to 
preparatory schools. 
All these eccentricities are still possible, although 
there has been in the last twenty years some improve- 
ment in the teaching of history in the public schools 
and in secondary schools in general. The German 
system postulates the existence of a central authority 
with definite ideas as to what boys should learn at 
school, and power to enforce the adoption of its 
ideas. That is the fundamental difference. In the 
case of English secondary education there is no such 
authority. Instead of it there are some dozens of 
authorities which seek to influence the teaching given 
in schools, and do it by prescribing examinations 
rather than by coming to some agreement as to the 
best ‘kind of curriculum for each particular type

INTRODUCTION XV 
of school. There are Government examinations 
such as those for the army and navy and the various 
branches of the Civil Service, and some of those 
conducted by the Board of Education. There are 
the Universities, old and new, with their entrance 
examinations—or preliminary examinations of much 
the same nature as entrance examinations — and 
with scholarship examinations established by various 
colleges, and intended to reward proficiency in 
various subjects. There are special boards set up 
by the Universities for the special benefit of schools, 
such as the Oxford and Cambridge “ Locals” and 
** Joint Board,” each with its different examination. 
Last of all come special examinations, such as those 
for solicitors or chartered accountants, and those of 
associations, such as the College of Preceptors. 
All these various examining authorities differ as 
to their requirements. There is no agreement 
amongst them on the question whether boys ought 
to learn history at school or not. It is a necessary 
subject in examinations for naval cadets and naval 
clerks, in the qualifying examination for the army, 
and in the matriculation examinations of the Scottish 
Universities, the Universities of Wales and of 
Birmingham, and the four new Northern Uni- 
versities. It is an optional subject in the schools 
examinations established by Oxford and Cambridge, 
and no knowledge of history is required for admis- 
sion to either of those ancient seats of learning. 
This uncertainty on a fundamental question pre- 
vents history from obtaining its proper place in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
xv INTRODUCTION | 
curriculum. As great an obstacle to the efficient 
teaching of the subject, where it is taught in schools, 
is the disagreement between these examining bodies 
as to the amount of history and the kind of history 
required. When it is a necessary subject candidates 
are usually required to pass in the Outlines of English 
History, or, as the Scottish Universities better define 
it, of British History. The Oxford and Cambridge 
schools examinations require portions of English his- 
tory, but disagree as to the length of the portions and 
as to the question where any particular period should 
begin or end. In their preliminary, junior, senior, 
and higher examinations, the historical demands of — 
the Oxford and Cambridge Locals disagree, and the 
examinations of the Oxford and Cambridge Joint 
Board introduce new disagreements and additional 
complexity. 
What are the results of this superabundance of 
examining authorities with their conflicting require- 
ments? One result is that the systematic and 
thorough teaching of history in schools is rendered 
impossible. Another is that advanced teaching of 
history in the Universities is rendered excessively 
difficult. Boys study a period or an epoch at school 
without properly learning the outlines of the political 
history of the British Empire. So out of half a dozen” 
men beginning to read for the Modern History School 
at Oxford or Cambridge, one knows the Tudors, 
another the Stuarts, a third the Hanoverian period, 
and others other scraps, but they have not all six | 
the common stock of sound elementary knowledge

which is the necessary basis for University teaching. 
Every college history tutor has to spend much of 
his time in teaching undergraduates elementary 
historical facts which they ought to have learnt at 
school. This is detrimental to the tutor himself, 
and lowers the standard of teaching at the Uni- 
versities. 
The existence of a school curriculum imposed by 
Government has various drawbacks, but they are 
less serious than those which arise from the absence 
of any generally-accepted scheme of studies, and 
from the pressure of discordant examinations. 
Whilst we criticize the rigidity of foreign systems, 
we sanctify the anarchy of our own by. baptizing 
it “ elasticity.” 
In such a condition of things all that English 
teachers of history can do—until secondary educa- 
tion in all its branches is taken in hand by our 
Government—is to imitate the example of American 
teachers of history. Finding the subject neglected | 
or badly taught in American schools, they proceeded 
by forming local and general associations, and by 
holding conferences, to arrive at some agreement 
amongst themselves as to the best methods of teach- 
ing, and the best kind of curriculum. Having reached 
a ‘substantial agreement’ on these points, they went 
on to attempt to influence the makers of school 
programmes and the authorities controlling entrance 
examinations to colleges and Universities. This 
movement, which began in 1891, has met with a 
considerable amount of success. “The progress 
b 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
    XViil INTRODUCTION 
that has been made during the last ten or fifteen 
years is encouraging,’ writes an American professor. 
‘“ Although history does not yet receive the recogni- 
tion which is due to so important a subject, its value 
is better understood, its objects are more clearly 
defined, the methods of teaching it are more fully 
developed. Some things remain to be done. At 
present in the elementary schools, and to a large 
extent in the secondary schools, the subject is 
assigned to teachers who know little about it, and 
who have never been adequately trained to teach it. 
A little study of history in college ‘is not enough, and 
even this is usually lacking. 'The remedy here can 
come only through the strengthening of the college 
work in history, and through more adequate courses 
of instruction in the normal schools. Quite as 
important as this is the realization on the part of the 
makers of programmes that we live not merely in 
the United States, but also in the world. Another 
decade should not pass before the work in history 
in the American schools is made as comprehensive, 
and is entrusted to as well-trained teachers, as is the 
case in France and in Germany.” * 
American teachers reached the “substantial 
agreement ”’ Professor Bourne speaks of not only by 
means of repeated discussions amongst themselves, 
but by means of careful inquiry into the systems of 
historical education pursued in various European 
states. Reports were drawn up on the teaching of

Elementary and Secondary School, p. 76 (Longmans, 1903).

  INTRODUCTION xix 
history in Germany, France, and other countries in 
order to supply the members of the American 
Historical Association with exact information as to 
what was actually done in foreign schools, and with 
the materials for forming a judgment as to what 
should be done in their own.* Amongst other 
things they inquired into historical education in 
English schools, and their report states that, “‘ owing 
to the well-known chaotic condition of English 
secondary education,” they are unhappily prevented 
from saying what, our system is. However, it is 
not this incidental criticism that concerns us just 
now, but the practical and scientific manner in 
which the American teachers set to work to solve 
their own problem. That is what we ought to 
imitate. Only by a similar process will it be 
possible for English teachers of history to arrive at 
sound conclusions, and to come to some consensus 
of opinion amongst themselves as to the best 
historical curriculum for English schools. Dr. 
Jaeger’s book has been translated as a contribution 
to this object—that is, in order to supply English 
teachers with facts which will help them to form a 
right judgment on questions of principle. The 
system described is not held up as a copy to be 
imitated, but as a solution of the question we have 
to solve which is worth studying and understanding. 
To make this understanding easier the translator,

as he explains in his prefatory note, has rendered 
the names of the forms in a German school, not by 
their literal meaning, but by their equivalents in 
English nomenclature. In the tabular statement of 
the historical curriculum of a Prussian gymnasien 
which follows, the same.method has been adopted, 
but the German names of the forms are given in 
brackets in order to facilitate comparison with other 
accounts of German education. A good description 
of the whole curriculum, of the various kinds of 
schools, and of the history and organization of 
secondary education in Germany will be found in

First Form (Sexta)—SEconp Form (Quinta) 
Age of boys from nine to eleven or eleven and a 
half. In both forms the work is not, in the strict 
sense of the word, history, but rather a preparation 
for it. It is regarded as part of the teaching of 
German. History is replaced by tales of the great 
men of ancient, medieval, or modern times, and by 
the legends of classical antiquity. In the first form 
four hours a week are devoted to these subjects ; in 
the second, three. In both forms two hours a week 
are devoted to geography.

  Xxil INTRODUCTION 
HIGHER STAGE 
Upper FirrH Form (Ober-sekunda) 
Ancient history to the fall of the Western Empire 
in.A.D. 476. Geography ceases to be an independent 
subject, though some geographical teaching is given 
in connexion with the history studied. Three hours 
a week is allotted to the joint subject. German 
literature and composition also obtain three hours a 
week, 
Lower SixtH Form (Unter-prima) 
European history from 476 to 1648. Geography 
in connexion with the history studied, as in the class 
below. Three hours a week for the joint subject. 
German literature and composition, three hours a 
week. 
Urprer SrxtH Form (Ober-prima) 
European history from 1648 to 1871, with the 
briefest sketch of events subsequent to 1871, three 
hours a week. Geography only so far as it is con- 
nected with the history studied. German literature 
and composition, three hours. 
In constructing this outline of the historical 
curriculum of the Prussian classical schools, it 
seemed unnecessary to add particulars as to that of 
the modern schools, which is essentially the same.
-P-A-G-E-21
    INTRODUCTION XXili 
But it seemed desirable to insert some particulars as 
to the two studies most closely related to history— 
viz., geography, and the national literature and 
language. Further details as to those two studies 
will be found in Dr. Jaeger’s pages. 
The principles underlying the curriculum are 
plainly apparent. In the first place, the study of 
history is carefully correlated with kindred studies 
so far as it seems possible. Very close correlation, 
as Dr. Jaeger points out, is not always either possible 
or desirable. History is comprehensively studied ; 
the course includes European history as well as 
ancient history and national history. It is con- 
secutively treated ; boys begin with ancient history, 
and proceed to modern history only after they have 
some acquaintance with the remoter past. In the 
study of national history the chronological order is 
strictly adhered to. Thus the sense of continuity 
and development, which is the essence of history, is 
preserved and fostered, instead of being destroyed as 
it is by our method of teaching shreds and patches 
of history. 
Another characteristic also needs noting. In the 
German curriculum there is what Dr. Jaeger terms 
‘*a twofold progress through the centuries,” or, as we 
should say, there are “two cycles.”’ In the inter- 
mediate stage boys go through the outlines of 
ancient and modern history from the time of the 
Greeks to the nineteenth century. In the higher 
stage they go over the same ground again, treating 
the national history no longer as a separate subject
-P-A-G-E-22
  
  xxiv INTRODUCTION 
but as part of European history. The arguments in 
favour of this plan are obvious. It recognizes the 
difference between the powers of the boys’ mind at 
different ages, and thus obviates the common — 
objection that adherence to the chronological order 
obliges boys to study the most difficult periods of 
history when they are least able to understand 
them. It allows a more thorough and a more 
scientific treatment of the subject during the higher 
stage, because a certain basis of elementary know- 
ledge has been assured. 
This particular characteristic appears not only in 
the Prussian, but in all other German schemes for 
the teaching of history in schools, and reappears, too, 
in the curriculum of French secondary schools. A 
principle on which there is so general a consensus of 
expert opinion should become an axiom with English 
teachers of history. Our object should be to adapt 
the results of European experience to English 
needs. At present in English historical education 
many things seem to be accepted as fixed principles 
which are merely local prejudices, or else traditional 
opinions which have never been rationally recon- 
sidered. Such, for instance, are the prevalent views 
that the teaching of epochs is more easy and profit- 
able than that of outlines, that European history is 
too difficult to be taught in schools, and that history 
is a subject which may usefully be studied in the 
lower forms, but can safely be omitted in the higher 
forms. | ,

THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
INTRODUCTORY 
Tue following pages do not claim to propose any 
reform or transformation of historical teaching in 
our German secondary schools and in kindred or 
parallel educational institutions ; still less do they 
attempt to base any pedagogic theory of the teaching 
of this subject upon psychological or educational 
considerations ; nor, again, do they claim to formu- 
late the true task and the ultimate object of his- 
torical teaching, as though these were yet unknown. 
So far as we can see, the teaching of history in our 
secondary schools requires no organic reform or 
modification of any radical kind, any more than 
has been necessary in our Prussian and German 
secondary school system. All that is required is 
prudent guidance, which can be gained by careful 
consideration and continued learning on the part 
of those entrusted with this instruction ; in simpler 
words the chief requirement.is..good_ teachers, 
recognized as such because they steadily improve 
their teaching powers, and not because they write 
or even read a great deal about the reform of the 
instruction entrusted to them. The author can

look back upon an experience of fifty years of his- 
torical teaching—an experience that has forced him 
to examine the subject from the most different 
points of view. He has read and heard many 
discussions upon the subject, and has _ himself 
written and spoken upon it. He does not, however, 
propose to quote from these sources,* but merely 
to expound what his own mistakes and investigations 
have taught him, docendo discens, in the last fifty 
years. He thus proposes to attack the problem in 
a more concrete manner than the majority of discus- 
sions upon it are able to do, and to consider upon 
what points the teacher’s attention should be 
directed who has to teach history at any stage within 
our German educational institutions, whether they 
contain nine, seven, or six forms, in this twentieth 
century. 
As we shall see, the problem is both simple and yet 
comprehensive. 
These institutions are divided into classical and 
modern schools—into schools with or without Latin, 
to use the popular expression. Hence it is obvious 
that in discussing history and its teaching we must 
direct our attention in the first place to the classical 
* The literature of the subject is to be found admirably 
complete in Schiller, Handbuch der praktischen Padagogik, 2, 
p- 535 ff. Mention must also be made of the Méthodologie de 
Venseignement moyen by a Belgian scholar,—Professor Collard, of 
the University of Louvain (Brussels, Maison d’Edition Alfred 
Castaigne, 1903) ; see p. 382 ff. (L’histoire). We can recommend 
the whole section; criticism from a foreigner’s point of view is

schools, for the reason that the training there given 
is primarily historical, and is based upon a close and 
continual study of the past as displayed in Greek 
and Roman literature and history. Only upon this 
basis is it possible to explain the true meaning of 
history and historical instruction for boys between 
the ages of nine and eighteen, and only so can we 
form a picture of that ideal which every scientific or 
intellectual pursuit of any kind must necessarily 
keep in view. Not until this ideal has been dis- 
covered can we discuss the objects and the means of 
history-teaching in the case of those schools which 
are primarily occupied with the facts of modern life, 
with modern languages, and modern science. 
This order has not been adopted from any idea 
that the classical are to be regarded as the more dis- 
tinguished schools. Classical and modern schools 
have been solemnly recognized in Prussia as 
“equivalent in value”; this they are and have 
been, in their respective styles and places. We do 
not, in fact, recognize any distinctions of rank 
between the different categories of schools, so that 
we need not emphasize the national importance of 
the fact that historical teaching in the modern schools 
should be properly conducted. Of girls’ schools we 
say nothing ; the question demands special investi- 
gation, for which we do not possess the requisite 
knowledge, though at the same time we would 
assert our conviction of the extreme importance of 
this subject. The modern Latin schools (Real- 
gymnasien) we class in general with the classical 
1—2
-P-A-G-E-26
  
4 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
schools, laying no special stress upon the difference 
of their curriculum from that of the true classical 
school; the history teacher will very easily be 
able to make those slight modifications demanded by 
the difference between the two organizations. More- 
over, it is impossible to speak with any certainty at 
this moment of these Prussian Realgymnasien, as 
changes are constantly made in their curriculum, 
and especially in those branches of study which we 
are forced to consider—for instance, Latin. 
If we attempt to explain the special nature of 
secondary classical education as briefly as possible, 
one fact is clear—that these institutions owe their 
special character to the fact that they are prepara- 
tory to the university. Their education is a prepara- 
tion for science in the truest and highest sense of the 
word, and science implies the discovery of truth, 
reality, and certainty within the subject under 
examination. Preparation for scientific work is 
thus itself science, the search for truth, and the pro- 
cess which the Greeks called divccodety is common 
both to a first and to a sixth form, Hence we shall 
be able to define the special character of classical 
school training as education for science by means of 
science. It is a development of the sense of truth 
in the highest meaning of the term, of the desire in 
every case to secure clarity, which is truth. To 
this idea belongs the further conception that the 
student should be accustomed to desire truth for its 
own sake, la lumiére pour la lumiére, and not for the 
sake of such profit as individuals, however numerous,
-P-A-G-E-27
INTRODUCTORY 5 
may derive from his discoveries. Part of this task 
is, therefore, a business extraordinarily difficult for 
anybody ; at involves the gradual training of the 
pupil to recognize the meaning of knowledge in its 
full and pure sense,) and to make him understand 
that knowledge is not the mere grasp of some facts 
worth knowing brought temporarily within the range 
of his ideas. Here, at all events, is a tangible and 
material difference between the classical and the 
modern school. The latter have obviously to 
develop this sense of truth as well, and have to 
communicate knowledge, but not knowledge in its 
highest and strictest sense ; they teach rather than 
study, and their special qualities are to be found in 
other directions. 
What, then, is historical science, and what is 
historical instruction? What does historical in- 
struction mean to boys of nine, twelve, or eighteen 
years of age ? 
By history we understand the discovery and 
“sada of the past, of what has happened in the 
‘world through human agency. The mass of these 
accomplished facts is increased every day by 
enormous additions, and is, therefore, too great 
to grasp or measure. We have, accordingly, to 
select the most important of these events per- 
formed by human agency, and the question arises, 
What point_of view determines our idea of im- 
portance ? (We conceive of importance from the 
standpoint of humanitarianism. History, and there- 
fore historical teaching starts with the supposition 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  6 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
that mankind is an ethical whole, and has its 
Divine task appointed by God, to realize by slow 
degrees and gradual progress its conception of man- 
kind and humanity. This is the true sense attaching 
to the term “ world history,” which is a,history of 
mankind considered as an ethical wate It it is 
objected that a petitio principti lies beneath this 
assertion, we admit the truth of the statement in a 
certain sense ; our supposition is a helief, and not 
demonstrable fact. If, however, it be argued that 
humanity in this sense does not as yet exist, 
one point, at least, is certain: so soon as any 
individual has conceived the idea ‘‘ that all men, 
past, present, and future, form an ethical whole,” 
humanity, in_our sense of the term, has come into 
existence. Freee our definition of that science 
with which the historical teacher will deal is to the 
effect that history is the history of humanity re- 
garded as an ethical whole, and even if the history 
teacher’s instruction is of the most elementary kind, 
he cannot afford to dispense with this definition. 
It must be present to his mind, and he cannot afford 
to forget that this idea of the genus humanum was 
first elaborated upon. Roman soil, and eventually 
found its truth, tiga by no means its realization, 
in Christianity. “The teacher need not, however, in 
accordance with the precepts of former “ methods,” 
explain these or any definitions of the kind at the 
outset of his teaching; there will be time enough 
for that in the sixth form, For only at this point, 
after the pupil has reached the goal of his long
-P-A-G-E-29
INTRODUCTORY 7 
career, is this definition no longer a mere collocation 
of words to him, but becomes an idea and a truth 
which he has to some extent experienced. 
When historical instruction is in question the 
saying of Goethe naturally recurs to memory, to 
the effect that thecbest part of history is the en- 
thusiasm which it arouses» This is very true, and 
such enthusiasm is the best—not the sole—result of 
historical teaching, but it can only be aroused in 
connexion with the idea or the conception that the 
deeds which are to inspire admiration, the exploits 
of great and pure heroism, actually came to pass 
and were performed by men of like passions with 
ourselves.\ Hence we reach the supreme law which 
must govern every mode of historical presentation, 
and, therefore, of historical teaching in secondary 
schools. his instruction must deal only with what 
has actually happened, and it must be added, 
should represent it exactly as it happened, as far as 
it is possible to achieve this object. There is an 
ideal of historical narration based upon an entirely 
objective method which relates facts, describes 
character, and retraces motives undisturbed by 
personal inclinations, by political and_ religious 
partisanship, or by any other influences of the kind 
which may affect the historian. Admirable as this 
ideal may be, its perfect realization is an impossi- 
bility. The historian or narrator remains an indi- 
vidual, and his view of history, together with his 
mode of presentation, must ever bear a strong 
impress of his individuality. At this point, how-
-P-A-G-E-30
     
   8 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
ever, we are confronted by a further rule, which is 
by no means superfluous. Events that certainly 
have not happened, and have been proved by serious _ 
and honest investigation not to have happened, are 
not to be represented as realities for the purpose of 
producing some mora! or esthetic influence or other 
effect of the kind. Among our great historians 
Chr. Schlosser has expressly refused to accept 
the objective theory. Ranke, again, says of him- 
self with humble pride that he will only relate 
events “‘as they actually took place,” and has 
become, paradoxical as it may sound, an extremely 
subjective historian by reason of this very effort to 
reach an objective standpoint.* We cannot, there- 
fore, hold up either one or the other as a model for 
history teachers in secondary schools. 
The impossibility of writing history “‘ from the 
purely objective standpoint” is not merely a 
deficiency or disadvantage: it produces also a 
positive result. A contemporary historian is right— 
or, at any rate, has the right, whether he be an 
historical writer or teacher—to treat hisfory as a 
* We have in mind, for instance, the historical introductions 
to the narrative passages in the correspondence of Bunsen and 
Frederick William IV., edited by Ranke; these passages are 
apparently written from the objective standpoint as though 
the author were treating of the seventeenth or eighteenth 
centuries, but are in reality highly coloured with the writer’s 
personality. Of German historians Ludwig Hausser seems to 
us to be the best model for the teacher ; not only does he possess 
a full sense of historical justice and truth, but he has at the same 
time feeling and character. 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
INTRODUCTORY 9 
man of his own age—that is, from the standpoint of 
the twentieth century. He may also treat it as a 
member of his own nation, and many will be inclined 
to add, ‘“‘as a member of his own Church.” This 
latter claim raises a practical question of con- 
siderable difficulty of which we shall have to treat 
in its own place, for the special reason that discus- 
sions upon the question, whether at head-masters’ 
conferences or in educational hand-books, usually 
evade this point, and speak as if there had never been 
any difference between theories of life or any con- 
sequent great communities, churches and ecclesi- 
astical parties, which were founded upon a basis of 
these divergent views, have fought their battles, 
and are fighting them to-day. A powerful indi- 
viduality is a source of great power, and will make 
itself felt, if anywhere, in historical teaching ; but 
the teacher, even more than the historical writer, 
must remember that he is but an individual. He 
must, therefore, be careful to guard against the 
delivery of judgments by means of ready-made 
catch-words or oracular pronouncements. 
One further point must be mentioned before we 
can enter upon the practical and detailed side of 
our subject. (In the course of historical instruction 
the teacher is often obliged to consider the so-called 
spirit of the age, though this is often nothing more 
than a transitory whim of fashion>, At the present 
time, as every one knows, the teacher is confronted 
by “the consciousness of the age” or “the need 
of the present,” or by “life,” often with the loud

demand for special consideration of all possible 
economic and social developments. Nor is this all. 
very moment some new movement imperatively 
ands “consideration ’’ or “special treatment.” 
One would imagine that the spirit of advertisement 
or the eulogies of ‘the auctioneer had invaded our 
special sphere, remote as it may be from compe- 
tition and from the haggling of the market-place. 
The truth of the matter is that of making high- 
sounding phrases there is no end; to stimulate the 
feeling of patriotism, the sense of responsibility 
to the State, the religious sense and character in 
general—these are demands which the experienced 
teacher can estimate at their proper value, knowing, 
as he does, how humble a modicum of truth or 
reality is concealed behind these sonorous phrases. 
Hence at the very outset of our considerations we 
venture to offer the following advice to our younger 
colleagues : In the first place, decline to be frightened 
by uproar, or to be discouraged by lofty phrases. 
In the second place, continue to study history your- 
selves : learn it that you may teach it. The methods 
of historical study have been already learnt at the 
University, and the teacher has shown in his ex- 
amination that he has acquired this capacity. 
The art of teaching history to children, boys, or 
young men, will be learnt by practical teaching, 
the more certainly in proportion to the zeal and per- 
severance with which the teacher devotes himself 
to his special subject. One point, however, is an 
indispensable condition in whatever stage of his-
-P-A-G-E-33
  INTRODUCTORY 11 
torical teaching the instructor may find himself : 
he must have a general view of the whole path which 
his pupils have travelled, or have still to follow. 
This general view is assumed by us henceforward, 
and only so can we expect that our arguments will 
prove of any use to our colleagues. Our German 
secondary schools and the higher or middle schools 
corresponding to them, admit their pupils, generally 
speaking, at the age of nine or ten—in some cases 
a little earlier, in others a little later—and those 
who pass through the whole curriculum leave 
school at the age of eighteen, nineteen, or twenty. 
The secondary school and the modern school with 
its nine forms (Realschule), has, therefore, to deal 
with children, boys, and young men. Hence there 
is one fundamental law imperative upon historical 
instruction, if upon any branch of study: history 
is one thing to the mind of a child and of a boy, 
another thing to a youth, and, again, another thing 
to the mind of a mature or aged man. This fact 
has ever been recognized, and, as far as I can see, 
the curricula of all German educational institutions 
contemplate a twofold progress across the centuries. 
We have definitely rejected those simple or in- 
genious proposals which would divide the history 
of the world into so many portions as there are 
classes in a school, and assign a division to each class 
from the fourth form to the sixth. In examining 
the curricula of the German secondary and modern 
schools, we find a great and general similarity which 
materially facilitates our task. We shall, there-
-P-A-G-E-34
  12 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
fore, be justified in basing our arguments upon the 
organization usual in Prussia and in those provinces 
which have adopted it directly from Prussia. This 
method has been chosen not merely because this 
organization is best known to the author himself, but 
also because the conclusions drawn from these data 
are easily applicable to the other schools of our 
country.* In Prussia historical instruction has been 
discussed at numerous conferences of head masters, 
both in general and with reference to important 
details. The subject recurred some eleven times 
before the year 1876, when the well-known syllabus 
of Erler appeared. Discussion has been no less 
frequent since that date, and anyone who knows 
the extraordinary laboriousness of the methods by 
which these conferences work will not doubt their 
fundamental thoroughness. It may, further, be 
asked whether the result has justified the labour 
expended.t One point, however, which seems to 
us of high importance has not been sufficiently 
emphasized, either at these conferences or in the

Einrichtung und Verwaltung des hoheren Schulwesens in den

p- 119 (Baden), p. 195 (Hesse), p. 287 (Austria), p. 345 ff. (Hun- 
gary); the differences are not so profound as materially to 
modify our observations upon method and teaching practice. 
+ Beginners are rather to be dissuaded from a perusal of these 
lectures, which treat the subject in a hundred volumes of many 
thousand pages, and naturally repeat the same truths over and 
over again; the result is to give the beginner an entirely false 
idea of what has been or can be done in this subject.
-P-A-G-E-35

other literature of the subject. There is a general 
impression that our pupils learn history only 
during the so-called history hours ; yet nothing is 
more obvious than the fact that historical informa- 
tion and impressions may be derived by our pupils 
from many other sources ; consequently there can 
be no fruitful discussion of historical instruction 
until we have secured a clear view of these tributary 
streams of influence, if we may use the term, and 
their effect upon the main stream of historical 
teaching. It is not the actual handling of this 
subject, but rather its organization that is in ques- 
tion. The historical teacher will, therefore, find it 
advisable to consider at every stage the relationship 
of other branches of instruction to his own subject. 
This will lead him to a final preliminary question— 
a question, however, which cuts deep into the nature 
of the subject—At what class should historical 
instruction as such, in continuous and formal style, 
begin ? We know (apart from certain discoverers 
of the eleventh commandment) at what stage, more 
or less, the study of French, of Greek, or of English 
should begin. Can we say as much in the case of 
history ? 
In most German States the question is answered 
in practice as follows: historical teaching usually 
begins in the third school year—that is to say, in the 
Third* Form—according to the most usual termin- 
ology. The Prussian syllabus of 1892 and of 1901 
follows the same method, though for the First and 
* For terminology, see preliminary note.
-P-A-G-E-36
  14 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Third Forms history is put down at one hour a week 
(p. 45), subjects which are not historical being 
included under the term. We must admit that 
definition of the beginning of continuous historical 
instruction proper. ‘True historical teaching—using 
the word in the sense above explained—-cannot 
begin until some conception, however immature, has 
been secured of the difference between accomplished 
fact and fiction, until the stage has been reached 
when there is recognition that poetry, legend, and 
narrative are not the same as history. This point 
is neither automatically nor invariably reached by 
promotion from the Second to the Third Forms; 
but the process is generally completed between the 
ages of eleven and twelve and in that period of the 
school to which these ages belong. When we 
assert that “history ”—that is, the regular study 
of the subject—should not begin before the Third 
Form, we do not imply that the formation of an 
historical sense is impossible at an earlier period. 
We mark off the two lowest Forms—the First and 
Second—as a preliminary stage, in the belief that we 
shall thus secure a correct point of view for our 
future considerations. Hence our remarks apply 
primarily to the secondary or Latin school, though 
they are also true of any high school.
-P-A-G-E-37

FIRST AND SECOND Forms. 
For this stage of educational progress we refuse to 
admit historical instruction proper; at the same 
time the subjects of instruction are of extreme im- 
portance, as contributing to the formation of the 
historical sense and to the realization of historical 
truth. This process of development in the case of 
secondary school boys is chiefly influenced from 
three main sources : the instruction given in Latin, 
German, and religion. 
It is remarkable that the teaching of Latin has 
never been regarded from this point of view, and 
yet the fact is obvious so soon as it has been 
enounced. The first condition preliminary to the 
formation of an historical sense is the capacity to 
regard the past as present. A past national 
history, the life, the deeds, the possessions, and 
the modes of thought of a vanished people are 
transported into the present in the language of 
that people; hence every foreign language— 
especially every dead language—produces a cor- 
15

16 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
respondingly greater effect upon every human 
mind and upon the mind of every child. 
These influences produce effects far reaching, 
though not immediately obvious in tangible re- 
sult ; but appreciation of these. effects has been 
obscured by the current, but somewhat unin- 
telligible phrase that Latin is a mental gymnastic. 
The study of the language of a nation which is so 
infinitely far from us, and yet so infinitely near to 
us as Latin, can obviously do much more, even for 
a boy of nine years of age—as, indeed, the current 
phrase implies; and this, though we confine the 
deeper influence to the development of a capacity 
1or gathering isolated examples beneath the unity 
of laws and rules. It seems to us essentially im- 
portant to the very nature of our secondary educa- 
tion that no triviality should be imported into the 
study of this language ; all must be scientific, even 
for the immature mind of the First-Form boy, and 
this for the simple reason that every Latin word 
contains a wealth of historical life. This must be 
the method even in the earliest stages. Even if 
the phrase be nothing more recondite than mensa 
rotunda est, it should be shown that the people who 
spoke this language two thousand years ago had_ 
round tables, that they had Sessel (stools), sella, 
that they had Kuchen (cakes), placenta, etc., that 
its sons were addressed as mi fili. To the attentive 
observer it is absolutely certain that the greater 
interest which the boy shows in Latin as compared 
with a modern language, when he is capable of — 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
    PRELIMINARY STAGE 17 
interest at all, depends upon this fact. For the 
adult, again, it is by no means a matter of indiffer- 
‘ence whether he regards a beautiful jug in the 
nearest shop, from a famous factory, or a Roman 
drinking vessel, with some rude inscription, dug out 
of the ground. Two thousand years ago the 
drinking vessel was just as trivial as is now the 
beautiful jug which stands by the dozen in a shop 
window and is of interest to us for its esthetic 
beauty or its technical perfection; the drinking 
vessel has this advantage—that it has a history, 
that it speaks to us of the past, and enables us for 
a moment to realize this past. In the most in- 
sensible it arouses a feeling analogous to scientific * 
interest—the interest of curiosity, however tran- 
sitory ; and a similar effect is produced by a growing 
acquaintance with Latin forms, words, and termina- 
tions, and thereby with Latin things and ideas in 
the case of the boy of nine years old ; he feels him- 
self a Latin scholar because he thinks that he is 
gaining real and pure knowledge, and not merely 
the knowledge of the market-place. To make 
French or English—English in the case of the First 
Form—the initial foreign language in a secondary 
school, is to stifle the scientific sense at its very 
outset. At this point we may be confronted by 
one of those zealots who would build and concen- 
trate everything at once upon the basis of what is 
already known. He may ask how the teacher is to 
bring out and make operative the historical influence 
contained in the elements of Latin. The answer is 
2
-P-A-G-E-40
  18 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
that no special treatment is demanded of the 
teacher, and that he should merely allow this course 
of development quietly to proceed. It is quite open 
to him, and arises naturally from the subject, to 
tell his boys something from time to time of the 
great Roman nation whose language they are learn- 
ing, and of whom they will afterwards learn much 
more. We must not, however, be misunderstood 
to wish the importation of Greek and Roman his- 
torical facts into elementary Latin exercises—a 
process sometimes known as concentration, appar- 
ently on the principle of lucus a non lucendo ; within 
our own field many valuable fruits grow quietly, 
- without any fussing over questions of method. 
The second source which contributes to the for- 
mation of an historical sense is different in nature 
from the former, but acts as a valuable supplement 
to it; this is the instruction given in the German 
language, which can exert a fairly strong influence. 
The German reading-books of the two lowest forms, 
while providing poems of every kind, fables, fairy 
stories, anecdotes of men and animals, descriptions 
of Nature and proverbs, also deal, as is well known, 
with the facts of history. In our opinion the Prus- 
sian syllabuses of 1882, 1892, and 1901 were ill- 
advised in announcing “German and _ historical 
narratives, 3+1= 4 hours,” thus making one of these 
hours a special history lesson. Naturally our profes- 
sion has been at work here, and has already produced 
a whole library of books, with a biography of Hercules 
or Odysseus on the first page, and with that of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
    PRELIMINARY STAGE 19 
Emperor William I. or of the reigning Emperor on 
the last. 
We must enter a most decided protest against 
this literature and its sources, against “ history,” 
or special hours for its study, in First and Second 
Forms. Nor are these lessons as free from reproach 
as they appear in the otherwise admirable syllabus 
for the Saxon secondary schools of January 28, 1893. 
Whatever historical material can be used here, 
whether drawn from Greek, Roman, German, 
Saxon, or Prussian history, belongs to the German 
lesson and forms part of the German reading-book. 
It is quite reasonable that boys of nine or ten, who 
are learning Latin, and are introduced to our 
German national literature by the simple method of 
learning through the reading-book, should read of 
Charles the Great, of Henry I., of Frederick Bar- 
barossa, of King Frederick William III., and the 
Emperor William !., of Joseph IT., of Maria Theresa, 
of Frederick IT., of the heroes of Germany, or their 
own particular part of Germany, or even of their own 
limited district or their town. Even better is it when 
some gifted teacher, though he may possess no higher 
certificate, seizes the moment when no governor nor 
director is to be found for miles around, and tells 
his first-form pupils stories of these men and women. 
This, however, is not historical teaching, for the 
simple reason that pupils in this stage have secured 
no conception of chronological order. It would be 
useless to tell them that Frederick the Great reigned 
from 1740 to 1786 and Charles the Great from a.D. 
2—2

  20 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
768 to 814. Moreover, they are unable to dis- 
tinguish between these prose narratives of historical 
events and the corresponding poems which deal with 
historical characters. They cannot understand, 
thank heaven! the difference between a legend of 
Charles the Great and a history of Charles the Great, 
and it would be a complete mistake to transform 
their legendary and poetical Roland into the 
Hruotland of history. In a German reading-book 
for the second form we find “Cadmus (about 
1500 B.c.),” a statement typical of the confusion 
between legend and history. 
The Prussian syllabus of 1892 laid down that its 
“Character Sketches from the History of the 
Fatherland ” should be chosen with reference to the 
pupil’s home; that, for instance, in Cologne the 
subjects of instruction should be the lives of Albertus 
Magnus or St. Martin, or Reinald of Dassel. We can 
see no adequate reason for this regulation. It seems’ 
a matter of complete indifference in what order these 
narratives from the history of our own country 
should be read or explained, whether they should 
begin from Cologne and end in Berlin, or follow any 
other route. Each one of them has its own value 
as providing food for the pupil’s mind. The 
Prussian syllabus of 1901, which has quietly cor- 
rected many mistakes in the two _ preceding 
syllabuses, simply says on p. 47: “‘ The great heroic 
figures of the near and remoter past.” 
As regards the distribution of the material between 
the First and Second Forms, a tendency is obvious, 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  PRELIMINARY STAGE 21 
springing from patriotic feelings, to lay great stress 
upon a knowledge of German legends at the 
earliest possible stage. In some syllabuses I find 
that these legends include German mythology, 
expressly stated as the ground to be covered by the 
First Form: it would be preferable to warn teachers 
off this ground. It is not my experience that 
Hildebrant and Hadubrant, Titurel and Frimutel, 
Parzival and Herzeloyde, Orilus and Schionatu- 
lander, or even Repanse and Fierefiz of Anjou, 
have especially excited the imagination of our 
first-form boys. These legends become important 
to boys only by an indirect method; they must 
first have secured some historical interest in their 
nation, which can be gained by some intimacy with 
such figures as Theoderich, Etzel, or with chivalry 
in general. When this has been done it would be 
advisable to reserve information concerning the 
medieval legends of Germany for the German 
reading-book in the Fourth Form, where these 
stories are brought into connexion with their special 
and natural environment, and can then produce 
their due effect ; this, again, is the proper age for 
beginning the study of the Nibelungenlied. On the 
other hand, it is, in our opinion, entirely reasonable 
and correct to introduce the important personalities 
of our national history to these two lowest classes, 
by means of anecdotes, experiences in their lives, 
and character sketches: at the same time, the only 
object here should be to produce an immediate 
effect. Order makes not the smallest difference.

  22 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
On Monday an instructive story of Blicher and 
Moltke can be read or told, and followed on Tuesday 
by a similar story of Charles the Great; pupils at 
this stage have but the most elementary concep- 
tions of chronology, and require nothing more 
complicated for a time. The only immediate object 
is to enrich their imagination with attractive figures 
and deeds from the history of their own people, and 
this process can be called, so far as we are con- 
cerned, the inculcation of patriotism, if any sonorous 
catch-word be required. 
The Second Form reading-book should also contain 
pieces of the same kind, especially nieces of poetry, 
and in particular a selection from the finest legends 
of classical antiquity, as many as possible from 
Greek mythology—Prometheus, Phaethon, Cadmus, 
Daedalus, etc., and some few legends from Roman 
history. The earlier Prussian syllabuses are here quite 
right in saying that the legend proper of classical 
antiquity should be assigned to the reading of the 
classical languages and to the hours for instruction in 
German ; to the latter, therefore, in the Form of which 
we are speaking. At the same time it is not wholly 
clear what is meant by the term legends “proper ”’ ; 
something else is apparently meant than that 
which appears in the syllabus of 1901 as an entirely 
superfluous historical study out of connexion with 
any other ; “ narratives from the legends of classical 
antiquity from early Greek history (until Solon) and 
from Roman history (until the war with Pyrrhus).” 
We need not, however, dispute further about words.
-P-A-G-E-45
  PRELIMINARY STAGE 23 
We are everywhere in favour of simplicity, and we 
therefore prefer four hours of German to three hours 
of German and an hour of history, though the 
difference is not material. It is unnecessary to 
enlarge upon the fact that these legends can be made 
beautiful and valuable in the hands, or rather in 
the mouth, of a teacher who has himself a youthful 
feeling of sympathy for their poetry. After a lapse 
of more than sixty years I can myself recall the 
deep impression made upon me by the first sentences 
in the classical work of Gustav Schwab: “‘ Heaven 
and earth were created; the sea rolled its waves, 
and the fishes played therein ; the feathered fowls 
sang in the air, and the earth was covered with 
moving animals.’”’ We are only considering the 
subject as it bears upon historical instruction, and 
as it can provide preparation, or has itself become 
a preparation for this instruction which the Form 
will soon have to begin. Take, for instance, the 
story of Cadmus on page 87 of the most general, 
though perhaps not the best reading-book for the 
Second -Form—that by Hopf and Paulsiek. After 
the piece has been read through in sections and the 
teacher has convinced himself that every one has 
understood it, he will have it retold with books 
closed. He will then ask what the boys have noticed 
in the story, and in a manner entirely natural and 
unforced, without injury to the poetry of the legend, 
and avoiding any elaboration of special points, the 
Form will learn the name Europa, will learn of the 
Pheenician nation and their discoveries, will hear
-P-A-G-E-46
  24 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
what an oracle is, will learn the names of some 
Greek places—Crete, Delphi, and Thebes, will learn 
also the names of some Greek gods; while it is also 
permissible to say a word upon our debt to the old 
nation of the Phoenicians. Instruction of this kind 
comes into connexion with other material—for 
instance, with such Latin words as have been learnt, 
and this we would add, without any special effort 
upon the teacher's part. All that we ask of him, 
in this case and in others, is to use as far as he can 
the moral forces inherent in every worthy and 
tangible object, especially if described in noble 
language, and above all things not to destroy its 
efficacy by attempts to do too much at one time. 
A more powerful and immediate influence, foster- 
ing and stimulating the early growth of the historical 
sense, is the religious instruction given at this stage. 
It may be said at once that instruction in the 
Christian religion, the third of the sources which we 
have distinguished above, is from the outset historical 
instruction of the first and most elementary kind in 
the First and Second Forms of our middle schools. 
This fact has been recognized by the present 
syllabus of 1901 in its observations upon the 
methods of history upon p. 47, but has not been 
sufficiently emphasized. Religious instruction is 
primarily Bible history taken from the Old Testament 
in the First Form, and from the New Testament in 
the Second ; teaching upon the Catechism, or any 
other instruction given in connexion with the 
parish or the church, does not concern us here.
-P-A-G-E-47
PRELIMINARY STAGE 25 
There is no question here of substituting one con- 
_ ception for another, and we need not therefore go 
back to Bossuet’s Discours sur Vhistoire universelle, 
or to the Preparatio evangelica of Eusebius ; it is 
clear from the outset that Bible stories, or the Bible 
story as a whole, are properly preliminary to later 
historical instruction, and must therefore be treated 
by the methods of such instruction, if religion is to 
secure her rights and her interests, which are 
precisely similar to those of history. Religious 
instruction, especially in the Gospels, is primarily 
historical instruction, and this not merely in the 
more extraneous sense of the word; for instance, 
if Moses and his learning and the wisdom of the 
Egyptians should be the point, the boy of nine years 
old may very well be told who the Egyptians were, 
and in what their ““ wisdom ” consisted : may hear 
something of their hieroglyphics, their pyramids, 
their Lake Meeris, etc. ; or, again, in the New Testa- 
ment, the Second-Form boy may of himself acquire 
some idea of the great Roman Empire and its 
_ provincial administration. Nor, again, is it merely 
in the more serious and fruitful sense of the term that 
pupils can of their own accord realise in their own 
way certain historical conceptions which afterwards 
become of great importance, such as the patriarchal 
system of nomadic life and the growth of the tribe 
to the nation ; they are confronted with anarchical 
conditions, with the irregular but effective powér 
of men (the Judges) who hold no office, but guide 
the destinies of a nation by force of character ; the 
  “teed
-P-A-G-E-48
  26 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
people itself is described and described inimitably, 
now enthusiastic, now timorous, blindly credulous 
or defiantly unbelieving, asking for guidance, and 
again rejecting it with the temper of a child 
demanding miracles and signs—the people as it 
is, as it was, and as it will be; the pupils hear of 
taxes, of anarchy, of priesthood, of kingship, and 
of many other things which cannot be made entirely 
clear by definition, for we may challenge any of our 
pundits to give us a definition of the term “‘ nation.” 
These things, however,-must become a part of 
experience before they can be used, and this, if 
anywhere, is possible in biblical history ; this realisa- 
tion will also be entirely uncritical, a point of no 
mean importance, and to the pupils what they hear 
will be unconditional truth and undoubted reality. 
But the fact must also be emphasized that this 
progress through the “ Bible history ”’ is a pre- 
liminary stage to all historical instruction in a yet 
deeper sense. We have previously stated that 
‘history ” is primarily and from the outset a con- 
ception of humanity as an ethical whole ; this con- 
ception is presupposed in “ Bible history.” If we 
wish to embark upon speculative inferences we shall 
be forced to say that the idea of God is included in 
this conception, and that without this idea humanity 
cannot be conceived as an ethical whole ; the only 
point of importance to us here is the fact that boys 
of nine and ten can only conceive of these two— 
God and man, divinity and humanity, in connexion. 
These complementary conceptions are, however, not 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
PRELIMINARY STAGE 27 
only provided by the religious instruction in Bible 
history, but they are also presented in a form 
intelligible to the immature mind; hence they 
become firmly rooted, apart from the fact that they 
are presented on the basis of an authority of incom- 
parable power. We have the idea of a chosen 
family believing in the true God and growing to a 
tribe, which, while preserving its belief, becomes a 
people; to the people God gives the law of its life 
in the promised land, and concludes a covenant 
with it. We observe the prosperity, the decline and 
fall of this people, the narrowness and limitation 
of their conception of a national God, and the 
gradual overcoming of this narrowness, until the 
history of this people coincides with the history of 
the one personality of Jesus, and thus rises and 
widens to world history. Here we have in the 
most popular and effective form conceivable the 
necessary hypothesis upon which all later histori- 
cal instruction must be based. Here lie concealed 
in embryo the highest tasks and objects of history, 
whether they be regarded as forming a philosophy 
of history, or included under some other term ; all 
later instruction and further study must remain 
conscious of its connection with these fundamental 
points if the study of history is not to be annihilated 
by the bitter sarcasm or despair of the question 
which Goethe places in the mouth of Faust : 
** Am I perchance in thousand books to read 
That everywhere mankind has toiled in vain, 
That here and there one has found happiness ?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  28 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
On this point we have no further advice for the 
teacher ; the more entirely he treats these Bible 
stories as history—-that is to say, as accomplished 
fact—the better will he provide for the rising 
religious sense in his pupils ; the more he treats this 
instruction as religion, and the more he devotes to 
it his heart and all the higher forces of his soul, the 
more will he do for the historical sense of his pupils. 
Historical criticism, it is almost superfluous to add, 
will be entirely false here, where the pupil can neither 
follow it nor make it his own by reflection ; what 
is wanted is the undisturbed narration of this history, 
laying due emphasis upon its religious content, for 
the Bible stories contain deepest truths, whatever 
views may be held of their authenticity. 
We have made no mention of geography as a 
formative influence upon the historical sense at 
this stage; in any case, geography does not hold 
that position ; it stands in far closer relationship to 
history which is inconceivable without it. The 
two studies are indivisible, and are divided only for 
imperative practical reasons, in order that they 
may afterwards join hands when they have accom- 
plished their separate progress. Here in the First 
Form the first progress is made through the great 
scene upon which the world’s history has been 
played out, when the use of atlases or maps has 
begun. The more simply and _ intelligently the 
master is able to acquaint his pupils with mountains, 
rivers, seas, etc., the more certainly will he be 
paving the way for the later historical instruction.
-P-A-G-E-51
  PRELIMINARY STAGE 29° 
There is no reason why he should not tell his pupils 
something of Columbus, Cook, Franklin, or Nansen, 
etc. We must, however, observe that we are 
entirely opposed to the regulation of the Prussian 
syllabus which lays down that the First Form should 
gain a general acquaintance with the atlas, and then 
confines the Second Form to the geography of 
Germany, nor are we in any way converted by the 
reasons adduced for this method. It is a subject 
oi study wholly profitless at this stage. A boy of 
ten years brings no interest to the geography of his 
country, let alone of his native place, which is 
neither of scientific character in itself, nor can 
prepare him for scientific study; the study otf 
immediate environment only becomes interesting 
when the mind has grown maturer, and has been 
enriched with historical and with other information. 
For secondary schools the fundamental principle of 
geographical study is certainly this: that it should 
begin with outlying regions and work back to the 
home; but should not proceed from the school- 
room to the village and its duck-pond, thence to 
the province, thence to Germany, and so on, through 
Europe and the other continents. We shall recur 
to this mode of study when treating of the Fourth 
Form. 
In modern schools the conditions at this stage 
differ little from those that obtain in the classical 
schools. Latin is certainly absent, and for this 
there is nothing to compensate ; nor, indeed, is com- 
pensation required, since the pupil of the modern 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  30 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
school does not propose to specialize in history as 
does the pupil of the classical school ; his object is 
to learn his bearings rather than to gain a know- 
ledge of detail. Meanwhile, it must be noticed 
that the Prussian syllabus for modern schools 
provides an hour more for the study of German 
(German and historical narrative) than is given to 
the classical school: 4+1 instead of 3+1, and in 
the Second Form 3+ 1 instead of 2+1. The reading- 
book for the First and Second Forms in modern 
schools will differ correspondingly, and certainly in 
length, from the reading-book of the classical school ; 
it will therefore, and in our opinion it should, include 
more historical narrative. We shall afterwards see 
that the desire for the positive and the practical 
has provided a good supply of historical material 
for memorizing, has given the instruction in the 
modern school a character somewhat different from 
that which obtains in the classical school, and has 
possibly provided a certain advantage for this side 
of historical instruction, which we ought not to 
under-estimate.
-P-A-G-E-53
II 
INTERMEDIATE STAGE 
From THE THIRD Form To THE LOWER FIFTH. 
HIsTORICAL instruction proper can now begin; its 
preliminary conditions have been already ex- 
pounded ; these consist in the appropriation of that 
knowledge and of those conceptions which we have 
already explained or indicated, and in the inevitable 
influences, difficult to estimate, which accompany 
the appropriation of these conceptions. We do 
not mean to assert that as the clock strikes eight 
upon the morning of the day on which the pupil 
begins work in the Third Form, he also begins to be 
capable of following historical instruction with profit. 
There will be many of the pupils who have long 
since had access to historical books, which may be 
excellent, such as the Greek and Roman histories of 
©. L. Roth, or of very doubtful value compiled by 
incompetent hands. The latter class of readers, the 
cumberers of our ground, must be taken as they 
are ; everybody knows that at this age much that 
is bad can be read without serious loss, and we 
hope that the time is still far distant when home 
d1 
   
-P-A-G-E-54
  32 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
reading will be subject to the inspection of the all- 
compelling scholastic powers, and no boy allowed te, 
read anything unless his tutor, 7/ suo pedante, as the: 
Italians say, is looking over his shoulder. The 
point at issue is that in the Third Form, usually the 
third year in the classical school, that stage is 
reached when regular historical instruction can 
begin to the extent of two lessons a week, as a rule ; 
when there is an orderly progress commenced 
through the last thirty centuries of human history, 
in contrast to the irregular excursions which pupils 
have hitherto made into this subject either in the 
school or for their own purposes. 
At this point some preliminary questions must be 
briefly noticed. Schools with nine classes have 
arranged their scheme of historical teaching by long 
tradition and by a kind of convention, so that the 
course of history is twice repeated—once in child-_ 
hood and again, with the necessary modifications, . 
in youth. This arrangement, as we have seen,,; 
originates immediately in the nature of those schools . 
which keep their pupils from childhood until 
youth, or even until early manhood. As far as we 
can see, the syllabuses of the different states are in 
agreement on this point, and we shall therefore 
decline to discuss any proposals which ignore this 
necessity for duplication, and proceed to demand for 
the Sixth Form some mixture of historical lectures, _ 
study of sources, and other supposed methods. of. 
extending and deepening knowledge. The principle 
of two readings, or even three, is universally advisable.
-P-A-G-E-55
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 33 
in legislation and in parliamentary life, as in the 
private reading of good books; it is a habit retained 
throughout life by the sensible man, and in historical 
instruction it is especially illuminating and profitable. 
In the Prussian schools, and in those which have 
adopted their new regulations, the first course of in- 
struction proceeds from the Third Form to the Lower 
Fifth—that is, to the well-known turning-point at 
which some strike off right and left into the forest, 
while others pursue their way to the leaving examina- 
tion. These latter repeat the course during their 
three years in the Upper Fifth, Lower Sixth, and 
Upper Sixth. 
The second preliminary problem is not so much 
a problem as a whimsicality characteristic of our 
age and of the position of the secondary teacher ; it 
is raised by the latest question: Should history be 
begun at its (relative) beginning or its (relative) 
end? The first man to conceive and express the 
sold idea that historical instruction should begin 
at the present moment or the immediate past and 
work backwards to primitive times was d’Alembert, 
as I learn from Mahrenholz.* In our days, when we 
are reforming everything on earth except ourselves, 
this idea has also aroused some transitory attention, 
but has disappeared, leaving its mark only in certain 
text-books, monstrosities of historical teaching. This 
much is known to every one, as is also the fact that 
an antiquarian scholar of importance half adopted 
* Wandlungen der Geschichtsauffassung und des Geschichtsun- 
terricht (Hamburg, 1891, p. 71). 
3
-P-A-G-E-56
  34 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
this idea, and seized the opportunity of speaking 
with greater or less profundity as an amateur upon 
historical teaching ;* he merely succeeded in proving 
that anyone at the present, with a little reputation 
can write upon matters of which he knows abso- 
lutely nothing, and find readers, and even pro- 
fessional experts, to take him seriously, to discuss 
his ideas, and thus to give a certain importance to 
mere amateurism. We must mention the fact at 
this point because the secondary teacher is a pioneer, 
if ever there was one, and when he is a historical 
teacher, is a pioneer in a special sense and fights 
under very difficult conditions, and he therefore 
on occasion has, according to the old proverb, 
many masters—at any rate, many who exercise 
mastery over him. And therefore we must not 
omit to express our conviction that at every stage of 
historical instruction it is of importance that the 
teacher in charge should acquire and preserve the 
mental independence of the expert, and should 
boldly maintain it when necessary against super- 
ficial amateurism or against clerical espionage, by 
no means unexampled at the present time. 
The same idea has occasionally. occurred from 
the eighteenth century onwards in a less grotesque 
form, namely, in the assertion that what is termed 
more modern or most modern national history should 
be made preliminary both inelementary and advanced 
instruction, and should be followed by the history of 
antiquity ; while Karl Peter has for years eagerly con- 
* Hermann Grimm in the Deutsche Rundschau, 1891, No. 12.
-P-A-G-E-57
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 35 
tended that ancient history must be the special care 
of the upper stages of the Sixth Form. It is, how- 
ever, unnecessary to refute these opinions, as in every 
case proper conceptions of historical teaching have 
won their way or have remained unopposed. 
We shall begin at the beginning. Historical 
instruction in the Third Form is the history of 
antiquity—that is, of the Greeks and Romans— 
with the addition of such part of the history of the 
ancient peoples of the East as may seem necessary. 
Some authorities assert that a general view of this 
latter subject should precede the study of Greek 
history, speak of the growing importance which 
Oriental history has acquired through discovery, 
and perhaps express even in these views the 
momentary unpopularity of Greek and Roman 
civilization as a subject for study. The fact, how- 
ever, is undoubted, that for ourselves, who are 
Germans and Europeans, Greek and Roman history 
is of far more importance than Egyptian or 
Assyrian ; our arrangements have to be made upon 
a basis of two lessons a week extending over one 
year, and in this elementary stage simple arrange- 
ment is essential. Hence we must be content with 
the history of those two nations—a history, moreover, 
which stands in no immediate need of antiquarian 
research, but is in touch with the modern world by 
reason of unbroken tradition. We, as Europeans 
and Germans, stand upon the same footing of 
freedom as these two nations, that mysterious force 
which first became life and reality upon Greek 
3—2
-P-A-G-E-58
  36 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
soil; we, in short, like the Greeks and Romans, 
are Western and not Eastern nations, and therefore 
Greek and Roman history is not only more interest- 
ing, but also more intelligible, to ourselves and to 
our Third-Form pupils. Bible history will have 
already acquainted our pupils with the Oriental 
nations, and opportunity arises here and there for 
providing some necessary information about them— 
for instance, before beginning the narrative of the 
Persian wars, when East and West, the Persian 
monarch and the world of the Greek City States, 
came into collision. At this point a teacher is obliged 
to say something of the great Eastern monarchs, of 
their rise and of the conditions of their existence. 
Tuirp Form. 
We now reach the main question, which, in accord- 
ance with prevailing custom, is usually proposed in 
some highly pretentious or euphuistic form—the 
problem of the “task of historical instruction ” 
in the Third Form. We propose to put the question 
in more concrete form. During the year which is 
devoted to this first progress through ancient 
history the master has to deal with a class of twenty, 
thirty, or forty boys for two hours a week—that is, 
for some eighty hours altogether. What can he do 
and what ought he to attain during this period, and 
what must be the special objects of his attention, 
and how are they conditioned by the nature of his 
subject and the character of his pupils ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 37 
We must first consider the character of this stage 
and of the instruction given within it ; I hold that 
in the case of these boys between eleven and thirteen 
years of age, the teacher’s effort should be directed 
to the task of securing greater unity and connexion 
in their hitherto fragmentary knowledge. In the 
Latin lessons this unification is beginning ; connected 
pieces are more and more translated, and some con- 
nected author, such as Cornelius Nepos, is read and 
forms a whole. In religious instruction the Old Testa- 
ment is put into their hands, or some reading-book 
based thereon which contains complete books of the 
Bible, or, at any rate, large selections from them, 
and here, again, unity is apparent. In their German 
lessons a similar process is going on: the selections 
in the reading-book are to be grouped and arranged 
in order to connect them together, and the first 
step in the land of reality is taken by means of 
essay-writing, as the exercise is not improperly 
named. Historical instruction must therefore 
appear as a connected whole, representing the 
life of two important nations from their origin to 
their decline, or to their transition into new forms. 
Before we consider the nature of this special 
historical instruction, with its two hours a week, or 
possibly three, in the Prussian modern schools, we 
must also ask what formative influences are pro- 
vided by the remaining studies in this Form, which 
can contribute to the development of the historical 
sense ; these we shall now indicate briefly. 
The horizon of the pupil at the secondary school
-P-A-G-E-60
  38 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
is now extended by the introduction of a new 
language—French.* It is by no means a matter of 
indifference that this language has developed from 
the Latin which the pupils have already learnt, 
though at this stage it is obvious that nothing more 
can be done than to mention the general fact, as 
explanation and illustration with numerous examples 
are hardly possible. __ 
We have already explained that every word of 
Latin instruction contains implicit history, and the 
knowledge of this language is now extended and 
deepened; the formation of certain elementary 
historical ideas concerning state, king, compact, 
law, alliance, etc., quietly proceeds with the reading 
of an ancient author within the range of a Third 
Form, such as Cornelius Nepos. 
Religious instruction is also proceeding, and con- 
tinues to be historical instruction, the more so as 
considerable excerpts from the Old Testament are 
now read; here we have the study of sources in 
pure form, while the instruction concentrates 
attention upon human life and action from the strict 
standpoint of moral and religious criticism; thus 
the pupil gains a higher standard by which he may 
judge the deeds and the men whom he will meet in 
his history lessons. 
* This is the natural line of progress for a school which is to 
be introductory to scientific thought—that is, for the secondary 
school ; it is also one of the reasons which induce us to oppose 
the curriculum of the reformed secondary school. To make 
Latin the first foreign language is to us a question of educational 
policy, and to the secondary school is a vital question.
-P-A-G-E-61
    INTERMEDIATE STAGE 39 
Further, the instruction in German continues to 
introduce the German national literature in an 
elementary manner. To put the matter more 
simply, the boy learns to read good German books 
with intelligence, and thus improves and practises 
the powers which are necessary to understand 
historical connexion. 
Finally, what should be obvious from the outset, 
but rarely meets with due appreciation, history 
and geography become close and natural allies. 
The union between these two sciences may 
produce admirable results both here and elsewhere, 
provided that either science is treated with due 
regard to the other, and at the same time confined 
within its proper bounds. History in this elemen- 
tary stage, and henceforward until the high stages 
are reached, will always provide a geographical 
reference to the places of which it treats ; these will 
always be shown or found upon the map. Geography, 
again, will provide some meaning for the place- 
names which occur, by reference to, their historical 
importance whenever possible. Clearly, this cannot 
be done until the pupils have acquired some know- 
ledge of history; the fact is recognized in most 
German: schools by the principle which states that 
the two: geographical’ lessons should’ treat of the 
geography: of Europe, and the two historical lessons 
should deal with the two: nations, the Greeks and 
the Romans, which really gave the word “ Europe ” 
its meaning in the history of civilization. 
The first introduction of boys of eleven or twelve
-P-A-G-E-62
  40 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
years old to the national life of one people can only 
be secured by dividing. history into histories and into 
small sections, each of which is presented as a self- 
contained whole whenever, possible ; the subject of 
instruction, is therefore histories taken from Greek 
and Roman history in chronological order. We 
say histories and not biographies, important as 
biographical study may be. Greek history is 
terminated with the death of Alexander the Great, 
and Roman history with Augustus and the Battle 
of Actium ; neither the Diadochi nor the Roman 
imperial rule can be made subjects of detailed 
treatment for the Third Form. Hence we shall 
approve the practice of the Prussian and of the 
other German syllabuses, which make Solon in 
Greek history and Pyrrhus in Roman history the 
starting-points of more detailed study; in former 
times much useless toil was expended upon the 
Pelasgic period and the age of the Roman Kings. 
As we have observed, there is no objection to making 
these same historical periods the material of the 
German instruction in the lower Forms ; they must 
also form part of the history studied by the Third 
Form, and must be presented shortly and summarily, 
thus leading up to more detailed narratives of Solon 
and Pyrrhus. 
Theorists upon historical instruction have often 
spoken of the distinction between a purely didactic 
side and an ethical side or influence, and have 
referred to the training of the sympathies and. 
imagination, to the hardening of the will, to the
-P-A-G-E-63
INTERMEDIATE STAGE 4] 
stimulus of patriotism and of the religious sense 
etc. Ethical influence is inherent in the first place 
in the material of instruction, in the second place in 
the personality instructing, and in the third place, 
as in all other subjects, in the performance of duty. 
here, however, as in every case, the object of primary 
importance at school is the act of learning, and the 
task of securing that the pupils should appropriate 
matter worthy of study, with all the strength of 
their will, their intellect, and their memory. Mean- 
while the master’s task is to present this history 
to his pupils in such a manner as to secure two 
‘ results : 
/ Firstly, the most important events with their dates 
must be engraven upon their memories. 
Secondly, they must be able to make some ele- 
mentary use of what they have learnt. 
y This object may be secured by three means. 
/ These are, the text-book, the teacher’s commentary 
/ or lecture, and the revision by the pupil. Of these 
three we have now to speak, not merely with refer- 
ence to this, but with reference to every stage of 
. instruction. 
A text-book is essential at this point as a basis of 
instruction. A mere table of dates and names is 
not sufficient, for the reason that the Form does not 
yet understand how to use a table, no matter how it 
be constructed ; a text-book together with a table, 
even if it be nothing more than a so-called canon, 
is equally inadvisable, for the reason that the 
pupil’s desk is already crowded with far too many

books. The text-book for a Third Form must there- 
fore contain tables—that is to say, after every 
section a short list must be given of the most impor- 
tant facts, with their dates, to be learnt by the pupil ; 
and at the end of the book these facts and dates 
must be printed together in connected form, so that 
the pupil can have the whole result of his year’s 
work before his eye. We do not propose to recom- 
mend particularly any of the countless text-books 
in existence. 
Assuming that the teacher is able to choose for 
himself, or assuming that in his deliberate judgment 
the book in use is unpractical—as, for instance, 
is the work of Piitz for middle forms ; assuming, 
again, that his head master is amenable to technical 
arguments upon the subject, and has no objection 
to the inconvenience of introducing a new book, 
then the teacher has to find a text-book with the 
following qualities : it must be decently printed and 
bound, qualities which apply to every school-book, 
but apart from this it must divide the subject- 
matter into reasonable divisions ; it must not be 
too thick nor too thin—in other words, the material 
it contains must be such as can be properly ex- 
hausted within the given period of eighty lessons ; 
thirdly, it must contain nothing unhistorical ; and, 
fourthly, it must recount, expound, and teach, but 
not narrate its subject-matter—in other words, it 
must contain nothing that is not history ; if legend 
or poetry are quoted, their nature must be stated, 
and uncertain events must be introduced with the 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 43 
phrase “It is said.” Thus, in the case of the 
history of the Roman Kings, it must show that these 
stories are told to boys of the twentieth century 
with some detail, not because they are more or less 
representative accounts of the seven Kings, but 
because these stories were firmly believed some two 
or three thousand years ago to be the early history 
of their famous town by the Roman people—men, 
women, and children, by high and low. This, 
however, is not the only point ; the narrative style 
of many, if not of the majority of text-books, shows 
that their authors did not understand what history 
is. A case in point is the widely disseminated work 
of Welter, a clever book in its entirely false style. 
These books either, like Welter, adopt the style 
of a novel or else of a rhetorician; an excellent 
criticism uttered, I believe, by Niebuhr upon the 
once popular Histoire Romaine of Rollin said that 
history was there narrated as if it had not really 
happened. Here there will soon be an improvement, 
which has, indeed, already begun as far as we can 
see ; since we have become a nation in the political 
sense of the term, our historical teaching has been 
marked by something of that é& ad’rav Trav mpaypwatov 
é&is, by the “spirit which statecraft inspires,’ and 
therefore by that political realism which Polybius 
demands of the historian ; something, too, of this 
strong spirit, of this mwpayyatixns iotoplas tporos, 
may or ought to form an element in the historical 
teaching of a Third Form. 
This, however, is a point difficult to estimate,
-P-A-G-E-66
44 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
and in any case incommunicable ; another point 
that we have mentioned, that the text-book should 
not be a narrative, but merely a presentation of 
material, is easier to criticize than to explain. In 
reviews and elsewhere we constantly meet the 
foolish theory which demands that the text-book 
should perform what is really the function of the 
teacher’s commentary or of the reading-book. 
Only recently I read a criticism upon a popular 
text-book, which stated that though a valuable 
performance it could not inspire the pupil with 
enthusiasm. Many authors attempt to vivify the 
dryness of the text-oook with anecdotes, appeals 
to feeling, and epitheta ornantia, such as “the bold 
Pelopidas,”’ ‘the honourable Phocion,” etc. This is 
a mistaken point of view. At the same time a text- 
book for the third form need not necessarily be 
wearisome, any more than are, for example, the 
epitomes of Livy. Macaulay, in his essay upon 
Goldsmith, rightly praises him for his power of 
making the epitomes of his histories attractive : 
‘“‘in general nothing is less attractive than an 
epitome ; but the epitomes of Goldsmith, even 
when most concise, are always amusing, and to read 
them is considered by intelligent children, not as a 
task, but as a pleasure.”’ This should be our ideal ; 
the text-book is not to be conversational in the 
vulgar sense of the term, but children should be 
attracted by it. 
The tone and character of the instruction is, how- 
ever, determined by the teacher, and follows from
-P-A-G-E-67
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 45 
his grasp of the subject, his manner of presenting 
it, and his mode of narrative ; on these points the 
text-book should not prejudge his efforts. In dis- 
cussions upon the teacher’s commentary or lecture 
high-flown language has naturally been expended ; 
it should be realistic, enthusiastic, convincing, 
extempore ; the teacher should call events vividly 
before the pupil’s eye ; every lesson should be a work 
of art, etc. A warning must be uttered against 
catchwords everywhere, but most of all in historical 
teaching. They either induce the young teacher to 
adopt a false rhetorical style or discourage him, 
and he feels obliged to admit to himself that his 
lecture does not realize these sonorous phrases. 
He may calm his mind; even the heroes of these 
proud demands do not make practice correspond 
with precept ; what can be attained and ought to be 
attained by a conscientious teacher of moderate 
gifts is as follows: it is no small achievement, and 
it is adequate. 
A style of lecture-teaching essentially informal, 
as is natural and desirable at this stage of instruc- 
tion, can be attained after some period of learning 
and practice. Our object at this moment is not 
to deal with a large mass of information in one 
lesson, but merely to expound such material as 
the text-book provides, and provides in sections of 
moderate length ; moreover, the teacher is perfectly 
well able, without exciting the surprise of his pupils, 
to glance at the text-book from time to time, if 
the thread of his argument escape him, as may
-P-A-G-E-68
  46 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
very well happen. But the first condition for a 
good lesson, and above all for a good history lesson, 
is proper preparation, and preparation must be of 
two kinds: it must be devoted to the subject as a 
whole, and to the lesson in particular. For a Third- 
Form history lesson the first object is attained if 
the teacher reads or re-reads a good Greek or Roman 
history, though this is a practice which must be 
continued. He should read one history and not 
six, that he may become acquainted with the whole 
of the area which he must cover with his pupils, and 
gain a living knowledge of it. If he has time, and 
time he may gain by leaving for once unread long- 
winded reports, replies, theses, essays, etc., he had 
better read for his general preparation one Greek 
and one Roman original source—for instance, the 
whole of Herodotus and the whole of Livy—in order 
that he may secure the benefits of which the latter 
speaks: ceterwm et mihi vetustas res (de)scribenti 
nescio quo pacto antiquus fit animus. A_ first 
analysis which he will make for his own instruction 
should be kept, as it may prove of value at a later 
time, and will be improved in the course of teaching ; 
for upon the whole it may be said that the mind is 
never more inclined to productive and creative 
energy than when engaged in teaching. As regards 
preparation for a particular lesson, the teacher must 
be entirely clear upon the course which his lesson 
is to take, and must at the same time make himself 
entirely master of that moderate amount of material 
which can be used for one lesson. When thus
-P-A-G-E-69
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 47 
equipped he should, after hearing the revision of 
which we will speak presently, have a complete 
section read aloud by one or two boys. Let us 
suppose it is the section dealing with King Pyrrhus 
and the war with Tarentum. He will then retell 
the story in greater detail with all the clarity of 
his intelligence and practical knowledge, with all 
the vividness that his imagination and descriptive 
talent will permit, and with all the warmth that his 
sympathy and his confidence will allow. Above 
all things, he should strive to secure simple and clear 
language, and remember the good rule which appears 
as early as the Methodus tradendi in scholis historiam 
for the Germanic province of the Jesuit Order 
about 1717; tarde fiat narratio, ut sequi possint 
discipult.* The more practised teacher can natu- 
rally reverse the process by first telling the story, 
and then making the Form read the section ; this, 
indeed, is the better method, but considerable 
practice is required to present historical material 
from the right point of view to boys at this stage, 
and I therefore regard the former method as more 
advisable for those beginners for whom these pages 
are specially intended. The course of events, when 
necessary and possible, is explained by reference to 
the map, and the teacher must convince himself 
that they have been understood by making the 
Form repeat his narrative when the subject invites 
this method (unusual, see below) ; for the most part 
he will secure this end by short questions and by 
* Monumenta Germanie pedagogica, XVI., p. 107.
-P-A-G-E-70
48 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
a simple catechism: Repeat the main battles of 
the Tarentine War; the names of the most impor- 
tant leaders and statesmen ; the districts where the 
war was carried on, etc. At this point a few ques- 
tions may be introduced, though not too frequently, 
appealing to the intellect: In what way did the 
Roman nation defeat the King who was originally 
victorious ? Why did Hannibal consider it important 
to reach the district of the Po with his army ? 
Should a district, such as Bceotia or Thessaly 
appear in Roman history, he will ask what the boys 
know of these districts in Greek history, and so 
forth. 
In this connexion we must refer to the ethical 
effect of teaching, and the extent to which this can 
be produced by the teacher’s lecture. Recipes 
have already been published for stimulating 
patriotism by emphasizing the heroism of the three | 
hundred Spartans at Thermopyle or of the 
_ Athenians at Salamis, and possibly in the course of 
time some psycho-physiological method will be 
found of making historical dates a stimulus to 
patriotism ; in the meanwhile we would utter an 
emphatic warning against this mode of treatment. 
It is impossible to conceive of any worse mistake 
when explaining a lesson than to spend time in 
preaching patriotism or any other noble quality.* 
* Excellent are the words on this point of the above-men- 
tioned method for the Jesuit schools: ‘‘ Doctrinas morales e re 
natas immisceat professor, non multas tamen.... Reflexiones 
he ad moralia brevissime sint, ne concio prodeat loco historia.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-71
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 49 
The beauty of great and lofty historical events, such 
as the attitude of the Roman senate after the Battle 
of Canne, consists in the fact that they give their 
own lesson. Herodotus says nothing further on 
Ephialtes, except that “He was the man whom I 
_ write down as guilty’ (adda TodTov aitiov ypada) 
and nothing more of Leonidas than avijp dpiotos 
yevouevos. Similarly Tschudi, in his Chronicon 
Helveticum, says of Arnold von Winckelried : 
‘There was a man of Unterwalden by name Arnold 
von Winckelried, an honourable knight ; he sprang 
forth from the ranks, and embraced with his arms 
a number of the hostile spears ; thus he sacrificed his 
life.’ This is the ideal narrative style, especially 
in historical narrative for Third-Form boys. No 
special stress, in the old style, should be laid upon 
the astonishing heroism ot men like Regulus or 
the prisoners of Pyrrhus, who were released upon 
parole, kept their word, and returned to captivity. 
At the same time we should wish to mention one 
further rule upon this subject. The teacher should 
relate history as a man—not as a schoolmaster—as 
the patriot which it is to be hoped he is, and as 
consequently able to appreciate the deep patriotism 
of such a man as Aristides or Demosthenes ; he need 
not suppress his enthusiasm if it breaks from him 
involuntarily upon the relation of some bold deed, 
but he should not attempt to lash himself to 
enthusiasm, for this is precisely the way not to find 
it. Another point may be remembered. It is a 
matter of experience that pupils at this age prefer 
t
-P-A-G-E-72
  50 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
history lessons to any other, perhaps together with 
the German lesson. This frame of mind which 
meets the teacher half-way is a capital on which 
admirable interest can be secured, and its value 
need not be enhanced by any artificial methods. 
This special characteristic of the history lesson, its 
popularity with the boys, a popularity which is 
unshaken and should remain so in the case of the 
Third Form, necessitates a further fact; that home- 
work should be given very sparingly. There should 
be a little, a very little, but something should 
always and regularly be given, otherwise the boy 
will incline to despise the subject. The Form 
should simply be told to read over in their text- 
book, for the next time, the ground that has been 
covered in any one day. At this stage it will be 
understood that no other preparation is possible 
for the history lesson except this repetition of what 
has been already done. 
These facts lead us to the third factor in historical 
instruction—revision. Home-lessons obviously con- 
sist of revision directly from the text-book ; in the 
Third Form there is no taking of notes, and on this 
subject we need not dwell, though dictation has 
formerly played a part even at this stage. Revision 
itself is of two kinds. First there is the repetition 
of what has been gone through in lesson A, which 
occupies the first fifteen or twenty minutes of lesson 
B; this is performed by one or two boys who are 
called upon to repeat the lesson successively, or by 
the usual mode of question and answer addressed 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 51 
to any number of boys; either method can be 
adopted acording to the nature of the lesson under 
treatment. The first Persian War, for instance, 
can be repeated in sections of moderate length, 
this being a task within the compass of any average 
Third-Form boy. Such repetition, however, of the 
circumstances which led to the legislation of 
Tiberius Gracchus would scarcely be within the 
compass of an Upper-Fifth pupil ; hence, in this case, 
the master must ask questions upon the most 
important points, and secure a repetition by means 
of his questions in the following way: “‘We have 
spoken of a journey taken by Tiberius about the 
year 134 B.c. through certain districts of Italy ; what 
special facts did he notice ? what conclusions did 
he draw from them ? what earlier law dealt with the 
distribution of land to plebeians who had none ? 
by whom were the legislative proposals of Tiberius 
opposed, and for what reason ?” ete. The second 
mode of revision consists in the repetition of a 
longer period than has been already gone through 
by the methods explained ; instances will be from 
500 to 431 B.c. in Greek history, and from 264 to 
- 133 B.c. in Roman history. This repetition takes 
p.ace at the conclusion of each period in the text- 
book, so that a pupil who works intelligently and 
looks before him can prepare for this coming 
revision of the whole period. It is probable, 
discounting the differences between lessons and 
teachers, that a considerable number make use of 
this method. 
| 4—2
-P-A-G-E-74
  52 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
At this point we must consider the second im- 
portant object of historical teaching—the power of 
making some elementary use of the matter that has 
been learnt. By this I mean the capacity to repro- 
duce acquired information in another connexion than 
that in which it was originally explained; for instance, 
a master (in the higher stages), when the pupil has 
finished the historical course, may ask questions upon 
the history of Sicily or Spain, or upon any other 
general fact of importance (of this method we shall 
speak later), and arrange his questions from this 
point of view. This is a problem which naturally 
occurs at every successive stage of instruction. In 
Prussia and elsewhere a very simple means has been 
found of discovering how far this problem has been 
solved, and the object of the pupils attained, the 
means being the oral history examination in the 
school-leaving certificate. This method is now a 
thing of the past; here, as everywhere, reform 
has thrown the handle after the helve, and the 
practice has been abolished together with its 
misuse. The problem, however, remains, and this 
method must be begun even in the Third Form. 
Use and application of the material learnt must 
then be made, because such method forms en 
essential element in every reasonable scheme of 
historical teaching. As the method is possible it 
should certainly be practised; in the First and 
Second Forms it is impossible, and for that reason 
historical teaching in the proper sense of the term 
is equally an impossibility in those forms. Revision 
i rt
-P-A-G-E-75
INTERMEDIATE STAGE 53 
of this kind, however, is a severe test of the teacher’s 
capacity. The task, as such, is sufficiently simple. 
For instance, the period of Roman history between 
264 and 146 B.c. may be repeated as a biography of 
Hannibal or of the elder Scipio. These biographies 
can be built up by question and answer from the 
material which the Third-Form boy has garnered 
through the previous ten or twelve lessons extending 
over a month or six weeks; by learning some 
twenty-six dates he has secured a chronological 
grasp of this period immediately before the revision 
of it, which revision, be it observed, should not, 
and does not, require much more than an hour’s 
time even by the method proposed. It is obviously 
at this point that the biographical thread of con- 
nexion can be made highly useful ; it is, moreover, 
the natural method to extract the biographies of 
important men from the national history, as against 
the reverse method which subordinates a national 
history to the biographies of its leading men; no 
one is acquainted with a town if he has merely 
observed the statues of its greatest citizens. There 
are, however, many other obvious lines of procedure ; 
for instance, towards the close of the course a con- 
nected history may be demanded of some special 
district of Upper Italy, Sicily, Spain, Boeotia, or 
Messenia. It may also be added that from this point 
of view the historical instruction provides a fertile 
source of material for elementary German com- 
position, which begins at this stage, as does all 
connected work. An average Third-Form boy is well 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  54 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
able to cope with such a task as the production of a 
short history of the district of Messenia, for which 
purpose he may be given numbered references to 
his text-book; a similar subject is the town of 
Thebes, founded by Cadmus, according to legend, 
and destroyed by Alexander the Great. It must, 
however, be observed that we are not here proposing 
one of the so-called minor elaborations of the 
Prussian syllabus, the arrangement of which has 
again pushed a good idea into extravagance ; nor, 
again, are we proposing any additional object for the 
pursuit of the history teacher ; we suggest nothing 
more than a subject for an essay. It is not our 
object to add to historical teaching, as such, any 
additional tasks or extensions, but quietly to proceed 
along the straightforward path which we have 
indicated. 
The path, however, must be traversed to its end. 
This is a duty as important as it is difficult to fulfil, 
because it is to some extent dependent upon adventi- 
tious circumstances ; nevertheless, the appointed 
period must be fully covered and thoroughly ex- 
hausted. University professors, as every one knows, 
are, as a whole, but little troubled by this require- 
ment; any general criticism on this account will be 
unjustifiable in their case, and if the instruction they 
find time to give bears good fruit the shortness of the 
period covered does not matter; secondary school- 
masters, however, are under different laws, and 
cannot allow themselves such licence in this matter. 
The history teacher must, therefore, from time to
-P-A-G-E-77
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 55 
time, consider the speed of his progress throughout 
the given course and must not delay, that he may 
not have to hurry towards the conclusion. While 
omitting nothing in the text-book, there is much that 
he can treat summarily, so that he can eventually 
reach the actual conclusion of the text-book, and 
leave upon the pupil’s mind the impression of a task 
accomplished, a result by no means indifferent to any 
who regard instruction as a truly educative process. 
At every stage, and not merely when teaching a 
Third Form, this duty must be seriously considered, 
if only for the simple reason that it is difficult to 
perform. ‘The inexperienced teacher is easily left 
behind from ignorance of the technical methods 
advisable in this case ; the more experienced teacher 
can make the same mistake for another reason ; the 
richer his knowledge of the subject or of special 
departments of it, the more will he have to tell his 
pupils of interest, and it is hard to renounce these 
opportunities. In many discussions upon historical 
teaching one would think that theorists had forgotten 
that the day on our planet contains but twenty-four 
hours, and the year but three hundred and sixty- 
five days—a large number of which, moreover, are 
Sundays and holidays. 
The difference between the classical and the modern 
school is of comparatively minor importance for 
this elementary and early instruction in ancient 
history. The pupils of the modern school will 
appreciate the world of ancient history less readily 
than the Third-Form boy in the classical school,
-P-A-G-E-78
56 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
who has already breathed some of its atmosphere. 
Nor is it necessary or possible that the sympathy of 
the modern school should be stronger than it is. 
Its pupils will not continue the study of history for 
itself, but only require to gain that general know- 
ledge of the subject which is advisable and necessary 
for anyone who wishes to converse with educated 
men, both for the merchant and for all members of 
the specially industrial classes. Ancient history 
need not be presented to these pupils in any different 
form from that in which the classical pupils have 
learnt it. The great struggles of the Oriental empire 
and the Greek City States in the Persian wars, the 
heroic struggle of the great nation with the great 
man in the wars with Hannibal, are no less interest- 
ing or significant to the Fourth-Form boy in the 
modern school than in the classical school ; it was 
in every respect wise for the new Prussian syllabus 
to make the historical range for these different 
schools practically coincident. A historian, how- 
ever, of university training, whose business it is to 
give this instruction in a modern school, will find a 
special attraction in introducing the events, the 
conditions, and the personalities of Greek and Roman 
history to boys who will never be impressed by that 
immediate contact with these peoples which alone 
can be gained by a knowledge of their languages. 
Hence this instruction requires no special art, but 
merely careful observation of the ideas which the 
teacher proposes to present to his pupils. 
   
-P-A-G-E-79
    INTERMEDIATE STAGE 57 
FourtH Form. 
The periods assigned to this stage of instruction 
are by no means identical throughout Germany ; 
for instance, the Saxon syllabus of 1893 assigns to 
the Lower Fourth the outlines of German history from 
1648 to 1871,and to the Upper Fourth the first portion 
of ancient history and Greek history to the death of 
Alexander the Great. The Prussian syllabus of 1901 
prescribes German history to 1740 for a course of 
two years, and this we propose to make the basis of 
our present discussion ; it is not only the most recent 
decision, but has been made after deep consideration 
of every problem involved. As our task is primarily 
practical, we do not propose to utter any criticism 
of the syllabuses in force in the different German 
states or elsewhere ; in any case, the essential part 
of our observations will apply, correctly or in- 
correctly, to the several Forms of the school, what- 
ever the period of history assigned for study. 
First and foremost the teacher must gain a clear 
idea of the general character of the Form with which 
he has to deal. Fourth Forms are composed of 
boys between twelve and fifteen years, and occasion- 
ally include backward members of some sixteen or 
seventeen years of age; this is the precocious, 
critical, and argumentative age at which, to mention 
but one symptom, argument with the teacher often 
occurs though it is hardly to be taken seriously. 
This much is certain, that at this age strong authority 
and discipline is imperatively necessary as a counter-
-P-A-G-E-80
  58 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
poise. The Form must respect, not only the master 
or the head master, of the school, but more than 
these—the moral force which support and dominate 
these personalities, as they do the pupils. Among 
these influences the sense of nationalism or 
patriotism, with possibly some small admixture of 
what is now known as Chauvinism, is a most effective 
influence, and is in many respects more strongly 
operative at this age than the influence of religious 
instruction and religious practices. Teaching, as a 
whole, must be strongly stimulative, and from every 
point of view must be directed to the task of crushing 
or counter-balancing the distraction, dilettanteism, 
and obstinacy which are characteristic of this 
age. 
Here—and unfortunately this is not the only 
place—the Prussian syllabus of 1892 seems wholly 
retrograde, and the last syllabus of 1901 has not 
entirely repaired these defects. The old Prussian 
syllabus of 1856, as far as it concerned the Fourth 
Forms in secondary schools and in deciding the two 
years’ course for these Forms, was admirable, and I 
have no hesitation in declaring it the best and most 
effective piece of educational organization with 
which I have met during the sixty years of my 
experience as teacher or learner. In this syllabus 
everything was admirably co-ordinated ; there was 
a strict basis of Latin, ten lessons with the reading 
of Cesar, to which the schoolboy of those days 
came so well prepared that he could translate at 
sight with but little help ; there was also an adequate 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 59 
amount of Greek with the reading of the Anabasis. 
Round this centre the outworks of German history | 
and German geography were arranged in a manner 
complementary and mutually supporting. The 
pupil gained increased knowledge of the history of 
his own people; the origin of it was discovered at 
the source when he met the vigorous figure of 
Ariovistus in the first book of the Bellum Gallicum ; 
the German literature taught him so much of our great 
poets and authors as to enable him to see something 
of the great mountain-tops by advancing to their feet. 
The New Testament provided religious authority, 
easily brought into connexion with a sense otf 
patriotism, and in any case favourable to a deeper 
ethical conception of history. This syllabus formed 
a central portion of the path through the secondary 
school, where abundant and simple nourishment, 
but nourishment by no means monotonous, is most 
necessary. Best of all, these studies might be made 
fruitful without any sublimated educational theory ; 
nothing more was required than such moderate 
insight and devotion to duty as is rarely lacking in 
our profession. 
This organization, in our opinion, produced 
excellent results in the generations of 1864, 1866, 
1870, and later ; it was based upon the principle that 
one subject should be learnt thoroughly, and 
acquaintance be made with many ; we refer to the 
serious and thorough linguistic training gained by 
the study of the two languages, Latin and Greek, 
which are especially suited for the acquisition of
-P-A-G-E-82
A   
60 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
such training. The basis of this organization has, 
however, been so reduced that we can no longer 
guarantee its success. The regulation which begins 
Greek at a later age is not entirely objectionable ; 
but to Latin the time given has been reduced to 
seven hours instead of the former ten, from the very 
outset in the First Form, and also in the Third and 
Fourth. We have attempted to discover some reason- 
able argument for this change without any success 
whatever. In the syllabus of 1901 an hour has been 
added in either case, the number now standing at 
eight instead of seven ; hence the existing syllabus 
in the present secondary schools is considerably 
worse than it was before ; the previous ideals have 
been retained, but the means of reaching them have 
been unduly reduced. The results will be inevitable, 
and in our special subject—the teaching of history 
in this Form—a further result has become apparent 
on one side: the Lower Fifth has been given a period of 
German history instead of a period of ancient history. 
Hence in Prussian middle schools three instead of 
two hours are now devoted to German history, upon 
which question we shall speak further when we 
discuss the Lower Fifth. 
We have now to ask what historical influence is 
exerted upon the Fourth Form by the other subjects 
there studied; natural science and mathematics 
may be left out of account. 
Turning first to the classical school, a highly 
important extension of the historical horizon takes 
place at this point for the reason that the Lower
-P-A-G-E-83
INTERMEDIATE STAGE 61 
Fourth begins the study of Greek, which exerts an 
influence even from the learning of the alphabet. 
This task is in itself a revelation to any untutored 
mind. The connexion of our script with the Greek 
is plain even to a boy of twelve years old, and if he 
is told whence the Greeks gained their alphabet, 
his attention is directed to the great civilized 
connexion which unites humanity, and a further 
impulse is given to that recognition of humanity 
as a whole which is gradually to become a living 
truth for the pupil. The first Greek words which he 
learns will forthwith display an identity with 
German and Latin, which must lead to the idea of a 
near or immediate relationship between the three 
nations ; in short, a new source of historical informa- 
tion is opened to him even before he begins the reading 
of connected texts. Inthe Upper Fourth this reading 
is confined to an historical source of first-rate value— 
the Anabasis of Xenophon. It is obvious that this 
latter advantage—to our thinking, very considerable 
—will be diminished by the reduction of the lessons 
from seven to six in the existing Prussian syllabus. 
We are delighted to observe that this dangerous 
precedent has not been followed by the Saxon 
syllabus of 1893, which seems to us to point in this 
and other cases to the more correct method, and 
to be less disturbed by educational heterodoxy. In 
this syllabus the seven hours for the Fourth and 
Fifth Forms are retained. 
In their first year the Lower-Fourth pupils have 
advanced so far in Latin that they can read Cesar’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  62 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Bellum Gallicum ; in Prussia, however, the master 
is obliged to give somewhat more help than would 
be, under other circumstances, advisable. It would 
be superfluous to speak at greater length of the 
importance of this author to historical teaching, 
and to the historical education of the pupils, not- 
withstanding the fact that many people and many 
teachers seem to confine the word history to that 
side of historical instruction which concerns the 
memory alone. History to them implies the tables 
or summaries, or the amount of so-called positive 
knowledge contained in histories of the world in 
twelve, eighteen, or twenty volumes ; they consider 
that this is the kind of positive knowledge that we 
wish to draw from the reading of Latin and Greek 
texts. Our view, however, is very different. To 
understand the past in any degree implies the 
capacity of realizing it as a present ; we insist that 
any one incapable of this effort is equally incapable 
of relating the history of any one period or nation ; 
hence, as regards our share in secondary education, 
we may also say that pupils learn real history only 
so far as they develop this capacity of using their 
imaginative powers and realizing the past as present. 
We have already seen that in the elementary stages 
this process of realization is confined to simple 
language and short sentences; as the knowledge of 
the foreign language improves, the power of realiza- 
tion increases, and can or should be powerfully 
operative during the reading of Cesar’s bellum 
Gallicum, provided that the master has a moderate
-P-A-G-E-85
    INTERMEDIATE STAGE 63 
knowledge of his business. Czesar’s book is an his- 
torical source of first-rate importance, by which we 
mean that the writer relates his own experiences, 
reproduces the past as present in action ; this task, 
again, is performed by a man of high intellect, 
who was himself the author and overseer of the 
events which he narrates. It is thus obvious that 
when the pupil prepares, translates, or revises this 
book, when he reads this author thoughtfully, he 
experiences the contents of the book so far as it is 
possible in any way to experience the past. Only 
thus will historical events become living realities to 
the pupil. Take, for instance, chapters xxxi. to 
liv. of the first book, the history of the first or 
second great conflict between the Roman and the 
Teutonic world, between Ceasar and Ariovistus ; 
however wooden the teaching or however stupid 
the pupil, some realization of the important historical 
position must be secured ; the pupil cannot fail to 
realize the special position of Gaul, a civilization 
comparatively advanced and menaced by two more 
powerful but less civilized nationalities, a country, 
moreover, by no means united; then comes the 
personality of an interesting barbarian chief: the 
scene (Book I., chapter xxxii.) played before 
Cesar by those genuine Gauls and genuine French- 
men, the Sequani; the origin of the first conflict 
between the Roman and Teutonic nationalities, 
two powers incarnated in two pre-eminent figures— 
those of Cesar and Ariovistus—holds the imagina- 
tion of a boy of fourteen years; then follow the
-P-A-G-E-86
  64 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
negotiations between these leaders, the panic of an 
excellent army caused by the vague fears which 
even the boldest spirits feel before an unknown foe 
of infinite ferocity; the moral influence of one 
great man over an army is seen, and something is 
learnt of the army until we reach the intensely 
interesting meeting of the two leaders, at which 
point a competent teacher will not hesitate to show 
how the chapter is one of the most precious passages 
in Roman literature for German readers, because it 
is the first long and serious speech of a famous 
Teuton, who is, so to speak, a German, bone of our 
bone, and flesh of our flesh, while that speech is 
here reported with full reliability. Pages might be 
filled with explanations of the historical principles 
contained within these chapters, and available even 
for the intellect of boyhood. The pupil reads the 
lives of men and nations, and while reading is not 
merely a listener, but can appropriate views, con- 
ceptions, and real knowledge by slowly grasping 
these views as represented in words, and piercing 
through the veil of words to the reality beneath. 
These influences cannot be measured or precisely | 
determined, but they are immediate, and certainly 
belong to the sphere of historical instruction ; hence 
the young teacher must understand that here he 
has an opportunity with little trouble, and without 
calling into play the famous six interests, to produce 
an extraordinary result by simple attention to 
business. These results are not likely to be recog- 
nized by the newspaper, by the public, or even by
-P-A-G-E-87
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 65 
educational authorities,let alone the daily press or the 
party continually tinkering with reform; but, none 
the less, they stand written in the Book of Life. 
Of the rest of the further Latin instruction given 
at this stage, and in particular of translation from 
German into Latin, we shall say nothing, and shall 
touch the matter with great brevity even when we 
deal with the Sixth Form. The leaders of modern 
educational tendencies in Germany, whose words 
seem almost to bear an official character, are appar- 
ently unable to appreciate the intimate connexion 
between the reading of Latin texts and the attempt 
to think in the language of these texts when such 
thinking is not mere retranslation or paraphrase. It 
does not seem to be understood that the full benefit 
of Latin study, and therefore the historical benefit, 
can only be secured when both modes of transla- 
tion are practised so that the one supplements and 
completes the other. 
The greater part of what we have said is equally 
true of Greek; the reading of the first book of 
Xenophon’s Anabasis begins, at any rate, during 
the second half-yearin the Upper Fourth. This book 
provides a highly effective and educational counter- 
part and counterpoise to the reading of Cesar; the 
resulting advantages are naturally doubled if the 
study of the Greek text is treated, like that of the 
Latin, with full reference to the matter as well as 
to the language. Here it must be observed that the 
simultaneous study of the two classical languages, 
when the intellect and the power of concentration 
5
-P-A-G-E-88
  66 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
have so developed as to undertake this task, produces 
an advantage which cannot be expressed by a simple 
sum in addition. Moreover, it is high time to 
appreciate the fact that Greek and Roman authors 
are now read in our schools from a historical point 
of view, and that they therefore mean a great deal 
more to us than they did to our predecessors of the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The method 
of treatment which regards the Bellum Gallicum or 
the Anabasis as original sources, and as documents 
interesting for their actuality, is by no means as 
yet universally employed ; classical scholars pure 
and simple still show some objection to the method, 
in fear, [ suppose, that grammatical accuracy may 
suffer from it. Provided that modern barbarism 
does not succeed in totally abolishing Greek, it will 
be recognized by degrees that grammatical accuracy 
is in no way benefited merely because it is allowed 
to overshadow historical content; the two sides 
react upon and illuminate one another, and it costs 
no more time to read these texts as monuments of 
national history than was formerly expended in 
reading them for their grammar and their style. 
It may also be pointed out that such treatment of 
texts is best calculated to emphasize a very essential 
part of historical life—namely, the coexistence and 
interaction of great and small, of lofty and trivial 
events. Much can be done, for instance, for a 
Fourth-Form boy’s historical knowledge and _ his- 
torical outlook in such a case as the first book of 
the Anabasis, chapter vii., section 3. Cyrus, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 67 
far-sighted barbarian prince and the chief figure of 
the narrative, is there represented as reminding the 
Strategi and Lochagi of his mercenary regiment, 
of their Greek Eleutheria ; this was a privilege, as he 
clearly explains, from which he was excluded, and 
which none the less made these Greek mercenaries 
superior in power to ten times their number of bar- 
barians. Here we have that same influence of 
liberty which is hereafter to fortify also the present 
Fourth-Form boy; at the same time the value of 
this reading is highly stimulating to the historical 
knowledge of even very simple and elementary 
facts, such as the daily life of an army on march. 
Here the master is able in every case to arouse a 
technical interest in a very simple way which 
directly furthers linguistic interest; he may, for 
instance, ask the form to collect.the military and 
strategical terms with which they meet as they 
read the first book of the Anabasis, and the same 
process is naturally possible in the reading of Cesar. 
No modern language can supply any similar means 
of stimulating the historical sense, and certainly not 
French, which is not studied for this purpose. In 
the modern schools the more numerous hours 
devoted to French and its connexion with English 
make it possible to do something for the extension 
of the historical outlook upon the lines by which 
Latin and Greek influence the pupils of the classical 
schools ; the effect, however, is not great, nor does 
the modern school aim directly at this object. 
Text-books in this language are concerned, as they 
5—2
-P-A-G-E-90
  68 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
should be, with modern or, at most, with medieval 
life. At this stage we shall expect to find but 
scanty classical references in the French reading- 
book. Greek and Roman history in a French dress, 
even when handled not merely by Rollin or Chateau- 
briand, but also by Michelet and Guizot, appear 
somewhat alien to the pupil of the classical school, 
and in many cases produce a kind of unjustifiable 
repugnance to French. The difference between the 
French and German spirit is strongly present to the 
pupil’s consciousness at this stage, and the French 
master is here confronted by the additional obstacle 
of a certain Chauvinism, when he emphasizes the 
fine points of the French language and the French 
spirit. Further progress in French certainly fosters 
the historical sense, though not immediately, by 
extending the point of outlook, by inducing com- 
parison with a foreign nationalism, and by opposing 
modernity to antiquity. The educational value of 
French is not to be under-estimated when properly 
taught, but the study is certainly intended for some- 
thing better than to enable the pupils to converse 
about a journey from Berlin to Potsdam, or from 
Mayence to Cologne, or upon the bill of fare in a 
restaurant. 
Of special importance in the Upper and Lower 
Fourth, for the stimulus of the historical sense, is the 
study of German; we refer particularly to the 
German reading-book, which eventually extends to 
the reading of dramatic pieces, the dramas of 
Uhland, the pieces of Herzog Ernst, Korner’s
-P-A-G-E-91
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 69 
Zriny, Kleist’s Prinz von Homburg, and also 
Goethe’s Gotz von Berlichingen, the hard realism of 
which seems almost to have been intended for the 
benefit of this stage (the Upper Fourth), and Schiller’s 
Tell, though this latter seems hardly suitable as yet. 
We cannot agree with the usual phrase that German 
ought to form the central point of the whole educa- 
tional course; we might as well say that the air 
we breathe forms the central point of our life. 
German is therefore much more than the central 
point ; at present, however, we are speaking of 
systematic lessons, and especially of the reading 
lessons. The reading-book leads the boy deep into 
the life of our nation, and this seems to be the 
proper stage to begin the old Scandinavian or 
medieval German legendary poetry ; anything, in 
fact, may be used which is a special product of 
the imagination, even “‘ Reinecke Fuchs” (Reynard 
the Fox) or “‘ Eulenspiegel ’’ (Owl Glass). By reading 
the modern extracts the pupil learns something 
of the lives of their authors, and gains a nearer 
acquaintance with the great literary revival subse- 
quent to 1748 and with its leading figures, Goethe 
and Schiller. The original Prussian syllabus for 
these Forms, that antecedent to 1882, 1892, and 1901 
was a masterpiece, and it has remained compara- 
tively unimpaired in this respect; we mean that 
German history receives adequate attention in this 
Form, and should react upon the study of the German 
language and literature, an interaction which is not 
only advisable upon educational grounds, but is
-P-A-G-E-92
70 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY | 
almost automatically and naturally provided, though 
cases do arise when the German and the history 
lessons are in the hands of different masters. The 
German lesson, more than any other, depends upon 
the master’s individuality, his inclinations, his 
studies, and the range of his reading. It is obvious 
that his teaching may be good or bad by methods 
wholly different in either case ; we would not be mis- 
understood to assert that a teacher who is inclined to 
praise the historical point of view should be forced 
to make a direct connexion between German 
literature and German history ; for instance, if he 
reads Charles the Great in a history lesson, he need 
not necessarily proceed to read with his Form every 
legend and poem in the reading-book which may 
refer to this hero. We entirely reject the view that 
these so-called historical poems should be imme- 
diately and systematically incorporated in the history 
lessons ; this is anything but the co-ordination of 
teaching, and tends rather to distract than to 
concentrate the attention; nor is it in any way 
necessary. We consider that the German literature 
lessons do much to further the historical sense by 
introducing the pupils to fresh views of human life 
conceived from different points of view; these 
lessons introduce the pupils to German legends, to 
the best German prose, to the noblest of German 
poetry, and thus provide him with some idea of our 
national importance in the development of humanity. 
The connecting-links are made automatically by 
instruction in German history, and a sense of 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 71 
nationalism is thereby stimulated. Neither in 
literary nor in history lessons do we require any 
party-pleading ; the master should be himself so 
patriotic, and inspired by so true a love of his country, 
as to be unconscious of the fact ; in that case the 
pupils will be most likely to catch something of his 
spirit, and a stage will possibly be reached when it 
is not necessary to accompany every word with the 
adjective “national.” 
Religious instruction exerts an influence upon the 
fundamental historical conceptions very analogous 
to that of the literature lessons. The connexion 
between divinity and history as subjects of teaching 
has been already indicated in discussing the earlier 
stages ; for the Upper and Lower Fourth we should 
prefer to confine ourselves to the reading of the 
New Testament, in opposition to the Prussian 
syllabuses of 1892, and 1901 and to some others which 
do not seem to consider sufficiently the psychological 
conditions which govern the work of the different 
Forms. At this stage we should take as our texts 
the New Testament and some of the Psalms, 
or use a suitable series of extracts from the Bible, 
like the so-called school Bible of Bremen. The first 
year would be devoted to the life of Jesus as given 
in the synoptic Gospels, and the second year to the 
growth of the Christian community—that is, of the 
apostolic age. The conditions are the same as 
those which apply to the First and Second Forms ; 
in proportion as the instruction satisfies religious 
interests and requirements, so will it improve the
-P-A-G-E-94
  72 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
historical sense of the pupil, and enable him to take 
a deeper and more serious view of human life as 
a whole; in proportion as the master emphasizes 
the historical, actual, and vivid side of his divinity 
lessons, so will he stimulate the development of the. 
religious sense. The conception of humanity asja 
whole is a religious idea, as we have said, a belief 
that necessarily presupposes the existence of God. 
This belief must be reality to anyone who wishes to 
learn how to study history, and during the two years 
that are spent in the Fourth Form much can be done 
toward the attainment of this object. 
We now turn from side influences to the main 
stream—to historical instruction as such. Here we 
have to consider history and geography in connexion. 
Such is the method of the Prussian syllabus, an 
example generally followed elsewhere, at any rate 
as regards the general scheme of studies printed at 
the beginning of the syllabuses. It must be said that 
the Prussian syllabus carefully avoids the usual line 
of connexion in this general scheme in order to spare 
the feelings of geographers, so that geography 
retains an apparent independence. The fact is 
undoubted that if German history is appointed for 
the Fourth Form, and the geography of Europe apart 
from Germany for the Third Form, then the only 
possible geography for the Fourth is that of Germany. 
We do not quite understand the regulations of the 
Prussian syllabus of 1892 with reference to what is 
known as physical geography. This syllabus pro- 
vided for the Lower Fourth “revision of the political
-P-A-G-E-95
INTERMEDIATE STAGE 73 
_ geography of Germany,” and for the Upper Fourth 
‘revision of the physical geography of Germany ; ” 
here there seems to be a mistake or a misprint. It 
is obvious that the reverse order is the more natural ; 
political geography can be the more advantageously 
revised the better the pupil knows the history of a 
country, and should, for similar reasons, be preceded 
by the physical geography of acountry. This, there- 
fore, must be assigned to the Lower Fourth. Of 
** revision ’’ there will not be much, for, as we have 
observed, comparatively little is learnt and less 
retained in the Second Form; hence the study must 
be begun practically from the outset. The Prussian 
syllabus also added: for the Lower Fourth the 
physical and political geography of the non- 
European continents, with the exception of the 
jJerman colonies ; for the Upper Fourth the physical 
geography of the German colonies. Thus the main 
subject of study is that of the continents and German 
colonies outside of Europe. This latter point, the 
study of the colonies, may be accomplished by a 
Fourth-Form boy in two or three lessons, and we are 
therefore unable to understand why it should be 
made the main subject for the Upper Fourth and put 
down as an appendix to the physical geography of 
Germany. The whole regulation is unintelligible, 
and must be altered if confusion is to be avoided ; 
we are fully convinced that these alterations will be 
automatic, and that the physical and_ political 
geography of the German Empire will be the subject 
for the two years’ course of the Fourth Form. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
74 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
subject will necessarily imply a discussion of the 
German colonies, which is not likely to be of much 
value without a revision of the physical and political 
geography of the non-European continents, with 
which the pupil first became acquainted in the First 
and Second Forms. The syllabus of 1901 has thus 
materially modified these regulations. The subject 
for the Lower Fourth there appears as “‘ geography 
of the non-European continents—the German 
colonies,’ while the subject for the Upper Fourth is 
“revision and completion of the geography of the 
German Empire.” We prefer to reverse this order, 
and to give the geography of the German Empire 
eighteen months of the two years at our disposal, 
leaving the geography of the other continents for 
the last six months in the Upper Fourth. It is un- 
necessary to point out how closely history and 
geography are connected at this stage, but the con- 
nexion can be made too close. The best theoretical 
arrangement, and one that has been introduced by 
competent teachers, would be the following : 
First Year.—Introduction (for the whole of the 
three lessons) ; physical geography of Germany and 
German history until 1648 (also for the three 
lessons). 
Second Year.—Introductory ; history of Branden- 
burg-Prussia until 1648; German history to 1871, 
concluding with the political geography of Germany 
(throughout the three lessons a week). 
This would be our arrangement if we were dealing 
with the study of our own country with four hours 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 75 
a week at our disposal in a university course ; but 
it is not an arrangement to be recommended for 
schools. Here we have to distinguish an arrange- 
ment based upon three lessons a week, or two lessons 
out of four in modern schools, as two lessons are 
there devoted to continuous and connected geo- 
graphical instruction; generally speaking, in our 
arrangement the Lower Fourth will deal with physical 
and the Upper Fourth with political geography. For 
pure historical teaching two lessons a week then 
remain throughout the two years. 
Before the year 1892 these two years were arranged 
as follows in Prussia: The Lower Fourth studied 
medieval history from about a.D. 476 to 1517, and 
modern history from 1517 to 1648 ; the Upper Fourth 
studied the outlines of the history of Brandenburg- 
Prussia until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, and 
then the history of the last two hundred and fifty 
years in greater detail. Where this arrangement is 
in force, and German history is confined to a two 
years’ course in the middle stages, medieval history 
must be greatly condensed. We would, however, 
expressly insist that the history of Brandenburg- 
Prussia until 1648 should be treated in Saxon, 
Bavarian, and Wurtemberg schools precisely as it 
is in Prussian schools ; it may be added that this 
view was unanimously approved at the Berlin con- 
ference of 1873. The syllabus of 1892, however, in 
Prussia abolished ancient history for the Lower Fifth, 
and devoted this year to German history, so that by 
the syllabus of 1901 the arrangement is as follows:
-P-A-G-E-98
  76 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
First Year (Lower Fourth).—German history to 
1517 (medieval). 
Second Year (Upper Fourth).—From 1517 to 1740. 
Third Year (Lower Fifth).—From 1740 to 1871 (or 
1888). 
We shall make this arrangement our basis, but 
our remarks will apply particularly to the Lower 
Fifth. 
It is an arrangement which enables us to work 
through a comparatively detailed account of early 
and medieval German history with the Lower Fourth. 
At the same time the teacher must make his 
arrangements beforehand, and decide which portions 
he will treat in full detail, and in which he will 
confine himself to the most essential facts. Here, 
again, we have to distinguish between the parts 
played by the text-book, by the teacher’s lecture, 
and by revision. 
As regards the text-book, our previous remarks 
are again applicable. It must be in simple language, 
and deal with actual facts in a business-like manner ; 
at the same time it must not be dry, and least of all 
wearisome. Very many of our text-books strike 
an unfortunate middle course between the chronicle 
and the reading-book style of narrative, which is 
diversified by occasional lapses into patriotic or 
moral reflections ; their sole object is to subserve the 
task of revision and of imprinting facts upon the 
memory ; the text-book should help the student 
during the lesson, and should be gradually worked 
through at home in constant connexion with Form
-P-A-G-E-99
    INTERMEDIATE STAGE 77 
teaching. Above all things it must give accurate 
dates and plenty of them. At this stage it is of 
high importance, and is, in our experience, a task 
constantly neglected, to stimulate the chronological 
sense, and to induce the habit of regarding dates 
as something more than mere figures. For this 
purpose the text-book must provide all material, 
and at this stage, again, chronological tables in 
addition to the text-book are to be rejected. 
Superfluous also is a historical school atlas, though 
good and cheap books of the kind are to be had (for 
instance, Putzger). In any case we do not regard 
such atlases as particularly useful during secondary 
school instruction. For the first year in the Fourth 
all that is required is a good wall-map of Europe ; 
a physical map marking the most important names 
is quite adequate. The pupil requires nothing more 
for the illustration of the master’s narrative com- 
mentary. Meanwhile the question arises whether 
at this stage the pupil could or should learn to use 
his imagination for translating the map of modern 
Germany, which he has in his school atlas, into the 
map of Germany as it was in 1815 or in 1740; it 
must be observed, and is constantly forgotten, that 
he does not yet possess this power, which ought to be 
acquired by degrees. We have every respect for the 
objective method, but it is possible to have too much 
of a good thing, and on this subject we shall speak 
further. The use of the text-book will not differ 
materially from that which obtains with the Third 
Form. A section of the text-book will be read aloud
-P-A-G-E-100
78 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
at this stage by one pupil alone; one such reading 
will be sufficient. The master then goes through the 
narrative with all the stimulating detail that his 
dexterity and knowledge of the subject will allow 
him to introduce. The section or sections that have 
been thus worked through in form will then be read 
by the pupil at home. He will learn the facts so 
that he can repeat them when questioned by the 
master in the following lesson. At this stage the 
use of note-books is not advisable. The text-book 
for the Fourth Form will naturally be somewhat more 
elaborate than that for the Third. In the case of 
the Third-Form book every period is divided into 
individual and self-contained stories; in the Fourth 
Form the text-book is divided into sections in accord- 
ance with the facts, for the reason that here the first 
principles of arrangement begin to dawn upon the 
pupil. It must also be noticed that at this stage 
the teacher may handle the text-book with greater 
freedom ; it is not necessary that every section 
should be read aloud before he discusses it in detail, 
though we considered that this method was generally 
advisable for the Third Form. He may begin with 
his narrative lecture, and attempt to realize the 
lofty phrase which would have him present every 
event and character before the pupil’s very eyes ; 
then the section in the text-book may be read aloud 
as a summary of what has been said, after which he 
may proceed by the same method. It is the master 
and his commentary which decide the character 
of a lesson, and not the text-book. The text-
-P-A-G-E-101
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 79 
book is not on that account superfluous, and 
should not be reduced to a secondary position, 
but at the same time must play its own part and 
no other. 
Every possible talent may easily be demanded 
for the master who gives a historical lecture to the 
Fourth Form ; this lecture or commentary is, in its 
own way, even more difficult than university 
lecturing. One virtue, however, of all others it 
must have, a virtue that is common to university or 
any other kind of historical lecturing, and this is a 
stern respect for truth. The Alpha and Omega of 
historical teaching is that facts should be explained, 
not only because they have happened, but also as 
they have happened. With this Form we are 
working upon the history of our own nation ; our 
country is the object of study, and many teachers 
accordingly think that a pathetic tone is demanded. 
‘“* Rejoice, German youths, with a thankful heart 
for thy dear fatherland! For to thee has been 
granted what long was the warm and pious wish 
of thy fathers—the German Empire of unity and 
yet of inward diversity and of power beyond its 
frontiers, the abiding-place of peace and morality for 
the peoples of the earth!’ Such is the opening 
sentence of an Historical Teat-book and Reading-book 
from the Age of Charles the Great to the Present 
Time. Class-room explanation of this kind is indeed 
magnificent, but we doubt whether it produces 
much patriotism ; this result is less likely for the 
reason that “thy fathers’? by no means so uni-
-P-A-G-E-102
  80 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
versally cherished this warm desire ; indeed, a con- 
siderable proportion of them raised the most violent 
opposition to this course of development. Even if 
patriotism could be thus inspired we should be 
sorry to rely upon any so produced. The master 
who really feels the seriousness of so great a national 
life as ours will doubtless in his heart be delighted 
that he can play a modest but important part in 
this great work. He will emphasize with readiness 
and preference the fine, the great, and the capable 
elements of our national history, but he will not 
venture to be silent upon stories of oppression, 
duplicity, and barbarity, were they ten times more 
German than they are. For instance, under the 
influence of Burschenschaft Teutonism historians 
delighted to represent our forefathers as the quin- 
tessence of uprightness and excellence. The state- 
ment is unpatriotic because it is not true. It is 
permissible to praise the primitive Teutons, and to 
grant them all that Tacitus, who idealized them, 
has said by way of contrast to the vices of a decadent 
civilization. At the same time even the Fourth-Form 
boy must be informed that, like other barbarians, 
they had some of the vices of barbarism. There 
was the revengeful cruelty of which Tacitus speaks 
(Annals, i. 61) in describing the discoveries on the 
battle-field where Varus was defeated; they had 
also the same lack of straightforwardness as is 
related by Velleius Paterculus (ii. 118) in reference 
to the disaster of Varus: At illi, quod nisi expertus 
(as he himself was) via credat, in summa feritate
-P-A-G-E-103
    INTERMEDIATE STAGE 81 
versutissimi natumque mendacio genus, simulantes 
fictas litium series et nunc provocantes alter alterwm 
injuria, nunc agentes gratias, quod ea Romana justitia 
finiret feritasque sua novitate incognite drscipline 
mitesceret et solita armis discernt jure terminarentur, 
in summam socordiam perduxere Quintiliwm. This 
mode of procedure is often represented as highly 
praiseworthy strategy in the fine colouring of 
patriotism, even as many text-books have found it 
possible to assure our youths that Frederick the 
Great was really a sound Christian. Ido not know 
whether it is quite true that our nation is free from 
national pride, but I do know that a healthy nation 
or an intelligent man must be able to endure the 
truth. One method, and perhaps the most effective, 
of telling a nation the truth is that instruction in 
national history which the master gives to youth in 
Forms under his care. 
We must now recognize the further advantage 
that for this Form, the Lower Fourth, we have to 
deal with the so-called Middle Ages. In this period 
the figures, the institutions, and the important 
events have a certain romantic attraction, especially 
for boyhood, when a capacity for gaining a vivid 
realization of these times is either wanting or is 
insufficiently acute. The fact is especially true, 
for example, of the royal figures of Conrad I., of 
-Otto II. and Otto III., and to some extent of 
the Hohenstaufen. The picture will be strongly 
idealized because the details of its past are very 
alien to ourselves, and transmitted by chroniciers 
6 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  82 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
of very defective capacity. Mature minds are in 
little better case even after reading the original 
sources, or a narrative so detailed as the seven 
volumes of Giesebrecht. In any case it is the per- 
_sonal element that is most easily realized, and this 
must therefore be made prominent. We refer to the 
personal and not to the biographical element, and, 
so far as is permitted by the course of events and by 
the circumstantial details to be worked into the 
narrative, we should advise the teacher to rely upon 
a choice of definite characters, and to make them as 
realistic as possible by this method. At this stage 
the master must clearly understand the necessity of 
abandoning the ordinary uniform method of treat- 
ment, for the reason that the historical material at 
his disposal is too extensive. He must clearly and 
carefully distinguish between the narrative of his- 
torical fact, which fact will be divided into the 
clearest possible sections, and the narrative dealing 
with the manner of the fact ; this will be related upon 
broader lines with as much characteristic detail as the 
scanty time allotted permits. Instances of the first 
division are the whole period until A.D. 476, the early 
history of Rome and the Teutonic world; here full 
narratives can be given of the first conflicts between 
Varus and Arminius, between Arminius and his 
brother Flavius (Tacitus, Annals, ii. 9, 10). Later, 
only special details can be given ; for instance, the 
character of Attila, as derived from the impressions 
of eyewitnesses, such as the Greek Priscus at his 
embassy in 446; Theoderich and Chlodovech can be 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 83 
individualized only to a moderate extent ; the figure 
of Charles the Great can be depicted more easily 
and with greater detail. This latter figure can be 
made the subject of three or four narrative lessons, 
as warrior, conqueror, restorer of the Imperium 
Romanum, and as ruler, as the zealous and self- 
taught prince who eagerly fostered education, trade, 
and civilization. Here an opportunity arises for 
introducing some points with reference to the 
history of civilization ; something can be done after 
the style of Guizot in the twentieth lesson of his 
Histoire de la Civilisation en France, where he deals 
with Hincmar in order to give the pupil an idea of 
the conduct of business in the assemblies of Charles 
the Great, and of the general duties of his Missi. 
On the other hand, the whole period from 814 to 
911, or even to 936, and the reigns of Otto IT. and 
IIT., cannot be explained continuously ; some leading 
tendencies and facts with other landmarks of the kind 
can be given, and a character briefly sketched here 
and there as occasion arises. The First, and cer- 
tainly the Third Crusade can be fully detailed, but 
of the other Crusades only the main outlines can be 
given. In this case we do not propose any attempt 
to exhaust the whole of the allotted period. It is 
obvious that considerable liberty of choice is here 
left to the master, and that the better he knows his 
subject, the better he will select points for special 
treatment ; in this power of independent choice 
much of his skill and capacity as a_ historical 
teacher lies. We need not discuss the point further, 
6—2
-P-A-G-E-106
    84 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
and will only refer to some special difficulties which 
arise in dealing with medieval history in a Lower- 
Fourth Form. 
The first difficulty is also one that affects the 
subject-matter allotted to the succeeding Form, and 
it is this: notwithstanding the wealth of our his- 
torical literature and the numerous German histories 
of every kind and length, we have as yet no suitable 
book. <A book in two or three volumes is required 
which will provide the master who has to teach 
this period to the rising generation at once with the 
substance of what he has to say and an example of 
the manner in which it should be said. The fact is 
not surprising. Such a narrative would be far harder 
to write in this case than in the case of any other 
nation, with the possible exception of Italian history. 
We shall not be far wrong in saying that it was only 
a short time ago, in 1870 and 1871, that the most 
important preliminary work for the writing of such 
a book was performed ; other learned preliminary 
monographs are still in progress, and prove, as in 
the case of true historical investigators, that religious 
or party prejudices form no obstacle to the com- 
position of a truly national narrative. A case in 
point is the excellent work of Moritz Ritter, which 
deals with a period exceedingly difficult to handle 
for secondary schools (1555-1648).* There is thus 
here a great deficiency to be made good, and mean- 
* Deutsche Geschichte, 1555-1648, vol. i, Stuttgart, 1889; 
vol. ii., 1895. The first half of vol. iii. (to 1625) appeared in 
1901. The remaining half is expected shortly. 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 85 
while the teacher must use such helps as he can find ; 
these, at any rate where he is a beginner, will show 
him the amount and extent of the detail to be 
employed, and this is no small service. If he be 
entrusted with a section of historical teaching for 
any length of time, he will be obliged by degrees 
to read a number of special histories, and also to 
take from the school library, at first for his own 
instruction, the German translations of the original 
authorities for the Middle Ages. 
A second difficulty is the fact that ecclesiastical 
and dogmatic considerations, of which the Fourth- 
Form boy knows very little, play so important a 
part in medieval history. The pupil does not as 
yet understand the fierce animosity that arose on 
dogmatic points upon the coexistence of the two 
natures in Christ, upon the procession of the Holy 
Ghost in opoovovs or opoovc.os, upon Arianism, 
Athanasianism, etc. The whole limit of ideas 
which dominated medieval humanity is totally 
unknown to the pupil, who therefore runs a danger 
which did not arise in the study of ancient history— 
the danger of gaining a wholly distorted view of 
many great and important events. It is, indeed, a 
much more difficult task to make a boy understand 
the importance of Gregory VII., Innocent III., or 
Alexander III. than of Socrates or Demosthenes, 
or even of Plato. The master, especially if he be a 
Protestant, must be careful in dealing with the 
history of Henry IV. or Frederick II. not to paint 
hierarchical greed for power in too vivid colours.
-P-A-G-E-108
  86 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
There are, however, sides of medieval life which can 
be brought closely home to the pupil’s intelligence. 
He can understand the elements of heroism, not 
merely that of chivalry, but also that of renuncia- 
tion, as it appears in the pure forms of the monastic 
system. He can understand, too, the civilizing work 
of monasticism, can appreciate figures like St. Gall 
and the battle of his Irish monks with the demons 
of the wilderness. The master therefore must resist 
the temptation, which in our days is often strong, to 
emphasize unduly the ridiculous side of medieval life 
and its unbounded credulity ; for modern rationalism 
attempts upon occasion, with refined hypocrisy, to 
represent the simple beliefs of the medieval world 
as so many attempts at self-aggrandizement. 
At certain points of Lower-Fourth instruction this 
difficulty merges into another, of which we shall 
speak later. It is a fact that the line of demarca- 
tion which has divided the German and the European 
world for some four centuries is already obvious in 
the history, for instance, of the fifteenth century, 
in the conflict between the Reformers and the Pope, 
and, on the other side, between the Reformers of the 
Council of Constance and John Huss. These diffi- 
culties, however, can be met by tact and dexterity 
on the teacher’s part. A Lower-Fourth-Form boy is 
not likely to understand the special point of the Con- 
stance tragedy, which induced the majority of the 
Council to put a Reformer to death as a heretic. He 
can, however, understand that an honourable man, 
who might have saved his life by renouncing what
-P-A-G-E-109
INTERMEDIATE STAGE 87. 
he believed to be true, preferred death to renuncia- 
tion ; he may gain a healthy horror of the disgrace 
inflicted upon the Christian religion by the practice 
de comburendo heretico, and if this horror becomes 
part of his life the consequence is but one of the 
many benefits which historical instruction can and 
sould effect. 
The difficulty becomes more obvious in the period 
covered by the Upper Fourth—the period of modern 
German history, which cannot be so easily separated 
from European history as in the case of the Lower 
Fourth. An instance is the first period from 1517 
to 1648. The difficulty consists in the fact that 
every Form is a mixture of different religious creeds 
in varying percentages—in other words, there are 
thirty-two millions of Protestants and eighteen mil- 
lions of Catholics in the German Empire, leaving the 
smaller religious bodies out of consideration. The 
problem grows more important as the upper stages 
are reached, but some discussion must be devoted 
to it at this point. We would first protest against 
one means of confronting the difficulty—the pro- 
vision of different editions of the same text-book 
for Catholic and for Evangelical schools. Such a 
proposal is almost an insult to the German secondary 
school system, and is in any case useless, as there 
are very few schools which are entirely Evangelical 
or entirely Catholic. Our systematic, or so-called 
scientific, works upon pedagogics and teaching theory 
generally seem to avoid the point ; and naturally so, 
for it is a question of practice, and does not arise in
-P-A-G-E-110
8g THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
theory. History is history for Catholic and Pro- 
testant alike. It will be also readily admitted 
that hitherto the difficulty has not appeared particu- 
larly acute. Agitation has not yet invaded this — 
sphere, and the long, persistent use of the text- 
books of Putz in many Evangelical schools, and the 
books of Herbst in many Catholic schools, shows that 
here all is peaceful as yet. It is possible that tl 2 
peace will not be of long duration, and the matter 
deserves our serious consideration from an educa- 
tional point of view and sense of duty, which we 
must carefully distinguish from the standpoint of 
school politics or from politics of any kind. Hence 
we may set down some plain rules, drawn from 
information kindly given us by Catholic and Evan- 
gelical history teachers. In the first place, the 
master must remember that his business is to relate 
history as it happened, to explain how men acted 
under the special conditions of time, place, morals, 
civilization or the want of it. It is not the master’s 
business to glorify the Catholic or Evangelical con- 
ception of Christianity; this can be left to the 
clergy or to such occasions as are not specially 
concerned with historical teaching. In the second 
place, the master must clearly distinguish in his 
mind between the idea of the Church, whether 
Catholic or Protestant, and its earthly and fallible 
servants and champions, and this distinction must 
be made plain to the pupil. In the third place, the 
Protestant history teacher who notoriously is in this 
point free and independent enough, thanks to the idea 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 89 
of the invisible Church, should lay great stress 
on such members of the Catholic Church as have 
deserved well of humanity, dwelling with no less 
emphasis upon deficiencies or failures on the Pro- 
testant side where such occur. When the persecu- 
tion of different faiths comes in question, let him 
avoid the dangerous prejudice which represents the 
Roman Church as alone guilty in this respect. The 
fact is obviously untrue, and our instruction must 
combat this sad and miserable side of human 
nature in every form, and for this purpose expose 
its misdeeds, whether they happened at Rome, 
Geneva, Dresden, or elsewhere. 
At this point we can go a step further. We reject 
every premeditated attempt to stimulate patriotism, 
but we do not wish to underrate the patriotic influ- 
ence of the study of national history, or, rather, the 
influence of the German who teaches that history. 
We have, indeed, every reason to bring this force 
into play at the present moment. The fact is 
obvious that within the last ten years there has 
been a revival of religious exclusiveness and fanati- 
cism. Some ground had been temporarily, if not 
definitely, gained, but this has once more been lost— 
let us hope, not for long. It is, therefore, a duty 
imposed on us, not by the State, by a Ministry, or 
an Educational Council, but by the genius of our 
nation and the Christian religion, to repair this 
deficiency. The work can be done quietly, with- 
out rhetorical flourish. It is necessary for the his- 
torical teacher in our secondary schools to present
-P-A-G-E-112
  90 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
the national history of the last four centuries from 
a wider point of view than that which is afforded 
to the limited vision of a definite religious party or 
creed. At the same time it must not be forgotten, 
in dealing with the Upper-Fourth Form, that our 
patriotism is not the narrow national pride of the 
Englishman or the Spaniard, nor, again, is it the 
Chauvinism of the Frenchman ; it is open-hearted 
and free, and desirous of comprehending its nation 
and its history as part of « great connected European 
development. The period from 1517 to 1871 is un- 
intelligible considered purely as German history ; 
the extremely difficult period from 1555 to 1648 is 
best treated, not merely as German, but as Kuropean 
history. At this stage, when seed of this kind does 
not immediately bear fruit, but is not entirely 
lost, it is advisable to emphasize the positive and 
creative importance of the ecclesiastical separa- 
tion; for instance, to explain how the opposition 
between the two different conceptions of Christianity, 
known as Catholicism and Protestantism, provided 
a stimulus to European life which prevented 
stagnation and forced it to advance from step to 
step. 
As regards revision, revision of every preceding 
lesson is in every case highly valuable, and especially 
valuable in the Fourth Form. Historical matter is 
not connected, as are mathematical or grammatical 
details, by any clear law, even when the master is 
able to deliver his explanations with a clarity and 
precision of expression which many of our famous 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 91 
historical investigators and writers have failed to 
acquire. The subject is exposed to the possibility 
of many misunderstandings, confusions, and dis- 
placements. Half-knowledge is common, and its 
effects are even more disastrous than complete 
ignorance ; hence every series of events—for instance, 
the very difficult history preliminary to the Thirty 
Years’ War—must necessarily be gone through 
twice: once by way of narration and description, 
and again by way of revision. We should also 
advise that revision, even of the second kind—the 
general revision of large sections of history—should 
be performed with special reference at this stage to 
actual facts and events. The methods above out- 
lined should be used in somewhat elementary form, 
and the leading motives treated somewhat super- 
ficially. Questions should be of the following form : 
With what foreign enemies had Germany to struggle 
in the ninth, tenth, and other centuries ? What 
nationalities conquered and devastated Italy from 
A.D. 476 to 1527% Which of these nations left 
permanent traces of its occupation upon the 
country ? What part of Germany and what countries 
of Europe adhered to the Augsburg Confession, and 
which remained by the Old Church at the outset of 
the seventeenth century ? What districts of Germany 
became seats of war during the Thirty Years’ War 
and other wars? And so forth. 
In our opinion, there is no material difference 
between historical teaching in the classical schools 
and the corresponding classes of the modern schools.
-P-A-G-E-114
  92 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
In the Prussian syllabus of 1892 an extra hour 
(2+2) is granted to “history and geography,” 
which hour is very properly assigned to geography. 
The history teaching at these institutions seems to 
us of special importance for the reason that the 
influences which can foster the historical sense are 
provided in but very moderate amount by the other 
subjects of instruction in the modern school. The 
learning of English at this stage widens the intel- 
lectual horizon, as does the learning of any new 
foreign tongue. It is, however, by the whole 
organization and object of the modern school, 
devoted to purposes primarily and immediately 
practical, and very reasonably, too; but the in- 
direct benefits which in other cases can be expected 
from so many sides as a stimulus to historical per- 
ception are here inconsiderable. Historical teaching 
has, by its very essence, both a realist and an 
idealist side. The men of whom we read were 
beings of like passions with ourselves, experiencing 
our own needs, our own weaknesses, and our own 
ambitions ; but the wide connexion in which we 
meet them gives them a character similar to the 
heroes of Greek mythology. We hope we shall not 
be misunderstood when we say that in the classical 
school the realistic side should be emphasized, while 
in the modern school the ideal side should be brought 
out. In other words, had we more time at our 
disposal for teaching history in the modern school 
where Latin is not learnt, we should, in treating of 
the Crusades, dwell less upon the commercial results,
-P-A-G-E-115
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 93 
and more upon the religious impulse due to these 
enterprises, and handle the point with less detail 
in the classical school. 
LOWER FIFtTuH. 
Here we reach the last year of the central stage, 
which we have assumed for our purpose. The new 
organization in Prussia, which has been in force 
since the time of the so-called scholastic reform, 
has given this Form a somewhat special character. 
The Form is preparing for the junior leaving certifi- 
cate, for it was not to be expected that any educa- 
tional reform in Germany or Prussia would miss 
the opportunity of instituting a new examination. 
The examination has now been abolished, but the 
hypothesis on which it rested remains. It was 
assumed that this Form would have closed the first 
stage in the education of a scholar, and the assump- 
tion as such was justified. The pupils thus will 
realize more clearly the fact that they have reached 
the turning-point, for the reason that a certain 
number of their comrades now leave school for 
practical or industrial life, though by no means so 
many as seem to have been expected when the 
examination was introduced. There was at least 
one good point in the certificate examination—it 
gave an ocular proof to the members of this Form 
of the serious nature of their position. It is true 
that, after the introduction of the examination, 
every possible effort was made to lower this impor-
-P-A-G-E-116
  94 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
tance. It was not to be taken very seriously, and 
was nothing more than an ordinary school examina- 
tion of somewhat more formal nature. The scholars 
at this stage, however, regarded it as a serious 
business, more seriously, perhaps, than the senior 
leaving certificate will be considered. At this point 
we propose to make a small divergence into the 
region of school politics, which have no immediate 
connexion with our subject. There is a band of 
zealous humanists, with whom we agree in all 
essential points, which offers a strong opposition to 
the grant of any concessions to Lower-Fifth boys 
who leave their school. In the Berlin Conference of 
1873 Bonitz designated them as deserters from the 
flag. This body accordingly desires to make the well- 
known privilege of one year’s military service con- 
ditional upon passing the school-leaving certificate, 
or at any rate upon concluding the full secondary 
course. We regard this last rigorous measure as 
neither useful nor feasible. P. Cauer, the learned 
and zealous champion of this view, says that the 
classical school is a school for the few, and not for 
the many. We, however, consider it much more 
to the interest of the nation that the leading classes 
in trade and manufacture, in military and technical 
pursuits, in town councils and Parliament, should 
contain a strong infusion of men who have gone 
through a secondary course of education, even if 
they have only reached the Upper Fifth. Hence, in 
our view, the secondary school is a school, not for 
the few, but for as many as possible. Therefore
-P-A-G-E-117
INTERMEDIATE STAGE | 95 
we consider that the syllabus should not be cut 
short at the Lower Fifth, as was done in the Prussian 
scheme of 1892; it should be drawn up as if every 
pupil in a secondary school were to make the leaving 
certificate his final object. We do not see why 
those who leave from the Lower Fifth, often much 
against their will and under force of circumstances, 
should be called deserters from the flag, or should 
be considered a quantité négligeable as regards the 
famous right of a certificate. The regulation in 
any case would be of little use, as the instruction 
in the Lower Fifth, and the teachers who give it, 
would naturally be strongly influenced by considera- 
tion for those who were shortly to appear as can- 
didates for certificates. There will always be some 
who wish or are obliged to leave from the Lower 
Fifth, and their special case has been considered 
without injuring the vital principles of secondary 
instruction in the historical period set down for 
study by this Form. At this point we must make 
a virtue of necessity, and extract what benefit 
may be gained from the new regulation. Though 
the Form is regarded as a concluding stage, it must 
be so handled as to advance the progress of those 
who intend to enter the higher stages. In fact, 
the character of the Form work is “ conclusive,”’ is 
intended to produce positive benefit, and .such 
benefit will be apparent somewhere in our special 
subject. Of Greek and Latin we need speak no 
further ; they remain the chief source of influence for 
developing the historical sense, much as their efficacy 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
    96 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
has been impaired under the new era in Prussia. 
Now that linguistic difficulties are less predominant, 
the Anabasis of Xenophon can be better appreciated, 
and the Homeric world is now first opened to the 
form. Even for those who leave at the end of the 
school year this work is by no means entirely lost. 
In Latin Cicero’s speeches are read, some Sallust or 
Livy, and some poetry. Virgil—in Prussia at least 
—is almost too difficult, but Ovid’s Fasti can be 
read at this stage, and provides numerous pictures 
of Roman holiday customs and working life in easy 
and suitable selections. As regards French, the 
advantages of this language are better appreciated 
—its clarity of expression and the relative perfec- 
tion of its prose. If it should happen that a good 
modern play is read, the delicacy of French dialogue 
becomes more obvious. Thus the pupils learn to 
appreciate the high qualities of a foreign neighbour- 
ing nation immediately through their language, which 
was impossible in the Fourth Form, and the results 
are also of importance as contributing to the historical 
sense of justice and truth. It will be objected that 
these matters have but a very indirect connexion 
with historical teaching. This objection we admit. 
Even more indirect at this stage is, possibly, the study 
of German literature, though it is highly important 
as contributing to that side of culture which we 
understand under the term “historical sense.” 
German literature lessons, where they are concerned 
with reading, undergo an essential change of char- 
acter at this stage. In the last four months of the
-P-A-G-E-119
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 97 
Upper-Fourth-Form instruction more important 
dramatic works are usually read, to which prac- 
tice no objection can possibly be raised. As we 
have said, we should like to add such patriotic 
pieces as Uhland’s Herzog Ernst, Kleist’s Prinz 
von Homburg, Goethe’s Gotz von Berlichingen ; 
but we should not follow the proposals of the 
Prussian syllabus of 1892 in adding Schiller’s Tell, 
which is much more suitable for a Fifth Form. The 
Fourth Form is more concerned with the matter of 
poetry than with the art or spirit of it, and has no 
appreciation of its beauty as such. This is no mis- 
fortune in itself, and must be accepted. The change 
begins, as it should, in the Lower Fifth. Here pupils 
read various dramatic works of first-rate merit— 
Tell, the Jungfrau von Orleans, Hermann und 
Dorothea. They are now introduced to poetry as 
a work of art, and rise above the mere consideration 
of the ‘subject-matter. Any German that is read 
in this Form should be read from the esthetic point 
of view.* We assert as a definite principle in this 
Form that the study of German literature should 
have no direct connexion with the historical in- 
struction. Schiller’s Ze// derives no interest or 
effect from the fact that at one time in the year 
A.D. 1808 some events of the kind actually happened 
* By this we do not mean to agree with the statement 
of the Prussian syllabus of 1892, which says on p. 15: “ The 
commentary is to be as simple as possible, and to be governed 
by the purpose of enabling the pupil to comprehend the whole 
as a self-contained work of art.” This was not repeated in 1901. 
‘
-P-A-G-E-120
  98 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
in Switzerland. The poet here makes free use of 
historical fact for his own purpose, and his pro- 
cedure is justified by the beauty which he has 
created. It is unhistorical, but is eternally true, 
and does not profess to be what actually happened, 
or was supposed to have happened, at any definite 
time in the fourteenth or fifteenth or any other 
century. Naturally, any extension of outlook or 
clarity of ideas which the pupil may gain from good, 
or even from moderately good, German literature 
lessons is so much advantage to the historical 
teacher. The advantage, however, in this case is 
derived by a negative process, by the comparison 
of poetical with historical truth, by the distinction 
between what happened at a definite time and place 
through the action of definite people, and is thus 
true or actual, and that which never happened at 
any time anywhere, but is none the less true of all 
times and places ; this is a distinction that becomes 
clearer to the pupil’s consciousness at this stage. 
At the same time the distinction is connected with 
a further point which the teacher must carefully 
consider. We have said earlier that true historical 
teaching can only begin when some idea, however 
vague, has been secured of the difference between 
what actually happened and what is only said by 
poetry or legend to have happened. At this age 
and stage of school life the psychological process 
is completed ; historical criticism comes into being, 
and should be trained by the master at intervals 
and tactfully, but certainly not avoided entirely.
-P-A-G-E-121
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 99 
A Third-Form boy is sorry to hear that Tell had no 
actual existence ; a Fifth-Form boy feels differently, 
because for him this heroic figure lives in a much 
higher sense. Hence we assume that when occasion 
arises, the history master may turn to this point. 
He should not touch upon it too frequently, or 
with ulterior object, and certainly not in order to 
display his own learning ; but it is worth while to 
take some traditional or widespread falsehood, some 
one of the ineradicable stories of historical assassina- 
tions and legendary cruelties, and refute it critically 
by the use of evidence. This process strengthens 
the sense of historical truth, and the mind thus 
trained is not likely to be attracted, for instance, by 
the foolish and malignant gossip concerning the 
suicide of Luther, or the many poisonings attributed 
to the Jesuits. 
To historical study as such—that is, to history 
and geography—three lessons a week (2+1) are 
assigned in Prussia and elsewhere. As regards the 
particular geography to be studied, there can be 
no doubt, in view of the fact that this Form is the 
concluding stage for some pupils, and is a relative 
conclusion for others. This subject is the political 
geography of the European states, with constant 
reference to the corresponding conditions in the 
German Empire. The task of comparison is easy 
and highly instructive, as, in accordance with our 
presuppositions, the geography of Germany has 
formed the main theme of geographical instruction 
during the two years in the Fourth Form. These 
7—2 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
    100 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
two geographical points are in congruity with the 
historical period assigned to the Lower Fifth by the 
Prussian syllabus, which requires the last hundred 
and fifty years of German-Prussian history. This — 
is a period which can only be treated as German- 
Kuropean, whatever people may say.* We must 
not, however, be led astray in this matter by the 
Prussian syllabus of 1901—‘“‘ Revision and comple- 
tion of the geography of Europe, with the excep- 
tion of the German Empire.”” Were this instruction 
in our hands, we should take the liberty of con- 
sidering the above-mentioned comparison as the 
desired and necessary completion. Two lessons a 
week are given in the modern schools for the same 
sensible object. For the moment we assume this 
syllabus as fixed; it is already obvious that the 
equipment of the classical school pupil who enters 
practical life after six years at school includes but one 
year of ancient history, and on this we shall have to 
speak when we proceed to discuss the Upper Fifth. 
* “The history of other countries,” say the Prussian syllabuses 
of 1892 and 1901, “is only to be introduced so far as is necessary 
for the understanding of German and Brandenburg-Prussian 
history.” This, however, implies a good deal of European 
history before the period from 1740 to 1871; we cannot understand 
how, for instance, the Napoleonic epoch from 1804 to 1815 can 
be treated except as European history. Nobody as yet has 
proposed to introduce into this period the domestic history of 
England or Russia or Sweden. We do not, however, wish that 
our historical instructions and conceptions should sink to the 
level of English historical writing as represented by A History 
of our Own Times (McCarthy), which means nothing more than a 
history of England of our own times. 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 101 
Here we must say a word on geographical instruc- 
tion. Our remarks may not be very idealistic, and 
will possibly be in contradiction to the views of 
many respected geographical meetings, though it is 
known that geographers, like all specialists, are 
inclined to consider that the business of school- 
boys is to study their special subject throughout 
every hour that can be secured for the purpose. 
We should certainly be wrong in acceding to the 
views of Bonitz at the Berlin Conference of 1873, 
who wished to deprive geography of its character as 
a science, and said that it was but a mosaic of more 
or less useful scraps of knowledge collected from 
many other departments. It is possible to give a 
description of the present conditions of our planet 
in strictly scientific form, and so far geography is a 
science ; but for school purposes—and we refer to 
classical as well as modern or commercial schools— 
we are obliged to emphasize the utilitarian character 
of geography as a school subject, especially in the 
Lower Fifth. Geography, in our opinion at this stage, 
has to be directed to the very excellent and im- 
portant object of providing pupils, whether they 
aim at practical life or further study, with useful 
knowledge concerning the position, the products, 
the resources, the wealth, the civilization, etc., of 
the European States, with continual reference to 
the conditions which obtain in Germany. For two 
years Germany has been the object of historical 
teaching ; for a third year, in the Lower Fifth, geo- 
graphy must be concerned with the political de-
-P-A-G-E-124
  102 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
scription of the European world, in the centre of 
which our country stands, the object being that 
the pupil may compare in every case the conditions 
prevalent in his own country with those of other 
countries. He will learn that the French army 
contains so many hundred thousand men, and the 
German army so many hundred thousand; that 
England or Germany owns so many cattle, sheep, 
horses, and donkeys; he will learn the per- 
centage of illiterates in Spain as compared with 
Germany, etc. 
Thus, our opinion is that, at this point, even in 
the classical school, a strongly practical element 
should be introduced. Classical schools are by no 
means so idealistic as they are represented, and 
even in the department of history we should like 
to see a strong and practical realism side by side 
with idealism. Utilitarianism and science are by 
no means mutually opposed.* Learning must, 
indeed, be pursued for the sake of learning, and 
Latin, Greek, or mathematics, from this point of 
view, are no trivial matters ; but all theoretical and 
practical educationists of any soundness will admit 
* W. Miinch, in his latest work, Zukunftspddagogik (Berlin, 
1904), p. 216, says: “ The contrast between utilitarianism and 
idealism as factors in education must not be considered so sharply 
as has hitherto been customary. The one standpoint does not 
exclude the other, and in any case the subject matter of education 
can be given one or the other character, as desirable.” This is 
and always has been our opinion, and we are therefore not affected 
by the reproach made by Miinch on p. 208, when he refers to 
“the older representatives of our higher educational system.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
INTERMEDIATE STAGE 103 
that boys of fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen years 
at this stage, can be emphatically reminded that they 
are learning for the work of life, and not for life in 
general, but for the life of their own people and 
state; that as they are to be hereafter active 
citizens of the German Empire, they must learn its 
history and geography, and become intimate both 
with these and with the history and geography of 
the rest of Europe. Hence, geography in the Lower 
Fifth is the proper place for that practical instruction 
in political economy which belongs properly to the 
middle school. At this point should be stated those 
economic facts which have characterized European 
life, not merely to-day or yesterday, but within the 
last hundred years or earlier. 
It is in this sense that we agree with the new 
regulation for Prussian and other classical schools, 
which lays down the historical period for the Lower 
Fifth as consisting of German and European history 
from 1740 to 1871, with a short chronicle of events 
until 1888. It is in view of these considerations 
that we resign ourselves to the loss of the two years’ 
course in ancient history, although this course was 
a very effective and beneficial influence, for the 
reason that the interaction of thorough historical 
study and thorough linguistic study provided active 
opposition to superficiality and to breadth without 
depth. Much, however, as we may despise the so- 
called spirit of the age, we must none the less accomo- 
date ourselves to certain necessities of the age, and 
if we make a concession for intelligible reasons,
-P-A-G-E-126
  104 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
we must make it absolutely and without reserva- 
tion. 
When we consider the special historical instruc- 
tion for the Lower Fifth according to the Prussian 
organization now in force we meet with a remarkable 
difficulty of an unexampled nature—the fact that 
we have too much time at our disposal. For the 
treatment of the history of one hundred and thirty 
years in 2x 40=80 lessons our masters are neither 
prepared nor have we available text-books, though, 
as may easily be imagined, some of these latter 
have been put on the market in a hurry.* 
The new regulations quietly presuppose that 
every teacher throughout the secondary schools of 
our country can in one night acquire the capacity 
assumed by the official syllabus, including a know- 
ledge of “the comparative development of our 
social and economic system.’ In my opinion, how- 
ever, it will be as difficult for most teachers as it 
has been for me to gain a clear idea of complex con- 
nexions and of the depths of national character for 
the purpose of Form teaching. Other history masters 
will doubtless have experienced, or will discover, 
that the more detailed the narrative which is given 
to a Form (and in this case detail is inevitable) the 
more difficult is its treatment. I have no doubt 
that a conscientious teacher will be able to over- 
come these difficulties, and that they will be con- 
* Not to be confused with the better and more carefully 
arranged text-books—such, for instance, as that for Lower-Fifth 
instruction, by Moldenhauer, Berlin, 1894, second edition. 
  
—————
-P-A-G-E-127
    INTERMEDIATE STAGE 105 
quered in many instances by the sole means at the 
master’s disposal—his own powers and industry. 
In any case, the subject will be brought to the 
attention of head-masters’ conferences. Much con- 
sideration will be devoted to the theory, and some 
thirty, sixty, or a hundred papers written upon it ; 
but until these have had their effect we who have 
grown old in this business may be allowed to put 
forth some simple rules for younger colleagues. 
1. The distribution of the period between 1740- 
1871 must be made from the general standpoint of 
European history, not from that of German or 
Prussian history assuch. The main periods will thus 
be 1740-1789, 1789-1815, 1815-1871. The distribu- 
tion must be one that can be always resumed in 
lectures to the Upper Sixth. 
2. An introduction is advisable, giving a clear 
survey of Brandenburg-Prussian history, as a part 
of general German history. This need be no more 
detailed in Prussian schools than in those of Saxony 
or Wurtemberg, and the same is true vice versa. 
As it is part of German history, it should be no 
shorter in the schools of Saxony or Wurtemberg than 
in those of Prussia.* 
3. Events, characters, and descriptions should be 
handled as far as possible consecutively, upon the 
Homeric principle ; but a lesson or two should be 
devoted before beginning the period 1789-1815 
* This statement now seems comparatively obvious, yet at 
the Berlin Conference of 1873 under Falk it was received as a 
new and acceptable idea.
-P-A-G-E-128
  106 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
to the condition of the Holy Roman Empire 
(Biedermann, Deutschland im vorigen Jahrhundert, 
vol. i.). 
4. There should be no strategical descriptions 
of battles, but, when possible, the characteristic 
features of any important battle should be men- 
tioned. Such features will be found, for instance, 
in the descriptions of the Seven Years’ War in 
Carlyle’s Frederick the Great—a very useful book 
for the teacher’s preparation, and a book that 
can be recommended to the classical school teacher 
of history, together with the classical work of 
Reinhold Koser (1903). 
5. Special care should be taken in treating of 
economic and social influences lest the teacher be 
found to waste his time. Most of these develop- 
ments, and also the services of individual Prussian, 
and other rulers, are, and always have been, an 
integral part of historical instruction. The work 
of the Elector Frederick William after the Thirty 
Years’ War, of Frederick the Great after the Seven 
Years’ War, of Frederick William ITI. by the reforms 
of Stein-Hardenberg, and after the war of 1813- 
1815, in organizing and introducing the Customs 
Union in their own country and in Germany, has 
never undergone revision. It is to be supposed 
that pupils have learnt by degrees, in their passage 
from the Fifth Form to the Lower Fifth, what is 
meant by the terms “‘ money,” “taxes,” “‘ burden of 
taxation,” ‘‘domestic economy,” ‘ competition,” 
“duties,” “‘protective duties,’ etc.; what a Cus- 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
    INTERMEDIATE STAGE 107 
toms Union is, and many other things of the kind. 
As regards, however, the existing conditions of the 
constitution and its administration, the essential 
points, together with the so-called science of civics, 
belong to the geographical lesson. 
6. Treatment in this case should be unequal in 
point of detail. Some points should be fully de- 
tailed, others expounded only in outline by means 
of a clearly arranged conspectus. Thus, the events 
of 1813, and even the military movements of that 
year, are to be fully narrated, because they com- 
bine every element which can make historical narra- 
tive impressive, and are thus easily remembered. 
On the other hand, a detailed narrative of the war 
between 1792 and 1801 would be waste of time. 
7. Special difficulties are offered by the history of 
the period from 1815 to any point earlier than the 
present date. The statement is especially true of 
the section from 1848 to 1852, though the preceding 
sections—1815—-1830 and 1830—-1848—are compara- 
tively simple, and can be shortly explained. None 
the less, those four years contain the crisis of the 
century, and, as we have time at our disposal, they 
should be treated in full detail, the more so as in the 
Sixth Form, where the time is very short, it will be 
necessary to rely partly upon such impressions and 
recollections as may remain of the detailed teaching 
in the Lower Fifth. On the other hand, the period 
from 1852-1863 can be treated with brevity. Only 
the essential points need be emphasized—the Crimean 
War, the Austro-French War, and the fruitless
-P-A-G-E-130
  108 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
attempt to secure German unity. Explanation 
should be given of the extreme danger to which the 
nation was exposed, and its almost desperate condi- 
tion, whether real or apparent, in 1863. Adequate 
time must be left for 1863-1871; 1866 should be 
carefully treated, the central idea being that it was 
better for our nation to learn the nonentity of the 
old German Federal Constitution by means of a war 
of the new Germany against the old, by a victory 
of Prussia over Austria and Federal Germany, than 
by the victory of a foreign nation—France—over 
our own. ‘These are events but forty years old, yet 
they have lost their bitterness for Germany through 
the war of 1870, and for Austria through the Alliance 
of October 15, 1879, and through the fact that the 
intellectual ties between the Germans of the Empire 
and Austria have become far closer than previous 
to 1866. 
The narrative proper, or historical lecture, is to 
end with 1871 and the revival of German nationalism. 
Times change. In my youth the door was closed 
with 1815, and the master was not supposed to 
touch upon events subsequent to that boundary- 
line ; now a good idea is pushed to exaggeration, 
and we are to continue until 1888 or to the present 
time. The present time means the very moment 
at which we are speaking, and in the year 1895 the 
master would have been obliged to touch upon the 
war between China and Japan, in the year 1900 
upon the Transvaal War, and in 1904 upon the 
Russo-Japanese War, etc. It is impossible, how-
-P-A-G-E-131
  
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 109 
ever, to teach everything at school, and facts should 
not be taught as “history” which are not really 
history for the teacher, standing as he does amid 
the confusion of contradictions, and are, therefore, 
rather unsuitable matter of instruction for the 
pupils. A mere chronicle narrative of one hour 
will suffice.* 
As regards the teacher’s lecture and its style, we 
propose to say but little at this stage. The en- 
thusiasm inspired by the subject-matter can no 
more be taught than personality or character. The 
lecture can only be “ fine,” if it is true, and it is 
only true when it is the expression of a strong and 
manly character inspired by faithful devotion to the 
nation. On this subject, however, we have much 
reason for cherishing good hopes. At the present 
time we are involved in a great public life; a 
merely private existence is no longer possible to 
anyone, and certainly not to the history master at 
a classical or modern school. Hence something 
of that ¢£ ud:dv tov Tpaypdator é&s which Polybius 
demands will communicate itself by degrees to our 
historica! teaching, both at other stages and at this, 
where in a certain sense itis most necessary. During 
* Schiller’s Handbuch des wpraktischen Pddagogik, second 
edition, p. 562, says: “ It is obvious merely from the events of 
1888 that modern history cannot be concluded with the year 
1871”; this is a somewhat precipitate mode of deciding the 
question. However important the events of 1888 may be they 
cannot decide the question whether it is possible or advisable 
to make the history of the last thirty years from 1871 a subject 
of regular school instruction.
-P-A-G-E-132
  110 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
the period over which I can look back a great change 
has already taken place in this respect. The purely 
professorial tone has largely died out, and a symptom 
of the change is the fact that many more teachers 
are able to lecture “ extempore ”’ than in the time 
of my youth. The word “ extempore ”’ must be taken 
cum grano salis. The first requirement is truth. 
Moreover, at the stage which we have reached, the 
lecture or commentary must be marked by a greater 
degree of consecutiveness, and no objection can, 
therefore, be raised if the schoolmaster follows the 
example of great orators and professors by writing 
notes of what he proposes to say, and using his 
notes as he speaks. The notes may extend to a 
notebook if he wishes. 
Revision will obviously proceed as before. The 
matter given to the Form in any one lesson will be 
repeated at the outset of the following lesson, and 
when a section of the period has been worked through 
the whole will be revised. Another method which has 
been occasionally used, and has been as zealously 
recommended as it has been vigorously rejected, is 
extempore revision. A revival of this method seems 
probable under the stimulus of the new Prussian 
syllabus, with its remarks upon “ essays in brief.” 
Against the use of this method there will be little 
objection to urge if there be any guarantee what- 
ever that its very considerable difficulties will be 
invariably handled with indulgence and discretion, 
ratione modoque. But in the first place we have 
not the time at our disposal or the constant practice
-P-A-G-E-133
INTERMEDIATE STAGE 111 
which alone could make such methods of practical 
benefit ; in the second place, the pupil is afraid of 
the written question, which may refer to any part 
of the whole period on which he is engaged. He 
therefore undertakes those special revisions on his 
own account which have been so emphatically and 
effectually challenged, and with considerable reason, 
in the new leaving certificate regulations for 1892. 
If, however, there is time at any point for the 
practice of these essays in brief, it will certainly be 
found here in the Lower Fifth. Such essays should 
be composed in Form, and a capable teacher will 
see that the pupils thence derive such scanty 
advantage as we can promise from the practice. 
At this stage another problem arises. It is here 
for the first time that the pupil can take notes of 
the teacher’s lecture, such notes having been formerly 
simply dictated. The question is further extended 
by the growing knowledge of shorthand. It affects 
the instruction throughout these upper stages, and 
this subject of revision most particularly. In the 
junior Forms dictation is supported by excellent 
reasons, but in the case of pupils who have reached 
the Lower Fifth I have myself extended or restricted 
the practice in view of the kind of revision I wished 
to secure, which may be either mechanical repeti- 
tion or may disregard chronology. It would be 
inadvisable to dogmatize upon the subject, and 
much may be left to the master’s observation and 
tact. One objection urged is that, when a pupil is 
occupied in writing, his attention is less close, but
-P-A-G-E-134
112 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
no great stress need be laid upon this. The lecture 
may be as interesting, as lively, or as perfect as is 
possible within the compass of any self-satisfied 
master, but boys remain boys. At two o’clock in 
the afternoon, or at eleven o’clock, or wherever the 
latest perversion of pure forenoon instruction has 
been introduced, it will be found during the fifth 
lesson—from twelve to one—that very few pupils 
are able to follow with regular or concentrated 
attention even a twenty-minutes lecture. Such 
note-taking is by no means so mechanical as is 
asserted, and there is no reason for rejecting a 
means of helping the attention when we have a /ene 
tormentum conducted by the pupil himself. 
During this revision from lesson to lesson we shall 
often meet with pupils who are able to reproduce 
fluently and easily the matter of the preceding 
lesson, even in the very words of the master. Great 
stress is now laid upon “ the reproduction of narra- 
tive ” throughout the lower forms, and the Prussian 
syllabus of 1892 concludes its “ observations on 
method,” as regards history, with the words: “* Oral 
teaching of an informal nature must be the method 
specially employed in historical teaching.” In 1901 
we are delighted to see that this statement has been 
replaced by the more modest and correct opinion 
of p. 49: “In historical teaching a pupil must be 
practised as often as possible in the power of re- 
peating what he has learnt in his own words and 
in connected narrative.” In other words, the pupil 
must learn the art of expressing himself when he 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
INTERMEDIATE STAGE 113 
has anything to say. Here the historical lesson is 
especially useful, for the simple reason that it is 
particularly difficult for anyone to express himself — 
intelligibly in relating historically connected events. 
For that special reason the teacher will be forced 
to follow a mixed method. Difficult parts he will 
have repeated by question and answer, and when a 
pupil gives a narrative of the easier parts of a sub- 
ject the master will constantly interrupt him to 
correct an expression, to refuse a meaningless phrase, 
and to quicken the intelligence by a question. The 
informal lecture, as such, can never be an end in 
itself, nor is there any special need for the dis- 
semination of the practice, seeing that the capacity 
for informal lecturing is an appalling feature of 
modern society. It is to learn history, and not to 
learn fluent speech, that narrative or any other 
informally connected account is given by the scholar 
during the revision hour. 
The revision of larger sections, when the historical 
matter is reproduced in new form. from different 
points of view, must not be too detailed, although 
the Prussian syllabus gives, comparatively speaking, 
abundant time to the Lower Fifth for this purpose. 
Revision will be concerned, not with the detail or 
the narrative, but with the fundamental facts, the 
decisive motives. Similarly, the essential thread of 
historical movement will be revised as a connected 
whole by question and answer, with the object of 
impressing what has been already understood upon 
the memory. ‘The section of the text-book under 
8 
     
-P-A-G-E-136
  114 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
treatment will be prepared at home by the pupils if 
they are to gain the full benefit of this revision or to 
take partinit. Such revision is a special purpose of 
the text-book’s existence. I will not conceal from 
my younger colleagues that I consider this process 
of revision the most difficult of the teacher’s tasks. 
His art is here more particularly displayed, and 
very few can congratulate themselves upon entire 
success. It is necessary that the teacher should 
first have a clear view of the guiding historical idea, 
and consequently that he should have arranged the 
matter in accordance with this idea, though he need 
not forthwith produce his arrangement as though 
it was something of special value. We will suppose 
that the section from 1740-1789 has been taught in 
detail, and that the master has convinced himself 
from hour to hour that individual points have been 
properly seized and understood. This period can 
then be revised from the standpoint of the most 
important reign of the epoch—that of Frederick the 
Great—and such revision will deal :— 
1. With his domestic Government, its manner, its 
Court life, those about him, and his personal ad- 
ministration, after which we shall proceed to 
(a) military administration; (6) finance; (c) ad- 
ministration of the country, agriculture, trade, etc. ; 
(d) the judicature; (¢) educational efforts, art, and 
science. 
2. His relations with foreign Powers : (a) Austria ; 
his German policy in this connexion; (0d) Russia ; 
(c) France ; (d) Great Britain ; (e) Sweden, etc.
-P-A-G-E-137
  INTERMEDIATE STAGE 115 
I do not believe that in any one of the points I 
have proposed there need be any material difference 
between the instruction at the classical or the 
modern school. I have, however, had no recent 
experience of the latter schools, and do not, there- 
fore, press my opinion. It has been already 
observed that in the modern school great stress 
must be laid upon historical teaching. Where 
places in Form are determined by the addition 
of the marks in the several subjects, and where the 
marks carried by these subjects differ in amount, 
I would make history equivalent to English; and 
would take the subjects for essays more often from 
the historical period than is done in the classical 
school. In the revision of periods, also, many more 
leading ideas will be followed than are possible in 
the classical school. Of these, however, we cannot 
speak to any purpose, as they depend upon the 
general character of the material, upon its special 
mode of treatment in the modern school, and upon 
the views of the teacher entrusted with the subject. 
One further point may be mentioned in conclu- 
sion : the historical sense and historical knowledge 
can be largely increased by home reading. Such 
reading can be influenced by the teacher to some 
extent, especially if he is in charge, or at any rate 
knows the contents, of the school library. A warn- 
ing, however, must be given that this influence can 
be exaggerated. The school—that is to say, the 
masters of it—must not attempt to rule any wider 
area than their powers can comprehend. To speak 
8—2
-P-A-G-E-138
  116 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
of a “ wisely organized and guided home reading, 
and its blessings under the influence of the school,”’ 
is pure Utopianism, or, to put the matter plainly, 
great exaggeration. ‘The teacher may offer advice 
when his advice is asked, and also when it is not, 
if he thinks advisable; otherwise, entire freedom 
must be given, and historical books must not be 
forced upon a pupil who would prefer to read 
scientific or geographical books. The library must 
contain good literature. Archenholz, Treitschke, 
Hausser, etc., must be at hand, and the master can 
now and then let fall a word of praise and recom- 
mendation in this direction. Such words will be 
remembered by the pupils whose interests have 
been won to the study of history. Anything further 
is unnecessary. * 
At this point we should perhaps say a word of 
the many subordinate stimuli to historical teaching, 
such as historical pictures, representations of dress, 
visits to museums or to libraries and archives. In the 
previously mentioned book by J. Collard, p. 404 f., 
* When in charge of a school library I was struck by the 
preference of the elder Forms for the historical novel. Inquiries 
were constantly made for Ebers, Felix Dahn, Freytag, Willibald 
Alexis, and even Walter Scott. To the latter I had no objection 
to urge, but such books as Dahn’s Kampf wm Rom aroused serious 
misgivings as to whether the historical sense was not greatly 
damaged by such exaggerated descriptions, apart from other losses 
incurred. But history cannot be learnt from novels, though 
foolish amateurism has sometimes urged the contrary, and this 
is a fact which we need not be told, though we must sometimes 
repeat it to our pupils.

the question is exhaustively explained in the 
chapter, “‘ Le moyen age étudié par les monuments 
de Louvain.” Something of the kind may also be 
found in German writings, and people will be 
always ready to advise historical excursions in 
addition to those devoted to geography and natural 
science. ‘This has little or nothing to do with our 
present purpose, dependent as it is entirely upon 
the locality, the time, and the individuality of the 
master. The study of local history, the concentra- 
tion of general history upon Cologne or Dantzig, 
or upon the landscape of the home, may prove 
stimulating, and deserves consideration in any dis- 
cussion of the problems of historical teaching. At 
the same time, a warning must be uttered that too 
much value should not be placed upon these matters, 
as the pupi’s of our secondary schools are not yet 
prepared to use them correctly, but are undergoing 
such preparation.

THE HIGHER STAGES —— ~~ 
Upper Firru, Lower SrxtH, AND UPPER SIXTH. 
Tuus we reach the turning-point which was so 
strongly marked in 1892 by the new Prussian regula- 
tions that an inclination arose to regard the Lower 
Fifth, when they had completed their course as a 
‘point of divergence,” where a decision would be 
definitely taken as to which boys would or could 
profit by the continuation of their studies; it was 
supposed that anyone who went through the lower 
leaving certificate after eighteen months or two 
years in the Lower Fifth would come to a stand- 
still, and apply his energies to some form of practical 
life. The expectation realized in the case of the 
Realgymnasien that some good and nearly all the 
bad pupils would leave from the Lower Fifth, and 
that only a chosen few would remain, has not been 
fulfilled, the less so as the higher leaving certificate 
examination was made considerably easier at that 
time. The general character of the Upper Fifth, 
and consequently of the concluding stages of the 
German secondary school, will remain unaltered. 
118
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE HIGHER STAGES 119 
The intellectual level of these upper stages will be 
somewhat lower than previously, for the reason that 
the whole syllabus up to and including the Lower 
Fifth has been arranged with undue prominence to 
lead up to that Form at which school studies were 
supposed to end ; also because the supposition has 
been unfulfilled that the master would be concerned 
during the three following years with a smaller 
number of relatively more capable pupils. It would 
be advisable for the history teacher to renounce 
any illusions in this direction. 
According to the present organization in most 
German secondary schools, the Upper Fifth begin 
the second progress through the wide field of 
history—a process which ought to produce the 
same effects as a second reading of a Bill in Parlia- 
ment. <A third reading, decisive in its effects, and 
concluding historical education at school, does not 
exist. Attempts of the kind, general revisions, and 
the like, are failures simply for want of time. A 
number of those who leave school for the University, 
apart from those who make a speciality of history, 
will perhaps attend some historical lectures. A not 
inconsiderable number will attempt to complete 
their historical training by reading historical works, 
as may be concluded from the fact that important 
works of a general historical character enjoy a con- 
siderable sale. Some progress in this respect seems 
to be marked by such a fact, for instance, as the 
sale of that admirable historical work, Schlosser’s 
Universalhistorische Ubersicht der Geschichte der alten
-P-A-G-E-142
120 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Welt und thre Kultur (1826), which has never reached 
a second edition, while at the present time such 
excellent works as the Greek history of Max Duncker, 
which is also in nine volumes, and does not exhaust 
the subject, or Friedlinder’s descriptions of Roman 
social life, have gone through five editions between 
1862 and 1881, though they are no less seriously scien- 
tific than the work of Schlosser. Similar examples 
may be produced in considerable number. Hence the 
much-abused secondary schoolmaster who teaches 
history may console himself with the consideration 
that modern wisdom has not so entirely renounced 
antiquity and the past in favour of the present as 
many assert. 
We have first to consider what contribution other 
subjects of instruction make towards historical train- 
ing, and then to consider how these influences can be 
stimulated and organized in historical instruction 
proper. 
Upper FIFrtuH. 
Religious instruction is highly important, and 
acquires, indeed, new importance, throughout these 
higher stages, and therefore in the Upper Fifth. This 
influence is twofold: it strengthens, deepens, and 
clarifies the moral and religious theories of mankind, 
and his destiny, which alone, as we have seen, enable 
us with any profit to regard human affairs from a 
historical standpoint. It also brings to the pupil’s 
notice a most valuable collection of original historical 
records, even when regarded from the historical 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
THE HIGHER STAGES 121 
standpoint alone. These two influences are exerted 
in a manner corresponding with the greater develop- 
ment of the pupils, in a manner that is entirely 
scientific. With this subject of instruction the his- 
terical teacher should feel himself in sympathy, an 
attitude which is rare, even though it is by no means 
difficult—at any rate, in Evangelical institutions. 
In the historical seminaries of our Universities 
nothing of the kind is to be expected. The time 
seems past when the great historical teacher, Nie- 
buhr, could honestly refer to the providence of God 
when lecturing upon the sources of Roman history.* 
Next to the study of divinity, that of German 
literature exerts a strong influence upon historical 
knowledge in its wider sense. Philip Wackernagel, 
in the fourth part of his German reading-book, 
asserts the necessity of providing an introduction 
to the German national literature—a task incum- 
bent upon the teaching given from the First Form 
to the Sixth, and very simple when thus formulated, 
though in reality a very complex and comprehensive 
. task. Historical influences thus become operative, 
and it is clear that their strength may be great when 
the traditional practice is followed, which is also 
observed in the new Prussian and Saxon schemes, 
of reading some Middle High German in the Upper 
Fifth, and thus going deep into the past of our 
nationality. The existing Prussian syllabus does not 
lay down any special course of German literature 
for the upper Forms. It is obvious that the Upper

-P-A-G-E-144
  122 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Fifth is the right place for Middle High German. 
Its introduction here is justified by the fact that no 
history or literature in the true sense is studied in the 
upper stages, but that a historical order is generally 
observed throughout the literary studies. This his- 
torical influence also belongs to language, when 
the pupil learns to know the Nibelungen, Kudrun, 
Walter, etc., from the language they spoke, not from 
translations. The fact is so entirely obvious that 
it has been invariably recognized except in one 
official scheme (1882-1892), which, as everybody 
knows, was ruined by the co-operation of “‘ too many 
cooks.”” The Prussian syllabus of 1892, while per- 
mitting the study of Homer in the original text, 
prohibited the reading of the Nibelungen in the 
primitive German, or the use of this German as the 
foundation of instruction. Here we have an incon- 
sistency that is practically repeated in the new 
syllabus. At the present time German is made 
“the central point of school instruction ;” at the 
present time, also, the forces of the science of 
phonetics are being called in to secure the utmost 
perfection in the study of French; yet, strangely 
enough, our German youth, consisting chiefly of the 
sons of the upper classes, who will claim to take 
their place in those classes in the future, are allowed 
to secure only the most superficial acquaintance with 
their own language in its earlier stages: “‘ Introduc- 
tion to the Nibelungenlied, with extracts from the 
original text, which are to be read and explained 
by the master.”’ For our historical point of view
-P-A-G-E-145
  
THE HIGHER STAGES 123 
it becomes obvious that the pupils of our schools 
and of other institutions of equal value, though dis- 
similar organization, do not merely listen to the 
master’s explanation, but read the text for them- 
selves, and secure some close acquaintance with it. 
We hold no brief on behalf of Middle High German 
or Old High German; we are unable to countenance 
the terminology which speaks of the second classical 
period in our national literature—a phrase, we 
believe, originating with Vilmar. But some per- 
sonal acquaintance with the old and simple German 
language we do unconditionally require for all our 
higher schools—for the modern high school, where 
no Latin is learnt, as well as for the classical school. 
Such study is indispensable as introductory to the 
first-hand records of the historical life of our people. 
More than this we do not ask. . Breadth of view and 
deeper understanding of human life, whether con- 
temporary or historical, may be gained by the con- 
tinuation or resumption of Schiller’s and Goethe’s 
Gedankenlyrik. Thus, here also there is no immediate 
connexion between the two subjects—German litera- 
ture and German history. In essay-writing, how- 
ever, the pupil may well find occasion to use the 
material he has gathered from his history lessons. 
French comes but little into connexion with the 
historical instruction, though historical French prose 
is often read to excellent purpose in the Upper Sixth 
—for instance, the Egyptian campaign of Bonaparte 
in the narrative of Thiers, which has many times 
been edited for school purposes. Here we have a
-P-A-G-E-146
ee eee, ee ee ae 
124 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
simple means of introducing the pupil to the strange 
world of modern Orientalism, and to European 
politics as a whole. Of these subjects he would 
otherwise know nothing, and yet they are most 
admirably calculated to extend his line of vision. 
Apart from such cases as this, French in secondary 
schools is valuable chiefly for itself. In the classical 
schools it is especially valuable as providing the 
pupil with a means for reading French works dealing 
with the special subject which he may choose to 
pursue at the University or in after-life. The study 
of English, which begins in this Form, though in a 
classical school a choice is allowed, subserves the 
same practical purpose, though it must not be for- 
gotten that the learning of every new language opens 
a new horizon ; and the fact is also true of Hebrew, 
which some few pupils begin at this stage. 
As regards Latin and Greek, the reading of his- 
torical records proceeds for the immediate purpose 
of linguistic practice, and the Prussian syllabus of 
1882 went so far as to appoint for reading “ Livy 
and Sallust, with special reference to their history.” 
We do not quite understand what ideas underlie 
this regulation, which has often been repeated in 
similar terms, or whether similar ideas inspired the 
paragraph of the syllabus of 1901, p. 31: “ A point 
of view hitherto constantly neglected, and yet im- 
portant for the interaction of related studies, is 
the possibility of narrowing the connexion between 
the reading of Latin prose authors and the histori- 
cal teaching of a Form.’ for our own part, we  
-P-A-G-E-147
THE HIGHER STAGES 125 
desire no special consideration for historical teach- 
ing. It may, indeed, be said that the reading of the 
first book of Livy, with its popular traditions related 
in sympathetic and poetic language, would enable 
the history teacher to dismiss the Roman Kings very 
shortly, though this is a mode of procedure necessary 
in any case. [t would, however, be entirely erroneous 
to treat such a subject as the second Punic War more 
summarily in the history lesson merely because the 
pupil had read some part of it in his Livy. When 
we say that to read the classical historians is to read 
historical sources, we imply that such close study of 
the text as is necessary for translation brings the 
reader back to the past as represented by these 
authors, and this is a possibility of very rare occur- 
rence in historical teaching proper, owing simply to 
want of time, nor can it ever be so intensive. It is 
also highly important that when the pupil reads 
Cesar, Xenophon, Thiers, Macaulay, Livy, and 
Sallust, he should by degrees secure, and be able 
to reproduce, some conception of the different kinds 
of history. The matter that is read is, however, of 
greater importance. All reading of Greek and Latin 
literature in the Upper Fifth stimulates historical 
study for the simple reason that it brings us into a 
definitely historical environment and atmosphere. 
The fact is especially true of Cicero’s speeches, which- 
ever of them may be assumed as generally read in 
this Form. They introduce the reader to critical 
points in the life of a great statesman, as in the 
speeches against Catiline. Such a speech as the Pro
-P-A-G-E-148
  126 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Roscio Amerino displays the conditions of Italian 
agriculture and of Italian country towns in the first 
century B.c., and thus enables us to understand, and, 
what is still better for the youthful historian, to 
realize how individual happiness or misfortune may 
be affected by great historical events and changes. 
The fact is naturally no less true of the Greek 
authors—the Hellenica or the Memorabilia or the 
selected speeches of Lysias. Everywhere there is 
a historical background, and we might almost say 
that the speech is more valuable to us in proportion 
as the importance of the person concerned diminishes, 
whether it be Sextus Roscius, or Agoratus, or the 
Invalid of the twenty-fourth oration of Lysias. As 
a stimulus to the true historical sense it is most 
desirable that the pupil should understand that 
history is not merely the history of the upper ten 
thousand, but the history of the hundred thousand 
or the million—in short, of the whole nation. We 
have attempted elsewhere* to reconstruct the 
history of a slave in Asia Minor at the time of the 
Peloponnesian War on the basis of a phrase in the 
ninth book of Xenophon’s Anabasis. We would 
undertake to sketch a series of such portraits of the 
lower classes, drawn from classical literature from 
the time of Homer to Horace or the younger Pliny, 
Every teacher who approaches the subject from this 
point of view can discover an infinite number of 
similar examples which provide a very simple and 
yet a very effective means of making the study 
* Pro domo, p. 136 ff.
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE HIGHER STAGES | 127 
interesting, or, to use the proper term, beneficial— 
beneficial, that is, in the sense of the truly historical 
phrase, Nihil humani a me alienum puto. Itis possible 
in the Third and Fourth Forms, and much more so in 
the Upper Fifth and Sixth, at which point we shall 
have to recur to the subject when we mention Horace. 
Finally, as regards geography, it will be assigned, 
like mathematics, to the upper branches of physics, 
the remaining parts of the subject being known as 
applied geography, and thus directly entering the 
scheme of historical instruction. This is not the 
idea of the Prussian syllabus or of the Utopian 
arrangement, which requires for the upper stages at 
least six revisions of geography in every half-year, 
and also history “to the present time,” for the 
Sixth Form, “other geographical revision to be 
undertaken as may be required.”’ We shall not 
interpret these phrases as implying formal geo- 
graphical revision. Whenever history is taught, 
the master should state accurately the locality of 
the events discussed, and thus secure that these 
localities, rivers, mountains, and towns are not mere 
collocations of letters, as they were in the days of 
my youth, and as they probably still are in many 
cases. Natural as this connexion between geography 
and history is, every one of experience knows that 
it has been little practised, and has, therefore, pro- 
duced little result ; yet it is a method which, when 
conjoined with accurate dating—another constantly 
neglected factor—can alone give that precision and 
certainty which historical lectures require.
-P-A-G-E-150
  128 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
The history instruction proper in the upper stage 
—the second perusal of the great book of history— 
falls within a three-years course of three lessons a 
week. The first year in the Upper Fifth is naturally 
given to ancient history, Greek and Roman history 
to the fall of the West Roman Empire. 
We have seen that ancient history for two lessons 
a week was previously assigned to two Forms— 
Greek to the Lower Fifth, and Roman to the Upper 
Fifth—an arrangement which made it possible to 
find some time for the early history of the East. 
This two-years course of ancient history was highly 
beneficial at this particular stage, as arranged by 
the old Prussian syllabus, and, as we have men- 
tioned, we can well understand the regret which 
many feel, and which we share, for that syllabus. 
The study of ancient history and of classical litera- 
ture proved beneficial to either branch. There was 
a comparatively full and accurate knowledge of 
history within definite limits, while historical ideas 
applicable to any other period were gained. More- 
over, a competent teacher could make the most 
admirable use of this subject-matter in the Sixth 
Form by discussions upon essays, treatment from 
special standpoints, etc. As things are, however, 
we cannot help ourselves, and complaint is useless.* 
We must, therefore, remodel our organization. 
* We can understand the indignation of those monomaniacs 
among us who wish to restore the classical school in its old 
purity, including Latin composition, and are desirous to unite 
for the purpose of recapturing, on behalf of the classical school,
-P-A-G-E-151
  THE HIGHER STAGES 129 
In the first place, we must gain an accurate com- 
prehension of the historical matter for study. Un- 
fortunately, our text-books are by no means adequate 
for this purpose, and it is well known that the pre- 
mature reforms in Prussia have thrown text-books 
into so chaotic a condition that it will be long before 
order is secured—we mean real order, and not pro- 
gramme arrangement. The new text-books have 
been manufactured somewhat too hastily to inspire 
us with confidence, while the older text-books, such 
the positions that have been lost. We doubt the correctness of 
this point of view. History as such would not be greatly bene- 
fited even if the old conditions were restored. It would be 
necessary to secure that the old amount of time should once 
more be given to the study of Latin and Greek. This is the 
weakest point of the new regulations, and it is already obvious 
that the precipitous descent upon which we have entered cannot 
be continued. It may be true that nine years’ study of the 
Latin and Greek languages and antiquities forms the backbone 
of classical school education ; in that case the backbone should 
be strengthened, and it is ridiculous to reduce the time to seven 
hours in the Third and Fourth, and to six hours in the Fifth and 
Sixth. On the other hand, the proposition may be false ; in that 
case some other object of study should be made the backbone 
and should be provided with an adequate number of hours. 
But no other study has as yet been found. This note is repeated 
from our first edition (1895); since that date there has been 
an improvement, and the Third and Fourth Forms have been 
given eight hours for Latin, while the Fifth and Sixth have 
seven. If the eight hours of Latin were restored to the Lower 
Fifth in Prussia, this being the Form where the pupil begins to 
enjoy the reading of Latin, we should be entirely satisfied with 
the present syllabus for the Upper Fifth, considered from the 
point of view of the history teacher.

-P-A-G-E-152
130 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
as that of Herbst, are attempting to meet necessities 
by reducing their length. But no editorial skill can 
entirely overcome the original arrangement. Hence, 
a solution of the difficulty has been found in some 
places which is by no means to be rejected. The 
Third-Form books, which were intended for one year, 
are brought out again. They, at any rate, give the 
master necessary facts, and these are supplemented 
and remodelled as far as this task is possible from 
the standpoint of higher instruction. In any case, 
one caution must be given that is even more neces- 
sary than it was in dealing with the Third Form, 
where the danger is obvious—detailed treatment 
must be avoided of periods for which we are more 
or less reduced to hypotheses. For a long time it 
seems to have been fashionable to treat in full 
detail such subjects as the earlier periods of Roman 
history, the struggle of the classes with full legisla- 
tive details, the struggles with the Italici in the 
three Samnite Wars, etc. It will, however, be 
possible to treat the period before Solon and the 
first period of Roman history until the struggle with 
Carthage even more briefly than in teaching middle 
or lower Forms; while the necessity of working 
through the period in a scanty allowance of time 
will prove a sufficiently strong influence—a Plavos 
6vda0Kanos, aS Thucydides said of war—obliging the 
master to renounce his special hobbies. Among 
these the artistic hobby is prominent at this moment 
—the archeological interest which now seems 
dominant among our leading classes, and demands
-P-A-G-E-153
THE HIGHER STAGES 131 
with some vigour the numerous and splendid objects 
and illustrations required for this purpose. This is 
one of the many excellent things that depend 
entirely upon favourable circumstances—the number 
of the pupils, the personality of the master, the 
endowment of the school, ete.—and upon which 
it is thus impossible to dogmatize from the educa- 
tional point of view. Some thoughtful observations 
were made upon the point in 1892 at the first general 
meeting of the Bavarian Secondary Schoolmasters’ 
Union by Rector Lechner, of Nuremberg: “ How 
far can the plastic arts of antiquity be made a subject 
of school instruction ?” (Freising, 1892). Professor 
Ludwig von Sybel has recently referred to the point 
in Marburg (1904). Upon the whole, we should 
advise teachers not to overestimate the apprecia- 
tion of an Upper-Fifth Form for artistic beauty. 
At this point perhaps we should say a word upon 
the use of these so-called objective methods, which 
in certain cases seem likely to degenerate into actual 
picture-worship. We remember a very true saying 
of Goethe preserved in the life of General Friedrich 
von Gagern by Heinrich von Gagern: “I hate 
luxury, for it destroys imagination.” In our own 
subject especially, an abuse of these objective 
methods tends to stunt the development of that 
imagination which is most important in historical 
teaching. Considerable concentration is required 
to comprehend historical facts, and pictures may 
easily become a distraction, as the immature mind 
seizes, not the whole, but some individual point by 
9— 2
-P-A-G-E-154
  132 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
which it is attracted, or which it abstracts for itself. 
In home reading the case is somewhat different, 
though if a historical book is intended to have an 
educative effect its illustrations must keep a strictly 
historical character, and not be mere products of 
the artist’s imagination. In the reading, too, of 
classical texts we can admit the method to a certain 
extent ; but while teaching we object to the in- 
sertion of historical portraits or anything of the 
kind in school texts at this or any other stage. 
Historical instruction has a great burden to bear, 
and obviously contains within itself the influ- 
ences which have stimulated artistic progress or 
civilization ; but it cannot at the same time become 
a history of art or civilization without losing all 
definition and overflowing all its bounds. 
At this point, however—and we are dealing with 
boys of sixteen or seventeen years of age—we may 
or must use the means of increasing the scanty time 
at our disposal, even though it is a means not entirely 
within our powers or so wholly subject to our will as 
instruction proper. We refer to the question of home 
reading. When the history teacher is confronted by 
an enormous mass of matter for treatment within a 
scanty period of time it is not unreasonable that he 
should ask his boys to read a good book of Greek or 
Roman history for themselves at home. Here we may 
assert emphatically that the business of the classical 
school is to teach the pupils to work for themselves ; 
to teach the boy to grapple with his own tasks, 
which will include the capacity of reading an intel-

RS Ce te RN RE Ree hte eae Te er err 
THE HIGHER STAGES 133 
ligible book upon some subject in connexion with 
his school-work. This stimulus to historical reading 
seems to us to be specially important in the case of 
the upper pupils in our modern schools, as many of 
them may thereby gain an intellectual interest and 
a desire for further culture lasting through life. 
Among the many good things which a teacher can 
do quietly, without writing treatises or articles upon 
the subject in educational papers, is this work of 
inspiring some part of his pupils with an enduring 
taste for good historical reading. 
As regards lecturing to the Form, we think that 
there will be no material difference between the 
mode of treatment employed in the classical school 
and in the corresponding classes of the modern 
school or modern high school. In the case of the 
classical school the earlier and continued reading of 
historical sources will direct the teaching into certain 
lines. It may, for instance, be the political history 
that becomes prominent. While this fact facilitates 
teaching from one point of view, it increases diffi- 
culties from another. On the one hand, this period 
of history is already known to the classical school 
pupils to some extent—better, in fact, than any 
other—for the reason that they have not merely 
heard of the country and the period when these 
things happened, but have to some extent them- 
selves lived in that country and that time; on the 
other hand, a difficulty arises because the teacher 
is constantly tempted to expatiate upon this subject, 
with which he also is more familiar. To the pupils
-P-A-G-E-156
  134 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
of the modern school Greek and Roman history 
should be treated as portions of the world’s history, 
of immense interest and importance as being the 
foundation of that Western culture which is based 
on freedom, but no attempt should be made to 
inspire them with that special interest which 
naturally presupposes such an examination of first- 
hand authorities as only the classical scholar can 
make. On this subject much has been said con- 
cerning the reading or reading aloud of classical 
translations of Homer, Sophocles, and Virgil. We 
cannot speak from experience, but are strongly 
inclined to doubt the effectiveness of such reading. 
At this higher stage, and therefore throughout 
the Upper-Fifth course, the preparation of his lessons 
will make considerable demands upon the teacher, 
or, rather, he should make considerable demands 
upon his own powers. We do not refer to the so- 
called informal lecture of which we have previously 
treated, and which is here assumed throughout the 
upper-school teaching. Suppose, for instance, that 
the history teacher has to deal with a difficult and 
complicated subject, not easy of exposition—for 
example, the circumstances which ended in the 
reforms of the Gracchi or in the French Revolution ; 
suppose, again, that he wished to speak for thirty 
or forty minutes with nothing to guide or support 
his memory, he is reduced either to simply para- 
phrasing the text-book or is asked to perform a feat 
impossible to such famous teachers of history as 
Ranke, von Sybel, Fr. Raumer, and Max Duncker. 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE HIGHER STAGES 135 
Yet it is easier to deliver an informal University 
lecture with a manuscript open before one than to 
do the same thing before the Fifth Form of a classical 
or modern school. The University professor has 
more time for undisturbed preparation. He exists 
for this purpose, and for no other, and can speak 
as he would to his equals in intellect, whereas the 
schoolmaster must accommodate his lecture to 
immature minds. The latter, therefore, must follow 
the counsel of Deedalus, flying neither too high nor 
too low, avoiding both the clouds and the water— 
a matter more easily said than done. Where the 
professor is able to presuppose ideas, the master is 
obliged to analyze these ideas, regardless of apparent 
pedantry. He must commit the great mistake, 
when regarded from the highest historical stand- 
point, of repeating himself; must go over matters 
of importance two or three times in different lan- 
guage and with different expressions. We would 
thus advise the teacher who is undertaking this 
instruction for the first time to analyze for himself 
one good book (not six), written in not too lofty 
or too detailed a style. During the lesson he can 
easily have recourse to his manuscript, from which 
help he will be able to emancipate himself as he 
gains confidence. The objection that the use of a 
manuscript will make a bad impression upon the 
pupils or diminish the “ authority ” of the teacher 
is sheer nonsense. The boy of sixteen or seventeen 
is quite capable of realizing the industry and work 
of his master, and the teacher’s authority is dimin-
-P-A-G-E-158
136 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
ished, not by industry, even when misapplied, but 
rather by glib-tongued obscurity. It must thus be 
remembered that the historical lecture is a more 
difficult matter than any other kind of teaching, 
and the beginner should not attack it with over- 
confidence. Should the master be left in charge 
of this form of instruction for any length of time, 
his knowledge and his analysis will gradually be 
increased from good and first-hand sources of in- 
formation, and he will identify himself more with © 
that world into which he is to introduce his pupils. 
This, indeed, is the true means of vivifying his- 
torical lectures, that the teacher should identify 
himself with the past, whether it be the Persian 
War, the Punic War, the Civil Wars, or the Imperial 
Period. He must live among the men of the age 
of which he treats. It is an object that many do 
not seek, and that not all who seek find. Nowhere, 
we would add, is this spirit of the past reproduced 
with greater strength and freshness than in Niebuhr’s 
lectures upon ancient history, which should be 
studied by every teacher of ancient history for their 
style and general character, even if it be granted 
that in certain respects they are out of date, or that 
the personal view is too prominent in such cases 
as his description of Alexander the Great, when he 
represents Demosthenes as a saint and poor Isocrates 
as an old idiot. The great teacher threw his whole 
powers into these lectures. Apart from this, we 
can but repeat our advice not to read too much of 
what has been written about historical teaching,
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE HIGHER STAGES 137 
but to read the subject-matter of it, and to study 
the history of the past. It is, indeed, difficult to 
master this material which is truly infinite, and so 
to comprehend it that it may really reproduce the 
past while restraining it within the limits dictated 
by our scanty lessons. It is no less easy to talk 
upon the subject, to propose theories of teaching 
and repeat catch-words upon its effects, and espe- 
cially upon its ethical influences. 
Here, as in every stage, it is obvious that regular 
revision or recapitulation of the previous lesson is 
absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, but little 
time will remain from the one year’s course in the 
Upper Fifth for the general revision of each section 
when it has been worked through—the revision, 
that is, of the three or four periods into which Greek 
and Roman history can be divided. We must con- 
sole ourselves with the somewhat inadequate com- 
fort of the fact that the whole course of ancient 
history is a repetition or revision, a deepening or 
extension of the knowledge of ancient history 
acquired from the First Form to the Lower Fifth, 
acquired in some cases by private reading, and 
brought into connexion by the elementary course 
pursued in the Third Form. We are thus given some 
3x 40=120 history lessons, and for these revisions 
we can reserve at most two lessons for each section 
—that is, sixteen altogether. Hence, there will be 
no time left for the elaboration of constitutional 
theory and the like, nor is this latter necessary. 
Enough has been done if the most important facts
-P-A-G-E-160
  138 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
of a period are held in connexion from a fresh point 
of view, and are remodelled with the object of 
proving whether they have been actually understood 
by the majority of the pupils. For instance, take 
the period of Roman history from 264 to 133 B.c. 
In external history, name the most important battles 
of these one hundred and thirty-one years, and 
their dates in chronological order : Myle, Eknomus, 
Panormus, the Aigatian Islands, Telamon, Ticinus, 
Trebia, Trasimene, Canne, Sena, Zama, Cynosce- 
phale, Magnesia, Pydna, the destruction of the three 
cities, Corinth, Carthage, and Numantia ; then the 
extent of the Roman power in 241, 228, 218, 201, 197, 
190, 168, 133 8.c. Then consider the development of 
home politics, the most important statesmen of this 
time, and their party position or other character- 
istics : Regulus, Flaminius, Fabius, Terentius Varro 
and Aimilius Paulus, P. Cornelius Scipio and Cato, 
Flamininus, 4.milius Paulus, ete. Much seems to 
have been done in this direction of late with the 
new method of German essays in brief, which educa- 
tional reformers have urged upon the teaching pro- 
fession, and with which, we fear, many fruitless ex- 
periments must have been made at the outset. We 
cannot promise much advantage to historical in- 
struction from this method; at the same time, 
instead of requiring oral revision of a section, the 
master may set a question or several questions from 
this period to be written out in a straightforward 
manner, and can discover from the answers how 
much actual fact has been remembered, what
-P-A-G-E-161
THE HIGHER STAGES 139 
capacity exists for using known facts, and how 
far his pupils are able to express themselves intel- 
ligibly upon historical subjects. This has always 
been a possible method under any conditions, apart 
from the fact that in the Sixth Form subjects for 
Latin themes have been constantly drawn from 
ancient history, and have proved a very effective 
means of elaborating certain important questions 
when the subjects have been handled with due dis- 
cretion. This point, however, brings us to the 
question of history-teaching in the Sixth Form. 
StxtH Form. 
At the meeting of historical teachers at Leipsic 
in 1894* a motion was adopted to the effect that 
the highest stage of secondary instruction should 
be occupied with modern, especially with German 
history, in preference to the study of ancient history. 
It was scarcely necessary to emphasize the fact, for 
opinion seems fairly agreed that the two last years 
of a secondary school course should be devoted to 
Kuropean history from A.p. 476; that in them the 
larger part of the attention should be given to 
‘modern’ history—that is, history from 1517 on- 
wards; and that time should also be found for the 
period from 1815 to 1871, which the events of 1871 
made productive. It was a representative of strict 
humanism in the Berlin Conference of 1873 who 
* Bericht iiber die zweite Versammlung deutscher Historiker, 
Leipsic, 1894.
-P-A-G-E-162
  140 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
gave emphatic expression for the first time, as far 
as we know, to this somewhat obvious truth. The 
champions of classical school-teaching have been 
unjustly reproached with the desire to throw modern 
history into the background in favour of ancient. 
Such attempts have been purely sporadic. An 
instance between 1860 and 1870 was the zeal with 
which Karl Peter championed the theory that 
ancient history should form the main subject of 
historical teaching in the Sixth Form. Representa- 
tives of the classical schools have always rejected 
this idea, with reference to the principles repeated 
in the above-mentioned motion at Leipsic, that 
“the deeper view of ancient history is essentially 
to be derived from the reading of the classics ’—in 
other words, that the final possibility of realizing 
antiquity at the secondary school should be not 
merely an object, but the chief object, of Sixth-Form 
instruction—an assertion which was formerly better 
justified than now. 
We must again return to those side influences 
which can guide the formation of the historical 
sense at this stage, but we have first to point out 
that in the case of many pupils true scientific in- 
terest is here keen, though not always definite. 
Some will show an eager interest in everything 
worth knowing that comes within their range ; 
others will display a special bias in one direction, 
will study mathematics with zeal and intelligence, 
be careless of linguistic interest, and practically im- 
penetrable to historical influence. In these and
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE HIGHER STAGES 141 
other ways specialist leanings become visible. There 
are also other cases where a very definite leaning 
is displayed to the subject which is to be a speciality 
for life, but where at the same time interest, or at 
any rate conscientious industry, is devoted to other 
subjects, and these are precisely the pupils who will 
bring forth fruit an hundredfold upon the field of 
the secondary school. It is, however, very natural 
that the pupil should himself regard the various 
sciences which he studies as more or less mutually 
independent. Their reaction and interaction natur- 
ally does not cease, and in a sense they become 
more intensive than before ; but these mutual influ- 
ences are less easily regulated in view of the growing 
independence of the pupil, and cannot be guided 
by the fictitious principles of concentration. It is 
imposssible to demand universal perfection in every 
subject from boys of seventeen and eighteen, for 
the reason that at this age the pupil shows a repug- 
nance to what may be called partisan teaching, and 
this fact must be borne in mind in considering our 
own teaching. 
Hence our questions must be formulated in some- 
what different terms than in the previous stages. 
We ask what effect the different subjects of study 
have upon the pupil’s education, and how this 
general educative process affects or is affected by 
historical teaching ? We ask again, What is the 
general product, what is the minimum and maximum 
product, of this teaching in the secondary school ? 
It is obvious that the different subjects of study
-P-A-G-E-164
  142 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
necessarily come in contact with historical instruc- 
tion, but with certain plain differences. Contact 
with mathematics and natural science is, of course, 
very slight, although far-sighted teachers will find 
an opportunity in either case to refer to the ideas 
existing in the ancient world upon the great problems 
of science which we now know by the names of 
Greek derivations as mathematics, physics, the 
cosmos, etc. The teacher will show how discovery 
has advanced very gradually and by no means 
directly, and how all knowledge is connected by a 
universal tie.* An opportunity will be found to 
demonstrate the fact, which modern barbarism 
seems haughtily to reject, that natural science has 
made its vast advance and secured its immense 
influence upon human life merely because numbers 
of disinterested investigators worked without thanks 
and profit for the mere sake of knowledge, and were 
often forced to struggle with prejudice and ob- 
scurantism. It will not be out of place to refer 
briefly to the manner in which astronomy developed 
from astrology and the lofty science of chemistry 
from the search for the philosopher’s stone, and to 
mention the names which forwarded this develop- 
ment. I refer to these facts because I have known 
grown-up youths among the philologists and mathe- 
* Upon this point the Greek reading book of Wilamowitz is 
important, and will doubtless produce its effect, not only directly 
upon the secondary school, but also upon earnest students both 
at the University and in the training colleges among the rising 
generation of teachers.
-P-A-G-E-165
    THE HIGHER STAGES 143 
maticians of my acquaintance who could not entirely 
refrain from casting contemptuous glances at the 
other sciences, without realizing how contemptible 
they were making themselves. Whether at the 
University or at the secondary school, there must 
be mutual respect between the sciences. To borrow 
a striking instance used by a clever philologist, a 
man who writes or can write a dissertation of some 
hundred pages upon the two-celled schizomycetes 
should respect as himself another who can write a 
similar treatise upon a Greek word of two letters, 
av. 'The common duty of all teachers united in one 
corporation is to implant a respect for knowledge 
for its own sake at classical or at modern schools, 
and it is hence that every science derives its nobility 
and its sanctity. Of practical use in the common | 
sense of the word to the majority of men in after- 
life is neither the knowledge of the Pythagorean 
formula nor the rules for constructing conditional 
sentences in Greek, nor the information that Charles 
the Great ruled from A.D. 768 to 814. 
As we have already observed, German literature 
has been recently and _ specially claimed in the 
upper stages as the central point of the general 
instruction given in our secondary schools, while 
the German essay is to be regarded as the strongest 
proof of intellectual maturity. The claim has always 
been justified so far as it is just, and has only been 
obscured at times by incompetent workmen, as may 
happen to any other truth. The task of the teacher 
of German has, by degrees, become many-sided, and
-P-A-G-E-166
  144 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
the success of his teaching depends more than in 
any other subject upon his own individuality. In 
the interest of our own subject, paradoxical as it 
may sound, we welcome the step which has rejected 
the sonorous term “literary history,” and now no 
longer discusses developments, schools of poetry, 
etc., but makes the pupil read the poems and the 
poetry for himself. A habit is thus acquired of 
reading a number of classical works, tragedies, and 
the like, and it is to be hoped that the pupil is 
accordingly stimulated to supplement his school 
literature by home reading. By our position as 
history teachers, occupied with a certain part of 
youthful education, we are also obliged to pay 
attention to the treatment of other school subjects. 
We must accordingly state that too much analysis, 
both of style and matter, seems at the present 
moment to be fashionable in literature lessons. The 
technique of the drama is analyzed, leading figures 
and their contrasts, the main plot and the counter- 
plot, the rise and fall of the action, etc. These 
explanations are actually supported by the use of 
geometrical figures, and even the preaching of the 
Capuchin monk in Wallenstein is now set forth 
with the aid of the Hebrew alphabet. All this 
seems to us to divert attention from that which 
Goethe’s Iphigenie or Schiller’s Wallenstein should 
really be to the young scholar. The great and 
noble thoughts, the interest of human destiny, the 
development of character, the dominating genius in 
conflict with eternal opposition overthrown because
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE HIGHER STAGES 145 
he stains his lofty task by ambition, the purity 
of the woman who breaks the dreadful curse upon 
a family and brings morality to a barbarous people 
—in short, all the nobility of these poems should, 
we think, be brought home to the youthful hearer 
or reader by personal sympathy and appreciation. 
We are concerned little with the artistic form and 
the technique of the drama, but much with its 
material content and the scope of its ideas, from 
which we can expect an influence beneficial upon 
the historical sense, and indirectly upon historical 
learning. It is unnecessary to labour the point. 
Anyone who has fully appreciated the words in 
Wallensteen— 
** When the heart 
Comes not unscathed from out the strife of duty,” ete. 
and the conditions and frame of mind in which 
these words were spoken, has understood an event 
no less historical than the conversion of Henry IV. 
of France in 1593. In every case, though perhaps 
not so immediately as in reading Schiller’s Maria 
Stuart, the Sixth-Form boy will feel that he is re- 
ceiving an education in history, and that every 
immediate presentation of fact, including that given 
by immortal poetry, will deepen his knowledge of 
the past. At the same time, if he proceeds to read 
our great poems from a different point of view than 
that of pure history, he will gain a deeper know- 
ledge of the tragical elements in historical events, 
such as the condemnation of John Huss by a 
reforming council. There is yet another external 
10
-P-A-G-E-168
  146 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
point in close connexion with the former. The 
capacity to reproduce somewhat complicated his- 
torical events in educated language, reproduction 
implying something more than mere repetition, is 
but little developed, even at this stage. The defi- 
ciency is only natural, for the task is very difficult. 
The German literature lesson, therefore, sharpens 
and improves the pupil’s linguistic power, and en- 
riches his historical vocabulary. 
The same facts are true mutatis mutandis, for the 
modern schools. The special duty and, we may 
add, the special pleasure of the master who is in 
charge of the literary studies of a modern Sixth 
chiefly consists in the fact that he can give his 
pupils some compensation for the initial advantages 
which the classical schoolboy enjoys, and the same 
facts are true of the religious instruction. 
To this latter subject we need add very little to 
the observations already made at the different stages, 
and especially in dealing with the Upper Fifth. I 
can only speak of the Protestant divinity teaching. 
Catholic teaching, so far as my experience has gone, 
appears chiefly directed to providing the pupils with 
a simple system of apologetics, and thus cannot 
have the effect that we here desire, though I am far 
from pronouncing any general criticism of the system. 
The periods of divinity set down for Sixth-Form study 
in every German State, and not in Prussia alone, 
comprise great historical periods of Church history 
—the history of the first three centuries, the most 
important movements in medieval Church history, 
the history of the Reformation, the most important
-P-A-G-E-169
    THE HIGHER STAGES 147 
tendencies of the post-Reformation period ; hence, 
from the very nature of the subject, this teaching 
can effectively supplement and deepen the historical 
instruction. The important point is, however, not 
so much the acquisition of this knowledge or its 
wider outlook, but the fact that this instruction 
should teach the young man to regard himself as a 
lively member of a corporation, historical in the 
deepest sense, a member of the Christian Church 
and of the community of Christ, which reaches back 
for centuries, and points the way for centuries to 
come. We assumed at the outset that historical 
comprehension, and therefore historical training, 
was only possible when the conception of humanity 
as an ethical whole had been grasped, this con- 
ception implying an idea and consciousness of God 
as its necessary correlative. This principle now 
becomes of greater importance in so far as the seeds 
already sown in the First and Second Forms have 
been watered and have grown. Thus much, at least, 
should have been secured in every case by religious 
jnstruction, that the idea of the kingdom of God has 
become a reality. “ This man is not far from the 
kingdom of God,”’ says Jesus of one of the scribes who 
asked the supreme law of action ; but mere knowledge 
of the kingdom does not imply membership. To 
express the matter in secular terms, religious instruc- 
tion provides the pupils of the upper Forms with a 
philosophy of history and with something that 
supplies a philosophic impulse or a philosophic 
leaven to their historical knowledge. 
10—2
-P-A-G-E-170
    148 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
This, however, is not enough for life, and his- 
torical or religious knowledge will only bring forth 
dead fruit unless it can affect the action of man- 
kind. Of these facts we are well aware, as we are 
of the special mission of religious instruction in this 
respect. The divinity lesson has only fulfilled its 
purpose if the pupils, few or many, have not merely 
learnt, for instance, the circumstances which pro- 
duced the Augsburg Confession of Faith, but have 
also realized in heart and intellect and will that 
God requires from all who regard this confession as 
their creed the same courage as the men of that 
blessed period displayed, and which the men of our 
own time will also need in their conflict with lies 
and half lies. | 
As regards linguistic study, whether of ancient 
or modern languages, it is obvious that the more 
easily the Sixth-Form boy can read a foreign lan- 
guage, the more rapidly will his historical powers 
be developed by such reading; while everything 
that diminishes this facility; whether it be gram- 
matical pedantry or the dilettantism more fashion- 
able at this moment, will manifest its evil effects 
at this point in particular. Here we must speak of 
the so-called source-books which are in existence. 
These were at first compiled, and with good 
reason, for the purposes of ancient history, but the 
idea has also been applied to medieval and modern 
history. We have always feared that the method 
might introduce an unnecessary distraction into the 
organization of historical teaching, and we doubt if 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE HIGHER STAGES 149 
the experiment has been successful where it has been 
tried ; but as we have no time for such luxuries, it 
is scarcely necessary to speak further upon the 
matter. The only study that can really be called 
the reading of sources is the regular reading of the 
classical texts. The classical authors are historical 
sources at every stage of school-life, and more than 
ever at this highest stage. Historians such as Livy, 
Sallust, Tacitus, Xenophon, Thucydides, either give 
us records of a past which was to them a present, 
and in any case was vivid to them as it can never 
be to us, or they reflect the spirit, the intellectual 
and moral views of their time as do the poets Homer, 
Sophocles, and Horace ; or if they be orators like 
Cicero, or Demosthenes they introduce us to great 
affairs of State or private life. To read the first 
Philippic with a class and to make it clear to them, 
means to explain the situation of the political world 
as it was about the time of the birth of Alexander 
the Great. In this atmosphere the pupil lives, and 
its historical interest and standpoint provide us with 
a magician’s wand by which we can change to gold 
all that comes in connexion with this study. Take, 
for instance, the Philip of Isocrates—a work of very 
moderate literary value, like all productions of that 
limited mind. For us and for boys of eighteen it 
forms an invaluable historical document, intro- 
ductory to the political ideas and the intellectual 
movements existing at the outset of the monarchical 
Macedonian or Hellenistic age. This interest can 
never be entirely extinguished by the most incom- 
   
-P-A-G-E-172
  150 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
petent teaching, while it can become extraordinarily 
efficacious in the hands of a teacher who has any 
feeling for history. If we take an average case, and 
consider a document that is not specially calculated 
to produce the effect which we desire, take a Form 
of boys from seventeen to twenty years of age who 
have read throughout a winter the fourth or fifth 
Verrine oration. They have gained a clear concep- 
tion of the life of a Roman provincial population in 
the first century B.c., and can realize for themselves 
the locality and the age. This realizing a piece of 
the past as a present by means of its records is just 
what history, historical study, and historical know- 
ledge mean. This is neither paradoxical nor new, 
but is immediately enlightening. Yet it is notorious 
that educational methods very often miss this 
obvious point. It may even be asserted that failure 
to recognize this plain truth and the unhistorical 
treatment of the classical languages and their litera- 
ture is to blame for the evil influences which threaten 
to shatter the whole of our secondary educational 
system. ‘To prove our point, and to show what we 
mean when we say that classical literature in our 
schools is really the reading of historical sources, 
we need only refer to Horace. No classical author 
is more valuable to the historian than this little 
book. The odes, the satires, the epistles, and the 
epodes everywhere provide numberless pictures from 
the daily life of Rome, the life, too, of the common 
people, and not merely of the upper ten thousand. 
Horace shows us the secondary school of the Italian
-P-A-G-E-173
THE HIGHER STAGES 151 
provincial town, the auditorium of the magister at 
Rome, university life at Athens, and the street life 
of the capital. We see the crier Mena and the 
petit pewple in their short sleeves, the popellus 
tunicatus, every order and profession of society— 
clerks and officers, estate agents, surly scholars, 
princes of the imperial house, needy philosophers 
and poetasters, political, legal, and social life, 
literary tendencies and cliques—these pass before 
our eyes, and are depicted by a keen observer, born 
in freedom, educated in a Greco-Roman corner of 
Italy, personally connected with the great political 
revolution, and brought by his own talents, tact, 
and good fortune into immediate connexion with the 
rulers and leaders of the nation. All this can be 
learnt from Horace, and can be learnt by the school- 
boy whose interests and sympathies have not been 
blunted. It is not difficult, and requires no special 
art, thus to study Horace witha Form. The teacher 
is not asked to sacrifice any essential interests or 
special hobby of his own, though he must abandon 
attempts to enlarge upon the metrical system of the 
odes or attempts to classify their form. Well for 
him and for his pupils if he can succeed in the effort. 
At this point we should like to say a word in 
passing upon a subject which is commonly regarded 
as unconnected with that historical training which 
gives the classical school its true individuality. We 
refer to translation from German into the classical 
languages. It is a practice in little favour with that 
dilettantism which objects to serious work and is
-P-A-G-E-174
  
  152 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
too often a leading influence in questions of schoo! 
policy. We can hardly suppose that the short- 
sighted persons who follow this fashion can have 
any idea of the value of the practice. Translation 
into the ancient languages avoids that superficiality 
which seems to characterize its opponents by forcing 
_the translator to think in the spirit of the men whe 
gave expression to their thoughts two thousand 
years ago by means of a fundamentally different 
language, and holding the opinions of another age. 
To any linguistic expert it is obvious that transla- 
tion from the mother-tongue into a foreign language 
implies a far closer acquaintance with the latter 
than the reverse process, and that the language of a 
nation during a definite period preserves the mental! 
attitude of the nation and of the time, and is thus 
far a subject of study essentially historical. The 
fact is true even in schools, and when a boy is 
obliged to consider whether he shall translate the 
word “foreigner” by peregrinus, hospes, advena, 
barbarus, by Eévos or Bap8apos, he learns a number 
of ideas by no means unimportant which were pre- 
valent in the classical period. The last of these 
words is, indeed, of high importance to the history 
of civilization, and the teacher can very well afford 
to spend a moment upon it. 
Modern languages—French and English of the 
present day—do not, and cannot, produce this effect, 
and a capable student can never learn from them 
what he can learn from Horace or Homer concerning 
human life regarded from the historical point of 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
    THE HIGHER STAGES 153 
view. Yet they, too, make a contribution to what 
is known as general education, though much of this 
consists of practical or useful information. Some 
portion, however, does concern the past, and is, 
therefore, an influence upon historical training. 
We have already observed in reference to modern 
languages that we do not share the rising objection 
to books of selections. We would gladly see in the 
hands of the pupils books of French or English 
extracts, not merely well chosen, but also compre- 
hensive in character. Those of Plotz or Herrig 
both seem very suitable for this purpose. Probably 
hardly a third of them can be read in school, but a 
considerable proportion of the pupils, when the 
instruction is inspired by genuine interest on the 
master’s part, will read the remainder, or much 
of it, for themselves. The pupil who does this will 
advance his historical culture as follows: In the 
first place, the leading figures of French national 
literature—Racine, Moliére, Voltaire, Rousseau, ete. 
—will be something more to him than mere 
names; in the second place, he will learn for what 
reason French literature so long outstripped our 
own, until the middle of the eighteenth century, 
when the German spirit began to realize itself. 
Thirdly, he will involuntarily make a constant com- 
parison between his own nation and the foreign 
nation, and by considering their respective advan- 
tages and defects will improve his power of judg- 
ment. This we consider is very requisite in the 
formation of the historical sense, and a valuable
-P-A-G-E-176
  154 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
means of increasing it. Fourthly, he will extend his 
intellectual horizon; and fifthly, he will learn to 
respect the special advantages of French historical 
science and narrative, or at any rate will be im- 
pressed by these. We do not propose to discuss in 
what manner French should be taught in secondary 
schools, but this advantage is incomparably higher 
than the capacity to use the velar palate with 
certainty or to order a beef-steak in France without 
raising a smile upon the face of the waiter. Of 
high importance, too, even from the point of view 
we have mentioned, is the practice of translation 
into French, and our limited capacities are totally 
unable to comprehend the regulations of the Prussian 
syllabus for 1892, which stipulates that from the 
Upper Fifth downwards written translations should 
be made only from French into German, and not 
vice versa; nor can we understand why many of 
our authorities on modern language teaching object 
to a practice that seems to us so entirely obvious. 
English does not seem so beneficial for our 
special purpose as French—at any rate, in the 
classical school. In the modern school English will 
always be of importance, even with reference to the 
historical training of the pupils ; but in the classical 
school English is optional, and is in the experimental 
stage, so that probably only the most competent 
teachers will succeed in securing any considerable 
number of pupils. The chief objection is that the 
English language is too nearly akin to the German, 
both in point of view and expression. Gibbon,
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE HIGHER STAGES 155 
Macaulay, Lecky, Prescott, even McCarthy, Hallam, 
Stanhope, etc., are good or some of them great 
historians ; Carlyle’s Cromwell, his French Revolution, 
and his Frederick the Great are works of high origin- 
ality and genius ; but the reader, even if he be of 
mature years and entire master of English, will lose 
very little if he reads these works in a French or 
German translation. Even Milton loses but little 
in German, and only of Shakespeare can it be said 
that he must be read in English if his spirit is to be 
entirely grasped, and that his influence upon the 
formation of the historical sense is far greater if he 
be read in the original than in the most excellent 
of translations. As regards later study, the case 
is different. English at school produces no real 
benefit until later, and is intended to be continued 
in after-life, its educational value being but small 
at the outset ; whereas Latin, Greek, and, to a less 
degree, French exert a strong educative influence 
even upon those who may find no special use for 
them in later official or professional life. 
Such, then, is the intellectual pabulum of the 
Sixth-Form boy, in addition to that provided by 
the three lessons of historical teaching proper. Geo- 
graphy we no longer regard as a special subject 
after a boy leaves the Upper Fifth. Apart from so- 
called physical geography, its importance has been 
absorbed by history. We have already spoken of 
the recent demand in Prussia for twenty-four 
geography revisions of three lessons a week. These 
we consider little more than a side dish upon the bill
-P-A-G-E-178
156 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
of fare. We have two years before us, with three 
lessons a week, and our subject is history from A.D. 
476 to 1871, with the possible addition of a summary 
to 1888 or 1900. Fortunately, we need not discuss 
what ultimate goal will be accepted by posterity 
in five hundred years. Sufficient unto the day is 
the evil thereof ! 
The wide extent of the matter for treatment is 
the first tangible obstacle. This is, in truth, a great 
difficulty at any stage of secondary-school instruction, 
and especially at this upper stage, as full knowledge 
and the completion of the period set is reasonably ~ 
demanded. The system of distribution has become 
almost conventional. It is official in Prussia, and 
has been adopted in most of the syllabuses of the 
other German States. It is as follows: During the 
first year medieval history to 1517, and, according 
to the Prussian syllabus, the part of modern history 
from 1517 to 1648. Thus, a whole year is left for 
the period from 1648 to 1871 (1888 or 1900 or 1904), 
the two final periods of modern history, according 
to the traditional mode of revision. Here, too, 
‘information concerning our social and economic 
development ”’ should also be treated. 
As regards this division, it must be said that it 
involves the danger of adding another burden to 
the task of the history master, which is already 
unduly heavy. Every period has its prominent 
ideas and special interests, which naturally affect 
the history teaching in the higher schools. Thus, 
the religious and dogmatic point was prominent in
-P-A-G-E-179
  THE HIGHER STAGES 157 
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, literary 
and zsthetic considerations dominated the close of 
the preceding century, while philosophical interests 
were paramount between 1820 and 1830, the age 
when Hegel’s philosophy held the field. At the 
present moment social and economic developments 
are the leading interest or catch-word. It is natural 
and right that these matters should now be given 
a first place in our historical works.* Many history 
teachers in secondary schools, without waiting for 
any ministerial decree upon the point, have given 
full weight in their teaching to these realistic 
points in order to keep in touch with the national 
life. For this very reason it is advisable to warn 
younger colleagues against exaggeration, since these 
points have now received official countenance, 
though they were formerly regarded askance. The 
subject was discussed by the fifth meeting of head 
masters in the Rhine Conference (1893), and also 
by similar meetings in other Prussian provinces, 
upon the basis of careful reports. It was very 
properly asserted that instruction in this subject 
is not an end in itself, but should be given only in 
the closest organic connexion with history teaching 
as it proceeds in chronological order. The motions 
adopted are marked by the usual idealism and high- 
* For instance, in the brilliant and stimulating work of Lam- 
precht, which will be occasionally referred to in the discussion 
of our subject. From Lamprecht’s German history the teacher 
will find much that is stimulating, and his teaching will benefit 
indirectly, but not directly. We must therefore advise our 
younger colleagues to approach this subject with great caution.
-P-A-G-E-180
  158 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
flown phraseology ; the particular should be raised 
to the sphere of the universal, etc., but these out- 
growths have been restrained within due limits. 
All school instruction is educative, and it will, 
therefore, suffice, when the social or economic con- 
ditions of a period are in question, that the teacher 
should give his pupils clear conceptions and not 
empty words. He will, at any rate, discover that 
it is by no means easy to bring home to the com- 
prehension of boys matters that seem entirely 
simple, such as the difference between allodiwm 
and beneficium, or the relation between money and 
credit when he expounds the bankruptcy of Laws 
in 1720. In this connexion we must also object 
to the idea which would make it the duty of school 
history teaching to oppose socialist aberrations. 
There is no great danger that the ranks of the social 
democrats will be strengthened by pupils from 
those classes of society which support our secondary 
schools, while any introduction of this political 
question with a definite purpose of opposition might 
easily produce a contrary effect upon immature 
minds. Social democracy is by no means a new 
phenomenon; we have seen it at the helm of the 
State in 1793 and in 1871, and enough is done when 
the cases are mentioned as historical facts; the 
application of the facts can be left to the pupils 
themselves and to the future. In these higher stages 
historical teaching cannot permit digressions; its 
quiet progress must accustom the learner to adopt 
a historical standpoint and thus provide him with 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  THE HIGHER STAGES 159 
the best means of gaining a further and deeper 
knowledge of social and economic conditions ; this 
will be the best weapon with which to combat social 
democratic and other revolutionary movements. 
Here, too, we would expressly state that we 
adopt temporarily as a concluding point of detailed 
historical study in the secondary school the year 
1871—the restoration or revival of the German 
national State. We believe that most history 
teachers, like ourselves, will be profoundly thankful 
when they have really reached this goal. An hour 
or two may be left for a short chronicle of events 
until 1888, or to the “ present time,”’ 7.e., in the strict 
sense of the term, to the very moment at which the 
master is giving the lesson. Events subsequent to 
1871 are certainly history, but cannot be strictly 
taught or learnt as such. Take the case of an 
Old-Catholic, or Protestant, or Roman Catholic 
master, who has lived through the history of the 
last thirty years, or any part of it, with full 
appreciation of its importance; it would be im- 
possible for such a man to relate the ecclesiastical 
struggles which are essential to the comprehension 
of this period with the calm impartiality which 
is expected of the history teacher in the secondary 
school. 
After this preliminary discussion we will pro- 
ceed, as previously, to treat severally of the text- 
book, the lecture, and the revision, and to indicate 
the modifications required by the age and develop- 
ment of the pupils concerned.
-P-A-G-E-182
. 
160 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Herbst was the first to emphasize the essential 
point that the text-book should observe its due 
limits, and should be nothing more than an auxiliary ; 
in itself it should be of no importance, and must not 
take the butter from the teacher’s bread. While 
true of every Form, this is especially true of the 
Sixth. The text-book must contain historical 
material in brief form, well arranged, easy to refer 
to, and readily intelligible. Those who propose to 
provide the world with new books of this kind 
might take as a model of style the works of 
old Spittler—now out of date, but masterly per- 
formances in this and other respects—especially 
his works upon Church history and the history of 
the European States. The same remarks apply 
detractis detrahendis to Hase’s ecclesiastical text- 
book for University lecturers. The book must be 
so arranged as to make a tabular chart of events 
superfluous ; at the same time it must be so full as 
to enable the teacher to treat certain portions with 
close reference to the text, and thus to gain time 
for more detailed treatment of those parts which 
his studies and his practical experience enable him 
to expound at greater length. 
No special rules can be given for the use of the 
text-book by the teacher as to closeness of the con- 
nexion he should maintain with it while lecturing ; 
he should not criticize or contradict his text-book—as 
often happens—for the pupil must not be taught to 
despise his books. The nearer, however, we 
approach the University stage, the more independent 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
    THE HIGHER STAGES 161 
must be the position of the master. In view of the 
scantiness of the time and the fact that he is required 
to complete the period, he must not be content to 
go through the text-book simply paragraph by 
paragraph. In my youth and in my home at 
Wurtemburg a common question among first-term 
students was, with whom and how one had learnt 
history ; and the statement that one or another 
history master had lectured independently of the 
book was received with a kind of surprise as an 
extraordinary phenomenon. Kiesel* in his report 
upon history teaching—which we have no hesita- 
tion in pronouncing the most careful and readable 
report which we know—makes an acute and some- 
what malicious observation, that wherever ° the 
merits of historical teaching are discussed, indepen- 
dent lecturing is regarded as indispensable—a, state- 
ment in pleasing contrast to much actual experi- 
ence. The contrast would be even more pleasing 
if more were done and less demanded in this respect 
within reasonable liniits. Elsewhere [I have ob- 
served that the best teacher of history I have known 
—Christian Marklin (died at Heilbronn in 1848)— 
did not lecture independently, but worked at his 
history with constant industry, reading from a 
detailed manuscript which was admirable both in 
form and content, and producing by this means and 
by force of character an effect the depth of which still 
is visible to me and to many of his pupils. The term

  (162 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
‘independent ” or “informal” lecture is wholly 
relative; if the University teacher can have a 
manuscript or full notes before him there is no 
reason why the schoolmaster should not follow the 
same procedure, seeing that his task is no easier. 
After fifty years’ experience, I could not pledge my- 
self to lecture at any moment without any assistance 
whatever from notes upon some complex historical 
subject, such as the preliminary causes of the French 
Revolution ; nor would I perform the feat if I could. 
Demands and regulations in this instance are worth- 
less, so easy-is it to invent fine phrases upon this 
subject. 
It is unnecessary to expound the other advantages 
which the lecture should have—clarity, vivacity, 
patriotic or religious warmth and enthusiasm. We 
will content ourselves by offering to our younger 
colleagues the homely advice that they should use 
short sentences and as few substantives as possible, 
confining themselves to concrete terms. Such is the 
advice of G. Riimelin, a clear and strong thinker 
to whom we and the text-books of Herbst owe this 
principle, which we have found sound and practical. 
In entering into details about the two years’ course 
for the Sixth Form we are well aware that our obser- 
vations are less impartial and rather more a matter 
of personal opinion than they have hitherto been. 
None the less, we may be able to give useful hints 
to younger teachers, and to enable them to avoid 
mistakes from the experience of our own errors and 
those of others, and by what we have learnt from the
-P-A-G-E-185
    THE HIGHER STAGES 163 
skill of others and in our own search for the right 
method. 
The first year in the Lower Sixth will be occupied 
by medieval and a portion of modern history ; we 
consider it impossible and inadvisable to continue 
this latter to 1648, and will be content to reach 
1555 or 1618 at the utmost. For medieval history 
the indispensable minimum of time is that from 
Easter to Christmas ; in the succeeding three months 
it is impossible to treat with any fullness the im- 
portant century of the Reformation—a European 
event which determined the future history of every 
country —together with the first half of the following 
century, including the Thirty Years’ War. The 
period is too wide for that detailed treatment which 
is not merely desirable, but necessary. For false 
views upon the course of these events have increased 
and become powerful in Germany, since the first 
edition of this book. 
Medieval history can and should be treated 
primarily as German history ; theoretical recognition 
of this fact is so universal that we need not labour 
the point. Some two lessons will be devoted to the 
‘* pre-history ”’ of the Teutonic nationality ; it will 
be assumed that the Upper Fifth have secured a 
general view of the history of the Roman Empire : 
it is unnecessary, for instance, that the campaigns 
of Drusus and Germanicus should be severally im- 
pressed upon the pupil’s memory. The conditions 
applicable to Greek and Roman history hold good 
here, and we shall, therefore, not delay unduly over 
11—2  
-P-A-G-E-186
  164 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
the hypothetical history of primitive times. What 
is certainly known of the primitive life of the 
Teutonic tribes can soon be narrated ; moreover, 
the Upper Sixth will shortly be reading the Germania 
of Tacitus, and can then secure all necessary in- 
formation upon the social and economic development 
of that period. The Roman imperial power in this 
connexion will be briefly treated as preliminary to 
medieval German history, and we shall not be led 
astray by the demand for a detailed treatment of 
Roman imperial history. On this subject Harnack 
made some useful observations in the discussions 
and proceedings of the Berlin Conference of June, 
1900 (Verhandlungen, p. 364 f and 145 ff.). He 
suggests that our treatment should include “ under 
the imperial age, the rise of Christianity, the tension 
between Church and State, the gradual amalgama- 
tion of Christianity with the intellectual culture of 
the ancient world, and the eventual harmony 
between the two—the whole to be related from the 
standpoint of universal history, with reference to 
the most important literary monuments.” If this 
is possible at all in secondary schools, it belongs to 
the divinity lesson. 
Odoacer can be dismissed in a few sentences ; on 
the other hand, our sources of information permit 
us to construct a more definite picture of the brilliant 
period of the Gothic supremacy in Italy, including 
the kingdom of Theoderich, the heroic struggles 
of the nation, and the Byzantine restoration. 
Chlodwig and the special brand of theology on which 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  THE HIGHER STAGES 165 
his conversion is based may be similarly treated. It 
will, however, be advisable in dealing with Frankish 
history up to the time of Charles Martell or Charles 
the Great to confine ourselves to a short and definite 
outline of the period; no amount of description 
will enable the schoolboy to understand the char- 
acteristic feature of the period, the fusion of the 
traditional Roman culture with the institutions of 
Teutonic barbarism. On the other hand, the 
genius of Islam, its doctrine and morality, and the 
fantastic or mythological elements attached to 
Mohammed’s teaching, should be sufficiently de- 
tailed to provide a clear idea of the influence which 
this very remarkable religion has exerted upon the 
world. The history of its first conquests in Europe 
and of the decisive conflict in 732 is naturally con- 
nected with the rise of the new Frankish dynasty 
and of the papal authority, the origin and growth 
of which as a great moral authority must be de- 
veloped from an objective standpoint. Even a 
Protestant will recognize the growth of this power 
as something providential ; it is not the business of 
the history master directly to oppose the theory 
that the Papacy was an institution immediately 
created by God—a theory untenable by the scien- 
tific historian. The master will confine himself to 
a detailed account of papal development, and will 
thus attain his object. We may observe in general 
that here and elsewhere all polemical treatment of 
these medieval conceptions, which still retain 
much of their force, is to be avoided. Such methods 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  166 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
are unnecessary for Protestant and Jewish pupils, 
and in the case of Catholics are more likely to bar 
the way to a true appreciation of the facts ; whereas 
it should be our business to keep the possibility of 
such appreciation open by a narrative conducted, as 
far as possible, sine ira et studio. The conquests of 
Charles the Great should be treated summarily, and 
his governmental work in greater fullness, in oppo- 
sition to the usual method in vogue ; some economic 
teaching within the comprehension of the school- 
boy can be derived from this subject. The further 
history of the ninth century—the ayevnva capnva of 
the Carolingians—will be given very shortly, and 
also the history of Conrad I. and Henry I. ; a fuller 
narrative will be required of the Saxon dynasty 
until 1024. But here undue elaboration must be 
avoided ; the struggles of Otto I. with his revolted 
brothers and sons remain as vague to the pupil as 
do the leading figures, of whom no clear picture can 
be gained. More definite characterization is pos- 
sible in dealing with the imposing figure of Otto L., 
but little in the case of Otto III. and Henry II., 
and none in the case of Otto IT. When the most 
necessary information has been given we must 
explain, before proceeding further, what achieve- 
ments had been made in Germany up to that point ; 
the repulse of the marauding peoples, the new sense 
of union with Italy and with East Rome, and the 
great advance of civilization. Bruno, the great 
Bishop, stands out with some precision in our 
sources of information, and shows us the medieval
-P-A-G-E-189
THE HIGHER STAGES 167 
Church of the tenth century in a highly creditable 
and attractive light. In the following period a new 
difficulty arises ; the culminating point is reached in 
the religious quarrel and conflict between Henry IV. 
and Gregory VII. The impartiality of the history 
master will find opportunity for exercise in re- 
storing the true picture of these two opponents, 
whose characters have been falsified or distorted 
by contemporary partisans. I know that at the 
present day, as in my youth, fifty years ago, teachers 
are accustomed to enlarge upon the insult inflicted 
upon the German kingdom at Canossa; the truth 
is that Henry IV., by his penance and by the 
absolution he thereby secured, gained an undoubted 
victory over Gregory, while the penance, which was 
performed in the traditional manner, was certainly 
not calculated to degrade him in the eyes of his con- 
temporaries. One obstacle which confronts us 
throughout the Middle Ages we cannot entirely 
overcome ;. it is impossible for us to sympathize 
with the theory of a “visible invisible’ world, 
which brought the invisible world into immediate 
connexion with the visible to an even greater extent 
than was ever possible in classical times. We must, 
therefore, confine ourselves to facts, being careful 
to use the advantage which such history as that of 
the First Crusade will offer when these facts are 
given to us with a certain epic abundance. 
The next period, covering from the Crusades to 
Rudolf of Hapsburg, provides far greater oppor- 
tunity for characterization and individual detail ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-190

instances are Frederick Barbarossa, Frederick 11. 
in particular, Henry IV. if necessary, Bernard o° 
Clairvaux, Alexander III., and Innocent IV. Ever 
after reading the very detailed work of Giese- 
brecht—the seven volumes of which do not reat! 
the death of Frederick I.—or after working throug! 
the three thousand pages of Albert Hauck’s im 
mense and important work upon the ecclesiastica. 
history of Germany, we shall, none the less, be forced 
to admit that the medieval world is essentially alicr 
to our comprehension, and that vivid and realistic , 
description—the most fruitful part of our instruc- 
tion—is only possible here to a very modera*s 
extent. Formerly the period of the Hohenstaufer 
was regarded as an excellent opportunity for arousing 
patriotic enthusiasm and producing an ethical effec! 
when dealing with medieval German history 
Upon this subject, however, we have grown gradually 
stricter, and require for every kind of historica 
narrative, including secondary school teaching, ths 
facts as they actually happened, apart from an) 
artificial colouring, and we are making a sharpe! 
distinction than before between ethical and pathetic 
effects. At the same time this period of history is 
by no means lacking in opportunities for idealism. 
and these are to be found, as the term implies, in 
the ideas inspiring the men of the period. In one 
respect this period from the Crusades to the Inter- 
regnum has something of the highest ethical value in 
it. Though these men were intellectually so narrow- 
minded, so uncultured, and so limited, yet they were 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
    THE HIGHER STAGES ie 
superior to ourselves in-one point: they could 
s»crifice their personal comfort, and even their lives, 
bo an idea. 
The master’s most difficult task is probably the 
‘ast period—the close of the Middle Ages, from 
Rudolf of Hapsburg to Luther’s declaration—and 
especially difficult is the early portion—the end of 
the thirteenth century and the whole of the four- 
teenth. Here we should advise very summary 
treatment, in order that as much time as possible 
may be secured for the highly important fifteenth 
century. In this case ecclesiastical affairs again 
»ecome prominent ; the problem which confronted 
usin the Fourth Form here becomes more serious, as 
-are dealing with pupils of greater power, and this 
. difficulty or a task which is not to be dismissed 
n a few vague generalities. The ecclesiastical 
position which divides the nation at the present 
began then, and the Church movement of the 
enth century gave it a form which is obvious 
‘on to the modern schoolboy ; hence we have to 
‘ace the fact that we are teaching pupils of different 
-eeds—that is to say, pupils whose attitude towards 
‘hese matters is very different, by reason of their 
ome training and other influences of the kind. 
en in teaching for a considerable period a Sixth 
“orm, composed of the two religious creeds in equal 
vroportions, has the characteristic question occurred 
to me, How can it be possible to teach Catholic 
and Protestant schoolboys modern history by pre- 
cisely similar methods? The answer is simple
-P-A-G-E-192
170 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
enough : we are teaching history, and not theology ; 
but practice is by no means so easy. The chief law 
for the teacher is in every case to tell the truth, 
which, in practical dealing, implies that he should 
not implant false ideas. A second command con- 
tained within the first, as the love of one’s neighbour 
is implied by the love of God, is to say no more 
than the pupil can understand—no more than is, 
or can become, the truth to him. In these cases, 
if anywhere, prudence is the mother of wisdom, 
until the teacher’s wisdom becomes the mother of 
his prudence, and the critical moment when he 
must remember this fact does not occur when 
dealing with the Reformation and its results, but 
when dealing with the council movement of the 
fifteenth century, and especially with the trial of 
Huss. My long experience of Sixth-Form teaching 
in a school where the two creeds are represented 
has convinced me that it is advisable to say a few 
plain words to the Form when beginning the dis- 
cussion of this period. I usually say that we are 
now entering upon a period when the existing 
opposition between Catholicism and Protestantism 
also becomes important in the narration of historical 
events ; that if any of my Catholic pupils should 
feel themselves offended by any points of my 
narrative, I should be glad if they would say so, 
and I would then lend them a narrative written from 
the Catholic point of view, which they can read for 
purposes of comparison (for instance, in the case 
of the Protestant Leo). I then proceed to urge
-P-A-G-E-193
  THE HIGHER STAGES 171 
that in the teaching of history it is not our business 
to discover whether Catholicism or Protestantism 
be more correct, whether Huss or the majority of 
the Council of Constance, whether Luther or the 
old Church, were respectively justified ; our task is 
to expound to the best of our power what actually 
happened. I then proceed to the task of narrative, 
and describe the trial of Huss as I have long ago 
conceived it, and as it is now generally regarded, 
representing it as a tragical conflict between two 
forces : on the one hand the majority of the Council 
which was honestly anxious to reform the Church, 
and equally anxious to maintain the principles of its 
fathers and its dogmatic system ; on the other hand, 
an individual Christian of somewhat limited views, 
but entirely honourable, who had seceded from the 
Church unconsciously in virtue of the principle 
“That the man commissioned by God to preach 
must preach unhindered by episcopal or papal 
excommunication ’’; a man who was thus a dan- 
gerous heretic in the eyes of his opponents—the 
more so as in this and other points he declined to 
submit to the authority of the Council, the highest 
authority of which these men could conceive. I 
have then been accustomed to conclude by telling 
the Form, whose attentiveness at this stage is usually 
remarkable, that we are not called upon to decide 
which of the two opposing parties held the correct 
theoretical view, but that it is our business to 
understand this special fact—that a man who might 
have saved himself with a word preferred to die
-P-A-G-E-194
  172 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
for his moral convictions because he could not con- 
scientiously pronounce that word of recantation ; 
every one of us, whether he be Catholic or Pro- 
- testant, here has an example of high fidelity to 
conviction. I might add that, though in a position 
extremely open to attack, I have never experi- 
enced the smallest unpleasantness arising from my 
historical instruction. 
This question becomes more acute—-or, let us say, 
more serious—to the conscientious and truthful 
teacher when he begins the section usually known 
as “modern history” in a special sense. The 
fact is obvious at the outset. A large number of 
text-books, chiefly composed by Catholics, though 
some emanate from Protestant authors, make the 
year 1453—the ‘Conquest of Constantinople by 
the Ottoman Turks ”—the starting-point of modern 
history, or take the year 1492—the discovery of 
America. Either alternative is demonstrably false. 
The conquest of Constantinople is a highly im- 
portant event, but not universally so; the revival 
of humanism by the scattered Greeks is an important 
influence upon a movement which is gradually 
fulfilling its purpose, but is, again, not of decisive 
importance to the fate of nations. The discovery 
of America belongs to a general view of the his- 
tory of discovery, and will conclude the history 
of medieval discovery ; it is not an epoch-making 
event, opening one of the great divisions of the 
history of the world. It is rather an occurrence 
without immediate influence of wide effect; of
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE HIGHER STAGES 173 
importance to universal history the new continent 
did not become until considerably later, for, though 
discovered in 1492, it was not explored at that time. 
On the other hand, the event which happened on 
October 31, 1517, was, in spite of its apparent 
insignificance, to dominate succeeding centuries 
until the present time, and to determine the life of 
individuals and of European nations; we refer to 
the words of Thomas Carlyle upon this subject—one 
of the most far-sighted historical observers of the 
nineteenth century.* To adopt this wholly prac- 
tical and objective standpoint for “‘ modern history ”’ 
for fear of confusing one phantom with another, 
may lead us scientifically upon the wrong path, and 
is cowardice unworthy of the school and of its 
members. We must not consider the matter as 
indifferent. Historical teaching in schools, as every- 
where, should, like the mathematical or natural 
sciences, implant respect for facts—that is, develop 
the sense of truth—and thus quietly oppose that 
untruthfulness and that system of lies and equivoca- 
tions which is adopted for purposes of compromise 
* The History of Frederick II. of Prussia, vol. i., p. 208, in the 
German translation: “ The Reformation was the great event of 
that sixteenth century. As a man forwarded that movement, 
or was idle and hindered its effects, so he can claim to be remem- 
bered or forgotten in our age.”” The whole passage must be read, 
though from the historical standpoint we cannot entirely agree 
with its one-sided and uncompromising Protestantism. Thus 
it is clear that this event brought a new intellectual principle into 
the world, which influenced the lives of individuals and nations, 
and must therefore take a prominent place in historical teaching. 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  174 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
and convenience, and has been widely disseminated. 
The Protestant teacher will be well advised, and 
should, indeed, prefer to bring forward the great 
and pure personalities of the Catholic Church—men 
such as Contarini or Hadrian VI. ; even the Jesuit 
Order should not be caricatured, and wherever the 
teacher finds readiness to sacrifice self for an idea, 
the sacrifice should be duly emphasized ; it will be 
most advisable for him to remind his pupils that it 
was not only the Roman Church that burnt or 
tortured men of an alien creed. 
At the close of the Middle Ages our historical 
standpoint undergoes a change; modern history 
can no longer be entirely treated as German history, 
as in the case of the Middle Ages; if it does not 
become “ world history,’ yet it must be handled 
from a European standpoint. This statement is 
especially true of the history of the Reformation— 
the foundation of all later history—and in Germany 
we must not descend to the level of English or of 
French historical teaching. We now propose to 
give some indications concerning this last period of 
our progress which will deal with the distribution of 
our matter and the varying amount of detail that 
should be given. The general divisions are as 
follows : 1517-1648, 1648-1789, 1789-1871; and each 
of these three periods, as we shall see, will naturally 
fall into three sections. 
The first period—that of the religious struggles— 
is subdivided into three sections—1517-1555, 1555- 
1618, 1618-1648. The first of these—a detailed
-P-A-G-E-197
  THE HIGHER STAGES 175 
account of the German Reformation—will be 
assigned to the last three months in the Lower 
Sixth. Under favourable circumstances it is just 
possible that a teacher may be able to do more, and 
to go through the history of the non-German coun- 
tries from 1517 to 1618, though we are ready to add 
this to the work allotted to the Upper Sixth. The 
question is of minor importance ; it is only neces- 
sary that the pupil should clearly understand the 
fate of the new principle in the other European 
countries—Italy, Spain, France, England, ete. An 
account must also be given of Spanish history, in- 
cluding the revolt of the Netherlands, to 1609; of 
French history to the death of Henry IV. in 1610; 
of English and Scotch history to the accession of the 
second Stuart in 1625; and of German history until 
1618 ; the Reformation in Scandinavia can be re- 
served until the appearance of Gustavus Adolphus. 
This arrangement is advantageous because it will 
enable us to resume the history of Germany, and 
continue the study of it uninterruptedly from 1555 to 
1648 ; we should advise that the whole of German 
history from 1555 to 1618 be taken in one lesson— 
that is, in barest outline. If anyone cannot under- 
stand the reason for this procedure, he will find it in 
the first volume of Moritz Ritter. It is far more im- 
portant that the Form should gain a clear idea of the 
great European crisis in that vast historical struggle 
during the ninth decade of the sixteenth century, 
and should, for instance, correctly understand the 
events of 1588. Otherwise the pupils will be unable
-P-A-G-E-198
176 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
to appreciate the Thirty Years’ War, where more 
detailed narrative is possible, though the military 
operations should not be unduly elaborated, and 
certainly not in the last period—from 1632 to 1648. 
The history of the Thirty Years’ War is chiefly a 
history of Germany from 1618-1648, and will be 
followed by that of the other European countries. 
English history in detail to January 30, 1649; 
the execution of Charles I.; the Netherlands the 
rising Power, and Spain the decadent Power; a 
summary of Italian history ; France, taken last, but 
in fuller detail, as here, in contrast to contemporary 
developments in England, the absolutism of the 
Crown is upon the rise, and will dominate the 
following period. By beginning at this point— 
French history from the death of Henry IV. to the 
accession of Louis XIV.—we again secure the 
advantage of a connected account of French history 
from 1610-1700—a procedure advisable, as France 
is to be the dominant Power in the following period. 
The second period of modern history—1648-1789 
—falls no less easily into three periods; from the 
Peace of Westphalia to the death of Charles II. of 
Spain ; from thence to the accession of Frederick IT. 
of Prussia ; and from thence to the summoning of 
the States-General to Versailles—1648-1700, 1700- 
1740, 1740-1789. The first of these sections is 
usually known as the age of Louis XIV., and in 
describing this it is advisable or necessary to refer 
to the social or economic aspects of it which have 
previously been turned to account. These include
-P-A-G-E-199
THE HIGHER STAGES 177 
the transformation of a strong feudalism to a strict 
monarchical government, the reform of the judica- 
ture, the financial administration, the formation of a 
standing army, the furtherance of commerce and in- 
dustry, the literary glorification and the self-worship 
of the monarchy, the taming of the nobility, etc. 
Such are the true elements of the age of Louis XIV., 
and it will have been already observed, with reference 
to the Huguenot persecution, that bigotry and 
fanaticism are bad influences upon administration. 
These influences of general culture are far more 
valuable and important at this point than the details 
of military or diplomatic entanglements. French 
history will be succeeded by the English history of 
this important period—from the death of Charles I. 
to the death of William III.—in other words, to 
the consolidation of the revolution of 1689, ending 
in 1700. This period of history must also be 
worked through in some detail; it is a period of 
English history of universal importance, and displays 
men and institutions of a character so original that 
the pupils in the upper Forms of any secondary 
school should know more of it than a few scattered 
dates. We Germans understand English history 
better than that of any other nation, for the reason 
that it is inspired by a Teutonic spirit common to 
us both, and this period—1648-1700—is easily 
intelligible, whereas the following period—the reign 
of Anne and the four Georges—is not of a character 
to be narrated in detail. As regards German history 
from 1648 to 1700, I feel bound to observe that 
12
-P-A-G-E-200
    178 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
it is usually presented to schoolboys in the blackest 
colours, and the House of Hapsburg and the Holy 
Roman Empire both fare very badly. But we 
conceive that the following points should be strongly 
emphasized : in the first place, the Emperor was, 
unfortunately, obliged to oppose France and the 
Turks simultaneously, yet during the second half 
or the last quarter of the seventeenth century he 
was able definitely to shatter the Turkish power ; 
secondly, a further great political success belongs to 
this period—the creation of the State of Branden- 
burg-Prussia. In describing the reign of the great 
Elector there can be no possible objection to treating 
his domestic administration in greater detail than 
his wars, and doing full justice to the economic and 
social importance of the miles perpetuus. 
The second section of the second main period— 
from 1700 to 1740—began with the two great wars— 
the War of the Spanish Succession and the Northern 
War. Here we must inevitably devote some atten- 
tion to the military affairs—to the seats of war and 
the individual campaigns. Both wars can only be 
understood from the European standpoint, and must 
be treated as European events; their special 
German interest must be considered, but treated as 
a secondary matter. We only refer to the point in 
view of the current opinion that everything should 
be treated as German history. Both wars—and 
especially the treaties which brought them to an 
end—provide a welcome opportunity for explaining 
the territorial conditions and the balance of power
-P-A-G-E-201
THE HIGHER STAGES 179 
within a continent. The Northern War thus be- 
comes supplementary to the Spanish War; the 
Northern and Eastern world, the history of Scandi- 
navia and of Russia with Poland acquires strong 
interest, and the teacher is thus obliged to devote 
one lesson at least to an explanation of the geo- 
graphical conditions on which the Russian power 
is based ; he will then proceed to give a short outline 
of the historical development of this empire, and 
will find a further opportunity for comparing the 
social and economic developments with those of 
other countries. It is, indeed, most important that 
boys who are to receive the education of scholars 
and to occupy leading positions in the State should 
be given more detailed information concerning the 
Slavonic nationalities. As regards the teacher’s 
preparation, he will find all that he requires in 
part 2, sectioni., of Bernhardi’s Geschichte Russlands 
und der europaischen Politik 1814-1831, pp. 197-436 
(Leipsic, 1874). This work is the more to be recom- 
mended, as so excellent an outline would not naturally 
be sought in the second volume of a history of 
Russia in the nineteenth century. The so-called 
Northern War gains a certain epic character and 
interest from the highly entertaining personality of 
Charles XII. His career will be pursued until its 
close—that is, until the time when he was “‘ treacher- 
ously ’” shot down, as the story goes, which still 
finds credence in histories of reputation. Here an 
opportunity arises of the kind that should not be 
sought, but should be used when it occurs—an 
12—2
-P-A-G-E-202
180 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
opportunity of showing the mature pupil the nature 
of popular rumour and sensational stories, and the 
difference between these and serious history. Charles 
met his death by a shot from the fortress he was 
besieging, as has been indisputably proved by two 
examinations of his skeleton, and five minutes will 
be well spent in the application of historical criticism 
to tradition. The materials are to be found in 
Fryxell’s work upon the history of Charles XII., 
which has been translated into German, and whence 
the idea passed to such popular text-books as 
Jiger’s History of the World, iii. 476 f. 
When the treaties of 1713, 1714, 1719, 1720, 1721, 
and their results have been explained, the rest of 
the section—from 1721 to 1740—need occupy but one 
lesson, and can be handled in an outline sketch, 
which method I distinguish from narrative. Per- 
haps here, and not when dealing with 1648—as the 
Prussian syllabus advises—is the best opportunity 
to give a general view of the European State 
system, either just before the Peace of Vienna in 
1735 or as fixed by it. At the same time an 
opportunity remains to devote some time to special 
details—such, for instance, as the financial methods 
of John Law—when dealing with France. Here 
useful information may be given upon the economic 
meaning of money, credit, bankruptcy, and collapse. 
We assume from personal experience that this 
date—1740—can be reached, even though the half- 
year’s work is begun at 1555, and not at 1648 ; hence 
the second half-year in the Upper Sixth remains
-P-A-G-E-203
  THE HIGHER STAGES 181 
for the period from 1740 to 1871. The time will be 
adequate, as this portion of history has already been 
treated in some detail in the Lower Fifth—a fact 
which considerably facilitates instruction in the 
highest Form, though the method may be essentially 
different. The period from 1740 to 1789—the third 
section of the second main period of modern history 
—the age of Frederick the Great—should be intro- 
duced by devoting three or four lessons to a general 
view of Brandenburg-Prussian history, and to a 
revision of earlier events. This is to be a review, 
and not a detailed revision, and we repeat that our 
review should be handled from a German or Euro- 
pean standpoint with equal detail or brevity, 
whether the school belong to Bavaria, Wurtemberg, 
or Prussia. As regards the details of Frederick 
the Great’s history we need say but little; false- 
hood and flattery should be avoided; the truth, 
for instance, should not be concealed that the 
education of the great man was highly deficient and 
partially misguided ; the fact should also be re- 
eretted that Frederick William I. has been usually 
described as a half-mad tyrant; but this should 
not lead us to pass the opposite boundary of his- 
torical truth in dealing with so curious a mixture of 
contradictions. The military history should be 
kept in strict chronological order by summers and 
winters upon the method of Thucydides and his 
imitator Archenholz, and the various seats of war 
should be carefully distinguished. In narrating battles 
there should be no display of amateur strategy or
-P-A-G-E-204
182 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
learned expositions upon right and left wings; in 
every important battle some pregnant feature 
should be emphasized, and for this purpose, as we 
have said, Carlyle’s biography of Frederick the 
Great is eminently suitable, though historical 
philistinism is not likely to agree with his methods of 
writing history. The history of Frederick should 
be related consecutively up to the Peace of Huberts- 
burg; the difficult section—from 1763 to 1789— 
should be more briefly treated, but not too scantily. 
Our arrangement would be as follows: 
1. Germany. . 
(a) Prussian section—half of the reign of 
Frederick. 
(0) Austria—Maria Theresia; Joseph II.’s 
reforms in the hereditary States. 
(c) Transition from this point to his attempts 
at reform within the empire. This 
will provide an opportunity of de- 
scribing the condition of the empire (cf. 
Lower Fifth, above), the political dis- 
ruption of Germany and its intellectual 
revival. 
2. Russia, Turkey, Poland (first partition). 
3. The North, Denmark (Struensee), Sweden 
(coup @ état of 1772). 
4. Similar despotic reforms upon the other side— 
Portugal, Naples, Spain, the rise of the Jesuit 
Order, and the general character of the period as an 
age of enlightenment. 
5. In conclusion, England and France—their
-P-A-G-E-205
  
  THE HIGHER STAGES | 183 
respective domestic developments, their maritime 
rivalry ; the struggles in East India and North 
America—the former briefly, the latter in greater 
detail, as being the early history of the United 
States. Hence, in transition, to the history of 
France under Louis XVI., as preliminary to the 
French Revolution. 
Thus we have reached the third period—1789- 
1871—about the end of October, and if all goes well, 
we have yet four months at our disposal. As we 
approach modern times, the teacher’s task becomes 
more difficult, chiefly in consequence of the oppres- 
sive amount of information with which we can only 
grapple by preferential choice and by somewhat 
unequal treatment. We offer a few remarks upon 
this subject. The sections are 1789-1815, 1815- 
1848, 1848-1871. 
In dealing with the history of the Revolution 
period proper—from 1789 to 1804—it will be advis- 
able not to go too deeply into the causes of the Revo- 
lution, which are extremely complicated, but to 
relate its progress with all the completeness possible 
until the events of Thermidor. Military events will 
be recounted in close connexion with the text-book, 
which it is to be hoped may be an intelligible one— 
without too much detail. We shall devote more 
time to the overthrow of the Directory and to the 
reaction of the Revolution monarchy in France upon 
German affairs. For the period from 1804 to 1812 
military events and the magic personality of 
Napoleon become prominent; at the same time a
-P-A-G-E-206
  184 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
word should be devoted to the beneficial effects, 
mediate and immediate, of thistyranny. In passing, 
we may observe that a thorough acquaintance with ~ 
this period—1789-1815—will enable our Sixth-Form 
boys far more easily to understand contemporary 
history than a bare and superficial outline of the 
period from 1871 to 1900, though something of the 
kind must be given. 
Here, as throughout modern and contemporary 
history, the teacher must be careful to avoid ex- 
cessive detail about strategy and tactics; the pro- 
gress of wars will be made clear by accentuating the 
turning-points at the different seats of war, and 
the pupil must be accustomed to read his atlas from - 
the historical point of view; the atlas need not 
necessarily be a so-called historical one. Adequate 
time must be reserved for the history from 1813 to 
1814— especially the former year—and in the latter 
case military details must be given with some com- 
pletion ; the school library should be able to pro- 
vide some help at this point, and instruction may 
well be supplemented by home reading.* 
The second section—1815-1848—can be briefly 
treated, rather in outline than in narrative, with 
closer reference to the text-book than in dealing with 
* IT can recommend Die Befreiungskreig, 1813-1815. Aus

(Berlin, H. Paetel, 1903); also Der deutsch-franzdsische Krieg,

editorship.
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE HIGHER STAGES 185 
the previous period. We shall begin with an 
accurate picture of the territorial conditions in 
Europe produced by the Vienna treaties, and 
explain the essential characteristics of the five Great 
Powers; brief reference will be made to the other 
States, after which we shall go through the most 
important events in chronological order, as they 
occurred in the several countries. Well-informed 
teachers may here refer to the Customs Union, as 
the seed of German unity, and explain the services 
of Frederick William III. and of his advisers. 
Fortunately, we have now abandoned the stand- 
point of Rotteck or Hagen. The year 1830 is a 
holting-place which has lost its importance for 
teaching purposes by reason of further develop- 
sents, and it will be enough if we briefly outline 
the general result of the “ great week.” 
the opening of the third section—1848-1871—is 
morked by the great crisis of the century between 
1848 and 1852; this is a subject extraordinarily | 
. dificult of treatment, by reason of the interaction 
of widely remote events, which seem to defy all 
_ efforts to provide a general view. I can but refer 
the teacher who reads these observations to my own 
attempt at the solution of this problem in the 
briss der N euesten Geschichte (Wiesbaden: successors 
of ©. G. Kunze, 2nd edition, 1889, with appendix to 
'©00)—an attempt upon which is based the section 
relerring to this subject in the later editions of 
-lerost’s popular text-book. My efforts have been 
oated—if, as Lessing says, I may boast of my
-P-A-G-E-208
    186 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
industry—upon an exhaustive study of the facts. 
and upon long efforts to co-ordinate them—which 
is more than I can say for the counter proposals 
which certain critics have made. 
The period from 1852 to 1863 offers fewer diffi- 
culties ; the most important events can be taken in 
connexion with the territorial changes in the East and 
in Italy, and an outline given of the two wars which 
produced this change in the map; the tyranny of 
Nicholas I. of Russia and of Napoleon ITI. will then 
be more clearly and effectively explained. Finally, 
we shall reach Germany, where, after reference to 
its material progress, we shall emphasize the un- 
satisfactory and dangerous nature of the political 
situation about 1863, with reference to the Federal 
Constitution, to Austria and to Prussia. The critical 
year is 1863, and to this full weight must be 
given, including the crisis of the domestic quarrel 
in Prussia, the meeting of the German Princes, the ' 
war of succession in Schleswig-Holstein, and the 
general German question which now enters the 
stage of decision. Thereupon will follow the new 
birth and remoulding of Germany between 1863 
and 1871; adequate time must be reserved for this 
narrative, which is by no means difficult, as the 
course of events is very clear, and as the war 
of 1866 can now be impartially considered, for 
we have long surmounted the chief crisis. The 
narrative should accentuate the following points : 
1. That the life of a great nation such as ours is 
a matter of vast importance. 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE HIGHER STAGES 187 
2. That the union of a great nation to form one 
State has never been secured by the peaceful co- 
operation of its component parts—tante molis erat 
Romanam condere gentem. 
3. That the military struggle between Austria 
and Prussia, between the old Germany of the federal 
days and the new Germany—a civil or fratricidal 
war—implied the removal of the stagnation which 
would have been death to the nation. 
4. That it was an act of Divine providence that 
the lessons of history and the recognition of the 
pitiable conditions from 1815 to 1863 were forced 
upon the old Germany by the new Prussian State 
and its slowly growing strength, and not by a 
triumphant France. 
As regards the reconciling war with France in 
1870 and its great result, which is the conclusion of 
historical instruction proper, we need say nothing. 
The coldest teacher will here be inspired, and the 
historian can here find the highest profit and the 
deepest satisfaction from his preparatory studies ; 
he can leave the eloquence of facts to plead their 
own cause. 
As regards the lecture to the Form and the presen- 
tation of the subject-matter, we have a few words 
to say concerning revision in this highest stage. It 
is a difficult task for the teacher in either of its two 
respects—the revision of the previous lesson or the 
revision of the whole sections which have been 
worked through. 
Great importance is now attached to a connected
-P-A-G-E-210
  188 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
reproduction of the previous lesson by the pupil in 
his own words. Of this we have already spoken. 
To the previous quotation of the Prussian syllabus 
of 1901 regarding the reproduction of what has been 
learnt, I should wish to add the words, “So far as 
this reproduction can subserve a grasp of historical 
connexion and its impression upon the pupils’ 
minds.” We repeat the fact that this exercise must 
further the purpose of historical teaching, and is 
not merely to be a linguistic training, for it is not 
the business of the history master to teach pupils 
the use of their own language. All that can be re- 
quired is that pupils should learn to express them- 
selves intelligently and with some fluency upon the 
historical matter that has been already worked 
through. The idea that “historical lectures ”’ 
should be prepared and delivered by the pupils is 
one of the many ideas which would be excellent if 
we had more time at our disposal. This, however, 
is the business of the University and its historical 
seminary. Again, in the case of revision “in in- 
formal language,’ when successive pupils are called 
upon to give a connected account of the previous 
lesson, we must be careful to avoid rigidity of 
practice ; and the more difficult questions will be 
better revised by way of question and answer if full 
comprehension is to be secured. Constitutional and 
economic history must certainly be thus treated. And 
the teacher will soon discover that even in the highest 
Form but few pupils possess the capacity clearly to 
grasp and to repeat an historical sequence of events. 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE HIGHER STAGES 189 
The lecture to the Form and the revision from 
hour to hour obliges the pupil to work through his 
text-book and to learn its contents, and is primarily 
intended to secure a connected understanding of 
the course of events. Similarly, the revision of 
longer sections, as we have previously urged, is 
intended to enable the pupil to use the material 
he has acquired, and to introduce him to the task 
of applying historical knowledge. This process was 
begun in the Third Form and continued throughout 
the successive Forms; it is obvious that the practice 
can‘be made far more beneficial in a Sixth Form. 
Once again we must emphasize the fact that in our 
experience these revisions are one of the most 
difficult tasks which can confront the teacher, or 
which he can place before himself. The lines upon 
which they can be conducted are naturally infinite ; 
some of these we propose to set down in the 
appendix, hoping that in this way we shall better 
deal with this important subject than by developing 
a theory of these general revisions. In this practice 
—and especially with the Sixth Form—we must be 
careful to avoid undue profundity. But to return 
to what we said at the outset, the whole of our in- 
struction, even in this highest stage, is merely of 
a preparatory character ; we are still a long distance 
from what was formerly known as the philosophy 
of history or the biology of mankind—to use the 
phrase of Thomas Buckle in his History of Civiliza- 
tion in England (1865)—a book once famous, and 
now unduly neglected. It is at the same time
-P-A-G-E-212
  190 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
essential to the preparatory nature of our instruc- 
tion that the pupil’s gaze should be directed upon 
such higher objects as are visible at a distance. 
He must understand that every piece of knowledge 
is intended to lead to further knowledge, and that 
every stage of acquisition is but preliminary to 
further acquisition; he must realize the further 
implication that every advance to a higher stage of 
knowledge implies higher claims upon the moral 
powers of mankind. 
In our instruction we reject all preaching, all 
so-called stimulus of patriotism and of other virtues 
of the kind ; at every step we demand that our in- 
struction should be, above all things, true, and should 
avoid both the exaggerations of the flatterer and 
the optimist, and the pessimism of would-be im- 
partiality. At the same time we do not wish to 
imply that secondary-school instruction in history 
should not in every case deal with the subject from 
the standpoint of freedom and responsibility ; we 
insist that what is morally hateful or despicable 
should be characterized as such. Tout savoir est 
tout pardonner is a favourite saying in our effemi- 
nate times; we, however, would point out to 
our historical teachers by way of conclusion that 
their work can only be fruitful when their pupils 
learn the habit of strict judgment upon ethical 
matters, and that we would rather see a teacher 
overstep the golden mean in the manner of old 
Schlosser than in that of Ranke. We refer here 
to the general spirit in which history should be  
-P-A-G-E-213
THE HIGHER STAGES 191 
taught. Occasions will always present themselves 
for a call upon the moral judgment of the pupils 
— such occasions as the secession of Henry IV., 
the trial of Mary Stuart, the execution of Michael 
Servetus, or of the Duc d’Enghien. 
Here we might obviously touch upon many 
incidental points—the possibility of a general re- 
vision of any one period from special points of view, 
the question as to how far home reading can, or 
should, support Form instruction; we might give 
literary information for the teacher’s preparation of 
special periods ; we might express our wishes with 
reference to the training of the embryo history 
teacher at the University ; we must not, however, 
be led astray by questions, the discussion of which 
would be of no immediate advantage to our 
readers. 
We have been unable to give information upon 
any special art or method which can facilitate the 
burden of historical instruction and make it easier 
than it naturally is. A principal subject of in- 
struction it is not ; but a subordinate subject when 
badly taught can easily become a primary source of 
evil, like any other. On the other hand, any sub- 
ordinate subject when well handled, and, therefore, 
good historical teaching, can compensate and repair 
many deficiencies and failures apparent in the 
other subjects of school instruction. Should the 
teacher who is true to himself, find to his grief 
that his instruction is far removed from his own
-P-A-G-E-214
  192 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
ideal, he may, none the less, comfort himself by 
the contemplation of what is achieved within the 
school by the co-operation of the various forces 
there operative ; this result, even in our own sub- 
ject, is by no means small. Even if we assume, as we 
should do, téachers, text-books, and scholars of only 
average merit, yet the achievement of these scholars 
is by no means light. One advantage they have had, 
and one which gives the pupil of the classical school 
an advantage over the pupil of the modern school, 
though in other respects they run upon parallel 
lines ; he has had nine years’ close training in two 
important civilized languages, and has been reading 
graduated authors of first-hand historical im- 
portance ; he has learnt to perceive, and to a certain 
extent to feel, by experience the connexion of modern 
life and thought with the civilization of the remote 
past ; he has followed German literature from the 
fable and the fairy-tale to the pitch of high tragedy, 
and has thus gained a glimpse of our national 
growth ; he has learnt one or two modern languages 
so far as to understand the identity and the dis- 
similarity of German, french, and English 
nationalism, and has thereby learnt both national 
pride and national modesty ; twice has he travelled 
through the centuries, the nations, and the ages, 
has seen and known many men and towns, like 
Odysseus, and has secured a knowledge of the most 
important facts which will serve as landmarks in 
any prosecution of his studies. With the guidance 
and support of religion and religious instruction he
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE HIGHER STAGES 193 
has come to understand the idea of humanity, 
which from an empty phrase has become a truth and 
an accomplished fact ; these forces and influences 
have finally implanted a sense of duty and a con- 
sciousness, or the germs thereof, compelling him 
to admit that his life is inevitably devoted to a 
fatherland and a nation which existed before any 
one of its members, and will exist long after they 
have gone—in a word, he will understand his 
position as a member of the human race.

LECTURE TO A THIRD Form. 
(THE Battle of Cannz has been narrated in the pre- 
ceding lesson, and the characteristic points repeated. 
The master continues.) 
A Roman statesman who took part in this war, 
and was probably present at the disaster of Cannee— 
M. Porcius Cato—tells us that in his time there was a 
general belief that on the day following his tre- 
mendous victory Hannibal was urged by one of his 
generals to march at once upon Rome, as he would 
certainly find the city in panic, and its capture 
would be easy. “In five days,” Maharbal, the 
cavalry leader, is said to have asserted, “ you will 
be dining in the Capitol.’? Hannibal is said to have 
answered that he would consider the proposal, and 
some days later, after securing the plunder and the 
prisoners, and burying the dead, he returned to the 
subject of his own accord, but the cavalry general 
replied “‘ that it was now too late, as the news had 
already reached Rome.”’ 
Hannibal, no doubt, had his own reasons, of which 
we shall speak later, for rejecting this advice. He 
would no more have been able to take Rome by a 
194
-P-A-G-E-217
    APPENDIX 195 
sudden surprise than the Germans could have sur- 
prised Paris in 1870, after the Battle of Sedan ; so 
much is obvious from information given by the 
classical historians concerning the attitude of the 
Roman government when the news of the defeat 
arrived. 
At the same time, the first impression was so great 
that every one seemed paralyzed. We have already 
heard that some of the fugitives from the battle 
were able to make a short stay in Canusium, where a 
patriotic woman—Busa by name—gave them the 
first refreshment they received ; among these despair 
was so great that some of the younger officers began 
to consider whether it would not be better to take 
flight across the sea to some king, as the cause of 
Rome was lost. We are very glad to read that a 
young man of the Roman nobility—P. Cornelius 
Scipio—displayed a true. Roman and patriotic spirit ; 
the more grievous the calamity, the more ready we 
should be to support our country. He is said to 
have confronted these misguided men with drawn 
sword, and to have forced them to swear an oath, 
which he himself was the first to take, never to 
abandon the Republic or allow anyone else to do so. 
Very similar was the state of affairs in Rome when the 
news of the disaster reached that city. No classical 
author has described the first impression, but it 
can easily be imagined ; all was lost, both Consuls 
had fallen, the army was annihilated, and the excite- 
ment and panic were increased by the terrible details 
which came in by degrees. Almost every house 
13—2
-P-A-G-E-218
196 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
had some loss to bewail, and even more grievous was 
the uncertainty for the fate of their relatives in the 
majority of cases ; hence the population, and the 
women in particular, abandoned themselves to 
sorrow and to fear. There was, however, in Rome 
a body capable of governing and of guiding the 
ship of State throughout the most violent storm ; 
this was the Senate, and the two pretors, who had 
remained in Rome, had no hesitation in immediately 
summoning the Senate to the Curia Hostilia. 
We know how the Senate was composed ; it was 
invariably recruited from men who had held the 
questorship—a high and responsible office—and 
who then became life members of the Senate, pro- 
vided they had passed the censorship satisfactorily. 
The Senate was therefore an assembly of men who 
had been elected by the confidence of the people, 
and who yet stood apart from popular passions, 
an assembly of officials and heads of ancient families, 
who were accustomed to deliberate calmly and with 
experience ; where leadership, organization, and 
action were required, as in the present instance, 
they were fully equal to the task. The necessary 
arrangements were speedily made; public order 
was restored, public lamentations were forbidden ; 
scouts were sent out to gather news and to see 
that all news was first given to the pretors, lest 
undue excitement should be aroused: the gates 
were guarded by detachments of soldiers. and no 
one was allowed to leave the city. A letter arrived 
from the Consul Terentius, which revealed the whole 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  APPENDIX 197 
extent of the misfortune, and disastrous news also 
arrived from other quarters, from Cisalpine Gaul 
and from Sicily; but the determination of the 
Government had already taken the measures most 
necessary for the defence of the city, and for this 
purpose a dictator was appointed, according to 
ancient custom. Religious duties were not for- 
gotten ; serious consideration was given to the best 
means of averting the anger of the gods, which 
was displayed in these repeated calamities, and it 
is said that messengers were sent even to Delphi, 
the ancient oracle, to secure this information. 
Some sacrifices must also be made to the wild super- 
stition of the excited multitude, and, in accordance 
with the oracle, a Gaulish man and woman and a 
Greek man and woman were buried alive in the 
forum. More important was the fact that the dis- 
sension among the ruling classes, which had largely 
contributed to the previous defeats, was now at an 
end. There had been strife between a senatorial 
party and a popular party, an opposition apparent 
throughout Roman history ; Terentius Varro, who 
was responsible for the disaster, belonged, as we 
shall remember, to the popular party. Against the 
advice of the other Consul, A‘milius Paulus, and 
against the counsel of the old Fabius, he had plunged 
recklessly into battle, and his action had ended in 
this appalling catastrophe. We might expect that 
general indignation and popular excitement would 
have been visited upon him personally. But the 
Senate was wiser. At this moment there could be no
-P-A-G-E-220
198 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
parties in the State, and when the surviving Consul, 
Varro, reached the neighbourhood of the Capitol 
with such remnants of the army as he could collect, 
the Senate came out to meet him and to thank him 
because he had not despaired of the Republic. He 
was, however, removed from command, though no 
stigma was inflicted. 
Rome, which was in any case a strong fortress, 
was thus entirely secured against any surprise a few 
days after the defeat. Hannibal knew his adver- 
saries too well, and was too conscious of their real 
powers to contemplate any attempt of the kind. 
Like all great men, he was not waging war for its 
own sake, and would have been very ready to 
conclude a moderate peace with Rome, which 
would have checked the crushing superiority of the 
Romans, and have restored to his own city the losses 
of the previous generation. At this moment he 
summoned the Roman citizens from among the 
prisoners, and addressed them in moderate terms, 
explaining that he was not waging war to the knife, 
offering the possibility of ransom, and permitting 
them to choose ten delegates to discuss the matter 
in Rome. They were accompanied by a distin- 
guished Carthaginian, a confidant of Hannibal—by 
name Carthalo—who was commissioned to explain 
the conditions upon which Hannibal was prepared 
to conclude peace. 
Carthalo himself was not admitted within the 
city ; the delegates, however, were allowed to enter 
and to plead their cause before the Senate. The
-P-A-G-E-221
  APPENDIX 199 
historian Livy places a moving speech, which you 
will afterwards read for yourselves, in the mouth of 
their spokesman, and every effort was made to 
move the fathers to pity ; a numerous company had 
assembled before the Curia demanding with loud 
complaints and cries that the Senate should permit 
the ransom of their sons, their fathers, or their 
brothers from the hardships of captivity. For a 
moment, indeed, the Senate hesitated, as it had 
done two generations earlier; who can tell me 
upon what occasion? But here, again, a man was 
found, like Appius Claudius on the former occa- 
sion, to explain to the Senate what the Roman people 
owed to itself, and to assert that there could be no 
question of peace or submission so long as the enemy 
remained upon Italian soil ; this man was T. Manlius 
Torquatus, a descendant of that Manlius Torquatus 
who had formerly sacrificed his own son to the 
severity of Roman military discipline at a crisis 
of the Latin war. He led the opposition, and the 
Roman Senate passed a resolution which, terribly 
severe as it was, was in consonance with the desperate 
situation of their Republic. Ransom was forbidden 
and peace proposals rejected; the delegates re- 
turned, and the Roman people without a murmur 
submitted to the heroic resolution of its government. 
Such is the behaviour of a brave nation and a strong 
government in time of difficulty, and Livy says that 
this war was more memorable than any that had 
preceded it, because it was the struggle of a great 
leader and general with a great nation.

200 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Fourts Form. 
(In order to explain our idea of the master’s 
narrative lecture, we have chosen the somewhat 
difficult subject of the conflict between King and 
Pope, between Henry IV. and Gregory VII.) 
In October, 1075, the dangerous revolt in Saxony 
had been completely crushed, and Pope Gregory had 
also congratulated the King upon this victory. 
Differences of opinion on subjects of negotiation 
divided them, but as yet there had been no open 
breach. Now, however, that the Pope had overcome 
initial difficulties, he proceeded with that ruthless 
boldness characteristic of him to prosecute the strict 
ecclesiastical ideas which are generally known as 
Cluniac, from the monastery in Aquitaine in which 
Gregory himself had lived for some time. He 
strove first of all to suppress the marriage of the 
priests and the practice known as simony, from the 
name of Simon, as mentioned in the New Testa- 
ment story ; this Simon had offered money to the 
Apostles Peter and John in Samaria, that he might 
also receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying 
on of hands. In the eyes of Gregory and the strict 
ecclesiastical party, the priests who received ecclesi- 
astical office from a layman, or a layman who offered 
such office, were alike guilty of simony, which was 
condemned as a deadly sin. 
Such practices were then very common on the part 
both of clergy and laity ; however, in February of
-P-A-G-E-223
APPENDIX 201 
that year Gregory threatened certain of the King’s 
councillors with excommunication on the ground 
that they had been guilty of simony. He was fully 
inspired by the idea that in every case the ecclesi- 
astical should be dominant over the secular power, 
and that the priesthood should rule all princes and 
kingdoms ; it was only natural that he should come 
into violent conflict with existing authorities and 
make many. enemies. Among the superior and 
inferior German clergy he had many opponents, 
who were alarmed by his ruthless procedure ; in 
Lombardy there was a strong opposition party, and 
it was known that a similar party existed in Rome 
itself, which even attacked and _ ill-treated him 
during the Christmas of 1075. Henry, who was now 
twenty-five years of age, therefore considered that he 
might easily maintain the old royal rights against the 
Pope, and did not take his threat seriously. 
Gregory, however, was well aware of the difficulties 
of the King’s position, nor was he a man to utter 
empty threats. In full seriousness he was advancing 
this claim, which we now regard as presumptuous 
and unchristian, and as incompatible with the 
Divine command that we should render unto Cesar 
the things that are Cesar’s, and to God the things 
that are God’s. The councillors were excommuni- 
cated, and Papal legates came to the royal court 
demanding that the King should separate himself 
from the excommunicated and should change his 
attitude, which vexed the Church ; in case of resist- 
ance, he was himself to be excommunicated. The
-P-A-G-E-224
202 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
King was angry, as was but natural ; he immediately 
summoned the Bishops and the chief clergy of his 
Empire to a Synod at Worms, where the deposition 
of Gregory was discussed. In a synod at Piacenza 
the Lombard Bishops supported this resolution, and 
Henry’s ambassadors appeared at Rome in February, 
1076, to communicate the deposition to a Lateran 
Council and to secure its execution. The Council, 
however, was entirely on Gregory’s side, and the 
Pope was thus able to deliver a counterstroke, 
which re-echoed throughout the world. With great 
solemnity, he pronounced sentence of excommuni- 
cation upon the first Prince in Christendom, con- 
cluding with the text upon which the Roman 
Church founds its claim to supremacy: “‘ Thou art 
Peter, and upon this rock I will found my church, 
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it ”’ 
(Matt. xvi. 18). 
Gregory was able to take this bold step because 
the consistency with which he championed the 
sternest and strictest ideas widely impressed the 
people and corresponded with the opinions prevalent 
at that time ; he was also helped by the fact that 
Henry was opposed by most of the German Princes, 
who suspected him of planning a boundless extension 
of his royal power, and feared him because he was 
a man of unusual capacity. They came to a 
mutual agreement, and Otto of Nordheim, the most 
important of the German nobles, again came forward 
in opposition to the King, whose high confidence he 
had enjoyed for a time. They entered into alliance
-P-A-G-E-225
  APPENDIX 203 
with Pope Gregory, who was to aid them in their 
object of deposing the King—an object which could 
not immediately and directly be attained. They 
met at Tribur, in the modern Grand Duchy of Hesse, 
and as the King was both too weak and too politic 
to use force, a kind of compromise was arranged ; 
this, however, was not seriously meant, and the 
hostile views and opinions of the princes were but 
thinly veiled. They granted the King a short period 
—to February 22 of the following year—to secure 
his release from the sentence of excommunication ; 
until that date he was to abstain from the business 
of government, and not even to wear the royal 
insignia. In February there was to be an assembly 
of the Princes at Augsburg, at which the Pope would 
be present, and a decision would then be taken; 
this was a shameful resolution, and would have de- 
stroyed both the secular power and their own. 
Moreover, the resolution was neither honourable nor 
honestly intended. They believed, and with reason, 
that they might suppose the King would be unable to 
secure his release from the sentence of excommunica- 
tion by the Pope. The Pope, in fact, soon prepared 
for his journey to Germany, where Augsburg was 
his goal, and at this meeting he expected to become 
the judge of all the powers on the earth; he had 
harshly rejected Henry’s desire to come himself to 
Rome for absolution. At that moment he suddenly 
learnt that Henry was on the road to Italy. 
This had, as a matter of fact, been the King’s 
determination, but his measures were taken for
-P-A-G-E-226
  204 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
other purposes than those which Gregory assumed. 
The Pope supposed that Henry intended to secure 
absolution by force. But the King, at the age of 
twenty-seven, was too politic to adopt these 
methods ; he saw that the union of his two enemies, 
the Princes and the Pope, would certainly crush him, 
and he also saw that both were anxious to make his 
absolution impossible ; if, therefore, he did not per- 
form the conditions of absolution, he would be 
playing into their hands. This excuse must not be 
given them. With wise and rapid decision, he 
resolved to secure his absolution from the Pope, 
not by force of arms, but by moral suasion and by 
a striking act of penance, which would satisfy the 
Church’s claims. He left Spires, where he had last 
been staying, and, accompanied by a few followers 
and by his wife, whom he had misunderstood and 
unworthily treated, he crossed Mont Cenis in the 
depth of winter. The winter is described as un- 
usually cold, and the Rhine was frozen for a long 
time, until the month of March, 1077. The journey 
was extremely laborious, for at that time there were 
no railways through the Alps and no high roads. 
When he reached Italy, he did not listen to the 
offers of the Lombard malcontents, who hated 
Gregory most bitterly, but hastened onward to the 
Pope. The latter was entirely under the impression 
that the German King was coming with hostile inten- 
tions, and had therefore betaken himself to the castle 
of the most faithful servant of St. Peter—that is to 
say, of the Church—and its supreme head; this was
-P-A-G-E-227
  APPENDIX 205 
Mathilda, Countess of Tuscany, and the castle was 
Canossa. Before this lonely Tuscan castle King 
Henry appeared with a few followers in a hair shirt 
and barefoot, the usual apparel of the penitent. 
Admission was refused both on that day and on the 
second day, when he reappeared and spent the whole 
day within the inner and outer circuit walls. 
Within the castle very important discussions were 
proceeding, and decision was necessary. The situa- 
tion was as clear to the Pope as it was difficult. If 
he released the King from excommunication, he 
would break his agreement with his present allies, 
the German Princes ; Henry would be able to re- 
appear as King, and the Augsburg Assembly would 
have neither object nor purpose. If he refused 
absolution, he was contradicting his own priestly 
character; he was, indeed, committing blasphemy 
if he refused to absolve a sinner who was ready to 
perform full penance—a King and a young man 
who had given full proof of his penitence by his 
journey across the Alps in winter to satisfy the 
claims of the Church. It was impossible for him to 
refuse, and this seems to have been explained to 
him by Countess Mathilda and by Hugo, the Abbot 
of the Monastery of Clugny, who was with him. 
On the third day the gate of the inner wall was 
opened, and absolution was pronounced by the Pope 
without further difficulty, as far as we know. The 
Pope, indeed, imposed numerous severe conditions 
upon the King, but these did not alter the great 
and decisive fact of absolution‘; Henry had been
-P-A-G-E-228
  ao ents 
206 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
| received again as a member of the Church, and was 
therefore justified in reappearing as King. 
It is constantly urged that King Henry’s appear- 
ance at Canossa was a great disgrace and a deep 
humiliation to the German monarchy. This, how- 
ever, is not the correct view. Henry did penance 
in the usual form, as another great Emperor had 
done—Theodosius, in Milan—at the command of 
Bishop Ambrosius. He did what every Christian 
conscious of guilt was accustomed and bound to 
do; here there was nothing to diminish his royal 
honour and nothing that was unworthy of him. 
He was doing penance before the supreme head of _ 
the Church—the King before the first Bishop—and 
he was humbling himself before the Church and before 
God and His priest, not before Gregory. It was rather 
Gregory who was the defeated party ; he had been 
forced to do what he did not wish, and what he had 
expressly or implicitly promised the German Princes 
that he would not do. It must rather be accounted 
a merit to King Henry that by extorting this abso- 
lutism he overthrew the shameful plans of the hostile 
princes, whose hatred had invited and empowered 
the Pope to make himself supreme over the German 
crown. This supremacy would have been a heavy 
blow to the Empire as to the Church, to the secular 
as to the ecclesiastical power, and the wound in- 
flicted would never have been healed. 
Henry’s position immediately improved; the 
Pope’s alliance with the German Princes grew weak 
and became ineffective, and a contemporary his- 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
APPENDIX 207 
torian informs us that the Princes were thunder- 
struck by the news that the sentence of excommuni- 
cation had been removed. 
When this narrative has been concluded, Henry’s 
further history must be briefly explained ; we shall 
observe the course of events, the master will say, 
under the following main points : 
1. The Princes hostile to Henry, acting hence- 
forward without the co-operation of the Pope, 
elected, in March, 1077, at Forcheim, an opposition 
King, Duke Rudolf of Suabia. The result was 
war; it was not until 1080 that Pope Gregory 
plainly declared for Rudolf, but the latter fell in 
battle at Hohenmodlsen (Elster) in this same year. 
2. The second opposition King, Hermann of Lux- | 
emburg, was of no great importance. Henry, who 
had been in Italy from 1081, was able to set up an 
opposition Pope, Clement III., who crowned him 
in 1084 in the Lateran as Roman Imperator. 
3. Gregory, in the castle of St. Angelo, summons 
the Normans, who liberate him, plunder Rome, and 
carry him away; he dies in 1085 at Salerno in 
their territory. The civil or party war continued 
both in Germany and Italy. 
4. Henry returned in 1084, and in 1093 was 
obliged to subdue a revolt led by his son Conrad. 
5. He then enjoyed a few years of comparative 
peace, while the crusading movement began, and 
stimulated the idea of peace among all Christians. 
6. In 1103 a new conspiracy on the part of the 
Princes and the treachery of his son, who got the
-P-A-G-E-230
208 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Emperor into his power by cunning, and ill-treated 
him, obliged the King to abdicate. 
7. The war is renewed; the Emperor again 
appears on the field, but dies in 1106. 
(The master may choose, as he will, any one point 
for more detailed treatment. Our only object is to 
give an example of the two kinds of narrative— 
that continuous, and that in outline.) 
Upprr-FourtH Form. 
In the case of this Form we propose to give only 
one or two lines of thought, which may serve to 
connect a long revision lasting over one or two 
lessons ; the subject will be given out to the Form 
beforehand, in order that the pupils may read the 
necessary sections of the text-book from this point of 
view, and thus take the first step in that science 
which we may call applied history. The master 
will have worked through the medieval history with 
this Form in the Lower Third ; should he feel the 
need of some revision of that period, he may begin it 
when he has passed the threshold of modern history, 
that is, the deed of the Augustinian monk, Luther, 
in 1517; the revision should not be too detailed, 
and may appear as an examination of one of the 
most characteristic phenomena of the Middle Ages; 
the monastic system; the origins of the system; 
monasticism in the West; the Benedictines, 729; the 
Cluniacs of Clugny in 910; the Cistercians and Pre- 
monstratensiens ; orders of knights, and mendicant
-P-A-G-E-231
APPENDIX 209 
orders. A master of only moderate skill can here ask 
questions concerning the general characteristics or 
the most important personalities about 1096, 1190, 
1216, and 1226. This revision, however, must be 
_ done in free form, without manuscript or notes, and 
he must therefore have in his head an outline 
which will guide him from point to point, as other- 
wise he will easily go astray amid the complications 
of the matter. 
Assuming that the period from 1517 to 1555 has 
been worked through from lesson to lesson by 
lecture and revision, the knowledge acquired will 
be examined, extended, and consolidated by a 
general revision from the standpoint of the history 
of one or two territories—Saxony, for instance, or | 
.Brandenburg—and of two reigning families—the 
Wettiner and the Hohenzollerns. What districts 
does the name embrace ? What was the attitude 
of the dynasty to the Reformation movement ? 
That of the individual rulers? This method will 
produce many useful questions quite naturally. 
The period from 1555 to 1618 should be treated 
in the same way: ducal and electoral Saxony; the 
Universities of Jena and Wittenberg and their im- 
portance ; the adoption of Calvinistic Protestantism 
in 1613 by Johann Sigismund of Brandenburg. An 
attempt must be made to show the connexion of 
German with general European history for this 
period, as regards its most important dates. This 
may be done in the following way : 
Hirst give the most important dates—1556 (1558), 
14
-P-A-G-E-232
  210 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
1571, 1572, 1579 ; or 1581, 1588, 1589, 1603, 1608, 
1609, 1610, 1618 ; the respective events will then be 
assigned to each date by the pupils: the accession 
of Philip Il. in Spain ; the accession of Elizabeth, 
and the triumph of the Reformation in England ; 
the battle of Lepanto ; the massacre of St. Bartholo- 
mew at Paris ; the creation of the new State of the 
united Netherlands; the defeat of the Armada ; the 
accession of Henry IV. in France ; the House of Stuart 
in England ; the Evangelical union; the quarrel for 
the succession of Cleves and Juliers, and the death 
of Henry IV. of France; events in Prague, and the 
beginning of the Thirty Years’ War. The master 
will then go through the events in the same order, 
the boys one after another giving the dates. 
The section dealing with the Thirty Years’ War, 
from 1618 to 1648, can easily be revised in one 
lesson, and an exact impression given of the terri- 
torial conditions of our continent as constituted by 
the peace. To make the progress of the war clear 
to pupils and easy to retain in their memories, a 
few dates and names will be sufficient, such as 1618 
and 1620; the battle at the White Mountain; the 
edict of restitution in 1629; the dismissal of Wallen- 
stein and the landing of Gustavus Adolphus in 1630 ; 
Battle of Liitzen in 1632; the Peace of Prague in 
1635; the Diet of Regensburg in 1640, and the 
Peace in 1648. It will also be advisable to have the 
successive battle-fields named. 
Of the three sections of the second main period 
of modern history, the Upper Fourth is concerned
-P-A-G-E-233
  APPENDIX 211 
only with the two first—1648-1700 and 1700-1740 ; 
for the general revision of the first the following lines 
of thought will be useful. (Naturally there are 
many others available.) 
1. The most important treaties of peace: (1648), 
1659, 1668, 1679, 1697 (1699) ; here there is a point 
which experienced teachers will not despise—the 
sequence of numbers—which facilitates the memor- 
izing of these dates : 48, 68, 59, 79, 97. The figures 
can also be inspired with some life, an equally im- 
portant point, by calculating the years which

150 years, as above presupposed : or—and perhaps 
this is more advisable—it might form a conclusion of 
the second main period of modern history (1648-1789), 
and be introductory to the last section (1789-1815). 
Here I assume the latter plan to be adopted. My 
information is derived from Biedermann’s excellent 
work— Deutschland im 18. Jahrhundert, vol. i. (Leip- 
sic, 1854). | 
At the present day the German Empire is in- 
habited by some 56,000,000 inhabitants, and has 
an area of 540,000 square kilometres, comprising 
twenty-six States ; the largest of these—Prussia— 
has 348,000 square kilometres and 32,000,000 in- 
habitants ; and the smallest—the town of Lubeck— 
has 297 kilometres and 97,000 inhabitants. All of 
these States, with the exception of the three re- 
publican towns, are governed by hereditary monar- 
chies ; the Prince shares the legislative power with 
an elected assembly of representatives, and the rights 
of the citizens are protected by a written constitu- 
tion, a State charter. The administration, military 
service, finance, justice, and education are regulated 
by law, within which law every German can give 
free expression to his opinions; religious creed 
makes no difference in the enjoyment of those rights 
_ which every citizen can claim. 
We shall now attempt to realize some features of 
the picture which our country presented 150 years 
ago, in the second half of the eighteenth century. 
Upon an area of 12,000 square miles—some 
3,000 more than the present German Empire in-

APPENDIX 213 
cludes—lived, about the middle of the previous 
century, from 26,000,000 to 30,000,000 inhabitants. 
A motley assemblage of large, small, minor and 
insignificant territories or States were distributed, 
since 1510, into ten circles. Of such territorial 
States, with less than 120 square miles, the German, 
or rather the Roman, Empire included about eighty ; 
to these must be added about thirty lordships and 
1,400 to 1,600 knights’ estates. All these had the 
right or the power to inflict damage upon their 
neighbours, their own subjects, or the Empire at 
large, by customs dues, prohibitions of trade, and 
industrial monopolies, and that hateful symbol of 
sovereign power, the gallows, was to be found in 
the smaiiest State. 
The Emperor was of little importance. Upon 
the occasion of his coronation at Frankfort-on- 
Maine, he came upon the scene with great splendour. 
On that occasion the hereditary officials, of whom 
we have heard, performed their functions ; forty-four 
ruling Counts carried the dishes to the Coronation 
meal. We have previously read in our reading-book 
the incomparable description by Goethe of the elec- 
tion and coronation of the Archduke Joseph, after- 
wards the Emperor Joseph II., as Roman King in 
1764. The Emperor then signed the capitulations 
of election, in which the most important point was 
that the several States and territories were every- 
thing, and the Emperor himself was nothing. The 
Emperor had no power abroad, for the Princes and 
estates possessed the right of concluding treaties 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  214 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
with one another and with foreign countries. He 
had equally little power at home, for the privileges 
ot the estates to which he was obliged to swear 
embraced complete domestic power, and he was ex- 
pressly obliged to renounce any idea of making his 
position hereditary in his own family. After this 
he entered upon the enjoyment of his legal rights, 
and the extent of these can be estimated by the 
income which the Emperor gained from the Empire 
—a sum of 14,000 florins annually. 
At the same time, the person of the Emperor was 
the one point of unity for the Empire ; the Imperial 
Diet which met at Regensburg implied no bond of 
union. In unimportant affairs it might be possible 
to unite the three chambers of the Diet—the college 
of Electors, the college of Princes, and the college of 
the Imperial Towns for co-operation with the Em- 
peror ; in important affairs, however, this was im- 
possible. Even more ominous was the fact that 
when religious questions were under discussion no 
majority vote was taken, but the Diet divided into 
two corporations —the Corpus Evangelicorum and. 
the Corpus Catholicorum ; decision was thus impos- 
sible, though some understanding might be secured 
after long negotiation. Moreover, every important 
affair could be represented in the last resort as a 
religious matter. Questions, even if they had no 
connexion with religion, were naturally retained for 
years upon the “Imperial agenda”; when they 
at length came up for discussion they were im- 
mediately referred to a preparatory committee ;
-P-A-G-E-237
APPENDIX 215 
debate began, and claims, points of privilege, mis- 
givings, objections, provisos, and so forth, came in 
from all sides; resolutions, protocols, protests, 
clauses were infinite. Should some decision have 
eventually been secured, executive power was 
wanting, and there were no pecuniary resources, 
so that it was necessary to turn to the goodwill of 
individual states, and this was generally far to seek. 
We may take an instance which extends throughout 
the century. In the peace of Ryswick in 1697 
Kehl and Philippsburg were restored to the Empire, 
and the Diet resolved to repair or to keep in repair 
the latter fortress; the necessary money, the 
‘“ Roman months ”—in the strange expression of the 
time—was voted, but was still unpaid seventy years 
later. In 1714 the proposals for repair were re- 
peated ; in 1716 an Imperial rescript was issued ; 
the piteous requests of the unpaid workmen were 
noted in the document, and the matter was allowed 
to drop until 1753, when it was resolved that all 
improvements which necessitated expense should be 
indefinitely postponed, and this resolution, at all 
events, was punctiliously carried out. Eventually 
the fortresses were handed over to the Margrave 
of Baden, and in 1782 the last fifteen men composing 
the Imperial garrison were withdrawn. The condi- 
tion of the military organization we have already 
seen in discussing the Battle of Rossbach; the 
company, in which the captain was nominated by an 
Imperial Count, the first lieutenant by an Imperial 
town, and the second by a royal abbess, is but an 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  216 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
example, and by no means the worst instance of this 
extraordinary military procedure. Remarkable, 
too, is the strict equality of creed that was main- 
tained ; the general staff must contain an equal 
number of Catholic and Evangelical marshals and 
generals of cavalry. Wherever we turn our eyes 
we observe a similar picture of a mechanism utterly 
paralyzed. At the same time some notion of 
national unity was observable, and there was some 
belief in the supreme authority of the Empire m 
the single department of jurisprudence; there was 
still an Imperial Court of Justice (Reichskammer- 
gericht), which had been held in Wetzlar from 1693, 
as none of the larger Imperial towns would admit 
it ; nor was there any lack of legal business ; in the 
year 1772 there were no less than 61,233 unheard 
cases before this court. Procedure was indefinitely 
protracted, and most lawsuits extended beyond the 
lifetime of prosecutor, defendant, witnesses, judge, 
. and the point at issue. There was also at Vienna an 
authority immediately constituted by the Emperor 
—the Imperial Court Council ( (Reichshofrath)—which 
upon occasion reinstated some injured subject in his 
rights when one of the small potentates was con- 
cerned, such as the Prince of Reuss ; the more im- 
portant rulers paid no attention to any decision or 
threatened interference on the part of the Imperial 
Court Council. 
Thus, for good or evil, the condition of the nation 
was determined by the good or bad intentions of 
the individual territorial lords, In their own dis-
-P-A-G-E-239
APPENDIX 217 
tricts their power was unlimited, and the provincial 
estates were no check upon its exercise, though they 
had formerly been powerful, with the exception of 
certain territories such as the Duchy of Wurtemburg, 
where, however, conditions of life were anything but 
agreeable for this very reason. It is a period of 
princely absolutism ; its outset was influenced most 
unfavourably by the example of Louis XIV. in the 
direction of empty show, royal pomp and splendour, 
and reckless extravagance, while at its close a para- 
mount influence was that of Frederick the Great 
and of his opponent, the Emperor Joseph II. At 
the same time this princely absolutism was also pro- 
ductive of much good. The absolute Prince ruled 
through his officials; these were wholly dependent 
upon the Prince, and were treated by the smaller 
Princes as mere servants ; the Emperor Joseph II. 
was the first to address them courteously, though he 
bitterly complained of their unwillingness to co- 
operate in his humanitarian and reforming préjects, 
and of their readiness to accept bribes. Frederick IT. 
was more successful, as his ancestors, and especially 
his father, had striven to create a careful, indus- 
trious, and conscientious class of officials. Frederick 
was able to inspire them with a feeling of respect for 
the State, and the South German officials held their 
North German colleagues in high esteem. Among 
the petty States of Southern Germany official ad- 
ministration was extremely bad. Officials, treated 
as servants by the supreme authority, protected 
themselves by harsh and corrupt administration.
-P-A-G-E-240
        218 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Their pay was scanty and irregular, apart from their 
other hardships ; for instance, a Prince of Ottingen 
borrowed, in separate sums, 17,000 florins from his 
chief paymaster ; when the latter respectfully re- 
quested payment, he was dismissed from office, and 
the difficulty was not arranged until a century later, 
by a grant of 3,000 florins to the heirs of this official. 
Evils of this kind are inconceivable at the present 
day, for the reason that the injured party, before 
appealing to justice, can easily secure publicity by 
means of our highly developed press. The press, or 
the publicity, as it was then called, was in those 
days but scanty; thirty or forty political papers 
have been enumerated in the second half of the 
eighteenth century, as compared with the many 
thousands of the present day. Of these the most 
influential and beneficial was the Correspondent 
(Briefwechsel) of Von Schlozer, a teacher of juris- 
prudence in Gottingen ; this periodical lasted from 
1778 to 1782, and its continuation, the Staatsan- 
zeigen, went on from 1783 to 1792. During its best 
period it enjoyed a circulation of about four thousand 
copies, and Schlézer was in correspondence with 
every class of society, and even with royal Princes ; 
copies of the periodical were to be found upon the 
study table of Joseph II., and even Maria Theresa 
refers to it: “ It may be published by Schlézer ” ; 
‘What will Schlozer say to that?” The leading 
monarchs, Frederick II. and Joseph II., had high 
ideas upon the freedom of the press. The former, in 
his Antimacchiavell of 1741, pleaded the cause of
-P-A-G-E-241
  
  
  APPENDIX 219 
the newspaper very effectively, and in 1781 Joseph 
formed a censorship of enlightened men; such en- 
lightened censors were highly necessary, in view of 
the fact that a censor, who had apparently heard 
something of naturalism, refused to pass the most 
harmless book that ever was written—Rafi’s Natural 
History for Children—which old men like myself have 
read in their early school-days. 
Before the French Revolution politics were not a 
subject of general interest. The evil consequences of 
the Thirty Years’ War and of other wars had not 
been surmounted ; at the same time industrial life, 
on which subject we must say a word, was impeded 
by many obstacles—in one case by an excessive 
number of holidays, which, for instance, in Bavaria 
amounted to one hundred in the year; and in 
another case by forced service of many kinds, as 
when hundreds of peasants were called out to cap- 
ture a deserter. The game and forest laws were in 
many places a heavy burden upon the peasantry ; 
in Anspach, for instance, the peasants were for- 
bidden to keep dogs, to be in possession of guns, 
or even to use clubs, under penalty of imprisonment, 
and were not even allowed to fence in their own 
eround for protection against wild animals. The 
saddest and most disgraceful evidence of the con- 
dition of our country has always been rightly found 
in the trade in mercenary soldiers, which some terri- 
torial lords carried on when England was at war with 
her revolted North American colonies. The num- 
bers are known: from 1777 to 1782, by English
-P-A-G-E-242
        220 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
reckoning, the country sent out 29,160 men, of which 
11,853 perished ; of these Hesse Cassel furnished 
16,992—that is, 4:55 per cent. of its population ; 
those who were permanently injured were not given 
a pension, but a special compensation was paid from 
the State chest. The local ruler followed this pro- 
cedure, as the terms of the convention ran: “ To 
manifest his high devotion to the King of Great 
Britain, and to attest his inherent sympathy with 
the peace and prosperity of the royal States of Great 
Britain.”’ 
A century later, on June 15, 1888, at the opening 
of the first Reichstag under his government, our 
Emperor said : “‘ My love for the German army and 
my position towards it will never induce me to dis- 
turb the benefits of peace unless war should be 
forced upon us by an attack upon the Empire or 
its allies. Our army should secure us in peace, 
and must be able to maintain its honour in the field 
if peace should be broken.”’ But before a German 
Emperor could speak to a German Reichstag of a 
German nation, our nation was obliged to pass 
through a century of deep humiliation and severe 
struggle. 
StxtH Form. 
I do not feel it necessary to give any example of 
the manner in which history should be narrated to 
pupils at this stage, as I have written a lengthy work, 
A History of the World in Four Volumes, the out-

come of years of teaching, narrating, and lecturing 
to Upper and Lower Sixth Forms, which was then 
prepared for the press during a further series of 
years, and for a wider public much on the same 
level of culture as our Sixth-Form boys. This 
work might doubtless be improved, but I cannot 
so improve it, and I will only point out the fact 
that I am wel) aware of the great differences 
existing between written and oral lectures. I 
know that many of my colleagues use that book 
in preparing their narrative lessons, and my own 
confidence in this work, which has accompanied 
me throughout my life, induces me to approve 
their action. The details are, however, too numer- 
ous, especially in the two volumes of modern 
history from 1517 to 1900, to be mastered in the 
two years of a Sixth-Form course. On the other 
hand, the analysis of the matter will be useful to 
younger colleagues, and may save them a consider- 
able amount of trouble; this arrangement, even 
down to comparatively small details, has been 
printed as an analysis in small type in the margin, 
in imitation of the excellent custom prevalent in 
England. | 
All I can do here for these colleagues is to present 
a series of questions and Jeading points for revision 
of every kind and without system for occasional 
use ; these might be infinitely multiplied and im- 
proved. They are confined to the Middle Ages and 
to modern times—the main subject of the two last 
years of the course. I would point out that revision

can also be performed by conjoining some ten or 
twelve questions, as used to be done in the former 
customary examinations; but in this case the 
answers should be given orally by different pupils as 
called upon, and not written. Whenever I have 
been conducting a Form examination for school cer- 
tificates, I have myself been grateful to any colleague 
for good questions, and some useful questions will 
certainly be found in the following collection.

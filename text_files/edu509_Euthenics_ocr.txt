FOREWORD 
Never has society been so clear as to its several special ends, never has 
so little effort been due to chance or compulsion. 
Ralph Barton Perry, The Moral Economy. 
OT through chance, but through in- 
crease of scientific knowledge; not 
through compulsion, but through demo- 
cratic idealism consciously working through 
common interests, will be brought about the 
creation of right conditions, the control of 
environment. 
The betterment of living conditions, 
through conscious endeavor, for the purpose 
of securing efficient human beings, is what 
the author means by EUTHENICS.* 
“FfYuman vitality depends upon two pri- 
mary conditions—heredity and hygiene— 
or conditions preceding birth and condi- 
tions during life.”

Euthenics deals with race improvement 
through environment. 
Eugenics is hygiene for the future gen- 
erations. 
Euthenics is hygiene for the present 
generation. 
Eugenics must await careful investiga- 
tion. 
Euthenics has immediate opportunity. 
Euthenics precedes eugenics, develop- 
ing better men now, and thus inevitably 
creating a better race of men in the future. 
Euthenics is the term proposed for the pre- 
liminary science on which Eugenics must be 
based. 
This new science seeks to emphasize the 
immediate duty of man to better his condi- 
tions by availing himself of knowledge al- 
ready athand. As far as in him lies he must 
make application of this knowledge to se- 
cure his greatest efficiency under conditions 
which he can create or under such existing 
conditions as he may not be able wholly to 
control, but such as he may modify. The
-P-A-G-E-9

knowledge of the causes of disease tends 
only to depress the average citizen rather 
than to arouse him to combat it. Hope of 
success will urge him forward, and it is the 
duty of lovers of mankind to show all pos- 
sible ways of attaining the goal. The tend- 
ency to hopelessness retards reformation and 
regeneration, and the lack of belief in suc- 
cess holds back the wheels of progress. 
Euthenics is to be developed: 
1. Through sanitary science. 
2. Through education. 
3. Through relating science and edu- 
cation to life. 
Students of sanitary science discover for 
us the laws which make for health and the 
prevention of disease. The laboratory has 
been studying conditions and causes, and 
now can show the way to many remedies. 
A knowledge of these laws, of the means 
of conserving man’s resources and vitality, 
which will result in the wealth of human 
energy, is more and more brought within 
the reach of all by various educational 
agencies. 
The individual must estimate properly
-P-A-G-E-10
  x EUTHENICS 
the value of this knowledge in its applica- 
tion to daily life, in order to secure effi- 
ciency and the greatest happiness for him- 
self and for the community. 
Right living conditions comprise pure 
food and a safe water supply, a clean and 
disease-free atmosphere in which to live 
and work, proper shelter, and the adjust- 
ment of work, rest, and amusement. The 
attainment of these conditions calls for 
hearty codperation between individual and 
community—effort on the part of the in- 
dividual because the individual makes per- 
sonality a power; effort on the part of the 
community because the strength of com- 
bined endeavor is required to meet all great 
problems.

The opportunity for betterment is real and 
practical, not merely academic. 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
    Men ignore Nature’s laws in their personal lives. They crave a 
larger measure of goodness and happiness, and yet in their choice of 
dwelling places, in their building of houses to live in, in their selection 
of food and drink, in their clothing of their bodies, in their choice of 
occupations and amusements, in their methods and habits of work, they 
disregard natural laws and impose upon themselves conditions that male 
their ideals of goodness and happiness impossible of attainment. 
Prof. George E. Dawson, The Control of Life through Environment. 
And is it, I ask, an unworthy ambition for man to set before himself 
to understand those eternal laws upén which his happiness, his prosperity, 
his very life depend? Is he to be blamed and anathematized for endeavor- 
ing to fulfill the divine injunction: ‘¢ Fear God and keep His command- 
ments, for that is the whole duty of man’? Before he can keep them, 
surely he must first ascertain what they are. 
Adam Sedgwick. Address, Imperial College of Science and Technology, December 16, 1909. Nature, De- 
cember 23, 1909, p. 228. 
In my judgment, the situation is hopeful. To realize that our 
problems are chiefly those of environment which we in increasing measure 
control, to realize that, no matter how bad the environment of this 
generation, the next is not injured provided that it be given favorable 
conditions, is surely to have an optimistic view.

  CHAPTER I 
It is within the power of every living man to rid himself of every 
parasitic disease. Pasteur. 
UCH facts as the following, showing the 
increase in health, or rather the de- 
crease in disease, go to prove what may be 
done. . 
Since 1882, tuberculosis has decreased 
forty-nine per cent; typhoid, thirty-nine 
per cent. Statistics in regard to heart dis- 
ease and other troubles under personal con- 
trol, however, show increase—kidney dis- 
ease, 131 per cent; heart disease, fifty-seven 
per cent; apoplexy, eighty-four per cent. 
This means that infectious and contagious 
diseases, of which the State has taken cog- 
nizance and to the suppression of which it 
has applied known laws of science, have 
been brought under control, and their exist- 
ence today is due only to the carelessness or 
the ignorance of individuals. 
On the other hand, such results of im- 
proper personal living as do not come under 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-16

legal control—diseases of the heart, kid- 
neys, and general degeneration, matters of 
personal hygiene—have so enormously in- 
creased as in themselves to show the atti- 
tude of mind of the great mass of the peo- 
ple, “Let us eat and drink and be merry, 
what if we do die tomorrow!” 
Probably not more than twenty-five per 
cent in any community are doing a full 
day’s work such as they would be capable 
of doing if they were in perfect health. 
This adds to the length of the school course, 
to the cost of production in all directions, 
to increased taxation, and decreases interest 
in daily life. 
The trouble is that the public does not 
believe in this waste which comes from be- 
ing “just poorly” or “‘just so as to be about.” 
It has no conception of the difference be- 
tween working with a clear brain and a 
steady hand, and working with a dull and 
nerveless tool. It must be convinced of this 
in some way. General warnings have been 
ineffective, and now the appeal is being 
made to the American people on the basis of 
money loss. Thus it has been carefully esti-
-P-A-G-E-17
EUTHENICS 5 
mated that the average economic value of an 
inhabitant of the United States is $2,900. 
The vital statistics of the United States for 
population give 85,500,000. Eighty-five 
million five hundred thousand multiplied 
by $2,900 equals $250,000,000,000 (mini- 
mum estimate), and this exceeds the value 
of all other wealth. The actual economic 
saving possible annually in this country by 
preventing needless deaths, needless illness, 
and needless fatigue is certainly far greater 
than $1,500,000,000, and may be three or 
four times as great. 
Dr. George M. Gould estimated that 
sickness and death in the United States cost 
$3,000,000,000 annually, of which at least 
one-third is regarded as preventable. 
From all sidés comes testimony to the 
decrease in personal efficiency of workers 
of all degrees. Medical science has pro- 
longed life, hospitals and visiting nurses 
have made sickness less distressful, but have 
also in many cases prolonged the time and 
increased the cost. Sanitary science aims to 
prevent the beginnings of sickness, and so to 
eliminate much of the expense. ©

The discovery that the mosquito is the 
carrying agent for the yellow fever germ 
has saved more lives annually than were lost 
in the Cuban War. In the yellow fever epi- 
demic of 1872, the loss to the country was 
not less than $100,000,000 in gold. 
“With our present population there are 
always about 3,000,000 persons in the United 
States on the sick list... . By means of Farr’s 
table, we may calculate that very close to a 
third, or 1,000,000 persons, are in the work- 
ing period of life. Assuming that average 
earnings in the working period are $700, 
and that only three-fourths of the 1,000,000 
potential workers would be occupied, we 
find over $500,000,000 as the minimum loss 
of earnings. 
“The cost of medical attendance, medi- 
cine and nursing, etc., is conjectured by 
Dr. Biggs in New York to be from $1.50 
each per day for the consumptive poor to 
a greater amount for other diseases and 
classes. Applying this to the 3,000,000 years 
of illness annually experienced, we have 
$1,500,000,000 as the minimum annual cost 
of this kind.
-P-A-G-E-19
EUTHENICS vi 
“The statistics of the Commissioner of 
Labor show that the expenditure for illness 
and death amounts to twenty-seven dollars 
per family per annum. This is for work- 
ingmen’s families only. But even this fig- 
ure, if applied to the 17,000,000 families 
of the United States, would make the total 
bill caring for illness and death $460,000,- 
ooo. The true cost may well be more than 
twice this sum. Certainly the estimate is 
more than safe, and is only one-third of the 
sum obtained by using Dr. Biggs’s estimate. 
The sum of the costs of illness, including 
loss of wages and cost of care, is thus $460,- 
000,000 plus $500,000,000 equals $960,000,- 
ooo. ... At least three-quarters of the costs 
are preventable.” *

a year is estimated by various authorities as:

home to the people the possibilities of race 
betterment. One company sends out among 
its policy holders trained nurses, who give 
plain talks on health subjects and offer prac- 
tical suggestions as to hygienic living. This, 
to be sure, is on the economic basis of money 
saving, but if that is the only thing that 
will appeal to the people is it not wise to 
seize upon it as a lever to lift the standard 
of well-being? 
The possibility of saving the enormous 
sums that are lost by reason of premature 
deaths was an alluring subject to the in- 
surance men. It gave to the world what, 
up to that time, it had lacked—a body of 
powerful men who recognized that they 
had a financial interest in preventing the 
needless death of men and women. 
A table has been prepared showing that 
if insurance companies were to expend 
$200,000 a year for the purely commercial 
object of reducing their death losses, and 
should thereby decrease them only twelve 
one-hundredths of one per cent, they would 
save enough to cover the expense. 
“Tf such a plan as this were placed on
-P-A-G-E-21
  
EUTHENICS 9 
a purely scientific basis and carried out by 
good business methods, and all the com- 
panies pulled together for the common 
good, I should expect a decrease in death 
claims of more than one per cent; and a 
decrease in the death claims of one per cent 
would mean that the companies would save 
more than eight times as much as they ex- 
pended, or would make a net saving of more 
than seven times the expense, which would 
be about a million and a half dollars a year.” 1 
“While it would be impossible to state in 
general terms how rich a return lies ready 
for public or private investments in good 
health, these examples (life insurance) 
show that the rate of this return is quite 
beyond the dreams of avarice. Were it 
possible for the public to realize this fact, 
motives both of economy and of humanity 
would dictate immediate and generous ex- 
penditure of public moneys for improving 
the air we breathe, the water we drink, the 
food we eat, as well as for eliminating the

dangers of life and limb which now sur- 
round us.” * 
Undoubtedly a moral force is to be 
strengthened by spreading the biological 
lesson that man cannot live to himself alone, 
but that his acts or failure to act affect a 
large number of his fellowmen. Also, a 
stimulus to personal ambition is to be sup- 
plied in the suggestion of better health and 
consequently more money to spend as a 
result. 
Civic pride and private gain will be 
brought into the endeavor to show man that 
to understand himself, to exercise the same 
control over his activities that he uses over 
his machines, is to double his capacity, not 
only for work, but for pleasure. This con- 
trol is now possible through the application 
of recently confirmed scientific knowledge 
as to man’s environment. 
It is the aim of this book to arouse the 
thinking portion of the community to the 
opportunity of the present moment for in} 
/culcating such standards of living as shall \ 
\tend to the increase of health and happiness. /

    The hope is springing up in some minds that the entire problem of 
human regeneration will be much simplified when men shall have learned

the spirit of man which is set to subdue it.

There are two recognized ways of improving the quality of human 
beings: one by giving them a better heredity — starting them in life with 
a stronger heart, better digestion, steadier nerves; the other by so com- 
bining the factors of daily life that even a weak heart may grow strong, 
a poor digestion may become good, and frayed nerves gain steadiness.

HE relation of environment to man’s 
efficiency is a vital consideration: how 
far it is responsible for his character, his 
views, and his health; what special elements 
in the environment are most potent and 
what are the most readily controlled, pro- 
vided sufficient knowledge can be gained of 
the forces and conditions to be used. 
To this end home life—in its relations 
to the child, the adult, and the community— 
is considered in connection with the effect 
on the home of the influences outside it, and 
the reaction of each on the other. These 
relations and influences are partly physical 
and material, partly ethical and psychical. 
The right of the child is protection, and 
it is the responsibility of the adult—parent, 
teacher, or state officer—to secure this pro- 
tection. 
The knowledge that investigators are 
gaining in the laboratory and are trying to 
15
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 EUTHENICS 
give to the community must be accepted and 
applied by the individual. How is the in- 
dividual, discouraged by sickness and hard- 
ship, to know that things are awry or that 
they can be set more nearly straight? How 
can he know that he is responsible for his 
limitations? Why should he suppose that 
he need not be eternally a slave to environ- 
ment? How can he realize that “health 
promotes efficiency by producing more 
energy and leaving it all free for useful 
purposes?” A few enlightened souls recog- 
nize the tendency of environment to kick 
the man that is down; to be subservient to 
the man of bodily and mental vigor, of keen 
understanding and human insight, but the 
majority must be led to believe these scien- 
tific principles. 
Again and again scientists and humani- 
tarians must return to the attack, for in- 
dividual carelessness becomes community 
menace, and “line upon line and precept 
upon precept” they must present their 
knowledge in language that shall attract 
and hold the attention and fancy. So the 
work and discoveries of Metchnikoff have
-P-A-G-E-29
  EUTHENICS 17 
gained credence because the disciple who 
described them had the ability to impress on 
his audience in a convincing fashion the one: 
fact that made a strong appeal—the possi- 
bility of long life. it those who-are zealous 
for any movement would study the psychol- 
ogy of advertising and speak as forcefully 
as the legitimate advertiser, they would be 
more persuasive and successful.) 
When an idea has won in a certain circle, 
it quickly spreads to the other members, 
thence to active communities. So the uni- 
versal law of imitation may be the greatest 
help in the spread of ideas. The individual 
eats a certain food because his neighbor 
does. Boston determines to make an effort 
for a better city because Chicago has felt 
the stirrings of civic pride. 
A gifted individual with a deep sense 
of the need of his community sees an ideal 
condition, which by his thought becomes a 
possibility. These beliefs he shares with a 
few choice spirits till the circle has wid- 
ened. The new ideas come to the notice of 
the city or the town officials, new means are 
adopted of educating the whole commu- 
   
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 EUTHENICS 
nity, and, if necessary, legal measures are 
passed. But the new means to betterment 
must be applied by the individual. Begin- 
ning with the exceptional individual and 
ending with the average individual, the 
perfect circle is rounded out. 
The leaders must show convincingly 
that the laws which they have discovered 
may be applied to daily life, but the ind:- 
vidual himself must adopt them. When he 
has been saturated with knowledge, his in- 
ertia will break down, his hopelessness give 
way to its very antithesis, a strong hope for 
a better future. Every known method must 
be used by the laboratory to develop this 
hope into a belief wide enough to reach all 
members of every section of the community 
and deep enough to become a vital working 
principle. Only through a belief strong 
enough to ride over unbelief and inertia, 
a belief in the value of science for personal 
life strong enough to make a wise choice 
possible, can the will to obtain a better 
environment be developed. The belief in 
better things must be thoroughly impressed 
on the individual mind. Each individual 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
EUTHENICS 19 
must understand that it does affect him, that 
it is his concern, that he must give heed to 
his environment. Then he may have the 
will and make the effort to combat dangers 
to body and mind. 
Today, belief is much more difficult than 
ever before because the dangers are unseen 
and insidious, and our enemies do not gen- 
erally make an appeal through the senses 
of sight and hearing. But the dangers to 
modern life are no less than in the days of 
the pioneers, when a stockade was built as 
a defense from the Indians. We have no 
standards for safety. Our enemies are no 
longer Indians and wild animals. Those 
were the days of big things. Today is the 
day of the infinitely little. To see our cruel- 
est enemies, we must use the microscope. 
Of all our dangers, that of uncleanness leads 
—uncleanness of food and water and air— 
uncleanness due to unsanitary production 
and storage, to exposure to street dust, or to 
cooking and serving of food in unclean ves- 
sels. Such conditions result not only in 
actual disease, but in lowered vitality and 
lessened work power. 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 EUTHENICS 
Lack of knowledge on the part of some, 
heedlessness on the part of others who 
should be intelligent enough to interpret 
such conditions, are responsible for their 
continuance. A few timely suggestions 
will accomplish more in remedying many 
evils than any amount of attempted legal 
enforcement. The very fact of a law makes 
many persons defy it. They feel justified 
in showing their wit by outwitting the 
law’s representatives. Many of our newer 
citizens have come to us from the protec- 
tion (?) of a personal authority that they 
can see and feel. In this country of ours, 
we have taken away that binding regard for 
authority, and we must as far as possible 
lead rather than compel. 
It is, after all, what a man determines 
for himself and for his family that affects 
both his views of life and his wish to secure 
for himself and for them that which he be- 
lieves to be best. It is not what some other 
man believes for him that affects his life. 
Evolution from within, not a dragging 
from outside, even if it is in the right direc- 
tion, is the method of human development.

Nevertheless, if the bale of hay is skillfully 
hung in front of the donkey’s nose it will 
often serve to start the wheels on an easy 
road. 
Evidence of the value of concerted 
effort by individuals and of the power of 
suggestion was given by a woman’s club in 
a small town. The members became aware 
of the dangers in exposed food, and on in- 
vestigation found their own market to be 
very low in standards of cleanness. At a 
certain meeting they agreed to ask the pro- 
prietor why he did not protect this and 
cover that article. Certain members were 
told off for the duty and the days agreed 
upon. Mrs. A., making her usual pur- 
chases, casually asked why such an article 
was not covered. “I never thought about 
it,” was the answer. Mrs. B., the next day, 
asked why such an article was left out for 
the flies. ‘I never thought about the flies.” 
Mrs. C. asked the same question on the 
third day. The proprietor said: “You're 
the third woman who has asked me that. 
No one ever suggested it before, but it 
would be a good idea.” Before the end of}
-P-A-G-E-34
22 EUTHENICS 
two weeks the provisions and groceries were 
covered. The end had been gained without 
resort to coercion. 
We know that our capacity for mental 
and bodily work depends on our supply of 
food. Proper food is necessary as a source 
of power for the work of the body as well 
as to furnish material for growth and repair 
of the losses of the body. Taking food is 
the most interesting of the vital processes. 
It appeals to all the senses (except hearing). 
Professor Dawson calls attention to the 
fact that the richest food areas in the world 
have provided the most powerful stocks of 
men of which we have any record, and it 
has been pointed out by many that im- 
proper food is closely connected with 
mental and moral defects. Strong men and 
women are not the product of improper 
food. Dr. Stanley Hall says: “The neces- 
sity of judicious, wholesome food is para- 
mount. ... You can educate a long time by 
externals and not accomplish as much as 
good feeding will accomplish by itself. 
Children must be supplied with plenty of 
nutritious food if they are to develop health- 
ily either in mind or body.”

Mr. Robert Hunter says: “All that we 
are, either as individuals or as a complexly 
constituted society of men, is made possible 
by the food supply. . . . Perhaps more than / 
any other condition of life it lies at the/ 
door of most of the Banish and mental int 
equalities among men.’ we 
In these days of irresponsibility there is 
probably more harm done to the health by 
ignoring physical law in the matter of eat- 
ing than in any other one thing. 
It is in the study of food substances and 
their possibilities in relation to better sani- 
tary conditions that the widest field is open 
to housekeepers, and the subject should be 
especially fascinating to women of educa- 
tion and ability. All the skill and knowl- 
edge of the best educated women should be 
enlisted in the cause of better food for the 
people. Certainly no subject, except that 
of pure air, can have a closer bearing on the 
health than right diet. Much sound teach- 
ing will be needed before bad habits of 
eating and drinking will be conquered.

that of the farmer and of the fisherman, 
will have the power to assimilate almost 
anything, and can maintain abundant health 
on the coarsest food poorly prepared, pro- 
vided, only, that it is abundant and com- 
posed of the chemical constituents that the 
body requires. 
Only a small proportion of our people, 
however, engage in work of this sort. The 
majority are compelled by occupation, age, 
or health to remain indoors. For them 
nutritious, readily digested food is a requi- 
site. The farmer or the fisherman can 
digest, even thrive upon, food which would 
be deadly for a woman working in a factory. 
In the fourth report of the Massa- 
chusetts State Board of Health (1873), 
Dr. Derby, the secretary, holds that “we 
have good reason to believe that the many 
forms of dyspepsia which are so commonly 
met with among all classes in Massachu- 
setts, in country quite as much as in town, 
are but too often the danger signal that 
Nature gives us to show that the food, either 
in its quality, or its preparation, or its vari- 
ety, is unsuited to maintain the vital proc-

esses. If this warning is rejected, the result 
of malnutrition is frequently chronic disease 
of the so-called major class.” 
/~ Sanitation in relation to food deals first Jos. : with wholesome and clean materials— meat 
from animals free from disease; fruit and 
vegetables free from decay; milk, butter, 
\ete., free from harmful bacteria. The dan- 
gers are the transference to the human body 
of encysted organisms like trichina; of the 
absorption of poisonous substances as toxins 
or ptomaines; of the lodgment of germs of 
disease along with dust on berries, rough 
peach skins, crushed-open fruits; of dirt 
clinging to lettuce, celery, and such vege- 
tables as are eaten raw. 
For the next class of dangers we turn to 
the handling of foods with unclean hands. 
In countless ways disease is spread mys- 
teriously, all due to unclean habits. It is a 
safe precaution to patronize only those res- 
taurants in which the waiters are evidently 
trained to handle the food and vessels with 
care. It will pay well to take care of one’s 
hands and learn sanitary habits when one is 
young; then one will do right without effort.
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 EUTHENICS 
Whatever change of ideas may come with 
increase of knowledge, these habits will not 
need to be unlearned. Without knowing 
the reasons for them, they have been pro- 
claimed in civilized lands. 
It should be the part of the physicians 
to take pains to advise, for most of our peo- 
ple are accessible to ideas; yet from these 
can come no improvement until the people 
are convinced that it is needed. Just as soon 
as the individual fully realizes that he him- 
self is to blame for his suffering or his 
poverty in human energy, he will apply his 
intelligence to the bettering of his condition. 
If he can, in a short time, make as good a 
showing as public effort has made in the 
case of water supplies, he will accomplish 
much for the race. 
Of equal importance to food, in the 
proper care of the human machine, comes 
the air we breathe. 
Many of man’s present physical troubles 
are due to the roof over his head confining 
the warmed, used-up air, which would es- 
cape freely if there were an opening pro- 
vided. The first law of sanitation requires
-P-A-G-E-39
  EUTHENICS 27. 
the quick removal of all wastes. Once- 
breathed air is as much a waste as once-used 
water, and should be allowed to escape. 
Sewers are built for draining away used 
water. Flues are just as important to serve 
as sewers for used air. Air is lighter than 
water, and out-breathed air being warmed 
is lighter than that at room temperature. 
It rises to the ceiling, where it will escape 
if it is allowed to do so before it cools suffi- 
‘ciently to fall. 
The roof also keeps out sunlight, and 
some late investigations indicate that glass 
cuts off some of the most vitally important 
light rays. The “glame” of the Ralston- 
ites—“air in motion with the sunlight on 
it”—may have a scientific basis. 
It will at once be retorted, “ But we can- 
not heat all out-of-doors.” 
A partial reply is: Do not try to make 
your house a tropical jungle. Travelers 
assure us that such an atmosphere is not 
conducive to work or to health. 
All great nations have lived in a temper- 
ate climate, where physical and mental ac- 
tivity was possible for many hours a day.

Science is more and more clearly giving 
reasons for the cooler temperature in cer- 
tain physiological laws. The habits of life 
in regard to air and food are largely under 
individual, or at least under family control, - 
‘and should be studied as personal hygiene. 
The lessons being so clearly taught in 
the treatment of tuberculosis should be 
heeded in forming the general living habits 
of the people. 
If loss of life can be lessened and work- 
ing power increased by man’s effort, why 
does he not make the effort? Why are men 
and women so apathetic over the prevalence 
of disease? Why do they not devote their 
energies to stamping it out? For no other 
reason than their disbelief in the teachings 
of science, coupled with a lingering super- 
stition that, after all, it is fate, not will 
power, which rules the destinies of man- 
kind. 
Perhaps it is too much to expect that 
a sturdy plant of belief should have grown 
since the days of Edwin Chadwick and 
Benjamin Ward Richardson (1830-50), 
less than a century ago, when there were
-P-A-G-E-41
EUTHENICS 29 
perhaps not a dozen men and women who 
believed that man had any appreciable 
control over his own health. 
This early school of sanitarians en- 
deavored to “get behind fate, to the causes 
of sickness.” The modern socionomist is, 
by a study of the mental conditions of com- 
munities, endeavoring to get behind the 
causes of poverty and consequent suffering 
to the reasons for fatal indifference to dirt. 
It is well recognized that in severe sick- 
nesses of many kinds the will to get well is 
more powerful than drugs, that something 
which we call nerve force acting upon the 
physical machine sends a vital current 
through the arteries, coerces the heart to 
renewed pumping action, and life comes 
again to the blanched cheek and glazing 
eye. This more often happens by a mental 
stimulus than by any medicine. In like 
manner the improvement of the body’s 
shell, the home, like that of the soul’s shell, 
the body, comes more often from an inward 
impulse than from outward coercion.

for the child. Therefore stress should be 
laid on the child, its habits, its surround- 
ings, its ideals. By ideals is meant the very 
real stimulus to action coming from within. 
Action must come through the material 
things which ideals control and through 
which they express themselves. 
Certain notions which have crept into 
popular currency need to be corrected be- 
fore the individual can free himself from

advance and improvement. 
Only a small percentage of adults obtain 
the full efficiency from the human machine 
—the only means they have of living, work- 
ing, enjoying. They permit themselves to 
stand and walk badly, they breathe with 
only a portion of their lungs, and so fail 
to furnish the blood stream with oxygen. 
They dress unhygienically. They eat 
wrongly. They exercise little. In short, 
they subject their bodies to abusive treat- 
ment which would ruin any machine. Be- 
cause retribution does not instantly follow 
infraction of Nature’s laws, they become

efficiency in human time and strength is 
one of the lessons to be taught the young 
people, so that they may not waste their 
patrimony. 
The youth feels as rich in his fifty years 
to come as he does with a legacy of $50,000 
in the bank. The years, however, can yield 
only small variations from the established 
rate of interest. The human machine can 
manufacture only a limited amount of 
energy. It remains to utilize that quantity 
to the best advantage. This can be done 
only by having a purpose in life strong 
enough to resist alluring temptations to 
fritter away both time and strength. 
One of the world’s busy workers found 
that the distractions of urban life were 
breaking in upon his working time and 
making inroads upon his physical vitality. 
He recognized that Avork for the body and. 
work for the mind must be balanced, and he 
evolved an acrostic to be followed as a rule 
of life, the fulfillment of which has meant 
prolonged years of efficient work and has 
kept the freshness of middle life with the 
advancing years. Taking the six days of 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 EUTHENICS 
the week as a unit, the acrostic is as 
follows: 
ee The Feast of Life f 
f F Food One-tenth the time 
E Exercise One-tenth the time 
A Amusement One-tenth the time 
S Sleep Three-tenths the time 
2 ‘Task Four-tenths the time 
The first and last are nearly fixed quantities, 
the other three may vary within certain‘ 
limits as to amount of time given and inten- 
sity of effort. Amusement and exercise may 
be taken together; exercise and sleep may 
be somewhat interchangeable. 
The task, or daily work, is a necessity for 
mental and physical health. It should be 
accepted as a part of human life and the 
will and energy should be directed to doing 
it well. It may be a pure delight, the most 
entertaining thing that happens; it should 
be interesting. It is astonishing how inter- 
esting a dull piece of work may become if 
one sets one’s self to doing it well. That 
which one subconsciously knows one is do- 
ing badly is drudgery. The real pleasure 
in life comes not from so-called amusements
-P-A-G-E-45
  EUTHENICS 33 
—things done by other people to make one 
laugh; to “take one’s mind off”—but from 
seeing the work of one’s own hand and 
brain prosper. The work of creation, of 
transformation to desirable result, is the 
purest joy the human mind can experience. 
Fourteen hours a day is not too much for 
this kind of task. The difficulty is to gain 
skill of hand and eye, or training of mind, 
to this end. A fallacy, a canker at the heart 
of our social fabric today, is that the daily 
task is something to be rid of. 
The psychology of doing is clearly illus- 
trated in the character of Fool Billy, as 
drawn by the author of “Priscilla of the 
Good Intent.” 
“Ts there nought ye like better than 
idleness?” asked the blacksmith. “Think 
now, Billy—just ponder over it.” 
“Well, now,” answered the other, after 
a silence, “there’s playing—what ye might 
call playing at a right good game. Could 
ye think of some likely pastime, David?” 
“Ay, could I; blowing bellows is the 
grandest frolic ever I came across.” .. . 
“JT doubt °tis work, David. . .. I  
-P-A-G-E-46
  34 EUTHENICS 
shouldn’t like to be trapped into work. 
*Twould scare me when I woke o’ nights 
and thought of it.” 
“See ye then, Billy”—blowing the 
bellows gently—“is it work to make yon 
sparks go, blue and green and red, as fast 
as ever ye like to drive ’em?” 
“Te-he, ’tis just a bit o’ sport—I hadn’t 
thought of it in that light.” And soon he 
was blowing steadily. 
Later, when David the smith was going 
to America and wished to leave his forge 
with the half-witted Billy, he proposed the 
smith’s work as play. 
“Te-he,” laughed Billy, “am I to play 
wi’ all your fine tools, David?” 
“Ay, just that. I’ve taught ye the way 
o’ them and Dan Foster’s lad from Brow 
Farm shall come and blow the bellows for 
you.” 
“Will that be work for Dan Foster’s 
lad, or play?” 
“Hard work, Billy—grievous hard 
work, while you are just playing at mak- 
ing horseshoes, fence railings, and what 
not.”

Tt is the new view that disease must be understood and overcome ;

We know now that if we do the things we ought to do, we can 
prevent sickness. We have reached a point where it is recognized that 
it is the duty of the community or state to effectually protect itself against 
the ignorant, the selfish, the filthy, and the diseased. We believe now 
that we must have proper sewage disposal, pure water, decent tenements, 
clean streets, good-sized playgrounds, supervision of factories, protection 
of child labor, and pure food.

CHAPTER III 
HOPE 
HE real significance of biological evo- 
lution has not been grasped by the 
people in general. It is that man is a part 
of organic nature, subject to laws of devel- 
opment and growth, laws which he cannot 
break with impunity. It is his business to 
study the forces of Nature and to conquer 
his environment by submitting to the in- 
evitable. Only then will man gain con- 
trol of the conditions which affect his own 
well-being. 
Sickness, we know, is the result of break- 
ing some law of universal nature. What 
that law may be, investigators in scores of 
laboratories are endeavoring to determine. 
In most diseases they have been successful. 
Those remaining are being attacked on all 
sides, and it may be confidently predicted 
that a few years will see success assured. 
Why, then, does sickness continue to be 
the greatest drain upon individual and na- 
39 
   
-P-A-G-E-52
40 EUTHENICS 
tional resources? Because man, through 
ignorance or unbelief, will not avail himself 
of this knowledge, or is behind the times in 
his method. Where wisdom means effort 
and discomfort, many feel it folly to be 
wise. 
The individual may be wise as to his 
own needs, but powerless by himself to 
secure the satisfaction of them. Certain 
concessions to others’ needs are always made 
in family life. The community is only a 
larger family group, and social conscious- 
ness must in time take into account social 
welfare. Moreover, a neighbor may pol- 
lute the water supply, foul the air, and 
adulterate the food. This is the penalty 
paid for living in groups. Men band to- 
gether, therefore, to protect a common 
water supply, to suppress smoke, dust, and 
foul gases which render the common air un- 
fit to breathe. The State helps the group to 
protect itself from bad food as it does from 
destruction of property. 
The development of fire protection is a 
good example of community effort. The 
isolated farmhouse may have buckets of 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
aka al ita ah 
EUTHENICS 41 
water and blankets in an accessible place 
with which to put out an incipient fire. 
Then eight or ten families build close to- 
gether. The danger of one becomes the 
danger of all, and a fire brigade is organized 
that may protect all. When hundreds of 
families crowd together in a small space 
the danger becomes so much the greater 
that a paid department with efficient appa- 
ratus is necessary. No one complains of 
the infraction of individual rights. Each 
one is glad to pay his share of the expense. 
In securing protection from other dan- 
gers, the individual and the family unit are 
fast relying on community regulations. . In 
fact, in many ways the individual, when he 
becomes one of a crowd, must go whither 
the crowd goes and at the same rate of 
progress. 
Failure to recognize that by coming into 
the community he has forfeited his right to 
unrestrained individuality causes an irrita- 
tion as unreasonable as harmful. 
A certain control of sanitary conditions 
must be delegated to the community and its 
rules cheerfully followed. The legal as- 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  42 EUTHENICS 
pects of these rules will be considered in a 
later chapter. Here is to be considered 
only the mental attitude with which the 
members of the community should come 
together to agree upon a common defense 
against disease and dirt. The spirit of co- 
operation must prevail over a tendency to 
antagonism when certain individual rights 
seem to be involved. 
Numbers of families living close to- 
gether are served by the same grocer or 
market man. These families may agree 
upon their requirements as to quality and 
cleanliness and publish their rules. If they 
do not take interest enough to protect them- 
selves, the community must make rules for 
them. If the local officials are not vigilant 
enough, the State may step in and compel 
the observance of sanitary regulations. 
The average citizen learns of the exist- 
ence of a health regulation when he is 
warned that he has broken it, or perhaps is 
fined. His first attitude is rebellion at the 
invasion of his personal liberty. The house- 
wife usually takes the ground that the rule 
is absurd or unnecessary.
-P-A-G-E-55
EUTHENICS 43 
When, in the interest of the community, 
any law is to be enforced, how are the peo- 
ple to be led from this rebellious state of 
mind? Perhaps first through authority. 
In America we have learned to use the 
phrase, “Big Stick.” Authority is exactly 
that; it is coercion from without. It has 
partial result in good; the law may be ful- 
filled because the individual knows he must 
obey when within the jurisdiction of that 
law; but if the result is simply obedi- 
ence to authority and not to the underlying 
principle, it will not be a force in his life 
or be continued if by chance he can escape 
it. He will be a “tramp” in his methods 
of obedience. This method can never be 
constructive; its value lies in the possibility 
that by continuous usage or repetition the 
procedure may become a habit, and from 
habit will come reason and intelligence. 
But the more direct and efficient way to 
help the individual to realize his relation to 
communal right living is through education. 
The former method—blind obedience— 
will foster the spirit of antagonism and call 
the State’s protection “interference,” thus 
     
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 EUTHENICS 
weakening the efficiency of the State and of 
the individual, for the State is the multipli- 
cation of its citizens; but through the latter 
method the individual will carry out the 
law with intelligence and interest. This 
will be constructive and it will be perma- 
nent, for again, if the State is the sum of 
its citizens, the efficiency of the State is the 
sum of the efficiency of the citizens. 
Their interests are now identical, the 
man has become equal master with the 
State; they areco-partners. His motive for 
right living is greater than the letter of the 
law, for he is the living law, the protest 
against wrong and the fulfillment of the 
right. 
The next generation must be born with 
healthy bodies, must be nurtured in healthy 
physical and moral environments, and must 
be filled with ambition to give birth to a 
still healthier, still nobler generation. But, 
as has been said, “whatever improvements 
may sometime-be achieved, the benefits of 
their influence can be enjoyed only by 
future, perhaps distantly future genera-
-P-A-G-E-57
  EUTHENICS 45 
tions. We of the present have to take our 
heredity as we find it. We cannot follow 
the advice of a humorous philosopher to 
begin life by selecting our grandparents; 
but through hygiene (sanitary science) we 
can make the most of our endowment.” * 
There is a force in the development of 
public opinion somewhere between indi- 
vidual action and national compulsion 
which may be termed ‘“‘semi-public” action. 
It is in a measure the same sort of influence 
that in a later chapter is termed “stimula- 
tive education.” For instance, a hospital 
for the treatment of some special ailment is 
needed. Private enterprise furnishes the 
capital, proves the success of the treatment, 
and then the community comes forward and 
supports the institution. Such helps are 
accepted freely and are not considered un- 
democratic. 
The less spectacular but more effective 
office of prevention of the need for charity, 
in the maintenance of cleanness in the mar- 
kets, streets, and shops, yes, even in the 
homes of the people, has been neglected. 
Through lack of belief, and especially 
1 Report cn National Vitality, p. 55.

  46 EUTHENICS 
through inattention to causes so common as 
to escape notice, many details of great hy- 
gienic importance have been overlooked. 
Some daring ones in commercial ven- 
tures are showing the possibilities of a 
standard in cleanness, and model establish- 
ments, dairies, bakeries, and restaurants 
should receive the hearty support of a com- 
munity. If they do not receive this sup- 
port, it is more than discouraging to the 
promoters, for it costs to be clean, a lesson 
the community must learn. The saving of 
money and the consequent loss of life 
through disease, or the spending of money 
and the saving of life through prevention, 
are the alternatives. 
Undoubtedly the old view of charity as 
tenderly caring for the sick—because there 
must always be a certain amount of sick- 
ness in the world—has held men back from 
attempting to make a world without sick- 
ness. The charity worker of the past had 
no hope of really making things better 
permanently. 
The new view, based upon scientific 
investigation, is that it is not charity that
-P-A-G-E-59
EUTHENICS 47 
is needed to support invalids who once 
stricken must fade away, but preventive 
action to give the patient hope and fresh 
air. Most important of all, the experi- 
ence already gained shows how far from 
the truth was the old fatalistic notion of the 
necessary continuance of disease. 
While the support of many agencies— 
dispensaries, clinics, hospitals, sanatoria, 
etc.—must for a time depend upon private 
. philanthropy, the expense is in the nature 
of an investment to bring in a high rate’ of 
interest in the future welfare of the race. 
As soon as the belief in the efficiency of 
these agents reaches the taxpayer he will 
willingly furnish the funds for public 
agencies. 
Today the child in the school is exam-

strengthen himself as to combat the ravages 
of disease.

City, not only sends bread to fill the hungry

thetic worker to help women to understand 
food and money values, which means a per- 
manent help. And it no longer simply says 
to the tired, worried woman who has had no 
education-stimulus along the line of clean- 
ness, “Be clean,” but sends in women to 
make the house an example, an exhibit of 
clean conditions, if you will. Example is 
stronger than precept. 
In the rapid growth of cities, so often 
beyond anticipation, preparation for de- 
velopment or plans for extension have 
seldom been laid. Much suffering has been 
wrought to the families of men in our 
crowded cities, for there is no greater evil 
than the congestion of streets and buildings. 
Many students of social conditions of 
today believe that the most serious menace 
is the situation best described as housing— 
the site, the crowding, the bad building, 
poor water supply and drainage, lack of 
light and air and cleanliness. All believe 
that it is economically a loss to the city in 
general, however profitable to a very few.
-P-A-G-E-61
EUTHENICS 49 
To rent such buildings is a far greater crime 
than cruelty to animals or even the beating 
of women and children. 
But groups of people the wide world 
over are keenly awake to this state of affairs, 
and though the problem is tremendous they 
are trying in numerous ways to solve it. 
In some cities there are at present organ- 
izations urging ‘city planning,’ while in 
several foreign cities the municipality has 
already made regulations. In some cities 
there are municipal model tenements, but 
this is still a project of too small proportions 
to affect the community. 
Perhaps no modern movement that com- 
prehends both the city planning and the 
housing of the working people is more ideal 
than the “Garden Cities’ movement in 
England and the other countries following 
it. : 
If there is any spot on which the hand 
of the law should be laid, it is the congested 
districts in cities and mill villages. The 
evil has grown to such magnitude that the 
first steps will mean some drastic measures.

depends on local conditions, and thereon 
cause to be erected habitations decently 
comfortable, wholly sanitary, and place 
over each group an inspector as both agent 
and teacher who shall be a friend to the 
tenants, and to whose office they may come 
freely with their needs. This plan has been 
in part carried out in the Model Tenements 
in New York, but variations and improve- 
ments are needed. There should be more 
light and air, more grass and trees, even if 
the buildings are fifteen-story towers. 
The old story has been so often reiter- 
ated, “But the tenants will not use the 
devices,” that the capitalist has become cal- 
lous to this appeal. The missing link in 
the chain has been the instruction to go with 
the construction. 
All department stores, all venders of 
new mechanical appliances, have come to

instruction, in the use of articles as an aid 
to purchase. The advocate of better dwell- 
ings must take a leaf from the commercial 
book and show how. It is in this that phi- 
lanthropy has been weak in the past. It 
has assumed a power to see, where there 
was only a fear of handling the strange 
objects. 
There is a virgin field for the capitalist 
who wishes to use some millions for the 
prosperity of the country to build a short 
trolley line to a district of sanitary houses 
with gardens, playgrounds, entertainment 
halls, etc.; such a village to contain, not 
long blocks, but both separate houses and 
tenements from two rooms up, possibly 
several stories high, where the elders may 
have light and air without the confusion of 
the street. Dust and noise will be elimi- 
nated. There should be a central bakery 
and laundry, and, most important of all, 
an office where both men and women skilled 
in sanitary and economic practical affairs 
may be found ready to go to any home and 
advise on any subject. There has never yet 
been such an enterprise with all the ele-

ments worked out. Several, however, have 
shown the way, the Morris houses in Brook- 
lyn, for example. 
It is easier to take a city block and con- 
struct fireproof, high buildings than to solve 
transportation problems. We are losing 
our fear of the high buildings as we see 
the great value of light and air. There is 
chance for work in this direction, for in 
spite of rapid transit some must live in the 
center of things. 
Let a philanthropist or two, instead of 
building hospitals, set some bright young 
architects and sanitarians to devising such 
suitable housing conditions for city and 
suburbs as will obviate the necessity for 
hospitals. Any lover of his kind, any one 
who longs for fame, could find both it and 
the blessing of the homeless by this means, 
and in the end get a fair return for his 
investment. 
The Federal Department of Labor’ has 
studied workingmen’s houses, but living

may carry her trials, like the experiment 
stations which have been provided for the 
farmer. Here is another opportunity for 
the capitalist to hasten the time when the 
' State will supply these. The way will very 
soon be laid out and the first steps taken. 
For the immediate present some stand- 
ard of healthful housing is needed, and now 
that a similar type of house and of apart- 
ment house is being built in all cities and 
towns from one ocean to the other, and from 
Texas to Maine, such a standard is compati- 
ble with conditions. 
A score card for houses to rent would 
save much wrangling. The agent shows the 
card with this house’s rating, and the tenant 
learns that some of his wishes are incom- 
patible with the standard, and some would 
mean a much higher rent than he is willing 
to pay. Professor J. R. Commons, Depart- 
ment of Economics, University of Wiscon- 
sin, has devised a score card to serve the 
house hunter and householder as a standard 
of comparison. This should serve the house 
builder as well, indicating what the demand 
will be forty or fifty years hence.

At present the rating stands somewhat as

Window openings, 11 points 
Air and ventilation, 13 points 
Structural condition, 6 points 
House appurtenances, 26 points

The final score card may vary some- 
what. 
For rent collectors there is also a score 
card. 
Occupants, 100 points 
Congestion of occupancy, 61 points cubic air space 
1,000 cu. ft. per person, no discredit 
600 cu. ft. per person discredits 20 points 
Condition of air and ventilation, 18 points

A score card movement might be started 
as a hobby, and in the end lead public 
opinion to judicial choice and action. No 
such movement, however, is possible with- 
out leaders, and leaders of the right type.

The lesson for the community to be 
drawn from a study of crowd psychology 
is that of leadership and loyal coéperation. 
The common man is likely to be possessed 
of one idea at a time. If such an one be- 
comes a leader, there is danger that equally 
vital factors will be overlooked. Safety is 
found in a combination of leaders to make 
an all-round improvement. 
Each individual is too busy in his own 
affairs to look after his own, much less his 
neighbor’s, health and comfort, hence com- 
munity life, with its advantages, brings its 
own dangers. Children in school in contact 
with other children; crowds in trains, in ele- 
vators, stores, in lecture halls, contract habits 
as well as diseases. The need for large 
quantities of supplies at one point brings 
long-distance transportation and cold stor- 
age difficulties. The man who caters to 
public need does not look far ahead to con- 
sequences, and if unrestrained may prove 
more of a menace than a convenience. 
The safe and reasonable way is to dele- 
gate to certain persons the making and en- 
forcement of regulations corresponding to 
 
-P-A-G-E-68

the needs of the times, and then to obey 
them, even at some personal inconvenience. 
Each community should put into the 
hands of its 
of the rules ‘health officers the carrying out

against outbreaks of disease. Does a man 
let his fire

lance is the price of safety in sanitary as 
well as in military affairs. As in the army, 
the community must delegate scout duty to 
certain chosen individuals and rely on their 
report for s afety.

CHAPTER IV 
FAITH AND HOPE 
ROGRESS is a series of zigzags: now 
the individual goes ahead of the com- 
munity; now the community outstrips the 
individual. 
The community cannot rise much above 
the level of the individual home, and the 
home rises only by the pull of the commu- 
nity regulations, or by the initiative of a few 
especially farsighted individuals. 
The steps need to be carefully measured, 
for if the family begins to rely on the State 
for the backbone it should have, it will not 
stay up, and its fall will be lower than the 
stage it rose from. ‘When man reverts, he 
goes not to Nature, but to death.” 
The example set by the city in maintain- 
ing clean streets and well-kept parks reacts 
upon the home yards. The insistence by the 
police on city regulations as to alleys and 
garbage educates the family as to the gen- 
eral attention to be paid to such things.

  60 EUTHENICS 
The city authorities, on the other hand, 
are prodded to their work by well-informed 
individuals who see the great gain to the 
community from certain measures. 
The centers of movement, civic and 
quasi-religious or philanthropic, are usually 
the outgrowth of individual effort. The 
great movements for betterment—water 
supply, street cleaning, tenement laws, etc. 
—are carried out by community agreement 
with a common tax outlay. 
The clean city means streets of clean 
houses. The clean house in the midst of a 
dirty city may be the match to start a fire of 
cleansing. 
Probably medical inspection in the pub- 
lic school is as good an example as may 
be given of helpfulness to the community. 
No quicker means of influencing both home 
and community life may be found, for in 
five years it might revolutionize the whole. 
School buildings should be so con- 
structed and so managed that they cannot 
themselves either produce or aggravate 
physical defects. Departments of school 
hygiene should be organized, not only in
-P-A-G-E-73
     EUTHENICS 61 
every city, but for every rural school under 
county and state superintendents of instruc- 
tion. The general question of physical 
welfare of children involves too many con- 
siderations to be satisfactorily treated by 
school physician and school nurse alone, or 
by busy teachers and principals. 
“New York City will spend in 1910 
$6,500 for making over twenty rooms in 
regular buildings, a first step in an entirely 
new plan of ventilation, which will eventu- 
ally give outdoor air to all children, sick 
or well.”* 
Speaking generally, America is one of 
the last of the civilized nations to deal with 
the subject of the medical inspection of 
school children upon a comprehensive and 
national scheme. But once aroused to the 
needs, it is safe to say that the nation will 
speedily educate parents to correct such 
home conditions as reduce the child’s abil- 
ity to profit from schooling, and to persuade 
governments to see that safe homes are pro- 
vided. It will be easy to convince the tax- 
payer that it is cheaper to provide such care 
1 Bureau of Municipal Research.
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 EUTHENICS 
than to neglect the future parent and citi- 
zen, for it is easy to prove that medical 
inspection in our schools returns large divi- 
dends on small investments. Dr. Luther 
Gulick says that it seems probable, though 
only a guess, that the total annual expendi- 
ture for medical inspection of schools in the 
United States at the present time is perhaps 
$500,000. The money saved by enabling 
thousands of children to do one year’s work 
in one year, instead of in two or three years, 
would greatly exceed the total expense of 
examining all children in all boroughs.* 
The health of all our school children 
should be conserved by a system of compe- 
tent medical inspection which should se- 
cure the correction of defects of eyes, ears, 
teeth, as well as defects due to infection or 
malnutrition. 
The statistics of medical inspection in 
public schools tell a pitiful tale wherever 
it has been tried: thirty or forty per cent of 
the children are found with defective or 
diseased eyes, ten to twenty per cent with 
distorted spines, fifteen per cent with throat 
1 Quoted in Report on National Vitality, p. 123.
-P-A-G-E-75
  EUTHENICS 63 
and nose troubles, all of which directly 
affect their intellectual proficiency. 
When these deficiencies are discovered 
and reported to the parents, such is the 
apathy of disbelief that seventy-five per 
cent of the cases usually go unattended; 
therefore the school nurse, who follows the 
case home and explains the needs and sets 
forth the penalties, has become a necessity. 
The parent who permits his child to go 
to school physically unfitted to profit from 
school opportunity is not only injuring his 
own child, but is injuring his neighbor’s 
child, and is taxing that neighbor without 
the latter’s consent. 
It would seem as if such parents had 
forfeited their right to the sole care of the 
children, and that government would be 
obliged, for its own protection, to step in 
and do the work while it is needed. The 
author has termed this temporary paternal- 
ism. The providing of penny lunches dur- 
ing the morning recess, the service of the 
school nurse and the home visitor to teach 
those parents who are willing to learn all 
these schemes for the saving of the child, 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 EUTHENICS 
may be carried out in a spirit of helpfulness 
with a support which may be withdrawn 
when no longer needed. 
Although all America has not become 
aroused to the undoubted fact of tendencies 
toward physical deterioration, it is on the 
verge of an awakening. The public school 
is the natural medium for the spread of 
better ideals, and if the teachers of cooking 
and of hygiene would codperate and use all 
the material which sanitary science is heap- 
ing on the table before them, we should 
soon see a betterment of the physical status. 
Combined with medical inspection and 
sanitary construction of schoolhouses, this 
would raise the general health of the com- 
munity thirty or forty per cent in five years 
and fifty to seventy per cent in ten years. 
There has been in some quarters much 
objection to public effort towards remedy- 
ing evils which would not have existed if 
each family had lived up to its duties. The 
community is a larger family, with greater 
resources, and can employ investigators to 
find the means for greater security. That 
individual is very foolish who does not rec- 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  EUTHENICS 65 
ognize this interaction between community 
and individual, and who objects to taking 
the benefits of the larger knowledge. 
To take one of the latest examples of 
social problems: In every thousand children 
in the public schools of any city, probably of 
the town also, there are perhaps fifty who 
are ill-nourished (not necessarily under- 
fed), ill-clothed, unwashed, and deprived 
of good air for sleeping. What is the duty 
of the public? This is one of the burning 
questions of the moment. Send missionary 
teachers to the homes, some say, but that is 
costly; the selection of the suitable mission- 
ary is difficult, and the result may be slight. 
Others say, give one good luncheon at the 
school, for which the children pay in part 
or in whole, and make that an education 
which, by the aid of the school nurse, will 
in time affect a change in habit. In short, 
the problem is this: Shall the children suffer 
_ in childhood and become a burden on soci- 
ety in adult years, or shall society protect 
itself from future expense by community 
care now? “Because finding diseases and 
defects does not protect children unless 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  66 EUTHENICS 
discovery is followed by treatment, fifty- 
eight cities take children to dispensaries 
or instruct at schoolhouses; fifty-eight send 
nurses from house to house to instruct par- 
ents and to persuade them to have their 
families cared for; 1o1 send out cards of 
instruction to parents either by mail or the 
children; while 157 cities have arranged 
special codperation with dispensaries, hos- 
pitals, and relief societies for giving the 
children the shoes or clothing or medical 
and dental care which is found necessary.” * 
Nearly all preventive measures adopted 
by society and ranked as paternalism by 
timid philanthropists are or may be edu- 
cative and temporary at the same time. 
They may be dropped as soon as the end is 
gained. The attention of parents must be 
called to neglected duties. Compulsory 
attention to such duties as affect the wards 
of society, the children, may be needed for 
atime. Just as the wise father, taking the 
child for a walk, allows him to run free as 
soon as his strength and courage permit, so 
the paternalism of society is relaxed as soon

as its protégées show themselves both able 
and willing to do the right thing without its 
aid or command. 
Compulsory school attendance places re- 
sponsibility for certain care, vaccination, 
decent clothing, good food, decent shelter. 
The thousand and one ways in which soci- 
ety is now protecting itself are all educating 
the newcomers to American ideals. They 
are all intended to make efficient, self-sus- 
taining citizens who do not feel the pull of 
the law or the bond of outside care. It 
is the last conflict between the ideals of indi- 
vidualism and those of the community need, 
subordinating the individual preference. 
Much wisdom and forbearance will be 
needed to secure this community ideal, but 
in that way evidently lies progress. It be- 
hooves the leaders of social effort to make 
all their work educational, and thus remove 
the necessity for a repetition in the future. 
Just as the parent in the home estab- 
lishes habits while the child’s mind is plas- 
tic, so the community stands in loco parentis 
to. the future citizen, and surrounds him 
with safeguards while needed. Knowledge

is needed, scientific investigation is funda- 
mental, expert wisdom is indispensable, 
costly though it is, being the product of 
long research and rare brain power. This 
is at the service of the nation for the good 
of all the people, and it is the surer the 
wider the range of experience. For this 
reason chiefly, greater actual knowledge 
and more complete harmonizing of conflict- 
ing interests is necessary. Certain sanitary 
measures are carried out by the Federal 
government as an education to communities, 
just as communities educate individuals. 
Federal effort may be unwisely put forth in 
certain cases, investigations of little conse- 
quence may be undertaken, but on the whole 
a democracy must learn to manage its affairs 
by making mistakes. The principle should 
not be discarded as a result of the first 
mistake. 
The immediate concern of this chapter 
is with the leaders of community move- 
ments, the educated, sympathetic, far- 
sighted sociologists, sanitarians, and econo- 
mists, whose concern is for the advancement 
of mankind. These leaders must have
-P-A-G-E-81
EUTHENICS 69 
courage and belief in the value of their 
work, for no half-hearted means will carry 
the community forward. Still more, they 
must have knowledge, a sure ground to stand 
upon. To acquire this means both time and 
opportunity. To go into betterment work 
without it is to set back the wheels of prog- 
ress, not to advance them.

When human beings and families rationally subordinate their own 
interests as perfectly to the welfare of future generations as do animals 
under the control of instinct, the world will have a more enduring type 
of family life than exists at present. This can only be accomplished by 
the development of controlling ideals which are supported not only by 
reason and intelligence but by ethical impulse and religious motive. 
The home should be considered the place where are to be developed 
and conveyed the precious qualities which are so vital to the continuity of 
the race and the progress of human society and civilization. 
Those factors which are of a more material or physical nature, such 
as shelter, food, dress, and personal health, are to be estimated in their 
relation to mind, character, and effective conduct. 
In the confusion of relative values human health as one of the essential 
means to many worthy ends is usually neglected. Man is the most highly 
developed of all species of animals. He is, to some degree at least, civi- 
lized, and yet human beings are of all animals the sickliest, and this in 
spite of the fact that human health is more important to man and to the 
world than the health of any other creature. And by health I do not 
mean simply existence, freedom from pain, or absence of disease, but 
rather organic power and efficiency, the maximum vital ability possible to 
the individual for the doing of all that seems most worth while in life.

CHAPTER V 
RESPONSIBILITY 
HE ideal of “home” is protection 
from dangers from within—bad 
habits, bad food, bad air, dirt and abuse, 
—shelter, in fact, from all stunting agencies, 
just as the gardener protects his tender 
plants until they become strong enough to 
stand by themselves. The child’s home 
environment is certainly a potent factor in 
his future efficiency. 
But more than physical protection is 
that education in all that goes to make up 
profitable living, acquired by following the 
mother or nurse in her daily round and in 
having legitimate questions answered. Imi- 
tation is the first step in good habits, as in 
learning to walk or to read. That which 
is set before the child should be worthy its 
imitation, and be of value when fixed as a 
habit. Habits of health, correct position, 
deep breathing, clean ways, distaste for 
dirt in one’s person or in one’s vicinity, lik- 
73 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  74, EUTHENICS 
ing for fresh air, for simple food, good 
habits of exercise, of reading, and the thou- 
sand and one trifles that go to make up the 
efficient worker in adult years, all belong 
to the well-ordered home, where, as one 
author puts it, the child is the business of 
the day. 
But the State cannot risk its property 
too far. 
When mothers become so careless or 
ignorant that half their children fail to 
reach their first birthday, and of those that 
live to be three years old a majority are 
defrauded of their birthright of health, 
some agency must step in. 
If the State is to have good citizens it 
must provide for the teaching of the essen- 
tials to a generation that will become the 
wiser mothers and fathers of the next. 
Therefore, even if we regard this as only 
a temporary expedient, we must begin to 
teach the children in our schools, and begin 
at once, that which we see they are no 
longer learning inthehome. “The achieve- 
ment at Huddersfield, England, is espe- 
cially noteworthy. The average annual
-P-A-G-E-87
  EUTHENICS 75 
number of deaths of infants for ten years 
had been 310. By a systematic education 
of mothers the number was in 1907 reduced 
to 212. The cost of saving these ninety- 
eight lives was about $2,000.”* 
One university has established a course 
in the care of children, much to the amuse- 
ment of the press. The United States Com- 
missioner of Education has, however, been 
a responsible mover in the idea. 
But real progress by means of family 
education means the stable family and the 
permanent dwelling. Where is the family 
in the permanent dwelling today? Among 
any class, except the agricultural, where is 
the stable family? 
Since industry has taken woman’s work 
from her, and she has to follow it out into 
the world, the means of education for the 
child has gone from the home. Its atmos- 
phere is artificial, if the attempt is made. 
To work exclusively on the family, for 
the sake of the child, is a very slow process. 
As in all American life, the quicker method 
appeals most strongly. The school is today 
1Dr. Charles H. Chapin. 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  76 EUTHENICS 
the quickest means of reaching both child 
and home; the present home through the 
child, and the future homes through the 
children when they grow up. 
And time presses! A whole generation 
has been lost because the machine ran wild 
without guidance, and all attempt at im- 
provement was met by futile resistance. 
It is very difficult to present the socion- 
omist’s view of the child in the home so 
that it may appeal to the two extremes of 
opinion. There are those who still apply 
medieval rules to twentieth century liv- 
ing; those who believe, honestly, that the 
ideal life was found in the days when the 
mother was the manufacturer in her own 
home and the children were her helpers in 
all the varied processes. “There was never 
any artificial teaching devised so good for 
children as the daily helping in the house- 
hold tasks.” The inference is made that 
therefore the same restriction for the mother 
and the children leads to an ideal life today. 
Such persons fail to realize that the twenti- 
eth century is practically anew world. The 
old rules which related to material things 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  EUTHENICS 77 
hardly hold more closely than they would 
on the planet Mars. The fundamental 
moral principles of reverence, obedience, 
love, and unselfish sacrifice must be worked 
in on a new background. 
To keep the eighteenth century habit, 
so carefully taught the girl, of courtesying 
as she stepped aside to allow the rider or 
the ox cart to pass, in these days of the 
swift automobile, which would be out of 
sight before the knee could bend, is no 
more ridiculous than to expect the average 
young mother to follow the methods of her 
grandmother. Her mother’s ways are now 
pronounced all wrong, not necessarily be- 
cause they were wrong then, but because 
conditions have changed, knowledge has 
been gained, and it is clearly a waste of 
human life, of money, of physical and 
mental power for people to be sick and die 
because the caretaker does not use the 
knowledge in circulation. 
If the young mother can learn how 
better to fulfill her duties by going out of 
the house to lectures or classes, why not? 
Tracts are not always successful as an
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 EUTHENICS 
incentive to conduct. It is obviously im- 
possible to pass a blue law compelling 
parents to conform to—what ideal? The 
school is fast taking the place of the home, 
not because it wishes to do so, but because 
the home does not fulfill its function, and 
so far has not been made to, and the lack 
must be supplied. The personal point of 
view, inculcated now by modern conditions 
of strife for money, just as surely as it must 
have been by barbarian struggle in pre- 
civilized days, must be supplanted by the 
broad view of majority welfare. The 
extreme of the personal point of view, 
expressed in such phrases as “The world 
owes me a living;” “My child is mine to 
treat as I please;” “It is nobody’s business 
how I spend my money;” “TI have a right 
to all the pleasure I can get out of life,” is 
well shown in Mr. H. G. Wells’s analogy’: 
“A cat’s standpoint is probably strictly indi- 
vidualistic. She sees the whole universe as a 
scheme of more or less useful, pleasurable, 
and interesting things concentrated upon 
her sensitive and interesting personality.

EUTHENICS 79 
With a sinuous determination she evades 
disagreeables and pursues delights. Life 
is to her quite clearly and simply a succes- 
sion of pleasures, sensations, and interests, 
among which interests there happen to be 
—kittens.” 
This unsuspicious ignorance of the real 
nature of life is by no means confined to 
animals and savages; it would seem to be 
the common view of many young people 
today. At least they take as little care of 
the homes to which they bring children, 
and they follow the cat’s example in boxing 
the children’s ears and turning them out to 
fend for themselves. 
The last generation seemed to become 
disciples of Schopenhauer in his passionate 
rebellion against the fate that deferred all 
the pleasure of the present to the needs of 
the future generation. Evolution has re- 
vealed the necessity for this subordination 
of the individual lot to the destiny of the 
race, if progress is to be made. The man 
who asserts himself as free from race tram- 
mels is snuffed out as a factor—a blighted 
blossom fallen to earth and trodden under 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 EUTHENICS 
foot. To the student of biological evolu- 
tion, the individual is as a mere pin point 
on the chart of community advance, for 
surely society grows according to evolu- 
tionary law. “As certainly as Nature gives 
the poor child its chance of a good life, 
so certainly do the circumstances of slum 
environment rob it forthwith of its birth- 
right—it is not uncommon to find more 
than half the children of three years of age 
hanging on to life with marks of disease 
and undergrowth firmly implanted on their 
tenderframes. Yet, practically, none of this 
is inherited in the true sense; it is the vic- 
tory of evil human devices in their endeavor 
to cheat Nature of her own. If ever there 
was a mission in the world worthy of the 
most strenuous service, it is to wrest back 
this victory, be it out of pity for suffering 
children or for the very welfare and exist- 
ence of the nation. 
“The schools have made their begin- 
ning; the homes have not yet started; they 
wait the impulse from without. It is for 
voluntary, intelligent opinion to get to work 
on the home, and never to relax until a race
-P-A-G-E-93
  
EUTHENICS 81 
of parents has arisen which knows no other 
duty to the state than to rear with heart and 
brain the children which have been given 
to them. Then we shall hear no more about 
physical degeneracy.”* 
Hope for the future is to be found in 
the conclusions of the immigration commis- 
sion, that in one generation certain marked 
changes in stature and in head measure- 
ments have taken place in the children of 
immigrants of various nationalities, such 
changes as have hitherto been considered as 
the result of centuries. The commissioners 
credit the better environment and larger 
opportunities with these indications of in- 
creasing intellectuality and mental force. 
Most human efficiency is the result of 
habits rather than of innate ability. These 
habits of mind, as well as of body, are de- 
veloped by the home life at an early age. 
The home is responsible for the upbringing 
of healthy, intelligent children. Here is the 
place for fostering the valuable and sup- 
pressing the harmful traits. The school can

ence of Women Workers, London, 1904.

82 EUTHENICS 
never take the place of the home in this. 
With the large classes of the public schools, 
the teacher should not be asked to under- 
take this individual work. Moreover, cor- 
recting a child for personal habits can 
hardly be effective before fifty or sixty pairs 
of critical eyes. 
The office of the home must be to teach 
habits of right living and daily action, and 
a joy and pride in life as well as responsi- 
bility for life. It is not fair that the parents 
should sit back and shift to the school the 
whole responsibility for the future citizen. 
The little modifications can best be made 
in the home, permanent foundations can be 
laid and braced with habits so good and 
strong that nothing can shake them. Most 
powers are the result of habits. Let the 
furrows be plowed deeply enough while the 
brain cells are plastic, then human energies 
will result in efficiency and the line of least 
resistance will be the right line. Every- 
thing, therefore, which influences the child 
must be the best known to science. The 
houses of the land must be regulated by the 
scientific laws of right living. To the  
-P-A-G-E-95
         EUTHENICS 83 
woman, the home worker, we say: “You 
must have the will power, for the sake of 
your child, to bring to his service all that 
has been discovered for the promotion of 
human efficiency, so that he may have the 
habit, the technique. 
To pay a tax today for the benefit of 
one’s children is a principle of insurance, 
of benefit association. This feeling of 
obligation means present sacrifice of ease 
and inclination, and it has been increasingly 
shirked, so that it is not surprising that a 
tax to insure one against future loss by dis- 
ease is an unwelcome proposition. 
The whole question of the child in the 
home is one of ethics, as the writers on 
social conditions have been trying to con- 
vince the world. If the swarms of dwellers 
in the busy hives of industry have no sense 
of their humanity, if they do not use the 
human power of looking ahead, that power 
which differentiates man from animals, 
what better are they than animals? 
No one can be sorry that there are no 
children in thousands of homes one knows. 
It is better that children should not have
-P-A-G-E-96

been born than to come into an inheritance 
of suffering and mental and moral dwarf- 
ing. Social uplift will not be possible while 
parents take the view of cats, or even of a 
well-to-do mother who said, “I did not 
have my baby to discipline her; I had her 
to play with.” 
No state can thrive while its citizens 
waste their resources of health, bodily 
energy, time, and brain power, any more 
than a nation may prosper which wastes its 
natural resources. 
America today is wasting its human 
possibilities even more prodigally than its 
material wealth. The latter deficiency is 
being brought to a halt. Shall the human 
side receive less attention? A sharply 
divided line between home and school is 
no longer clearly drawn. Parents’ associa- 
tions are being formed and are codperating 
with the school-teacher. To what end? To 
the better moral and intellectual atmosphere 
of the home. Physical education has had 
its vogue, but too much as an endeavor 
apart, not as a necessary element in the 
whole.   
-P-A-G-E-97
  EUTHENICS 85 
The pedagogical world is now becom- 
ing convinced that physical defects are more 
often than not the basis of mental incompe- 
tence, and this leads logically to the teach- 
ing of the laws of right living in a practical 
way, not merely as lessons from books, but 
as daily practice. This practice must even- 
tually go into the home, where the most of 
the child’s hours are spent. It is as use- 
less to expect good health from unsanitary 
houses as good English from two hours’ 
school training diluted by twelve hours of 
slovenly language. Hence the imperative 
need of such teaching and example as can 
be put into practice; and since immediate 
house to house renovation and change of 
view are impossible, the school must pro- 
vide for teaching how to live wisely and 
sanely, as well as for clear thinking and 
esthetic appreciation. Practical hygiene, 
food, cleanliness, sanitation, all must even- 
tually be exemplified by the schoolhouse 
and taught as a part of a general education 
to all pupils, boys and girls. 
If this sounds like socialism, let us not 
be afraid, but educate for five or ten years 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  86 EUTHENICS 
all children, so that homes may be better 
managed, and then it is to be hoped there 
will be no need for such school training. 
To live economically in the broad sense of 
wise use of time, money, and bodily strength 
is the great need of the twentieth century. 
This is practical economics. This is some- 
thing which cannot today, except in rare 
instances, be learned at home, for condi- 
tions change so rapidly that grown people 
may not keep up with them. Mothers’ 
ways are superseded before the children 
are grown. 
The school, if it is maintained as a pro- 
gressive institution and a defense against 
predatory ideas, is the people’s safeguard 
from being crushed by the irresistible car 
of progress. I repeat, standards may be set 
by the school which will reach and influence 
the community in a few months. Such 
standards should be a means of safeguard- 
ing the people, and this leads to the most 
important service which a teacher of do- 
mestic economy can render to the people 
in giving them a sense of control over their 
environment, than which nothing is so 
conducive to stability of ideas.
-P-A-G-E-99
  EUTHENICS 87 
To feel one’s self in command of a situ- 
ation robs it of its terror. A great danger 
in America today is the loss of this feeling 
of self-confidence with which the pioneer 
was abundantly furnished. A certain help- 
less dependence is creeping over the land 
because of the peculiar development of re- 
sources, which must be replaced by a sense 
of power over one’s environment. 
Home Ideals 
There is no noble life without a noble aim. 
The watchword of the future is the welfare and 
security of the child. 
Love of home and of what the home stands for 
converts the drudgery of daily routine into a high order 
of social service. 
The economy of right uses depends largely upon 
the home-maker, and brings the return in health, happi- 
ness, and efficiency.'

  No Christian and civilized community can afford to show a happy-go-

in the tomorrow. 
President Roosevelt, Message to Congress, December, 1904. 
The loss of faith brings us by a short cut straight to the loss of purpose 
in life— of any purpose, at }east, beyond purely material ones. To those 
who need money the duty of getting it first and above anything else 
becomes the gospel of life. To those who feel the need of position, 
whether in society, business, or elsewhere, their gospel drives them to all 
means within the law to attain that. To those who have both money 
and position comes the only remaining purpose in life—that of using 
them for an existence of amusement and enjoyment. Is it too much to 
say that never before in our history have such aspirations so completely 
dominated and limited such large classes? 
What is the poor American to do in his present fever and with his 
present nerves, but with fivefold greater powers placed in his hands and 
fivefold greater attention and capacity demanded for their control? If 
sixty years ago the free forces and rushing advance of the republic urgently 
needed the regulation of a powerful and learned conservative body, who 
can overestimate the necessity for such service now? 
When you ask how it is to be rendered, one cannot be mistaken in 
turning first to those priceless qualities in any sound national life whose 
tendency to decay we noted at the outset. Give back to us our faith. 
Give back to us a serious and worthy purpose. Restore sane views of 
life, of our own relations to it, and of our relations to those who share 
it with us. Whitelaw Reid, Phi Beta Kappa address, 1903.

THE HOME AND THE SCHOOL 
NE must not displace the other, for 
one cannot replace the other, but 
rather the home and the school must react 
on each other. The home is the place in 
which to gain the experience, and the 
school the place in which to acquire the 
knowledge that shall illuminate and crys- 
tallize the experience. The child should 
go out to the school with enthusiasm, and 
return to the home filled with a deeper in- 
terest and desire to realize things. 
In morals and manners the school can 
only give tendency or direction to the child’s 
life. The school is not the best place to 
teach ethics. In the family life the child 
himself finds his future revealed, reflected 
by his relations to other members of the 
family. The spirit of coédperation nurtured 
there will develop in the school through 
the more various opportunities of relation- 
ship to others.

The earlier conditions cannot be re- 
stored, even the home training cannot be 
brought back, except on the farm, and there, 
it is hoped, it may be revived. The city or 
suburban children cannot have the oppor- 
tunity to pick up chips when too young to 
bring in wood; cannot stand by and hold 
skeins of yarn, or go to the barn and help 
feed the calves—all most interesting and 
provocative of endless questions. They can- 
not go into the garden and pick berries or 
vegetables for dinner, cannot learn how to 
avoid breaking the vines, or how to judge 
the ripeness of the melons. 
All that is probably not feasible for 
many, because it is not possible to give 
children of this age responsibility without 
oversight, and today’s elders are loath to 
give and are often incapable of giving 
oversight. 
But while these circumstances over 
which, apparently, we have no control, 
preclude much of the valuable outdoor 
work, food has still to be prepared, dishes 
need washing, and clothes must be mended, 
even if towels and napkins are no longer   
-P-A-G-E-105
  EUTHENICS 93 
hemmed by hand. Rooms are still swept 
and dusted, beds are made, and chairs and 
tables put straight. Has any better means 
of giving experience ever been devised than 
these small, daily tasks which differentiate 
men from animals? The care of the fixed 
habitation, the foresight needed to prepare 
the things for the family life in the weeks 
and months to come, the codperation of 
all the members of the family toward one 
common end—all tend toward high human 
ideals. If the wise mother only realized 
the value to the child of helping in such 
portions as are not too heavy, of being a 
part of the life, she would let nothing stand 
in the way of using this natural means of 
development. But with foreign domestics 
whose idea is to get the various duties over 
as soon as possible, and whose gift is not 
that of teaching, how is the child to grow 
into the normal ways of right daily living, 
unconsciously and effectively? 
If the parents continue to throw all the 
work of education on the school, then the 
school must take the best means of fulfilling 
the task. 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  94 EUTHENICS 
Not only has the home put the burden 
of education on the school, but the school 
has drawn the child away from the home. 
The school of today demands much more 
from him than the school of the early New 
England days. It has taken the time that 
was formerly given to assisting in the duties 
of the household; it has taken from the 
home the interest and responsibility that 
were developed through the codperation in 
the family life. School has taken the place 
of home in the child’s thoughts. In the 
morning the thought is of reaching school 
in time, not of the home duties whose per- 
formance could lighten many a mother’s 
burden. 
The school, hurried with a curriculum 
that is wasteful of time and energy, lacking 
correlation in the studies (except in a few 
schools that are noted exceptions proving 
the rule) , has little time to relate its work to 
the home as the kindergarten does in its 
morning talk; so there must come an inter- 
mediate step in order that the school may 
emphasize the home life and industries, and 
that a generation may grow up who shall
-P-A-G-E-107
EUTHENICS 95 
have a knowledge of the daily needs of 
life. 
The interest awakened in the school will 
surely react upon the home. It is like an 
expedition going out to make discoveries 
and to bring back knowledge to its own land. 
The directive work of the school will thus 
become a practical realization in the home. 
Then the cycle will be complete, for while 
the school has separated the child from 
his natural environment for many hours 
and weeks, it is sending him back better 
equipped through knowledge and experi- 
ence to fulfill his place there. 
How shall the ends be gained artificially 
by devices of the school? For gained they 
must be, if civilization is to be maintained. 
To quote from Isabel Bevier: 
“As the home is so inseparably con- 
nected with the house, and our comfort and 
efficiency are so greatly influenced by the 
kind of houses in which we live, much of 
interest and importance centers in the study 
of the house.” 
Moreover, with the house, its evolution, 
decoration, and care, maybe associated much 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
    96 EUTHENICS 
that is interesting in history, art, and archi- 
tecture, as well as much that has a direct 
bearing on the daily life of the individual. 
The philosophers have struggled for 
centuries, each contributing according to 
his experience and vision to determine what 
is the purpose of life. America’s thought 
could be translated into the word efficiency. 
Yes, we might almost say she worships effi- 
ciency. If, then, efficiency is to be the goal, 
what are the means to develop it? Effi- 
ciency depends chiefly upon good health, 
and to maintain this we must first consider 
in the scheme of education the physical 
aids—food, air, water, clothing and shelter, 
exercise and rest—and with this goal in 
view must come also recreation, play or 
amusement, and beauty to develop the 
mental and the spiritual. In relating our 
scheme of work to this ideal we will con- 
sider first the shelter. 
The children of ten or twelve years of 
age have passed the “make-believe” stage 
of play; they want the “real,” but of their 
own kind and age. After little children 
have made and played with toys and fore-
-P-A-G-E-109
  
EUTHENICS 97 
shadowed the needs of the actual home, 
the time has come for the youth to have his 
demands, which are not yet the demands of 
man and manhood. 
At the Tuberculosis Congress, held in 
Washington in 1908, a sanatorium in Eng- 
land, which won a prize, presented among 
many good features a system of graded work 
with graded tools, almost childlike imple- 
ments for the weak and unskilled, gradually 
advancing toward the normal as the strength 
and health of the man grew. So it should 
be with the material we should give to the 
children. 
After the toy age a house about two- 
thirds the ordinary sized house may be 
constructed. A room seven feet square is 
very livable for a child. Three rooms is a 
very good working plant—the kitchen and 
the bedroom, the dining and living room 
combined. Both boys and girls may co- 
operate in planning, building, and furnish- 
ing this home. 
The plan of a modern house may be 
drawn, basing it on the knowledge of house 
architecture through history, of the modifi-  
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 EUTHENICS 
cation necessary to site through geography, 
and the knowledge that science has brought 
of drainage, ventilation, and construction. 
The house could be built by the manual 
training class, or if that is not feasible it 
may be built by one of the firms making 
portable houses. At all events, it can be 
painted by the children, and this will lead 
to lessons on color, the use of paint and its 
composition. 
While the “shelter” is being constructed 
the child must be considering at the same 
time the principles of caring for the 
home, for this would naturally influence 
the thought of furnishing. The simply 
furnished home means less physical exer- 
tion, but not less beauty. The home planned 
and executed on scientific principles of 
hygiene and sanitation means a healthful 
home, a much cleaner home. 
The shelter of the individual has been 
considered ; now comes the immediate pro- 
tection of the child—its clothing. It would 
not be quite practical in this little home to 
enter into the personal activities of bathing 
and dressing. A very large doll, approxi-
-P-A-G-E-111
  EUTHENICS 99 
mating the child, may be used, one large 
enough so that it can wear boots, stockings, 
etc., that are usually bought for the real 
child. Here can be taught also the lesson 
in wise spending. 
The right care of the body must be in- 
cluded among the necessities of education. 
The teaching of the principles of hygiene 
should be closely related to the lives of the 
children. Correct habits, not rules, are 
the proper prevention for all sorts of de- 
fects. To secure and maintain a healthy 
body, habits of cleanliness and enthusiasm 
for health must be inculcated. Such habits 
can be readily impressed on the body while 
it is plastic—that is, while it is young; 
but they are acquired only with difficulty 
and by much thought in after years. Hence 
there is the greatest economy of time and 
energy in accustoming young people to 
habits of daily living which will give them 
the best chance in after life—the chance 
to be “healthy, happy, efficient human 
beings.” Most of the teaching must be by 
indirect methods—illustrations—and so 
the doll may be used again to demonstrate 
and relate facts about the daily life. 
   
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 EUTHENICS 
An old Scotch writer once said, “He that 
would be good must be happy, and he that 
would be happy must be healthy.” As has 
already been said, the great increase of dis- 
ease from causes under individual control, 
such as that which is brought on by errors 
of diet, points to a need for a more general 
education in this respect. The food prob- 
lem is fundamental to the welfare of the 
race. Society, to protect itself, must take 
cognizance of the questions of food and 
nutrition. It is necessary to give the child 
the right ideas on these subjects, for only 
then will there be sufficient effort to get the 
right kind of food and to have it clean. 
Right living goes further and demands the 
right manner of serving and eating the food. 
The home table should be the school of 
good manners and of good food habits of 
which the child ought not to be deprived. 
If all the foregoing principles have been 
developed, if the child has been led to see 
the joy of living through these home activi- 
ties, he will consider the home the true 
shelter, the place where he can have the 
happiest play, the easiest rest, where he can
-P-A-G-E-113
  
EUTHENICS 10I 
study most earnestly, and express himself 
most honestly. 
And the parents, the fathers and mothers 
of children of the city? How far are we 
helping the city dwellers to take advantage 
of city life? The principles back of house- 
keeping are the same, the end the same— 
what are to be the means to stimulate the 
modern home-maker? Show the possibili- 
ties within reach of them; send the children 
home with ideas which the mother must 
consider. 
Education in pursuing the so-called 
“humanities” has been holding up to view 
a hypothetical man in a hypothetical en- 
vironment. 
The pursuit of gold has not been hin- 
dered thereby, and has gone on without the 
restraints of education because of the com- 
plete detachment of ideals inculcated from 
the actual daily life where money meant 
personal pleasure and comfort for the time 
being. 
The power over things gained by a few 
students was utilized by money power to 
hasten all progress. Speed was the watch-
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 EUTHENICS 
word. No one could stop to see what injury 
he had caused. “Get there,” really seemed 
to be the motto. In this scramble for power 
the “purpose” for which life is lived has 
been lost sight of. No “worthy aim” has 
been impressed on the mind of the child. 
An awakening has come and the school 
is the leading factor in the upward move- 
ment. Education is coming to have a new 
meaning, or better, perhaps, is going back to 
the older meaning with new materials. No 
knowledge or power the youth may acquire 
will avail in real struggle for existence of 
the race without a definite aim to hold 
steady the eye fixed on a certain goal. This 
is a law of man’s existence. 
The change in point of view has been 
growing like a root underground. It seems 
to have suddenly sent up shoots in every 
direction. In no line of thought has this 
change come more generally than in rela- 
tion to the things youth should be taught. 
Himself and his relation to his environ- 
ment are now to the front. Instead of ex- 
tolling man as the lord of all created things, 
the youth is made to see that man unaided
-P-A-G-E-115
   EUTHENICS 103 
by scientific knowledge is at the mercy of 
Nature’s forces; that man in crowds is sure_ 
to succumb unless he makes a strong effort 
to keep himself erect. 
Hence the boys are given manual train- 
ing— power over wood and stone, steam 
and electricity; and are taught the prin- 
ciples of production of food and metals. 
The girls are being taught to distinguish 
values in textiles and food stuffs; to manage 
finances and to keep houses in a sanitary 
manner. 
It is the business of the higher educa- 
tion at once to apply the knowledge of 
preventive measures to its own students and 
through them to reach the people, but it has 
been very slow to take up the cause of better 
environment. 
In colleges there is still more emphasis 
laid on external works, such as water sup- 
ply, drainage, etc., than on the more inti- 
mate hourly needs of fresh air and clean 
rooms. The halls, study rooms, and dining 
rooms of colleges are notoriously ill venti- 
lated and not over clean. 
The senses are blunted at an age when
-P-A-G-E-116

they should be keenly sensitive. It is only 
within ten years or so that very many of 
the higher schools have made a point of 
indoor sanitation beyond plumbing pro- 
visions. Outdoor sports have been relied 
upon to give sufficient impetus to the health 
side of education. 
A new element has come into the State 
universities through the Home Economics 
courses, which have been steadily grow- 
ing in favor during the last two decades. 
Within that time several buildings have 
been erected and equipped to teach the prin- 
ciples of sanitary and economic living both 
in institution, school, and family life. 
Probably no one movement has been so 
powerful as this in convincing educators 
of the efficiency of trained women as factors 
in sanitary progress. In no other direc- 
tion is the outlook for social service greater. 
The woman must, however, be more than a 
willing worker; she must be educated in 
science as a foundation for sanitary work. 
Within the next few years the demand 
for trained women is sure far to exceed the 
supply, for the fundamental sciences are 
not to be acquired in one or two years.

realizing their mistake in neglecting the 
sciences.. They assumed that science was 
not of practical use. They assumed that 
educational curricula were stable and would 
go on in the same lines forever. 
The high school is now fully awake to 
these vital factors. Some of the best build- 
ings in the United States are the high school 
buildings, those of the West excelling those 
of the East. By 1911 nearly every school 
will have a course in Sanitary Science. It 
may be under the name of Home Eco- 
nomics, or of Camp Cookery, or of House 
Building, but the idea of better physical 
environment has already taken root. In 
the extension of school work by the em- 
ployment of the school visitor to supple- 
ment the work of the teacher in the grade 
schools, in Parents’ Associations, in Mothers’ 
Clubs, in social endeavors on every side, 
there is coming the study of more special 
branches of sanitary science, clean air, clean 
floors, clean clothes—where once cooking 
lessons were the extent to which the workers 
could lead.

Evolution has at last been accepted as 
applying to man as well as to animals. In 
his inaugural address, November, 1909. 
President H. J. Waters, of Kansas Agri- 
cultural College, said: “... for every dollar 
that goes into the fitting of a show herd 
of cattle or hogs, or into experiments in 
feeding domestic animals, there should be 
a like sum available for fundamental re- 
search in feeding men for the greatest 
efficiency. ... We have millions for research 
in the realm of domestic animals and noth- 
ing for the application of science to the 
rearing of children.” 
Evidence is not wanting that all this is 
to be speedily changed. Man has awakened 
to the fact that he is “the sickest beast alive” 
and that he has himself to blame, and, more- 
over, that it is within his power to change 
his condition and that speedily. 
After all, human life and effort are gov- 
erned largely by the conscious or uncon- 
scious value put upon the varied elements 
that go to make up the daily round. 
It seems to be a universal law that 
effort must precede satisfaction, from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  EUTHENICS 107 
infant feeding to the man building up a 
successful business. The satisfaction grows 
in a measure as the effort was a prolonged 
or sustained one. 
Well-being is a product of effort and 
resulting satisfaction. The child without 
interest in work or play does not develop; 
the man with no stimulus walks through 
life as in a dream. 
The first steps in “civilizing” (?) a 
nation or tribe are to suggest wants—things 
to strive for. Struggle, with all its attend- 
ant evils, seems the lever that moves the 
world. It is therefore in line that health, 
and whatever favors it, is to be gained at 
the expense of struggle. The one necessary 
element is that men should value it enough 
to struggle for it. 
Sanitary science above all others, when 
applied, benefits the whole people, raises 
the level of productive life. 
In the rapid development of our civili- 
zation, the laboratory, the shop, the school 
can be the quickest mediums of suggesting 
wants. 
In an earlier chapter, the indifference to
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 EUTHENICS 
clean conditions, the ignorance of the means 
of obtaining pure food and clean air, were 
dwelt upon, and still later the need of will 
to choose the right thing. 
Now we should consider the means of 
stimulating that choice. So far it has been 
chiefly exploitation for the personal gain 
of the manufacturer, who has persuaded the 
people to buy his product regardless of its 
economic or hygienic effect. Thrift has 
been undermined most subtly. 
“That’s the secret of the whole situation 
we're talking about; it’s easier to buy a new 
shirt than to take care of the one you’ve got.” 1 
All sense of values has been lost, so that 
with no sound basis choice is apt to be 
unwise, unsatisfactory, and is gradually 
dropped, while the individual drifts. 
No more effective agent for the dissem- 
ination of knowledge was ever devised than 
the American Public Schoo!. If only it 
would live up to its opportunities, its teach- 
ers could bring to its millions of receptive 
minds the best practice in daily living 
1 Meredith Nicholson, Lords of High Decision, p. 133.
-P-A-G-E-121
  EUTHENICS 109 
(never mind the theory for the children), 
and through the children reach the home, 
where the infants may be saved from the 
risks that the elders have run. 
To be effective, however, school condi- 
tions should be satisfactory, and teachers 
should be familiar with the best ways of 
living, or at least in active sympathy with 
the medical inspector and the school nurse. 
No more revolting revelations have ever 
been made than those usually locked in the 
hearts of these faithful servants of the peo- 
ple. How they can have courage to go on 
in face of parental and community indiffer- 
ence is a marvel. We shall consider in the 
next chapter how the average parent is to 
be aroused. 
But the leaders in educational and sci- 
entific thought—what of them? The school 
is the pride of the community and meas- 
ures the progress of the community toward 
ideals. Alas, how is pride laid low in most 
public school buildings in the inability of 
most of the teachers to see the relations 
between mental stupidity and bad air. 
The awakening has begun, however, 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  110 EUTHENICS 
and thousands of teachers have responded 
and are urging authorities to burn more 
coal, to employ more help, to keep the house 
clean, to make it more beautiful, to make 
the curriculum more helpful, to make pro- 
vision for good food to be purchased, and 
the hundred ways in which the school may 
be the most powerful civilizing factor the 
nation has. But civilization must not spell 
disease and ruin. 
The economic factor must not be lost 
sight of. To tell the boy and girl that they 
are as good as any does not give them the 
right to the most expensive food and cloth- 
ing they see. How shall they choose wisely 
in the multitude of new things? They 
wish the best, naturally, and all America 
is honeycombed with the wrong idea that 
the best costs the most. An Alaska Indian 
came into the store in Juneau one day to 
buy some canned peas. The storekeeper 
said, “I am out of the brand you want.” 
“No peas?” asked the Indian. “No, only 
some small cans of French peas at forty 
cents acan. You don’t want those.” “Why 
not? Me want the best.”
-P-A-G-E-123
EUTHENICS II! 
The schools of domestic economy, the 
classes in all grade schools, will have to 
attack and conquer these prejudices as to 
values, or, rather, will need to substitute 
right estimates of value before our people 
will choose wisely in distributing their in- 
come, for that is what right living means. 
The division of the income according to 
the necessities of health and efficiency, not 
according to whim or selfish desire, is some- 
times estimated as 
20 to 25 per cent for rent 
25 to 30 per cent for food 
10 to 15 per cent for clothing 
This leaves only forty-five or thirty per 
cent for other things, and the pennies must 
be carefully counted to cover fuel, light, 
amusements, education, books, insurance, 
or investments. Something that the family 
would like must be left out—no matter 
what, providing only it does not injure their 
efficiency as wage-earners, as comfortable 
human beings. 
The sensation of comfort or satisfaction 
is so completely a psychic factor that the 
school training has a great chance to affect
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 EUTHENICS 
after life. The child can acquire the habit 
of being more comfortable in plain, wash- 
able, clean clothes, with clean hands, than 
in dirty, ragged furbelows. This habit once 
thoroughly acquired is not likely to be 
quickly lost. Provision for clean hands is 
a necessity in school, and ways of making a 
small amount of soap and water serve may 
also be taught. AII the while, care is to be 
taken not to introduce unnecessarily expen- 
sive materials or to inculcate over-refined 
notions. 
Sound instruction as to dangers of trans- 
ference of saliva, of nose discharge, etc., can 
be given without also giving the despair of 
impossible achievement. 
The teaching in the classes must have 
this practical bearing on daily life. It is 
insisted on here because unclean hands are 
the chief source of infectious disease. 
Instead of blaming water supplies, dusty 
streets, or even contagion by the breath, 
sanitarians are everywhere putting empha- 
sis upon the actual contact of moist mucus 
with milk and other food, in preparation or 
in serving. It is not a supercilious notion
-P-A-G-E-125
EUTHENICS 113 
to examine tumblers for finger marks, or to 
object to the habit of wetting the finger with 
saliva in turning leaves of books. These 
little unclean acts are the unconscious habits 
that cling to a person in spite of education 
from reading. The greatest service to be 
done today in improving the health of the 
community is in the application of the prin- 
ciples which may be summed up in the 
phrases—fresh air all the twenty-four hours, 
clean hands the livelong day, the free use 
of the handkerchief to protect from contam- 
ination of mouth and nose. 
All these small personal habits should 
be taught in the earliest months of life, 7. e., 
in the home; but if the child reaches school 
untaught, then in defense of the whole com- 
munity the school must insist upon teaching 
them.

  The efficient sanitarian is not so great when he conquers a raging 
epidemic as when he prevents an epidemic that might have raged but for 
his preventive care, and for this result his most continuous and effectual 
work is to educate— educate — educate. 
Wm. H. Brewer, New Haven Health Association, 1905. 
The essential fact in man’s history to my sense is the slow unfolding 
of a sense of community with his kind, of the possibilities of coéperation 
leading to scarce-dreamt-of collective powers, of a synthesis of the species, 
of the development of a common general idea, a common general purpose 
out of a present confusion, H. G. Wells, First and Last Things. 
The great mass of the population is, indeed, at the present time like 
clay which has hitherto been a mere deadening influence underneath, but 
which this educational process, like some drying and heating influence 
upon that clay, is rendering resonant.

In a store an advertisement reads: ‘‘ Any kind of tea you prefer; no

She: ‘* Why, no— ready to do some more shopping.’’ 
Spectator, The Outlook, December 18, 1909. 
OMETHING in motion and some- 
thing to eat attract the crowd. 
The social worker is just beginning to 
realize what the manufacturer and the 
department storekeeper have long since 
found out. 
Why is it not legitimate to “attract a 
crowd,” to do them a good service in show- 
ing them how to save money as well as in 
impelling them to spend it? It is wiser 
to show how before explaining why. 
The force of example, the power of 
suggestion, should be used fully before co- 
ercion is applied. Exhibits and models 
come before law. 
The psychology of influence is an inter- 
117 
 
-P-A-G-E-130

esting study (see Miinsterberg’s article, 
McClure’s, November, 1909). Its princi- 
ples have been grasped and used by those 
who exploit human feelings for their own 
gain. The student of social conditions 
should make a wider and better use of a 
real force. 
Publicity is perhaps first. Exhibits 
showing existing conditions often shock 
people into attention, for it is inattention 
more than anything else that prevents 
betterment. 
It is said that “a knowledge of danger 
is the surest means of guarding against 
it,” but this knowledge must be translated 
into belief and the danger be brought 
home to the individual as a member of the 
community. 
Exhibits may often suggest for existing 
evils simple remedies never thought of be- 
fore. They should never suggest the one 
idea without the other. Even though the 
remedy is not worked out, it should be 
called for. America’s inventive power 
may well be turned on its own social affairs 
as well as on adaptation of European 
machinery.

The man considered in these pages is 
the man in community environment, and 
the discussion is as to what controls this 
community life. It will be acknowledged 
by all thoughtful persons that the prime 
control lies in the purpose for which the 
community exists. If for selfish gain, then 
all is sacrificed to that end. Men and 
women become mere machines and children 
are only in the way until they, too, may be 
put into the service. 
If it exists for mutual help and general 
advance in civilization, then the leaders in 
the community take into account the ele- 
ments that contribute to the future as well 
as those for the immediate present. 
In the confusion of ideas resulting from 
the rapid, almost cancerous growth of the 
modern community, made possible by me- 
chanical invention, the people have lost the 
power of visualizing their conception of 
right and wrong, a power which made the 
Puritan such a force in early colonial times. 
Heaven and hell were very real to him and 
were powerful factors in influencing his 
daily life. The average man today has no 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
120 EUTHENICS 
such spur to good behavior. Perhaps the 
sword of Damocles must be visualized by 
such exhibits as the going out of an electric 
light every time a man dies, by the ghastly 
microbe in the moving picture, by the 
highly colored print or by a vivid repro- 
duction of crowded quarters. The social 
worker has been doubtful of the real value 
of such exhibits, but such reminders have 
their place in a community accustomed to 
the advertising of less worthy subjects. 
A decided recognition of the value of 
exhibits is found in the advertisement of a 
company: “We design and equip Exhibits 
on Tuberculosis, Milk, Civic Betterment, 
Dental Hygiene, Saner Fourth of July. 
Have you our catalogue?” Much of our 
educational work for the dissemination of 
useful knowledge would gain in power 
and directness from an adaptation of the 
methods of the man skilled in promoting 
commercial interests. He knows how to 
apply the right stimulus at the right time 
in order to arouse the desired interest. 
In many ways the adult is but the child 
of a larger growth, who needs something 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  EUTHENICS 12! 
concrete to make him understand. And so 
have grown up the great industrial fairs 
and exhibitions. One comes away from 
these wondering that so much, both good 
and bad, is being prepared for him, and 
stimulated, usually, to work out certain 
suggestions and better many of the present 
conditions. Both the manufacturer and the 
consumer have been helped. 
Wherever it is possible, a working 
model illustrating the chief features to be 
explained should be installed. The expense 
of this kind of exhibit has in the past been 
prohibitive, and moreover the use of such 
“claptrap” has been frowned upon; but 
scientific knowledge is no longer to be held 
within the aristocratic circle of the univer- 
sity. It is to be brought within the reach 
of the man in the street, and to make up for 
the wasted years of seclusion experts now 
vie with each other in putting cause and 
effect not merely into words but into pic- 
tures, and even into motion pictures. The 
fly as a carrier of disease is now shown 
in all its busy and disgusting activity. The 
lesson of awakened attention by such means 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  122 EUTHENICS 
is being learned, and soon lessons in botany, 
in gardening, in housewifery, will be given 
through the eye, to be the better followed 
by the hand. 
Of all means, that product of man’s in- 
genuity, the moving picture, is destined 
to play the greatest part in quick education. 
It is the quintessence of democracy. 
The extension movement in education is 
an evidence of a new social ideal. It is a 
true expression of democracy that the uni- 
versity and school can be utilized by the 
busy working people. Museums that at one 
time were only for the educated who by 
previous training could understand them 
now assume as a privilege the educating 
of all the people. Schools of art and 
science, also, through lectures, bulletins, 
guides, and special exhibits, extend a gen- 
erous welcome to the public. 
The citizens ought to be a gladder, sad- 
der people, stirred and delighted and grate- 
ful for much that the city affords; sad and 
shocked by some of the forbidding, existing 
conditions. That is the power of an exhibit, 
so to visualize a condition that the mind
-P-A-G-E-135
EUTHENICS 123 
really conceives it, never again to recover 
from the shock, to be unmindful of such 
possibilities of degraded existence for hu- 
man beings. 
The influence of these great expositions 
is of a most subtle kind, not often to be 
traced, but there is a noticeable change in 
the estimation in which Home Economics 
is held dating from the time of the Mary 
Lowell Stone Home Economics Exhibit 
held at the Exposition in St. Louis in 1905. 
This illustrated the application of modern 
knowledge to home life, chiefly in economic 
and esthetic lines, all bearing upon the 
health and efficiency of the people. The 
Chicago Exposition in 1893 had its Rum- 
ford Kitchen, an exhibit under the auspices 
of the State of Massachusetts. This prac- 
tical illustration of scientific principles 
modified the ideas of the world as to the 
place and importance of cookery in educa- 
tion. Indeed, there seemed a distinct danger 
that other lines would be neglected, so that 
when the Exposition at St. Louis was deter- 
mined upon this legacy of fifteen years be- 
fore was drawn upon to show the wide scope 
of the subject as it had been developed.
-P-A-G-E-136
124 EUTHENICS 
Boards of Health might pave the way 
for a better understanding of their rules and 
regulations if they would have temporary 
exhibits in public places of some of the con- 
ditions known to them but unsuspected by 
the average citizen and taxpayer. 
Traveling exhibits may show local and 
temporary conditions and may call attention 
to needs demanding immediate remedy— 
with the remedy suggested. 
Permanent exhibits in museums should, 
on the other hand, teach a deeper lesson. 
They should always be constructive and 
should be replaced when the conditions 
have changed. The modern idea of a mu- 
seum is a series of adjustable exhibits with 
distinct suggestive purpose. Such are found 
in the Town Room, 3 Joy Street, Boston, 
the Social Museum, Harvard College, the 
American Museum of Safety, and the Sani- 
tary Science Section, American Museum of 
Natural History, New York. 
The distribution of the printed word 
has become so universal that it would seem 
as if every family might be influenced by 
it; but the scientific title, or the size of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  EUTHENICS 125 
book, or the scientific terms seem forbid- 
ding, and so the whole question is thrust 
aside. 
In the past, newspaper science was 
largely discounted as sensational and only 
one-tenth fact. Scientific workers were 
largely to blame for this. They could not 
take the time to explain the meaning of their 
work, and the few things they were ready 
to say were worked over out of all semblance 
to truth by the writer who must have a 
“story” and who had not the training in 
“suspension of judgment” which the scien- 
tific investigator knows to be necessary. 
There is no concern of human life that 
cannot be made interesting, and the maga- 
zine writers of today understand that art. 
Read the newspaper and the world is yours. 
It is all things to all men. The populariz- 
ing of knowledge is now proceeding on 
somewhat better lines. Intermediaries be- 
tween the laboratory and the people are 
springing up to interpret the one to the 
other. This work is good or bad according 
to the individual writer. Most of it is still 
too superficial. Here is one of the most 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 EUTHENICS 
fertile fields for the educated woman, since 
the evils of which we complain have to do 
so intimately with woman’s province, the 
home and the school. There is hope that 
the trained, scientific woman will take her 
place as interpreter. Her practical sense 
will give her an advantage over the young 
man who has never known other home than 
a boarding house. 
But the expert knows that the man of 
“practical affairs” wants and needs certain 
knowledge, and so seeks another way. Our 
Federal government, through the depart- 
ments of Agriculture and Education; the 
State Boards of Health; the educational in- 
stitutions, have with care and accuracy for- 
mulated this knowledge and are sending to 
the people, in the form of bulletins meeting 
their interest and requirements, knowledge 
in concise and readable form, and so most 
valuable. More than five hundred thou- 
sand copies of Miss Maria Parloa’s bulletin 
on Preserving have been distributed by the 
Department of Agriculture. 
These efforts by both men and women 
have meant independent scientific research,
-P-A-G-E-139
EUTHENICS 127 
which is often the only available knowledge 
for the housekeeper. It is bringing to them 
in their “business” of life the same help 
that the men on the farm and elsewhere are 
receiving in theirs. 
But the written word, however clearly 
put, can never reach the untrained as can 
the voice and personality of an earnest 
speaker with a compelling vitality. Lec- 
tures by those who have been engaged in 
research themselves, so that they have 
absorbed the spirit of the laboratory—not 
by those who have merely smelled the odors 
of the waste jars—are ten times more valu- 
able than even the most attractively illus- 
trated articles. It is well that the person- 
ality of the human being is an asset, and 
that there is a stimulus in hearing and see- 
ing the person who has accomplished things. 
There is always a power in the spoken word. 
The government, with its public lectures, 
recognizes this as well as the private organ- 
ization, and today ignorance is necessarily 
due only to indifference. 
Illustrated lectures followed by litera- 
ture are of inestimable value if rightly and 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
128 EUTHENICS 
not sensationally given. Even then, the 
seed must have time to sprout. 
Man has reached his present stage of 
civilization, however we regard it, by an 
incessant warfare against adverse condi- 
tions. Enemies, man and beast, surrounded 
him; mountains and rivers obstructed his 
passage; fire and flood swept away his dwell- 
ings; but ever onward the inward impulse 
has carried him. 
It is interesting to see how the same 
vocabulary is transferred to the warfare 
for social betterment, “campaign,” “war- 
fare,” “battle,” “fight,” “weapon,” “corps,” 
“army.” And the fight to be won can only 
come through knowledge, its dissemination 
and then its application. 
Publicity today means codperation and 
democracy—all to help, all to be helped. 
All the foregoing methods should be 
used in these campaigns for health, with 
the dictum, “Man, know thyself.”

  The strength of the State is the sum ofall the effective people. 
Dr, Edward Farvis, Massachusetts State Board of Health, 1874. 
When the Americans took charge of Bilibid Prison in Manila the 
death rate was 238 per 1,000 per year: by improving sanitary conditions, 
this death rate was reduced to about 75 per 1,000: here it remained sta- 
tionary until it was discovered that a very high percentage of the prisoners 
were infected with hookworms and other intestinal parasites: then a sys- 
tematic campaign was inaugurated to expel these worms, and when this 
was done the death rate fell to 13.5 per 1,000. C. W. Stiles. 
So the duties and responsibilities of a Health Department are not only 
changed, but they are very greatly increased and are constantly increasing. 
And on broad lines to cause the citizen to do the things he can and ought 
to do, and then to do for him the things that he cannot do, but which 
should be done, is the duty of the State, and that, being interpreted, 
means the real prevention of disease. 
Eugene H. Porter, Report, New York State Department 
of Health, 1909. 
The whole difference of modern scientific research from that of the 
Middle Ages, the secret of its immense successes, lies in its collective 
character, in the fact that every fruitful experiment is published, every 
new discovery of relationships explained, In a sense, scientific research 
is a triumph over natural instinct, over that mean instinct that makes men 
secretive. H. G. Wells, New Worlds for Old. 
Public or governmental hygiene has been chiefly concerned with pure 
air and pure food, and with organisms producing epidemic diseases. Boards 
of health are a recent invention, and in this country they have as yet been 
only imperfectly developed. They can never become the power they 
should be until, first, public opinion better realizes their usefulness and the 
fact that their cost to the taxpayer is saved many times over by the preven- 
tion of death and disease ; second, more and better health legislation is 
enacted — national, state, and municipal; and, third, special training is 
secured for what is really a new profession, that of a public health officer.

LEGISLATIVE COMPULSION 
OVERNMENT is delegated to per- 
sons specially set apart for the over- 
sight of the people’s welfare. 
Personal conduct was free from such 
delegated power in the Anglo-Saxon 
thought. The Englishman’s house was his 
castle inviolate. This was especially true 
of the early American settlers. Laws inter- 
fering with personal liberty, a man’s right 
to drink tea, to punish his own children, to 
beat his own wife, to keep his own muck- 
heap, have been deeply resented by the 
American citizen. Each step in the protec- 
tion of his neighbor has been taken only by 
a struggle extending the common law of 
nuisance to a variety of conditions. 
The protection of the man against him- 
self, and of his wife and child against his 
ignorance or greed, is one of the twentieth 
century tasks yet hardly begun. 
The control of man’s environment for 
131 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 EUTHENICS 
his own good as a function of government 
is a comparatively new idea in republican 
democracy. The cry of paternalism is 
quickly raised, on the one hand, of social- 
ism, onthe other. Each gain has been at the 
cost of a hard-fought battle. But it is cer- 
tain that the individual must delegate more 
or less of his so-called rights for the sake of 
the race, and since the only excuse for the 
existence of the individual is the race, he 
must so far relinquish his authority. 
It is a part of the urban trend that the 
will of the man, of the head of the family, 
should be superseded by that of the commu- 
nity, city, state, nation. 
Even though all the agencies for the 
education of both young people and adults 
that have been discussed in the preceding 
chapters were set in motion at once, there 
would still remain many thousands in town- 
ship and city untouched by these forces, or 
so touched as to arouse rebellion against 
such novel notions. 
Only the child can be educated to ac- 
quire habits of right living so perfectly that 
the suitable action takes place unconsciously.

will be the chief citizens of the republic, 
the leaders of public opinion. Today, how- 
ever, less gentle means, less gradual proc- 
esses, must be used in order that these chil- 
dren may have a chance to grow up. 
In the social republic, the child as a 
future citizen is an asset of the state, not the 
property of its parents. Hence its welfare 
is a direct concern of the state. Preventive 
medicine is in this sense truly State Medi- 
cine, and means protection of the people 
from their own ignorance. 
In the laws made with this end in view 
lies one of the greatest educative agencies 
known. We have referred in the last chapter 
to the need of drawing attention to defects 
and dangers in order that people may know 
what the results of their careless ways may 
be. No surer way has been found to fix 
attention than to attempt to enforce a law 
or collect a fine for disobedience of it. A 
marked illustration of this truth is given 
in the case of the ordinance against spit- 
ting in street cars. In many cities a notice 
was posted in each car—usually with little
-P-A-G-E-146
  134. EUTHENICS 
effect. In some a fine of five dollars was 
added, with little more result. Boston was 
one of the first cities to pass an ordinance, 
and it accompanied the law with a fine of 
one hundred dollars. This compelled at- 
tention—a sum which represented to the 
workman more than his yearly savings, 
more than any single expenditure. To the 
business man, even, it was a sum not to 
be lightly dropped on a filthy car floor. 
This mere statement of the value of clean- 
ness made an almost instantaneous change 
in the habits of thousands. Within two 
days the car floors became practically free 
without a single fine being collected within 
that time, as far as the author is aware. 
The law imposing fines for neglect of 
removal of garbage or of screening stables 
must be occasionally enforced in order to 
express degree of disapproval. A petty 
fine is of little use. 
Conditions of motion, of rapid inter- 
mingling of distant populations—a thou- 
sand miles in a day is now possible—make 
national control a necessity. It is proved 
that quick results may be gained in sav-
-P-A-G-E-147
  EUTHENICS 135 
ing lives and property by that prompt 
and thorough action which well-equipped 
Federal forces alone possess. The stamp- 
ing out of yellow fever in Cuba, the re- 
demption of Panama, the suppression of 
sporadic outbreaks at New Orleans, the 
quick response to a discovery, as in the 
cases of pellagra and the hookworm—all 
these show what a thoroughly alive govern- 
ment may do. 
It is no disgrace to an individual or a 
city to have the national laboratory make 
discoveries, to have the national power put 
down epidemics, as it does civil rebellion, 
for the good of the whole nation. It is dis- 
graceful, however, for the citizen to remain 
indifferent or obstructive, to grumble over 
the cost. The indifference of the people 
themselves is today almost the only stum- 
bling block to national prosperity. 
The time lost to the average worker by 
inefficient labor is a drain on the community 
largely avoidable, and is the cause of that 
other drain on the moral as well as physical 
vitality—charity. 
Preventive medicine is a science by it-
-P-A-G-E-148

self, a combination of social and scientific 
forces guided by research quickly applied, 
and it must be accepted and upheld by 
those whom it benefits, namely, all the 
citizens. The nation is in many cases the 
only power strong enough to command 
confidence, and in the combination of gov- 
ernment effort an international science of 
human welfare is bound to be evolved. 
It is a waste of effort for each state to 
prepare a fly pamphlet. The correctness 
of a Government Bulletin would give an 
added value as well as the rapidity of cir- 
culation. The bulletins of the Agricultural 
Department are an example. 
The Weather Service, with its quick 
notifications, shows what a health service 
might do. A monthly or weekly health 
chart would give the best and worst spots. 
Precautions really workable might be 
furnished the Associated Press. 
In short, system and science might be 
put at the service of the local health officer, 
of the traveler, and even of the housewife. 
The Library of Congress now furnishes 
cards in duplicate to a large number of 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  
EUTHENICS 137 
centers, thus saving time to the investigator 
and giving information often not otherwise 
obtainable. 
The Farmers’ Bulletins of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture are also most valuable 
to the people who are in search of help. 
Such agencies might be extended without 
fear of trespass on any existing agencies. 
Just as the individual, if he is to do and 
be his best, accepts his limitations, obeys 
Nature’s law, and thrives in body and estate 
in consequence, and as the community band- 
ing together makes and carries out with 
penalties for deviation certain regulations 
for mutual benefit, so must the still larger 
groups—the state and the nation—use their 
larger wisdom and wider knowledge for the 
benefit of all. The individual should recog- 
nize the value to himself of this more com- 
plete investigation, and instead of raising 
the cry of paternalism and national inter- 
ference, should welcome all aids to increased 
efficiency. 
State hygiene is necessary to supplement 
municipal hygiene. Often the rural district 
has no other hygiene, and the city and the
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 EUTHENICS 
country are interdependent, the city depend- 
ent upon the country for its water, milk, and 
other supplies. 
Almost all the states are alive to the im- 
portance of milk inspection. As early as 
1869 in Massachusetts, Dr. Bowditch called 
the Board of Health ‘The State Medicine,” 
and quotes from Dr. Farr: “ How out of the 
existing seed to raise races of men to divine 
perfection is the final problem of public 
medicine.” That is the function of all 
boards of health. If factories are incor- 
porated under state laws, they must also be 
governed by the state regulations for health. 
Here in America we are always locking 
the stable door after the horse has been 
stolen. Not until many “accidents” had 
occurred in the use of antitoxins did Con- 
gress pass an act (1902) regulating the man- 
ufacture and interstate sale of the viruses, 
serums, toxins, etc. The supervision and 
control were vested in the Secretary of the 
Treasury through the Public Health and 
Marine Hospital Service. Previous to 
April 1, 1905, there was no official standard 
for measuring the strength of diphtheria 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  EUTHENICS 139 
antitoxin. Previous to October 25, 1907, 
there were as many units or standards for 
tetanus antitoxin as there were producers. 
One was labeled ‘6,000,000 units per c.c.” 
and another “o.75 unit per c.c.,” while, ac- 
cording to official standard, the first had 
only 90 and the latter 770. 
The point to be made is that however 
faulty an official or Federal standard for 
sanitary devices may be, it is a standard, and 
so is of service in protecting the people, 
especially those away from active centers 
of research.

  It would indeed seem that opposition to woman’s participation in the 
totality of life is a romantic subterfuge, resting not so much on belief in 
the disability of woman as on the disposition of man to appropriate con- 
spicuous and pleasurable objects for his sole use and ornamentation. «A 
” was one of the remarks of Achilles to 
Agamemnon in their quarrel over the two maidens, and it contains the little thing, but all mine own,” 
secret of man’s world-old disposition to overlook the intrinsic worth of 
woman. 
W. I. Thomas, Women and Their Occupations, American 
Magazine, October, 1909. 
The president of the British Medical Association about 1892 said, 
‘*] wish to impress it upon you that the whole future progress of sanitary 
movement rests, for its permanent and executive support, upon the women 
of our land.”” 
Ina letter to Madame Bodichon, dated April 6, 1868, George Eliot 
writes : ‘* What I should like to be sure of as a result of higher education 
for women—a result that will come to pass over my grave—is their 
recognition of the great amount of social unproductive labor which needs 
to be done by women, and which is now cither not done at all or done 
wretchedly.”” 
Quoted by Mrs. Nixon in a paper before the Conf rence of Women Workers in England, 1904.

  CHAPTER Ix 
WOMAN’S RESPONSIBILITY 
HERE are about 40,000,000 women 
and girls in the United States. About 
14,000,000 live in the country and have a 
direct and compelling power over the life 
of the community. 
In rural agricultural districts the home- 
keeper is the provider. She practically 
requisitions from farm and garden what she 
deems necessary for the family table. To 
an extent she makes the clothing and sews 
the house linen. She also exchanges her 
perquisites, egg money, perhaps, for furni- 
ture and ornaments. The itinerant peddler 
brings the world’s wares to her door; the 
mail-order houses do the rest. 
“The ideal home is a social and codper- 
ative society in which all of its members 
unite their efforts for the common good. 
This ideal is realized most nearly in the 
country home, where even the smallest child 
has opportunity to be and generally is a con- 
143
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 EUTHENICS 
tributor to the family support. It has come 
to be a recognized fact that boys and girls, 
healthy, industrious, frugal, capable, intel- 
ligent, self-supporting, cheerful, and patri- 
otic, abound in country homes, and that the 
prevalence there of these high qualities is 
largely due to the family life, which re- 
quires each individual from his earliest 
years to bear his proportionate share in 
providing for the maintenance of the home. 
By bringing within the reach of the country 
people educational advantages suited to 
their needs, rural life becomes more attrac- 
tive, country homes are multiplied, and the 
valuable qualities which these homes de- 
velop become the possession of a correspond- 
ingly larger number of the citizenship of 
the state.” * 
The government has recognized the need 
and the possibilities of meeting it in the 
recognition it has given to Farmers’ Insti- 
tutes for women, in which, by lectures, dem- 
onstration, and short winter courses at the 
colleges, the interest of the woman in her 
occupation is aroused. She isnot only given 
1]. H. Hamilton, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Circular 85.
-P-A-G-E-157
  EUTHENICS 145 
help in details of her daily work, but she is 
shown how much the efficiency of the farm 
life depends upon her capability and intelli- 
gence. She is encouraged in the using of all 
mechanical and scientific appliances, is in- 
troduced to the means of mental growth; 
but, best of all, she is given the stimulus of 
social recognition. In the year 1908 there 
were held 832 such meetings in the several _ 
states. In the year 1910 the number will be 
nearly or quite doubled. 
In no other form of society is the power 
of the woman for good or ill so paramount 
as in rural life, in no other mode of living is 
the family so much at her mercy. 
In suburban and city life the family can 
in a measure escape from insufficient care 
and uncomfortable conditions. That they 
do so escape, any student of social tenden- 
cies will testify. The great increase of res- 
taurants, of clubs and hotels of all grades, 
shows one phase of the unattractiveness of 
home life. The city woman is only half a 
housekeeper; she has only one-eighth of a 
house as compared with her rural sister. 
Her control is therefore curtailed until she
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 EUTHENICS 
feels her helplessness in the hands of her 
landlord. She sighs and turns to other in- 
terests. To her must be brought the knowl- 
edge of her power as a social factor if she 
will but use the knowledge she can easily 
gain. 
The city woman has amused herself 
because she has seen nothing better to do 
with her time. The utilization of her abil- 
ity is all that is needed to regenerate city 
life. Without it all efforts will prove fruit- 
less. Education of all women in the prin- 
ciples of sanitary science is the key to race 
progress in the twentieth century. 
As an economic factor, the influence of 
the housewife is of the greatest moment. 
Production on the farm is only one phase. 
The city and suburban dweller is a buyer, 
not a producer. In suburban and city life 
the housekeeper has more temptations to 
buy needless articles, food out of season, to 
go often to the shops, especially on bargain 
days. She thinks her taste is educated, when 
it is only aroused to notice what others like. 
She is led to strive after effects without 
knowing how to attain them. It has been 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  EUTHENICS 147 
estimated by advertising experts that ninety 
per cent of the purchases of the community 
are determined by women, not always ac- 
cording to their judgment, but by a sup- 
pression of it. Woman is made to think 
that she must buy certain lines of goods. 
The power of suggestion has been referred 
to in a preceding chapter. 
When civilization, as it is called, per- 
suaded woman to give up manufacture 
and to become a buyer, the first step in 
the disintegration of the home as a center 
of information, as well as of industry, was 
taken. The housewife and mother were 
made to look to the dealer, and thus to feel 
their helplessness. ‘This sense of ignorance, 
this subconscious loss of power over things, 
only increased the effect of that fatalism 
which the control of machinery was leading 
man out from under. 
It is barely fifty years since woman be- 
gan to ask questions and insist upon know- 
ing, to claim freedom of movement, a chance 
to breathe. The time between has been a 
time of plowed fields, often muddy, usually 
stony, but the furrows are turning green and
-P-A-G-E-160
  148 EUTHENICS 
the harvest will prove the wisdom of the 
plowing. 
Woman had to struggle for right to pri- 
vate judgment and public action. Some 
pioneers had to enter the field of research, 
of investigation, in order that they might 
call to those below that the way was open. 
This vast company, which has been nearly 
untouched by the scientific spirit, was 
warned off the field of investigation, and 
society is paying the penalty of its own 
blindness. 
In the very field where applied science 
can most serve human welfare, scarecrows 
have been set up most prominently. Not 
until society avails itself of those qualities of 
mind sorely needed in the field of sanitary 
science, patient attention to detail, strong, 
practical sense directed by a profound in- 
terest in the subject, will it begin to show 
what height it is capable of scaling. 
The intrusting of so many great fortunes 
to women shows an increasing confidence in 
their judgment of social needs. It shows 
that woman’s education has passed the self- 
ish stage, that it has given a wider vision of 
the whole horizon.
-P-A-G-E-161
     
EUTHENICS 149 
It may be said without fear of contra- 
diction that the future well-being of society 
is largely in the hands of woman. What 
will she do with it? Responsibility is al- 
ways sobering. 
Let her once realize her position and 
woman will rise to the task. Instances are 
not wanting of groups attacking scientific 
and administrative problems in the true 
spirit, without sentimental charity, to-which 
in the past women have been prone. 
If civic authorities felt that women’s 
leagues were informed bodies of women 
whose suggestions they would make no 
error in adopting, more legislation could 
be effected. Too often city councils are 
approached by those who favor some whim 
or fad, and so ALL women’s demands are 
classed together. Much harm has been 
done to the cause by indiscreet, pushing 
women with only a glimmer of knowledge. 
The question is not WOMAN, but ability and 
women. It is better, as a rule, to work out 
ideas through existing organizations. 
All the problems of environment which 
we have been considering would be solved
-P-A-G-E-162
  150 EUTHENICS 
in half the time, yes, in one-quarter, if all 
housewives would combine in carrying out 
the knowledge which some of them have 
and which all may have. 
Infant mortality is controllable through 
the training of the mother and nurse. Un- 
sanitary houses are the results of careless 
housekeeping, usually a product of apa- 
thetic fatalism. Landlords assume that the 
woman willsubmit. When she has a woman 
sanitary inspector to appeal to, matters will 
take on a different aspect. 
Unsanitary alleys exist because the abut- 
ters do not complain loudly enough to the 
right authorities. Dirty markets have been 
so long tolerated because women buyers 
carried the same fatalism to the stalls— 
“what is, has to be.” 
Society is only just beginning to realize 
that it has at its command today for its own 
regeneration a great unused force in its army 
of housewives, teachers, mothers, conscious 
of power but uncertain how to use it. Per- 
haps the most progressive movement of the 
times is one led by women who see clearly 
that cleanness is above charity, that moral
-P-A-G-E-163
EUTHENICS 151 
support must be given to those who know 
but do not dare to do right, and that knowl- 
edge must be brought to the ignorant. Noth- 
ing can stop this most notable progress but 
a relapse into apathy and fatalism of the 
vast army of women now being enlisted to 
fight disease. 
The opportunity has come, the responsi- 
bility is woman’s hereafter. No one can 
take it from her; she has knowledge. The 
door has opened, she has taken the weapons 
in hand, is learning to use them. Will she 
falter on the eve of victory simply because 
it involves some sacrifice of prejudice or 
tradition? Must she not boldly accept the 
twentieth century challenge and fight her 
way to victory, even at some esthetic sacri- 
fice? In another hundred years, then, Eu- 
thenics may give place to Eugenics, and the 
better race of men become an actuality. 
The keeping of the house, the laundry 
work, the cleaning, the cooking, the daily 
oversight, must have for its conscious end 
the welfare of the family. It cannot be 
done without labor, but the labor in this 
as in any process may be lightened by 
thought and by machinery. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
152 EUTHENICS: 
Knowledge of labor-saving appliances 
is today everywhere demanded of the suc- 
cessful establishment EXCEPT of the family 
home. Is it not time that it came in for its 
share? If the housewife would use wisely 
the information at her hand today, it is safe 
to say that in six cases out of ten she could 
cut in half the housekeeping budget and 
double the comfort of living. 
As conditions are, the twentieth century 
sees a strange phenomenon—the most vital 
of all processes, the raising of children, 
carried on under adverse conditions ; human 
labor and life being held of as little account 
as in the days of building the pyramids. 
Women may be trained, to become the 
economic leaders in the body politic. It is 
doubtful if life will be anything but waste- 
ful until they are trained to realize their 
responsibility. 
The housewife was told that she must 
stay at home and do her work. This was 
preached at her, written at her, but no one 
of them all, save, perhaps, the Englishmen 
Lecky and H. G. Wells, saw the problem in 
its social significance, saw that the work of 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  EUTHENICS 153 
home-making in this engineering age must 
be worked out on engineering principles, 
and with the codperation of both trained 
men and trained women. The mechanical 
setting of life is become an important factor, 
and this new impulse which is showing it- 
self so clearly today for the modified con- 
struction and operation of the family home 
is the final crown or seal of the conquest of 
the last stronghold of conservatism, the 
home-keeper. 
Tomorrow, if not today, the woman who 
is to be really mistress of her house must 
be an engineer, so far as to be able to 
understand the use of machines and to be- 
lieve what she is told. Your ham-and-eggs 
woman was of the old type, now gone by in 
the fight for the right to think. 
The emergence from the primitive con- 
dition was slow because the few of us who 
did show our heads were beaten down and 
told we did not know. It has required many 
college women (from some 50,000 college 
women graduates) to build and run houses 
and families successfully, here one and there 
another, until the barrel of flour has been  
-P-A-G-E-166
ee a pn et eee ere ee eT ee eee ree eee 
154 EUTHENICS 
leavened. Society is being reorganized, not 
in sudden, explosive ways, but underneath 
all the froth and foam the yeast has been 
working. The world is going to the bad 
only if one believes that material progress 
is bad. If we can see the new heaven and 
the new earth in it, then we may have faith 
in the future. 
The human elements of love and sacri- 
fice, of foresight and of faith, are going to 
persist, and any apparent upheaval is only 
because of settling down into a more solid 
condition, a readjustment to circumstances. 
As Caroline Hunt has said*: “We may dis- 
regard the popular fear that the home will 
finally take upon itself the characteristics of 
a public institution. ... Human intelligence, 
which suits means to ends, and which is ever 
coming to the aid of human affection, will 
prevent that. So long as affection lasts it will 
seek satisfactory expression in home life, 
and so long as intelligence endures it will 
stand in the way of the extension of the 
borders of the home beyond the possibilities 
of the mutual helpfulness to its members.”

The persistent efforts of the farsighted 
to secure a place in education for the sub- 
jects fundamental to the modern home are 
now respectfully listened to. 
It is, perhaps, not strange that the first 
successes in modern housekeeping were 
gained in public institutions, for there ac- 
counts were kept and saving told. When 
one hospital saved $12,000 in one year by 
an expenditure of $2,000 for a trained 
woman, trustees began to take notice. When 
large state institutions were reorganized 
and made over from unsavory scandals 
into reputable and life-saving establish- 
ments, even legislators took notice. The 
trained woman superintendent proved not 
only more competent but less affected by 
perquisites. 
(I do not vouch for the universal main- 
tenance of this high standard when women 
managers have had longer experience; but 
so far conscience and sterling integrity have 
been attributes of all my expert women, 
even if they have now and then disappointed 
me in endurance or in ability. Is not this 
a fact of great social significance?)
-P-A-G-E-168
  156 EUTHENICS 
It is universally conceded today, only a 
few willfully blind or croaking pessimists 
dissenting, that home-keeping under modern 
conditions requires a knowledge of condi- 
tions and a power of control of persons and 
machines obtained only through education 
or through bitter experience, and that edu- 
cation is the less costly. 
When social conditions become adjusted 
to the new order, it will be seen how much 
gain in power the community has made, 
how much better worth the people are. 
Have faith in the working out of the des- 
tiny of the race; be ready to accept the 
unaccustomed, to use the radium of social 
progress to cure the ulcers of the old fric- 
tion. What if a few mistakes are made? 
How else shall the truth be learned? Try 
all things and hold fast that which is good. 
The Home Economics Movement is an 
endeavor to hold the home and the welfare 
of children from slipping over the cliff by 
a knowledge which will bring courage to 
combat the destructive tendencies. Is not 
one of the distinctive features of our age 
a forcible overcoming of the natural trend
-P-A-G-E-169
     EUTHENICS 157 
of things? If a river is by natural law 
wearing away its bank in a place we wish 
to keep, do we sit down and moan and say 
it is sad, but we cannot help it? No, that 
attitude belonged to the Middle Ages. We 
say, Hold fast, we cannot have that; and 
we cement the sides and confine or turn the 
river. 
The ancient cities whose ruins are now 
being explored in Asia seem to have been 
abandoned because of failure of the water 
supply as the earth became desiccated; so 
was the home of our own Zunis. Does such 
a possibility stop us? No, we bring water 
from hundreds of miles. Will man, who 
has gained such control over nature, sit 
down before his own problems and say, 
“What am I going to do about it?” 
What if the apparent motion is toward 
cells to sleep in, and clubs to play bridge in, 
and amusements for evenings, and a strenu- 
ous business life, run on piratical principles, 
into which the women are drawn as decoy 
ducks? Because this is, is it going to be, 
as soon as a good proportion of the thinking 
people stand face to face with the problem?
-P-A-G-E-170
  158 - EUTHENICS 
I believe it is possible to solve the problem, 
but only if the aid of scientifically trained 
women is brought into service to work in 
harmony with the engineer who has already 
accomplished so much. 
Household engineering is the great need 
for material welfare, and social engineer- 
ing for moral and ethical well-being. What 
else does this persistent forcing of scientific 
training to the front mean? If the State is 
to have good citizens, productive human 
beings, it must provide for the teaching of 
the essentials to those who are to become 
the parents of the next generation. No state 
can thrive while its citizens waste their re- 
sources of health, bodily energy, time and 
brain power, any more than a nation may 
prosper that wastes its natural resources. 
The teaching of domestic economy in 
the elementary school and home economics 
in the higher is intended to give the people 
a sense of control over their environment 
and to avert a panic as to the future. 
The economics of consumption, includ- 
ing as it does the ethics of spending, must 
have a place in our higher education, pre-

  EUTHENICS 159 
ceded in earlier grades by manual dexterity 
and scientific information, which will lead 
to true economy in the use of time, energy, 
and money in the home life of the land. 
Education is obliged to take cognizance of 
the need, because the ideal American home- 
stead, that place of busy industry, with 
occupation for the dozen children, no longer 
exists. Gone out of it are the industries, 
gone out of it are ten of the children, gone 
out of it in large measure is that sense of 
moral and religious responsibility which 
was the keystone of the whole. 
The methods of work imposed by hous- 
ing conditions are wasteful of time, energy, 
and money, and the people are restive, they 
know not why. As was said earlier, shelter 
was found by early students of social con- 
ditions to be most in need of remedy, so we 
see that 
“Tn the first place the state is beginning

ment house is to blame for the silent but 
certain transformation of the home into a 
sty. Instead of accepting this condition as 
inevitable, like a law of nature, and accept- 
ing its consequences, all experience demands 
of those who believe in the monogamic fam- 
ily, that they make a united and persistent 
fight on the evil which threatens the slowly 
acquired qualities secured in the highest 
form of the family. It would be unworthy 
of us to permit a great part of a modern 
population to descend again to the animal 
level from which the race has ascended only 
through eons of struggle and difficulty. 
When we remember that very much, per- 
haps most of the progress has been dearly 
purchased at the cost of women, by the ap- 
peal of her weakness and need and mother- 
hood, we must all the more firmly resolve 
not to yield the field to a temporary effect 
of a needless result of neglect and avarice. 
As the evil conditions are merely the work 
of unwise and untaught communities, the
-P-A-G-E-173

cure will come from education of the same 
communities in wisdom and science and 
duty. Whatman has marred, man can make 
better.” * 
It is not impossible to furnish a decent 
habitation for every productive laborer in 
all our great cities. Many really humane 
people are overawed by the authority, the 
pompous and powerful assertions of “suc- 
cessful” men of affairs; and they often 
sleep while such men are forming secret 
conspiracies against national health and 
morality with the aid of legal talent hired 
to kill. Only when the social mind and 
conscience is educated and the entire com- 
munity becomes intelligent and alert can 
legislation be secured which places all 
competitors on a level where humanity is 
possible. 
Here, again, the monogamic family is 
the social interest at stake. It is a conflict 
for altars and fires. We are told that all 
these results are the effect of a natural, uni- 
form tendency in the progress of the busi- 
ness world, and that it is useless to combat

it. Professor Henderson reminds us that 
tendency to uniformity revealed by statistics 
may be reversed when resolute men and 
women, possessed of higher ideals, unite to 
resist it. Jacob A. Riis holds that these 
evils are not by a decree of fate, but are the 
result of positive wrong, and he dedicates 
his “Ten Years’ War” as follows—“to the 
faint-hearted and those of little faith.” 
In like manner we call today for more 
faith in a way out of the slough of despond, 
more resolute endeavor to improve social 
and economic conditions. We beg the lead- 
ers of public opinion to pause before they 
condemn the efforts making to teach those 
means of social control which may build 
yet again a home life that will prove the 
nursery of good citizens and of efficient 
men and women with a sense of responsi- 
bility to God and man for the use they make 
of their lives.

   CHAPTER X 
INSTRUCTIVE INSPECTION* 
HE checking of wastes of all descrip- 
tion is much in the air, but there is 
less discussion about WASTE OF EFFORT than 
might be expected. Yet effort means time, 
and saving of time saves lives as well as 
money. 
Nearly every investigation of sanitary 
evils leads back to the family home (or the 
lack of one), and a great deal of the health 
authorities’ work is saving at the spigot 
while there is a hundred times the waste 
at the bunghole. The medical inspection of 
the schools was found to have little effect 
without the visiting school nurse, for the 
parents did not know how to better condi- 
tions and in the majority of cases did not 
believe in the need. 
Such experience should give the health 
authorities a cue. Rules and Regulations

Va., October, 1909.

should be enforced, but enforced with in- 
struction as to the means of doing. The 
WHY is not so easily understood as the stu- 
dent of sanitary science seems to think. 
Germs and microbes are empty air to the 
street urchins until they have been shown on 
a screen in a lecture hall or until cultures 
have been made in the sight of the children 
in a schoolroom. One whole school district 
of intelligent parents was converted, many 
years ago, by giving the children in one class 
two Petri dishes each with sterile prepared 
gelatine, with directions to open one in the 
sitting room while it was being swept, and 
two hours after the room had been thor- 
oughly dusted to open the other in the same 
place for the same time. These “dust gar- 
dens,” as the children called them, “took the 
place of the family album” for callers, and 
spread knowledge. 
Hundreds of similar experiences should 
convince any intelligent, earnest Board of 
Health that a teacher by nature or training 
should be in their employ, to be sent WITH 
POWER, like any other inspector, wherever 
ignorance—usually diagnosed as stubborn- 
ness—is found.
-P-A-G-E-179
  EUTHENICS 167 
The health officer whose mother was a 
good housekeeper, not afraid of work, has 
no idea of the attitude of half the house- 
wives of his district. Having been made as 
a boy “to get the dustpan and brush and 
sweep up his whittlings,” he does not realize 
that these houses in the tenement district 
have no dustpans, and that no one would 
bend his back to sweep up litter if there 
were. It is all swept into the alley or the 
street. Cheap, long-handled dustpans would 
be valuable sanitary implements. As has 
been elsewhere suggested, the garbage ques- 
tion in the tenement house needs study and 
must be solved by a practical housewife. 
There are such, and Boards of Health are 
wasting effort and the town’s money until 
they avail themselves of this help in the en- 
forcement of their rules. 
All Health Boards use the strong arm 
of the law, 7. e., a police inspector’s club, to 
drive the ignorant and careless householder 
to keep his premises from becoming a nui- 
sance. The newly-arrived, prospective citi- 
zen, or more often citizeness, fails to under- 
stand what it is all about—neither the words
-P-A-G-E-180
  168 EUTHENICS 
nor the pantomime convey an idea, except 
that this country is topsy-turvy anyway, for 
everything is different in this new land. 
In the process of learning what not to 
do, the dwellers in the alleys flee when the 
health officer appears, and oppose a stub- 
born indifference to his threats. When his 
back is turned, matters go on as before and 
nothing is gained, but an opportunity is lost. 
Law is a potent educator when rightly ap- 
plied, but it may work more harm than good. 
Rules of action clearly explained are 
soon accepted —like traffic rules, notification 
of contagious diseases, disinfection, etc. 
The placing on the force of each town 
of at least one specially trained “Explainer” 
would result in cleaner back yards and less 
illness and, better than all else, a more 
friendly feeling between the officials and 
those they honestly wish to help; for I do 
not think there is often justification for such 
remarks as were made to me by a shrewd 
California countryman when I was show- 
ing him about in the traveling exhibit, the 
sanitation car: “Oh, this is all to get a job. 
It’s another form of graft—to get some 
money to spend.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  EUTHENICS 169 
It is true that the value of many health 
measures does not appear on the surface. 
Sometimes it is necessary to wait for vital 
statistics to prove a gain. 
It is beginning to be thrown in the faces 
of sanitary authorities that the laboratory 
wisdom does not reach the street; that there 
is not enough, or rapid enough, improve- 
ment in general conditions. Newspapers 
are ready, for the most part, to disseminate 
information and benevolent societies write 
tracts, but we must remember how little 
WORDS mean—especially printed words— 
to those unaccustomed to acquiring infor- 
mation that way. 
The actual showing in an alley of the 
process of cleaning up; the going into a 
house and opening the windows at the top 
and tacking on a wire netting to keep out 
the flies; the actual cleaning of the garbage 
pail, perhaps, or at least the standing by and 
seeing that it is properly done—all such 
actual doing, even if it is done only in one 
house on a street, will spread the informa- 
tion all over the neighborhood. 
One of the most helpful offices is to tell
-P-A-G-E-182
  170 EUTHENICS 
the woman where she can get the special 
article needed, and what it will cost, and 
to show her the thing itself, in a friendly 
spirit. Such visits would soon revolutionize 
the sanitary condition of any community. 
Villages need this help even more than 
cities, for there they have fewer chances to 
know about inventions and perhaps are less 
resourceful in making them. 
There may be races, as there are indi- 
viduals, whom persecution drives to prog- 
ress—who do find means to execute unjust 
commands—but the people a health offi- 
cer has to deal with can be better led by 
kindness and will learn from teachers, if 
the teaching is in the form of example or 
demonstration. 
It is an incontrovertible fact that to 
hasten sanitary reform it is only necessary 
to hold out the helping hand; to encourage 
the ignorant citizen to ask for instruction 
and direction, instead of placing upon him 
the task of making bricks without either 
clay or straw. There are times and seasons 
and individuals at which and on whom the 
bludgeon must be used—the greater good
-P-A-G-E-183
  EUTHENICS 171 
covering the lesser evil; but such cases are 
less common than present practice would 
seem to indicate. 
The tenement house mother who has 
only one pan for all her needs and one 
broken pitcher for all fluids does not readily 
understand why she must keep her milk 
bottle for milk only. Who is to tell her so 
that she will understand? 
The men may be shamed into cleaning 
up the back yards and alleys by pictures of 
such conditions in contrast to what might 
result with a little effort. [The famous 
Cash Register yards were started in this 
way.] Neglected spots have been cleaned 
up all over the country by similar influ- 
ences. Why does not the health officer take 
a leaf from this book of recorded good work 
and show conditions known to him? Is he 
afraid of hard words from the owner? He 
will have the approval and support of all 
good citizens. 
Health Board regulations may be left at 
a house AFTER they have been explained, and 
a firm insistence on obedience may then have 
an effect. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 EUTHENICS 
Why should there not be a constant 
exhibit of the conditions found within the 
boundaries of a district, with the changes 
for the better indicated as soon as they 
occur? 
The Health Board office is now in some 
out-of-the-way place, where few people 
ever go and where those who do go are 
frequently not welcomed. Has the Board 
ever asked itself why it is often so mis- 
understood, so hampered in its work? What 
Board will be the first to take an office on 
a busy street and put pictures and samples 
with clearly printed legends in the windows 
—examples of the evasion of the plumbing 
laws on a T-joint pipe; photographs of a 
dairy barn; photographs of a street at day- 
break, showing the few open windows, and 
the one or two, if any, open at the top— 
these would serve as texts for the news- 
papers’ sermons, sure to be preached, and 
back-alley conversations thereon. 
Why not? Rival water companies are 
allowed to show filters to prove their claims. 
The basis of all successful sanitary prog- 
ress is an intelligent and responsive public.
-P-A-G-E-185
     EUTHENICS 173 
The problem is to visualize cause and 
effect to the ordinary individual, too ab- 
sorbed in his own affairs to study out the 
principle for himself. 
The success of the street cleaning bri- 
gade, tried for one season in Boston; the 
improvement in the condition of parks 
wherever receptacles for wastes have been 
placed; the tidy condition of corner lots 
where civic improvement leagues have taken 
the matter up with the children, all point 
to a means neglected by the officials, and 
hence to wasted opportunity and delayed 
obedience to regulations. 
For the position of instructive inspector, 
it goes without saying that a trained woman 
will be worth more than a man, since most 
of the regulations affect or would be con- 
trolled by women. 
A gain in the speed of adoption of 
sanitary reforms would be comparatively 
rapid under a thoroughly qualified woman 
as instructive inspector, and that there will 
not be any great gain until such a measure 
is adopted is the firm belief of the writer. 
Mrs. von Wagner’s work in Yonkers,  
-P-A-G-E-186
  174. EUTHENICS 
begun in 1897 under the Civic League, is 
well known. After three years’ trial the 
Board of Health established her in the posi- 
tion of Sanitary Inspector. Her work in 
the tenement districts has been most success- 
ful. Several other cities have followed the 
example of Yonkers, but the practice is by 
no means general. Yet there is no doubt 
that it would add efficiency to any Board of 
Health. 
The most recent experiment was the 
employment, the past summer, of an inspec- 
tor provided by the Women’s Municipal 
League of Boston, to inspect and devise 
means for bettering conditions in a district 
of small shops where food is sold. The dis- 
trict had been found by the Market Com- 
mittee of this organization to be in need of 
such help. A graduate of the School for 
Social Workers was chosen, who carried on 
her campaign with the spirit of helpfulness 
fostered by her training. She was given a 
badge by the Board of Health, who have 
been most sympathetic and cordial in their 
support. The experiment has been justified 
by the results and especially by the recep-
-P-A-G-E-187
EUTHENICS 175 
tion accorded the inspector by the people 
of the district. It has proved that there is a 
responsive desire to fulfill the law wherever 
its provisions are understood. 
Inspection cannot fulfill its purpose until 
it is instructive. Man and the law will be in 
accord when the benefits of the law to man 
are appreciated. 
It is incumbent upon the sanitary author- 
ities to see to it that their efforts are not 
wasted on an inert, partially hostile clientele.
